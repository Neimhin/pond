It feels like trapped Groundhog Day everyday yet months flying by. March. Stop citing outdated articles. First working Coronavirus vaccine human history that. time alive! Truly age miracles springing overnight live in. Good, angry! Stay angry! Maritime provinces small equipped huge breakout. Fuck entitled tourists (ie: Americans) think rules don’t apply them. Right? Like pandemic response team trained COVID hit charge PPE testing keeping people informed? ideal would been.  


Oh, wait. one Trump fired replace anything two years ago.  


 impression Covid deaths over-reported? in, someone gets car accident, COVID, or, COVID symptoms... that's counted COVID death. see deaths under-reported still following logic.. like heart condition diabetes, catch COVID die ... guess that's COVID death, saying COVID killer scenarios seem inflated. Eh...there lot great doctors honestly reasonably intelligent incredibly persistent you’ll never able score high enough entrance tests pass boards. mention medical schools want high science GPA undergrad. don’t genius smarter average.

And honesty difference good bad physician almost never smart are! bad physicians often intelligent people well. It’s don’t really give shit science keeping latest knowledge give best possible care. shitty docs mostly shitty sloppy job care making much money possible sketchy shortcuts. They’re dumb, don’t really care. church win one bigger gun, United States America military unrivaled. likely going stay superpower planet Earth long time come. Whatever say. everyone love eat, sleep, drink gamble. time, while. sure realize it’s argument. Daily Death rates lower go ahead talk around main points TRY make point trump lol. wild people today still believe GPA SAT/ACT scores adequate proxy intelligence, capability, creativity. RemindMe! 10 days Hi! I’m sorry you’ve feeling sick. Personally, think need quarantine immediately call everyone you’ve hung since dental appointment, especially mom step dad need quarantine well get tested immediately. seen people initially feel ill, recover little, feel ill again, I’m sure you’re woods. Best wishes family. Call everyone may contact with, need stay they’re clear too. That's took hard pass outdoor hookah bar opened near me. Man feel like it’s going get bad there.

Please stay safe. makes sick. better protocols prevention treatment. havent checked awhile, hired gave home loans American bank. obviously lying though idk I’m bothering. result supreme court decision. law (DOMA) sex marriage. 
 actually seen conclusion multiple places. China's Diagnostic Treatment Plan well interview American doctor TV yesterday.

Oh man, I've explained many times back March. Okay go again:

Respirator droplets mean relative big droplet water. big highly affected gravity tend sink fall surfaces matter seconds travel meters. COVID-19 definitely spread via respiratory droplets, easy protect against. Surgical mask protect you, cloth masks degree due large size droplets.

Aerosols start life tiny droplets, small vaporise air second, fall ground. droplets release made distilled water vaporise leave behind tiny solid husk made mostly protein. husks small even gentle air movements stir tend ""hover"" air hours time travel great distances downwind. SARS-CoV-2 viral particles started tiny droplets embedded aerosol particles signs indicate infected way. ability virus survive aerosol hours makes ""airborne"".

However, mean breath one aerosol particle guaranteed infected. SARS-CoV-2 viral particles still tend die outside human body including aerosols. numbers game. Breath enough aerosol particles chances get dosed enough viable viral particles catch it.

So hang around environments high aerosol concentration, likely catch it.

Things increase aerosol concentration:

* enclosed space, poor ventilation

* long exposure duration

* high concentration infected people

* aerosol producing procedures like intubation (this creates HUGE number aerosols, much normal talking)

Things decrease aerosol concentration:

* N95 masks (even though virus smaller filter hole size, aerosol particles big enough filtered. Notice even though N95 100% still gives near perfect protection, again, getting infected via aerosol number's game)

* good ventilation / outdoor

* avoid potential infected

So yes, COVID-19 airborne transmit via aerosol, mostly worry medical worker hospital setting big worry average person, even though danger still there. well aware disputing COVID-19 transmitted via aerosol, weighing weather statement ""yes airborne"" would cause good harm general public. long said medical people dealing COVID-19 wear N95 masks risk aerosol based transmission. agree. It’s hospitals start choosing patients things going get super dark. sense competition here. Lol. Donald trump, pulling last min ever since 18. state numbers low end. Hope start something awful. PC MaStEr RaCe missed south part, please don’t get “FLABBERGASTED” however threaten jail deportation didn’t conform walk past people moon suits get sprayed head toe.

Faced record number hospitalizations patients COVID-19, Seminole County health officials Monday expressed concerns hospitals county may soon reach capacity become overwhelmed coming weeks following Fourth July weekend, time many people gathered celebrate.

On Tuesday, Seminole reported 203 patients treated COVID county’s four hospitals, including Advent Health Altamonte Springs, Central Florida Regional Sanford, Oviedo Medical Center Orlando Health South Seminole Hospital Longwood. That’s 40 patients previous record set July 4, 163 patients hospitalized county.

Seminole Tuesday 13% availability hospital beds, according county data.

Of 203 patients, 30 individuals treated intensive care units, jump five day earlier.

“We worried,” said Dr. Todd Husty, emergency room doctor Seminole’s medical director. “The hospitals hard time staffing. Every single patient see COVID takes twice long [to treat] ones don’t COVID…. every room needs cleaned exquisitely.”

Husty warned county may see another surge positive cases coming weeks, happened Memorial Day weekend.

“I think least 7 10 14 days now, we’re going really see it,” Husty said.

In neighboring Orange County Monday, intensive care units several hospitals — including Orlando Health ORMC, Orlando Health Dr. P. Phillips Hospital, AdventHealth Kissimmee, AdventHealth Winter Park, Poinciana Medical Center — ICU capacity, according Agency Healthcare Administration.

Donna Walsh, Seminole’s officer state’s Department Health, pointed within first six days July, Seminole already recorded 793 positive cases coronavirus. Whereas, Seminole logged 2,272 positive cases coronavirus month June.

“We grown exponentially,” said. “As see virus infectious spread person person easily.”

As Tuesday, Seminole reported 2,570 current active cases individuals COVID-19 county.

Walsh Husty said best ways individual avoid spreading virus wearing masks, practice social distancing washing hands.

“If test positive, isolate home,” Walsh said.

Seminole enacted mask order, took effect July 1, mandates individuals wear mask inside business attending public gathering indoors. order also requires patrons employees maintain least six-foot distance order.

Seminole’s order nearly neighboring Orange County’s mask order went effect June 20.

Seminole’s fast-rising number positive coronavirus cases negative impact businesses economy, Commission Chairman Jay Zembower said.

“When become positive young person,” Zembower said. “And you’re workplace employer understands you’re positive case, maybe interacted employees. employees asked leave workplace. impedes impacts business ability perform business don’t staff continue.”

Zembower also announced Seminole soon begin disbursing $20.5 million received federal CARES Act help businesses individuals county impacted economic slowdown related coronavirus pandemic.

Seminole commissioners July 14 scheduled review disbursement plan money. money doled beginning mid-July. county post application process web site.

The CARES Act – Coronavirus Aid, Relief Economic Security Act – $2 trillion package approved Congress last March. Neighboring Orange County received $243 million. Seminole eligible receive $82 million. Florida's positive rate highest ever today number tests gone down. hotspots like Arizona problems testing ‘Overwhelmed’ Demand Tests U.S. System Shows coronavirus testing remains fragmented, early days pandemic, bottlenecks ones, four COVID-19 tests Arizona coming back positive, highest percentage country, according Johns Hopkins University, indicator enough testing keep new coronavirus' spread COVID-19 metrics moving wrong direction percentage tests positive one telling data point widespread virus whether testing high percentage positive tests means testing limited may reaching sick, virus widespread impacting wide swaths people.

It absolutely blows mind people knew still called ""just flu"". Yeah did, otherwise would heard didn't.... going fast I'm always asleep. Everyday thing never know day actually is. Yes Please “that guy.” need guys. NY positive peak. No. says 70% people nursing home residents **when died** actually died grounds nursing home, instead somewhere else like hospital. says nothing whether first nursing home stay fifteenth stay. also says nothing people entered nursing home (or skilled nursing facility) went home. Note U.S. Medicare pays 8 weeks skilled nursing care qualifying health incident. Lots people go back home can't afford stay. accession criteria study death certificate nursing home location residence. anything Trump make things worse? Like...will make drowning puppies mandatory? truly hate tiny handed man. Since asked nicely might term infection fatality rate (IFR) also applies infectious disease outbreaks, represents proportion deaths among infected individuals. closely related CFR, attempts additionally account asymptomatic undiagnosed infections. IFR differs CFR aims estimate fatality rate infection: detected disease (cases) undetected disease (asymptomatic tested group). (Individuals infected, always remain asymptomatic, said ""inapparent"" — silent, subclinical — infections.) IFR always lower CFR long deaths accurately attributed either infected non-infected class.

CFR 2-4. 

IFR probably like .25-1.5. Pretty sure Americans think cross border problem.

Some us reeeeally trying get shit together. Hope get hang soon :c Yeah it’s like White House refusing let speak Well different “death rates”. like different “per capitas”. answer less border protection, free citizenship anyone asks it. Please keep border closed, country led idiots mean true....I wish know world works. [Good job, many relatives even funny, awesome see. Ontario, [it's trending slowly we'd like, nowhere near fast guys. work smaller place that's split normal service bar area, bar register usually 2 2.5 times much register end night. really break even without alcohol sales. takeout service okay reopening, quite normal food sales far I'd expect; total sales day whole business roughly restaurant area register made, missing 2-2.5x amount day sales (more weekends).  
  
The downside restaurant area money takes hit selling soft drinks, mostly profit, higher cost to-go containers. wait staff making shit tips, either, suffered minimum wage near there, would made money we'd closed. also food really suitable to-go sales, sell; that, combined erratic difficult predict sales numbers, waste usual.   
  
And there's sourcing issues, food prices skyrocketing difficulty getting product first place. pies outsourced locally, business (since buying them) learned place supplied shut might reopen.  
  
We also issues ownership refuses adapt, staff can't afford stay pay rent, clientele (and staff) refuse distance wear masks. Everything heading shut again, know survived first one...they survive second. suspect realized much they've lost yet, running fumes hoping things work out.  
  
Fast food places get takeout. struggles I've seen, hard time believing *any* restaurant end year, likely longer, without significant immediate changes business model. Well different “death rates”. like different “per capitas”. Yes, lawyer know sheriffs work. 😂 'S good, man...may puts ever favor.

Honestly felt blessed Kerala , we're midst bad surge cases , atleast there's politicization masks . Teachers literally heroes deserve money! (unless they're loosely linked republicans capitalism general, case burn jobs houses) point options...

1. Keep going as-is let COVID burn USA year next year, leaving destruction failed economy behind. Going winter uncontrolled growth outbreaks, plus shortages PPE, completely exhausted medical workers national disaster scenario beyond comprehension. Recovery timeframe extremely long painful. Possibly decade. Large number people jobless. Many homeless. 10% cases long-term health issues (as reported recently.) resources extended breaking points.

2. Keep going as-is pray miracle widely available inexpensive treatment quickly. vaccine truly works short long-term side effects, both. not, return option 1.

2. Lockdown 2.0 - real deal demonstrated successfully countries around world. 60+ days. wartime orders factories US able produce PPE testing supplies mandated 24/7 production starting day 1. Extremely slow openings. Masks mandatory. questions, big fines. Extreme contact tracing. Quarantines quarantine hotels. Localized outbreaks locked down. slowly emerge life bit different, one actually live function in. Economy slowly gets back feet. avoid worst-case scenario. Yes, hurt us. Many businesses shutter. many, many lives directly indirectly saved. Many educated virus fight it. Let allow fight treated make room understand science.

Based past week, past month, since January, it’s sadly pretty clear path on. 

You may agree think roses unicorns. “doom gloom”. argue. doesn’t take rocket scientist see month ago, see today, pretty good idea month behind little restrictions truly control spread.

We pretty much critical time period country month. Sucks happen living it. Sucks even watch daily stream absolute failures zero regard lives American citizens (especially taking serious part reduce spread stay safe.) parties moving towards extremes. 



The right definitely responsible starting trend. responsible asymmetrical polarization political spectrum US.

The simple explanation theres restrictions get test anymore, outbreaks catching much bigger percentage actual cases used to. guess would Florida it‘s currently 1 3-5. need 2 weeks. Two damn weeks do-nothing lockdown. That's it! can't fucking handle that. Governor waiting Soros run money. hoax costing Soros billions day least. Derp. lawyer, clearly try though.

Canada truly place lmao fml country. cannot allow government sweep dead rug simply politically inconvenient. national shame tragedy. It’s great convince you’re special you’re capable going “nuh-uhhh” adding nothing substance, let’s focus direct concrete point made here: currently 160,000 total deaths US previous years point. Unless *better* explanation came from, nothing say all. want claim it’s *coincidence* happened global pandemic killing people thousands around world, better prepared damn good explanation 160k extra people dead expected. 

So it? America really can't afford dumb people atm link incorrect, thank you.

They're independent contractors “isnt good country” right, unfortunately. no, saw many redditors sweet Sweden’s method. experts, swear worked.

January 21 Dr. Zhong Nanshan said interview China's largest television station, wearing masks useful, recommended wear medical surgical masks, N95 masks high-risk (hospital) places worn, medical N95 masks need left health care workers.

This first voice world since epidemic, masks useful.

Lowered fatality rates reflect effective treatment, testing catch asymptomatic/mild cases (also allowing isolation silent spreaders), better protection extreme risk groups many factors. seeing US states ICU's capacity several months opening, time let guard lower percentage cases dying several months ago. also nothing fear, responsible get past this. many Americans adopted philosophy headed backwards cohesive, responsible countries able truly enjoy freedoms. ironic...

Sure. got climate science everything else, too. always crap shoot. prefer go majority. average average last 7 daily results likely reporting cases primarily 3-10 days ago. still massively skewed towards past. helps normalize weekly peaks valleys. dumb fuck that's old affected it. ""Fuck everyone else expense."" United States death numbers definitely underreported... hospitals aren’t much better... masks next couple years say....vaccine depends one effective....youre wasting time 50% efficacy vaccine.....Therapeutics still stink arent enough
The virus wild card now, effecting people randomly far severity symptoms....

I dont wanna die shit got lung issues girl smokes probably so.......I cant see happy ending - anyway.

But hopefully you. keep calm. Maybe talk doctor anxiety medication? Frank tank! Frank tank! almost certainly error data source pull from. guess data wrong column: 14,717 people *recovered from* COVID today, based [this appears data originated (Google gets via Wikipedia, Wikipedia seems get there, pretty sure get CDC).

Edit: Numbers subject change, naturally. Deaths time edit +969, reflects significant uptick that's likely result national holiday causing things get lumped together. They're +2k per day they're 20k infections per day.

At 55k infections pet day, probably hit 5k deaths per day.

Especially hits old Florida obese south US. We’re not, we’re really not. agree Canada.

Lot people follow get enough ones infected answer would help lot. First off, Malaysia 1/10th population US. /u/Ai_Myst pointed out, Malaysia million population Texas yet comparing Malaysia entire US A.

Also, /u/lysiel112 mentioned, comparing daily figures Malaysia cumulative one US. cumulative COVID-19 tests Malaysia currently stands 816k US ~37 million. that'd 2.2%, 0.005%.

However, Malaysia also total 8,674 confirmed cases COVID-19 US ~3 million cases. means Malaysia 2.2% number tests US, Malaysia also 0.3% number confirmed cases US.

So look number tests per confirmed cases, Malaysia done 94 tests per confirmed case US done 12 tests per confirmed case. Hence, Malaysia conducted tests confirmed case COVID-19 US. also look ratio way around (i.e. number cases divided number tests) would yield positive rate. positive rate Malaysia 1.06% US's 8.08%. Malaysia less COVID-19 positives testing compared US.

All figures I've mentioned cumulative. want see daily figures, consider checking [this data many countries well. people. Oh, see, learn lot growing older.

Isn’t opposite government?? problem Swedish healthcare - problem government's handling pandemic. government played responsibility-hot-potato care homes regions thousands people lost lives. second fact different types flu one one year, next normaly different type flu. first type flu comes back years later differwnt enough get again.

It's fucking slaughterhouse. cows still claiming real. * Closing high schools universities
* Limiting gatherings 50 people (leading many events cancelled)
* Promoting social distancing working home wherever possible
* Extra generous sick leave make stay home light symptoms
* Recommendation travelling, within outside country (leading greatly travelling)
* Mandatory distance restaurants, restaurants failing comply closed

Far strictest restrictions, certainly say nothing done either. Main reason things recommendations mandatory Nordic people listen government take recommendations seriously.

Also, ""herd immunity strategy"" something attributed Sweden foreign media, never goal. visited vietnam 

There 0 food one pretending virus gone. one wants to. cannot ignore actual needs children distance learning work for. IEPs, special needs, etc cannot replaced. know answer is.

Yes, Social distancing sounds good implement school. Yes, children need schedule, routine, fee safe properly develop. sanitizing plan, sounds great paper, teachers put practice; something long time knowing it’s failing endeavor (see Child Left Behind increase standardized tests). 

How socially distance 30 kids 20x20 foot room? keep kids touching other? tools/toys? get keep masks on? Elementary/moderately-severe disabled students won’t understand; secondary students take assholes, citing parents sue school. And, god, law suits attempted: “first amendment rights violated bc making kid wear mask!”, “Bradyn failed can’t breathe!” stress teachers - dealing behaviors due masks teaching less, without additional compensation, probably complete paperwork due necessary sanctions, adjust teaching style yet another online format due administration signing every “buzzword technology grab”. fear still students teachers, shared en masse.

However, hospitalisations rate following spike cases, death rate follow hospitalisation rate certainly. keep going way weeks months unless done contain done (in Southwest).

Remember actual death rate COVID 0.5 % - 1 %. means expect something like 2 million dead Americans within year two unless actually contain virus. Sure will. everyone dead, immune. everything. Except zombism. I'm guessing never actual third world country. people would begging come back within hours. Yes confusing us.

2) people packed like sardines, make magically immune Covid 19 outside. I'm sorry media convinced otherwise.

Thank you. bot naive thinks pandemic nothing politics. touches everything. really changed opinion people Burrillville, RI declared “First Amendment Sanctuary” people don’t wear masks, directly governor’s mandate.

Things open mean people making money, may actually opposite hours cut, positions cut, less traffic general. 

That alot things actually open. much people would believe. Interesting thought, let’s forget talking COVID-19 here, let’s say theres super duper deadly virus spreading people dying left right coming contact it. 

Under interpretation Constitution, warrant mask order?  Perhaps, also noted they're counting cases church attendance even though that's they're implying headline. example, they're counting ""over 80"" cases summer camp happened Christian. article really garbage. mean, ""joke""? Thank read much need really ramp wasn’t sure think Yeah, thought pretty big one post well reasoned. want timeline actually competent leader making decisions, healthcare political debate Ah gotchu. Yeah states looking rough. Especially Texas basically size European countries show extent triage system, ie many people turned away cared for? It’s Trump made political issue. don’t think meant to, lot supporters aren’t brightest get knees praise every move. agree, really think comes lack education, rational person would listen scientists doctors. pilot friends one regional airline one delta stated based number layoffs vs number pilots hiring mandatory retirement age 65. COVID-19 huge pilot shortage major airlines start retiring 600 900 pilots year due age alone. lot pilots typically able extrapolate many furloughs could happen versus many said happen. Originally based demand Delta months back expected maybe furlough half pilots would 7000. number since come 2500 calculating demand travel versus supply pilots pilots. doesn’t make sense furlough pilots hire six months later even year. It’s typically cost-effective keep pilots skyhigh training cost retrain pilots new aircraft. Delta may need half pilots right retirements training costs may retain pilots ends becoming cost-effective keep instead following retraining new aircraft. currently working getting pilot certificate COVID-19 thrown career plans hoping airlines hitting minimum requirements 2022 2023 may get pushed back airlines hire pilots furloughed first hiring new people. point it’s really still guessing game COVID-19 cases still rising. Waking dead fulfill requirements terms freedom. safety measures Disney World put place?

Wishing luck; stay safe. take: taking going outside getting sun, bit doesn’t hurt. getting vitamin anyway. talking someone last night. people retiring, class sizes managed? haven’t tested wonder got passed cats. indoor cats couple weeks ago 2 got bad kitty colds. Took week recover. don’t know else would gotten sick. churches get free tax money make everyone sick. town they're packed, protection except power Jesus. People sitting next eachother, hugging, shaking hands. Sadly they're really open get money. sickening. Everyone town gonna get sick. Im lucky already it. One thing I'm hopeful we've come long way understanding coronavirus causes blood clotting treating start. ooooh sweet, love double stuff oreos. u skim 2% milk person? me? whole milk, live life dangerously u know? 

u got club card number thingy? cool, cool. union? issue masks general, reasonable non-woven fiber masks protective enough closed room, car even church infected person receive high enough viral load get severe case COVID-19. 

You actually clear concept issue mask information is, repeating others say bothering think technical issues. Religious people shouldn’t worry. Jesus save them. doesn’t, means get hang together afterwards.  means absolutely none poor detainees virus. Thank Jesus spread unsanitary crowded conditions. always seem US churches dumb shit? churches (and religious establishments) closed since 1st case.

When open, 30 people allowed (usually seats 120-130 here) there's communion limit spread. Please clarify practice social distancing, wary droplets (lots shouting protest), suggests virus airborne, lockdown beaches.

But time virus isn’t spread protesting despite fact breaks guidelines? right. masks help prevent spread virus masks prevent contraction virus. well could probably mixture since NYC emergency services instructed bring cardiac arrest patients resuscitated scene declare dead site. post made brain hurt 3 seconds.

Fyi, use firefox 548 tabs open. mom teacher PA also hoping re-open. can't believe people even considering it, people forgotten quickly germs spread buildings??? would close 2 weeks anyway, gunna stick even try it. muh black lives matter Bets lmfao Ah true please explain make point. stated people obese without overeating. 

Post evidence support statement, withdraw it. probably also realizes person replaces probably ""believe"" science. possibility could even antivaxxer. part wave infection began many states started reopen economies forgot obesity too! know August 7th’s value, I’m goddamn genius I’m suffering I’m worried myself. I’m worried high risk boyfriend, beyond I’m devastated what’s happening country. really don’t know could see what’s happening US OK it, even though it’s likely affect personally. Fucking disgraceful. Future generations look us ask fuck manic let office, answer. someone spiritual religious (not enough church least) think it’s power, money, genuine worry peoples souls that’s guiding push people back church buildings? 27 year old college graduate mountain debt, really feel like handed already shit situation see quality life ever improving this. wish every day would catch virus would take rate, good thing everybody get standard daily dosage multi-vitamins. Total cases. There’s currently 1.6 million active cases without outcome Worst global recession 300 years letsgooo sure, point. online option, whatever reason people give way person. areas US lower caseloads areas Canada areas Canada higher caseloads?
Do source that? aware finding masks valves actually good, obviously allow airpath virus  Jewish married Jewish man, supposed wash hands every meal using toilet, starters. still really get tan suit meme  one claiming ‘know’ deaths lagging. Ask question, know virus timetable?

I showing facts, continue deny. 
- death curve historically lags case curve week
- USA deaths declining despite cases increasing
- young don’t die COVID. research. 

And TX FL near NY levels, compare total deaths deaths per capita. Another fact. 


All speculation fear not, happened notice happening lot places. i'm sure there's better metrics determine peak versus idk wtf call happened california, kind slow incline current. weeks drop guess call peak weeks peak death rate known.

what metric would want use determine whether somewhere peak? guess two weeks steady decline would work, clear path graph? take look 7 day moving average cases, may 15th, till may 27th us could said hit peak, june hit new high point. 

cities/counties probably better way look question peaked might peak again. we'll know NYC pretty soon case counts start going smaller scale towns large meat packing plants prisons (trousdale TN comes mind) would good way know whether place peak Schools giant Petri dishes *before* started, children gross. Used worst you’d get cold stomach bug, straight die... survey, conducted Elon Poll using online opt-in sample marketplace, asked K-12 schools state reopen fall. According survey, 34% questioned residents opted full-time return, 38% thought part-time return would best. remaining 29% chose full-time remote learning. Let church stay open!!! jesus Justin ...we know. dissful. mention flu season coming up.  saw french friends partying like crazy last week instagram stories. social distancing single masks. thinking gonna regret soon. guess kinda started eh?  I'm willing believe social currents society experience high levels interaction therefore achieve high levels infection (certainly greater 20%) time isolated groups experience low levels infection. 

That would certainly case live - capital infections (and deaths) whereas remote spots few. one large outbreak county far capital seemed odd seeing county infections transpired Covid patients released Dublin hospitals back care homes area caused outbreak several nursing homes due staff double jobbing homes.  Tampa / Orlando, they're hit hard hard south beaches. comparison number cases Miami 55K vs 15K two locations I'm going at. think metro areas similar size. get school May. Good point threaten arrest people health condition. Influenza, STDs, hepatitis, meningitis, HPV, pneumonia - kill people everyday sending police victims even though infect others. 

Our nation laughing stock right since coherent plan dealing this. Instead threats arrest need strong federal state leadership, rational choices, scientists leading way instead politicians, public education programs, aid workers instead corporations, door door testing like. 

Above need get mentality police, guns force save us public health crisis created. Hopefully y’all don’t get sick lose jobs. healthy ❤️ many cases came thousands protesters wearing masks social distancing?

Can find reports protests led outbreaks? many made big deal never find articles including spikes cases anti-lockdown protests. articles find say 70 72 cases ""large gatherings,"" could come anything.  yeah Michigan didnt lock up. Thats twisted fact ever. 

Yoi twisted everything yoir favor lol. even swedish people unhappy outcome Full disclosure: member science team ResearchExplained.org Hybrid approach gets worst worlds- kids teachers eventually infected longer period time plus parents stay home anyway offdays babysit kids. Yes, sadly fully aware this. Made laugh though... sad laugh. 

Fuuuck. Money talks Masks everywhere go N.C. That's baffles much say ""children rarely get sick covid."" like... know teachers adults...right?  Anyone claiming jobs return optimist opinion based reality. uncharted territory. People absolutely worried future job market possible entire industries never recover. Trump say either yesterday day ""in two three weeks really good shape"", Believe stupid things, win stupid prizes. Apparently POTUS works weighing responsibility faith leader, Mr. Satterwhite said, returned beliefs. “My personal belief is, faith God,” said. “If God wants get Covid, I’ll get Covid. God doesn’t want get Covid, won’t.”

At point realize people want meet maker sooner stop wasting effort resources trying protect people themselves? Elon Poll found 38 percent North Carolinians prefer hybrid approach, K-12 students learning home part time learning in-person part time allow greater physical distancing inside school classrooms,” Elon reported. Well sure, can’t go 100% LOL apparently [very hard price even generics expected high well. drugs especially oral drugs like HCQ cost pennies less per pill, stuff sounds like nightmare. can't determine headline perfectly written really bad taste.

It's like saying left handed people spread covid.

Will studies keep coming get parents back work? betcha. #Duterte/Fauci2020 multiply number 10 weeks. metric use really interesting -- # years given county spent American frontier. Turns predictive! say that, think second: really, really worse current asshole charge Right?

His (Berlusconi's) former personal doctor, named Zangrillo, trying convince people virus weakened deaths overcounted (when contrary true). proof, suspect, Berlusconi may instructed so. Look, everything gain: lackey manages convince enough people abandon precautions causes new outbreak, he'll able attack government taking enough precautions. people keep behaving, cases keep decreasing, he'll say government overreacted... didn’t know Facebook page Rallys, protests (regardless political side), mass meetings, things contribute spread virus. fucking hate Greg Abbott. Injection effective. 

/s necessarily. kids centers could caught virus adults. evidence I'm aware specifically daycare center-age kids transmit large scale (i.e. superspreader). would odd infect anyone else, know kids U.S. outbreaks caught it.

STDs aren’t airborne Fauci says things Trump says those. 

Both say wear masks now, downplayed masks early on. 

Both downplay importance testing, Cuomo accused president helping testing Fauci said testing isn’t important anyway. 

Both say take seriously now, said early won’t threat. 

I don’t understand good guy comes from. said corona virus bad flu. said people get covid-19 risky behavior compared AIDS, blaming victims both, breath. get pass things like that?

Where Trump mainly differ far I’ve able discern shutdown. Fauci continued shutdown, strongly agree that. people seem wave away fact he’s constantly wrong many things he’s central figure arguably worst public health effort world right now. Filed duh. Didn’t SK Israel see cluster outbreaks schools reopening? dont want fuckin roommate. I'm adult. That’s high standard hold too.

Fair enough, I'll admit extremely limited post history egregious shills usually see sub, stand said, (people listening experts right now), entirely possible judged unfairly. number people subreddit working spread doubt discourage advice experts, suppose could say *me* internet paranoid.

Curious many fixated absolutes? 

I guarantee people make Titanic dead long hit ocean floor. That's rich coming American. first country Europe hit hard pandemic first EU get country locked down.

The West can't know organs available. Organs viable short time outside body. can't freeze heart lung keep need it. China schedule procedures weeks advance US billionaires can't manage same. So, why? answer source organs.

[This like show US exporters enabling China's brutal process. simply possible without help selling China need. may pretty dumb question please bear me... since already beaten covid, become reinfected ? wanted baby sitter would sending child public school paying college tuition first grade. Get clue  Good point. assume it’ll somewhat similar cold weather too, people want nice cozy indoors. main problem isn’t temp rather people dumb. Maybe move Canada then, eh? possibly, necessarily. antibodies line defense infections permitted area, seeing friends outdoors maintaining distance considered reasonably safe, masks recommended plan long conversation. Take care really need explored? fucking obvious get. Well, want philosophical compare position deontological argument, entire comment highlight potent criticism consequentialism? That, given right circumstances, morally justifiable cause person suffering alleviates suffering others?

This Surgeon's Dilemma massive scale. Given logic, would morally justifiable surgeon kill one healthy person, harvest organs, use organs save five sick people's lives.

It's thing, except much harder quantify. know many people die. And, can't really say much average person's quality life increase stop Lock down. would increase, sure, can't really put hard numbers. many lives worth percentage increase QoL? 

Also, factor QoL effect caused (potentially) million Americans dying. That's going affect tens millions people pretty massive way. Yes, would still morons. think really underestimate amount people believe president he’s president. large aren’t politically active used leader doesn’t lie every single time talks. proper leadership I’d say 80% greater refusing wear mask wouldn’t problem. idiots like get positions power? school Melbourne caused largest outbreaks state? country population California comparing it’s response country population 320 million. don’t get it... mentioned NYC, got hand earlier on, it’s noteworthy experienced precipitous drop infections, hospitalizations, deaths, etc continues dropping.

No doubt there’s room consider timing mitigations effect mitigations versus recovered population mediated infections, but... may well something there. look teaching online. Maybe market families intend home school. I’m sure they’d rather pay teach kids themselves. think theory hopefully, would like flu go away summer months (of course ignoring southern hemisphere issues early on). BLM protests Arizona must've massive huh Spain. United Kingdom. Ecuador. India. heard stories Belgium, Netherlands France, pretty sure happened well. mention poorer countries South America, Africa (where coincidentally South Africa, one countries actual testing, no. 1 cases deaths) Asia.

oh wait...

it exist... lived florida 20 years recently. seems like friends/family back home feeling much right now.  do, we’re seeing outbreaks summer camps daycares put period .com url Wow talk nonsense second half that.  says truth can’t much lunatic lol AA posted International Routes Summer 2021 early 2022 rough. Regional domestic travel recovering, international ops mainline run decimated. Everyone conveniently ""nurse friend"" say blahblahblah deadly. People making shit up. friends still straight think covid hoax. People LIVID (maybe all? sure) municipalities making masks mandatory public. ask US tell numbers fudged. ask places bad locally (the nursing home grandfather lost 70 residents covid, around 300 beds - Orchard Villa Pickering) tell deaths actually caused covid. 

What drives crazy obvious value money economy fellow citizens. fair share selfish dicks here.

The general consensus public large seems Doug Ford (provincial conservative), Canada whole, dealt crisis reasonably well. also miffed Trudeau Fd cottage closed parliament height crisis.  Mutations random changes due virus copying itself, always work perfectly. bit terminology fitness, much mutation effects survivability virus. COVID lot asymptomatic incubation period spread, virus spread kills host. way, lethal strain may necessarily less fitness, could still spread near speed. Though bet people would socially distance became much deadly.

You right though, many viruses show decrease lethality time, that's say virulent strain would worse evolutionary speaking. know many liberals believe god, right? Maybe majority, it’s small number. Community really important. happens small towns areas poverty. Intergenerational care important hugely valuable resource well. can't transplant whole families communities, instead people want tear apart people. means putting elderly sub par facilities leaving kids cheap daycares (which still wildly expensive) working double shifts. 

Extreme poverty slightly less poverty loss home, land, community. awful choice instead many programs could use enrich bolster communities. US that. Duece services presidential toadstool. Treatment Success Combination Two Over-the-Counter Drugs -- Pepcid Zyrtec***

JFC around time, counties major cities seeing lot cases instituted mask ordinances. county still seeing increase cases deaths, seeing decrease ED visits. That’s fairly good news true, start see decline week two. ability social distance... would think. Interesting. Thanks sharing. surprise much Colorado. Outside Denver imagine crapshoot, even Denver mask usage varies greatly depending neighborhood store go to. hell political? literally talking facts. You’ll one crying someone care hooked ventilator I’ll perfectly fine. It’s always money. Church provides place lot hurt lonely people congregate. everything pessimistic. honestly 650 total cases month we’re seeing 50k cases per day indicative churches pretty safe.. Say happens immune system kills without getting sick – create antibodies cells case someone getting sick fighting off? Thanks.

I'll look suggest. promises we'll see. “NoT cHUrcHes wAy!”

People definitely don’t care churches long place go told better others. never said that, saying people's selfish actions undermine people's testimony. So, Sweden this? capacities apparently already overused. Imagine Dodger Stadium completely filled. Imagine people carrying COVID. Imagine many people come contact spectators course 1 week game. remember accounts single day. 

This fucked up. love asking churchgoers think Jesus would say/think illegal immigrants. Smoke tends start coming ears. much knowledge virus importantly way greater testing capacity. mention 20% NYC immune. chaotic March. much like outdoor smoking bans municipalities use discourage smoking populated outdoor spaces like parks, beaches, concerts etc. (a common sense decree) brain unbelievable way communicating. American Puritanism. course everyone wears clothes, freak see nipple TV. Bodies must hidden, non-procreative sex must forbidden. flu. There's nothing magically different one except herd immunity yet. 2009 H1N1 another pandemic, estimated 90 million cases US, luckily effective treatments limit deaths hospitalizations. effectively cut economy half couple months. Everyone sick. made statement ""Those uncommon symptoms"" burden proof produce evidence symptoms uncommon. try deflect question question own. ""Do even wear mask outside?"" way relevant statement originally made. point, lack masks really can't used excuse anymore. 

At start, (the broad public least) know kinds masks would effective. lot conflicting information. months now, we've dozens studies show even flimsiest material front mouth nose helps. Practically every Corona informational website (WHO, CDC, etc) guides make common household items. 

You get walk around uncovered face find ""proper mask"". Take bandana, T-shirt, scarf, whatever. much better nothing. Obesity comes consuming excess calories, compared calories body burns exercise normal daily activity. 

Please explain “racism” makes people (of color) eat. cute. county Mandatory mask order public. Went store weekend, 30% people wearing masks, 70% were, 40% eith r dangling ear, covering nose, covering chin.

Stay strong!  Saw someone /conservative claim sub controlled CCP yesterday lmao  Maybe influencer content creator make rejoice Go look death curves country Europe Worldometers - fact look them. 

Every country locked different dates, bother. 

What effect have? 

Every county peaked April peaked, fell dramatically, viruses do. ones locked early probably slowed spread bit, maybe better job protecting vunerable. knows? 

Either way, last 6-8 week, countries re-opening. Society getting back normal. see difference? see expotential rise deaths? see rise mortalities all? 

No. Infections may increasing / decreasing Europe's mortality rates well average. What's wrong that? Let die! get go heaven faster! want? issue people killing that's want. literally 0 empathy left people. Amount hours worked isn’t competition. gatekeep encourage people “grind” “no days off” mentality, retail stores MLMs love. mean 650 cases month spread across 40 locations across US honestly doesn’t sound bad. expecting way given we’re seeing 50k cases per day.. headline super deceiving. Kind feel like 650 indicative churches pretty safe actually. national guard would pull weapons citizens make happen (remember, Florida parents guns). 
This NEVER happen. 

There’s general, colonel, likely Lt. Colonels would open complying order can’t fire every officer military.  
It would literal end whatever party tried it, first priority every politician self-preservation. ~~reddit mods~~

Admins That's damn shame. I'm sure district going do. think people would agree small tax make sure there's money measures, like Penny Tax awhile back. seems irresponsible anything less. know teachers fighting pay years. hope they'd put politics aside make sure needs get done everyone's protection gets done. get it, why? precious daughter? take people dying streets, mass graves, etc... everywhere 

I promise you, still take seriously care. People care people America. Shit, people living 3rd world poverty conditions America one gives shit.   Same. parents zoom phone calls months now. federal government pushing schools open back up, unmitigated disaster. really care countries done. stupid, ineffective, authoritarian strategy increases scope prison-industrial complex, terribly ineffective leave prisoners vulnerable this.

Leave centrists make dumb Excel-spreadsheet utilitarian moralist calculation think arresting people ""common good"", going disproportionally affect poor people BIPOC leave exposed, somehow ""woke"".

I'm gonna call bullshit well-meaning centrists said stood BLM white ""leftists' said ""defund police"", think somehow fine.

People think arresting people locking people mitigate crisis people think racist classist prison police apparatus affect them. know lot parents unsure anxious sending kids back.  parents shitty immune systems susceptible COVIDs nastier symptoms, option really awesome.

Agree. Many grandparents raising children due imprisonment/drug/mental health crises country. important demographic choice! went Cu Chi got lost 10 days tunnels. Last meal one gave plane.
Poor guy. TF Ducey gunna do? I’m disbelief hasn’t made statement week half allowing spread. 

We implemented masks two half weeks ago, time start see leveling. closed bars facilities little later measures yet take effect.

But nothing it’s getting worse. 

We need close dine restaurants, limit gatherings 10, 50. need HARD LOCKDOWN, know governor doesn’t stomach save lives. 

We need leadership, need better citizens, need miracle. It’s funny many churches (are) eager reopen found rent, staff, facilities maintenance don’t get paid thoughts prayers lol. yet thoughts prayers go-to solution many churches rest society’s problems. Except protective group gives evolutionary disadvantage point, real ""record"" US finally week without setting new record. business. hired elementary teacher building classroom. way school
Is normal year kids didn’t learn anything home. Toronto, Canada, test results come back within 10 hours, results posted online. first result mid March 3 day turnaround, online posting then. Ironically, takes months scientific information reach guys. 

Did receive message wearing mask public yet?  Scared people masks? must really hate Halloween! done excellent job summarizing new controls implemented Arizona. Well, best say keep eye symptoms, shortness breath, lethargy, chest pain, heart palpitations... get doctor right away let know history. hindsight brother warning signs, didn’t think anything 30. need censor them? dangerous. sub like thousand Members. even stupid, freedom speech. 

Tell people caught Corona died others around spread bullshit get gullible ignorant people believe it. 

I know comes shock people, freedom speech always good thing speech riles country start WWII convinces 40% population pandemic real. 

Both situations causing many many unnecessary deaths. 

Your pleas freedom speech cries fall flat people dying. numbskulls, probably It’s 10k daily report. Depends live US.

I'm small city Oklahoma. one worst states gdp wise, yet contact tracing stopped major spread city.

Currently 59 cases, 57 recovered, 1 death, 1 active. 

Of course population density huge factor well, main reason wont see huge spikes rural areas outside large cities factories/plants/distribution centers. guy bot. non-stop posts 12+ hours now. please source this? tracking number tests, person tested multiple times looking number tests per million accurately multiple tests certain individuals skew results make appear current close 12% population tested?

Have really tested 12% US population realistically far lower percentage population? Visited parents last weekend nyc. (Outside maintained distance). masks new jersey. Saw 0 people wearing em, chin. dont see working there. Haha see there. That's wife's name. Alex Jones sells fake antiviral pills... Subreddits like nuked. international health crisis, dumb debate world flat. Reddit needs stop giving anti-science people platform. would valid statement everyone faced 100% risk death caught virus. realistically average person 0.5% chance dying. Unemployment poverty much dangerous many people. evidence suggests don't, yes. well went thinking .00092% preposterously small number learning fact rare is...and outrage level remains same? Ya wonder people dont take panic crowd seriously? doubt even many Christians read part either, get much circulation weekly sermon suppose!

That quote way avoiding patronising presuming know :-p live half community outbreaks tied restaurants bars expected, holiday excuse.

Facts man,  love updates. possible add % positive last 5 Wednesdays section? 
 
I see % positive today near 30. Id nice see compared last Wednesday's % positive cases. Tax free business lot property management companies owned super wealthy people use launder money keeping empty. million people, Sweden suffered **40 percent deaths United States**, 12 times Norway, seven times Finland six times Denmark. technically possible one candidate win &lt;1% vote, &lt;1% vote results majority right states. would require nearly 0 turnout opposition states though. sub literally exact type echo chamber extreme. similar dilemma posted pink floyd's ""the wall:"" can't dessert eat meat. Israel tried reopen schools early closed weeks due 1000+ infections traced schools. god, need go someplace inside worship. rate we're going USA double August... people wear masks ...😷...and social distance stop spread... indigestion try natural quick digest. Take like tums eventually rarely need it. It’s amazing.  worst kid class drop course, big issue guess I'm asking question, ""What 'working American interests' look like?"" ah yes, virtue American social colorblindness school shootings think police obligated enforce MCL 750.158 - 15 year felony?

http://www.legislature.mi.gov/(S(4owl4wdmk4pujcy4u5ck3ojb))/mileg.aspx?page=GetObject&amp;objectname=mcl-750-158 *we* could easily something it, would covered base now. fixed game favor there's really much done short revolution, we're still far content yet really nice hear good news once. see many teachers drinking kool-aid either returning. Yes. Remember said ""35 check time"" regards women. “...it possible we’re relative lull compared virus could fall.”

Agreed. much calm storm storms continue current path without absolute massive action end August. It’s avoidable, direction headed daily.  Yes, came time shut down. months ago now, Americans' memories attention spans, especially times stress, conveniently short. comparing deaths deaths false equivalency? know what, getting anywhere let's circle back month see going shall we? wonder point trying make. seem like lot little him? seemed think keeping schools closed general necessary.
""Children get infected, so, yes, got careful,"" Fauci said. ""You got careful got careful may spread it. Now, make extrapolation open schools, think bit reach."" Benito DeSantis? make upset guy responded first correct. 

I never encountered anyone deliberately pulling US based data. would illegal. I’ve discipline people made technical negligent mistake causing violate policy.

If someone deliberately collecting data American put prison. someone fucks accident depends situation Look plus side: people die, denominator shrink well! ramp launch new cable channel next January - RNN )The Racist News Network)

Going head head Fox, constant stream vaccine conspiracy theories, stories immigrants raping women, testimonials Confederate Generals, good looking women interviewing former marines.

This along side launch TWhiter - new social media platform Awe, billionaire upset virus hits revenue...big meanie virus... province ppl still want Canadians stay let alone Americans lol. Keep border shut Treat like I’m dumb hell maybe am, change? 

If go inside home inside stores grocery shopping (but always face covering though nothing like N95 mask), never lingering, anything change?

Oh, I’ve gotten take like four times running exercise dozen times. Still safe things? ahh totally even realise population difference Georgia Texas. Texas guess always going look much worse considering double population No? “Good News* flair lmao Yes, surge capacity like originally did. time wont one place overwhelmed places extra resources. 

Several large regions overwhelmed, regions operating normal capacity.  governor might want look happened Mussolini failed people. Next term... UN new one, nicely done. Hope lawyers got paid front legal costs likely wiped away future bankruptcy data supports anything like 2% outside nursing homes. Belgium, final conclusion non-nursing-home population 0.6% men 0.4% women.

But yes. high chance things get catastrophic week. Hmm, I’ll play.. % people actually dying decreasing. 10% NYC, __ (insert number 1% here). See it’s deadly! let infection run rampant! /s prince ?! allegiance Republic ! DEMOCRACY !!!!! RemindMe! 6 months  *US concerned China much influence WHO*

*US leaves WHO, guaranteeing China gains even influence due abdication American leadership funding* Uh huh. Trump can’t even recall troops Afghanistan. Full blown mentally unstable conspiracy theorists found sides aisle. don’t offer valuable service communities, basically they’re asking right spread COVID upside customers Deaths started accelerating Texas, Florida, Arizona two weeks ago

Edit: two weeks ago Insanity. China isn’t list. don’t spend way WHO. assume, would think bribe higher level officials get bang buck way. worst bit try tell deaths rising yet deemed negative wanting deaths rise. Like want deaths rise I'm realistic Social media full crackpots. people county waiting lose start civil war 2.0 shits crazy America days support decline American hard power. care soft power, believe individuals free choice whether want watch American movies, listen American pop music. starting think using crisis ""thin US herd"", especially minorities since hit most!&lt; Careful wish for. world headed since fall USSR probably last time world truly multipolar prior WWII.  hope called parents get children taken away. Good Lord. That's fucked read man. Can't believe come many Americans. 

From one random dude across internet another, hoping family stays safe somehow things work you! test means virus, mission accomplished. Aren’t positive results misleading unless they’re de duplicated? assume people take test regardless they’re sick sick Plus big spread started US came travelers Europe emme ole vieraita rakastamaan. tiedät säännöt, ja niin minäkin. Jesus, knew deaths would high today expect 1k. NSA monitors communications entities.

NSA (or least used have, Trump cleaned slate) strict policies forbid American-American monitoring. *American-Foreign* communications, that's another story. Things make sense realize controls President.

Did miss bounty story everyone glazing over? 4-5 week lags reporting deaths numbers. 

half Florida's COVID cases entire pandemic happened last 2  opinion private citizen less informed experts WHO. following evidence, better can, spreading know. what's happening.

I'm obviously suggesting report every rumor true soon hear it. saying, due diligence science coming months ago made nearly certain virus spreading aerosols. would've bet lot it, I'd bet. way they've talking glaringly incongruous science months. need conservative fear losing credibility? finger pulse all? incompetent mess reaction credibility toilet. far step science strategy recommend them? Really?

It's repeatedly proven can't trust them. wearing masks long people **because** trust CDC. can't trumpet trust untrustworthy fear take mistrust wrong direction. jumping manipulation bandwagon, sow mistrust. like authorities, admitted lied people effectiveness masks manipulate them. many deaths cause? comments encourage non-mask wearers? Hah.

Here's situation: Sadly live world authorities trustworthy. accurate view reality ones trust authorities. ones wearing masks authorities tell effective. ones washing hands. ones thinking a/c circulating air they're told droplets fall ground pretty quickly. sucks way. best everyone. Oh. My. God.

You made imagine absolute **shitshow** would occur bunk ass medical study published internet stated covid 19 turned homosexuals heterosexuals. 

The horror. bot would need Google account can't flit regions every 90 days. saying entities set 40,000 - 60,000 Google play accounts Ireland alone? understand motivation would be. downvotes could people pissed unfounded cynicism.  Outside obvious wtf there, hell government supposed assess effectiveness response? 5 day incubation period *plus* another 10 days results? They’re still looking numbers last month right now. hate much. must attend 90% days course offered (with exceptions) order awarded credit course and/or promoted next grade. requirement remains force 2020-21 school year.  must ensure send child school campus child COVID-19 symptoms.

That going work well. say ""I see color"" walk away Liberalism dead reddit whole mean get shit talk US running concentration camps COVID-19, shoe foot? hate damn Asians wear white robes burn crosses front yards!  Well afford sue can't hard Good. I’ve seen patients test positive back March time frame. very, ill, pass. 1 80- something year old woman well. get free one NHS, sister managed similar situation (she tested negative though - still unsure). think applied online, might well! Assisting spread Chinese narrative - it’s bold strategy ...  little chance hit 200k deaths end month. way see happening massive data dumps bunch states they've reclassified bunch past deaths probable covid deaths, similarly New Jersey dumping around 2k deaths single day June 25. even something like that, getting 200k deaths July 31 longshot.

IFR dropping since start pandemic due better treatments, better (relatively speaking) prepared hospitals, changing demographics infected. Based epidemiologists I've seen, believe IFR around 0.3-0.4%, vs 0.8-1% start pandemic. even hospitalizations covid double 1st peak, deaths probably still 1st peak. would take hospitalizations around 3x 1st peak see deaths reach 1st peak levels. right around 70% 1st peak levels hospitalizations. see deaths starting increase coming week start pick 2-3 weeks now, 200k end month. It’s fact it’s highest 30 days, see 1,000 next Tuesday. 900,000 new cases added last 25 average rate 40,000 per day, 2 percent cases die it’s 800 per day. I'm using count, calculated hand since today's numbers done yet. Non-doctors evaluating medical stuff goes counter doctors kinda we're pickle begin with. figure way make work app would huge game-changer. Except brains apparently course also talk loud means air expelled mouths higher force. Like count aint done day either want hear trump says twitter death rate 1k-2k day (and maybe even more) think going happen 50-60k day positive people US? Though greedy owners show much gratuitous Idiocracy sex violence get away with, US news supposed much gore, case EU light years advanced us things? I've even heard video game blood green Germany matter little kids game bit much think.

What show troops? Iraqis killing other? Palestinians Israelis? Wouldn’t ‘fuck’ you’ line? Best way get everyone tested.... get positive, get two weeks Ritz plus room service within day health department calling result room number want point cases July 4th we'll probably see within next 2 weeks. Problem reopening soon rushed. gradual slow reopening would worked better prince... show respect. #So much “small government.” Half people wearing make fucking nose fucking chin... Seriously look fucking stupid wear correctly. Yep, going unbelievably bad. I'm seriously concerned safety lot people, especially healthcare workers (who risk shot assaulted usual) vulnerable violence (elderly people, people young children, etc.) undoubtedly going need support top threatened happening middle dangerous situations. 

It's going seriously fucking grim. I'll bet 50 pushups be. Many deaths backlogged holiday weekend. state report anything weekend. fuck's wrong you? “killin’ it” mean killing Americans, yes, yes have. Pence going Hell. agree shouldn’t open asking keep going bankrupt, yes understand rough shop Shes minor forced demented parents Pretty much every country managed exactly that. hypothetically, contract virus feel like whatever want, end asymptomatic, spread someone higher risk group, parent grandparent example, die it, you’re totally cool that? got work. go Walmart bug spray maybe 10% people masks. Chili's shitty chain restaurants packed.

I thought NC bad people fucked. Yes, everyday Saturday! China waited new year celebration. Easier mute answering hanging Still go trial. Legitimate reasons separated out, including someone mentally fit even stand trial. pick it. tough one? Come dude. Don’t pander. You’ve done great job, tell straight up. hope parents criminally charged. criminal negligence, involuntary manslaughter. I'm terrible person. can't help suspect since many hospitals desperate financial straights preferentially treat people pay, versus people drive closer bankruptcy.

What think? getting pretty bad South Texas. San Antonio quickly running hospital space. 10 12 hospitals Rio Grande Valley 100% capacity turning people away. Laredo pretty common point travel two areas many young people move bigger areas like valley San Antonio school better opportunities. last months lot traveling back forth see families probably spreading virus.

Places like Laredo valley sufficient staffing, expertise, equipment supplies handle this. They're among desired areas end medical professionals extensive networks medical centers like bigger metro areas state do.

And people South Texas stop summer bbq's birthday parties holiday get togethers ""their family"" dozens people. Ron DeSantis giant jerk &amp; patsy GOP.

In Florida August, almost classes would indoors, air conditioning – situation virus circulates easily. Even students get seriously sick COVID, would certainly transmitted swiftly teachers, janitors, bus drivers, students' families home.  GaTech pretty good Engg school. sub-specialties (operations research), factually better program MIT. broadly yes, across engineering disciplines, MIT though Stanford Berkeley may something say it. assume good people. friend immigrant said ""Is better child eagle hare?"" asked feelings American intervention old country. provided anything? Cell phone, computer? seeming likely getting job back PUA wfh job could beneficial state covid19 could work me. I'm MN sure go finding contact tracer job. That's it: billionaire bailouts. Yeezy get one, Tilman. pisses circle jerks news subs holier thou people assigning kind moral failure people Covid. It’s respiratory infection transmitted cold flu. get touching door handle, it’s STI something. international student probably didn’t even know it. passed US catches connecting flight NS. Canadian customs let through, yet turns bunch stick ass Anglo-Canadians jerking bad America is.  picture teams constant communication running 24/7 shifts round clock. never need big money pumped much anything less. lab much limitations grant money. Imagine limitless funds scientist/techs/manufacturing ask question fair! friend bought this. Hes used worked welder said good stuff. havent tried longer seconds nice STOP GIVING TRAFFIC TICKETS STOP PULLING DRUNK DRIVER Florida man running Florida? Using whole country representation Canada's population density pretty misleading. 66% Canadians live 4% Canada's territory - area within 100 km US border.

Also Canadians concentrated fewer cities, I'm connecting dots inherently makes fighting virus easier? Seems like one cities major outbreak, impact Canada's overall numbers would much higher one American city major outbreak. Right?? Fauci fired. feel like should’ve heard time MAR 1... sigh Kayleigh ""I never lie you"" McEnany. Florida CA. glad left CA decade ago. dunno, immune compromised individual still largely trapped home, I'm feeling kind ghetto-ized like mask modern-day yellow star. really. Kentucky state troopers posted outside man's home early days US outbreak refused isolate. Armed guards still wins extreme measure. can’t even tell time anymore without looking, day, long it’s since last asked etc check voice mail? already makes outlier.   Yes  wrong sub lol Oh cut racial economic disparity crap. Rich people effected less economic means avoid around people. Millionaires ones going parties supermarkets pay someone them. 

So yes, poor middle income families effected this. poor, (middle income, here) bigger issue someone sitting 800,000 dollar house gated community groceries delivered week otherwise never leaves. actual fucking scientist PhD viral immunology (and thesis cells). cell response part adaptive immune response, innate immune response. this.

while bad complication, hard read much this.

correlation imply causation, especially single case report. news (caveat- date literature regarding COVID pulmonary complications). Backlog? anyone validate? believed imaginary friend would save them. Well yeah agree that, it’s every weekend said still use pattern right? ""Quest cited ""unprecedented demand,"" especially South, Southwest Western regions country coronavirus cases spiking.""

At point, enough capacity demand. unfortunate, definitely contribute spread time? days blurring together point. Yes! news thinking state ramped testing every street corner. last week slight temperature tried get tested. way hard. Lots websites took circles testing centers hour away. finally find urgent care near says walk testing, awesome! think. go ask COVID testing due temperature, say go exam room fill iPad info. Well iPad doesn’t let proceed unless click “general exam” ask lady said yeah put general exam do. tell want get tested. says well bill general exam get tested. walked out, still scared they’ll bill cause iPad info, definitely see nurse doctor. I’m glad cause someone else said cost $200 urgent care general exams. Anyways next day tried couldn’t find testing everything full. finally found testing CVS four days started trying get tested. wanted sympathize hard was. Oh aware. However, those? serious debtors. Justice debt, prison debt credit card debt. would rather default today, starve loose home. Original comment said people dying covid hospitals counted covid deaths. said hospitals interest report covid cases covid. 

I sure hope responsible anything hospital yours, reading comprehension skills like that. careful. Lmao back track. 

Of course beds tied population. 30% population 4 state’s means 70% population outside states

Based comment means 70% hospital beds also outside states. CDC proven banality ineptitude effectively care say anymore. I'll continue err side caution. unfortunate yeah I'm NJ went thru lot somehow people seem already forgetting Wait hear DACA missed South part, digress. almost like reopened; everyone assumed safe go. 

For record, I've done take confirm, signed sub end January already active. weird it, massive country, massive military massive world power, citizens, can't seem make decisions one. Theyre frozen, desperately without leadership. fuck guys?

How many thank 'others service', acknowledges person sacrifice... time, refuse take even minor inconvenience lives. 

It feel like duty country. average age faculty much higher employees chicken place street. Sitting room full people breathing talking 1-3 hours much dangerous variety people coming chicken joint 5 minutes takes pick order. People need receive lecture person understand material, need receive food person consume it. 

It's hard understand take seconds consider literally variables. Harvard worst university West Cambridge. I'll head Walmart 30 minutes closing tomorrow see anything changed. I'm one wearing mask whenever to. I'm Norwalk. China's long past way, hell 1/3rd America already that's they're trying work shadows. social media makes easier.

They also track day people tested. ? Don’t dumbass problem many people (in lots places) think reopen = back normal.

THATs problem.

if started wearing masks distancing (6ft, stay home) Feb may never lock first place. probably move next one, e.g. Moderna, J&amp;J work safely dispose couple billion doses. Seriously answer call 2nd time row right first Hey dude, hear you. love Las Vegas. hope guys get shit together soon. love visiting states. born raised there. awesome country many ways. really fucking COVID thing. taking drug travel ban. replied travel ban. replied death rates. I’m sure you’re able multiple conversations once.  No, do. also aware lie credit is. Thats privilege's, facts, privileged, someone would paid debt already wow amazing healthcare america. im glad pay asshole this. /s ....that's works. Cases mortality rate did. Might testing more? Didnt reopen/cancel closure gyms county? Literally today? News flash - 90 days required. Evidence: China, Italy, New York. needs policy states reopened early getting people killed. Thank fuckwit president. rheumatologist tried treat virus got lucky finding one antiviral seems worked weakening virus. I’m sure full viral load is, fewer viral symptoms fewer flare ups overall. it’s anecdotal seems working. treats several people recurrent EBV though multiple us “lab rats”. Ew, one right mind would drink labatt forget Florida governor I’m getting tested tomorrow, ease mind question symptoms

I possibly exposed dental office Thursday. Employee tested positive Saturday started mild cold symptoms. productive cough Sunday, yesterday cough gone felt pretty terrible fatigue, chills, body ache, low-grade fever. 

Today I’m almost back 100% terms feel thankfully, realized completely lost sense smell. tried smell tea tree oil smells like nothing it’s wild sensation. possible gotten feel sick 3 days? 

I’m complaining I’m nervous could passed others. I’ve worn mask public religiously I’ve spent time mom stepdad. also testing tomorrow Quitting smoking causes flu like symptoms pneumonia heavy smokers, along extreme levels stress, think best time quit. always darkest dawn, vote 11/4/2020. Chinese found what's happened， virus may already cross border.
I think us citizian really want china nuke something stop covid19 us, w house good choice. Excess deaths interesting see, especially given push open end financial assistance coupled evidence underreporting deaths Got tested Friday. Told 2-5 days. Figured would call check 4 days now. Told labs completely overloaded expect results another 7-10 days..

Could end 2 weeks get results. Everyone getting fatigue situation. Even hospital staff take masks they’re sitting near offices see big groups people eating lunch together maskless chatting eating. Right case loads low enough hasn’t caused issues everyone better get back track soon we’re losing testing capacity since they’re diverting covid tests south. lot them, unfortunately, exhausted need break.

We need mental health services healthcare workers place- well themselves. Roll 3 sided die. Two chances get long damage one don't. That's bad odds. Makes wonder there's zhihu topic called 美国流感 obsessed chinese people pour twitter look signs coverup use sulfur dioxide emissions houston region proof government cremating thousands daily. going shift narrative something else. mental gymnastic crazy. Florida retarded mean closet much social gathering, chance show clothes, dating pool, business network, get dopamine rush collective behavior. praying closet gets jesus that's church Hahahahaha!!!!

Oh gosh good! 8% among positives tested. Sure many tests run daily NY. many found positive. Ontario. daily interview interviewee saying mutated previous, deadlier strain kills people spread much. hypothesis newer strain transmissible less deadly. moose bit sister   even dad, take care little cousin feel exact way. Hell miss sports much too, that’ll return time right. I'm sure anything important making sure many people wearing masks possible given crucial containing virus. Keep shit across river bruh, want negativity here. come army know difference love Filipinos way culture around dinner table absolutely delightful Ehhh... I'm sick stupid leaders conspiracy bullshit pull butts... gets called edjamacaded individuals research via brietbart, faux news, Facebook riled protect freedummbs... sounds like blurb game Plague hmmm... need add tornadoes 2020 disasters bingo card saying mystical ""societal cohesion"" everyone points to, simply result effective government leadership, trust science epidemiology, decisive mandates, coordinated action.

It may part that, yes, also part societal cohesion. Maybe better term, referring fact (in experience least) societal norm - e.g., wearing masks public - South Korean people willing openly flaunt societal norm accept whatever societal shame cast way.

In US, opposite. leaders saying, ""Wear masks."" businesses saying, ""You must wear mask enter store."" citizens store give disapproving looks someone wear mask. yet still someone wear mask *and make scene told store must put mask on*. common US failed leadership.

I agree huge part it. u/undeleteparent US, one syllable ""word"" 1,000 (K, ""kay"").

""Thousand"" two syllables. sewer data unreliable: single test, positives preceding months following months, testing signs would show positive many different viruses. Actually 3% say opened immediately. 13% say open areas infection rates low (so assume, people certain states would allowed like people Northeast). No, I’m going waste time finding person doesn’t take seriously. 

Can find numbers?

The answer no, can’t, don’t publish many people symptoms. dozens interviews health professionals including Fauci talk exact symptoms common much risk pose. even wear mask outside? 0 days? Virginia vast majority shout masks unconstitutional complain people left unemployed result making much unemployment. need re-education system 19% false Canadians Asian countries wearing masks decades. Thanks Lol gonna die Anyone ever surprised all. Connecticut still hit miss comparing kids cages border concentration over-exaggerating things, kids food metal blankets.

When cornavirus hits required wear mask literal holocaust, pogrom rights, literal Nazi Germany modern world. state this? Thanks! research phone could find anything specifically asymptomatic transmission site. know there’s anything that? even public safety safety....Their mild inconvenience important safety. hell sense basic self-preservation?

You hear couple got fined recently claiming going self-isolate instead restaurants touring around?

Same Americans Washington travel Vancouver claiming they're passing way Alaska. lie get vacation risk infecting Canadians. Meanwhile, Canadians actually care collectively smashing pandemic, Americans fucking self-centered want want, live life normal.

Deaths 35,000 higher, year year, end May? That’s messed up. hearing Doctors Nurses situation? False negative shit, false positive covid-19... everything balance sewage. I'm States changed behavior since early March. gone stores socialize. get groceries essentials delivered. live alone leave house walk jog sit park (far away people). talk family friends phone regularly see anyone person. live apt. building shared laundry room. laundry middle night run neighbors. I'm extreme people I'm willing stay safe. I'm expecting life another year I'm hoping vaccine summer 2021. no, I'm numb it, all. buy week two tops hidden case growth due avoiding testing?

Buys week come another lie move annoying goal post again. could properly use social distancing masks would able hold bay vaccine. seen Florida? happening.  say counting mad China. Hospital CT well 25k tests month 1% positive confirm, alot morons country... (including commander chief...) Also, don’t date outside race. specifically date white men. rates dating black Hispanic insanely low. No, can't possibly bulled joke US right? US much money control. access medical care, money fund that, all. Nooooo... Recall guy. menace society. You:

Hospitals lied Covid19 close surgery rooms
Hospitals needed money close surgery rooms
Hospitals lied Covid19 get money

That's logic

Also, close friend nurse, verge PTSD induced breakdown due disease claim made up. Personally think there's special place hell people like lie slander people working death keep safe healthy. American agree say entire countries ravaged ain't flu One right here.

Should focused efforts elderly/nursing homes allowed young healthy people continue social distancing masks. Could avoided huge damage due economic collapse still kept vulnerable population protected. oh, monetizable. low blood ox problem, covid not.it could indicator declining lung function.

Apple Watches may soon detect blood oxygen already [FDA approval heart heart rate alert, heart rhythm detection, personal electrocardiogram (ECG) monitor.

the hardware capable, ios14 could enable it. Bequeathed China Russia. theoretically possible I'm aware confirmed cases actually happening. Either way risk far, far lower. math way off. 2% death rate, 117 deaths would equate 5,850 cases. it’s 5% death rate (since Arizona lot retirees) would mean 2,340 cases. Yo I'm American wholeheartedly agree. Keep frosty butts side we'll keep problem starting asses ours. safe best luck!! course 'absolutely nothing'. way anything Sheriffs police officers general say ""We going enforce orders! Period!"" 60% cases three states only. Rest country better state. reason, see negatives increase ratio. case. agree except wishing didn’t feel way. don’t mind do. I’m really sick ... well, don’t want comment evaporate, that’s all. might work place! surrounded crap day also. Luckily one person like 20 normal believes science facts. What's worse work hospital!! 😡 mean guy started football league, provide health insurance players give shit rest talent? I'm SHOCKED!!! Darwin Award here. mean 19% us fucking stupid?

I deeply ashamed. one that? Nope! 50% people Connecticut wearing masks according various surveys. issue people physical distancing much better treatments even father mother hospital May.

In fact realizing ventilators cause harm CoVid-19 patients putting ventilators unless direly need Maryland. seems like lot people half-assing guidelines. 

Today, went pet store first time year one employee mask around chin, manager wearing cutesy dog-print bandana nothing another employee wearing mask all. Another store sign door said masks required, enforcing it. say anything people clump closer SD markers checkout. 

My sister's workplace providing surgical masks face shields workers, company decided they'd give neck gaiter instead, like sell stores, call done. Two people mysteriously called-off work, (she found others they're getting tested Covid), business usual results come in.

We started going gym. gym resuming charging money there's lots advertisement care employees customers blah blah, saw lot glaring holes measures. staff provided adequate ppes. Frontdesk Girl wearing cowboy bandana. Everyone's required use disinfectant bottles wipe machines, hand sanitizer stations... everybody touches bottles. equipment, like ropes, can't wiped down. Every second machine closed off, makes four feet social distancing, six. People supposed even six feet away minutes, especially panting ones. there's dry sauna. still open. gym surprising busy next one besides staff wear masks. temperature checks, lot members young going asymptomatic. think we'll back awhile.

People done getting lazy, forgetting grandparents live here, businesses everything look CDC-compliant cutting every corner can. profound. find quote? Book Teenage Fathers Shit Brains. Interesting pressing friend, like many think fake covid deaths. thought least 30k. that’s 30K times families falsely told deceased covid. wouldn’t hard scheme unravel. One people worked years ago died early pandemic. close really, still hear voice see face think him. particularly old seem poor health dead same. Every. Single. Time. hear someone try deny pandemic want slap mouths shut memory. fucking people reason people dying still need sense slapped damn heads. hope never open email hear someone know died, worse, get phone call; may come back reality. feeling horrible thing ever experience. I've grandparents die terrible expected, family poor health well, lightning strikes hurt wish people would listen. Guess makes sense. Antibodies one piece body combating viruses.  also major financial interest profit schools... maybe small bias there. 19% morons. forget drink Clorox. relation another Nipah outbreak Kerala, blood serum samples bats collected affected areas turned negative health experts trying hard pinpoint main carriers virus.""

Nipah outbreaks occur also without fruit trees areas.

Evidence less outbreaks occur future? None. credible news source according Alexa Google SEO. Nothing words lot information. journalism degree teaches analysis credibility, expanding important topics. want bring facts, political bias. providing facts “121 frat kids positive”, enough. Unless want many test % testing aren’t showing double negative risk asymptomatic transmission virus drinking white claws fourth. 

This way can’t swayed, anything ideology. $$$$$$ U.S. citizen values Canadian lives, agree. live Evansville, Indiana. Population 120k.

For past 2 weeks added 20-30 cases day. huge majority people wear masks. flood local news social media insane shit I've ever seen. I've people laugh point wearing mask. 

Hell, tried hang black many Bloomington. 

Get Florida stay fuck away state. hotspot soon enough. 926 days 9th I'm gonna put note something work hard avoid, something aspire every blood clotting. guess oxygen deprivation extra steps. Watching anti mask protests Ontario making lose faith that.

Costco Canada mandate masks either, whereas US one does. Always thought weird think it'd hard figure one coworkers/employees called sick next two weeks got call contact tracer.

This highlight problem contact tracing, highlights problem employment US. Oh I’m well aware that! one reasons she’s debating coming. also use Synbicort also stocked around 10 pz March. think takes almost two months run feel pretty safe smoke nicotine pouches, low dose 3mg. drink beer, occasion. also excercise eat healthy. smoke drink automatically safe deadly disease? Good know. Whenever see refugees immigrants, always flip scenario head, imagine collapsing America ripped apart civil war, sort natural human-made disaster causes flee, might one side fence. 

I always really liked quote, ""those show mercy, expect none"". sure hope get shit order get path, collapse breakdown finally comes, think rest world's going much mood mercy, suspect ""but I'm like them"" going effective counter argument, especially end comes orgy political violence. 81% Canadians... right. BAH GAWD, THAT'S UNDERTAKER'S MUSIC! Rinse. Repeat. Recycle dumb.

So sad get manipulated screwed “pArTy PeOpLe!” thread parent talking Canada building wall making Mericans pay it. think? I’m three COVID-19 studies Stanford including one. 

We showed COVID-19 predictable / symptom onset using smartwatches ~80% people looked (we focused Fitbit first phase, small group high quality verifiable cases). focused heart rate normalized person’s baseline identify residual outliers, relationship heart rate steps. scaling (~5,500 currently enrolled) putting app warnings people’s phones see similar signals.

I’m also working micro-sampling approaches COVID-19 cases COVID-19 genetic risk scores. I’m medical doctor can’t give medical advice, done lot reading COVID-19 feel free ask questions. I’m US even think shouldn’t allowed anywhere GHB this? ask friends addicted GHB would fall asleep sudden seemingly nowhere stopped couldn’t get sleep easily months. One used marijuana ween GHB fall asleep still took two months recall. got point though sounded like you, would take Siri night, wake another cap go back sleep, never felt like good nights rest. Question friend China

Why ppl US especially governors still kinda 'cool' virus right now?
The consequence getting virus pretty severe ppl still partying dining like good , care loved one's life? governors, react miserably, get elected next time right?So acting like this?

Just mind boggling. Well, immediate they’re including parents children. siblings etc can’t come. absolutely love going movies. think theater probably thing miss this. But...yeah. I'm 90% sure last two times flu last cold came theater trips. flu hell back January know sure got older lady sat next me. Theaters pretty bad spreading shit even covid, there's way I'd go one right even though I'm scared hell favorite place going close it. fitting movie tropes right maybe this. Yeah, worked call centers large variety projects. Gret bad. currently getting $17/hr logg lunch breaks work home. team 21 people gotten 17 cases call back 3 months Spanish. speak spanish reps get $20/hr. I’m gonna level you: I’ve read 5-6 times still idea wtf comment trying say That’s fair.

My comment jab people accused US closing/controlling southern border supposed racism. Right isn’t works. 

No one knows I’m exposed. 

We don’t force people isolate. 

No one would know person got sick. one would know anything didn’t tell them. Malaysia population California, less 9000 cases TOTAL, 121 deaths total. never said would straight line 15 0. Given time, correct. Ahahahahahahaha! awesome, thanks! Close it. Definitely lacking impulse control obviously psychopaths zero empathy Thanks clarifying. Opened article see it.

Nope, that’s folks. Article might handful words longer title. debt? basically &lt;10 cases day state couple weeks ago. Sometimes there'd bad day NSW would 12 cases VIC would 14.

This explosion happened hotel quarantine outsourced budget providers, paid people shit money critical work. Surprise surprise, security guard minimum wage take job seriously contracted disease someone quarantining. Surprise surprise, HR manager enough staff as-is told get tested got sniffles.  That's they're labeling non-covid deaths covid. Funny rate death skyrockets that, huh. Nurses, PAs, NPs, doctors, health professionals immune political bullshit - fact, industry, know many part it. may know implement treatment take care patients, public health concerns override shitty religious political beliefs.

One colleagues going Florida next week. steering clear them. Wait, still thing US? Nope, Japan also hiding fudging numbers. pretty obvious since wanted host Olympics. Plus whole saving face culture. really want throw pie face ruin hair/makeup live TV. Gotta start someone, anyone, run opposed him.

Of course people constituency may agree 100% always case, made exceptions spring summer 2020 semesters obvious reasons. Nah sub byod. Yeah feel like everyone focuses lot “the kids (usually) fine” forget they’re super spreaders teachers, uh also families back workforce around tons others, that’s whole reason state pushing in-person school. okay. understand. logic ""bIG FiRm = baD"". literally imagine changing careers. way would setting foot classroom - I'm risk tolerant lot people! start earlier FL. We're talking beginning August.

The Northeast context, typically end August/ early September.

My nieces midwest also go back beginning August, there's one area this. dumbest people always somehow luckiest

Do Darwin Awards LARGE NUMBER type category? 

Or, whole species get nominated? generally feel way. back march noticing headaches slight fevers, might stress fatigue.

i got nasty something days back Feb....knowing know ( covid probably loose december) surprising got then. also really bad flu season....so....who knows?

just think good alive 2020 vs dark times human history. give reason move. Pick Australia, new Zealand Canada. treated respect, dignity, medical system fucked beyond belief. Nurses especially risk negligent way. trained diagnose - outside scope practice. see enough stuff work make feel confident. Incorrect. Quarantine orders simply can't “arbitrary, oppressive unreasonable”. state taken court quarantine judge capability end quarantine justified, states cities require court order judge's permission enact one. 

Fun fact: quarantine county quarantine Texas, would already permission county judge since head emergency management Texas law. Ready! completely wrong, unlucky! we’re using 2.74m infection number, probably orders magnitude, won’t take nearly long they’re suggesting. Lol. put much thought username. obviously understand insurance works. money pay liability. love take policy make pay out. That's incentives good behavior. Every week last three months? Go look Worldometers. Every Tuesday jumps counts weekend get processed. Wednesday usually highest week gradually drops weekend. cycle since late March/early April I’m surprised Villages hasn’t surges cases, places lot retired people skyrocketing Pinellas. I've seen bunch reddit obviously account posting meme.

The youtube account like 200 subscribers, videos hundreds thousands views. 

Whoever made either really glad monetized it, falls asleep thinking done that. Dock workers go strike, Asian goods enter America, feds capitulate 5 days. incorrect. think China washed money?

Also - read this: certainly spread via money passing credit cards stores, restaurants, etc.  also dog didn’t tickets. never heard that

 (off topic: 7/7 date japan started second sino-japanese war, considered important date) Please Lord, may never need go hospital Texas public advice. know Dad recent immigrant, last 50 years, sentiment much true immigrants families. Black immigrant family Caribbean sibling taught exact thing. 

I learned acknowledging community's treatment mean victim. lot Non-Black Americans, even Black immigrants, assume Black Americans admitting victimhood stating realities people history true. acknowledge something, share it, work dismantle it.

Also, lot immigrants believe idea ""pulling boothstraps. one that's ultimately control future."", mindset completely ignores much environment shapes opportunities outcomes. 

There play people succeed succeed beyond abilities. course, hard work determination make likely successful; but, two things alone make successful lot hard-working determined people still living poverty. guys comment history gave eyes cancer 

I feel sorry pathetic real life internet must Oh no! salespeople job must already! Perhaps earlier version covid they’ve cognitive impairment years. No, newest study points towards 5% hospitalisation. Still much. 20% first data ever released, missed tons cases dude said offends God

i forgot that. remember reading thinking whether he'd approve fig leaf reads like news heading Onion. Wish was... walked subway Orange county none employees wearing masks.

Jesus Christ... make list shame hell social media? 7 day rolling average best comparing increase 44% one day next absolutely atrocious. ok fly HK Canada? check anytime want, never leave. pretty much he's trying fuck US even gets voted coolcool Agreed!! Population density may factor much spreads definitely predictor. Look densely populated countries like South Korea, Japan, Singapore, Vietnam (a third world nation) able control spread virus. look densely populated areas world got hit hard beginning able bring infection rate following recommended guidelines like New York, Italy, France.

Now, virus spreading rampantly rural areas United States; including Alabama, Mississippi, Kansas, Tennessee, mainly rural countries like India. Density main factor. may contribute, reflect densely populated areas able control spread rural areas not.

Same thing heat. Florida Arizona hottest states US currently experiencing huge spikes infections middle summer northern states still controlling (somewhat) spread infection. non mask wears, tl:dr...wear damn mask short-term predictor future recorded deaths areas relatively stable reported CFR time. fundamentally though. think take long damn time lot unnecessary deaths reach herd immunity likely vaccine long that. talk deaths hospitalizations, like either.

Stop getting tested. Stop wearing masks (this dude said offends God) Stop going hospital can't breathe. Stop talking coronavirus, go back work, pay taxes, spend money prop economy, peons. Plus occasional student

Or risking giving life long health problems figures title. third deaths happened NYC. rookie numbers, Australia. fools even league Florida Arizona. every one positive cases infects hundred people, *maybe* start compete, would get work immediately make happen. I'm ok force necessary. flu unprecedented. would implore think outside myopic view.

It's completely incorrect. month ago!!!! know makes sense. I'm even saying malicious, states hard time grappling disease keep I'm confused excess mortality study date lines excess deaths Florida/Texas/Georgia tune.

No, mean miss 1 every 10 deaths, place 10,000 deaths give excess deaths place 1,000 deaths, even missing rate. see excess deaths places like Texas Florida deaths go way up. 

But even so, still seeing excess deaths places like example, New York City, all-cause deaths seven times higher baseline pandemic peak, 25,100 excess deaths, 26% attributed COVID-19. parts New York, excess deaths twice high baseline, 12,300 excess states high numbers excess deaths New Jersey, Massachusetts, Louisiana, Illinois, Michigan, excess deaths reported smaller central states northern New gap deaths attributed COVID-19 estimated number all-cause excess deaths also varied among states, California reporting 4,046 coronavirus deaths 6,800 excess deaths, leaving 41% excess deaths attributed gaps even wider Texas, 55% excess deaths classified due coronavirus, Arizona, 53% excess deaths attributed causes COVID-19.** Minnesota showed best agreement, 12% excess deaths unattributed COVID-19.

Note also part numbers better aligned time, large part due increased testing. Spicy post sub. Best wishes little Irish maid. We're pretending already case? org even still value kind? That's California Department Health... life simple. Hurricanes 2020: Hold categories 1-4 I'll give day two back again. Like South Park? hiding back there? extra infections coming then? Yep, 2% assumes severe ICU shortage, may really bad assumption. Unfortunately Florida best hide data past Raising Canes day. least 50 cars drive-thru. I’m wish well I’d rather party’s nominee someone seems like brain heart uses occasion opposed someone term “malicious sociopath” probably kind. understand seeing kind slow epicurve. FDA commissioner said diag. 1 20 cases moment leaves us 700,000 cases per day leaves almost everyone infected like 200 days already 140+ days in. Florida saying 1 100 COVID? seeing drop ? Party people went got sick recovered died, older pops thing. would ever guilt someone Amen Preeeetty sure you’re thinking China. way, eh! Take ya hosers! dumped eight corona quarantine discovered lot new found personal time. people schools employ left dry? Subhumans. Definitely. coerce schools reopening in-person.

That day guy white house posted online ""COLLEGES MUST REOPEN!"" Neither I.

This virus clearly negative psychological impact many people. mention Vancouver, Canada's densest city. Excuse language fuck them. Mask ordinances fines Tuscaloosa Birmingham. much step right direction. wish.

Im northeast... normally visit Florida winter months. I’ve FL “summer” and...nope. (But I’m also white snowflake lol) frank, anecdotal course understand that, would surprised local hospital system mere days away running crucial supplies. 

Their PCR testing abysmal, probably first time adult life I'm thanking god private sector assholes plenty tests every day week far. 

These hospitals even keep hand sanitizer hand. least two three staff members charged stealing supplies, including N95's face shields.

This entire state dumpster fire.  can't help wonder people paid Trump shills spreading current talking points. tell people get vaccine (provided found effective), they:

- longer wear mask,
- longer social distance,
- live normal life again.

I'm sure even anti-vaxxers give in. 

There probably kind special hard forge ID says bearer got vaccine. Maybe states roll normal driver license/ID. Deaths reported anytime due backlog could reported today, that's fact. idea many, know every death reported today happened last 24 hours. Lower covid deathrate? miss something? Still estimated &lt;1% way 3% no?

Was march, professionals think around 1-2% think. Probably close 10%. Says 77,000 employees, probably indirectly employed another 40-60,000. 

However bet people don’t live Orlando commute due prices. It’s impossible tell real percentage. also dropping album soon. No, Floridians really evacuate hurricanes unless they're flood zones. toss debris place cause extensive property damage, long stay indoors storm (like 6-12 hours) hurt you. Ya doubt study included USA absolutely nothing stop though. India atleast trying, given work bad job. Start saving. cant afford doesnt mean possible future! Bruh feel you. helping brother move stuff one apartment another apartment couple weeks ago hell. once, can't imagine weeks months end. workers either tourists jobs

It’s real dilemma places. US needs, brain damaged people numbers meant population US. district district said like 50% wanted distance option. gave us surveys published results. Give family Darwin Award! Older people reacting pandemic expected

""...elderly people willing isolate asked, compliant preventative measures hand washing mask wearing"" 

No shit, Sherlock. Donna forgot Facebook password (3rd time 6 months) PISSED ATT store isnt immediately available fix her. would've asked grandson also sick shit. dare asked wear mask inside small store people inside it? freedoms, know."" 

But serious note, child abuse factor heartwrenching. friends family pussies. definitely isn’t political. Yes, US quits China's donation becomes biggest contribution WHO. Oh wait happening right now. 8 weeks next holiday, lets see happens Labor Day. text would work better catch someone answer phone. Trump runs CDC.

If gets vaccine Oct virus somehow go away probably win.

No way Trump wins things bad today. need stop worrying end date set exit metrics instead. ..via 3 million deaths occurred yesterday reported today? lag death reporting? really give new info. many potential vaccines hundreds meds tested. upvoted, major development.

These parents killed child. It’s myopic least.Teachers die get sick weak language guidelines. That’s fact.

Redcaps really think people fall this? keep seeing posted anyone 2 brain cells realize there's correlation protests happened outbreaks occurring. he'd still full shit. sheer amount healthcare bills simply go unpaid mind-boggling. 

I personally know guy paying several thousand dollars ER bills $20/month...it keeps account going collection. 

I personally know people straight never pay all, simply open bills, answer unknown calls, dodge shit years. true, can't believe happened US....

I felt angry sad especially hydroxychloroquine part, really hope whole news fake news... sad seen saying economy great though paper, that's true, practically, identity person actually matter.

Most states require electors vote according popular vote state. Supreme Court recently ruled states legally punish electors job wrong. mention Remdesivir likely reducing hospitals stays, improving outcomes, reducing mortality based [multi-center, placebo controlled double-blind trail results published looks like 121k patients would treated first batch shipments. I’d imagine actually may provide meaningful improvement overall numbers nationally given that’s large proportion total hospitalizations time period.

Reduced ventilator usage also big deal. overeager put patients ventilators 10-20% put ventilators ultimately saved, may similar greater number would survive treatments, whole ventilators may keep ultimately die despite ICUs 2-6 weeks requiring enormous amount care resources.

Ie, we’re helping people recover quickly time better treatments, seems might better understanding ventilators may prolonging inevitable outcome worsening odds many patients soaking ICU many weeks ICU capacity resources desperately need keep case load. OK, get people like friend is, forced, 'forced,' stay inside extrovert, agonizing frustrating whatnot, would *want* good cause hoax something even true. 

That's guess though. Thanks looking stat.

Something people keep mind hospitals equal. we've seen, virus typically hits urban areas harder first trickles rural ones. full hospitals probably among biggest, staffed, best equipped prepared, etc. lot ones near ICU capacity probably small rural hospitals maybe 3-5 ICU beds. proven cause? check blood-oxygen levels daily, would least little comforting know I'm probably going anything complications asymptomatic infection without least little warning. China CCP fighting like hell muddy waters. China fighting wars lot fronts days.. chances see elective surgeries shut save PPE? Asking friend. American. fully support them! get pour water American. fully support them! sub like day 1. Spent quarantine completing alt certification switch teaching career.

This news making excited. /s Florida reports new daily hospitalizations cumulative numbers, many currently hospitalized. said would release data soon, done yet. full shit genuinely confusing.

Insurance providers definitely love ICU stays. pocket maximums met quickly ICU insurance company left holding bag. goes major illness injury.

There's reason car insurance goes car modern safety features. There's reason workplace health insurance plan's premiums stay go provide wellness workshops, smoking-cessation resources, etc.

What fuck ""bankruptcy company?""

Your lender(s) would actually also prefer stay healthy employed. Selling foreclosed home repossessing car preferred method making money...

Why back 2's day two, back 6's couple days, another spike day 9's week? Interesting sure. Deja vu sure. What’s quote study history doomed repeat it? one ever considers also applies recent past. Alas, are. study history *in denial* current events 🤦🏻‍♀️ Idk getting downvoted. Chinas reporting comical like Russian Checkers board seem like good guy, promise one thing. we're roaming countryside drinking blood human skulls wearing armor made entirely spikes, we'll wearing masks least. expand actually applied received benefits three weeks pay back made much reported little.

What’s percentage people show increase? level fitness play confounding role? COVID flu!

COVID flu!

COVID flu! Yep, basically taught growing up. Violent racism course reported authorities possible, racist insults, jokes, jeers, etc, told ignore work hard. “Just ignore words can’t hurt you. One day you’ll rich successful, they’ll working you/homeless/shot police/etc”. Jesse Ventura tried start wrestlers' union 80s Hulk Hogan ratted Vince. would nice. I’m stuck quarantining room COVID-19 POSITIVE sister law, two kids husband run around entire house touching everything. 

They room quarantining trying stop spread 8 member household. ICUs filling south California. numbers gonna jump. lot. say “yeah no” blatant fact? literally sums r/coronavirus actually simple reason inferring. suppose next 4 days lower death numbers since March, keeping pattern, oh say 5-6 days another 900+ day reported? Come crabs, stay 'rona. Darker skin lower vitamin lowered immunity, probably. John Campbell beating drum months never see mentioned anywhere regarding POC could severely affected this. Happy Cake Day nothing done?

Sweden many things plan. way virus spread care homes big failure part plan. read yesterday Florida 14,000 hospitalised now, number come from? remember link.  agenda killing population seems. guy Titanic trying bribe spot escape boats. Stop referring human beings herd animals. think get rid Republicans Democrats round. 

At point looking best bet. wear masks public spaces, complain them. see that's wrong. edited comment info. generations WW2 we're losing. Badly. We're like Poland. actually 2/3 weeks 4/6.  
The aggravation usually one week apparition symptoms. begin usually five days infection (not 14, read people know quarantine is). Add days go aggravation death. death daughter change fact I'm American think should. amount people gathering partying ridiculous get called boring one going weeks ago, state allowing cities set public health policies. wasn’t cases started exploding gov allowed cities make masks mandatory, even it’s statewide. blame governor. can't blame fatal ignorance going States. miss go TO. though. asking question hate? Yes seems like airborne like measles TB would much much transmissible, would see spreading faster. 

No? Watered highballs titties essential round parts. whrn icus hit capacity death rates go 10%  That's pretty much ""everyone people know"". that's great book. read long enough ago remember part though Really nothing important do? antibody story new. read months ago. reply cant internet. get rid them. cares seen afar, really America, ""just"" South Southwest. Understood, however there’s little excuse travelling around RV. clearly tourists abusing travel ban. quick praise lol

Did notice intense homophobia driving another Covid 😷? see, Norway, discovered oil, invested sort ""National Savings Account"" every subject kingdom; none shall withdraw it, revenue Sovereign Wealth cannot go things like arms development, etc; bet use revenue Norwegians fall hard times like nowadays, they're going depend something never come people blame circumstances. Bullshit. Covid-19 spreads easier overcrowded households sure nothing smoking everything overcrowded households. reap sow. lead horse water. can't make drink water. guy would give daily updates Faroes daily thread, I'm glad area well. lessons learned. cdc said masks don’t help? bone chilling read. else going do?

I firsthand anecdotes experience switching Zoom, every child going access computer every child going supportive parents help it. Working parents want leave young easily-distracted kids alone home. there's kids neglected abused without adults check-in them. 

I think best supply schools masks make sure everyone them, make mandatory wear them. days might longer cafeteria lines tables socially distanced everybody still gets enough time eat. handsanitizer stations. Hire teachers, possible, class sizes small. Increase wages teachers incentivize them.

I think lot people going move homeschooling/ FL Virtual School anyway. Well, Muslim China, refuse pay rent. landlord call police, cops likely ask *the landlord* compensate *you* 60,000 yuan (\~$10,000), still need pay rent pasting years.

Of course second choice, simply destroy police office, get paid police satisfy you. Looking trends data. Today 993 deaths counted. higher number holiday weekend. Tomorrow I’m predicting large decline deaths trend continue around 350 nationwide wide covid deaths couple weeks. trying let many die possible?! It’s criminal.. hope teachers strike something . turning little kids superspreaders .. nothing wins election like sacrifice children. evil . Leaving Florida one best decisions clearly . I'm Nelson BC. I've never seen tourists town, absolutely everywhere. people hate live much, can't wait months see happens shit? going anywhere year find idea easy comforting. American, glad closed border.  one needs get sick b/c us.  know Americans crazy! one ""sit down"" restaurant town open full capacity again(phase 3 happened Virginia). literally billboard way town saying ""we're open, masks optional"" yet masks supposed mandatory Virginia.

An acquaintance mine server there. constantly posting photos without masks on, wears one work....when isnt taking selfies posting back mask pulled down.

This clusterfuck. number deaths numbers rising again, expected. increase deaths happening now, due increase people got infected around 24 June. 

The increase Deaths always lags behind new cases 2-3 weeks. 2-3 now, probably going see around 2000 daily deaths. Luckily say never fan WWE WWF 8D People keep talking declining mortality rate;

They are? seem declining. Unless think lower CFR means lower IFR. Word true, deep administration trying push blame incompetent response epidemic another organization. made mistakes beginning, administration incompetent 6 months epidemic. PA teachers’ unions anywhere near strong decade ago mom left profession, schools won’t starting fall.

At minimum, must concerned effects teachers getting infected en masse future health insurance premiums.

My mom said school air conditioned, since closed modern schools are.... they’re saying spread might exacerbated AC systems recirculating air, wouldn’t surprised that....

You really think you’re going get age group kids wear masks day long? will, yes, maybe even most. think special education teachers going able keep masks kids autism extreme ADHD? chance. kids putting every teacher student school risk. parents eager send kids back, number reasons. don’t blame them, it’s going absolute shit show. Mark words. know living alternate dimension entire life insurance company provider...  someone U.S good thinking guys. leadership awful drowning. Save Please thank seems munchausen proxy  Well hope gets full body blood clots loses legs American agree. suffer beyond incompetent leadership. trend upwards, look  yet numbers consistently going down.  100k people could die tomorrow 1 million people could get infected would still trying whittle away numbers pedantics, technicalities bullshit prove things bad people saying completely batshit crazy reason. already hear ""It time.

Get N95s KN95s face shield. local pharmacy may able help you. supplies tightening up. r/holup Hope well. consider taking extra precautions well, even test negative could false negative. Yeah stupid comments that. Ngl sounds something plague inc would say It’s finger pointing. It’s adding context. Swedes know Swedish health care lot improve neglected decades. crisis amplify whole problem. 

Further seems similar problems nursing homes world. Like example. Also [Spain. google find cases. different. people asthma lifes careful lives every cold flu bring, people (myself included) always bring, asthma attacks it. 

Every year, sometimes once, reminded problem cold flu are.

That happen diabetes hypertension, people actively avoid stuff, people. even warnings people aware public seen ""it affects lungs"".

I'm saying diseases dangerous virus respiratory diseases, believe aware problem others. Victoria? Dental back normal state great need new crown implicit assumption every country started base level health policy explain trajectories virus, think true all.

Yes, totally agree points. goes discussions economical recovery. many factors even different Nordic countries lead different recoveries, Norway never really stood big chance oil price slump pandemic, despite well handled health-care-crisis. people said: ""But DK, economically much better"" (Disclaimer: level)?  
Yeah, Sweden society international also industry export orientation. extremely slow putting even basic measurements 

And important visitor ban care homes.... Na disagreed therefore = conservative simple logic /s still MAKE money. still BENEFIT get sick go ICU. safe manner. 

Meaning exactly? safe plans returning students? Pretending virus gone throwing open doors like usual unsafe dangerous whole system collapse weeks plan. Basically nothing. Bandying around herd immunity dangerous nonsense. America shithole country... That's neat. /r/glasses Brit who's spent fair amount time, US commercials properly baffle me. can't explain they're cheesy incredibly direct. surprise slightest army adverts likened Call Duty.

It’s possible since [ACE-2 brain virus attach run it’s course. death probably school related

There little happening college campuses right  wasn’t real democracy, that’s greatest trick American politics, 2 party system lobbyists, media driven corporate entities fund 2 party system. It’s democracy. 300+ million peoples’ political views can’t separated red team blue team. century blindly supporting political system designed give illusion control. Bye bye America, please don’t take us Note said top levels. Let guys next levels get chance move ladder...if chance Congressional level go back state level experienced people, many deserve chance help country line pockets.

I say add term limits state level below, top. there's people experience leading states step help lead country...and take turns. lifetime job, especially shitty ones. they're in, getting rid harder getting rid bad cop. Masks. forgot masks. took away civil rights 3,000 dead. constantly predicting doom gloom scenarios

Prepare worst, hope best logical way approach things, sad many doomers. 🖖😷

No, protesting didn’t much effect. economy needs able handle pandemics, inevitable more. something like universal basic income place lockdown would totally different caused nearly much economic damage, least people wouldn’t work recklessly feed shelter. According local news site, 41 infected close contacts previous infected individuals, rest community spread. Test positive rate also something 4%. Neighbouring area Saitama 48 new infections today.

Not good... Judging comment history *exactly* you’re doing.

You ashamed yourself. American shithole Hey, America, keep ignoring science. 

You’ll let detained families fill jobs left vacant *proudboys* sense huge influx ""I know!"" criers kids really start getting sick. It'll harsh blame goes anyone dumb enough send kids back. we're hurting dumb adults kids country. wouldn't. teachers staff though forced choose, safety health job though. imagine many panic right thinking fall. Asians among first take things seriously one things (besides media political coverage) made us stand out, reinforcing minds public “Asian” disease. you’re ones wearing masks, people don’t assume it’s you’re safe considerate others, assume it’s you’re sick. Statistics say otherwise School districts ultilmate example local control interesting G P suddenly interested centralized control. Every district different hybrid models make sense. parent high schooler middle schooler favored plan would school 2-3 days week emphasis math specials like band (if make work) art tech ed classes. experience far virtual learning social studies, science, english language arts went okay online. Possibly. depends countries decide trust us again, knowing America always 4 years away going full stupid. showed rest world elect reality star political experience White House. Kind hard want make long-term agreements country like that.  Kind depends careful are, planning small ceremony entirely outdoors distancing masking place, considering everyone's safety concerns plans, would consider it. indoor ceremony without incorporating guests' safety wishes planning, definitely go, people take kind risks likely taking kinds risks well, anyone choose attend would significantly likely infectious average. Take care. Yes. American Pediatric Association said kids need go back school safe manner. Two working parents cannot replace teachers, kids already sacrificed months schooling. Distance learning work little kids socialization important. ideal. states months figure way safely open listening science well. BJ's really good doe. prime rib juicy even coronavirus. wives family Australian idea dont live there. explaining paying ambulances medical system confusing them. big jump deaths claim true? that's money works end hyperinflation resulting death toll economic collapse make Covid look like 24 hour bug. think talking Sweden though profit part makes fucked up.

Canada aint perfect holy fuck. people still vehemently denying danger covid-19 Unfortunately, union strong used be; also meaning heath insurance good used high deductibles. Agreed getting students wear masks struggle; work special education, right, getting severe disabilities going almost impossible. work building originally designed school ventilation issue years; matter much complain building owner doesn’t seem issue it. a/c could definitely spread it: look mold issue PA last year put openings 1-2 weeks schools. know parents want kids go back, kids want go back; hell, even want go back traditional schooling building. 

With money schools saved due heating/cooling costs, sports expenses, janitorial costs, substitute pay (and I’m sure I’m considering moment), don’t see schools don’t cyber point. guess federal government force states going back offering money incentive - ultimate motivator. I’m hoping governor keeps level head leaves individual districts keeping us out. heard DeSantis say every two weeks baffled boasting LTC plan. y'all text instead? literally answer phonecalls voicemail full probably 7-8 years, design Antibodies stored away form memory remade fight infection needed. Paraphrased version comment article probably referencing? read Reddit least Sad true. Probably health care administrators would even accurate. They're one bloated tumors medical system, along insurance companies.  can't trust system. New deaths appear around 10-20 days new cases won‘t they? Wait winter beds filled snow ground (at least I'm normally get snow winter). Anthony Fauci trying avoid one seems grasp that. Winter going dark, like said keep taking seriously. said Southern Hemisphere general risk. argument us well hit summer winter cases would start popping up. point NZ Southern Hemisphere deep winter without single case months, proves argument incorrect. Hong Kong, arrive take test center put hotel, negative call within next morning go home still quarantine another 14 days. Black guy pointing head: can't hit second wave never deal first wave. Ok one don’t see new jobs brought back overseas. h1b fizzed air would prevented jobs continuing taken away us. Trump continuously runs ads Biden bed China yet one asked president help winning election. Tax breaks? Yo7 call 2% decent break cost living 3% per year? Meanwhile large corps getting biggest benefit still laying people. steel jobs? Last time checked iPhone still built China. Nothing changed stock market rigged tank. economy poorly right yet somehow everything ok? Maybe it’s pump dump happening can’t see it. rarely value informed; makes little sense.

It's much valuing informed. One could almost understand seeking information knowledge highly valued.

It's active pushback informed, drive ridicule facts, knowledge information. That, me, truly mindboggling. politicians go. **If replacements turn bad**, we'll cross bridge come it.

We're trying cross bridge right now, closed. Instead arrest change American police national pastime shooting suspects. Agreed accounts. truly believe fake. Look good, long time. Notice anything?

Why don’t see feet? 

Because feet sand would difficult photoshop convincingly, especially many different pictures.

The people whose feet we’d possibly able see positioned perfect way can’t see them? buying it. Period. One big defences for-profit healthcare so-called innovation. Would nice University country universal healthcare came vaccine. Might also mean Americans afford it! ideal world countries would follow suite could reevaluate reorganize better leadership. Sadly, many countries addicted sucking China's dick anything.

Disney World Florida says hi bring whole family y'all! (COUGH) I'm sad people careful America. willful ignorance half country means 0 sympathy people families. They've risked people's lives families, care get now. Yep, I'm sure he's wrong reasons (because he's fucking moron) - totally agree end result. Daffy Duck legitimacy COVID does. Complete clowns. Wonder fill power vacuum... think Sweden ""success"" either, amount coverage Sweden disproportional failure opinion. international press also incredibly shallow. [Sweden similar excess death percentage increase less than, Netherlands, Switzerland, Belgium, UK, Italy articles focus Sweden compared neighbors implying Nordic started place abilities fight virus spread. really true. Sweden extremely decentralized health system, much levels housing overcrowding (15% Sweden, 9.2% Denmark, 7.3% Finland, 6% Norway), probably international connections like 20% population foreign, lack preparedness dates back like 30 years ago, one countries highest rates international travel, spring break Stockholm happening week virus spread known, etc. 

There implicit assumption every country started base level health policy explain trajectories virus, think true all. sucks... Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Turns model shit. 

As many trying tell you. FUD, sweden reached herd immunity may! Nope, first ""P"" PPE stands ""Personal"". 'Murica great yet? Taiwan Korea also aggressively tested isolated infected people, even symptoms. It’s masks.

In US don’t even bother test someone unless symptoms idea virus people start getting ill can’t get control. swedens imigrant areas hit hardest another culture. visited sick brought food family. Sure, would help people sick, put bag groceries door walk away.
They also often alot people per apartment. Well least whales catch virus.

Is article real though? blame wearing masks, blame corporations mishandling processing waste. Biggest one day record *for California*? straight biggest? what's going end naturally lot people's lives. 100,000 ICU beds going stretch far guys get deep millions. Sweden still extremely high death tolls compared neighbors disregard deaths elderly care homes (even without disregarding neighboring countries)

Looking like sheep's buys everything government tells them.
Sweden... I'm surprised mask usage mask pole mask removal match done storylined. Seems like totally good shit Vince would laugh ass at. you’re gonna cry study based 43 people ages 19-85 may may coronavirus? ICU ER two different things way. waiting test results need stuck ER perfect health, definitely ICU. Virus, *^gestures ^vaguely* this? power geographically dispersed countries right next other. tables turned onto people US saying “go back country” immigrants people color.. it’s countries saying “stay damn country” highly doubt we'll ever break records set NYC area, time tell.. 20% clearly idiots highest growth cases, too... I’m American, GTFO moved Toronto Mathematician here. No, all. 

In case, datasets show exponential growth deaths drowned majority (yet). That's paradox - that's would expect happen.

Simpson's Paradox almost data sets show one conclusion, combined data set shows another. example, imagine better every class, got higher grade point average.  (Actually, can't happen rational grade point average calculation, sort idea.) Nope...

I'm going assume also American, gen-z, yes? going shit-talk democratic republic prejudice toward homophobia (likely variant single news article read upon Google search).

Listen, US fortunate progressive social rights comparison contries. Unfortunately, democracy also subject change. currently/consistently threat. So...

One: need get ass vote (mail-in, yeah?).

And Two:

Understand less three decades ago US, someone would beaten death street gay would cared.

Think that. Think. About. That.

Also, think US treating people color -less white citizens centuries, literally centuries. 

Also, think US treating women -less male citizens, centuries, again, literally centuries.

Also, think US treating transgender individuals less human, again, centuries.

Think talk shit allies. 

Humans rights progression, certainly podium preach it. Certainly moment. actors really dedicated buried cremated alive.

I'm dying. reduced mortality due ""lockdown"" region sweden. Went 50 death normal 37. 37 included 13 died corona. Well fair better treating using anti bodies methods. kill old farts retired. young ones underlying conditions get smorgasbord new underlying conditions population places live since killed old people. 

Win win 

/s Good thing matter 100% anyone thinks. 2 weeks. I'm MA, consistently 100-300 new cases 50 deaths per day month now. worst April, started trying gyms movie theaters, etc. start opening yesterday. still think mistakes, also said churches restaurants seen spike yet. 

What I'm saying is, think Newsome really fucked guys, path us northeast. Now, worse ever were, late. go lockdown much longer period now. guy able replicate results..... talking Alberta knowing hell they're doing, right. Shit's bit fucky right now. supposed masks + social distancing + non essentials lockdown 

Sadly people seem think masks = full immunity Twilight Zone. Marvel Universe number screwed... Look numbers country wide. never anything number country. It’s climbing. 

It’s like north east majority start. 2nd 3rd wave first one pass. never did. 

This still first wave. Storms liberal hoax. refer Asians, thought it’s clear also encompasses Asian-Americans. Don’t think second Asian-Americans country facing exact stereotyping racial prejudice African Americans are. targeted police like African-Americans, it’s targeted nationalities “responsible”for Covid. already escalated unprovoked violence Asian-Americans Philadelphia. end day, doesn’t matter born US.  look Asian, never seen “American” people nationalities still see “Chinese”. officially 20k infections per day really many times testing capacity uncover them. oh, kim, thought country virus... That's works, unless weekend 7 days long. Sweden one hardest hit countries world. far fine regardless brainwashed population led believe state media. Also, overcrowding (many recent immigrants live really poor housing conditions), worse access information (if speak local language well, miss lots details) and, since leverage, quite possibly abusive employers. Yeah think guys stupid ones. know virus isn’t going anywhere right? Herd immunity needs happen. realize this? Feel bad man remaining 19% missed poll. charged. trust people charge idea gone. many conflicting statements, outright lies.

They removed measures order hold elections, trying reintroduce them, way blaming people irresponsible.

I even judge believe virus all. official statements go by, either. Luckily Reddit, unfortunately trustworthy (am really calling Reddit trustworthy) Covid news source right now. right, end would distancing masks forever.

Abstract
Preliminary clinical data indicate severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection associated neurological neuropsychiatric illness. Responding this, weekly virtual coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) neurology multi-disciplinary meeting established National Hospital, Queen Square, early March 2020 order discuss begin understand neurological presentations patients suspected COVID-19-related neurological disorders. Detailed clinical paraclinical data collected cases diagnosis COVID-19 confirmed RNA PCR, diagnosis probable/possible according World Health Organization criteria. 43 patients, 29 SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive definite, eight probable six possible. Five major categories emerged: (i) encephalopathies (n = 10) delirium/psychosis distinct MRI CSF abnormalities, 9/10 making full partial recovery supportive care only; (ii) inflammatory CNS syndromes (n = 12) including encephalitis (n = 2, para- post-infectious), acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (n = 9), haemorrhage five, necrosis one, myelitis two, isolated myelitis (n = 1). these, 10 treated corticosteroids, three patients also received intravenous immunoglobulin; one made full recovery, 10 12 made partial recovery, one patient died; (iii) ischaemic strokes (n = 8) associated pro-thrombotic state (four pulmonary thromboembolism), one died; (iv) peripheral neurological disorders (n = 8), seven Guillain-Barré syndrome, one brachial plexopathy, six eight making partial ongoing recovery; (v) five patients miscellaneous central disorders fit categories. SARS-CoV-2 infection associated wide spectrum neurological syndromes affecting whole neuraxis, including cerebral vasculature and, cases, responding immunotherapies. high incidence acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, particularly haemorrhagic change, striking. complication related severity respiratory COVID-19 disease. Early recognition, investigation management COVID-19-related neurological disease challenging. clinical, neuroradiological, biomarker neuropathological studies essential determine underlying pathobiological mechanisms, guide treatment. Longitudinal follow-up studies necessary ascertain long-term neurological neuropsychological consequences pandemic. Racism ... vitamin D? Deaths going back up. knows next talking point averaging 1500 deaths day again. lot foreign students athletes came scholarships getting tuition deferred, though. I’d pay see Florida man, Florida can. love people America, individual level, always found politics stark classism bat shit insane. idea health care guaranteed, poverty rampant apparent every time there. really hope y'all figure way this. anything, guys resilient stubborn. Nice Maybe a) can't afford stop working b) limited access healthcare

actual causes blaming Ok, I'm going first ask question: anybody think world leader wear mask, exposed covid several times whose entire reaction pandemic seems ""Go virus!""?

Just asking. mean Arizona? fear mongering American here. I’m even sure anymore. always vote. I’ve pressuring everyone know same. even Biden wins Trump doesn’t declare emergency powers forego election, who’s say he’ll leave? regular citizen, doesn’t even feel like there’s anything it.

Most us didn’t ask this. us don’t want this. us never wanted this. we’re trapped hotspot virus could kill us (and already killed many people).

What supposed do? Haha, see want see.

Destruction texts books disgusting. Tiananmen square horrible senseless massacre. Camps Uighers shame.

I'm angry you, I'm Chinese. None things got anything number coronavirus cases China right now. Unless got anything show numbers wrong I'd suggest try stay topic. count cases China separately:
- China
- Asia outside China
- Europe
- Africa
- America
- Australia ( means Oceania? )

So 0 cases imported China last week. possible Australia counting cases. Even still test asymptomatic people. first months almost impossible tested unless direct connection Wuhan. great. Thank  Yeah really make sense. Considering antibodies stay immune system while. bet go get one place really wanted see. get three sure good luck mean probably true. count comorbid deaths too? remember reading somewhere didn't. also, countries got affected early on, Germany little late. given almost 5 times icu beds Italy, surprising able handle peak better. Maybe stop reading tabloids confusing news. Chill Brett loll Sweden's economy one world grew instead shrinking last quarter never intended halt eliminate virus, assuming curve would never overstretch hospitals (and assumed correctly).

So yeah, safe say article/opinion piece bunk. mean already bent let government stick patriot act civil right’s ass name national security. What’s difference here? *dare* suggest doesn’t plan place? Two words: paper. towels. plan launch T-Shirt launcher position near top Disney Castle. always, Trump basically every ""thank service"" politician shows exactly much care soldiers Learned Broen amazing show Pack boys, control. Hogan went Johns Hopkins, tangerine twit support league. sensible member party keeps looney element mutter. Plus, Hogan put mask orders right around Easter, know chanting ""sacrifice old economy!"" extremely important point out. Give pat back. Disneyworld still re-opening days, full. Gamblers probably least likely group care Covid. may scale back restaurants gambling remain open. True border closure stopping 8000 Americans tried come across last couple weeks. bunch get across, getting reported border security care, yo. one trying get canada American, hope stay closed. give fire fuel. Calling animals dehumanizing pretend like circumstances. 
All humans hella smart, hairless apes. feel like numbers wrong.

Covid causes pneumonia, pneumonia-like symptoms.

Strangely enough, look average number deaths pneumonia past years, year seen thousands thousands pneumonia deaths usual.

Is possible, even likely, lot way-above-normal pneumonia deaths actually COVID deaths, categorised such?

I think people think extremely likely.

So think particular factoid round wrong way, whether rest say makes sense. bet that's people thought chicken pox surprised developed shingles later life. Can’t waste time explaining every dumm dumm obvious things work Swedens case work sorry... try google. Yeah. corona control.

Figure open again. get Covid-19. Well done, America! Still think hysteria? I'd surprised still shit February 2022, degree. doom doom doom Article crap. Starts describing things wave 2. never left wave 1. post removed cannot verify reliable source. Twitter sources may reliable. possible, please re-submit link reliable source (i.e. news article).

Yeah dont think people realize bad got NY. Honestly, think mainly people fixated confirmed cases counts. time NY getting hit, testing capacity US really low capturing tiny proportion true infected people, mainly focusing high risk. mean, peak, seeing 50% tests come back positive. running like 20k tests per day 10k coming back positive, absolutely insane. Compare Florida getting hit hard right now, averaging like 45k tests per day 9k positive 20% positive rate. people see 9k confirmed cases Florida think comparable 10k NY seeing, doesnt account testing capacity. NY running 45k tests instead 20k, bet would gotten like 18-20k positive results instead 10k. even right now, places like Florida really comparable NY (yet). may change governors states keep acting like buffoons people keep acting like pandemic happening.

You’re right, pandemic represents real test people’s ability critically interpret information. “I don’t know anyone...” exactly I’m talking about. experience bad outcome personally believe scientists world health leaders? don’t know anyone who’s died car accident still believe them. don’t know anyone died civil war still believe happened.

#""They turned expectations public without finding possible do,"" says Tina Dahlman, elected representative Medical Association Dalarna.

In Stockholm Västra Götaland, since beginning June, public able test whether ongoing covid infection. Sampling offered symptoms covid-19 regions: Uppsala, Västmanland, Västerbotten, Örebro, Östergötland, Kalmar, Gävleborg Gotland, recently decided offer sampling mild symptoms. done either self-test health centers. Dalarna, samples taken health centers analyzed clinical microbiology Falun.

- Although analysis capacity means unlimited, assessment high enough able offer everyone suspected symptoms free charge, says Roger Larsson, chief physician Dalarna region.
Tina Dahlman agree. biomedical analyst principal safety representative Swedish Medical Association.
#Not asked

- **We working analyzes asked, informed via intranet capacity sampling calculated additional 30 samples day Dalarna's 30 health centers. could 900 samples - addition ones already today. know staff equipment have, handle maximum 400 total.**

She claims decision rooted either responsible managers floor staff.

- turned expectations public, found actually possible do, says Tina Dahlman.

How many PCR analyzes ongoing covid-19 done depends several factors: personnel, machine capacity, materials, time.

- Performing analysis takes four hours total. must prepare sample several steps putting plate run machine extracts DNA. machine take 96 samples time takes hour half. transferred another machine also takes hour half, explains Tina Dahlman.

**Even machines run around clock, capacity would suffice.**

- **And lack staff work around clock. started work shifts, staff would suffice**, says Tina Dahlman.

#Get help others

Chief physician Roger Larsson Dalarna agrees region's maximum capacity analysis PCR samples covid-19 approximately 400 samples per day. also says present, know big need is.

- must see storm. time, also want make full use capacity have. samples handle, opportunity take help neighboring regions temporary peaks.

*What happens number samples becomes analyze longer period?*

- course, must reduce number times sampling health centers. check every day located, says Roger Larsson.

#Brakes sampling

In Västra Götaland, region recently decided slow sampling private individuals. recent weeks, number samples taken PCR analysis ongoing covid infection increased significantly region 20,000 per week. situation laboratories strained long response times stressed work situation, according regional management.

On [Care Association's blog]( biomedical analyst Marie Karlsson, works Sahlgrenska University Hospital, writes situation clinical microbiology terrible recent weeks.
**""Completely without warning, late Monday afternoon 1/6, began roll copious amounts samples, addition enormous amount samples already handle every day,"" Marie Karlsson says blog. ""My colleagues feel bad mentally physically really know going end us human beings. struggle break exhaustion,""** writes.

#Significantly increased sampling

In early June, government agreed SKR, Sweden's municipalities regions, greatly increased testing regarding corona virus. applies PCR analyzes ongoing infection antibody assays see covid-19 before.

The government allocated SEK 1.2 billion committed paying types testing. individual, PCR analyzes free charge, recommendation intrinsic fee antibody analyzes SEK 200. despite money, takes time regions scale sampling analysis capacity.

Although regions go also offer antibody tests widely public, sampling PCR analysis ongoing infection invested expanding. Antibody tests wait. news agency TT contact 16 country's 21 regions. these, 15 respond exact date public offered antibody tests. Several state late summer. Certainly. However look current development, long believe ratio hold up? guess could explain amount Karen sightseeing we've experienced recently. One friends tried ""thoughtful considerate"" FB thread topic yesterday. 

All say - \*lot\* kids need science instruction actual teacher, tinfoil/red trucker hat wearing parents. number insisted schools better open better make kids wear masks hoax, mild flu, masks unsanitary, unsafe, etc.... must deleting comments left right keep things civil.

My older two kids college students. One recent comments one parent group pages reeling - ""we mask wearing family"". Like fashion statement something. I'd argue genetic predispositions that's good argument. Note: people saying thing Chinese individuals back started true. 

Unfortunately answer racism.

It's probably linked socioeconomic status (black Americans likely impoverished due systemic racism) well institutionalized racism healthcare. 

As people keep bringing (response original comment)- recognized changed. may think ""we bigger things worry racism, there's pandemic!"" contrary, black Americans killed frequently virus another screaming sign need change. sooner change sooner black Americans stop disproportionately dying. kids college time USA gets covid. kids yet... Well said day. ""We last close first reopen"" floated idea hospital want get non-smokers addicted nicotine.

All current smokers get patches that's pretty routine anyway. Thoughts prayers. Thoughts prayers. Good sign corporate overlords want everyone mask. Maybe government officials get board handlers demand it. folks #winning looks like.  That's Tallahassee best. Billions healthcare companies, big fuck poor. Maybe found people infected tested, haha. moral “rights” negative rights, i.e. right something done government. They’re restrictions placed state, guarantee citizens entitled free goods services. that’s healthcare is: goods services. live Kansas. Gov. earlier month said masks required. county live said optional city council meeting decide want listen State County. None forced to. NFL wants push playing NFL give hazard pay accept float bill go hospital virus. Sports literal worst thing right now. Two teams meeting infect city...  “DOWN TENFOLD!” We'll probably see worldometer tally catch 60k today. There's zero stock Oxford vaccine found month, next month. There's also zero stock vaccine workable widespread use even year. 

Inoculate seven billion people? takes time. *A lot time*. there's anti-vax factor.  36% Americans would refuse COVID vaccine even one found. That's third population. 

There's reason always said vaccine earliest would Spring 2021 talk girlfriend this. wore mask entire time Publix decides move cashier thought cashier difficult time understanding talking mask.

Like would that? can’t hear you, drop pointless small talk. I’m sure 50+ year old lady doesn’t want pull mask down. Actually read whole thing..,,it's tangentially related best. 

*""With Covid-19 raging, ARDS serious complication treatment might helpful ongoing battle pandemic. ""*

It treat COVID, treats complication COVID. 

 *'Of course, study mice would need much testing clinical trials'* 

So related directly COVID also shown actually help human beings anyway shape form. 

1. Treat covid.
2. tested humans
3. mice Coronavirus
4. tell us anything useful dealing Covid whatsoever.

Meaning directly related COVID, yet another spam article promoting weed sort miracle drug help Covid-19, whereas still zero evidence affect. 

Now something actually contribute? like original poster wasting time? kind species lettuce spiral? 
Added [overview healthcare severely strained Sweden]( due pandemic. It’s remarkable many knock-on effects it’s had. seems like corner healthcare remained unaffected. surprising many teachers could change voting habit this.

Fuck no. get COVID diligently locking wearing mask tune public better get turned away Arizonan moron got 4th July party shipped state. China said aerosol transmit Feb. Schools shut quickly back March, largely due hitting Spring Break coming back. incredibly lucky, think.

Schools already cesspools disease. Timmy Billy share lunchroom, hallways, classrooms, equipment, everything else manage. importantly, share bathrooms. lunch hours, school 1000 kids filter almost 4-6 bathrooms. 

Hell, even class schedules mean kids rotate room room, teacher teacher. 

I bet modeled it, one infected student could expose every single person school within five days -- less.

Something likely appreciated much higher risk exposure become one parent child allowed school. parent wear mask, stay six feet others possible, even office 50 people, effectively limited exposure. school though. virus factory waiting pump much death possible. 

You can't keep kids touching one another. wear masks properly. time would take clean one room would completely disruptive school day. 

Opening schools go opening restaurants, worse. Everything seem fine weeks. one one whole schools shut governors order full closures. With, course, back plan childcare education thousands infected adults. care debt caused severe strain Sweden’s healthcare system poor coronavirus response surely lead cases people cancer diseases able get care need lower quality life even dying. sad. doesn’t mean safe ... outdoor safe I’m sorry... airborne exponential VIRUS let remind you

However, fatalities disease may well undercounted. factor ten. Infections certainly undercounted that. 12 times ""a tiny amount"" equal ""a large amount"".

But religious people feel strongly double standard policies applied similar across industries. San Francisco barring indoor services 12 people. Meanwhile indoor retail little limitations (only 6 feet distancing). Manufacturing, warehousing logistics limits. Professional sports practices okay (and definitely 12 people).

Additionally San Francisco banned outdoor services, pretty safe. Meanwhile, one saying anything BLM protests hundreds people people exercising/ congregating park wearing masks. go cities like New York people congregating outdoor bars East Village, quite large number people wearing masks subways, etc.

Moreover, clear religious institutions US specifically singled out. accounts 650 cases 0.02%. Meatpacking hand accounts cases, prisons nursing homes 40% deaths.. addition, recent infection young people come bars, restaurants, parties, etc, many tend wearing masks getting level attack. San Francisco banning indoor parties 12 people (for example).

At end, one disagrees indoor religious services high risk, steps taken mitigate risk. others similar risks face amount heat government mandates. Instead, churchgoers called uneducated selfish, whereas one saying similar things BLM protestors young people. unnecessary double standard calls question rationale behind recent policies. brother ICU doctor Chicago able set negative pressure multiple units. God bless HVAC engineer helped design it, ended unit patient several weeks later since recovered. thing contagious af.

The comforting news everyone wised realized everyone wearing masks AROUND infections department went down. Initially doctors nurses got sick quarantine I'm sure know, total infection rates hospital staff *in Covid units* ended lower general patient population, Covid not. wear n95 better aerosolizing procedures surgical mask times everything else, really reduced infections HCP working ICU. 6% antibodies lower community level. (I think people careful Covid unit usually decide 25 person barbecue house assisting intubation.)

This great news means whatever reason, surgical masks actually work. 

We seen many examples people getting sick aerosols like choir got sick, call center, restaurant diagram, strengthens case aerosol. assume mask must reduce escapes infected person's mouth nose LOT. receiver wears mask, maybe protects little. 

It could also virus travel small water vapor particles, whatever reason viral load enough infect people distance 49 50 times. call center next person speaking day, get hundreds opportunities get infected, boom.

They’re way. NY didn’t suddenly explode Rona overnight—it seemed way literally didn’t testing exponentially mulitplying. Cuomo dithered even testing rolled numbers kept going up, *forced* lockdown.

Now testing, watch real time numbers go up, state leaders dither dig heels refuse lockdown. don’t think anywhere surged way gotten away without lockdown.

(The problem mandated face masks keep chances lower catching Rona, don’t eliminate odds entirely. you’re low enough case point, that’s enough keep things manageable. things totally control, you’re likely large numbers people slipping cracks sheer number people walking around active infections.)

ICU bed room; make anywhere. issue places like NYC Italy ran hospitals filled up, staff started getting sick needing quarantine (or even worse taking ICU beds themselves). that's trouble begins. Couple ICU magical place admitted everyone recovers. ICU patients invariably going mean deaths. people going recover. Masks required city. 

Cops don’t wear em. Nobody does. aerosol = less 5 um. anyone good info prevalent virus-laden sizes 0 5 um range? could make pretty big difference mask strategies.

Eg particles worry 1 5 um range, cloth masks work well. 0.3 0.5 um range (for instance) careful choice fabrics filters. live Arizona. 

My mother works Scottsdale Unified School District. want go back work person Monday, even though everyone working fine home, absolutely reason. 

I keep posting stuff. One anti-masker friends finally talked asked scientific articles effectiveness face masks last night thanked them. little, late, better never, suppose. 

If live Arizona, keep speaking this. enough people know. People walking around like everything’s normal. Ducey isn’t going enough help us. Look follow numbers, unlike 90% people screaming lockdowns, dont need unemployment check I'm going make decisions based politics. 

Cases way up. Deaths flat. PERIOD. deaths ""lag 3-5 weeks"" whatever number week. 

People dying multiple conditions. odds dying COVID lower taking long drive.

Those susceptible stay home. everyone else, prefer sane children people able run small businesses. People seem forget extended lockdowns mean small business closings (and big business thriving), means people struggling financially, means people poverty, causes sorts negative outcomes (health, education, etc.).

So, yes, rooting many cults crooks catch possible, they’re gatekeepers preventing rest us getting work this. really saying thanking media country well? can't tell joking serious. didn’t protect job either. Lotta places permanently closed, brought back part time. went 50 hrs 20. Also lotta people didn’t get unemployment time either parents declined intubation hospital recommended. 


 go fund page raise $55k hospital expenses. catch virus die really nice. New Zealand done great job COVID response. think US equipped handle this, since government providing suggestions additional funding help schools open safely provide unified roadmap. Nearly school districts across country directed come plan execute. Everyone flying solo journey hoping best... virus making way across globe God's will

And given God's (supposedly) infallible.. tend major racist flip public, seems help start viral firestorm gets fired. think headline “says every person brain” Well yeah. MurderWorld thing happening world. America alone there's 5-20% discrepancy historical monthly total deaths plus reported covid deaths versus current monthly total deaths. Covid related deaths probably around 140,000 - 160,000. There's difference atheism anti-theism. militant ones anti-theists - opposed belief god, theory religious beliefs dangerous. Atheists believe god, may may care whether anyone else agrees.

Anti-theism : Atheism :: Evangelical Christianity : Christianity Closing testing sites: 

The federal government closing 2 7 testing sites state, helping remaining 5 transition state-run. Meanwhile 948 testing sites Texas, 30 active mobile sites 41 opening next couple days. Losing 2 sound like ""testing sites slowing closing"" meaningful way. Moving beds: (There’s better factual info , don’t time search it) 

Yes, chunk COVID patients flood certain hospitals, move less burdened hospitals. Sounds reasonable. Saying they're ""have low ICU counts"" makes sound nefarious. TMC Phase 2 ICU capacity, sustainable increase standard ICU capacity. plan Phase 3 expansion even go beyond needed. 75% total bed capacity Abbott blaming everybody himself: Blaming leaders: 

I know connection Abbott blasting enforcing orders, living Texas, I've read plenty articles local law enforcement openly stating enforce mask orders. Local law enforcement accountable enforcing orders. indoors? I'm worried outdoor mask usage. Indoor mask usage needs go wayyyy more. Floridians like “fuck school” close em lower property taxes. Islam holding us back? Lololol I've made two attempts respond auto-modded bc politics, I'm it. Anyway yeah, good point, interesting see plays out. Sorry, don’t mean heat hurting helping virus, meant heat drives human behavior - human behavior indeed stupid! 

Hot weather makes lot people seek ac, especially don’t ac home. Ac means indoors, people pack indoor areas virus spread easier. colder weather Californians (and northern CA particularly) sought vacations warm places (I suspect cases could’ve brought home way) definitely spending time indoors weather got nice; exacerbated outdoor recreation areas closed (no walking, parking there, ticket car park go walk woods kind shit) people without yards stuck indoors walking around neighborhood, likely pedestrian friendly. 

If live place community housemates isolating it’s going spread fast, everyone’s indoors single housemate brings home essential job trip grocery store whole house may get it. essential worker must work confined space indoors may rip coworkers. 

If live place community housemates aren’t isolating it’s gonna sure rip community. Especially non isolating events occur indoors without masks. Especially especially indoor activities include eating drinking alcohol, since neither mask friendly activities alcohol results less social distancing loud speaking. 

And shit ac home it’s hundred degrees get heat stroke apartment. ac apartments predominantly rented low-income already vulnerable populations like elderly - old people isolating indoors die heat stroke every (regular) summer do. That’s fair people. there’s good option seeking indoor ac leads easily contagious situation. 

I wish people different, I’m luck changing anyone myself. It’s fucking disheartening. Unfortunately sub far reason, never evident today we've recently saw ""Are enjoying lockdown"" thread upvoted posts extremely anti social tech nerds happy able play video games day, alcoholics loving fact drink meetings.

Reason went door long ago, thread proof people represent average worker making ends meat rather mentality entitled suburban teen. USA can't take credit showing Canada do.  suspect Canada used common sense like world.  common sense rest world UNcommon sense USA.

This issue isn’t black white. I've read whole thing remember line chicken-spinning. What's from?

Given added risk us fat asses, masks (for everyone) even important. Lol slow testing more.

Pretty vile. wonder many unreported cases even now! Wait schools open again...BOOM!!! Headline says churchgoers major source coronavirus cases. Thats incredibly deceiving. 650 length pandemic tied back churches. 650/3,100,000 %0.02 cases. Statistically insignificant hardly cause headline. 

For record I’m strongly camp churches remain virtual. based numbers, looks like good job that... Exactly NJ forcing schools reopen September. bad idea. Maybe try praying harder? agree. work Tennessee, feel way. Many us older preexisting conditions, like hypertension, employer classifying hypertension exemption, diabetes critical kidney lung issues.

People board cheering Sweden showing numbers going approach want negative According recent studies, HIT (Herd Immunity Threshold) 10-20%, virus burn loses ability infect people.

Scientists Oxford, Virginia Tech, Liverpool School Tropical Medicine, recently explained HIT COVID-19 paper:

*We searched literature estimates individual variation propensity acquire transmit COVID-19 infectious diseases overlaid findings vertical lines Figure 3. CV estimates comprised 2 4, range naturally acquired immunity SARS-CoV-2 may place populations herd immunity threshold 10-20% individuals immune.*

Calculations study [data showed HIT 17%.

Back May 4, Stanford’s Nobel-laureate Dr. Michael Levitt advocated Sweden’s approach letting COVID-19 spread naturally community arrive HIT. 

He stated:

*If Sweden stops 5,000 6,000 deaths, know they’ve reached herd immunity, didn’t need kind lockdown. feeling probably stop herd immunity. COVID serious, it’s least serious flu. it’s going destroy humanity people thought.*

Deaths Sweden PEAKED HIT halfway peak (roughly 7.3%) time virus hit 14% nearly extinguished. 50+ hours weekly? That’s crazy! 35-37 full time position I’m European countries. even time live life you’re working 50 hours week. current world overall CFR 4.59%. people 40, far lower. side-note, Air conditioning universally hated Italy even Summer heat, people discouraged turning on. think might effect. 

FWIW, \*total remaining active cases\* entire country Italy little 13,000. average 150-200 new daily cases, require hospitalization mild (probably masks), third new cases identified following positive antibody tests death rate falling nationwide. That's illusion.  deaths also going go significantly AZ/TX/FL coming weeks.

The death rate probably never reach level NY Northeast hit. Millions millions cases went completely undetected, we're catching far actual total now. Also docs gotten better treatment drugs shown promising results critical patients. mask he’s wearing protects  That's awfully low bar, Justin. Well I’m denying happening. Even news sources China catch traces ( stated previous comment). I’m really pointing certain groups behind topic using propaganda benefit, groups *clean* well. 

As point, interesting sounds promising indeed. would really like link original source. Especially “one million” figure. really many death sentences issued 2000. 10 percent children's parents need intensive care death we'll even think anything Wearing mask around chin like putting condom balls. recent bout online education proved anything proved mass online education work.

I've also seen fair bit ""we stopped hospitals getting overwhelmed, they've time prepare we're good!"". People really seem want think ahead this, that's destroying us. Think colleges too. college might located area low covid numbers. But, students return colleges country. That's going bring virus areas hit going rip through.

Christians that? worship meditate whatever effectively home? states counties recovering first wave, New York, states counties really starting experience first wave, combine states gives impression number deaths going down. look individual states counties Texas Arizona obvious number deaths increased states. Time tell places get bad worse New York. Right now, certain states counties, numbers going wrong direction. 1% I’m scared this. developed cough sore throat days ago (isolating getting tested tomorrow) cannot risk brain damage. already four concussions (one tbi) life hard enough already. Fuck virus everyone doesn’t take seriously. Pimachu face test result wait times like US states, non-US countries? Georgia we're running 7-10 days get test results, due labs backed up. Atlanta mayor, tested positive recently, even wait 8 days get results. Also, test sites really slammed hard get appointment, book 10+ days government sites really unhelpful even add delay getting results.

I'm worried going get worse worse labs overloaded, eventually fall we'll waiting 2-3 weeks results. deaths goalpost reached, they’ll move something else. It’ll even ridiculous absurd, people know fall droves body count rises. 21th century church still responsible mass death 🙄 Yeah Vaccinations Institute University Oxford know vaccinations anyway Spanish, ASL, French, Arabic, Chinese. Language classes. It’s difficult learn language online student isn’t aware errors much learned interactions.

Nooe, Florida hospice nurse tested every two weeks due possible contact infected patients. complains constantly us ppe wearing masks goes out- goes much possible. Somehow death every two minutes means everything control according president know.. deaths usually accessible, basically hospitalization trends delayed. guys focused much masks yet simply forgot social distancing.

However, replace washing hands social distancing. may offer placebo effect wearing one properly, one made wrong materials. right, thanks notifying me! boggles mind americans putting shit Well expecting serious answer shower thought, conclusion got too. Hahaha used Rock’s lingo. Would call wrestlers jabronis signature move people’s elbow I'm sad say I'm numb now. Numbers numbers. feel like people anymore somehow. 

Getting covid death sentence people. people exhibit long term health effects recovering, unclear widespread is. far science goes, majority people end recovering without needing hospitalized. 

So numbers 6000 60,000 even 100,000 cases really big deal since majority recover long term effects. Cali blame anyone themselves. live here. People even taking first quarantine seriously. way hell gonna sit.  thought HR protect ME!

/s hope ever suffer child died arms bury little body.  

Empathy bred experience clearly experiences given ability empathetic young people write hatred disdain. hope life remains good never put someone else's shoes way have. 

Have good day man. Won’t god save them? vast majority people miss whole point book. book fables parables designed help one live ""righteously"". instruction manual certainly taken literally. also edited times book history constantly reworked kings elite control poor masses. one wants pay attention though use reason continue closed minded thoughts uphold ""freedom"". everyone, obviously, damn certain power church. flocks follow ""what jesus would do"". Reading full bible looking way interpreted, used weaponized huge amounts power exactly drove it. Well, I, one, call re!arded time....and disabled.....I anti-PC.....in tough world, people whining words? Mentally challenged, re$arded,,,,,it's thing: label. state form report institutions following mask guidelines. dad (who ""blue"" state) told dangerously left governor created form specifically ask people report churches gun ranges. looked form, saw ""Institution Type"", Religious Institutions Gun Ranges options...just Businesses, Schools, Gyms, etc. many Americans, seeing religious institutions held STANDARDS businesses health safety, equates ""attacks specifically focused churches"". 1/4 worlds deaths total, people consistently want say big deal death rate great compared places 

Like space race 1960s something, ok people dying like Brazil higher death rate per capita 

Such bizarre way thinking lockdown UK introduced far late meaningful effect. was, essence, pointless. 

The number infections peaked month ago number deaths peaked two months ago. Since then, declined dramatically easing restrictions effect either. 

In meantime, restaurants shut put people work suppliers business. order functioning economy, need businesses &amp; running, people work people spending money. measure works towards that, good thing. corporations begging governmental restrictions, know something gone dangerously awry would debate ""commonly known"" part. Well religion problem. Absolutely agree beginning said buildings (school, offices, factories, etc) ill equipped. think it’s widely accepted poor air quality circulation inherent buildings. Unless building designed intention. pointing variables data change time learn. cannot good science lot people getting people refuse wear masks. user seems suggesting current administration seemed likely perform worse based president's previous history failing home run business models casino ownership. believe comment also intended suggest homework electing president time lucky suffering so.

TLDR - said NEARLY darkest timeline, quite. people making diseases don’t really give shit teachers admin. know means, made laugh. I’ve heard lot pastors around country say it’s one thing places like bars, gyms, restaurants closed. so, churches closed “respect governing authorities” thing. several places specifically singled churches similar places open. 

Those seem like two different things. Churches law also shouldn’t singled other, similar gatherings permitted. I'm Christian related any. someone explain quote associated cheesemaker? Hi there, already posted Reposts removed. frustrates much simply certain church leadership gotten bed GOP culture war. black white evil. heed Jesus' words care cared yet claim follow Jesus. believe Jesus would call 'goats' Matthew 25:31-46. husband thinks thing. think we’re seeing happens malignant narcissist develops dementia feel like America past point slow virus down. going happen. many ignorant, selfish people here. us dealing that, 25 year olds. far 6 family members passed away. 5 Covid 1 stomach cancer ( delayed going hospital Covid) . 

3 5 early 50s. 2 mid 80s. 

It pretty traumatic hurts family mom's side, live pretty damn long. quite family members live past 100. Even years would meant alot. 

These numbers statistics deaths treated like numbers people. They're actual lives families devistated this. needs happen, although might late now, start fresh, work flatten curve, Americans understand social distancing important, things like wearing mask important, etc, actually try follow CDC guidelines ok states ease restrictions. we'll continue live way make breakthrough therapy, vaccine made available.

We could avoided actually listened doctors scientists telling us learned early on. Instead deciding good return normal we'd beaten thing. Essential sunday story time come get ""washed blood"" magic sky man... get covid die they're like ""he works mysterious waaaaaays"" survive like ""oh hallelujah miracle"" Nah, nothing insane nonsense words strung together, really fucking dumb lol we're spelling systemic racism now? Fully agree. expecting way cases. 650 actually seems like noted positive safely they’re opening.. people read headline I’m guessing. Lmao. Stop getting upset don’t panic seeing article. want that, you! can't enforce something tools. There's literal assaults happening worst case people tell F keep shopping anyway. 

Your choice call law enforcement, may may anything. Literal sheriff's offices refusing enforce orders exist. 

The thing think is, would stores bounces like bar/night club. think way bouncers ever get away physically removing people start fight trying to. Universities arrange occasional in-person classes international students forget unlock classroom door week. maybe want curve flat y-axis x-axis? that's works. virus can't defy physics gravity. cough sneeze lands floor, unless someone gets way (and lands them)

Good thing I’m suggesting virus defy physics gravity.

Later mention breezes, must aware airs ability circulate inside necessarily restricts movement air.

Also coronavirus aerosolizes stay aloft Proximity virus works. Hell, right wind, outside could detrimental inside, spread cough sneeze 6 feet.

Sure, proximity determined concentration virus air, increased air means lower concentration virus. Nah, Trump already tried best got walmart let us use parking lot bit. deny everything dead. virus. Like yesterday go: one talking lasting damage ""recovered""cases. Looks like least 1 10 infected. would encourage folks actually follow guidelines. ""peaceful"" protests spread covid? Economic damage harmful permanent damage innards worse, death.

Please pull head ass. could right word d? automod blacklist. churches drive past sale signs front. Maybe time pay damn share taxes, seeing they're responsible lot deaths country  Nothing 20% hospitalization rates half permanent damage. Good News, DeSantis extended state emergency continue nothing think churches, synagogues, mosques, religious services adhering guidelines. Unfortunately, takes one isn’t cause another outbreak. big percentage people crippling long term illness.

I've seen people equate going church, even small church, dangerous protest that's happened. 
 
Okay? That’s we’re discussing. believe you’ve seen that.
 I've see CNN claim protests caused spikes corona. 
 
I believe you’ve seen that, too. 
 
Mostly data currently available suggests protests major contributor positive cases. don’t believe data, always look fact protests occurred globally specific areas spiking.
 mindset plagues /r/politics, Reddit whole. Anything Christian Conservative nature wrong.
 
This another separate, brand-new argument. Agreed. lean right understand Trump thinking going view point majority citizens. digging grave election fellow republicans know it. what?! 5 million?! never heard this?!!!

Probably Spanish Flu killing x10 times number period. feel better now? Got ragey internet? Please seek counseling. issues Trump 1 play book. things go wrong, blame everyone else. I'm American Christian. baffled complete knobs many Christians U.S. are.

I set foot church since Corona. member one since border child separation policy.

People nuts. people don’t drive ICU, Karen. parents, kids choose too. mother like brothers kids....because can't stand since never warm inviting done anything ever.

Yet still thinks deserves love attention. Asking read would same. many epidemiologists think economic council staff? many contact tracers have? 

Their study garbage. 650 cases “major source” virus predictable, yet many states wait see proof cases spike. assume holding miracle? anti-science, religious. used go school attached church long time ago. church extremely corrupt truly care money. Minister Foreign Affairs, interview non-medical person then? studied political science. actually need thoughtful discussion schools though. Unfortunately two stances heard care anyone dies, kid probably Well President said it, want it. Plus *feels* dangerous

The first immoral callousness towards human life, second ignores (still young questionable) science children maybe significant vectors Covid-19, serious harm might allow regular social interaction regular learning. Look bright side: means two thirds tests came back negative! 694 population density sheer population matter  person you’re talking hilariously uninformed. even bigger battle anti-vaxxers refuse them

Then screw tolerable way achieve herd immunity

There herd immunity long keep cross-infecting animals. “no shirt, shoes, service” signs? go infringed freedoms posed those? that’s fine grew with, “no shirt, shoes, mask , service” Satan’s way destroying life earth.  Reminder: guys “conservative” Americans attacked 9/11 wore something heads. 

The “conservatives” carrying assault rifles demanding wear masks preserve right living biological weapons. 

Idea: maybe “conservatives” aren’t racist stupid, maybe really hate wearing loose cloth heads?

This common sense. Even Arizona 25% positive rate, even story happened, came back positive. worked assessment center, cannot fake whole bunch patients. Even succeeded, would lose licence saying did. Anyone would believe something like probably worth much time. less 20 people hospital COVID-19 entire country.

That's get assuming everyone reddit US. government helping, Trump signed executive order force slaughterhouses stay open record amounts pork could exported Praise Jesus culling flock evil false worshippers. willfully held person services, intentionally exposed members COVID.

That said, agree points serious balls understand worked Sweden, differ strategy execution.

The public health agency public press breifings every day current status. calculate simulate, keep scientific debate, give advice politicians authorities, public based findings. scientists. execute. public, regions, municipalities , police, privately owned parts wellfare services do.

Some policy making, though policy execution, terms health delegated democratically elected regions. include contingency plans medical care. elderly care, part regions. eldery care commisioned financed municipalities. even though national law set framework do, democratically elected municipalities set tax rates, goes regions.

I'd also like point majority deaths occured areas, politically led right wing parties. wonder want fly radar false notion know they're obliged (and failed) do. know heard that, that's origin argument regarding 'Sweden informing strategy' complete bogus. agree 100%, sub filled people almost seem relish bad news wouldn’t started “any country”.

We're hunters, makes sense me.

I really, really recommend it. VR feel like leaving house. one best investments make, think, especially right now. Finally, know surgical mask loose. simply, video shows, need pull loops behind head bring around opposite ears. assumed loops went directly corresponding ear. one ever noticed warned me... Case solved, thankfully. know mask usage far greater Disney protest right? probably 100% likely high going get US. might even true anymore anyways. 
There deaths yesterday last Monday, deaths today last Tuesday.

Would want it? idea information prevents speaking us.

What employment anything

Contract tracers cant enforce anything. job inform you’ve exposed direct resources. 35 days long enough. Italy needed 75.

Anything less irresponsible pointless. ""Love long time"" Even worse implications IMO. 984 ICU beds left across State Florida according AHCA's Dashboard.

Why Newsweek article telling us available beds? He's still hiding bodies, kid? Feeding imagination yours!

Remember said even 1,000 people would die NYC like &lt;4 months ago?

Good times. he’s totally innocent Lol wayyy half UK intubate patients died care homes/ home outside pandemic anyway due age quality life drop put vent would severe irreversible. I've heard doctors situation would prefer use morphine palliative care methods help slip peacefully. main issue NHS discharging COVID positive patients carehomes, pretty easily foreseeable consequences. lesson? missed part people car accidents health emergencies SOL doctors, hospital beds, ambulances, etc full covid patients?

You don’t see soldiers running around saying refuse enforce orders superiors war overseas. Especially comes protecting innocent people fellow military members. 

These sheriffs trash. Pure trash. That's one way cut cases. People refusing get tested. /s Anyone shitty person lol. Dont care dont believe 🙃🙂 Day yet 992 + death +55,255 new cases, holy fuck.

There reason nobody takes seriously. AZ, people around didn’t know anyone first exploded US. gave false sense security prematurely reopened. coincided around time weather changed hot outside. people wanted get back social, way inside boom exploded. NZ has. cases Kiwis coming home flights. Everyone coming gets tested twice compulsory 14 day managed isolation. one allowed leave virus active. it, go full quarantine till clear. 

We around 20 cases quarantine moment.

We 68 days since spread community, awesome normal lifestyle again. *almost* fucked situation weeks ago letting people compassionate passes tests, huge uproar, military oversee border isolation, Health Minister resigned string cockups.

(*drowning positive cases Florida*)  agree substantive points, except one immunity. I’m sure contain virus “healthy” populations starts pushing herd immunity thresholds (which say still try contain virus much possible moving re-entry methodical, data based way).

That said, data data — policies need based data. New York (unfortunately) already laid pretty clear roadmap handle virus reopen effectively. roadmap get better get data improve past mistakes. purpose fucking nursing degree unfollowed medical advice risk life child. people fucking moron. bro.. hes setting punchline deadly people saying. says 5he virus never better deaths are.. thinks hes right open. lockdowns dont work. Hes setting excuses lockdown again. Deaths spiking cases new cases reopening. natural need checklist study 6000 people went hospital COVID lower incidence smoking general population. That’s it. That’s extent evidence. anyone half brain tell “ finding” “ evidence” idiotic.  What's important antibodies memory cells. I'm citing basically saying Australians shitty masks policies. Pot meet kettle. 

Seriously, feel say Australians shitty masks, U.S. think need look backyard change rather here. okay. 

Masks become policy such. policy yet. strict rules social distancing, hygiene, quarantine even app download. get $1500 per fortnight stay home, money given people lost jobs. policies. free health care free testing clinics stay car get tested. Catching ambulance costs us nothing. 

I paying attention, seems need focus live. 

What Vietnam it? never mentioned Vietnam. state leaving implementing guidelines local districts. I’m pretty sure means providing supplies funds bare minimum necessary. 

Not mention CDC guidelines take account high likelihood virus airborne (preprint articles circulating information call action).  number cases FLA steadily rising since June 11 number deaths remained constant.

Not really. HALF Florida COVID cases int last 2 weeks. big jump relatively recent. total 200,000 coronavirus cases Florida recorded last two weeks.

So big jump weeks old (and that's oldest big jump; rest recent 2 weeks) takes 4-5 weeks infections turn deaths statistics. 

So already seeing Florida break records daily deaths, huge jump recent cases made death statistics yet. Arizona votes mail. Always time around too. going make people vote Trump security homes. One could credibly argue multi-polar world inherently unstable almost inevitably leads states competing global hegemon. pretty much describes Europe late 1600s World War Two. distribution overall density. everyone Texas moved city four times size Washington DC, intents purposes, would expect face challenges DC, despite overall population density vastly different.

come on....

oh wait , unless money buying shit.....  still hit miss real world. *one* person show clinic say, ""Well. something stupid. went beach."" one.

 have, however, least 50 employees last week COVID testing clinic. . Oh! conversed sorted Reddit, well, concerned whistleblowers businesses continuing ""business usual"", keeping positive results themselves. employees heard sick coworkers via telephone, came tested own. 

I also heard.....and worst it: certain beach bar, well known us Worker's Comp violations, employees tested positive working. told work would fired. (I indicated employee voiced report incident OSHA DOH. said maybe people afraid less people get infected die.  understand fear bad thing. healthy response situation like survival tactic.

Sounds pretty chill! Canada, that’s entirely possible. Yeah, backlog deaths long weekend stacked onto one day totally reverses 3 month long trend. Sheesh see 

time tell People piss moan ""no evidence evidence"" ignore fact 90% spam pure absolute conjecture, supposition extrapolation based nothing ""study suggests"" ""may, could, might."" People really think consensus science thing. actually insufferable. Fucking Rick Morty, Big Bang Theory trogs. Exactly, delay date death day reported absurdly long. people died weeks ago. huge number recent cases resulting deaths announced weeks.

Despite lag, deaths trending Arizona, Texas Florida now. I've doubt protests contribute, saying surge started *with* protests, protests caused surge. instantly go infection symptoms. Something protests started surge. Like state reopening soon and/or memorial day. Let protest, want slaves grind, essentially they’re advocating — name “freedom.” 0.74% positivity Ontario, Canada become CNA 2 months, LPNs associates degrees, RN's associates bachelor's So, lives matter? teacher rural R state, personally know people otherwise intelligent except comes COVID, climate change, big bang, evolution. accept science fits world view, not, conspiracy demons hoax. hot, know people meeting indoors blasting AC, know risky days. 

&amp;#x200B;

I think Southern states worse rate summer Northeast brace Fall/Winter. Yeah agree math then. 0.5% IFR 1/4 infections caught two weeks ago would put today's deaths around 2% day's cases. 

The last two weeks seen positivity rise means we're catching smaller number infections now, two weeks could higher percentage today's cases dying.

On January 23rd entire world doubt seriousness virus, time 800 cases WORLDWIDE 25 deaths, entire world. 


One week later entire genome virus sequenced labs world studying it. &lt;200 deaths thousand cases GLOBALLY.  


We plenty warning countries headed fared incredibly well, countries ignored got crushed.  


How exactly would China giving us extra weeks head make difference?? countries take seriously end January taken seriously beginning January either. them, idea warning China straight gaslighting.  


Shit following sub end January, random redditors right sub even knew... random internet kids figured theres excuses governments ignored it. Go covid party. Got covid. That's mission accomplished !!! Success !! Where's beef ? 43 hospitals ICU beds. ICU critical condition, makes tough move another hospital room, need ICU going go shopping around hospital space, going closet hospital. 22 28 days infection death average yes glad live part world without much air conditioning, even less central air. We’ll take it. Please it’s have. husband chronic pain, quality life even good days. Adding something like decreased lung capacity even bad cough months would make life basically unlivable. 

I two family members visit shortly visiting someone mortician exposed covid patients. visiting mean went party inside home. glad see family bit, outside only, upset would that, especially without heads first. Well countries shown possible. mean tough us US accomplish this. Besides things like hang indoor dining never fond much anyway. go necessities follow guidelines. online Church work outside away anyone else. always hated going get haircut time myself. live sticks. possible never get never know. rare vasculitis disease careful anyways flu things passed around. Besides going Church building life changed much compared folks. always order groceries things online too. I'm sorry term limits terrible idea. know lifetime politician? Trump.

Term limits ensures wealthy run lobbyists control government even inexperienced people know government works. completely clean virus Maritime provinces, American wandered in, we've got three cases Nova Scotia five PEI. One guy led least eight cases. American appropriately quarantine, go again. There's lot anger we're enough ensure quarantines enforced.  True, angers healthcare professionals essential workers risking lives idiots. death cult strong one. better expecting. Campaign promise fulfilled! 4 years! /s really state confidence? Seriously, even bother spend 10 seconds googling something could quickly cleared up? even know 2 countries Korean peninsula? I'm flabbergasted. Isn’t government’s job? Thank you. suspected this. figure you, wreaking havoc. also think get second tsunami sized wave, current one stays size, people immune compromised. American, blame them. one bit. know makes sense. I'm even saying malicious, states hard time grappling disease keep all.

What I'm confused excess mortality study date lines excess deaths Florida/Texas/Georgia tune.

Edit:

Actually makes sense. think numbers linking taking account multiple causes death. death labeled covid pneumonia depending dataset looking at. 

This would make sense we're seeing excess 3k deaths Florida based previous pneumonia deaths; lines excess mortality 3k Florida, 2900 tagged covid.. That's can't lockdown way virus. DeSantis say he's Trump tool, maybe? Protect there! Take care. want open bad fucking mandate masks. Jesus. That's evaluating ""medical stuff"" evaluating believability persuasiveness, like jury does. Juries evaluate evidence complex medical scientific issues time without advanced background training. think he's suggesting could fired instruct co-workers self isolate something. Make 85 deaths many articles need make front page day? like 3 day point, always exact comments regurgitated 500 times:

- They're sending best!

- Canada build wall make America pay it!

- Canadian, keep shut!


- American, agree!

- Alaskan border loophole blamed every single active case Canada  piece shit, cover pedophiles racist. gives fuck think say? 

Go maskless shitstain Sure, let’s see. maybe case numbers overinflated “probable” cases recorded confirmed. 

I guess time tell. death rate seems way low Southern states. I'm beginning wonder covering data. Oh, US screwed big time: PPE/mask shortage/total lack federal support/etc. question there..

I'm correcting common myth US done spectacularly worse every developed European country. (We *end worse*, seems likely). extra 3-4 weeks video Italian ICUs made TV.

There less 2 weeks Italian outbreak start NY outbreak start (with Washington state middle), time Italian ICUs overwhelmed, NYC outbreak already reaching massive proportions. peak Italian cases around March 28, peak NY cases around April 10

The rest US lock though. Personally, young network/sys admin company 500 employees, got hit computer virus hard. wiped lot people's ability work several days cleaned things up. learned important prevention rapid response is. got hit early, AV signatures 3 days got hit.

We never another outbreak that. fact, next 6 years, 4 made user's desktop system designed using oss blocking 1000 per day quite often.

So yeah, I'm applying personal real life experience this. Security done layers.  layer called ""fuck it, hard"". government job do, failed.  Massively. expect people know opening border mean cases

And irony they'd likely lose long term forced close get hit outbreak. mean, working directly Fauci NIAID this. probably something. Nah Brah, need mask we're good! mask makes hard Tik Tok properly Brah! feel fine?

Um... kind of? felt pressure chest hour two ago, started reading article browsing thread. moment pressure's mostly gone.

I also pretty bad headacher earlier, I'm pretty sure that's so, consider might fine instead scouring internet panic triggers.

Yeah, I've always hypochondriac. think maybe take break sub days. American here. Keep border lock down. still people taking seriously. fucking nerve saying can't breathe. Smfh don't. make money people pay premiums file claims.

You're missing anything /u/f43s . subreddit dumb lol Damn that's nice. colleges like that? Frats one dirtiest places ever. surprised Typhoon Mary, bro.  make sense, virus indeed airborne, would lot serious, way harder contain. Mask usage state near 100% indoor locations. hurt one highly educated populations country, world.  BLAME CONGRESS Someone tested parents former workplace JHH Baltimore yes, 2 times harder breathe mask without.

So people already obstructed breathing wearing mask though personally say ""You pre-ex, stay hell home!"" well. Already hearing Alabama Lower death rates daily. It’s going away. Every weekend, counts delayed. We’ve seen phenomenon months. [But don’t take word need zero deaths. Long live Caesar. hospitalist smaller hospital Arizona described exact thing. Percentage community served 40-50%.

It seems range get let covid free. suppose increase variance due weighting applied sample. (23%,39%) then. study White sample 8% +/-2% sort statistical test racial differences would highly significant, knew already. Yeah, like... miss visiting people unless someone end lives, wait. Video chats now. is! Oh, honey... third world country first world military. None surprising. I'm actually surprised death rate even higher, maybe doctors getting better treating this. I'm tri-state area remember horror day seeing death counts NJ close 500 NY close 1000...so death rate right seems low oddly (I know fucked think way that's bad things here). Exactly. We've got plenty good candidates. need scammers  Daily cases reached 57,000 day US. Daily deaths also going again, 993 reported dead today. Expect hospitals run room, turn people die non virus related reasons hospitals overcapacity. hate living County right 🤦🏻‍♀️ Seems like light dimming even burned we've got start somewhere we? Given dramatic divergence public markets main street/the real economy, one concern -especially light massive misappropriation PPP funds (Kanye!) - awareness ever really compute, divergence continues things simply get worse bottom third. lot really basic bread butter, meat potatoes stuff requires decluttering cultural priorities divide distract.

Despite wrote, try allow much space grim it. Usually easiest thing act locally help way manageable. But, yes, there's question,as nation, we're badly need corrective action. I'm sure run re-learn walk motions connected,empathic society much less model nations. right, mean work. studies say work mean work. Imbecile. anybody iq 50 candidate take president's SATs look rest world, pretty obvious there's lot done without vaccine. really done yet. great, numbers great, number 1 world. stocks going tremendous numbers, pay wall military's money. Non American here, nothing personal, sadly leader acting like kid doesn’t part group project, rest group take extra measures ensure survive group project.

Kinda sucks you, citizens butt joke right Me? seen anyone age 50 since March. forgot mention SK doesn’t HIPPA... laws regarding public sharing (and shaming with) covid status.

Edit - also hell downvoted? You’re reciting facts regarding critical distinctions. monkeys also massively overdosed COVID still didn’t get it. That’s win. believe Tuesday higher includes weekend deaths. Cases higher toward end week probably many labs testing centers M-F. Really interested reading reports asymptomatic effects. Appreciate links papers original article Dr. Peter Schneider, UCSF Vascular Surgery Professor, commented on. Yikes - lady end pulled kids lost $300.....now understands probably saved thousands medical bills. Perhaps it’s getting shadowed US? \o/ Go path Plague Justinian call Plague Trump he's powerful leader crisis. whole law enforcement system needs scrapped rebuilt ground up. understand, want people stop getting tested?

The data virus, better. pandemic, modeling next pandemic go long way drafting better response plans future. exactly protect older population? love trigger words always get used ""rise by"" put negative spin it. Arizona 30% positive yesterday: rookie numbers! credit card companies violating customers privacy hospitals violating HIPPA regulations, law enforcement access records, that’s lotta search warrants Thats whats happening all. additional highlight unfit trump president. Understandable, nice day. form irony...? Maybe daily numbers... even would take 11 years Americans go extinct. Weird. thought brain damage Florida spreading it. Oh man trump's going get re-elected now. fair places like Wyoming North Dakota could easily driven cases 0 lockdown, mask wearing contract tracing. American can’t blame agree. It’s dumb what’s happening (more happening) here. Florida’s approach cave eventually. Sure, they’re testing nursing home staff every 2 weeks test negative today get exposed tomorrow. Someone works nursing home bound exposed whole nursing home protection bubble pop. amount people still spouting shit masks useless, cause infection, etc fucking depressing point. nothing done idiots, they're going putting everyone else risk result. can't fix stupid allowed talk politics thread politics? I'm sure keep situation complete moron political party actively trying kill us. Florida's former geographic information systems manager, Rebekah Jones, charge Covid webpage data, states Florida's top epidemiologist resigned today's announcement K-12 schools reopened: 16:25 like small city Estados Unidos... Like Trump like sheriffs, people law either. kind pointless say consider shit ton dumbass even believe covid real thing. *woop woop woop* Zoidberg. I'm sorry hear that. know feeling. parents Brooklyn since January terrified wreaking havoc especially mom right middle chemo.

New cases deaths pretty alarming. Look studies it, anything 88% extended periods bad cannot rely pulse oximeter tell going lungs. 95% totally normal, hard time believing doctor here. dont conditions regularly get 95% pulse oximeter reading. guess doctor worried rely pulse oximeter tell whats normal symptoms COVID-19, agree seek help immediately.  think propagating moronic points view helps here? No, I've yet gotten sick again. allergies, cold, nada, zilch. found coworker Rona19, 2 weeks actually moved workspace side operations floor know think point. coworkers got tested everything hush hush swept rug. Yup, little testing, long delays get results well.

In state live processing 200 tests per day population around 4 million people. Positivity rate well 80%. Nationwide bad much better, recently testing even less slow growth rate KEY POINTS

* Retail Industry Leaders Association wants U.S. governors make face masks mandatory
* association believes uniform rule prevent conflicts among shoppers retail workers
* Viral videos store workers customers arguing face masks appear online almost daily law. support Trump, believe wildly overblown, look statistic (statistic du jour currently declining death rate) cling evidence evil liberals overreacting make Trump look bad. I've read machines make fabric n95 masks specialized German manufacturer dies used machine said takes 6 months get one production. 2 sisters friends reunited city, spend entire 2 weeks vacation quarantine still together. maybe drive you? India ordered lockdown early on, think small success limiting initial spread. right India far behind testing capacity. I'm Vancouver Island, saw Florida plate two weeks ago. Zero reason here. BC Ferries stop them? Yes please. live close border keep locked ""I'm going Alaska"" bullshit. Btw Alaska great song Eyes Adrift. Them's funny talkin' words, mister! Prior Trump dedicated Republican. 2016 campaign lost faith party 2017 switched Democrat. EVERYTHING right scared Obama would take away rights praising Trump it. really can't support behavior sickening knowing many friends even family longer speak infatuation Trump. *I’m local* — Sunday, 7/5/2020, went 8 mile bike ride, 4 miles way.

Saw following out-of-state license plates: NEW YORK (already it), New Hampshire, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Vermont, Montana (1st time ever), Michigan, Illinois, California, Maryland, Pennsylvania, FLORIDA, North Carolina, probably make sure didn’t get hit. 

I get beautiful beaches next summer still come... see states offering. Day stays fun. careful read r/COVID19positive subreddit horror stories. many pass away family member friend take realize virus isn’t disappearing.

Sorry water salt water isn’t cure everything. supposed 3-4 weeks deaths spike. Considering average takes person pass Covid-19 least two weeks. see rejoicing death spike. tbh. Completely agree... US lost fucking mind. like Trump law.  care became sheriff.  role enforce law job.  Replace them, fire them, vote whatever.  need go .

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* post highly misleading then. whole thread topic removed. Vietnam public transportation may better Texas, that's it. really sure know didn’t get infected contact tracers instructed asks whether person protesting. get it’s sole reason increase cases, crowds massive. Also, mask aren’t guaranteed prevent spread, though think people definitely still wear them. act like care Muslims China actually know nothing them. Depends election. Hopefully get science focused policy makers pull New Zealand... happen degree I'll take anything what's going here.

In meantime I'm looking authentic poutine recipes. death spiral""...so dramatic. Americans already financial debt often even good reasons (new car, eating restaurants, vacations). Americans made habit living beyond means complaining bill comes due last 80 years. reiterate Americans could come $400 $500 dollars, would require sacrificing frivolous things. two classes people option: homeless monks taken vow poverty (both get free health care most, all, nonprofit hospitals, fyi). make clear, thing agree American justice system rife unfairness. completely disagree notion privilege due financial status, race creed. whole concept person financially rich afforded privilege governing body completely untrue idiotic. able weather consequences thing criminal immunity, whole point responses tried broaden argument justice system, whole.

There plenty people less zero wealth homeless. seen APR payday loans? Pawnshops tend even worse practice. always bad, attributing poor people irresponsible neglects fuckload structural factors. never brought criminal immunity, would clear delete comments getting response. think problems justice system pervasive [here also said poverty effect damage done speeding ticket. car sine qua non employment can't take $400 bill without putting deteriorating financial situation, protection stuff like speeding tickets, period. Gotta fill seats, collection plates don’t fill gotten point least concerns, unfortunately. We'll plenty time finding source then, seems there's much bigger things plate atm negative effects I’ve seen reported Oxford vaccine monkey trials gave far higher viral load person reasonably expect get, monkeys still didn’t get full-blown COVID. said Prosperity mean continuous economic growth Improvement like United States see standards living dropping. government continually improve standing life harder people justify removing government. median Chinese citizen still extremely poor making around $10 day. situation still improving much faster many countries. China one largest wage growth rates world 2.9% accounting inflation still worse many neighboring countries like Malaysia Thailand Taiwan.


My original point Chinese economic machine begins slow Chinese people stop tolerating bullshit Beijing. eyes many Chinese purpose government make sure things keep improving one sole threads legitimacy Chinese government people. voicemail broke never got around fixing it. realized life better without it. Canada dramatically different rates.in different provinces.

Quebec vs BC example like order magnitude so
 even then, get main city Vancouver BC, even per capita , much lower story again. told Trump homicidal dictator? Yeah, he's executing people stadiums cannons, impact necessarily dissimilar. agree well. Haven’t seen parents since Christmas, won’t meet brand new grandson anytime soon. two kids ask almost every day get see grandma grandpa. wish knew! sucks, know it’s best. every first world nation reined spread.

*Sweden says hi* Chris Evans (captain America) talk racism Asian Americans face (due “China Flu”) dispersed throughput America fall? I've apparently met people worse frat guys. Every time push towards total self suffiency isolation gone well  Nobody family medical doctor. There's legality dispensing controlled substances. So... nuclear war? Sounds like appropriate punishment liking Chilli's. never said started terrified.

I never said anything it. 

Been terrified since trump went golfing February didnt shit whole month.  article likely trash. So... comes rude. dense? wait lungs fully developed, tobacco healthy. keeps away ill-sick vapors many dangerous insects. Currently cases rising 31 50 states.

Source please, I'm looking seems 40 canada 19% crazies, US example country ~45% crazies one knows. Primary theories moment:

* Deaths lag hospitalizations, lag cases, going happen day now.
* Average age infected lowered, younger people much less likely die, spike cases lead deaths, wrong population.
* tests now, we're catching lot minor cases caught initial wave testing less available prioritized deathly ill.
* better handle procedures handle virus, led lower mortality.
* Hospitals time prepare, better able weather storm room conversions, contingency plans, etc.
* Early deaths northeast, particularly NYC, poor decisions resulted virus hitting elderly population disproportionately.

I think combination things (as think they're true), hard know explanatory power. Florida's approach virus focus lot attention nursing homes, keeping free virus much possible allowing virus spread without much impediment populations. That's exactly approach would expect result much higher cases much lower deaths. Good.

-Homer Simpson 5 100 die already. That's insane! Imagine working fairly typical office building 100 employees floor. come work next day find five coworkers died. extremely alarming unusual? wonder it’s brain gets deprived oxygen. already tested courts. absolutely constitutional. It’s super politicized naturally lot people try avoid political discussions. Actually that’s somewhat brilliant would politicized. parents nurse physicians assistant, clearly foresaw risk result. premeditated murder. case anyone wondering ICUs average 68% full. Interestingly, constant throughout year. individual hospitals average pretty wide I’m saying deaths delayed, like since beginning. 

But cannot ignore deaths 900 1 day 1 month. 1 month ago people saying uptick deaths coming are. said often long-term problems *among hospitalized survived*. Mild cases get hospitalized. 

They added sources. 

It's also found asymptomatic cases (hopefully temporary) lung damage. 10+ covid-positive people know, there's probably someone thinks they're fine whose lungs disagree.

Shitty situation around. Go Big Dead! Plot twist:

the virus targeting brains, making people dimwitted point can't comprehend utility masks precautions. virus specifically secure even fresh, juicy human bodies infect. Evidently, strains even evolved trigger humans' desire deliberately infect others means licking door knobs.

You sneaky little bastard you, COVID ;) gives hope.

I'm heartened lengths clearly taken researchers meta-researchers ensure rigorous standards integrity upheld despite unprecedented political pressures pushing directions particular study.  Kudos team part this, outstanding website makes dense medical literature layperson- accessible truly enticing read. Yeah, even try explain higher past weeks, they'll still persist. think already happening USA. :) lol, i’d literally run circles around every level I'm gonna go ""Hungry Hungry Hippo"" Yeah see quitting soon realizes kind challenge election futile. see pardon thing. service gene want see country along without anything 


definitely Russia thing though. way much pride that. 15 possible options list patients covid US, require positive covid test. US completely different ways counting cases countries, that's higher Deaths down. much shit. really, nothing compared almost 3 million deaths get every year causes. didn’t Trump cronies support him. rest us punished whole group. good bro 👍🏼 Yeah can’t fault Canada trying protect citizens. Hi. record saying stuff opened long hospitals danger overwhelmed. think mask mandated, can't lockdown year. Yes was.  Unless something people follow ways mitigate virus might well stop bothering try anything pandemic. None ever matter without full compliance EVERYONE. ...is Canada murder machine? 

so confused... Happy Cake Day! election results came started project rewrite transition materials crayon. Okay, fuck Ohio Republican state reps? state Republicans refused go Congress allow bill voted on, holed armed militia, threatened lives police sent get work? innocent question im sure get berated downvoted popular downplay hysteria but...  major increase positive cases anything fact testing drive thru testing locations town?  assume would major reason positive cases increasing.  numbers could even higher would known get tested unless deathbed drive Walmart CVS parking lot get tested.  Testing much larger percentage people would undoubtedly report larger numbers positives yes? Everything posted sub since February, GIYF. *sigh* going tell makes big deal? median age new cases 35. still, ICUs filling up. watch see deaths younger.

Even so, acting though people 40 pre-existing conditions expendable. Reporting weekends always delayed. 900 Tuesday hasn’t happened month.  can’t take gap year. universities approve gap year you’ve presented meaningful experiences plan partaking in. 

In words, gap years. mean sorry, looking like failed state every day. Name calling. intelligent places (or soon)...Aruba, Bahamas, example. require covid tests prior arrival. care discussing shameless lair. cover wants eventually truth come light . Ppl Florida dying bc 
This mans lies &amp; betrayal casino work destroyed cases. They've lost almost security cage workers ECT. remain open. typical hourly worker who's sacrificed, scary part get it, rather get it, long term effects?  Yes, always protect countryman first. save rest world. closing borders keeps even one citizen safe worth opinion. Lmao people subreddit man... Good see someone calling gibberish We've mandate month changed thing. Honestly makes wonder we're lying numbers too. They're relatively low yet masks worn much all. also entered phase 3. restaurants ran full capacity. 19% Canadians retarded. you’re dense like rock. dummy They've uploaded pdf file, server now.

 That's abbreviation. There's always new number exalt others long americans refugees? fill water. Or... liquid might trick. work hotels would nightmare staff. :( hate sound selfish since LOT people deal simply equipped trained. Hmm saying earlier asking quote called stunted emotional development really enjoyed facts shared thread, providing zero sources all. *so* insightful. whole point prioritizing nursing homes that’s vulnerable population. can’t prioritize everything, definition.

Let young/healthy get get it, like happening now. big change. cases people 20 30 range death rate drop. thanks DT. Improved treatments, New treatments, New medicine. thing contribute less death. thanks DT. Recycling earlier post made :)

Where F....ing mask Good point man keep going That’s herd want grazing with. wish true, personally believe idealistic. I'd assume many people thread subscribed subreddit named r/Coronavirus, makes many us bit biased. COVID maximalists, speak. 

I'm constantly sending brother terrifying findings regarding virus. always send reputable sources, course. always responds, ""oh man, that's terrible."" goes dates gets physically intimate women, always wear mask around people, take disinfecting/sanitizing home belongings seriously. one example. friends, hand, also well-educated professionals. Millennials. Guess what? They're even worse. send links well, respond ""that's terrible,"" well. go party indoors without masks on, go restaurants, barbers, etc.

These anecdotal references. good demonstration people simply ""anti-science bias,"" Fauci calls it. I'd assume there's lot money urgency find cure corona HIV Since Germany less diverse, ignorant racism towards asians less people going speak Til 9% Canadian population literally toddler really downplaying 130k people dead?

Really? 130k?

No biggie, right? friends good (for now) 130k dead Americans, fine.

Really? Ha! think heard somewhere 48th country? many many **many** posts like show hopeful treatments COVID. 1 doesn’t get 10k upvotes doesn’t mean subreddit doesn’t care, many posts sound hopeful. No, dont believe border wall mexico america racist little bit overkill. true, assumed richer, better educated countries able control better. Richer quite important here, lockdown people need paid without working, usually government pick bill. Health Department administered county level, city level

Same California. Yes, thats fucked up. admit talked ""America"" whole negative way. comes political standpoint president, Heath care Karens. difference tackled. 
Whats fucked making parallel Americans idiots, simply possible true. Sweden/Swedish ppl.  “Thank service” ass, people don’t give shit veterans country. methods, ideas, rationale questioned perceived personal attack. know put forth good argument easily answer questions provide evidence support them. know there's person behind username agree person good help stay informed, there's better way going it. website? what's going here? Grandma? FERME LA PORTE ! it’s worth, director CDC recently said 10x number reported cases nationwide well. republican way, keep constituency poor uneducated... completely agree. 


It nice entire world go along Biden conspiracy. Covid thing keeping hospitals afloat. get that? surgury rooms closed people afraid go hospital, covid source income have. blows mind can't figure .

Nurses already proven fact, coming forward whistleblowers want clear things real quick. 

The numbers seeing new hospitalizations deaths aren’t lagging far behind new confirmed cases that’s extreme delay testing. 

Florida doesn’t restrictions testing, including fee. result, everyone even slightest tickle throat get test. caused wait appointment increase two weeks, another 5-7 day turn around results. means felt sick right now, wouldn’t able confirm covid *three weeks*. 

So yeah, pay way attention new hospitalizations, went staggering 380 today. could US Yes exactly like holocaust 🙄 No, really isnt.  way wasn‘t going go today. came back 3 day weekend. weekend 7 day avg dropped artifically, due actual decrease, it‘s catching back up. 19% Canadians lacks common sense, that's pretty good number compared US. Millions losing jobs

Unemployment Denmark currently ~160000 people. lockdown Unemployment 100000 people. change 60000 people.

Meanwhile Swedish unemployment numbers also risen due swedish population (and rest world) spending less money.

The lockdown tough yes. Also mentally. unemployment main issue most.

The mental gymnastic needed go work risking infection must also taxing? Build wall make Trump pay Totally numb. Went store today pick furniture curbside packed, completely wall wall people walking around, masks, nothing. Insanity. I'm sure places currently lagging behind, originally beginning this. No, it’s bad. terrible decision. Fuck united states infection. course can't monetize it, softbank $1b funding you. /s Dude, unless show proof medical degree immunology epidemiology, guarantee qualified make assertions.

You certainly qualified assert massive conspiracy zero proof hundreds hospitals, collusion health organizations *worldwide* conspiring ... I'm never really sure end.goal people claim is, changes hour yes, average redditor dumb american. less dumb. upvote shit sees political giving Joe Biden big advantage Trump that’s convenient him. wasn’t happening election year, denials excuses wouldn’t intense. know joke, really see anyone saying quite people (in Canada) think what's happening states wrong bad media blowing things proportion. I’m American—it Countdown needs sue him. state enforce legal right.

They claim cost cleaning, operating costs, loss profit days closed.  Wait two weeks. &amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

but dumb third grader count empty beds.

&amp;#x200B;

Nearly 84% Florida's ICU beds filled amid rising coronavirus sure accurate count negatives urgent positives high, beds left.

&amp;#x200B;

changing battery smoke detector, garage fire?

brilliant. said. wanted us get it. Can’t blame them. wouldn’t let us either huge jump partly due LA County, roughly half new cases, reporting consistently last days. number “catch up”. Due kinds anomalies lower reporting weekends, 7 day averages much useful trend spotting imho. virus, lockdown causing mental health crises.

By way, Indians highly concentrated dormitories Singapore well. fatalities, 40 000 worker (but countries) got infected. poverty. Yeah, wealthy people already wealthy life started tend leave part out. yet fathers auto shop couldn’t get one. fuck country Can’t say anything China Yep...sucks sure. taken substantial pay cuts along friends lost jobs. Seeing numbers really deep cut comment age well lol get Americans cross border anywhere country claim going Alaska. Make bulk drive country ffs, cross Washington border BC head north. Anyone trying claim they're traveling Anchorage via Quebec needs sent packing. fashion trend everyone it, people realising america really isnt good country. According [German Wikipedia link two discarded 2001, since strains Influenca-RNA probes found. Clarify? think need remember death rate single function. exceed ICU capacity, get entirely new considerably higher death rate. Since starting reach level new hotspots, likely seeing surge quite yet. someone Windsor ambassador bridge busiest international border world (yea know lost transport trucks) please keep closed.

I don’t mind 19/20 year olds crossing legally drink normal times shot shit ton Americans isn’t time likely won’t while. always choice. 

No tears landlords. volunteering pay rent then? Stay safe peoples USA....round 2 seem here, take care. Social distancing mask love God.
Not peoples around you. Stay strong. remember days could tell sarcasm agree. wish saw something could happen US. probably won't. 

Maybe EU, someday. think start reporting things way:

Number active cases:

Number full recoveries:

Number recoveries organ damage:

Number ICU:

Number ventilators:

Number deaths: Paying wall looks really convincing Mexico.... seriously never occur people masks around forever people used extended periods issues whatsoever? grow numb numbers. Continue taking precautions, continue wearing masks! makes upset. actually wants data scientist, like guy believe science I'm racist, but... agree. U.S. sucks 

FYFY

Seriously, vast majority people (read: rich) U.S. absolutely bottom 2nd world barrel. 

If means, get can. It‘s even close 30-40 days, keep talking bullshit. actual hell.

In country Australia, returned travellers abroad forced 2 weeks mandatory hotel quarantine. Thanks clarifying. US/Mexico border wall racist? American, yes, build wall! old AOL CDs, scratched DVDs, Blu Rays, etc. Bales PET pop bottles Asian countries wont take. Dead ash trees killed borers, dead blackberry vines, expired Gen 1-Gen 5 consoles, old beige box PCs. Vancouver International Falls. It'll lasting monument ""Meh, screw guys! attitudes we've cultivating since 80s. Unfortunately, virus hitting POC color hardest everywhere. Mostly co-morbidities. Doctors agree. even posted link doctor. video showed testing criteria directly government. freely available information verify yourself. would need scientific paper CDC states right criteria? call conspiracy theorist, why? know you? Lol. Seems default rebuttal days someone can't handle facts contradicts opinion Alternate Headline:

99% Florida Residents Covid Free American agree, keep shut. making sure many people survive possible. many dummies want us pay mistakes. Stay safe, stay alive.

Also, whole episode gives new meaning Canadian song ""American Woman."" 1/4th number hospital beds per capita well. There's things huge last weeks. Like fact produces Antibody levels *over* level natural COVID infect. that, news Astra Serum Institute India going soon 2.5-3 billion units ready go. nothing short revolutionary. absolutely incredible. ""Failing cope"" probably accurate assessment. He's good guy butt heads anything political. unfortunate become partisan issue. True, outbreaks stopped risk never went away. Lack foresight scale back research efforts. No, actually didnt prove point. ignored points wished there. 

Once again, everything reimbursement rate from.health insurance companies. around decades. again, companies use Medicare rare, happened decades. 

You, infinite delusion, somehow think hospitals profiting manufacturing health crisis. Even claim laying people, mind, contradiction exist.

Again, points:

Hospitals making money
Hospitals going broke laying people off

These make sense crazy people American, agree. live well known city/area basically everyone complies rules. drive 50 miles direction, aka country, opinions flipped hoax freedoms taken away. job, trying ship things India, intercompany equipment. Shipping never easy seems impossible. get political used able ship things Canada ease ever since Trump pissed years ago, bend backwards get approval even shipment ink pens. Good them. can't even trust slightest.  read ship supposed non-covid patients almost everyone needing ER tested positive. switched accepting Covid patients. still 200 patients. Doesn‘t change fact mean time symptom onset death 14 days +- 7 SD. 4 6 weeks simply wrong 95 % deaths. post Asian Americans.

You post think people Asia racist.

I respond Asian Americans may different mindsets. doesn’t mean Asian Americans can’t racist. culturally different doesn’t explain think racism comes natural Asian people.

You one making broad offensive stereotypes. I’m even defending anyone, pointing you’re saying offensive. like seatbelt - reduces risk, people wearing seatbelts still die car crashes.  transmission already well known back February China, I'm sure people making big deal now. recall phase ""number's game"" clearly recall read though. Even year, that's different already flu shot Mask compliance area 99-1 favor wearing mask, keep strong public health compliance think avoid major spike keep college outbreaks small Needs good news flair. guess going herd immunity? fails, going spectacularly backfire know political angle is. Republican convention win Yeah problem desperately wanted tourism dollars back rammed opening almost certainly doomed tourism industry. honestly whole pandemic shown badly prepared state governments emergencies like this-the federal government endlessly print money spend state governments basically go broke instantly since nobody real reserves. Honestly, states like year's worth reserve keep things going could controlled properly instead batshit insane things still wreck economy long term anyway. many times week guys think “fuck hope don’t covid” Hi there, already posted small companies really big threats? don’t think big company would take big hit eliminate small companies won’t really big threat. Also talking Covid 19, companies aren’t big story. don’t think ones reporting numbers. China took control via soft power. Modern America dumb solve problems except bigger stick. That's dynamics play here... It’s like two party system. doesn’t make sense 100 different groups play individuals. Similar thinking groups partner consolidate power. giving America + EU’s lead world stage, give way possibility China Russian joining together groups influence. report Oxford said death rates hospitalised patients UK 1/4 April. fear hospitals get overwhelmed again, lose gains made past months. Patients can't benefit improvements care cannot get hospital. Black person told ""Go back Africa."" Also, Black immigrants exist make large majority Black population communities South Florida certain boroughs New York City. 

Black immigrants also same, ""Go back country."", ""Where from?"", "" exotic."" ""Do speak English?"" comments questions thrown them. way recent, perceived, immigrants treated country horrible, especially Non-White immigrants. It’s easier request masks shut labor Still better US playground China pay room food, along test. hotel rooms filthy gross. Since schools start August ""The combined number COVID-19-related deaths recorded states past month greater total hurricane-related deaths reported U.S. past 20 years.""

Oof, combined number still 5x less New York's tally.  better pay cash, right? mom’s story reminds something. good friend mine real beef doctors general misdiagnosis factored mom’s death. he’s biased hell, still said something wise: “doctors tech support body.” 

As kind tech support, good outcome gotta pay attention, ask questions, involved. 

I’ve various human animal medical catastrophes family member once, best doctor know, could switch brain blindly follow instructions perfect safety. wont work west enemies. Meaning decimate economy three months eradicate virus enemies bring back ease. Keep closed!!!! I'm getting Jojo ride. can't find voting either major candidate implies educated begin honestly made realize much wish tried harder meet partner. that's nearly impossible likely continue next couple years minimum. microburst cavitation lungs would gnarly. reason actually sinister sounds.

The objective: Let organ transplant go waste.

To achieve this: organ recipient must live highly regulated life rather severe restrictions medications. person needs able 100% follow orders prove follow post-op medical requirements.

Edit: grammar check Lmao, hilarious Arizona inundated cases

Besides glamis, Imperial County isnt exactly vacation heaven. think putting far much emphasis Arizona's ignorant people keep blaming Mexico

Do live area/Are familiar area? blaming Mexico, reality people economy area work. 
Tons US citizens live Mexicali cross border daily work US. Retail, offices, agriculture, big box stores, name it. 

Just random example get idea, went Jr high there. people knew least quarter either, Lived Mexicali borrowing someone's address enroll kids US schools would cross daily, house/apartment would school week go back Mexicali weekends, 

Plus Mexicali huge population, surpasses imperial county, Mexicali really, really bad regarding cases. keep close eye business interests there.

From perspective opinion far ignorant mine. Really? Arizona that's causing spikes nothing-tofucking-do imperial county?

Who wouldnt want visit amazing cities Calexico, El Centro, Brawley, Calipatria. traffic Arizonans killing come beautiful sites imperial valley offer. Bother little bit research calling people ignorant think people solely blaming Mexico. (Which done completely shit job at),because what? sort racism shit? Eh know trying smug, looking update China since ""two months"" ahead us. instance, go second wave two months ago? kind things implemented slow virus? Thank god we’re opening Disney back up!!

Misleading title article otherwise confirms already knew.

US governors repeatedly lied virus, twisted data support reopening, suppressed whistleblowers pointing terribly US handling things. Begins? STILL 8 n95 masks March. forgive persons responsible this. makes think that? provide insight this? I’m legitimately curious reporting deaths-I understand positive test results backlogged weekend deaths tallied? test performed deceased postmortem coroner need check deceased positive result recent point? hand Batch, Gun, Keys over? problem uncertainty. never know sure life depends it, bet. evacuate really can't afford it, definitely losing money even paying potentially steep cost it. 

Let's say there's situation there's 10% chance total disaster death specific location. Evacuation orders given. smart stay, people decide roll dice 90% chance they'll fine suffer hardship evacuating could cause, rather suffer evacuating to. 

I'm saying that's right decision, people know SURE lives depend it. decided become nurse now. going risk life people decide want wear mask believe  hoax. one supports Black Lives Matter saying that. people think there's invisible ""only"" beginning statement can't exist outside made binary ""if matters must not.""

The invisible word lot racists see Black Lives Matter ""Too.""

You're making think backlash original germ theory discoveries, mothers dying childbirth soldiers minor wounds doctors refused wash hands. 

What makes acceptance/belief *threatening* ? attention people. local airtest showing uptick covid virus. probably get tested stay away elderly. sound familiar.....? Maybe divert masks going bullshit like casinos people actually need them, etc.? true, could look US cause mortality see lower number average deaths plus number COVID deaths. However, there's 150,000 deaths average year, there's 130,000 deaths confirmed due COVID. There's pretty wide margin average deaths though, conclusive proof death count undercount, definitely provide evidence direction, 80% many coronavirus epidemics COVID-19: (a) infection fatality rate measurably greater zero; (b) infected several thousand people entire world; (c) occurred within time period humans knew existence viruses technology develop vaccines.

(Easy quiz) heard goes far tickles butt hole think see writing wall they’re rooting it?? It’s pretty simple cases hospitalizations (we’re here) deaths.

The sick ones people like trying normalize mass deaths. 9/11 worth victims dying every day bitching masks lockdowns. 

If don’t act get ahead literally tens thousands Americans needlessly die, hundreds thousands fucked bankrupt, millions jobs. yeah let’s “Calm down” hope goes away, that’s sick. question gets answered asked next thread somehow answer magically changed. Yes. I've taken shelter basement dozens times tornado gone head. can't blame you. Neither blame Teachers probably going retire rather risk it. bit worried dumbass actually withdraw NATO.

Maybe October 7, birthday present best buddy, Vlad.

I already see it: plays fact Europe closed borders US coronavirus, uses reason pull NATO. Something along lines ""if want us there, want protection"".

After happens, wonder long Putin wait annexing Ukraine, taking Baltics, Finland, Moldova annexing Belarus. Ukraine probably fully annexed end 2021, Lukashenko suffer sudden health problem (just get near Geiger counter) ""in order ensure stability country security citizens"" Russia annex it.

He's 10 points right sign moving up. big deal.

That’s enough. Thank you. Google box it! places did. yeah awful now. Already blew wad first 2 months, wasted. ember ember there. go Disney Applebees Arby's casinos. virus like there.

About month deaths stop rising.

It's shame rural county town look devil eye believe him, seems are.

So. Cases deaths continue rise quite while. county village hits quota masks up, deaths die grows places hit limit yet. eventually get point everyone seen devil close enough conform necessary behavior changes. stay everyone gets safe effective vaccine - probably never.

It never gets bad theoretically could people eventually mitigate. It’s overarching, sound, policy making pushed us top. many nobody knows yet.

If 1 person gets sick place business multiple will. likely get tests around time employees contacted individually saying theyve exposed get test etc.

even 1 person comes symptoms doesnt mean vector. thought people understood now. it! Nation wide mail-ins. 1. one gives fuck nursing homes elderly.  virus affecting younger people ever.
2. Treatment means fuck without proper staffing hospitals overrun.  week many ICUs overflowing.
3. elderly people dying. Seriously shut fuck bullshit. math isn’t off, assumed death rate poor assumption Arizona older population off. median age population Arizona 38, also happens median age United States.

Covid death rates vary significantly age aren’t posting age data daily cases reason assume people getting Covid old people. fact problem is, official case data skews older ones seeking care getting tested younger people carry spread mild symptoms aren’t tested.

The mortality rate widely variable age, total mortality rate ages something less 1%, fact likely less .5% that’s hard certain people buy they’ve lied don’t understand numbers well. 

The fact is, virus far contagious people realize, far widespread, quite deadly originally believed. math used death rate 0.55%. honest it’s shot dark, mortality rate continues revised I’m mostly seeing predictions .6% way low .25%. best cheese ‘squeak’ cheese curds

It’s getting really bad SoCal young people still partying. think face reality soon though, unfortunately 😔 Asking percentage Central Florida Disney employs may bit telling since majority people, included, commute Orlando counties surrounding Disney. Disney also contracts bunch businesses corporations, including healthcare conglomerate enslaves me.


Even though hotels restaurants directly owned Disney, absolutely dependent tourists Disney attractions bring. attractions go down, major hotels, restaurants, gift shops, transportation services, realtors. Tourists worker's comp make good chunk patient population hospitals too. Ever seen Disney Pavillion AdventHealth Children's Hospital? insane. 


It's near impossible completely Disney's influence live Central Florida. whole enslaved rodent one way another, driving near I-4. There's like 6 exits go different parts Disney. *Just* Disney. comparison, Universal Studios Sea World like 1 exit each. shudder thinking highway hell.

Shouldn't get tested regularly? Ah, yes, old “shutdown thee me” approach. what's news? Another zero-evidence conjecture.  Please realize say they’re “representing Target Home Depot” probably *lobby* group. 

That’s fine. reason they’re urging governors make masks mandatory report Goldman Sachs last week. didn’t care anyone’s health realized mask mandates could prevent 5% downturn economy (and therefore, profits).

Lobbyist groups like reacting GS report reason states gotten stricter masks past week. 

I’d willing bet literally threatening withdraw campaign funding governor impose mask mandate. definitely sane one crazy rise counts. least seem supportive husband. use advantage stay safe. serious note

Why can’t trump call war ships like peak again?

I’m even trolling thought discovered encephalitis lethargica likely caused enterovirus substantial link H1N1 pandemic. DPRK banned foreign tourists entering country indefinitely January 22, yet lift ban used HCQ several months now... parents still giving June. *probably* blame Trump's insinuation HCQ's miracle drug. link provided says nothing virus spread cash / credit cards. 
🤦🏼‍♂️  Um...what currently happening south ""off rails""? Seriously? Upvote pitch black comedy. bruh That's fine. got zoom Skype hangouts shit like that. backlog weekend = 1000+ dead.


God depressing goalpost defense. Especially remember nations like Vietnam Argentina completely avoided horrific death toll really sucks. awesome!!! People saying things like months yet numbers keep going down.  Best cast scenario means fuck people refuse wear masks social distance. do! want stay home wear mask must go - like everyone else. beyond sad. remember company replaced one workers 1099s, shocked. zero employment rights. many laws protect employees 0.0 1099 contractor moron Facebook friend mine ER nurse. Still regularly posts photos people house her. Time exposure symptom onset: 6 days (mean)

Mean number days symptom onset death (standard deviation): 0-49 years: 14.9 (7.7) days


Mean number days mechanical ventilation (standard deviation): Overall: 5.5 (5.3) NY overwhelmed early could test high-risk people. something like 50% positive rate early stages. could give ""housing vouchers"" facilitate transfer wealth public coffers private landlords, sure. 

Or could use power imminent domain claim empty domiciles - like transform public housing, owned people. Spot Agreed. Lock down. agree Canada, keep us get shit together. 2-month lockdown resulted least reduction (as America), India, kept growing Indians care enough Indians order follow rules. 

Lockdown going reduce spread unless curfew level. buy time prepare better healthcare help spread curve. see can't get basic stuff like this, shit people idea about. Indian government finally recognized Indian people going adhere sort restriction meaningful way, stopped trying contain it. There's point crushing economy exponential case growth. So, recognizing India skews young, decided unofficially ""give up"" strict containment go back work.

Because country keep sitting inside houses worry Covid likely stay us while. Wear masks, take precautions get back current Indian strategy minimize deaths waiting vaccine released Aug 15, Indian Independence Day.

Absolutely source strategy minimize deaths. Vaccine thing looks PR stunt nevertheless. Fig 3C looks change RHR relative baseline. It’s severe, I’d say average maybe 10bpm increase. One biggest challenges overcome personalizing algorithms participants baseline, we’re catching extreme spikes sustained rise residuals. It’s definition personalized medicine, two people’s hearts beat spike way individually tuned. post read article got source it, blog post whistleblower: 

[Rebekah Jones hero blog got [the coroner's chilling because

- parents made kid attend event 10th June fully aware rish **The parents prophylactically treated azithromycin (6/10-6/15).**

- 13th June **she developed frontal headache, sinus pressure, mild cough. family thought symptoms due sinus infection**

- remained untreated suspected sinus infection symptoms 6 fucking days **On June 19, mother noted looked ""gray"" sleeping**. date observed abysmal 40% oxygen degree saturation. realize means found post Quora:

**At 40% pulse ox oxygen level person would likely comatose around 60% stroke zone can't get 100% without pure oxygen given chronic pulmonary diseases like COPD chronic bronchitis 40% believe I've ever seen anybody 40% I've patients CPR higher 40% would severe respiratory acidosis would likely brain damage lived severe severe hypoxia.**

So loving parents decided put grandpa's oxygen, give dose ""stupid cure"" ship ER. got there, refused intubation fuck not, grandpa's oxygen enough get 60%.

I'm glossing high LFT values mean. would probably make scared shitless.

- agonized two days loving parents decide worthy intubation last day life.

- icing cake: ** mother requested heroic efforts despite knowing low chance meaningful survival. Preparations made perform ECMO decedent.** nerve death-cult people amazing. I'm surprised try make someone corona storyline probably right. thought opened restaurants infection rate down. Again, social cohesion thing farce. That's wonderful wife immigrated South Korea. live South Korea. cafes restaurants around hundreds people wearing masks. People wear masks mainly outside, reason take off, off.

What saying mystical ""societal cohesion"" everyone points to, simply result effective government leadership, trust science epidemiology, decisive mandates, coordinated action. planning epidemic years utilized science &amp; technology drive response. lead mandates social distancing, mask usage, etc. people complied either mandated effectively communicated governing authorities, ""we together"" attitude. Looking across world, also find countries (France, Spain, Italy, etc) states (Massachusetts, New York) enacted enforced mandates containment strategies able lower transmission virus. states suffering.

It comes leadership end. US failed leadership. Car crashes price pay neither Amish future. voting party, man. Terrence Phillip said best. motivated money saving? US tested country mile.  world laughing you. Isn’t racist something know, ""moose"" plural version ""moose"", exact same. think thinking ""goose"" ""geese"" :) repeatedly claiming vast majority cases asymptomatic? think anybody dumbest people listen ignore science? 

The highest percent I’ve ever seen asymptomatic estimates 30%. Something like 20-25% end severely ill hospital. even greater percent sick weeks/months getting better due post-viral syndrome doctors can’t figure out. 

Don’t downplay thing. Cool. Yes that's true may cause issues hope return US long term, decent proportion goal, least graduate level. 60% loan goes payroll payroll expenses staff 24 week period records show pre COVID roster 24 week period emp name, rate, hours etc.... also restrictions employees making $100k

The 40% spent approved expenses limited rent, mortgage, leased equipment, utilities. also spent 24 weeks.  


Anything meeting outside gets paid back loan. probably troll China literally opposite: mandatory mass-testing quick &amp; decisive Lt. Governor Dan Patrick coward. happened willingness sacrifice greater good economy? guess juveniles. Canada, particularly Ontario Quebec, dropped ball hard respect elderly care homes. homes ravaged virus majority deaths. Elderly Canadians overrepresented death count relative countries reason.  Political reality. 

He’s wimp. 

I’d bet . second this. You’re wrong.. would take ages. You’d vaccine meds help recover time hit numbers. Pointless losses achieve something won’t needed Yeah herd immunity could reached without vaccine Florida prove one way another rate going. parents traveled Ontario Nova Scotia Cape Breton every summer since mid 60s. first year (that recall) haven't. Rookie numbers trying kill us. lived Ohio I’d get NJ Devils mask. compared US they've done phenomenal job. 403 known active cases China. 7 US states higher death toll China. Florida's active cases alone twice number total known cases China since beginning. Fast tracking seems like recipe disaster. stat working defense number years back. 2018 American military military budget per annum next 26 countries combined...

Let sink in.

All day, erryday.  going take really long time. I'm ICU nurse working covid ICU one patients 60 days now. Obviously everyone different far experience people who've made sick stayed least month. I'm talking making ICU, even making home rehab facility. NO, HIV disease ever clear. That's terrible example. can't HIV herd immunity, that's disease lead inevitable death untreated. can't herd immunity HIV, syphillis, etc.

It's ACTUALLY like saying ""if healthy young kids catch chicken pox young, protect people immune system issues exposed adults"". exactly chicken pox vaccine.

Our first smallpox vaccine catching cowpox, much much much milder sibling. two concepts intimately related, **many modern vaccines virus ""on deathbead"" intentionally infect with.** Sheriffs elected aren’t they? least places are. swear oath also answer voters.

SF 30-60 day, outside blips there

We mostly mask
No open bars
No gyms
No indoor dining

Not hard. Oh. Thought recently opened closed. bad. smart. Glad postponed it. know it’s since I’ve school remember COUNTLESS numbers people working school age 50. Janitorial, cafeteria, office support staff, principal. course least half 50. Didn’t matter school. college matter. 

And want put firing line? time teachers union start flexing now. Well international laws require country act responsibly situations. course, shit happens, China actually tried silence doctors speaking virus. 

That punished international court somehow. essentially quarantine  thought hurricane season kicked off, scary thought... I'm Florida anymore big one hits anywhere along gulf east coast, country possibly provide resources assistance hospitals already struggling, finances already tapped? really hope mild season! Gosh, do.. Hm wonder Zoomers dying rare cancer 40 ... infections up.

We getting better treating people getting infected makes numbers go even death rate going I've asked manager (at restaurant) plan ""hope everyone get sick once,"" know. I've asked manager exactly happens someone tests positive COVID. person asked stay home, everyone interacted person stays home too, multiple cafes across multiple cities going shut down. then?

Do us healthy cover stores without bakers? know. two stores come sick time, cook giant bakes one location drive around? know. plan we're supposed considering national plan pretend pandemic exist?

He know.

We're fucked. Well deserved Nobel Prize 🥇 Yikes! ever like blood issues? ""way past Italian"" levels garlic make blood thin. freelance English teachers got hit really hard crisis, work dried instantly. It'll bounce back till virus gone. really true. Deaths don’t start rising weeks cases start spiking. Also, mostly young people infected take weeks cases work older population. Arizona takes week get results back test, even healthcare workers. That’s long time effectively control thing. FEMA rejected request help testing. problem, thanks interest. Honestly totally normal part routine even though I'm waking still sleep hungry fatigued, I'm sleeping 7-8 hours night instead 10-14 used I've gone feeling like came anaesthesia day noticeably drowsy time. I'll take improvement day :)

I think ironic myself, never liked drinking tried weed handful times. somehow ended experience controlled substances people know haha Actually did, since Friday 27 deaths, 6.5 day, makes 2% deaths normal day, around 250.


Ofc we're also half way immunity, fear second wave cooler fall weather low. china excluded? would mention friends asian? Dude difference quality life asians Brazil, Argentina. Nova Scotian personally thank sacrifice. assure plenty overprice seafood tacky tourist traps whenever eventually returned! Even person isn’t coming covid, test shows possibly coming something still may help. example, someone low risk contracting covid might less concerned data someone like works healthcare may use data reason get tested sooner. Isn’t reopening halt? I’m LA isn’t damn thing do. Outside dining 50% i'll take two surprisingly low number... Thank you, found trial near emailed it. I'll search though. think there's shortage trials. funny joke. Unclench. fatalities really start. DeSantis gonna work overtime get covered up. imagine post-2016 Google. used live district still Congressman confronted directly one visits back. ended town hall meeting early result left great uproar. Believe want don't. Nancy Pelosi also list kickbacks well couple Republicans. Becerra Congressman time that's name specifically engrained memory. Yeah, people get infected die may incur large amount medical bills can't pay, would start chain reaction delinquencies payment debts bills. cases, bigger pool people situation, would sum American economy then; lots people lost losing lots money, unpaid healthcare workers going strike, getting different job pay *their* bills. 

I wonder percentage recoveries serious medical problems infected? Well don’t test would know positive negative. Keyword found yes? it’s still 1 case found. It’s huge jump what’s around usually. don’t understand sub anymore. Negativity upon negativity. dad's childhood friend came US time. years hard work, he's become MD teaches gross anatomy classes. since come believe racist stereotypes blacks Hispanics, they're lazy moochers welfare queens hardworking taxpayers like support. Whoops lol Hahahahaha There's nothing wrong patriotic, sometimes gotta admit botched up. Numbers trending upwards since holiday weekend zero sign changing. Go Oxford go! They'll never find me. I'm hiding nursing home. Hihihihi wait independence day infections roll in. forget, US still systematically undercounting deaths well, evidenced excess death studies. I'm States agree. problem large chunk individuals COVID don’t know it. someone goes arm surgery non-COVID hospital, passes surgeon, passes colleagues, pass patients. Boom it’s another COVID hospital. ones survive win war get write history living Japan non-Japanese, seeing China treated African people evicting also blaming Covid Africans, seeing Asian Americans USA, yeah, Asians racist like every race, also normalized society. 

There laws place protect races. Living Japan able get credit card get apartment want I'm foreigner, restaurants also able put ""No Foreigners"" without repercussions, Japan proclaiming speaking English spreads coronavirus, seeing foreigners fleeing China...There legal repercussion discrimination foreigners Asian countries. I've warned even someone hits Japan fight back police automatically blame foreigner.
It's way life Asian countries. Foreigners fucking rights. can't even leave Japan without getting back country even though working visa. Japan G7 country (and Asian country, gasp) foreigners. 

Racism normalized Asia point people talk even care anything it. I'm saying USA perfect, least fucking conversation racism happening. Simple: Mandatory masks $100 fines. Pandemic solved. Look Taiwan Korea. time come. Execute Order Pandemic. really important point Jones person labeled ""COVID Party"". church host ""COVID Party"". girl intentionally brought children's event church, that's certain. way Jones words exposé girl extremely reckless. figured probably wasn’t case thought, “but didn’t inform him?” did. wish didn’t go that. Thanks explanation. That's schools districts plan. basically given set guidelines told figure out, guidelines Logistically impossible implement. one solution limits. point seems there's ongoing misinformation campaign foreign agents reddit trying make seem like virus originated US keep mind reading posts like this. 

While true exact origin virus may never known may China, China remains number one suspect list based know.  Hola Amigos. Perhaps could discuss common conspiracy theories seen social media negate facts? mean seems like everyone talk opinions vaccines, research time, profits treatment diagnosis, herd immunity, true infection, etc.

""Americans always trusted right thing, possibilities exhausted.""

-- Winston Churchill.

Don't worry, possibilities starting run out. realize covid causes pneumonia kills people right? Nobody dies covid directly, say zero deaths? Wake sheep TELL US ELSE HAPPENING Nice! servitude them! - one party. actually vector people think vector. actual science person exposed office. employees management perceive it.

I could see turning game chicken - hoping someone else first call sick respond contact tracers they'll ones face repercussions everyone else thinking brought in. Couple fact management workplace already trying hard possible let people work remote something likely type person understand science got recipe legit concerns might weigh possibility losing job cooperating contact tracing efforts.

And again, trying disparage contact tracing. necessary. complete lack job security 99% jobs US problem. sad thing , war tool.... People like cases spiking. step right direction comparing countries Covid deaths/capita rates meaningless. statistics likely completely wrong different countries use different definitions ""Covid deaths"" different reporting month start saying thing child's teachers school secretary cafeteria workers too.

We're fucked. weekend 7 days long? 7-day moving average increasing. never bothered learn, making goes. frightening reality painted us. wish Royal Highness would put plans place inevitable storms. many variables situation us aren’t even anticipating. Since resident Florida would think would least show concern impending hurricane season. grown hate man. get maze, need hug left. taste..

This thing pretty much factories swva. Even northeast Tennessee facing crisis.

What's hiring area? Well here's list.

Pizza Hut 
Domino's

Guess much make 3 those? 

$8.25 tops. US, goal never eliminate virus. “Flattening curve” meant prevent hospitals overwhelmed once. far, NYC place hospitals truly got overwhelmed, thankfully relatively short period. Arizona, Texas, Florida next. believe hospitals overwhelmed next 2-3 weeks, unfortunately. 

I think would better goal preventing spread. “Flattening curve” good goal have, IMO, knowing loosey-goosey Americans average rules, social consciousness, basic scientific understanding, least pretended goal prevent spread achieve real goal flattening curve. think that's good choice, current option right going lead universal health care. saying Chinese people receiving abuse? brain religion easy. Millions jobs disappeared millions people work also job market.

Also, quit lose health insurance. exactly great move either pandemic.

I trying get job teaching abroad teaching English. search actually going pretty great track make move...pretty much opportunities dried control things gotten nearly everyone travel bans us.

I want go back either. also want homeless, unemployed, without health insurance *and still* get virus. Hugely agree. Every time may point something may may true - there’s real hard evidence get downvoted. It’s like want coronavirus impossible handle situation worse possible. Europe shows stick it, bring cases down. Sweden succeeded much better US China example. 
In US number deaths staggering, don’t leader cares.

In China, country responsible spread, people silenced government spoke openly new Giesecke hired consultant health authorities March/April. 

He even billed tv interviews. testing result cases found (which are). best thing look positivity rates - percentage people tested positive. goes means increase cases real it’s getting worse. goes that’s good. Unfortunately many states it’s going up. Welcome real world, jackass! family cottage Manitoulin 50 years. first year single person family make up.

That’s small enough that, brief encounter someone else, moderate distance means particles likely able persist long enough far enough potentially reach you, rate duration exposure small, risk low.

With poor ventilation, though, may small proportion small microdroplets linger air longer may able accumulate, duration exposure might longer, letting overall concentration increase time exposure accumulate time.

IE, imagine fart per minute outdoors socially distanced crowd hours. many people would notice? Open air might make would get whiff. imagine farting per minute hours small room poorly ventilated room handful people still socially distanced.

Link goes wrong article... I'm feeling far depressed lockdown area, fear virus potentially return work 100x higher lockdown... Reno + Atlantic City + Mobile = Florida, then? Sure that's 100 countries. That's two countries economic alliance. Dont vaccines take years make test? 

How know won’t get horrible side effects 10 years?  

Are willing give everyone hope? many come school resumes fall. First, think moment might recommend hand washing immediately. cost associated hand washing? much. know washing hands good thing whether middle pandemic not. virtually way advice wash hands going negative consequences. interventions steep cost associated. special ed students? mom teacher almost spat drink asked thought chance they’d able social distance keep masks day. mention self aware enough self screen? Sure parents check fevers pay attention cough, many symptoms require certain self awareness many special ed children simply don’t have. Plus, kids less likely symptoms anyway. 

People also don’t seem realize cycle infection exacerbated considering kids likely go school children people must work in-person, can’t watch children work time, can’t afford alternate childcare. Parents pick community, spread kids, spread other. kids take home parents take back community. 

Sending kids back school going absolute shit storm. always think like this: someone's gonna farting face, get choose whether person naked clothed. That's wear mask. Also answer question rate calculated. Go away rational thinking! fear mongering allowed here! Suicides homicides tip iceberg, sweet summer child. I'm sorting New Zealand getting lucky. Government locked entire country almost 2 months closed borders non-citizens non-residents. 

The virus gone. Everything open. Anyone arriving must spend 14 days managed quarantine security. 

By comparison, US train wreck. leadership. Entire states cheating failing what's needed......and ohmy God... Fox News allowed lie day every day. Literally killing people lying. 

Wow. state right, take shoes cause dead. state left, may able dine Chuck E Cheese near future. world still big enough US ground war China EU one US remotely feasible. claim murders/suicides/poverty related deaths top 660,000 directly attributed lockdown? 16k homicides last year, 40k suicides, saying increase roughly 100-200% months?? lockdown cause cancer death matter months?? Based what? quick ask sourcing arguing claims defy reason.

And really need check CDC curve (and get demographic info there) best mild plateau sharp increase yet stopped. empirical evidence suggests may worse. happy populace many post-lockdown issues afflicting locked countries. get head start killing vulnerable, reduce effectiveness virus harder time reaching vulnerable people. important links already removed.

It's ultimate social distancing.

USA really figured beat thing, Haha. cannot fathom seeing kid dangerously low sats, allowing put whatever breathing support hospital suggesting *three days*!

I'm really struggling understand responses we're seeing crisis - almost see business owners would desperate re-open face risk, actions risk putting kid serious danger?! that? Please send app recommendations! WHO's job warn world coordinate research provide guidance. national governments world must respond ground. huge gap two worlds lot national governments sufficiently prepared. assume know better WHO, position opinion matters. either. Nobody cares say. world cares says. sure they're correct releasing new guidance. say! resting laurels here. New Zealand scientists determined June 15th elimination day, 99% chance eliminating virus. last community transmission case back April. beat toughest lockdown world, taken 2 cases community transmission. earliness lockdown much harshness let us stamp virus completely. 

We still regular community sentinel testing assure virus present community anywhere. virus present would know now. winter began May here, climate thing we'd cases now. tell what, since clearly going heed advise experts...... America, continue doing, fucking up, getting sick, dying rest us take notes make sure repeat mistakes.

Well...someone test subjects virus :-) Well there’s something good going right calendar app! Exponential af realistic side pretty useless knew CORONA months anyone else say shit china told believe every Karen US conveniently anxiety issues related masks well? shut several bigger ones riots. Yup, said long claims recently confirmed. People indeed dying alone world, Sweden apparently systemic issue think fact happened countries makes ok anywhere. government seem think address state nursing/care homes strategy, evaluate would able cope (or not), acted big surprise, speaks lack preparedness caution strategy. turn zombies? it’s consolation, thing happening every country. Predictions suggests worse. top massive death count. Correct im wrong recent Spanish study show really low Immunity rate recovered COVID patients? saying vaccine might effective really mean anything good? I'm amazed amount people UK believe second wave come, even did, would never get close previous spike.

There's lot misplaced confidence right now.

This also apply country currently celebrating low virus numbers.

It's still there, eventually we'll let guards down. masks smoking? /s right, lots doctors died. tragic. yeah probably covered things 6 days, also shame probably big deal whole scale things.

Not sure current outbreak Beijing though. articles linked mentioned shortcomings hospital treatment well. think finger-pointing region, government, private industry responsible helps old people. type constant shifting responsibility different parties ""well me! Third-Party-X responsible!"" largely contributed mess. dead people get treatment care blame lies paper - system whole failed them. know difference. obligated explain justify random person internet already labeled want be? No.

Look entire comment history really important you. find posts supporting Andrew Yang, Bernie Sanders, Black Lives Matter. Predictions suggests worse. top massive death count. get idea real evidence? reviews average 500, 1000, papers every day conducts weekly systematic review. asymptomatic spread evidence came contact tracing reporting. droplets papers reviewed. 

What's likely. making shit without evidence know actually doing? easy say whatever want. Nobody except redditors reading ideas consequences wrong. Everyone world looking say massively important. arrogance anywhere surely assume insight workings WHO. Despite people feel them, seems threw caution wind recent protests condoned even encouraged.

To think nearly three months ago anti-lockdown protests going condemned, yet outbreaks connected them. yeah dude shorted something think one big lessons pandemic care system elder/sick reformed way, applies Sweden. Lol, already live normal life without vaccine. politician buy this. best friends wedding I'm best man two weeks travel car Georgia Ohio. think bad idea risk it? agree comments, give reason. US seems like bad place raise children, without safety net special needs kid might trouble.
Anyway, wish best luck!! sewage sample Spain seems, imho, highly likely case sample corrupted.  would think one shutdown r0 below, say 0.02 would better several lockdowns years come. Economy work uncertainty imminent threats shutdowns. Swedish thing found European home country foreseeable future IKEA meatballs.... USA Sweden, well, pandemic likely end enough people infected

What enough immunity generated infection, last long enough afterwards? herd immunity ""work"", people need predictably sufficiently immune least year infection, would guess. IFR 0.5%, millions die process. Unless get effective vaccine. didn't. consider issue resource allocation public compliance. there's little concern using PPE dealing HAZMAT situation. I'm sure got plenty colleagues acute situation happens, pre-pandemic least. world resources. even developed countries enough PPE go around. PPE, everything else comes public health advice. can't assume worst every new virus, even one terrible this. must strike balance using precautionary principle ability world meet potential threat. 

The second issue compliance. Look hard get people wear masks. part reason took long release guidance advising everyone wear mask. tell people wash hands people generally abide. ask stay 6 feet away people others throw parties otherwise it. Ask wear masks even start saying fuck it. people say fuck tend say fuck everything, one new thing. again, we're back balancing underestimating risk non-compliance come overestimating. 

Think way. Assuming EMT medical professional, use negative pressure suit every time encounter someone work? would surely prevent getting potential disease have. also, waste resources? expensive would colleagues, including outside medical facility? long colleagues say fuck start wearing mask rather full suit? obviously exaggeration principles essentially same. Wear masks leave home get back, when? 

Whose opinion would trust tell take long would wait gave up?  edited update that. case, Sydney significantly larger Melbourne, least way NYC twice large it’s 2nd largest city. 

Just saying, virus done weird things. think could resting laurels there... Cant believe even took it. POS I'm Victoria test asymptomatic people now. testing site went last week actually without symptoms.  Maybe different state? keep hearing completely different stories.

1) got church
2) got party
3) parents doctor nurse used medical knowledge treat instead taking hospital could get worse.
4) parents religious nuts anti-vaxxers believe medicine killed rather treated doctors.
5) treated hydroxychloroquine immune issues.
6) treated hydroxychloroquine parents believe everything Trump says.
7) treated medicine parents work medical field.
8) parents murdered her.

My question true? consistent thing I've read anywhere online died immune-compromised. matter, hundreds thousands people dead worried country going bankrupt. Talk first world problems... I’ve always discouraged vote due electoral college system well. It’s really piece shit.  Mask ordinances coming. Norman OK passed one hope cities follow. general, yes. reply point current death rate trending downwards reflective US's early lockdown efforts, saw steady decrease infections. we're seeing uptrend infections, I'd expect death rates follow week's time.

That said, honestly hope happen. We'll see. Give facts baby, now, ignorant giving credit people subject dont understand, even know 1% about. So, go suck 1k$ Gilead vaccine ? works side see.. issue Sweden split nursing homes run private companies municipalities, doctors hospitals regions. way know nursing home contacted doctor specific doctor residents unless nursing home contacts hospitals request resident admitted (not ICU, general hospitalization) - hospitals can't really react it. states might really doubt US whole will.    
It would take leadership president drive that.    
      
States currently competing resources testing. record, nothing answer question. No, Melbourne largest city Australia. Ever heard Sydney? 

Also unlike US Australia totally sealed one state borders back early March. impossible cross state lines without entering 14-days govt controlled quarantine state-run facilities. border left open Victoria New South Wales finally sealed yesterday. 

The Melbourne cases analysed tell originated leakage quarantine hotels earlier June. Australia basically eliminated virus, second wave came failures specific hotels closed state borders spread beyond one state. 

Also Australia consistently high testing rates positive rates less one-tenth one percent. early days NYC across US testing awfully low that's early transmission missed. Let guess. guidance issued people working, continue work, home? Keeps posting stupid shit knows comment 🤣 I'm looking Borris eating orange small brain all. Oh agree sure. meant like “I get people coming say that, healthcare come known increased risk given they’re dealing patients communicative diseases, even think that, there’s arguing teachers signed that.” Idk makes sense. Like disagree anyone saying nurses signed die patients, even accept fact knew increased risk thing going based nature job, teachers *certainly* didn’t sign that, argument wouldn’t apply. real question friends Ex facebook? Lmao finest McNuggets 100% opinion matter nothing thread. Touché impression negatives highly increased well.  not? Hard tell. Research very, costly.

As (former) researcher, I'd much liked $1.6bn land lap fund research :) Sweden's economy gained slightly neighbors' contracted. may well contract quarter, contract like others? remains seen, empirical evidence suggests otherwise. also introvert. expected would overjoyed alone time socially accepted reason isolate, learned situation happened completely killed ounce joy enjoyment anything life. 

Ie. finally wanted - time - absolutely incapable enjoying depression deepens every day. happened circumstances... Wait Easter, believe me! greater 1 fucked, higher 1 fucked are, even 1.0000001, given enough time engulf entire country.

Prevention measures reduce R0 different degrees, reducing 1 things get better. lower number quicker outbreak die down, even 0.9999999, given enough time cause virus completely die out. three weeks ago cases rising dozen states, two weeks ago cases twenty-two states. mayor's ""placebo las vegas"" Yes, articles meant mostly April/May Sweden peak time. 
  
This accounted devastatingly high death toll months 115 deaths per day. since peak numbers hospitalisation/ICU/deaths pointing down. 

I find weird pointed again. People dying alone World, article mostly failure care company, actually investigation breaking workplace safety laws bl.a. 
But yes, Sweden (and many countries) reform nursing homes/care system. Nothing works. different let young people get get it. proposing half staff move where?? Rooms somewhere?? away families, month time. feeds children? pay rent apartments? Here’s something posted today Vegas... sort exemplifies everything mentioned: (I evidence that? Dumb. Reminds surgeon general’s tweet stop buying masks. saying phrase ""without proper PPE"" kinda counter intuitive lol proper proper protection equipment incline looks pretty steep. hope goes too!

I'm SD county. better numbers, still rising. Stay safe! definitely common sense general public. one gets sick thinks longterm effects. What's hammered home symptoms virus/bacteria happens gone. Especially asymptomatic mild symptoms. Arizona big protests. caused protests would massive spikes places like Minnesota, Baltimore, DC NYC centered. Answer Chinese.

Miraculously, none countries done good job preventing epidemics blamed China national level

If country wants prevent epidemic, way strengthen precautions take seriously

The released PHEIC January 31, mainstream western countries prepared this? No, Korea it.

You're well school trying hard enough, students tell studying hard enough

Besides, told watch out.he told watch out. I’m Canadian 100% think border stay closed. next 12 months. revisit subject. Australia. Dentists taking extraordinary measures safe treating extreme pain. rally two months: “I’ve built two walls, one keep Canadia one Mexico”. they’re paying it, see it. lot people told It’s really best walls we’ve ever built. good walls, best really. good couldn’t believe it.”

Fuck guy already. Like 5% spain? isn’t science works. 

Also let’s entertain hypothetical. enough needles syringes produced take care fraction need most. 

A real vaccine takes minimum year due needing understand long term effects. Potato? Thank you, I'll keep mind. Aunt died this. died pulmonary embolism. one who'd check grandma most. think part waited started fainting want bring anything back her. Instead, grandma found daughter dead. American think keep borders closed, virus direct comparison India China similar population (1.38B vs 1.42B) similar density (excluding uninhabited Western Chinese desert). Chinese cooperated lockdown, used time prepare. America not. matter weeks, we'll see whether India prepared like China, failed like America.

I've waiting since February. Nothing significance. Move on. they?

WW2 veterans utmost respect. 
Since then, USA threat, military turned well-paid job opportunity, high risk. Every conflict USA engaged modern times large part initiated them. Warfare becone business model weapon industry, absolute disgrace. 19% actually want open Welcome world outside bubble. quick quiz, could help fighting pandemic?: 
a) work 
b) work sense lot depression behind words. How’s antidepressant threating ya? debts? mind... hm.. anyhow, piss dead mothers grave worthless queer. Impressive explanation simple brained, I’m gonna borrow that. Many cities reporting **contact tracer** data outbreaks occurring spreading. look it, heavily indoor establishments like bars, nursing homes, congregations people like church folks packed together air conditioning. literally data see argue that. completely throwing opinion without facts back spewing misinformation.  places opened indoor dining stopped getting take from. honestly get people urge eat indoors. brother wife kid little month ago hospitals still pretty locked many cases.

The staff administration major hospitals enough time experience figure pretty sensible approaches seem working. They’ve working making sure mothers safely give birth since pandemic began.

There additional rules procedures — fathers effectively quarantined room mother, neither could leave room ready discharged, tested beforehand, staff full PPE whenever entered room, family couldn’t visit, etc.

Overall, though, worked safely without issues.

The bigger thing sounds like probably trying make sure everyone household tries minimize day-to-day risks infection don’t end either parent self-quarantine weeks given much work newborn be!

Best luck! That's true. people can't masking social distancing US case numbers going roof. think you’re forced reopen early. Regarding Germany's death rate, Germany one countries really unaccounted excess deaths means number deaths due Covid-19 one accurate worldwide. forget people world visiting plenty drunk high something / multiple things. economic collapse usa would bring pain,crime,death,suffering , starvation hard imagine. 

That danger. Consumer spending big part keeps us economy chugging along, related coronavirus? probably looked crazy shit going America said *n p e* Yea fairly accurate degree, turns pandemic response something like boring. Thank you, Fitbit users actually make majority 5k+ participants moment it’s great idea get word out. (Supplementary fig 1 paper details devices whole cohort). I'm American agrees. But, would mind making exception migrate promise quarantine 2 weeks wear mask? need get tf place. stupid everywhere, spreading. Well fair Sweden *some* things, like closing schools. far little doubled little.

By seem control (R 0.7 seems, paid needlessly high toll it. Personal responsibility finest! churches sued civil damage? Also 7-2 suit red reverse uno card. Americans come Canada! want here! use loophole come vacation get hockey stick side head fucking hoser. Stay shithole country. Yes, high suspicion, buy in. China also said something march. feel masks useful. govts able comply stricter rules aerosol transmissions, aerosol transmission get official badge. bet apply short immunity span. Ya, sorry America, fine lol It’s infected nearly one every hundred AMERICANS, Floridians Hah. Yeah month ago....epidemiologists agree case totals reflective happening 2 weeks ago. Plenty time protests riots shown .... Idiot. Canada live?

I'm actually curious it, wondering actually lie well enough convince anyone. death rate. calculated different ways. also make everything, curds included, home. lot work, makes poutine better. Also, trick (according Quebecois coworker) add bit hot sauce gravy. Yup Theres always big gap recovered, deaths total number cases. doesn’t get discussed much reason. Maybe I’ve misunderstanding data presented I’ve always assumed it’s due long takes recover guys vandalizing people's cars, harassing them, apparently also assaulting plates places. Despite knowing many citizens vehicles bring U.S. think I'll pass. actually take seriously took long find virus actually named SARS-CoV-2 ""novel coronavirus"" keeps referred media day. even know related SARS.

Turns confusion downplaying intentional beginning.

From risk communications perspective, using name SARS unintended consequences terms creating unnecessary fear populations

Good job, scare people enough give shit confused. playing politics this. mean, one saw coming, right? Right...? train wreck whole thing is. lol Nope, actually no. wear mask, avoid going anywhere absolutely necessary; generally avoid people like plague. consider day win don’t interact single stranger. fact, I’m known go tell people fuck try approach cause. They're already shut Israel. live somewhere else, please state where. Same, sadly. United States deaths cases. Full stop. worst counting world. Before, thought carried water drops, which, yanno, drop. Gravity thing, gets outta range people's nose/mouth seconds. 

Now, well...to scientific ...it's skunk spray. Smoke. Fish microwave. closet Aunt Bessie stored moth balls. Two pound open jar garlic. Busted perfume behind dresser. cause gone, molecules scent case, virus, linger everywhere. Shit wait 2 weeks find appointment get tested. get tested Friday. wear Fitbit myself. need Fitbit user join trails, consider heading r/Fitbit recruiting there... Get vote, every level government. Encourage family friends same. Hope stay healthy, please wear mask. Ding ding ding.

Don't say low. took advantage Katrina New Orleans. Nearly two decades later *still* public schools. Wow, Vin Diesel uncredited role it. I’m sure what’s weirder: disease, made movie it, Vin Diesel. mean, old could 1990? Like knew back started? shit... ""just wash hands bro, way catch it"" Oh. Got it. You’re right 2020: year taking GF dinner become illegal

&amp;#x200B;

And thought dystopian societies scifi... Typical response someone denies facts listens Fox News.  article.. Surprising...

In Tuesday interview KFDM, Abbott criticized local leaders wanted place state another lockdown obtain autonomy making coronavirus mitigation decisions.

""I found one thing consistent,"" Abbott said. ""All local officials asking shut Texas back down, they're absolutely refused enforce current executive orders already place."" Abbott added local leadership needed show ""action, absenteeism."" daily infection numbers correct, India far deaths Europe combined, India suffer overrun, lower resources. 

China, Italy Spain strict lockdown (the Chinese directly advised Italy Spain), people starve kept food moving needed it. 

The direct comparison India China similar population (1.38B vs 1.42B) similar density (excluding uninhabited Western Chinese desert). Chinese cooperated lockdown, used time prepare. America not. matter weeks, we'll see whether India prepared like China, failed like America. They’ll extend trust zoonotic virus, animals act trough it. catch spread COVID, taken account well discussing herd immunity.   Thats science. huge factor. instance people apple watches take night charge don’t get clear resting heart rate sleep. data saved Apple HealthKit far less fine smartwatches. Every system it’s faults accuracy, user biases, saved measures quite challenging. better others, poses unique challenges aptly suggest. No, shone bright light massive systemic issues elderly care around capital region. Privatisation deregulation big factor virus killed many elderly. hate meeses pieces!! Well, yeah, strain one infected places via Europe Emergency approval high risk patients frontline workers might come October full use authorization early 2021, stated article. Let’s hope helps don’t expect everyone get one year’s end. Plan taking precautions rest year. Good fucking luck that. 

Can imagine class full moderately severely special education children pandemic? 0 chance they’ll keeping masks on. 0. Many need constant redirection constant physical stimulation. 

Their parents probably vocal sending kids back, good reason! would too! education worth lives teachers students building? Call ableist want, teachers staff members high risk health conditions? Certainly lives matter too? I’m sure opt early retirement rather put risk, fair even ask so? It’s one thing say nurses signed risk lives patients. disagree, they’re least aware risk contracting diseases work general. Teachers didn’t sign give lives (by dying) teach students. There’s certain amount risk contracting disease job around people, that’s teachers signed for. 

Meanwhile, students whose parents work in-person jobs likely class. means transmission go community workers, workers children, child child child school staff, children school staff back homes, infect vulnerable people ALSO workers go community continue cycle transmission.

Then you’re going rooms full special ed kids absolutely going increasing risk everyone else. It’s going shit show.

There’s better way put “if you’re video meetings opening schools up, shouldn’t be.” conversations need having. transmission

Hasn't known (or least strongly suspected) since, like, April? aren’t yet idiot.... Florida southern states opened blm protests (also don’t forget ANTILOCKDOWN protests happened prior) seeing effects thoseee FIRSTTT data clearlyyy nationwide riots unrest result x100 worseeee seeing now. can’t believe stupid think protests effect bars restaurants lmao Sure, happen, people often die days diagnosis, diagnosed positive death. avg 17 days. go much, seen one person pulled last months. officer indeed wearing mask. WWX Pro Slim, coming soon oil reserves run out. remember US government putting snipers rooftops discourage looting New Orleans hospitals deciding got helicopter left die? Pepperidge farm remembers. Tell medical staff... savez lifes Behold t-cell 👍 Oh 'mighty' fallen. Excellent point. appreciate always like open discussions. no, website isn’t mine. saw posted investing discussion daily update. know sources listed fact credible. don’t understand people’s approach isn’t website heard it’s simply less credible? Shouldn’t ABC, NBC, Funny Fox mass media less credible newsletter corporate political motive (blurred motivation)? simply want accurate information portrayed sub reddit superior twitter. least Trump talks twitter fake news media platform. See edit. live US. people complaining politics. One person family right leaning concerned Covid always wears face shield public. see many immigrants north korea eh Seeing went Europe, really 2 months rather 2 weeks. Unless lock *completely*. country world went far, essential services need continue operating, slows R2 dampening Especially Australia never serious difficulties availability tests either. would somewhat surprised counting even double, let alone margin they're suggesting here.

There's also slightest mention fact east coast blanketed smoke extended period bush fires. Talking deaths respiratory illnesses without mentioning pretty ridiculous.  Well, somehow Brexit happened, guess share idiots way larger 16%. even China yes, dumb. CDC recons real number 10 20 times amount. Lol Completely wrong animated depictions actual transmission scenarios. Pass along colleagues morons looks like Francis Underwood good president. Well already know Americans care children. Look readily create excuses Sandy Hook. people numb Sandy Hook, knew real problem. seriously willing risk kids economy essentially boils to.  Comply help save lives. god. I’ve never seen crowded beach. Surely photoshopped r/confusingperspective. would crowd much even pre-COVID? know wha people want . 


Short told GET covid-19 KILL guaranteed horrific fashion take cautious? 


The data suggest "" careful take precaution "" find fault simple idea "" wary healthy"" ""protect ""? insanity suggest day tell us nothing else careful right now. Hell no. parent would? Read Covid19 sub Yes. ""God"" going shit. scientists working vaccine going save us. deserve praise, collective delusion sizable portion population. scary part claim Dr. Fauci telling corona patients life span 15 years shorter. wonder full context is. Funny rich gotten even richer pandemic. Wall street breaking records almost everyday real world try survive goes hell. Interesting way run country right ground full speed. Wonder long bill comes due long depression last pay it? Glad sitting piece info. news, sun hot. case it’s still caused virus nightmarish sequelae people, people worried course Fauci does, predicted bazillion deaths extremely wrong It’s since January, already herd immunity  Deaths going reported US on. doubt we'll top \~1.2k ever again. Maybe even 1k. Yes, especially let scientists handle it. We’re brainwashed associate care insurance, think insurers source care. PA pretty reasonable. 

I would think eastern PA cases really dropped steady low level open

Not sure western PA it’s rising Yes 100%, also us Georgia business going anywhere. control unless you’re locked house weeks could infected. Yeah, I'm also asthmatic used travel public transport. Since begining March entered bus kind public transport since switched telework left house food always mask.

I also know people respiratory/pulmonary conditions left house since March.

We know careful scared, normal less us hospitals.

If indeed treatment great, first need see amount people problems among confirmed sick. also low might case prevention treatment. southern drawl let’s honest. US funded influence africa, primary beneficiary WHO's medical aid.

at least that's see deeper level. I’m glad hear NZ well thought Melbourne, Australia? anyone insights Germless Masks? parents buying hype want start buying even though hooked reputable KN95 seller that’s FDA approved (so know actually legit).  really don’t want switching less safe mask they’re buying company’s spiel. Better US **Simpson's paradox**, goes several names, phenomenon trend appears several different groups data disappears reverses groups combined. 

&amp;#x200B;

Nothing that. Hard say. November/December still months away. current trends I'd say border might still closed. extended doubt, billionaires wall street. let us useless eaters fend ourselves, count that. Sure would good time forward looking pols start talking seriously UBI raising national minimum wage but...naw must protect need protection first always! Weed’s legal CA couple years now. Tax revenue helps cover schools Thank you. word salad non-professionals literally driving INSANE. Many Americans also say things ""fine"". Wow even US wouldn’t right Haha device used every day, 24 hours per day, 24 months think ppl going charge Wrong thread? something can't wrap head around comes people. know someone like this, one thing, constantly genuinely believe optimistically stupid things. like think best version events always going play they're constantly dumbfounded angry doesn't. also depends long immunity last. Anti bodies stay long. that's indication immunity. Cool. Even though.. Like wtf become?? must sheep.

or roo.

choose one. People often get puzzled someone speaks common narrative chuck downvote. think bring good arguments discussion. good look different sides things. bag too, read attack well gets better better ... Umm yeah, no, lived childhood teen lives social media never suffered mental health crisis CoVID, climate catastrophes, shitstorm economic issues caused previous generations came along. Way deflect real problems. high speed rails. Gas auto tire industry gotta make $$$ ..... alright.

According WHO. *hangs ten covid toes* Cowabunga dude.  dad told classic story king inventor chess asking get paid grain. 64 squares doubling enough cover earth. call couple months nothing empirical evidence.

Sweden stricter measures neighboring countries now, hospital care non-covid diseases queuing up, can't travel anywhere, on.
Why making swedes happy? moment getting infected day. We're 66% 200k. Oh, I’m sorry, misread comment one “you’re sacrificing lives sake saving economy” types arguments seems pretty popular around here. 

I totally agree you. Agreed. argued ass watch news repeats talking points see lot people parrot. whole family thd way. baby staying away recommended 2 weeks it'd awesome shut week stressed worried. think I'm overreacting since start thing. doesnt prove anything, lot international media outlets predicting fall Sweden right now. Considering bad Sweden fucked April, trend looking better many expected. ICU beds fill death rate increases dramatically that. :-( don’t ‘believe’ masks. concern public health - preventative protective. You’re showing true colors - writing whole country urban legend. don’t understand articles like this. 

They already presuming it’ll work they’ve ordered doses. 

And point turn around say “unfortunately vaccine isn’t safe won’t manufactured”? far seems successful wouldn’t work? It’s known produce anti-bodies COVID-19. also explain something evidence causes encephalitis? I'm absolutely medical professional could far base- affecting blood vessels brain would lend credence idea also causing symptoms mental disturbance etc? nah already secret subterfuge organization. called NED. That's recent development though. I'm aware state Victoria started recently. bad think anyone thus far knows shit new virus never seen before. Cast members could also bring guests. eat right now?? support restaurants getting takeout. I'm sure none waitstaff want interact infection-spraying open mouths absolutely need to. Long weekend backlog? also 0 food Yea school started today would send children? Good luck, hope things work guys. saying pubs/bars/indoor dining great public health perspective (as evidenced article). simulations show airborne sone simulations show droplet based. famous simulation bbc news see people coughing super market example, prove droplet based. 

Now think likely remain static air without gravity pulling (aka airborne). Gimmee millions shame want Universal that, medical reason wear face shield get special bracelet. Also rides let face shield. it’s horrible disease one likes talk it? heard podcast kind wish I’d skipped episode lol Historically vaccine development slow side(years months). even expedited Contained eliminated Ebola, twice, war zones. prove? Didn’t Denmark lock much aggressively? point sweden ok financially what? honestly tired media constantly trying put spin everything without due diligence “analytics”.. love technical answers kinda fucked true nonetheless

UPVOTE virus hyped nothing. latest reports show death rate far less seaonal flu. 

why china lock down? kill dissidents. that's why. 30% discount 3 months, that's country recommended (with subsidy).

but even without subsidy consensus seems less align decision (30~50% discount first/two months) “We didn’t know bad last two weeks horrendous backlog ability test” way make better news. mean rest world? Yeah registered one Rite Aid. Maybe prioritize appointments people symptoms risky setting, I’m asymptomatic high risk work, couldn’t schedule one 3 days out. Oh appointments booked yesterday afternoon. can't really contact trace China earliest cases, strange evidence signs virus October November. believe whichever area shows first outbreak likely ground zero. virus, even low lethality, go unnoticed spreads.  said, science community needs hard proof claim anything, evidence least suggest alternative theories that's worthwhile look want find source virus. disagree. promoting ""transparency"" China without telling anyone international inspection teams turned away. forefront advising healthy people wear masks guidance still downplays use masks. web page supposed give public needs know CV-19 still promoting ""heavy droplet"" theory months science pretty clear aerosolization quite real. says three feet enough social distancing scientists beginning express concern six feet enough. 

Let's remember similarly dropped ball Ebola. 

They bystanders, good ones. leaders. Again, let us confuse potential organization like reality. Yep. According article, covid-10 Texas. Wait till gets covid-19. implications hotels, workplaces, cruise ships phenomenal confirmed. absolutely correct explains portion increase cases. it. Look hospitalizations increasing states. CV hospitalizations general ICU beds getting filled, mostly CV patients. notice immediately, disgusting. Nevermind, see that's areas negatives increasing rate.   I'm surprised im even alive point, much exposure thrust every day work throughout past 4 months. small percentage customers wear mask correctly (most wear around chins) one following social distancing staying home. Since beginning March grocery store wall wall people open close every day, lines like never before. likely already infected know it, numbers true. sort is. trend increasing weekend 3 low days, compared normal 2, artificially trended (due lower reporting). deaths added back cause 7 day average trend increase artificial.

If look actual figures, 3rd July 7 day average 555, yesterday 556. barely noticeable increase doesn’t yet represent change. think increase likely due additional cases, moment it’s soon tell NZ eliminated it. Citizens returning county Covid held isolation 2 weeks. someone escape yesterday. pretty big news here. go back 1500 deaths per day stay August, schools won’t open corporate America keep working home (to latter point, offices won’t fully open virus close eradicated, there’s need to). fact never really got summer lull would imply virus isn’t seasonal. We’re guaranteed apocalyptic fall, may look like same. What? Memorial Day also end May, several states spiking opened even earlier that. Hmmmmm

Someone know also EXACT wish knew emotional context behind quote.

I always naively imagined WW2 leaders rising challenge always making right call. human nature change I'm sure screwed some, too. depends curve growth. simulation example, provide parameters fit COVID-19 transmission prevention strategy plot curve you. someone done inverse taken IRL curve calculated reverse find actual R0 corresponds curve.

You note R0 lower estimated 2-6 ""no countermeasure"" value, that's states least something people modified behaviour virus spread easily. unless enough done get R0 blow 1 case count continue grow.

Or conversely, case count increasing that's dead give away R0 1. Yeah live hurricane zone tornadoes occasionally strike live. reinforced concrete storm shelter came property bought, I'm really glad there. use yet though (tornadoes pretty rare although climate change messing tornadoes forming US.) Lol fucking moronic college kids want get “the Vid” new fashion statement aren’t worried brain dead 40 potentially unknown consequences system-wide virus.

The human body naturally designed forego viruses, obviously. don’t put ICU bed cause bleed every oriface body mean it’s nonchalant get it.. 

Adaptation time helped, think virus courses entire body (assumedly) dissipates leaves residual issues aftermath clinical idiocy.

Everyday articles coming forth. Damage asymptomatic patients’ lungs, brain damage, heart issues, blood clots, etc. 

If something like Ebola, US would apocalyptic war zone now. count blessings underestimate severity virus, regardless guesstimated mortality. paywall Maybe shuffle around HCWs already experience NYC.

Don’t forget, Italy [had people before, US 5x population Italy... Paradoxical potential turn tragic. here. guarantee thing Stockholm least. remember used Magical, please give news story South Korea's health minister saying China lied.
I've searched English Chinese media, can't find source.
If South Korea's health minister said this, would caused huge uproar Chinese English media, fact China South Korea working together coronavirus.

In mid-March, Yuanda Group entered cooperation Seoul National University Hospital exported South Korea, two buildings add cardiopulmonary negative pressure wards negative pressure isolation hospital capacity 500 beds, completed 13 days.

If South Korean Health Minister said this, clear politicization medical issue.
We know politicizing coronavirus.

On March 13, China-Korea Joint Prevention Control Cooperation Mechanism Responding New Coronavirus Epidemic officially established held first video conference. mechanism led diplomatic departments two countries, participation health, education, customs, immigration civil aviation departments.
On April 29, China South Korea held second video conference Joint Prevention Control Mechanism, announcing establishment ""fast track"" movement personnel urgently needed important business, logistics, production technical services China South Korea; relevant personnel apply visas fulfilling necessary administrative examination approval procedures country, enter country carry normal activities accordance principle closed-loop management passing health tests quarantine inspections.

I love polite it, common sense ban Americans point? pandemic badly handled, many Americans gleefully dismissing virus even taking seriously could easily infected aren't. Americans currently safe around.

Those us idiots understand support ban, lives come first. Neither herd immunity economy factor swedish strategy. press seem really bad job. Mexico def say kids go Mexico party night head back across border trashing streets. 🙄

It could single oddity deaths keep going down, could deaths begin level, could deaths begin increase. brainwashed?  Sweden shown one truly free societies world pandemic. police military curtailing personal liberty, unlike almost every country Europe.

That's called 1%. so? economy one world grew instead shrinking last quarter

Of course. Sweden country postponed Covid action last quarter over. current quarter, drop similar countries. Spanish Flu current China situation know countries lock early hard cope better economically lockdown painful, shorter, consumer confidence regained quickly afterwards. interesting talk Week Virology podcast days ago opening schools.

Its panel experts, MDs, immunologists, etc agreed schools open. basic argument risk, least addition current risk levels, increased much school openings. many kids bad home situations go unknown without schools, social/emotional risks huge longer kids can't socialize. Numbers NYC showed person tested positive Coronavirus, 10 people recovered virus (based antibody testing). US 3,000,000 tested cases, number actual people estimated 30,000,000.

The 10 1 ratio changes time based lot factors. Stay out, eh! CCP still sucks tho Five people dog? Anything possible, dog fit profile. know much it'll cut spread almost third people longer candidates spread infections? I'm sorry India trying all. 28 Days/Weeks Later?

They've completely compromised image. studies done, lot ""we believe possible"" they've got t's crossed i's dotted, time big announcement. autistic friend, confirm every stereotype ""literal Swedes"" unable roll it.


If 20, 40 50% irrelevant, we're getting sustainable fashion, figuring half battle. 

Come October hell breaks lose smug countries, people begin congregate indoors again, lockdown temporary safety economic pain realize they'll endure? Probably nonetheless proven right. 

Letting slowly burn October see small manageable outbreak crucial. 
In meantime tend fire, let simmer. 

It's marathon sprint, guys know better NYE, patience. Interesting question now

Who losing ground faster? 

USA China impression I’ve read aim operate around 65-75% capacity normal conditions.

That said, many hospitals found ways temporarily expand capacity route patients hospitals, sometimes ways sound like significantly hurt quality care. wouldn’t weren’t becoming strained.

The problem seems hospitals may becoming strained others still capacity.

The nature infectious disease going mean we’ll tend see even cases faster areas already cases. So, hospitals areas surge cases get swamped others might half empty preparation scenario.

So overall capacity across entire isn’t always good measure.

Ie, could hold blowtorch hand point I’ve increased average body temperature hardly all. average ICU capacity whole state still 100% doesn’t mean hospitals aren’t struggling, evident data based first-hand reports. air still allowed (in direction).

what's rationale that? Pretty certain refugees fleeing civil wars think pretty tame. 
    
If look stats, “deaths /1M pop”,   
Colorado currently 295/1M pop.   
California currently 166/1M pop.   
    
I don’t know important stat though. Chinese Gestapo. Ok George Costanza pretty much 30 days since cases started going again, previous trends believed deaths roughly one month lag new cases. would expect deaths start going imminently, unless since mutated less deadly form. many results found. 

Please refine search parameters search again. isn't. took Sweden quite time ban it.

Lockdowns contributed increased poverty (which amplifies death counts many sources), increased deaths suicides, increased deaths diseases (cancer example), increased homicides, decreased standards living, more.

Lockdowns moved death statistics bit away Covid onto things. may well cause deaths Covid long run, certainly ruin lives many others. Fair enough. whole, seems slowly decreasing time being.

I get I’m hitting head epidemiology, hard, I’m sorry. take fun allegory, happens true:

In 1917-1918, US military mobilizing war, bringing together vast pools young men resulted several severe measles outbreaks, killing cases 10% infected.

Even protections like ‘pox parties,’ outbreaks swept major US cities cyclically every 2-3 years (many 250k critical mass, leading cyclical outbreaks). certainly outbreaks measles vaccine.

I'm glad French competent caring. answer is, many cases: every country jails trials prisons. many would accept situation poverty dictates long likely spend time jail.

How it’s solved varies. Pick country, look solution, copy one seems work. mean, seems like news outlets switched covering covid-19 protests. people's attention span pretty short, house could fire news tells there's fight Kardashians, focus attention that.

The timing protests really worse. Media switches attention protests people protests news coverage. Meanwhile covid-19 coverage pushed way background, causes people think longer issue.

However many say stuff like ""Only old people die it."" ignore impact takes ""recovered"" well effects yet know of. ok, really messed up. combine Trump voter... US spiraling down, definitely. Oh, jury still measuring reinfection possible. know level antibodies need considered 'immune', antibodies would even protect virus infecting many people could mutate new strain rather quickly. 

Potential scenario might see future this: Since person who's already infected earlier might (new research coming out) still come positive test (due Sars-Cov-2 RNA still bring detected body), common reliable method testing someone covid-19 (serology aka blood test) might reliable.q People might say ""oh I've already it, tests told positive since weeeks ago"", im reality reinfected.

For groups, Monday teacher planning day.

I done math school district needs children go online group. Classrooms, buses, etc capacity pandemic. New social distancing guidelines greatly reduce capacity. enough space everyone.

The school district going need hire lot teachers. Many teachers online hires. need local.

If teacher Republican controlled district superintendent says ""Get ass classroom. care many unmasked students coughing you."" probably get new online teaching job teaching kids.

But, looking number deaths percent increase decrease previous day's deaths, yesterday's jump anomalous. day entire pandemic bigger percent increase deaths March 2nd, 8 deaths compared 2 March 1st. Yes, post-memorial-day increase 745 slightly yesterday's increase 658. percent increase, day memorial day, deaths increased 217%. Yesterday's increase 370%. 

Here daily percent change number deaths looked like course epidemic, clearly showing weekly dips spikes: Yesterday stands out.

Despite logical reason believe could happen, really beginning hope deaths actually going stay flat even number cases rose. breaks heart yesterday's numbers suggest fortunate. Good you, fuck Churches nowadays forget even Israelites practiced quarantine. Based many comments I've read, yeah, think they're pretty safe saying racist. Today second day Malaysia local infections since June 29. Today also remarks amazing day last patient Sri Petaling Cluster discharged, thus ending cluster thought thing asylum too... except there’s compelling reason. It’s like gangs hunting mask-wearers down... yet... 🤦🏻‍♂️😂 hope get covid,oh wait did. damage done full economic shutdown become severe disease itself. agree one comments though, masks required federal, state local level. Even Fauci says shutting economy blunt tool last resort. used teach years ago, 1 nurse 10 elementary schools. nurse would one day every two weeks. office staff take temperatures, give medication, etc. 9 days. can’t even imagine happen now.

Biased sampling yield reasonable estimate population parameter. need random sampling! SF represent. Feels good man. SF dense fuck city managed keep shit control. Hella proud rn. many people know generally staying indoors like.... since early march..... Singapore, particular, reported 1,000 weekly infections past month. National Environment Agency (NEA) says 15,000 dengue cases recorded Singapore alone year. Furthermore, 16 deaths also documented.

Nobody reporting 15,000 cases Dengue Singapore they're reporting single case Dengue China? Dengue fever common every tropical country tons people get it. Almost 100%. It’s fractional part drive media’s response. Dead COVID kid bueno. Tom Britton, works closely FHM also said Stockholm would get herd immunity May: I’ve tested twice past three weeks co-workers contracted virus. 

It’s hard put words pissed lies make me. Legalize article read clearly distinguished antibodies present body's ability manufacture quickly.

They're two different things. body's antibody numbers may drop quickly. mean body ""remember"" disease quickly recognize invader shows make fresh batch antibodies.

The latter actually makes sense. waste resources continually make antibodies make need them? oh shit gets re-elected image virus huge remission next year Easter he'll totally say that! 133k dead, biggie right? Pennsylvania already were.

Religious people retarded, mention churches basically stole millions tax dollars tithes donations real estate wasn’t enough.

wanna guess number...


it went again...  make several studies note relationship? Alabama also mask requirement governor clear issue one. bigger cities ordinances majority not. 91 residents receive in-depth supervision noted shortcomings

Poor residents. think Covid environmentalism need change systemic individual levels. Covid, government drop ball people stepped voluntarily distance mask, like happened Japan, would fine, since people cannot governments need regulate enforce. environmentalism, people would undergo behaviour change en mass refuse purchase non-sustainable manufactured goods, chose lifestyle minimize impact etc governments corporations would choice change. know sounds radical also think lot time alternatives become worse. would make lot sense. 3.6 Roentgen, good bad either Religion strikes look history.

Love RC. thing don’t enjoy car smell like fried food day afterward. here. home school well. supposed student teach spring (was supposed past spring, dropped last second), that’s struggle comes in. Bad time career change. Depends state district there’s definitely movement area (WV) least setting schools earlier earlier last two decades. went mid-September mid-June, year would second week August later half May. Though delay school start earlier today Sept 8th instead COVID.

So got Boomers retiring known issue.

That's got tested. imagine people go dr. curiosity. know coworker tested us work. thought levelled off? work Oxford ye.  stop spreading, nowhere near serious enough shut world stop spread it.

That's really main point every country opened though far slow. Let's look Ontario, densely populated province people southwestern Ontario. numbers trending today 118 cases test positivity rate 1% catching them. US today 60,000 cases. math Ontario would 2,727 cases match US rate. number better 118 2,727? cases today 23 time higher per capita. think death rate going lower much longer think mistaken. im already benzos anxiety physically addicted them. Cant mix two..... 17k? time span of... long? Good points all. mutation front, could swear saw paper prevalence new strain mean it'll proven out, evidence exist. ""What textbooks say us 50 years?""

""If win, textbooks 50 years."" one is. Today’s cases probably go introduced corona weekend. haven’t seen weekend population caught bet won’t see till end week beginning next. I’m betting Tuesday next week going really bad. seems like app common phrases/sentences would better. click grocery store button pops common things might need stay, choose one type hit play oh makes sense now! even here! screwed. I've never seen someone power less fight something like pandemic. Joe rogan say anything. Dr Rhonda Patrick one came JRE said seems link covid vitamin deficiency prepared u fat fuck control studies mask use general public lower transmission rates covid-19 either though. Good scientific proof anything years come right now. doesn’t mean isn’t good idea try. monster came snatched anyone second broke rules keep us safe. issue one weighing priorities responses. people response issues regarding police racism? nothing intolerable. Waiting pandemic weakens message. people do, right now, express displeasure provide social pressure fix problem? many avenues, United States citizens right peaceful protest, fewer things send stronger message image people standing solidarity threat. 

The pandemic complicates things. people choosing apply social pressure online, safer impact. Ultimately, lot people find choice boiled ""Do stay home, safe, tolerate safe come out? go out, take precautions can, help support movement end racism?"" 

I judge people choose stay home. judge people choose go whatever precautions can. hard thing, choose health need member society help fix blatant injustice. 

But going outside protest enact change via social political pressure one ways allowed Constitution different going church service. understand it, people go church spiritual social health. achieved via virtual services, many churches already enacted. sufficient single day, attend multiple services, find spiritually-fulfilling actions. 

If safer method people protest reasonably strong impact, share it! People would love way stay home still enact change needed. Meanwhile I'm still forced go school TX even though student tested positive. delightful. can't make decision stop going either. want dropped Yeah, schools open it'll like bars; 2 weeks it'll close again. want kids able go back school safely, can't make happen, risk lot trying failing. outdoors savior this, it’s getting hot go foraging go run. lay floor front fan 24/7 online summer school.

Ok, I’m asshole. apologize. see feathers still ruffled 10 years later. Thanks clarification Maybe y0u get exemption anxiety. crippling. Right here

Deaths surged states. Articles like misinformation pick data point make look like deaths jumping. Look Texas. 85 deaths yesterday extended holiday weekend. daily death totals much different back May. death surge would mean would go 50's 60's 100's every day. Florida. daily death seven-day average May. change? Considering many positives getting possible. happened yet. article says has. That's one seen bump daily deaths. One reason went 300 positive cases day peaking 4,877 July 1st. Considering hit high 88 deaths day count back three weeks 600s new cases pretty obvious Arizona undercounting positives whole time. much harder get covid test Arizona states. Could Arizona see big death surge week? possible wouldnt surorise deaths come back 40-50 day hovering around mid late June.

Covid going away. put camp skeptical states going see death numbers you(and media) predicting. Lockdown!!!! can't governments get right: ""Some industries built COVID. many time dangerous public health others. government subsidizing businesses 75% prior year earnings risk subsides. funds, businesses expected retain full employment minimum 75% annualized pay prior year annualized February, ever higher.""

Boom, solved. would expensive, expensive shutting whole fucking economy again. top that, businesses could continue operate socially distanced manner (like takeout) pad 75% bit additional revenue. ZA WARUDO I'm teenager... American.

Life change much people,  9/11 great excuse implement surveillance measures start war actually event notable.

Far signicant things happen world every day.

Not someone limited mental capacity would understand that. oof. Got good. suspect actually around since August hope not. rising trend cases compare NYC/NJ back March/April? similar? would like think hospital staffs better treating patients younger contribute avoiding living hell went earlier year. One hope so. stronger stupid liquid!!!  Yeah, 'so obvious' Johns Hopkins Hospital, parent's former workplace, saying ""It's spread aerosols!"" week ago.

Get it! evidence even best health organizations recently said ""Not airborne!"" Knowing Japanese, follow rules. stated, understand jokes. Many people, including Reddit, think lizard- Bill Gates using virus chip brains. 

Clarifications them. seems like pick one study small sample size say correlation statistical significance. I'm pretty sure would easily find statistical significance pooled retrospective studies available.  can't tell exactly whether limiting conclusion one study making claim state research.

It's like workers want customers wear masks made unwitting enforcers. want customers masks ammunition favor helping them, endangering further.

these people feel entitled justified behavior blame person rage rage. disgusting.   That's necessarily true, COVID cause ""happy hypoxia"" -- basically shorting brain's ability realize oxygen deprived.

People asymptomatic mild disease sometimes show lung damage CT, unable feel symptomatically. actually pretty common.

If past thing experiencing weird reductions physical ability worry case, saying, someone mild case mean experiencing lung damage, least active infection. must, School always started last week August kid. cousins state ""Track system"" school year around full weeks month something instead. Maybe something like that? needs change. shouldn’t stores employees aren’t allowed say anything customer doesn’t mask. ""Suffered horribly"" mean every 10,000 people .. 6 died course 3 months. majority last months lives.

That's mean ""suffered horribly"", yes? Something talked court order parenting plans resulting children visiting noncustodial parent still enforced. one wants keep children parents (unless parent sucks) actively avoiding people avoid exposure nothing done risk parent may may taking things seriously enough. fact noncustodial parent would insist makes doubt seriousness putting situation. guidelines even look like went far enough fro me, thinks much? basically said open windows, wash hands, space out.

Looks like schools straight firing teachers now. still resume face defunding federal government

They’re already getting ready lay 1 million teachers according spokeswoman NPR day. Dying one way get closer God guess. suck, really damaging kids. lack proper education, mental health toll kids today must high. wish could simply lock get virus control like countries, done, even without vaccine. could try reopen schools safely. agree can't wait around vaccine, I'm even sure able make one effective flu vaccine honestly. 

It's hard cause control, government would rather force us make hard choices hurt vulnerable us instead UBI paycheck protection plan really help all. job bickering worse risk kids dying risk never getting proper education. deciding two options first place.

It going hard today's kids. want see us survive this, know? effect going definitely worth discussing though, going deal effecting next generation.

He also said plainly ""you die wearing mask. wear two masks 8-10 hours time colleagues""

We're opening small in-person services next week, stated plainly masks required entry building times service.

We need community leaders like him. called ducking ""resurgence"" party ffs. Unless test 100% population track whereabouts, always reported. Yeah, 1,500 pediatricians UK know American Academy Pediatricians? bet bunch Trump loving conspiracy theorists. needs science tell us fears insecurities guide me. July 4th ""fallout"" still 11 days away.

if cases dropped today.. would still 3-4 weeks ***minimum***.

&amp;#x200B;

and Rt keeps going - cases dropping least bullshit. bar two day exam forces folks sit room together hours time. 

This spokesperson shitty. need find alternative bar time around. Yeah, that’s always option, could go back dunking like witch trials. keep em water till change minds... believe masks they’ll float. not.. well.. next! great question. Thanks asking! Torah strict rules called 'laws' mandate cleansing,food prep, hygiene, illness contact/quarantine, meat processing,which foods 'clean' unclean,circumcision.... lots others kept Isreal healthy wide portion world history otherwise would made susceptible virus, bacteria illness cultures rampant.

Stay safe, wear mask. Hopefully Oxford get done October depends whether fit tested N95 mask. Without fit testing, might provide zero protection. Highest while, time.

But clear trend upwards. Reasonably likely. U.S. hospitals need make money. ICU capacity sits empty. capacity expect use.

The U.S. 1 ICU bed every 3,000 people. run quickly crisis. expect crisis hit half states once. ""resurgence"" party bunch vaccine denying Trump cultists repurchase snake oil treat children? math. *Hurricane force COVID* Sorry misunderstood comment! agree saying. definitely questions virus:

1. local spread little (any?) deaths middle flu season China looked for, identified novel pneumonia-causing virus. Why? 

2. China's early reaction virus extreme. Lockdowns, street fumigation, mobile hospitals...again really many infections. Why? 

3. China never experienced spread outside Wuhan area, despite spreading least 2 months completely unchecked? Why? 

4. rest Asia, even poorest rural parts, extreme population density, really experience spread. Why? 

5. northern Italy suffer badly southern Italy not? 

6. ruling-class people gotten gotten easily? Even elderly ones? 

7. NYC badly hit stopped appear re-surging, even little, rest country does? New Yorkers vacationing East Coast, would expected least uptick would happen. vaccines maintain efficacy several years. don’t know single vaccine requires bi-monthly boosters maintain efficacy immunity. Given know, perhaps right course action put hands say ""must God's will; let happen"" instead actively fight towards stopping virus tracks return normalcy? Deaths lag behind. hospitals start hit saturation, spike. give couple weeks start seeing record number deaths. Canada TV _full_ US news, everyone seeing dumpster fire South every minute day, help people stay united disease. really, I'm saying is: welcome, Canada. member science team. credientials [about everyone take look judge themselves.

Like WTF... Like down-vote even bother answering question? People assume hostility based Hillary's name mentioned looooool comes one ever heard before? Sounds like game changer. That's crap. kids, want work home. Also, tons people Reddit kids. Grow fuck up. Great, spike US. Good, teachers unions lot leverage right leading opposition boneheaded pushes reopen schools worst outbreak. Yup def need enforcement actually work. repercussions empty words. NJ suffered pretty badly early still people still dont take seriously. Good news people regain within two weeks. people take longer unfortunately. happened almost two weeks ago. started regaining one nostril, reason US simultaneous Wuhans going right Phoenix, San Antonio, Houston, Miami. places wait line 8 hours get test. 

So doubt it.

The hospitals Houston test ANYONE comes in. Come stubbed toe? get tested. 

47% people coming non-covid stuff testing positive.

Source: Dogs already valuable allies❤️🦮 Never talk partners getting tested prior meeting/doing anything eh? Somehow always left out.  fire you. Tell me, fired company refused tell why, would press charges fired illegal reason? “First, don’t proof guy smoking gun shot victim.”

Hospitals aren’t peak capacity *very* strained right now. current load much higher what’s typical getting worse every day amount daily hospitalizations continues climb. 

Also, let’s forget nurse shortage that’s getting exacerbated need quarantine nurses get infected. place lay someone doesn’t equate able give care. don’t think Trudeau done nearly enough regarding Canada’s indigenous peoples. 

Aside that, think Conservatives don’t understand, don’t want understand, Trudeau left wing people actually dislike. Basically, tend like says says it, tend general agreement regarding policy implementation policy, think he’s incredible privileged, generally lacking awareness can’t trusted really stupid things. example, wore black face (whichever time), vacationed Aga Khan, grabbed person floor Parliament, put position tied government giving large amounts money charity associated with. 

He’s comes across nice guy strives right thing, dumb bag hammers. Conservatives really wanted drive wedge Canadians, they’d focus poor personal judgment. Instead, they’re like “warble-garble DEFICIT” us left like “...so?” Back 80's dated great girl whose dad pastor. church part underground railroad would help refugees Salvadoran Civil War get Canada. Breaking law believed faith called help suffering. That's something see Christians everyday. course can't advertise see churches advocating refugees undocumented majority especially South racist Old Testament types think really considered Christians follow Christ anyway say going heaven ""accepted Lord Savior."" Magic words magical thinking a**holes. they've co-opted word Christian mean people like agree everything do. sad. like child 99 peers. add things like ""what best friend ate it?"" on. Interesting. suspect reason cases continued climb post-lockdown due largely infections within family units spreading family members well spread among essential service people, grocery shoppers scofflaws. 

Makes sense. case decline continues despite releasing constraints, suggests major offender social system still muted lockdown. 

The schools - doubtful. 

Could pubs.. busy, definitely back normal, plus nightclubs opened yet either. there's anywhere Ireland close social interaction extremely hampered packed bars nightclubs. We'll know weeks - it'll full swing July 20th.. one biggest piss ups country seen years. Per source, ""100% normal ICU beds occupied 62% surge capacity ICU beds occupied"". hospitalization rate TMC tripled month deaths lagging stat behind this...

Educate yourself. say anything God. want read way, that's you. Offer poke holes condoms. vaccine require boosters often? flu shot get year (as mutates strains coming vary) others may need boosters number years....but none need bimonthly boosters. joke. personal protest elections whether write candidates allowed not, write name. may may send message try accept consequences.

Edit words, edit words Tests. Don't. Always. Work.

How fuck stupendously dim? Agreed, subject matter pandemic currently afflicting us, evidence suggesting precautions taken assumed true proven otherwise. Better safe sorry Schools given funding based number students have.  Per head.  That’s one reasons take attendance. 

If students still remote learning, still count. 

If forced go in-person classes, parents withdraw home school instead, longer enrolled local school school gets less funding. that’s large portion students, that’s large portion budget.

Did explain okay?  try find info.  message Dan Patrick: ""its grandma grandpa, sacraficing alter capitalism, chill!"" ive always blood doner excersizing listening pandora heard ad red cross needed blood crisis. thought idea saving life like noped fuck that. dont want run kind risk... might forgotten put sign reminded them. realize people wearing masks months, wearing far longer it’s hard habit break. I’ve done couple times myself. recognize necessity mask use public problem wearing one, sometimes forget sign reminds me.

IDK assume people assholes go back get mask. simple mistake kinder assumption. honest right mostly focusing COVID related articles. I'll add internal list potential articles review. much likely cause haha. need take desp breath stop following political narratives son.

There source data regarding whether restaurants, bars protests played role. health regions policies place specifically inquire COVID postive patients attended BLM protests. 

LA county experienced highest case load yesterday, photo area two weeks ago, time frame cases would transmitted. honestly say gatherings like play role dishonest. 


The US turned covid crisis political talking point. political left hell bent denying BLM protests played role putting antivaccers shame ignorance. 

The US also biggest idiot ever hold office sitting Whitehouse election year. way crisis amplified contorted diminish reelected going pursued. certainly scale RNC, TRC (Texas Republican Convention) still supposed held, IN-PERSON, San Antonio beginning next week. anyone think/say that's good idea??? cluster.... 20 minute test given city? isn’t news guess finally decided go mayor Phoenix said public health department.

If first press confetence had, embarrassing. Mayor right. might well one. It’s definitely scary. wish everyone would take seriously. Yeah, called /r/Coronavirus Keep mind religions around wern't exactly benign religions. (Such worship Moloch) would include child sacrifice. Combine fact really government area would consider it. kill killed time. another tribe problem worked one tribes going end dead enslaved. take prisoner (how hell feed them?) let go would gather strength come back fight again. 

Sometimes forget much safer world back then. Staying away certain people groups good preventative measure any. Notably importantly, conservative governments parties. issues, issue least. There's much ""masks tyranny"" group going here. exist, margins.

Doug Ford particular decent job. Florida needs claim Myrtle Beach own.  Sadly, yes did. Teachers need prepared strike come Aug, one work unsafe conditions contribute spread covid community babysitting covid+ kids day. Awesome, thanks! 😀 would fine students staff going campus semester. say 30 million 100 million Canada handled coronavirus outbreak better US, anyone rational says. needs tweet it. Schools money tax base state collapsed. police officers going around saying ""That ain't job."" I've around pretty intense shit life I've seen lot death. worry poor hospital staff hit worst part PTSD: action died left sit thoughts saw faces sounds never forget.

Not trying make all, can't imagine blow taken anyone working hospital, MDs room cleaners. really feel them. know current research says, viral load matter immensely severity?

If, that's big if, filter could drop viral loads noticeable amount, would probably less severe cases, still build *some* immunity. Yes, covid! Yes, I've seen study estimating masks alone lockdowns alone, even strong lockdowns.

I'm trying collect studies evidence effectiveness masks. know some? Especially cancer, obesity rare autoimmune disorder Ah yes cherry pick 3 million cases 30 million actual infections 9% total population.

Yet hundred churches exercising constitutional rights gather that's gets focus, yeah bias whatsoever. pro-BLM / Pantifa narrative allowed leftist echo-chamber called Reddit though. Pathetic.

The bias thick, painfully obvious hypocrisy dripping totally oblivious it, go along whatever allowed narrative time, shoveled MSM. critical thinking anymore.

Think i'm joking narrative? Look garbage article:

Nobody ever changed mind talked put defensive. way change someones mind ask “why feel way”. importantly need actually listen answer Far away herd immunity... might true, also true PCR tests going needed less future major infection peak passed antibody tests likely needed entire population point. Ding ding ding, winner! that's entirely true: virus survive mutate become less deadly reasons pointed out.

but virus also mutate become deadly, point dead end, evolutionarely speaking, stay around bring people infected. ""Laborare necesse est, vivere non est necesse"" whole reason curve exploded reopen push manipulating data Tennessee, Georgia, Florida among confirmed states willingly misrepresented data withheld data order reopen economies. cities packed protests riots high numbers corona virus cases... even democrat mayors acknowledge this.

I’m quite sure I’m following you... protests indeed spike considering infectious virus is... spread friends family coworkers customers...

New York literally exception obvious reasons previous hot doctor says drink anymore put SSRIs ensure drink due bad reactions....

Oh lord....

Challenge accepted, buddy....  guess would interesting know many attending churches. I'd assume busy say restaurant bar Oh no! Reactionaries suffering consequences actions. 

I sure hope there's lethal pandemic near future. 

It sure would shame people dragging rest society backwards implacable ideological views died rapidly. 'Anyone wants test test, like you.'

..... one make furnace joke... Herd immunity may horizon come December rate Bullshit last close. Arkansas never even bothered we're pay serious price it. Spreading coronavirus, bad, still harmless thing Catholic Church involved shit!!! Meanwhile Moscow big cities people blatantly ignoring mask laws physical distancing measures, cramming top eachother grocery store like bunch fucking herd animals neither employees government give shit, we're 6+k cases every day acting like already extra-responsible ""preparing second wave"".  think mean like godly god-tier speed. words, extremely fast contact tracing, stop infections truly spread. many lies plain see people would use common sense think they're hearing reading.

We many people die county since first COVID-19 case mid-March. But, 5 C-19 deaths. every single death attributed C-19, 5 deaths? one big lies they're telling. think deaths probably underreported since JAMA article saying death rate pneumonia 122,000 US period months compared average time frame last decade. It’s police. unarmed enforcers facing same. power enforce? ‘You arent wearing mask, writing ticket. What’s name?’ ‘Eff you’ ‘ok well... good day’ Looks like fudging state data backfired it?

Maybe Alabama bar requires someone check teeth, like horse? Romania first place European Union new cases coronavirus registered last 24 hours, given Wednesday cases coronavirus detected Romania, since beginning pandemic: 555.
If Romania weeks number cases increasing, several countries real unwanted records terms COVID-19 cases, decrease infections.

The average daily infections July 2-8 411 Romania, 5th week constant increases

According National Institute Public Health, last 24 hours country Europe cases registered Romania Great Britain, 581 new cases. Great Britain longer part European Union, say Romania cases coronavirus detected 24 hours, France (which 475 cases), Germany (391), Spain (341) Italy (137).
In conditions, surprising European countries introduce restrictions travel conditions Romanians. recent example Austria. Thus, Romanians arrive country quarantined two weeks prove negative test COVID-19.

There already least ten states either receive Romanian tourists all, keeping borders closed time being, put conditions them, force stay quarantine isolation 14 days. I’m “Not Safe Work” content.

Feeling disappointed. clear mind made up, someone helped run business state like yours, easy fire people, people file lawsuits employers time. employers not, would not, blatantly disregard federal law. think sound like someone wronged assume employers looking screw people over, case. employers want good employees want keep happy, would risk lawsuit something trivial ill child. sister got test today. told 6+ days results. 

But time mom, stepdad, sister, BF could also fall ill. 

There's way contact trace get ahead turnaround times like this.

Greed kills. propose put hands say ""must God's will""? I'm going report clearly deranged imbecile words. may well report village idiot trying fuck doorknob.

My position clear:

If guaranteed potentially deadly pathogen carrier break quarantine, go jail.

If refuse wear mask, go jail.

2. Nobody calling suspension First Amendment, use responsibly global pandemic killed 100,000 Americans, i.e. wear damn mask.

It’s economy. feel like better advice ""don't sex strangers pandemic"" rather ""take precautions sex strangers pandemic"". Hm. says testing could factor explain cases. Also says firing lockdown social events since resumed, could transmission last month. Young healthy people literally dying strokes caused neither healthy ways living life fuck immune system? DJ Khaled would say, DA BEST I've months... actual source posted NY post link undermined claim hospitals overwhelmed. Also, since anecdotal evidence disallowed, cut whole ""doctors nurses said this"", especially since actual source agree you

And yes scientific source would validate claim CDC diagnosis guidelines create Covid19 exist. would epidemiology study, highly relevant crisis. need actual trained epidemiologist interpret statistical testing data.

You even linked problematic (to you) testing criteria, baldly asserted it. said contributed inflated numbers, would huge, except scientific paper alleges it, reputable journalist reported it. doctors nurses whistleblowers apparently dont speak major news outlets, even Fox news downplaying entire pandemic from.the start. entire theory many leaps logic, many bald assertions, even theory, hodgepodge assertions trivia change every time.

Would explain lot really dumb comments you’re making. Sure definitely know possible, also keep mind antibody study antibodies part immune system. [T cells B cells also guarantee immunity, studies shown pretty good response disease around like 6 months still really seen significant signs reinfection, reach 30m-100m confirmed cases figure definitely significant amount least short term immunity. Maybe schools need sick ward children watched, parents go work. seems easier squeezing sick leave employers parents. Parents use school free daycare. people ride sitting behind screamer go cloud screamed air. land faces hands breathed in. hear massive lawsuit cases? charge kid dies school? teacher dies school? put $ sign people's lives?

I understand you’re saying someone who’s states people attending churches praying MIRACLE “destroy virus”, word doesn’t sit well either. 

There’s context meanings words too. Arizona, Texas Florida report 30% ICU patients coronavirus cases. majority ailments.
Look Mick, 76 years old, living California. I'm excited prospect catching bug. blessed good health pretty good physical condition. Two friends son recovered virus. One May one June. claim would wish anyone. take pandemic seriously. like unnecessary hype unscientific politicalization problem.
You know Donald Trump stepped office tomorrow would end coronavirus. supply masks don’t want breathing germs I’m willing pay that. Naw, mods deleting comment incivility called cockwomble, repeatedly banned hoping people would die. place cesspit, going round circles clearly mental health screwed over.

I mean....shit, hope grandma gets covid dies rape corpse. (Do us favour, report me). thought same: [Not onion worries!!! Take care :) Chapter 3 - widespread covid help spread. need testing kits workers! smaller particles likely still air minutes later.Imagine fine particles dust long linger air. particles light enough slight airflow keeps lifted air, minutes long. Lord God offended excrement, fuck give asshole? Disneyland unfair! Mickey Mouse there! Totally agree.

A unfair society.

When USA believe many tramps hanging around streets. shocked me.  based favipiravir, Avigan. latter gets mentioned sub while. Uh. think case, different though. baker make cake mixed race couple's wedding goes baker's philosophy, would ok? 

It refusing service person shirt shoes example.

In case mask, also general public's health well. Islam contains explicit clauses stating starving forbidden food available eat that, bad stuff claims happen eat forbidden food apply case. I'm wondering go watch it. hear press fiesty today.... ridiculous, considering 1% kids die coronavirus, closer 0.001. Wait people bag groceries from? That's peculiar Ooh, good call. yeah, MM/DD. updated text eliminate ambiguity. Even congressional hearings saw Fauci take mask speak. really needs better communication - mask catches droplets produce talking, therefore pretty important wear talking. people dummies. let be. ANYTHING FREE TAKE IT! Adds yet another effective way spread virus taking seriously.

At point, forget herd immunity. aiming “stupid probability”, meaning enough idiots taking virus seriously get ill know others do, collectively finally start taking virus seriously. end, protects everyone taking seriously start.

And honestly, HUGE head start “stupid probability”. see window every day Texas. We’re getting closer closer day. It’s beautiful. /s sure you’re downvoted; overall excess mortality end measured historians, reported cases.

USA excess mortality roughly 28% Mar 1 May 31st according [this study published Jul numbers arent available real time method use measure places like Florida [may grossly reporting friend quitting retail management job nothing else lined disgusting people started act wear piece cloth face mins.

Multiple physical threats violence day, people breaking stuff anger, countless amounts verbal abuse America's brightest. I'm pretty sure voters Arizona ones dropped Duece themselves. Owners theme parks want money. Yep.....and books listed describe tactic......they much aware control behavior......think batterer gets sh!t together cops pull acts cool til leave...they manipulate. yet, death toll going down. underlying conditions, elderly, absolutely, stay safe, isolate quarantine, wear mask whatever. rest world moving on, usual. CDC even considering lowering status epidemic, vs. pandemic. LA stopped reporting holiday upgrade systems. created backlog reports. can. Go ahead. person needs go ER immediately. Forget Covid, concerning symptoms anyone reason. false positives going nowhere even close 50%. doubt 5% that's generous. ""suspected cases"" definitely included confirmed case count. theories suspected cases included death toll, true, that's big if, find alarming, considering highly infectious virus is. 

And last point, countries absolutely reduced testing stopped entirely. exact opposite. Countries virus control ramped testing, ramping contact tracing prevent future outbreaks. one statement made accurate [bye bye There's feeling Serbia ""cooking books"" along. 

One month ago, Hungary opened borders travel neighboring countries (Austria, Slovenia, Czech Republic, Slovakia), Serbia. Honestly, takes contain pandemic far **everyone** gets tested **everyone** that’s positive quarantines. possibility test whole population virus would contained less month without close anyrhing... bad I’ve seen articles like months still globally available watched lecture/program plague. Jews rules storing grain sweeping houses. fewer rats running around neighborhoods less likely get plague. Yeah, problem. one studies published identifying virus interacts ACE2 receptors. medical press release goes detail COVID interracting ACE2 receptors wreak havoc bodily systems causing blood cells leak- ACE2 keeps leakage-substance control body regulate itself, COVID zaps ACE2 receptor, leakage goes control, lungs fluid, bodily parts swell, etc. 

That specific example things go wrong ACE2 receptors one many. another press release/publication half physicians describing they're seeing, half medical information inform reader what's actually going on. 

For reading highly recommend r/COVID19 focuses medical publications. lot hard understand still check time time try keep relatively date :)  Yes numbers delayed scattered recorded, wouldn’t hard tell actually rate deaths? everyone knows someone dies covid, people something. America First! Greg Abbott still hasn’t closed down, downsized restaurant capacity 50% shut bars... family members, several members church including pastor got sick... church suddenly closed without telling anybody may contact positive cases... pastor last heard hospitalized. desperate getting tithe. many also carpool work company 15-pax vans well. mostly funny know ghost stories. dont, sadly. Probably, yeah. they're friends though think I'm willing give benefit doubt. Nowadays everybody wanna talk like got something say

But nothing comes move lips

Just bunch viruses

The motherfuckers act like forgot masks

...

So say somebody hate?

Or anyone trying bring Covid way?

Wanna resolve things bloodier way? 

Just study tape NWA

(I need hobby) really wild said connect dots plan seems Gaslight, lie, manipulate information pray vaccine created election date. That's really thing he's got left card he's willing play cares himself. absolutely maddening  It’s virus it’s gonna spread. parents said me. know it’s getting everyone literally think nothing Seriously. 

They way people act, you'ld think alcohol easily available (and cheaper) outside fucking bar. cannot believe sociopathic people understand seeing kind slow epicurve. FDA commissioner said diag. 1 20 cases moment leaves us 700,000 cases per day leaves almost everyone infected like 200 days already 140+ days in. Florida saying 1 100 COVID? seeing drop ? Party people went got sick recovered died, older pops thing. Also herd taskforce wondering many states south stable weeks reopen simaltainously exploded cases still investigating.. realize mass protests ? ""seems plausible"" zero information judge by.

We've plenty information judge it. know family viruses in. SARS-COV-2 shares 79% genetic make SARS-COV (aka SARS). causes symptoms similar SARS. similar enough SARS people infected SARS resistance SARS-COV-2. There's evidence persists body long term like herpes HIV. big enough difference allow beaches open, right? FYI hell lot lack mask compliance equal hundred churches, wear masks anyway. younger infected population, possibly weaker virus, better treatment Texas getting hit 3-4 months Positive experiences roommates rare come I've read really lucked there! Yeah, lot horror stories. seem kind unbelievable normal person know definitely real. People dont know happens hospitals. really is. really hard get better hospital. TV show hospitals arent reality. Like tv quiet there, patients sleeping, beeping, crowded rooms.
Not all! first hospitalization eye opener sure (in ward dementia patients). said, want help feel better cannot lay trying watch tv feeling awful. plan living old mostly experiences watching family get old.
Not gonna happen me! LOL. 

So far escaped Corona. asthma 3 immunosuppressant drugs crohns gonna get me, maybe ticket 😆
I definitely live long happens.
Be careful wish guess eh lol.
Hope well too. need add building fund never seems enough money. protests major source right ?If abortion clinics closed would screaming state removed rights. can't go church 5 months, right, faith home. abstaining sex then, get pregnant, makes sense huh?? Well, else would make large donation stale crackers juice? God kills mysterious ways! 

Im religious I’m reminded old religious joke. 

A man sailing ocean boat capsizes. clinging floating wreckage days. One day boat comes attempts rescue says “don’t worry it, god save me” next day another boat tries pick says thing. “God save me”. next day helicopter shows waves away saying “god save me” 

Next day guy dies gets heaven asks god didn’t save him? 

God says, “I sent two boats fucking helicopter, want?” Yes Sweden say symptom free two weeks get meaningful antibody test Discordianism makes *no* promises, asks money, keeps promises! Paper cloth *Over there* extremely important.  30% decided anything guy Really? What's lockdown?  English desperately needs word ""one hundred thousand"". handy. Ohhh gotcha “This new normal. new reality,” Josh D’Amaro, Disney’s theme park chairman, said interview. “Covid here, responsibility figure best approach safely operate new normal.” we're happily sitting cocoon, imported case seem paint shitstorm that's going outside borders.

Makes MCO worth it.  sad US become Trump needs come say we're going herd mentality. Cause right US emulating Swedish model without people knowing health system Sweden does. think they'll able keep winter? Distanced, outdoor dining seems working pretty well now, I'm curious kind outdoor adaptations implement weather gets worse. 

Hopefully Europe able stay top things, maybe safe go back inside there. I'm US optimistic. Actually, that’s exactly I’m saying. Obesity 100% control person eating. medically scientifically impossible obese without consuming excess calories. 

Obese people far worse medical outcomes essentially every condition including COVID-19, cancer, diabetes, heart disease, etc, one cares health, makes sense control weight. 

Especially time pandemic access health care strained. steamroller? gonna measure dicks next?

Who outside sub gives fuck upvotes? think ridiculous article adds myth virus. what? Income based repayment thing planning stick around US anyway, difference make pay debt? choice lol oh, dont get wrong... mean, totally wrong express better, say article clearly states actual reason claim, mostly ranting usual statement black, latino, asian, etc ""more prone affected"" virus (something idiotic also circulating here).

Again, absolutely bad Wait opened economy? telling making bullshit proclamation forcing places open convince everyone start traveling? 

Did forget entire fucking world watching USA implode banning us coming? 

Great time cut unemployment../s There's also assumption schools reopening identical schools last fall, terms benefits provide students.

But...how schools fall *possibly* like schools last fall? Even places schools forced open without precautions, teachers still behave differently underlying issue pandemic remain. children get benefits terrified staff come within six feet them, fellow students blaming intra-school spread virus?

What's going happen kid kids decide one spread virus killed Susie's mom?

Edit: schools reopening is, unfortunately, likely least bad option. going able avoid damage pandemic children whether go school, children smarter seem think are. another fantasy people entertaining avoid reality.  287,000 NEW cases per day India alone +50% rest world seeing today, America hit new record 60,000+ daily. But, thought much testing? little trumpy hypocritical, comes safety gargoyles mean leaders party?  Please say ain't so! Haha, hand I'm Canadian absolutely love British commercials. like variety quaint usually are. American commercials worst Canadian ones sort between. ITT - Folks unironically eager tell different caring megachurch is. state Texas finally put mask requirement place 3rd, however excludes churches places worship.  gets Christian churches that...like, yes, things mentioned, also big part belief system knowing loving Jesus.

I'd say terms risk attending, churches even worse examples, people attending bars clubs tend young relatively healthy, although still demonstrated risk associated younger people contracting virus terms severe complications mortality, younger people tend fare better virus. Churches literally packed elderly people, often health conditions, mortality rate Covid soars 60. folks literally gambling lives pastors priests encouraging it. bars didn’t open people needed go them; opened pay shitload taxes alcoholic beverage sales supplied distributors powerful political force states. kinda mask?

And believe NYC ""Churchland"" even stupider thought- that's saying something. Death rates look far less scary:

But rare people know someone one conditions.

We prevalent mask use even need discussion rare exceptions. Toronto high Asian population too, yet still got hit hard.

-Professor Farnsworth guy biological bunker safe possibly individual without even using mask. really something see people like lead back everyone enough danger is. sad see actually local governments brain fail slowly help guidance White House. United States big country. something like 328 million people spread area larger China twice size India (yes, know Alaska distorts stuff). aggregating data together puts deaths per 100k quite lower lot European countries. looking deaths nationally instructive looking states/regional areas.

Take state New York example. 32,243 deaths spread among population 19.45 million. per capita basis equals 164 deaths per 100,000. triple amount per capita Italy twice big UK. 

Serious shit look local level instructive considering at. doubt regional level, Texas, Arizona, Florida start exceeding per capita rates European countries unless take action. 

Hopefully wrong. Masks. Distancing. Constant cleaning. Limiting number visitors. employees get sick shut store down. groceries stores, top that, essential services.

Besides which, know super spreader locations? need groceries, best can.

It's clear whataboutist trol. post replies people read them. Feel free collect trol pay. impossible predict, studies released last month indicating antibodies generally detectable short term (a months infection) level antibodies may lower patients milder cases bode well herd immunity. protests good rise. Even piling stores looting. Great! keep going rate heard immunity ❤️❤️😊  Freedom speech still nice thing strive for. Yep. Prisoners, incarcerations, unemployment, believe teen pregnancies, we're number 1!!!!! 🇺🇸 Freedom speech anything allowing say want reddit. federal response Trudeau matched provincial responses various governments, including Doug Ford 's Conservative government Ontario. really kind polarization response seeing US, outside fringe elements. Heck, must seen recent headlines... 81% Canadians support keeping border closed, 2/3rds would want country shut cases spike. Much uniform society comes pandemic response. Masks mandated across municipalities, people welcome it. not. cancel debt owed China China pay them.

That's risky lending money undeveloped countries. Except except select schools operate football programs net loss. Picks two words response invalidate whole thing. It’s hard scientific study people collecting information aren’t allowed ask variable studied part equation. Thanks though. Maybe could answer second part question then? protests riots weren’t covid threat can’t outdoor professional sporting events resume? can’t go NFL game thousand people thousand people take streets disregard “rules” entirely? wouldn’t fit narrative right? anti masket cases animals. They're children God highly religious vowing care others help sick...

The guy passed onto brother ended getting mom killed SARS-2...so moms taking chances. simple argument is: knowing refuse wear mask proven got sick died, fault prosecuted premeditated murder. Summer school American problem humanity problem wrong, people want grandstand politically, antilockdown BLM protests terrible ideas. BLM protests obviously skewed younger much likely could become asymptomatic mild carriers would feel reason get tested. addition reopenings lack sanity many plans, fact crappy testing finally getting somewhat tell true scope what's going on.  reading data masks. also means getting info less savoury places. Good luck anyone explanation Sweden's drop coronavirus deaths? Chart going [new seem almost absurdly low. Knowing death lagging indicator, suggests almost deaths little time (assuming Swedish behavior changed numbers modified by, say, reporting standards sort thing). seen anything strict lockdown Sweden. Anyone know what's going on? really fair though. large(r) company without strong cash reserves gets PPP loan 60% goes back employees 40% building costs (like program designed) may help company weather storm, keep staff save jobs thus saving local economy. say company lot cash reserve 200 employees mom pop shop 10 employees community, one benefits people community better saved loan? Saving larger company, paying 200 staff funds helps LOT more. 

&amp;#x200B;

Also remember amount loan based companies payroll previous 12 months. designed basically cover 2 months avg payroll. companies would eligible loan, smaller one apply small amount.

&amp;#x200B;

A better test save companies would review balance sheet without cash reserves equity cover payroll moved front line, speak. large cash reserves dip them, point going strictly company size woudl disaster hte economy even mess caused already.

Let's hope 7-8% accurate - high, CFR gets lot uglier.) merely anti-lockdown protests. Vucic election total turnout 102% voters. 

Protests corruption, stolen election, etc. 

Btw, Vucic minister information Milosevics government. still around cell Hague question here.  reason cases aren’t currently increasing testing capacity can’t keep up. Positive rate tests still increasing 25%

Lol state G0P trying act like Houston screwed doesn’t allow this, come guys Houston, don’t need convention. Oof. really bad gastro issues back February. think coronavirus maybe was. can't sure definitely sick I've entire life.

I can't imagine symptoms *and* difficulty breathing. also work. know several people age group gotten (I'm 35) they've ended boat others turning positive jobs. better look data terms 5-10 day rolling averages. average deaths per day US around 500, 2500 peak. Thats average death rate. mean 5% people infected tens millions. think people refuse deviate perceived norm ""it way"" special type dense. That's alot ask chickens. Also weird call ""students"" ¿Porqué los dos? still take care kids exist somehow. closed mindedness insane. People fixated ""Fauci lied"" also seem idea scientific process works. Hypothesis, studies, learning new information.

Seriously, one arguments see regarding masks - oh Fauci said this. least Fauci admitted wrong corrected position lot courageous credible many others demonstrated thus far. need Atalanta win champions League fairytale ending That's correct, 3M increase production least double April, that's still far shorter demand. guess people assume I'm doubting statement people dying covid home un-diagnosed, definitely case. gonna really interesting especially we're starting deal rural poor areas country. people may health care readily available, either due actual physical lack access financial. There's lot people can't catch bus county hospital means get otherwise. Many hunker hope best unfortunately.  provinces federal leaders worked together worked well. also listened scientists say. yeah, common sense.  country normalcy masks out. 

Very countries ""lockdown"" strict, talking about? South Korea Taiwan lockdown they've best responses pandemic. countries lite lockdowns highly effective.

 think wear mask zoo theme parks :( 

And bad because...? Retailers: hire private security enforce laws. sort no-win situation Trudeau. many said, react strongly Coronavirus, probably good outcomes get blamed causing economic turmoil ""nothing"". fail respond appropriately, get ravaged virus, tens thousands perish, economy still go free fall. 

Given two options, though, first one clearly better choice: damaged economy fewer deaths. right-wingers him. fortunate examples like USA, Sweden, Brazil, UK (though Scotland) compare contrast. American thing read here. Turns wasn’t. supposedly ~600 ""surge beds"". beds physically staff remains mystery. Either way, surge beds get filled soon rate going.  Plus there's probably close dozen NE states can't go without 2-week quarantine return. Bahrain country, really densely populated compared US states.

Arizona 57 people/sq mi,

South Carolina 157/sq mi

Wow. Teachers confined space entire day children champions hygeine. kids come families think virus hoax, send kids sleepovers camps whatever, could easily bring classroom infect kids teachers. Schools house hundreds thousands children faculty members. Many even ventilated well. 

Masks mandatory young kids, chances infection also go up. seen kids sneeze, share, interact? think going comply rules? Adults can’t even bothered follow along. 

Inner city schools tough spot. Classrooms crowded. Teachers leaving industry. Retirement rates jump depending states handle returns classroom.

None factors relatable grocery store. Many workers work shorter shifts open spaces. Many grocery stores installed plexiglass customer. interactions there, physically, minimal. 

Anyone wants best kids teachers want reopening schools handled well, far, case. 

I could dive much deeper, reason? points don’t make anyone second guess scenario hand, point going further. 

How schools handled Fall major impacts everything. Well yes US nearly 10x population Canada. get Master’s make livable wage. First teaching job, made $37,000 year. America: Must nice. fact B seems better choice ones charge right now, tells lot low right come. least always economic ideas, mostly bullshit retoric, least totally based ignorance hate. sexist side tho.... took time write numbers didn’t even include source. I’m pretty skeptical would taken tiny fraction time post got info comparing long took type that. Stop listening forecasters. wrong every step way. 

Wear mask. Wash hands. Avoid close contact strangers even wearing mask. maybe importantly, don’t listen alarmists honest I’m really sure Americans mostly agreement. Unfortunately, power listening using common sense. America take care citizens, forcing many parents NEED schools reopen work provide food shelter children. 

This year extremely eye opening dismal future country is. always knew government little us, watching happened last five months sickening. Rural Virginia, handling virus better I'm sure last places opening over. Summer southern US unbearably hot outside... virus won’t survive there... conditions also uncomfortable people...so spend time enclosed air conditioned places; virus thrives— especially shared spaces. Pence update seem take hard stance Trump. Valid point risk children. Aka bad parents schools do.the social work, single parents work. seem push hard Trump acknowledge bad states probably would defund. Possible may put Trump Looney bin replace Pence. Still republican maybe work with. hospitalization rate \~10%. survive virus mean fine afterwards. mention lot patients survive going bankrupted medical bills. general terms, probably good idea students leave PhD program. colleges absolutely rape students exorbitant tuition, long overdue close mess. I'm immigrant know ICE threatening kick international college students taking classes online fall. put college students (not international ones) danger universities unprepared forced hold physical classes lose international student income. ones refuse outright endanger international students kicking country. 

More info matter:  GRANDMARINOS!! else would show virtuous conformist am!? Current estimates I've seen put us 200k+ Nov 1. 53 days end August, meaning ""only"" need ~1.2k dead/day hit mark (we're ~134k dead currently). 1point3Acres us +622 deaths yesterday, given recent spikes expect number change rapidly soon stay way while. Dang I’ve trying piss people I’ve keeping pants on....total rookie move morons. 2% critics, 87% users Totally agree! sure people understand science actually works. lot science educated hypothesis scientists/researchers get knowledge previous studies updated reflect new information. Italy told us ""act now,"" would next. took precautions, locked down. long enough. look us! We're Italy! this, Canada US one - fuck Bruins. NY schools start Labor Day, late year. said, NY plenty time see happens states school starts fall term end July/early August. don’t doubt Cuomo pull plug in-person classes openings result cases.

Not mention question money coming social distancing, extra custodial staff nightly disinfecting, transportation multiple socially-distanced runs busses get kids school. thought spring stressful- fall way worse. difference area. Home Depot felt like scary mess Lowes felt calm orderly. still mask-less customers Lowes, employees least masked. woman hovering self checkout disinfecting constantly. Nope, think lockdowns originally worth flatten curve prep hospitals/PPE. Which, recall, original message behind lockdowns, achieved. Case rates always going spike point, even slowed vaccine.

And think masks mandated public indoor spaces everywhere next several months due easy virus transmit somewhere 2 3 times lethal flu since vaccine.

I also acknowledge sky falling believing things. whole time I've thinking film 'The Day Earth stood still' professor talks humanity precipice we'll change. Probably not, I’ll post article that. two, one 3 months old. Meanwhile, handed TRILLIONS companies people need money. like even liberal states want cross Rubicon.

they're old... feel like afraid tbh. Easy, team relationship place danger loose vital chit-chat shitshow office people won’t need remember message important matters. Oh position essential around people.

/s tho received quite „similar” explanation large? Manifestations? Where? impactful would one megacorp would sustained period time would end hurting business employees long run, that's even could tell real impact economy outside future unemployment.

Now get fucks sign that. Protestant Reformation 2? Indulgences? Miracles?! first bit right, never circled back. 😂 Yeah, got back average april 09, that's encouraging. Checks stock market. Still trending up. Vix flat. 

So we're still good push Live meme. 

/s Eat help brother /s state teach in, don’t mind asking? manage elect competent administration, guarantee costs covered government. continue shit show, it'll sure every person themselves. Yep.

But make normal people take notice, need shift average number funerals attended 1 3 4.

A sad reality.

This problem societally we’re grappling with: extreme tribalism self interest.

Annually US, 2.8 million people die. certain impact average survivor. survivor personally feels significant personally recognizable increase burden, they’ll ignore it. Except Alberta... Sheer wearing mask hes required to... 

Yea, conservative well Doug. I'm sure Bolsonaro would happy host GOP convention Brazil Oof, sorry hear that. :( Exactly. Instead leaving, pushed reform. unbelievable. country really broken. think *Diamond Princess* available. could moor Galveston let hold there, two-week quarantine end. July ***2021*** anyone confused.  Probably clue article Agency data showed 14 new COVID-19 deaths recorded Tuesday, bringing total 5,447, half occurred nursing homes among elderly receiving home care services.

Same NYC lot vulnerable population died first, probably less well ""self"" goverment protected.

Herd immunity switch, % population immune give slower rate transmission, point virus hard time infecting anybody (in high 80%s low 90%s virus)

Swedes probably high 20% - low 30% immunity now.  share would that? We're danger losing house I'm willing show help neighbors thrown street. even know people foreclosed on? like...bodily block house can't forcibly thrown out? work? 10 bucks says ingredient semen. Crazy people can't stop putting semen stuff. ....Or they’re staying home/avoiding hospitals don’t get virus. Yeah, elections . Remember happened Iran went hell? I'd rather see elections postponed reliable system remote voting implemented. Shit's hard...this article gave perspectives consider otherwise. Im fine quarantine thats hobby keeps teaching things, wife, two cats. didnt things, couldnt...it would different story. Yup. died little inside. already room? People dont stay teaching cause job zero respect horribly underpaid would need EVERY DAY EVERY PERSON, literally impossible, even wouldnt catch every case confirm I'm Arizona ICU right now. 9 codes one shift, rooms doubled patients. Nursing ratios higher That’s assuming even could get Florida’s deliberately shitty system work unfamiliar, [Dan Lieutenant Governor Texas talk radio host. responses pandemic actually *worse* governor's.

I’d prepare lesson plan would struggle classroom control sure ive definitely seen enough know goes on.

But thats irrelevant never said knew run classroom. wrong focused on. 

If youve class qualified judge happens one whether student teacher wither way classroom going on. Oh, see. explains everything! wonder U.S. 300x daily cases (200 vs 60,000). 10x population America. totally see America definitely worse Canada. That’s one place 2nd largest country earth. it’s population lower lot US states. 50,000 cases per day new normal........ surprising 50k now.

Soooo role reversal.

TLDR; colder north winter spring, people stayed inside, perpetuating spread, hot south summer, people stay inside w/ A/C, perpetuating spread. yep, know late....but still think nba season finish planned. bubble burst one day. doctors disagree him? place them?

Plus masked. even office contact unless necessary test ppe. issue ""the vast majority"" vague term I'm sure holds much water bars restaurants also ""supposed"" follow guidelines.

The smaller buildings can't survive 25% capacity add 6' distancing; church 100 people realistically going able fit 10-15 people truly following guidelines.

Then comes human factor. Even church leadership willing able maintain guidelines, takes one ""Karen"" pulling mask sing naught. 134,664 died.

Yes that’s correct. IFR ages 60 low finally protecting old vulnerable it’s likely won’t surge deaths.

Most: Fun explain proven evidence second infection yet discovery detectable antibodies seem start go away couple months. People listen pseudoscience, instead real science. Can't argue stupid, trust me. really sad. happen society? American, wish US would too. spreads. Dr Osterholm thinks seeing summer really typical decline like influenza. 

I thought since flattened curve summer, we'd little break. looks like thing spreads time let foot brake.

This actually good news second wave kicks ass would really even worse think. thing seems basically forest fire. strike match kindling many, many times anything really catches fire. does, hard control. think that's here. gonna keep pumping brakes we're going get natural waves beginning. man-made decreases while. think mis-characterized Lincoln's role able find wikipedia. Yes, let find info get chance message you! chances young person ending ICU close 0%. Notice didn’t say 0%, said “close 0%.

Any virus cause young person go ICU, doesn’t mean it’s common. doesn’t seem common COVID either (based CDC) data. Maybe realize far denominations fractal down. understanding something like Catholic church local churches various sizes forms global network effectively based Italy. Similarly, Baha'i faith (which much smaller) community city-level forms global network effectively based Israel. Christian denominations really fractal far differ city-to-city? denominations really many perceived differences support even one city over? really appreciate insight I'm well-educated Christian denominations. friend daughter private school great great job moving online learning. really believe it’s dependent school &amp; offer support teachers. Chorizo! Chicharrones! Pollo Loco! plenty lobbying money, able use leverage. rural hospitals usually little critical care facilities. send patients need city hospitals. Meanwhile America... I'll happily say already said:

The lord provide... COVID-19 attending church. God exploited universe. like team R, then? someone wants go Infectious Diseases, is!! Could share image? I'm familiar it. unemployment benefits expire end month? true extension place, going explode.. mask enforcement Canada, community cases 20 days less 10% public wear employees major grocery outlets never required them.

The US vastly dangerously overstating efficiency cloth masks form source control expense social distancing. Many Americans seem think hazmat suits oblivious fact 90% particles still pass them. left deregulated kind insane rhetoric could passed fact ""news"" outlets. Italy.. China.. Report accounts like then. Reddit says report accounts appear inauthentic. NHL fan... could super interesting signing prospects I'd argue harder brainwash intelligent person brainwash idiot. Would first time. US airlines time worn tradition occasional bout bankruptcy, unfortunately. like people obey sex demands. Umm.. think that's way round, hospital's tend work better scale, different disciplines needed, rural ones tend basic bits bobs. 

Also metro area richer scale coming elective sugery, rural folks tend older break loose... irony hilarious well. wish Italy, home Catholic Church, complaining religious fanatics.

There plenty Catholics believe pro-choice science; don’t make headlines usually we’re pretty chill aren’t calling strangers outside Planned Parenthood murderers. know many arguments made Christians Catholics, I’ll agree 100% lots problems stem religion, don’t speak us.  Hard tell long ago early 20's without context. 1960? 1940? 2015?

Just theater lines mean others don't. depends population density, theater capacity, go see movie. last time went movie winter holidays, probably skewed metric.

Either way, one complaints. literally value seeing something movie theater me. get what's appealing besides larger screen, big draw me.

I mean, even 5 minute drive hassle compared walking couch, live 20-30 minutes away movie theater. probably suddenly start going even built one across street though. Given .27% New York City already died COVID, really hard time finding estimate reflective reality. think 101% New Yorkers contracted virus already.

NYC 22,700 deaths among population 8,400,000. both. Deaths undercounted factor 3 5 places. Cases undercounted perhaps much order magnitude.

What's fun catch multiple times, roll dice time. counting someone infected twice two cases? they?

For reasons more, Covid's case fatality rate fairly hard pin down. numbers involved putting together flawed serious ways. 
It's better nothing, assume final number said done. Lol told people can't think Parrott ""fake news""

According *The Atlantic* COVID Tracking Project (source below) 251,499 COVID hospitalizations date. consistent University Minnesota COVID Hospitalization Tracking Project (source below) states 256,807 hospitalizations date. use higher number. 

256,807 hospitalizations / 30,500,000 cases = 0.84% infected people needing hospitalization. So, would imply 99.16% COVID infections mild.

This might seem like strange comparison I've found thinking people prisons say getting caught selling marijuana ppl spend years trapped cells 23 hours day ppl adapt radical life change. told hey go keep essentials wear mask people can't even regardless fact life others may line.

The fact friend can't fall dispare. definitely people right things seems like majority stories get media attention. allow start hate fellow human selfish actions become hate. know correct decision, wanted Turner call bluff see they'd actually go it. Now, repubs blame dem mayor infringing upon freedums. data showing didn’t cause spike cases. It’s surprising, know, reasons this:

1. FAR protestors Trump rally attendees wore masks

2. protests outdoors

3. Protesters often moved around march helps keep people prolonged close contact seen School isn’t list. sure would rank going school activity. saying numbers support statement, checked, mean masks work. jump airplane holding umbrella stop falling, employ several different methods slowing descent might work.

...Please poke holes analogy, they're strong suit, know mean. Masks never *the* solution, one tool among many.

That said, wonder masks generate false feeling safety. Masks *something*, must 1000x less effective social distancing (although I'm expert). people start wearing masks, also go outside more, really meaningless. feel like we're caught convincing people bare minimum forget bare minimum, solve problems.  fact denying ""Everyone get us!"" right wing, basement dwelling nutter cult ;) Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahha Oh, love it.

Well first time I've ever agreed Duterte. messed response lunatic dictator like ""I'm crazy enough follow footsteps""  comment needs higher management years never seen people act like this. worst Black Friday.

Even get metronome, play perfectly everyone else... going sound synced right then. 
massGraves.jpg Got sources that? ducked up. literally downside wearing mask. Early tests scarce, tested people already hospital symptoms. testing expanded, people get tested much early on, week two many end hospital, another week two die, (I presume) there's delay reporting death official statistics.

Also, hospitals get overwhelmed start deciding intubate let die (like happened Italy), death rates suddenly climb significantly. Unless you’re Quebec apparently Wrong. 5% decimal little bud. deadly people comorbities also effecting perfectly healthy young people too. false equivalence try compare flu. lot teachers high school retirement age enjoyed work. talking family it. think pandemic really tough people like usually tech savvy. like actually teach, person, classroom. reason? Sounds like jealous isn’t convenient really state prepared deal pandemic terms equipment &amp; personnel. fact California got rid pandemic ""war chest"" amassed Governator successor thought waste money PPE sitting idle century event. States needed close &amp; lockdown buy time hospitals get PPE, expand ICU beds &amp; train nurses deal covid patients. Remember, virus grows exponentially. manageable outbreak one week NYC triage-level next. healthcare system able handle multiple NYC-level outbreaks going simultaneously around country. I’m waiting spin doctors downplay gotta pump numbers 

Those rookie numbers though? Sweden much infection Nordic countries early on. see compare March statistics. Nordic countries implemented restrictions around 12th March, meaning would take around 3 weeks affect death rate. period Norway 20 deaths, Denmark 80 Sweden around 400. That's restrictions effect countries. three weeks see countries, yes including Sweden, growth rate decelerates. Sweden problem early hit countries, unlike neighbours.

Reopening without plan appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* You’re right manipulation bad information there. critical thinking make good decisions. Masks obviously good. Anyone lick sense known day one. *How good* debate. 

Social distancing obviously good. Viruses don’t cause pandemics, people do. 

So long follow common sense protocols regarding distancing masks, protocols accepted standard entire world over, you’re better most. 

How many people sick dying exactly? Exact doesn’t matter. answer lot, it’s contagious. It’s ok water muddy long try keep people moving right direction. Yeah, I've looking death rate. Couple things wonder, good Florida's death numbers? could quite bit (under reported). Also, even 15% infected, we're still looking around \~75% still get full open herd immunity achieved. still means another 5X deaths, probably current infections run course. remember initial numbers state coming out, personally comparing developed countries appropriate response. Either dying significantly higher rate, almost 3 times anywhere else, simply many people didnt care. Like, third caseload. airborne long wind air circulation going vital know. IMO. though dosage virus stays air may low actual infection.

it seems main cause infection close contact someone infected longer period time. meaning bigger droplets likley catch it.
so afraid carry facemask. reduce chances further. airborne small droplets may get though infection risk way lower Nah okay, virus disappear summer sun. hand, Arizona exactly known dry, sunny summer weather. Source? expected.

r/coronavirus: “Trust scientists, CDC, Fauci. you’re things stfu.”

Me: *cites CDC WebMD*

And wonder people starting disbelieve narrative. newest retort / talking point. lackadaisical approach sheer ignorance around magnitude what’s happening stunning. don’t scientist doctor understand.
  
Also, nation’s biggest influencer, words create much damage taken statements truth ... salesman painting pretty picture someone buy. Cruises mostly lower classes, working finns Finnish speaking majority seem get angry among swedes. Much seems resentment forced learn Swedish school.

It's always case, seems become little bit worse since nationalist party got bigger. like Swedish speaking minority. Last spring sudden move online learning, school’s choral classes big research project protest music throughout history. cool. Hopefully chorus band able come back spring right make things work. Awesome Great, could get repeat lead paint/leased gas era. guess people missed old crime rates. said believe want instead giving source ? saying lying simply backup saying since online least search @assclown3 others said, ask wear mask health also stay different room possible. Make sure also wipe area works afterwards also anything else may touch door handles. want point like church things poorly.

For long time limited person attendance we’re streaming services.

Now mask requirements attempting socially isolate much possible worshiping person, realization things begin spike area go back streaming online full-time time being. backlog worldometer talked last days following 4th July? seems odd random 1 day spike like this. actual temperature effect it. affect long survives surfaces air. dont think effect potency way, higher temps make less contagious factors highlighted makes sense goes away summer. Study done Bangladesh... God preventing spread. rate way US reduce number record cases everyone infected it.

But seriously though, sad seeing record broken almost everyday. there’s still people refuse follow regulations despite these, convenience. Karen Facebook told drive past hospital parking lot, many cars. Trump needs tell people stop counting deaths. numbers high. YOLO crowd might want start getting ready. Yea course Thank wonderful perspective, follow suggestion  cannot open schools back full capacity fall. COVID going explode that. president pushing hard this, even tweeting morning may cut funding schools comply. 

This asking teachers potentially catch pandemic placing students danger. Lots educators need speak gotta refuse go back face-to-face. Fuck noise. 

Putting kids confined spaces spread COVID families unacceptable. Trump wants everything open things get really bad shut month two Sept-October everyone sensible (Democrat’s) scared leave house vote vs Republicans don’t give shit. 60% deaths men age 60. Literally killing base get win.... Eh, hockey will. Seems like NHL NHLPA came solid plan put two hub cities Canada instead United States. Plus players live Canada already. Testing every two days.

Baseball, can’t see happening restart bungled poor testing procedures. travel. Lots moving parts. Sucks too, baseball alright Taiwan South Korea.

Basketball hottest hot spot United States. It’s gonna hard keep players bubble. bad also couldn’t chosen Canada.... don’t think Canadian government would alright letting thousands Americans in.

Football one troubles seeing field. arrogance NFL see try, though. college football. mean... now? country protest use force last several weeks? Ok, NY make distinction indoors outdoors, NJ did. Got now. Article title misses important ""when social distancing isn’t possible"" part, surface looked masks always required. updates, new perspective. think need reread.  Sadly, no. heavenly bound, they’re earthly good. Well soon enough extra testing capacity places, number new cases stabalize! /s ""accidentallly"" Good detective work! Yeah, point onwards, daily recoveries lower since fewer cases. since takes one confirmed ""recovered"", take time reach end. hope day get new cases anymore come soon. Study done Bangladesh - small study - much data provided associated paper linked. Would rather see studies japan jumping train.... sociopath? were, would even know it? Interesting questions.... Protests, schools... virus discriminate there's awful lot poverty US

And India doesn't?

I live India, ghetto poor people right next building, live one developed cities India yes, lot great beautiful sites, also lot poverty. Keep mind, lot cases India came poor migrant workers returning villages hometowns.

 US cases due people move another state? (not stupid ones, that's cheating) People stupid everywhere, fact, share - guy would kiss covid patients family pulled plug family member put air conditioner

I’m worried happens younger people infect grandparents start seeing waves aren’t heavily young people. correct, work long run die hard conservatives get sick it.

But GOP long term strategy, GOP's siege mentality politics embraced post-Tea Party era. GOP wants white conservatives seen opressed minority danger, turn white vote block vote like minorities. That's go way pick fights anyone conservative. Holy shit husband full-time, professional, church music director, confirm pressure go person worship high, pastors/ministers/priests often either ill-equipped unwilling push back important congregants/parishioners. couple thousand-year-old books written pretty unenlightened humans scientifically speaking. always forget that, religious texts written fallible human beings struggling understand world around context times lived. mandate doesn’t even authority county decisions either bullshit happened shutdowns.

Oh, ok! Except nationwide protests 10,000x bigger church service, okay know joke comment viruses usually mutate become less deadly. Killing host useful virus. tried sign testing openings next month unless doctor referral, kind crazy...I live one least populated states nation too. Yup already see “but one 45 dies 0% chance” like would go family lost child tell child 0% deaths count. It’s bad boy. arrogance continues. Looking post history clarifies things bit. good one bud. even read articles? doctor concerned renewed surge hospital utlization increasing caseload mixing corona paitents uninfected paitents. Also, pandemic caused depression census first place less caseload people feel safer, causing chaos return.

Thank seeing home, though. left work first week March, never imagined would go long, us stick long haul, make huge difference getting this. update mentioned article. actually post update situation month half later mistake. article talks general problem people going A&amp;E seeking help non-emergency issues instead first contacting nurse husläkare... even anything Coronavirus, problem long time. seen people going A&amp;E literal coughs long Corona, wa sthe Germany. Depending region. Northeast sees surge again, would distinct, measurable second wave, especially NYC.

The US extremely large country physically speaking, regions actually best way break down.

Saying US still 1st wave equivalent saying Europe 1st wave couple countries never stopped surging. (Granted, much larger percentage US still 1st wave) Shhhhh hush now. *touches face sexuality* school strike, I'd say that's better option. I've heard states allow teachers strike, tho can't see could enforce that.

And least strike car picket line outside school, wear masks. strike protest safer opening schools least. Honestly school go strike right SHOULD. stating lot things without sources here. Would love see harder arrest heavily armed people.

Some people arm heavily exactly reason. It’s politics liberty self reliance writ large.  

I don’t think there’s particular malice it, it’s part believe, isn’t ? Allen Carr also lifelong smoker since childhood. You’re right don’t understand certainly did. It’s book. don’t think that’s true anymore. Deaths pointing reality. However believe hit somewhere 5-20% infected it’s over. literally can't make stuff up. two weeks still dont result, want come back work anyway! :\ Short term pain, long term gain. European Asian countries locked hard actually getting back work. “protect economy costs” attitude kept us locking soon enough first time, result cost us long term. Kids disease vectors. don’t wipe hands, touch shit, bring disease homes families. 

Also educators usually middle age folks, meaning face-to-face puts danger too. certainly get way drunk - bars can't pay bills drinking home.

But United States social safety net saw lockdowns breaking quickly. States pressuring reopen social safety net politicians rather risk lives create one. truly want understand opponent’s vision here:

1) travel risk, school eliminates need travel, student go home work there.

2) “Black Lives Matter”, seats vacated foreigners open spots colleges Americans - significant portion black.

3) Specific state/public schools, using tax dollars, benefiting local citizens, selling seats highest bidder.

In short, don’t need here, aren’t supposed here, go home. 10%+ unemployment historic pandemic hands.

Would one less left.  many people suck. Yeah, there's global recession make sense say country 'failed' recession bad neighboring countries. competitive global economy. outrun bear. 

And make sense say country 'failed' higher (initial) death rate countries. known consequence, Sweden's health care system overburdened there's reason think (final) death rate higher would tighter restrictions. Meanwhile USA many hospitals reporting already capacity (no vacant beds) also short nursing staff. 

When look data year now, likely Sweden overall death rate lower USA (due better healthcare system), also less financial impact. 

Sweden failed vaccine cure developed soon, Sweden's deaths could avoided implemented restrictions. happen. Therefore, Sweden fail. time vaccine reaches phase 3, think assume side effects minimal. aren’t going administer 10 000 people could kill lol.

And considering badly pandemic affected life, willing take risk get back normal. many people suck. probably arent old enough noticeable. Christians like people give religion serious side eye.

Nice discussion culture ... pandemic affecting cruise lines major theme serious coronavirus sub since end January Diamond Princess came light. Since then, much discussion cruise industry generally affected coronavirus discussed. one point common probably could flair. simply another installment theme, one Sweden's largest newspapers. many want censor silence news relating Sweden abuse report button try achieve goal. unfortunate sometimes succeed. I've got mine chest holster occasion! Experts saying cloth masks filters good layers. He’s begging administration something act 3 months. pleas landed deaf ears. must exhausting Dr. Fauci, knowing must done watching willfully ignored. Universities opening going next matchstick. That's hate churches. prone groupthink money chasing. next thing know they'll twist scripture way say ""God want us fear viruses"" crazy crap. 

God also want donate even money usual help cope virus though, funnily enough. bring interesting real point. work urgent care see fair number workers compensation patients - people injured work (and usual cadre sick people). number patients need ""another work note job"" trivial number. rich people. definition working poor. medicaid. sad thing job got injured follow work restrictions, second jobs don't, often second jobs labor intensive fashion construction, maintenance, landscaping, janitorial. 

So happens jobs? Well, job honor restrictions patient 4 options:

A) Quit (not likely, they're working 2 jobs reason)
B) work full duty risk getting injured (risky - 1st companies insurance deny claim treatments)
C) attempt follow restrictions put place even though company already said ""too bad"", risk getting fired
D) Stay home get paid (or use PTO ran out, any, again, risk getting fired staying home. 

It's never good situation. I’m still personally concerned myself. know 2 people age said like cold. happening them! quite lol..honestly cant believe rally guess literally product shit interest rates 38-42% today, depending preferred poll USA needs. stupid wear masks socially distance get virus effects brains.

That's absolutely concern. me, states like AZ FL getting ICU capacity week two, means people dying instead getting treatment. top that, know long term impact. treat binary 'you died recovered' reality - getting disease awful itself. Partner's coworker lost 40 lbs, ICU 5 days, took month recover. He's 40 unhealthy. stats would say ""next!"" certain VAST majority Christians think Sabbath Sunday. Catholics might think otherwise

The history shows started changing 17th century largely antisemitism really understand makes confident rising case numbers big deal, especially acknowledge long term effects well understood.

It true long term effects well understood. (a) use observed far estimate effects are, (b) take severe cases treat norm? 

Yes, people recovered covid long-term lung damage, brain damage, amputations, on. assume majority survivors face? course not, science support assertion. also people recover fine. one common case? flame throwers, gas prices down. Yes, good stop it. related coronavirus pandemic since stopped directly that. piece news relating pandemic, posted it. almost like system benefits treating us like complete shit 30 seconds, understand right. took Wuhan 20 days running ICU beds full lockdown Simony? like people trying sell positions religious authority miracles or--[oh darn Companies stepping carrying quasi-governmental duties state rotten husk. guy active World Warcraft Dating 30 subs. pillow fort pre-pandemic dreams excuse socially acceptable. especially considering religion major proponent funder science (or ""natural philosophy"") centuries viewed understanding God's work venerating him. early 20th century fundamentalist movements turned back clock science knowledge. Hell Vatican still observatory!

This exactly true. backed research far contradict teachings. Let's remember Catholic Church kept Galileo house arrest findings, specifically Earth revolved around Sun way around. 

Likewise, 50's Church specifically stated theory evolution contradict Church teachings, still maintain position followers need accept evolution. 50's, specifically made statements; outright ignored Darwin's ""Origin Species"". Believing evolution definitely faux-pas Catholic Church.

And that's Catholic Church. church takes Bible literally going major issues almost science since geology, paleontology, astronomy, biology...they contradict Bible. pepsi challenge see god exists praying virus away.

[Disclaimer Good!  screaming “freedom” stupid shit.

If everyone wore masks risk getting Coronavirus goes down, dramatically increases freedom. guys see ""freedom"" absolute value rather trade-off never think long term. point freedom spend weeks ICU, die, become seriously ill long term lung damage? Second, treat freedom absolute value thus anything decreases freedom bad. they're acting live society. kind absolute freedom think exist. People gave enter society engage social contract one another. exchange potential freedom society, got benefits society. likely based news even asymptomatic people permanent scarring lung tissues, would complicate lung issues get elder years. instead living 80, may get 65 later life health problems age. assumption hopefully I'm wrong. think it’s mindset. I’m part Ca 90% shoppers wear mask. It’s 100% stores Security front would turn away dontt mask. It’s common thing. People turn around go get mask car. course, tithes must flow... You’re dumbest mother fuckers planet. What's status dexamethasone? news quite nothing heard So, going close things, reopen, close again, rinse, repeat, thing gone? supports place.

They’re wound back rest country, since case numbers low...but sudden local spike, plan adjusted particular. That’s they’re working - support people single city lockdown, everyone else continues opening back up.

Excuse cultural ignorance matter, honest question. know move reservations I've met work field though never thought ask them. work families homes this, scares most. want make sure small families work quarantining have, day one family mentioned going church weekend celebrate bunch elderly couples anniversaries. Even safety measures I'm house 15 hours week going church, matter time catch too. China slow disclose information outbreak, actively tried downplay significance outbreak, refused actually anything close wet markets. They've done plenty earn criticism outbreak.

Never realized racist town moved across country didn’t hear white kids saying n word hard R every day. would read entire story know that. flu bro! Basically. Anytime try tell follow safe practices like taking 80yr old grandma lunch tells stop treating like child...yet makes poor decisions. Idk do, haven’t seen since March I’m cautious thinks I’m overreacting. live AZ btw Sure, COVID currently one spreading throughout country don’t yet vaccine it. 

And it’s making folks sick. 

This normal. None is. Move word 'should' forward couple spaces. Hey, POTS years, it’s improved greatly though still take beta blocker daily. didn’t already know r/POTS subreddit wild. Par course. Many meatpacking workers minorities, low income. know administration feels minorities, poor.

This expected. all, rip children mothers stick em cages border. America. Church city proud defy Newsom's order. wearing masks lowering capacity all. Oh main pastor big correspondence One America News. dandy! Paul create Sabbath verse referring Sabbath. It’s baby’s time job properly parent. It’s like watching infant around pool. it’s time it’s cool neglectful?? People stupid. “The leprous person disease shall wear torn clothes let hair head hang loose, shall cover upper lip[a] cry out, ‘Unclean, unclean.’ people Israel would see face Moses, skin Moses' face shining. Moses would put veil face again, went speak him.

There also several sexist passages tell women hide faces. absolutely sexist also raises percentage individuals protected infectious diseases 50%. would significantly reduce infection rates societies standard. Ok yeah I’ll go get right that. (New Zealander here) Well, completely get rid general population.

Now cases people returning infected countries, everyone comes back NZ goes straight quarantine. people social distance even wear masks anymore here. soul saved cheeses. generally true statement lot exceptions. every virus even mutates much - one, instance, particularly less likely mutate influenza viruses. ask virologist details understanding genome essentially less modular viruses, can't swap genes like puzzle piece. 

*Generally* virus absolutely vicious, takes spreading quickly mild. Ebola people dying home within days catching it, see strain milder would advantage spreading people. One great counter-example 1918 flu: soldiers sickest brought back front, essentially encouraged worse mutations.

It's absolutely universally true, overall trend simply deadly *tends to* hurt spread. Lol fuck mean *your interpretation* Bible.

For majority Christians world, Catholic Orthodox, it’s fellowship. real physical material component. 

Only Protestants could essentially lose nothing Zoom.

Now that’s say can’t put pause while- Orthodox Church has. gov’t doesn’t care. want bare minimum get payday Trump loses.

The president sort dementia. He’s strung along last minute. doubt factors important; trying point population distribution/demographics/dynamics country different, can't compare easily. power sit ass home though. understand never clear chicken pox virus, causes complications later life?

do understand that? shames see churches epicenter ignorance stupidity. actually followed teachings Jesus, world would much better place. Instead, lot churches seem themselves. need rest Georgia get board. Savannah, Athens, East Point created mask mandates since Kemp refusing. like curfews beginning pandemic. Kemp refused take action individual cities counties finally made statewide. new strategy ""Safety Promise"" campaign. sure he's going realize people state wear mask unless forced to. ""rights"" /eyeroll got another thing\* coming

\*think

The ""another think"" related previous ""think"", ""think again"".

There ""thing"". can't *another* thing without previous thing.

Think it. 5G conspiracy get Obama back office

Sign fuck buy kn95 masks? Yeah. it’s also law businesses require customers wear masks, restricted bars’ restaurants’ operations.

The states people get stink-eye wearing mask (or laughable) regulations place. Look Texas’ numbers governor openly stated elderly people basically okay sacrificing lives keep economy going. skyrocketing. counties wanted place mask orders governor literally said couldn’t.

My point *need* regulations. cannot trust people “personal accountability” especially risk people’s lives. It’s weird evangelicals don’t view biblical plague avoid it. Surely depends it. 

If assemble people slaughter them, sure, freedom assembly covered. anything? No. still need follow laws.

Same thing religion. limits beliefs be. Jonestown-type religious activity covered first amendment? No, isn’t. allowed assemble religion, allowed lead people deadly things. Well outdoors WITHOUT masks, doesn’t much good.

If trouble here, biggest key whether people wearing masks. sounds mean virus Hitler tried - get rid old, weak crazy. smart strong survive. want start conspiracy theory seems engineered. I'm happy graduated high school year, cant imagine last semester entire year. pastor Christian, he’s politician. I’m sorry loss. similar feelings knowing it’s family history. followed cardiologist make sure you’re risk? sounds like I’m going seeing one regularly caution. put name lol Next ""why people think others turning fascists"".

Like, disagree many/most people taking seriously seem political affiliation, questions like essentially moving ""thought crime"" territory.

Besides, know plenty people camps taking seriously, others aren't. Best stick fundamentals - *done* recently. don’t think feds control individual states decide schools opening not.  ""The normal virus"". millions viruses. dangerous vaccine anti-virals yet. Without common flu would killing many people. Someone certainly wanted eat dead pangolin bat something make dick hard weeks reopening restaurants, malls beaches, Israel seeing 50-fold surge new coronavirus cases. approximately 20 new cases day mid-May 1,000 new cases day less two months later, Israel rushing close venues recently rushed open.

It seems like rapidly reopening leads people become complacent shit Bold assume anyone wants go Manitoba. went Back Bay Boston first time since corona. 100% mask wearing. one person without one, including utility workers, shoppers, cops, etc. 

MA lowest rate transmission nation. Widely available testing &lt;2% positive. 6.7 million population daily deaths bounced around 0-20ish. attended church 400+ twice week. two cases confirmed covid 19 March. quarantined spouses contract according tests. We’ve met weekly since May single person conducted covid 19. someone sick stay home. don’t social distance wear masks. It’s pretty awesome you’re removing attack too. instigate something walk free start this? don’t know Floridas hospitalization numbers.... But..but..Jeezus!!! vote L town Cheers mate. new spike cases started riots/lootings though family state I’m anti-mask. One taken several trips Fl. son’s first birthday coming up. Guess isn’t invited? I’m risking baby like that. This. North America, every modern structure uses kind ventilation applied too. Yep. probably experiencing boon right now, especially egregious grifters like Jim Bakker. church online outdoor, distanced meetings. it’s hot people, watch indoors wear masks distance themselves. know much Jews Torah, I'm curious. do, others didn't, plague? love trolls don’t even attempt troll anymore dumb talking points proven wrong again, again, again. 

But I’m sure show soon enough try convince us deaths good thing. worrying. Looks ever likely we’re going see worst recession centuries. 4/5 months still clear plans support lockdown. need series society reform ""Drive minute clinic."" Dear leader tweeted today withhold funding state open full time. cross posted /r/NoShitSherlock subreddit?

I checked, median teacher age US slightly 42 years.

I spent several years K-12 schools university. many us well 40, preexisting conditions, like high blood pressure, we're obese.

Maybe national coordinated push tho. would anyone attack Chinese Americans either? Hate, self loathing, anger often gets directed towards whoever think abuse friends accept it. I'm sorry go this. people dumb losing much money lack elective surgeries might incentive try earn money back whatever ways can. *His* school stayed open longer. article mis titled. protest belief president opened quickly allowing everything back fully, could show beat virus use help win election... see surge cases new lockdowns. multiple PhD epis working team. primary leads. 

I think it’s issue lot cases illegal immigrants blindness American hegemony last 40 years playing comment. assume support decline American hard soft power, rescinding international influence? words:

Pretty unlikely, statisically chance getting infected form seconds hugging low, statically speaking infected shown symptoms now, unless asymptomatic infection case. would say continue follow routine precautions worry much it. site seems pretty accurate: love god people, learn enjoy smoking weed chill home, tried true decades, *gasp* fun You’re clearly confused definition willingness interact. pretty sure hes split non trump vote, making possible trump win really. end May looked like Texas far excess mortality numbers.

Cuomo intimidate anyone, police standing rioters &amp; looters should. Well least get free cats. LIBERATE AUSTIN!!!  /s Except parents want it. read (ie glanced headline) pediatrics report kids back school full time. understand kids low risk. give single shit adults building. kids go back, wear masks, teachers get sick. 

I teach high school. district's current plan teaching 4 classes, halved, week. I'll also need provide online content they're (4 5 days). We're also shoving annual classes one semester. 

In words, need least twice much half time subjected 144 kids/week 2.5 hours each, know fact taking precautions. also *might* teach students who's parents want 100% online (even though kids face face 100% time limited morning prep I'm supposed plan, create grade least 144 kids). I'm also supposed communicate (and document!) contact every kid every day. covid get me, assume exhaustion will. 

If get sick, need quarantine student gets sick, use sick personal time. process could least 2 weeks every positive test... NYC bad population density seen anywhere else, Cuomo's handling nursing homes (remember 40% deaths nursing homes), doctors know much treating virus overintubated people. seen anywhere else going forward (including laissez-faire Sweden).

Your odds dying get virus 50 roughly 3 10,000. much likely die car accident. around charts, number tests there. Obviously bad news. particular calculation, [LINK daily changes. tracks test administered date rather test analyzed date. go analyzed date, mercy many tests labs run particular day. That's seen wild fluctuations reported daily cases. find daily cases state wonderful solution. Though sincerely hope isolating testing violators sending volunteer hospitals. 

A state country last elected president promise he’d hook flush toilet every house currently handling pandemic finesse “best country world”. Soon deadest country.  work well prior WW1 changed? Ooh Green Grotto. I’m Bubble Republic girl haha Type everything backwards hold mirror?

Umm think missing United part. federal government help state governments. nothing them, fact, making harder..like dictator think big mistake US unilaterally leave organization.

There obvious issues within positive results could achieved forming coalitions working change. absolutely correct. Based symptoms experienced, especially neurologically afterwards— believe Covid-19 January. Although, cannot prove this. I’m trying take precautionary measures protect everyone around me. I’ll keep wearing mask. Hot summers make indoor activities get people believe stupid conspiracy theories? muh rights people? take? fuck virus become political? Yup, thing. one hand centuries white supremacy, racial violence, systemic racism running economic governmental institutions.

On other, oppression public health protection rights minor inconvenience.

Shut fuck Anyone know accuracy rate full “up nose” tests vs halfway swabs? interesting game guess ever! Yeh. comment mine inspired 🤣 horror see going happen America 2 weeks now, finally numbers deaths infected reported. people understand death reports lagged, think America fast approaching point return regards controlling COVID. May God Bless us world. Same. 

I enjoyed spending weekends family also staying in. Delivery services worth $5-$10 bucks get want without dealing public. 

Don’t forget airfare credits. Set reminder phone 3 months remind them. another 90 days out. study determine that, speculate increased risk may due decreased stomach acid - think probably comes back fairly quickly. really know association, think anyone say sure. reasonable evidence covid worse people smoke significant reduction becoming infected.

While smoker obviously best could terrible time stop. Yeah, like can’t even make app like developed country there? north gets austin, pdx, chicago, california. write “what covid generation” fact see outcome would worse. It’s not. doubts intentions honesty pm work out. Guess they're trying clear state floods global warming. either CoVid-19 bad even extreme measures like ventilator kills (my father mother's case) equivalent average flu long term side effects.

No, that's definitely *not* exhausting possibilities. extremely simplistic view, wrong, based simply knowing people who've COVID bad enough persistently impaired, bad enough admitted hospital. want defund police. literally refuse job. really want read AMA someone working mass production vaccines, important things right realize least *few* Covid skeptics highly educated intelligent people experts relevant fields, right? one first states fully reopen. Full capacity bars/restaraunts looking like major way spread. Churches too. death rate goes nothing age. Keep eye numbers, deaths lag infections 2-3 weeks. lol, talking wrong tweets, one beat great POTUS. least, would change mind correct tweets, orange guy even bother. grew Dallas never direct path tornado, several hit way close comfort. nightmares tornadoes time.

This still win even virus 100% prevented prevent main cause death understand I'm sorry. I'm glad eating read comment would spit dog. According the state health department record increase “is partially due delays receiving data reports labs volume cases holiday weekend.” saving nobody got sick blm protests.

Well want get *pedantic*, didnt say either.

I said ""the protests didnt cause spread"". in, ""didnt spread virus appreciable degree"". ""Didnt spread virus around"".

If think that's different enough ""no evidence urban protests reignited Covid-19 case growth"" warrant comment, dont know say.  ultimate Douche move pandemic. Bravo, well done. Probably fine people symptomatic?

That's say companies list there. ""director customer service"" insurance company. Another perfect 'leadership' example. soon enough Fauci saying month ago many states decided completely give containing virus. I’ll take infectious disease information top infectious disease expert nation, Dr. Fauci: 


“...it's false narrative take comfort lower rate death"" coronavirus U.S., warning: ""There’s many things dangerous bad virus. Don’t get false complacency."" -Dr. Fauci

Do realize lower mortality rate partly due available hospital beds, hospital beds filling up? obviously spreading... Look basically metric mods were(are?) same, switched modding styles. produce evidence massive campaign blackmail bribery chinese americans western europeans make 99% someone say supposed slow got warm? I'm picturing video little girl licking railing ride queue. Barf. holiday? one September? Cause doubt Florida even make past month. Yep, that's thought.

You refuse accept something took 5 seconds check, we're done. fun, safe, please reproduce! Got it. definitely think two years post-grad medicine (hell medicine) make decision making research better this. wouldn’t personally expect someone less educated. don’t know requirements states, reply made sound like state’s CNAs, certificate program. I’d actually still expect make informed science based public health decisions average person. Nah, despise enough care downvote. oranges can't even reason. Mom told brother come Nova Scotia - expected stay wasnt that. friends told family come well  almost nothing difference cases, man. (Canada) amazing leadership new cases deaths trickle US explodes control (like 500x many new cases day...)

Most deaths come huge outbreaks old age care facilities Quebec, skewed numbers quite bit.  scream “Scientists dumb they’re liberal. Trump right he’s white republican.

But yeah, okay, guess may come around 2% current case counts. rather, case counts two weeks ago. give US one these... Bruh report job fuck. job know shit??? She’s putting lives risk. getting information?? really, really factual. 

 

 Thanks good news /s

History repeats itself. We’ve we’re repeating again. 🤦‍♂️ Self-centeredness eradicated possessing advanced degree. really first world country? Look rank [paid maternity many Americans falling victim virus paid sick leave?

Pathetic. illusion first-worldness totally nulled voided stamped sealed arrival pandemic. first world dangerously edge cliff, next stop reality second-world status. wonder makes worse don’t follow advice. Danish authorities seem reading guidelines protect yourself. seems didn’t advise general public use them. lot advice practical charities world navigate every day, even is, people going take time educate comply.

Also, control studies basing decisions clinical settings. Data real world public use Covid situations comparative studies many confounding factors.

I would rather take successful Country’s advice matter honest. many countries successful us lower mask usage.

Surely foolproof shield better idea. what's American interest???? see that's problem I’m surprised percentage low. 2020 shitty year really find hard believe earn moniker. 1918 way worse year. lot, Iran gone 0 death regions 138 death increasing daily, crippling effect already disastrous economy, good, trust much trust vox salon. pretty much experienced every covid symptom. I’m comfortable saying likely it. Don’t waste time antibody year (unless you’re interested don’t care accuracy) get organs (lungs, kidnies, etc) checked long term damage near future (although maybe wait pandemic still roaring) lot Redditors still remember era ""zero tolerance"" schools. I'll tell right - exist anymore. We're era ""zero consequence."" Teachers struggle constantly classroom management there's backup. Administrators refuse discipline students, even though job. Without consequences, student behavior devolves year. Schools rated partially discipline numbers, administrators deal it. pretend problems there. Meanwhile well-behaved students education constantly interrupted teachers leave profession droves stressful teaching is. 

States districts requiring students wear masks want deal students families refuse. like always, teachers ones face consequences decisions. controlled China wtf. There's proof Keanu: “Am joke you?” Ugh, I'm sorry say probably point. Nothing shock anymore. lmao people going disney world weekend really can't make case influenced Chinese money America supplying order magnitude cash. Especially demonstrated coercion work countries willing contribute cause. 

It's embarrassing. wait 20-29 age group seeing getting infected go see parents, grandparents. Oh wait. already happened 4th. Crap. going gradually get worse think. Hope I'm wrong. Go side roof peak. sides homes wood vinyl. foam.

Better drowning. FL first positive counts cases, subsequent positives affect positive tests total test positivity rate, separate categories cases. What?!?! Realistically it'll get vaccine. 

Looking purely perspective helpful could be, long term mask wearing would reduce spread possibly disease prevent thousands deaths year. 

Hand washing would impact, although one 0% chance happening. Forcing people wear masks *could* happen, think will/should. benefits palpable although probably worth it. 

It realistic, that's fine. person personally care wearing mask, easy see benefits. answer “Yes, whole country stay home year (at least) due selfish shits like yourself. fucks can’t trusted minimal shit keep rest country safe.” 

Sorry, it’s trying day patience people like right now. Oh joy. bet doom gloomers we’re happy hear this. You’ve wanted say right. Well you’re right. We’re screwed. hope you’re fucking happy. church needs shut fuck down. Yeah, today looking good narrative. Lets see tomorrow goes. want get ahead ourselves. claim deaths rising quickly, dip back ammunition use us. Let dig low death grave. fails continue trend down. graph rough estimate hospitalization rates? Probably best indicator see testing spreading That's exactly did. created both. Science explained things could understand, Column A.. Religions explained understand, Column B.

Over time, countless things Column B moved Column A, never gone way. I’m guessing going liege. Trust me, don’t want lice. 😜 lot complete idiots. go work, don’t read news, drink play video games.. it’s super easy miss headlines. Never underestimate stupid people. Probably born poor, it’s incredibly difficult escape poverty. I’ve never known poverty, follow someone explains challenges poverty, mental drain tracking every last penny spend. (I read somebody surveyed people exiting store asked shoppers total cost contents shopping bags. poor people could tell penny, middle/upper classes clue. trade effectiveness safety time. 

Let us say vaccine developed monitored decade, 1 10 million people sick fatal side effect vaccine. one year vaccine 1 1 million.

You cannot say one year vaccine dangerous, less safe. extreme situation now, still good solution. outdoors exercising. exception Texas mask rule particular activity. Positivity rate concerning. Imagine Newsom hadn’t slapped Disney’s plan reopen Disneyland.....yeesh.

So many people can’t seem grasp concept exponential growth early stages look like plateau. time start see growth, it’s far far faaaaar late Man knew deaths coming really hoping something “it’s young people getting infected” talk. Oof overt still hardly rises daily noise thousands dying every day something administration basically nothing. Smh. discouraging. 975 now, looking likely today would least broken even increased slightly holiday interference. thing is, none takes away embarrassingly bad US handling this. Hey, someone Quebec, agree! Less movement best keeping cases down. I'm part taking previously planned trip east year :) Oh hey, got bud!

Go get run like Seattle chick black man highway. oh. thought Black Lives Matter. Stupid ligger. new term white leftists. Yep, trust numbers coming US. pretty sad Arizona soon total cases Massachusetts. Relatively similar populations, Arizona much less population density, major international airport Europeans flooded country early crisis. Oh, hot temps supposed limit transmission. Well, guys bigger population we're much testing. So, know, think governments fucked us over. really depends whether workforce infected sick. Lombardy Veneto disasters came flooding patients ER infecting nurses doctors knew SARS Cov 2 landed Europe. hospitals operate iCUs beds full capacity 30 even 40 % workforce less. even saw retired nurses , veterinarian doctors, med school students, triage ER Bergamo keep enough ICU trained professional Covid beds. count hit 1k, obvious lost fight virus. Why? many people many states take seriously enough. virus mainly confined west coast northeast making real progress. soon got states full force game over. Sad countries decent economies healthcare systems far better situations now. would coronavirus parties Lifelong condition :( Sure, discrimination tall people? joke probably okay make either. Yes, harmless joke, racism Asians gets normalized. Bye bye Florida didn’t way.

Remember that. y’all leave voicemails? I’m sure greedy shams still keep tuition same. nothing different Harvard online college like University Phoenix. Let's play danger game airborne virus asymptomatic carriers: indoors re-breathing exhalations hundreds people none wear mask... 

... hmmmm.... 

Three guesses first two count. confirm Garcetti, Newsome, somebody, reimpose fucking lockdown! totally control! hell waiting for? doctor triage tent even ask people insurance?

Wait..  60% Maryland's COVID-19 deaths linked long-term care facilities. News4 I-Team found many deaths vanished state's website, making look like far fewer homes serious unacceptable,"" said Leni Preston, health consumer advocate. ""If going make informed decision, want somebody else deciding information need. want information."" Oof. thousand month. big spike. Hopefully off. Doubt though unfortunately. source this? would love share others. forget travel Florida Texas states. 

Many people Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana travel Florida beaches. spikes states around two hotspots.

Stay south can. We're essentially 1% infected, exponential growth trends could soon 10% (32.8m). 

Scary. Tell boss lead us - moment creating chaos division allowing science professionals set guidance.
What joke - know poorly doing. try reading. commented post says 30% population 30% hospital beds. gonna pay bills? we’ve virus hotbed primary exporter months now, proper response finger pointing origin?

We’re gonna put fire out, billy started it!

But billy going put fire approaching house?

No! billy started it!

So going put fire?

No! Billy asshole! seeing flying legally. suspend someone liberty Judge order needed issue TX. aren’t providing students. teachers school nurse paraprofessionals, that.
So it’s cost issue here. Slow reporting holiday not, outside *upper bound* \~ 50%, generally high verification (tends right) model adjusts weekend effects. could distribute back 100 deaths Sunday Monday usual weekend effect would *still* upper range. Fuck that. scummy society accept 40,000 deaths year get somewhere slightly quicker. bullshit. 

Why pretend virus deaths important car deaths acceptable?? .. we... Go.

Deaths. Lag. Cases. backwards. far rather Ontario (Where live) what's one extra case. place cases damage. wonder much money private schools loosening come fall? agree. always good idea plan A, B, C disasters. Wow. HCQ still politicized media even truth came studies saying dangerous debunked partisan hackery.

How many deaths corrupt media directly responsible for? wasn’t man 😂 connecting now. must I'm reading much pro China news days No, okay. Inmates prisoners people, there's nothing worry about.

^^/s yea governor assured everyone plenty safe... Like right now, large number cases younger age brackets. might take even longer older brackets get infected another two weeks happens. deaths may lag even longer round. Though today looking number deaths Worldmeters, looks bad. oh man, never though click X... 35 days could work pretty dang well tight everything forced masked contactless.

But that’ll never happen. Fuck guy. put perspective - one day we’ve many deaths Japan TOTAL. wish random ass country like Tibet Liechtenstein. countries would stop fucking countries power plays. dilusional pipe dream know, I'm exhausted every one wanting fuck everyone else essentially zero risk contract either disease, bother? 
Getting flu shot would first potential chance get infected COVID-19? 
If working company office shopping he’ll yeah I’d get flu shot. 
Since fully isolated though, upside getting flu shot. positivity rate tests per cápita tell that. Brace slut puppies, aint yet. comparing apples oranges though.

Well, apples retarded Americans... fucking stupid? Read comment wank stain. article clearly says ""A man travelling United States entered Nova Scotia...""

I said ""send back"". assumed ""back USA"".

Read fucking comment. Honestly- think Fauci would back pedal this, kids germ factories, may get bad case Covid19- become super spreaders parents get spread around offices work places. guess family member’s employer already knows holiday. person take time work unless lied co-workers, boss HR, someone must know traveling. hope facility work would ask screening questions request employees unnecessary travel (like family vacations), can’t always get want. Finland is. frankly given covid patients often need whole team keep alive, there’s huge chance standard care dropping beds run out. 

Texas seeing patients ventilators run two people standard 4 per ventilated patient. can’t really successfully run ventilator one nurse/dr/medical personnel, even two people can’t run well four. different culturally US create bias, assumption may made outsider / foreigner. probably safe assume (or tell) white people Germany German. question get asked white people US, they're assumed American. Asian people get treated Yes Tuesday highest Tuesday month. that’s bad line experts saying deaths rising. Source? happens state relies heavily tourism income. Tourism equals social interaction. days, social interaction means potentially getting sick. 

People need think make better decisions. Wtf image article sign view??? What? still planning open? Allow reopen allow non-employees inside. traveler wasn’t even American. He’s foreign national somewhere Canada America passed US way Canada. Read fucking article spouting off. TIL going need 25 thousand celebration finding lawyer dumb enough lie courtroom hope. level trusworthiness pandemic. afterwards (~2 years now). lack trustworthiness problem, actions people take address problem? DeFloridaMantis list Texas schools support virtual learning? politician. scripted reality tv show host steak salesman. That's completely false. list countries much invoiced US gone, China highest contributor. like country looks leadership. president public servant (emphasis servant), cult leader. remember guy telling governors reopen economy That’s American way. That’s every first world nation reined spread. People taught insanity. fears ignorance due job insecurity rural living exacerbated repetitive nature talk radio Fox News (or Canada’s equivalents). gotta fight fight right party world went absolutely crazy. think understand Sheriff is. officers state.

Wear N95 mask equivalent (like TM2020, DIY) goggles shrink risk acceptable size. current argument BaCkLoG 4th JuLy! semi true someone said calculate four day average last week week higher last week. think he’s exactly like Fastest goalpost moving seen while! Literally got back week stay confirm one masking. live SC mask situation makes SC seem like model PPE usage. don’t think people good math small businesa owners get assistance based skin color?? I’m assuming bunch yeehaw sheriffs refuse cooperate. Damn White House Coronavirus Task Force killin thoughts decentralization technology would eventually help common person become self sufficient? mean is, imagine 10 20 years (I know.. long..) countries ability sustain plentifully dependent trade? don’t know ins outs international dependence. Exactly would take vaccine “approved “ FDA election- may well drink bleach dozens us, DOZENS!!! unavoidable

I doubt that. Cars boats always option, going. “Mask mask transmission”... still people respect space... That's need, friend. wear mask get vaccine rolling done part. 

Keep mind I'm germaphobic nurse, though. I'm minority wanting mask wearing continue past COVID. cases surging, deaths lowering NE think it’s win. Well, Florida already breaking records COVID deaths almost daily, 3-4 weeks recent huge surge turn tons deaths. 

At point, disappear move goalposts claim, like people ilk do, never used metric like cases hospitalizations. looks like mis-spoke, refused intubation - essentially invasive ventilation. (ventilation mask tube, intubation, skip mask eat tube).

I idea much say parents get get this. I'm side planet, often slightly different takes individual rights like this. bad there? American equivalent Chinese welding people homes. don’t know I’m disturbed existence ‘COVID parties’, implication they’re apparently common OP doesn’t need explain is. Congrats, Boston. hard road. That's one! Amazing.  Leadership standing interests people represent. Supporting corrupt organization clearly co-opted authoritarian country pretty much antithesis that. holiday weekend surprise Monday down. Weds -Fri week give clear indication direction going, betting up. Question: know long term effectiveness and/or risks trials sped along fast?

Are looking flu vaccine efficacy MMR vaccine efficacy here?

I'm confident people get vaccine 60% American public can't bothered get flu vaccine yearly.

I'll listening closely Fauci consensus scientists vaccine gets approved. thought well, department definitely ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ North Florida panhandle, essentially lower bama Georgia. for-profit healthcare system keeping things around 90% ICU efficient. begins. We’re going miss numbers couple weeks unfortunately. fact getting downvoted . . . Well....they work feel safe.

So. issue? Born grew germany asian background dont mind question. 

Never faced malice combination question, never came across something feel offended about. time question comes curiosity.

Even born germany, still grew different experiences, parents different culture. live St Louis Missouri I've three tornadoes come within half mile house one funnel cloud house. neighbor's house across street 40 yards away see whatsoever hail wall came down.

By way Texas Florida announced reopening schools school learning fall even pandemic states coming control. Yelling “no, no, no!” Doesn’t stop covid blithering idiot. I’m sick politicians using handlers deal press they’re pathetic make ridiculous demands journalists. Fuck that, wants stop reporter damn dirty work pay consequences instead unseen lady him. damage saliva test accurate nasal? Reason ask MLB player tested negative nasal test, positive saliva, negative nasal test again. nice... Using worldmeter, US approx 134,000 deaths today Canada 8,700. hard take solace lowering death count numbers already history books. electoral college decided by...? 

Rich people hubdreds years ago order tilt political power favor slave holding states. fuck???  remember people celebrating lockdown ended, proclaims ""the worst behind us"" ""bright days ahead"" -- saying rates continue decline.

Did people seriously expect this? Cases trending downward lockdown restrictions. get everything goes back normal....beaches packed, restaurants packed, crowded events.....I shocked careless people attending crowded July 4th celebrations zero social distancing.....now we're worse ever. I'm glad police discretion. would really suck get ticket every single time cop sees 2 MPH speed limit. many make now? one-day thing includes carryover last three days. know COVID takes weekends off, 4th 3-day weekend. Watch 7-day rolling average (although three-day weekends throws day), daily total.

OP gave wrong link, btw:  predict it'll be? unconstitutional. trust way trust anything comes White House, gonna lie. I'm hoping survive next 4 months! Part definitely tied holiday weekend. example Arizona reported 1 death yesterday 117 today. Probably bunch states catching long weekend. Novavax alone. three companies Phase 3 money -- Moderna, AstraZeneca Johnson &amp; Johnson -- also use technology never resulted marketed vaccine. 

I'm saying anything improper, wonder much companies contributed re-election campaigns. wow, can't even keep today. much ""deaths declining"" talking point. Deaths also starting spike, it’s going ugly July August appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* reported ""uncivil"" post 0 political comment, though say situations $ucked. I've learned reword comment mentions states leader &amp; others since political replies (in posts specifically political leaders/people) removed. That's think people disagree &amp; automod. wondering others picked well. Pretty sure trolls following me, I've blocked see replies get personal messages me. Ivanka? 38 old? might considered loss people weren’t already co-opted China begin with. already rich people using riches help businesses own, buddies controlled access cares act funds made sure leave loopholes help make campaign contributions get free money taxpayer trough exchange campaign contributions...and know it. 

This need term limits. thing lifetime politician top levels... going start school fall become nurse midwife. way I've seen healthcare workers treated, many died, way people responded pandemic, much totally rethinking career move well.  I've followed nurses online they've lost lives,while I've heard nurses enough ppe... Even heard nurses threatened work ( without proper PPE) reported abandoning patients. horrible healthcare workers treated us. even think comment strictly related Harvard, applied really college. Think type people are...you'll answer. understand perfectly well nature way are, thanks |de0l0gy (which b@nned word). Sure, 50 deaths cases counted today alone. adds quick. fact, Florida added 3,841 dead far. died 9/11 much finished. Again, one staying ""stay closed forever"" (and ... know health experts) asking states stay closed long enough ensure people needlessly die. 

Also, neither us predict future, would bet New York comes better Florida. people want complain civil liberties taken away we're mandating masks. FUCKEN FOOLS  actually. FDA does. Covid tracking daily, worldometers.info overall per capita nose spells drinking heavily. didn’t used look like that. Nothing guarantees downvote someone sure something related Covid. least people die ignorance ignoring hurricane warnings, families neighbors dont catch hurricane stupidity die too. 

When contagious, risk lives want. virus risking everyone else's too. really hope shut beaches next days partner's vacation cancelled. Even they're following guidelines I'm scared daughter. Shes preemie mom may already infected. I'm letting go I'm worried they'll catch they're there. Good joke.

Have heard China, India, Phillipines, Mexico, among 100+ countries? Pretty darn sure places lower pay, employment standards, existing infrastructure. 

Let go? funny because

A) people complaining jobs exported overseas 

B) want tax rich, group people ""let go"".

I swear people dont use brains anymore. deaths starting accelerate big 4.

its harder parse stats due reported regular drops reporting weekend. warmer weather comments White House misled southern states.  saying people misled idiots.  Iran worst first outbreaks.  didn’t listen scientific evidence  race joke, would categorize intentional racism... that's bad joke... like tall people get asked play basketball every day life. see point duration system working. many, US isn’t healthy Finland. Finland example 14 percent fewer obese people, say obesity huge risk factor.

But hand, Finland smokes drinks more. two things huge well. Would interested see group healthier overall. people idiots?

None people downvoting got harvard, guarantee you. Otherwise would understand exactly i'm recommending. people think gap year giving slot, opposed taking year (which right do).

Parents kids got harvard also understand exactly i'm saying - spend 60 grand year sub-par education right skip year.

People DONT go schools assume ""Whatever still get harvard degree"". Yeah, still get take gap year pick back fall 2021, that's dumb argument. Nobody wants go harvard wants go harvard way, nobody GETS go harvard *has* go harvard way. 

They downvote idea i'm talking about, that's fine. Families harvard students getting strategic advice comments section, anyway. elect young president would face change others look say, that's new america... ow wait. Never mind. know founding fathers designed police force part checks balance system yeah, also infiltrated/threatened FBI anywhere everyone wearing mask. cutting funding corrupt organization? That’s called ‘having spine’, throwing tantrum. still highly edited hide violence. PTSD huge problem US. sign fun advertisement, destroyed emotionally, physically, true horrors war. bear eats ribcage devour heart organs..... ""just click link"" send payment, china. pretty much ignored everything said virus originated. way stop 3-month national lockdown. Jesus take wheel wind comes sweeping plain? Yes cloth face mask ""supposed"" stop (by collecting itself) thing trying avoid.

Let's wear that, fondle it, stuff pockets keep reusing it. Can't tell I'm paranoid chest beginning feel congested/tighter usual breathe Non American interests already control it, obviously. can’t think anything dumber supporting obvious CCP propaganda misinformation outlet US tax dollars. get downvoted?  albeit possibly BRIEF view,  Also note test gave monkeys 1/2 normal dose vaccine blasted significantly higher viral loads anyone would naturally encounter. still develop severe symptoms. hope mask wearing becomes norm people sick on. Even cold. Oklahoma view That's kid dies, adults would part elect death would go hell.

Hell, even kid one day older ""age accountability"" whatever fuck is, would go hell died without elect. goes bid presidency coworker who, last year, gave severe flu TWICE due covering mouth coughing sneezing- one people refuses wear mask. frustrating! *really* wanted let out. yeah sorry lol wouldnt let upload direct link usa link uploaded past two days go neighbours haha Exactly. college university people need socialize. Pretty hard make friends taking online classes. begins. doesn't. That's countries sovereigns. people something rhymes ""tight-zingers"" want Aut0-M0d catch me. claimed ""not part US""

So, 4th world right, since can't produce water handle sewage food. Good troll, I'mma done feeding you. fun clueless naive Amennnnnnn suspected. go. Community transmission detected France China identified virus, found Brazilian sewage month China identified it. NYC outbreak seeded European fights. virus global, China first outbreak, pay reparations all?

Reparations line fails recognize China ability control countries respond virus. Japan, Korea, New Zealand, Taiwan done well. America, India Brazil failed completely due stupidity incompetence. 

If virus actually created US Army lab Ft Detrick, got Wuhan Military Games, what? Would demand America pay reparations? Brazil?

China, Korea, Taiwan, etc. detecting infections people coming America Europe. much America countries pay failure prevent infected people traveling countries? paid smart kid take SAT reason go back normal vaccine. seems pretty well. degree guys reopened? HoLy BaLLs MaKes MuCh eaSieR.

FTFY still increase seven day rolling average calculate EOD. 

It’s still nine hundred additional avoidable deaths. know know transactions take-out? We're testing 1700 per million people day puts us bottom half states rate testing.   Texas second largest population though. 81%. 19% currently attacked wolves, unconscious drinking case labatt, still busy mourning tragically hip notice? I’m curious. would health insurance providers love paying hundreds thousands dollars? treatment vaccine Confirmed deaths vs tested cases. Confirmed dead vs untested, would less. far people without tested. theory hospitals fudging covid death numbers baseless hoaxers say hospitals labeling deaths covid. Overall death numbers significantly April, even despite increased case loads AZ, FL, TX etc. think they’ve stopped recording deaths? One day, probably many moons now, states realize indoor dining passing credit cards cash spreading virus. also realize rooms offices multiple people inside also high potential spreading virus.

If group scientists could publish papers provide facts... maybe even share organizations long denied facts... /s heard miss apple family emergency well Indoor dining thing right now. Fauci right. People nothing attitude this. Locked down, open. One other. pro opening. somethings high risk benefit carry. Open streets restaurants instead cars like cities did. better city anyways. Close gyms let hold classes parks. Don’t allow people fucking worship inside! many nice places outside! don’t sacrifice much open wisely. problem anti-mask degenerates might also anti-vaxxers. zombies would actually took vaccine. get worst worlds... Lol  40, believe 32 experiencing ""larger increases"" surges. 8 states probably experiencing minimal increase nothing major cant focus day day rates. Reporting weird country goes depending day. better compare Mondays previous mondays, etc. said, yesterday today mark first time deaths gone compared previous week. Could nothing, could sign what's come. feel end week know stand. name makes want vomit Lol kind  $ *It typically takes decade develop vaccine - many efforts fail produce one all.* 

But time, different, I'm sure... errr... right? Hello? need go jail point exactly.... places cold colder Melbourne, able stamp virus nothing winter fact cold matter. still matters Melbourne. It’s really heartbreaking see. sure watch daily numbers like hawk (I do) USA overall today seeing highest daily todays since June 10. rough predictions (which surprisingly accurate) showing peak around 4,600 deaths/day nationwide end July. preventable. :( Yeah, well, unfortunately, that's exponential growth does. Anyone else feel utterly defeated administration? point, barring Rona sweeping taking out, hope get vast majority November, next admin even take January. lot damage now. appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* big problems lack beds. lack staffing bigger problem. Healthcare workers burnout, get sick, die, straight quit think aspects lives take precedence (i.e. parent kids).

They truly heroes difficult time. deserve much support, gratitude, PAY. 10 hours Trump tweeted deaths plunging. Man knows shame. Guess wont see tweeting tomorrow!

worst is... bound get worse. Everyday number patients ICUs increase includes backlogged deaths long holiday weekend big picture point abolished progress made March-April stay home orders lockdowns. two weeks we’ll another wave holiday weekend. I'm going piggy back leave this, ""Bar Lives Matter""

Really gives great example 

A) amount racism still overtly present East Texas. ""protest"" lawsuit originated Kilgore, TX. Kilgore right road Jasper, TX, still hotbed KKK activity. Looking recent events taken place faint heart. been... Don't. small exception visiting Texas Oil Museum!


B) appalling state public education state Texas. fucking phrase makes absolutely damn sense. going steal mock spearhead major equal rights campaign, least fucking clever it. Psycho dan. cowboy dan. hope so, clear quick vicious backlash roll back anymore. unemployment numbers make really rough month. company says there’s vaccine.

I hate working home :-( think bad US def worse kinda convo. nuke it? Okay.. bad idea Source? Eh, let perfect enemy good enough. *Most* people smartphone, *most* smartphones running iOS Android within last major versions. system like could even reach double digit market penetration secondary system uploading contacts (so someone tested positive refused/was unable turn location data could still manually entered would say general went when) would still helpful.

The real issue, many said (and alluded to) nobody trusts government use system like responsibly. cause would immediately get invaded we'd go occupy it. 🙄 logical fallacy today false equivalency. Comparing Islamic attack 9/11 virus pure stupidity. Florida fine. We’ll revisit numbers come back show states like NY retardation always worse. let’s ignore Texas hospitalizations quadrupled last month several regions starting run low room.

Don’t knock bbq boneless wings pub pretzels w/ dip Wow really scary. Thank heads up! hope gets well soon absolutely right saying let doctors scientists work right thing do.

Xi lead wearing mask actually. medical expert Zhongnanshan told entire nation wear masks.

I'm saying 'CCP bad'. I'm saying Xi anything worth praising. Tr\*mp makes Xi look like much-better leader. sounds like absolute worst version Groundhog Day:


“Amid ongoing questions calls additional investigations, staff members say still reeling saw heard: dead rolled body bags names toe tags ever-present, unwelcome sound taps speaker system, notice yet another death. Standing alongside nurses listening bugles play, residents dementia often could remember dinner night would slowly remove hats.

I'm it- feel bad people believe threat can't thing it.

Everybody else? Time natural selection. dumb blowhards living Mountain Dew pizza getting paid table pay child support world favor wearing mask.

They're gonna need front-end loaders bury bodies street, but, maybe ""Florida Man"" die them.

Florida hospitals suck good day. Give us another month we'll throwing much higher death rate anywhere else- is, ever gets reported correctly.

The local hospital even employ emergency department- temps agency cut lawsuits. That's much suck. Can't wait whatever temp keep job anywhere else come intubating. Last time there, took 4 people start IV. number fluctuate significantly. testing gets overwhelmed, lines become huge, waits become huge people less likely want confirm case. all, case mild, much confirmed result you.

We saw death rate drop lot new cases good indication people getting tested. rise looked like 2.5 every 1 case missed.

Unfortunately testing becoming less less accessible, true case confirmed case ratio rise dramatically. insane metal gymnastics people. Everyone internet access around world knew since January. admit take seriously March.. know what? public health expert, virologist, epidemiologist. US fault getting citizens situation pulling going make problem go away. Exactly. OP went well way make political post, rules. person actually answered question posts. seen numbers posted elsewhere. IFR north much damage president question right president? Coronavirus Update: Random reddit poll finds American, agree. Cool problem all. It’s specifically RVs I’m talking totally understand point. patience people attacking people damaging vehicles without knowledge situation. haven’t even said shit vacationing families see; turn around find another way I’m going.

Edit: suggest putting note window. It’s sad simple note back front window explaining she’s quarantining help family likely save issues. Good luck. no, colleges think so, Trump think take Corona run course percent infections reported. would lots asymptomatic cases, plenty people feel bad enough go doctor, people afraid go doctor they're afraid they'll get it, etc. 

Europe divided separate countries saw thing, typically weeks apart, quite consistently peak 5-10 weeks in, steady decline. 

The problem everyone expected US peek way, reality spread out. lock downs work sense, cases really spread, also issue disease run course many parts country. things opening people traveling around flaring up... like every part world. look cases country whole, look state unique situation.

Also, Americans tired lock downs, we're extra resistant anything it.

Corona run course, that's nature does. stands, curve flattened like we'd hoped, also advantage know better treat stuff lack PPE ventilators, etc pretty subsided we're better place handle this.

It's going suck lot people. 38 lower previous weekend's low, 33 lower Sunday that. today's spike 200 higher last two weeks' peaks. Source? Source? Pretty sure reasons hospital covid19. jumping blaming profit healthcare? comment getting fired, nothing ""profit,"" means employed. people seem understand majority hospitals US either government run non-profit.

Ah yes, Dr. Fauci director NIAID, moderator r/coronavirus !! Well, said downvoted oblivion Indians every time. may American, I've Indian hospital. private hospitals way better equipped public ones still seriously lacking. last government shutdown dragged month ended instantly airports close  I’m american. keep closed. borders closed awhile anyway. aren’t idiots. oh, know. infection rate testing done *is* positive, REALLY enough province opened right now.

Greetings Canada's hell zone -- mean hot spot us favor fuck Good, mean people stop complaining US stopping illegal immigration? Big meeting happening November 3rd, you’re invited really go Asian grocery stores restaurants take precautionary measures much seriously places. Asian people also lowest coronavirus infection rate America. 

Of course responsible hard working people always least respected.  California crowded anyway. time prepare this. Friend's wife went Canada visit family 3 months ago, think finally allowed come back  Covid kills dead people OC, I'm calling little Florida, resident, F@CK ME. thought maybe 1000 yesterday artifact holiday weekend, nope. thousand 2 days row worrisome trend. Wear mask Karens Brahs!

""The state’s coronavirus dashboard gave 11.2% test positivity rate county. ""

I went grocery shopping tonight maybe 1/2 people wearing masks. whole family 5 mom dad 3 little girls masks. Ughhhh. Yikes. kind cool shit? demand let us see really think China lying numbers everything read seen past 6 months? infection numbers make sense virus spreading since December. examples response compared rest world:

1. Government response hard stern compared almost every country world. cracked hard it.
2. Mask wearing culture pretty welcomed East Asia difficult people actively wear masks.
3. average citizen took seriously wanted prevent virus spreading. videos Italy mayor city broadcasting drone tell everyone get inside. April, Northern Italy got hit hard. 

Are saying China's numbers 250,000 cases like Western Europe response much heavy-handed? 3 million like US? Ugh. I’m sorry it’s come this. hate us too. I’m incredibly frustrated way US handled pandemic. Well, gonna worse India given population ( 1 billion people ). 3 times higher USA's population. gonna massacre.  rush says corona surgery.  Wtf realize complicated than, ""Just mandate it,"" right?

When leadership position, everything trying get people want do. done facts (and asking), punitive systems positive rewards systems.

How get people absolute selfish morons, put mask? get people social distance? think $500 fine would good enough? Many people care got caught.

The reason Trump praising Newsom California huge state ""weren't problem"" way New York was. That's ok. win November someone narcissistic voted in.   Let tell you, HUGE groups. Clubs packed states cities. lot people masks drinking, eating, dancing shoulder shoulder club. Lakes packed, people huge get togethers. ridiculous seeing snapchat. play battleship district voted open schools yesterday. Today get email school asking parents donate disinfectant wipes able procure enough. 

This going fine. 🤦‍♀️ virus can't spread school campuses packed full thousands people! Literally many infections happened schools last 3 months? Zero.

Checkmate libtards. better question is, given that, expect happen? expect cases keep going deaths keep going down? wear mask thought that, it’s weird include T. chance approved people say ""theres vaccine"" Asymptomatic really honestly difficult concept grasp. Cooking easy. People don’t like prepping, serving, washing dishes. 8 5. Michigan, masks required current phase. Also comments today commander saying schools must open 100% scares me. can't even little league game without transmitting virus. Unless plan bringing us back dial-up modem’s end social media, house ain’t getting rebuilt many people separated family due border closures - certainly care. Good luck you, Internet Scientist knows doctors. Bad bot. agreeing original comment. Thanks deleting moment civility agreement two opposing political sides. you’re telling it’s months still don’t understand why??

Also, alternative trusting politicians epidemiology PhDs? It’s literally Fauci saying this. It’s vast majority epidemiologists, all. tell him. think I've tried facts already? almost people medical issues covid19.  people think going accomplish nonsense? getting ""gotcha"" this. Deal it. wont. should. wont. vaccine turns viable safe, best believe im getting Oxford tattoo baby  Yeah, understand reason downvotes, I'm offensive, asking India third-highest number coronavirus cases globally, eighth-highest number deaths worldwide. However, terms growth rate Covid-19 deaths, India's numbers exceed According health ministry data, India recorded 16,893 deaths June 30, spiked 19,693 July 6 - growth rate 2.6 per cent global average 0.9 per cent period.

So much small initial progress, that's unlimited exponential growth does. Buy food - mask on

Yep, keep things wheels now, even tie down. hurts agree someone significant Canada, right call now.  


Guess it'll year least see rate. :( Uhh already data. They've since dialup days. Google prism. Yeah hey, US *barely* anything March, they're still nothing. many cases, like Florida, they're worse nothing. Maybe tweet soon: 
*The fake news funded China. Tremendous corruption! exit socialist organization, virus go away fast. watch - fake tests!*

Scariest part reality.

Canada 37MM people, 2MM. way compare countries differing sizes compare numbers per capita:

Canada - 231

So yes, Canada much better job US, particularly close. Less withdrawal patients? Sign up!  USA buy make scarce next months nurse commented right sub people ICU need there. waiting test results ER turned large waiting room filled healthy people.  apparently reading hard someone doesn’t like anything journal articles cited...


Estimated 45% people need long term care. Idgaf “recovered” meaningless word would prefer people took plague seriously doubt there's increase

Try reading. insane. pandemic reaches unprecedented levels, American authorities best cases nothing, worst cases actively work hurt people attempt prop failing economy that's getting worse response worsening health crisis. many Americans left jobs, income, health insurance, slim chance avoiding covid? they're leaving political nonsense? fucking bananas. Victims don't, sure though. I'm done, fun peering depths righty stupidity though, good luck convincing people climate change BELIEVERS cause anti science idiots, drunk drivers may stop murders happening. endless source things make fun of. 

Good luck getting anybody like single one posts. Americans really help lol good point, guess that's chosen one authors. “It could terrible time stop”. dangerous thing say, I’m honestly shocked dude downvoted.

Preliminary/non-peer reviewed research never applied clinical recommendations. One retrospective preprint used tell someone stop smoking. Smoking worst thing body, good century research back Good news, took long? third world countries mandatory everywhere since 1-2 months ago. asia since forever. scathing write-up Florida COVID Victims site, Jones described church gathering “COVID Party.” alleged Brunton Davis took Carsyn event “intentionally expose immuno-compromised daughter virus.”
Brunton Davis church reportedly behind event could reached comment late Monday night Yeah it’s hard ignore refrigerated trucks people turned away ER, stadium hospitals, etc. coming weeks. It’s lot easier ignore numbers paper. Guess we’ll see. Please stop Lives nonsense. (I'm assuming Asian, since chan username) Asian Americans want movement, need start it, time. Trying start counter movement peak BLM nothing take away BLM. 

If saying Lives Matter Asian Lives Matter important before, speaking (yes, I'm generalizing, specifically)? expect people fight us, many injustices would love get addressed BLM front page news right mean start, response unpopular, Lives Matter, Black Lives Matter.

it speaking Asian people. speaking BLM.

Here great source information going months ago too. remember seeing states 0 deaths one day, bunch next. It’s getting really hard hate people nowadays Like one M. Night Shyamalan twists. See agree still think it’s stupid fuck pull it. shows need involved hold accountable, let China whatever fuck want it. deaths surprisingly low though considering increasing rates...and think young people  Remember feeling someone says ""I dont see take math, much math actually need know life? calculator phone hurr durr"" ran one. exactly cons withdrawing? ignore shortcomings? lot states, day reporting really thing go by. 

For example: Arizona's deaths mostly backlog weekend according deaths day graph. are, add July3-6 32 deaths. means rest deaths actually point last week (or week knows). 

My state NC way. Deaths get reported week. 

By time notice trend usually already deep shit. Canada COOL. COOL COOL COOL. THANKS NUTSACKS. We’re pretty well think would like keep way. many things, seeing bad COULD way southern neighbour galvanizing effect. (I mean, took pretty seriously begin with, continued effort easier abide look south) Hypothalamic-Pituitary Axis Dysfunction, Morbid Obesity, Bronchial Asthma posts people, people feel truely intellegent. sarcastic. mean it. posts, things ive seeing news? people still like ""I GOTTA PAY MAH CREDIT CARD BILLZ THIZ HOAX""

&amp;#x200B;

Dude. stopped paying everything phone bill, rent. credit cards screaming me, money now, send collections what? Come fall go back lock gonna do? Arrest me? cant. thing debtors prison america. Yet.  Yes! Username checks seems crazy US left WHO. Especially pandemic. Yeah, that’s fair. Fine... I'll said human human whole time, wrong entire time. US realized utter shit act. late. whole northeast Europe already infected running rampant. 

Coincidence sudden china shut city, weld doors shut, systematically kill virus totalitarian control? Nope, pretty much planned would assume. Probably coincidence also came right terrible economy crippling tariff war sanctions. Consider devastating death toll would trying herd immunity, consider survive still left permanently fucked covid. 

Also consider 1% herd immunity, likely COULDNT get herd immunity anytime soon without going full-apocalypse. less two percent die? never welded people apartments. video referring welding alternate exits building could account enter left. There's evidence widespread act well.

Also, done 1/1000th China contain coronavirus. media never ever showed steps they've taken. fair Nursing Home.  Exactly. going pay externalities? Cheaper pay closed let open cost community there's super spreading outbreak. Unfortunately can’t. I’ll let guess why. Happy see WHite House working something. Definitely time Covid pandemic chaotic plan except pretend virus go away own. Everybody ignoring shit wrong dismissed. probably effect us. know yet mortality numbers spiking well? delay detected spikes? data counting? testing picking people before? okay locust shit everywhere! gutters, windows, cars. hell lets get vents shit too. That's one interpretation. crooked, associate them? gain us? Yeah. Jefferson [created version Bible, miracles taken I’m sure would favor dismissing science.

Never thought hiking would risky makes sense Tag good news Lol, Canada close 40M people. numbers let's spread misinformation . couple months anyway. 

Agreed. Please delete comment :) 978,477 last 25 days, average 39,000 new cases per day. 

 Current observed CFR US 4.3%.

4.3% 978,477 42,074 going get way worse. 

You take 7-day rolling average new cases, look 7-day rolling average deaths occurring week *after* get pretty good extrapolation many people end dying based new case volume.

We're continuing see 1.8%-2%+ fatality rates based metrics.

A week ago seeing ~34k cases/day, we're seeing ~650 deaths/day resulting that.

We went from:

16k avg 6/7 

28k avg 6/21 to

55k avg 7/7

A week we'll probably seeing ~1100 deaths/day. 

These numbers sensitive mortality % well, hospitals become overcrowded, demographics skew older again, mutates, run PPE whatever, could much higher. hit 3%, we're suddenly 1650/day.

Given ""not dead, still fks life"" outcomes, people **really** playing fire taking seriously. keep trying tell husband upset brother says hoax~ I'm sure judge that, pretty sure I'd say yes lot things $20 million. can’t confirm via text though. Can’t send random text out

HIPAA Can't schools open half teachers &amp; staff members sick. Who's going teach kids? words, “Stupid stupid does”. good news deaths still keeping pretty low despite risen infection rates now. Start conversation differently. Also persistent. STDs day every day covid came around. ways. Really depends specific situation. stand\^ Fuck old piece salt water soaked leather. know, population density usually held hindrance pandemic control right? space lock healthy people sick. Yes possible, follow strict rules, social distance ever possible ADAPT. possible, done.

 problem people dont seem care, dont follow rules, parades masks shit.
Opening schools least concerns.

 years years people ready kids kids arent ready kids showing. Scary time american. Operation Dumbass continues. could possibly station someone every single road leads state?

Maybe every road, major ones. Use police, military national guard needed, matter national security.. went war 3,000 deaths anything save hundreds thousands even suppose see cases imported NY/NJ/CT state governments could deploy state police try close state borders, right cost would outweigh potential benefit. NY enough testing capacity contact tracers find outbreaks get large. Remember state US could compared country EU. states much better others.

Why wait numbers go up? states peaking/rising like crazy, even take chance allow second third wave start went though first bad enough? Like potentially one case could start again.

I would rather proactive approach rather reactive one. using police border checks, using contact tracers hospital staff instead cost even resources resources ample supply like military national guard.

To that's exactly military NG used for. Defending country saving American lives. making lies kill Muslims side world pose threat. studies done take U.S. coronavirus death toll ‘a substantial undercount’ actual tally, Yale study finds Canada like 2M.

Lol comment makes feel kind bad.

We sent dog doggy daycare 5 years. Paid 400 month. since March. keep texting me, home, would pay amount money?

I want people lose jobs also want pay literally 400 month watch dog home Embedded journalists propoganda masterstroke know frequent serious chronic long-term side effects are.

If asymptomatic truly complication free know little more. 

If emerging series reports right, asymptomatic cases affiliated serious cardiovascular complications associated symptoms. feel clotty today? people know. 

We see clotting hospitalizations know everyone clots ends hospital. die heart attacks strokes home nursing homes. currently feel fine. may remain fine? one knows long term implications one hospital employee described blood like embalming fluid. Blood sticky, doctors never seen something abnormal.

So go back normal? know. doctors know. discharge patients, they're blood thinner dose 80 year old man. 

But cases blood issues. 

So, point would perfectly fine feeling adult ever need studied researchers? first months, thought flu. respiratory illness. kidney complication. blood disorder.

We learning new things virus time. discovered infects cells like Smallpox virus done. learned within last 30 days! Page found. Tuesday's number I'm worried people money could given priority saving life.

That valid concern. know organ transplants America look finances deciding get transplant. friend already told never qualify liver transplant insurance ability pay pocket. think article's wrong then, I've seen loads people NI online who've downloaded it. Hiking, risky? would say that? graph doesn’t say prefer wear shirt pants. delay seems likely number new cases UK dropped much. need enough people, hopefully placebo group, get infected. wonder since happening Utah, Mormon church setting example people wear masks?

They aren't. 

Source: Utah I’d call ATP (American Trump Propaganda.)

Comics make laugh I’m definitely laughing current situation. $80 curfew violation type crime prison attempting kill grandma type crime? pick up, sometimes puts list ‘people pick call’ they’ll keep calling. places pursue never answer. talking travel ban Turmp’s end-all, be-all answer protecting America virus? ban suppose make 13 cases go away magically without new cases occurring? 

By means travel ban bad definitely helped slow arrival early spread virus... ignorant think communicate America would enough stop virus. Citing March travel ban, present day’s time, counter-attack rebuttal Turmp Fauci even ignorant bragging would magically make virus go away. sure live physicians override parents parents demanding kill child. leads ugly legal battles it’s case parents want something idiotic that’ll kill child take on. Minorities 

*ftfy* What's worst case scenario thinking of? continually get reinfected die? reason that's wrong T-cells seem show memory immunity virus, meaning upon reinfection, virus longer ""novel"" less bad effects body. What’s even outrageous objectivists tend pretty wealthy afaik, one could assume could kept organization afloat Kochs pitch something. hypocrisy practically tangible. exception rule. job outdoor stuff, could wear mask would fogging glasses 24/7 making literally impossible job safely.

I understand people say ""I problem wearing masks!"" people like myself? Yeah, do. still wear mask go public even though fogs glasses end wearing job especially physical job? would impossible. 1,000 students entire district. people going listen Tom Hanks....fuck Anti-smoking crusader? year this? go check Beatles finally US tour? Next you’re going tell nothing keeps weight check like Virginia slim

It’s shit day honestly making laugh, thank Ah, everything progressing exactly foreseen. Good, good. yeah better equipped handle 19.5 days ago, got it

TMC would disagree took free Harvard course online. great. YouTubers much better teachers prestigious institutions. needs Texas Well like sheriffs refusing enforce. Send damn state guard, that’s exist for, police refuse job and/or state emergencies Cool, opinion piece IQ. It’s one metrics measure intelligence. There’s also GPA standardized test scores. doctors graduated 3.8 + gpas high MCAT scores. pretty good markers intelligence. American here. spend much military next... lose track... dozen countries. 

I want us scale way back throw money universal healthcare K-16 public education. That's President's specialty. certainly true.

There processes removing Sheriff office criminal charges them, state local officials cannot fire them. It’s true it’s tool shed, it’s easiest, least damaging tool shed. 

I compare drunk driving. 150,000 Americans died drunk driving accidents 4 months, there’s lot could try address that: make cars safer, put speedbumps, etc.

But, step one would get less people drive drunk first place. imagine half country hasn’t even outlawed drunk driving yet. course, save lives safer cars, it’s nearly useful don’t also try safer drivers, half country doesn’t even require safe driver director infectious disease Minnesota Department Health estimated could high 100 people infected every diagnosed MN.

Maybe everyone Florida already infected! quoted stats claimed fact, fucking Google them. burden proof me. I’m treating anyone one thing, “woke left” sound like mouth breather. You’re thick comprehend, know nothing me. claim facts can’t back up. “Statistics aren’t racist” lol classic talking point racist. One, show statistics, two, interpretation statistics absolutely be. wouldn’t know don’t two brain cells rub together. Think myself, lol comments getting downvoted oblivion simpleton. I’m making comments. don’t give single fuck anyone thinks. doesn’t make uncomfortable, happens sensible nuanced view your. “Black culture well bad! Black fathers leave! creating victims!” yet everyone thinks america dumb moving away morons worry I'm taking good care Québec, half Canada's fatalities, released numbers yearly death count, minus official Covid-19 related deaths, super close what's expected. I'd expect elsewhere less cases deaths anyway, anything deaths per capita Canada US even bigger official numbers say. possible, simple lagged plot cannot necessarily capture fact univariate situation, rather multi-variate one. hopeful hospitals better equipped handle situation given demographic...are better equipped health wise deal it. poor man. essentially job: help get American people viruses little negative impact human life possible. But, ya know, Trump.

Do think he'd appreciate ""Thank God Friday meme?"" Well look complied well. Lol boi irony 2020 thicc! look numbers, remained steady throughout. Seems like order open safely, need see CLEAR downwards path. merely steady. Okay. people need hospitalization, don’t admit room I'm sure quality hospitals Florida. beds converted used ICU type. heard Reddit. 3rd party. sad people would rather die admit wrong None mention discredits point. You’ve pointed attribute things God don’t explanation. doesn’t mean (that Christians religious followers) don’t try scientifically explore ourselves. 

Throughout history prominent scientists religious leaders followers, believed best way understand God understand world. Francis Bacon example followed scientific method hypotheses still taught schools today also believing God. Newton, dearly beloved physics students three laws, devout believer God. Again, argue can’t believe God also science? 

On resurrection: That’s good speculation, though highly unlikely given long Jesus cross basically bled out. Plus state medicine back then...

Finally, entire point supernatural events can’t proven God, you’re still substantiating claim science religion mutually exclusive. Unless someone received prophecy future event happens, isn’t way really prove supernatural events supernatural. know this. also acknowledge supernatural fact something natural. 

All prove comfortable leaving alone believing supernatural. what’s wrong that? everyone go solving every problem come across. Victims dont

Yet can’t explain Myers, expectedly. Maybe think trading injustice high horse Shetland pony Please cite amendment makes mandating masks federal level illegal?

Sure nut jobs far between. rural areas hit would bad shape available ventilators need be. Unfortunately LA county going shitter likely, unless take another 10 days more... make money people going ICU. Yeah, force someone pay ass treatment rest life. better pray keep health insurance. I’m NY dropped well hydroxychloroquine. it’s straight remdesivir problem US hospitals remdesivir nearly enough newly hit regions.

I still think study hydroxychloroquine zinc early mild cases preventative sort treatment treatment patients sick enough hospitalized. Even theoretical perspective would make lot sense use way. Yep, hate neoliberal/corporate Democrats pushing absurd propaganda based Republican fear mongering talking points. Well make sense places deaths would also undercounted deaths (total, least, percentage), right?

But here's stats Florida Texas approximately 4 times higher normal pneumonia, Georgia, 3 times higher.

I could keep going, don’t want sad. hate I’ve become person hopes watch grandchildren die gasping air, since kid supposed start college five weeks, am. Yeah except countries already peaked guys barreling full speed ahead ""They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists. some, assume, good people.”

just bafoon true, George Flloyd would marked COVID death. test positive afterall. actually people wanted put reason death, rather homicide. Oddly enough though they're people use argument underplay COVID. Whatever fits narrative time suppose. many people going claim can’t wear one medical reasons. 

Sorry that, please come back proof Coronavirus vaccination. jolly safe Disney day! ""Just common sense""?

It damages people's bodies. USA, USA, US ... cough, spits blood... Honestly? expect that. unfortunate mother father's deaths CoVid-19 are, say still alive caught CoVid-19 right **and properly treated early** would likely survived.

Even father poster boy extreme numbers pre-existing's. fair refused listen anyway It’s curious country suddenly found something else protest. addition to, instead of. cases people leave hospital drop dead next day two. Covid causes LARGE list issues. people tend cardiac arrests etc. actual lung killing breathing issue. I'm old enough remember kids' toys became increasingly bellicose. Guns shoot projectiles, current Vietnam kits GI Joe, remember toy land mine rubber band loaded. One would think...but no, happen either. US truly f---ed. people packing every enclosed space can. observations, less 10% folks currently wearing masks local grocery store -this, spite signs demanding them. care, loads bound die. unfathomable.

If live US, likely months away watching inevitable implosion remains US economy. lack leadership appalling. US officially confirmed place world nation self-righteous, narcissistic, uneducated morons.

I embarrassed call American right now. People need wake TF up. agree there’s numbers bad, thats stupid comparison. Oc hardly protests, bars restaurants cases right left privileged fucks around refuse wear mask. Yeah think CA understands virus Great another half assed lockdown.  worked well before. I'm downplaying all. live gulf coast. Everyone always talking crazy people evacuate, completely ignoring large percentage population literally means leave.

There nothing done people class, unless good Samaritans help them. last night like world's run neighborhood Literal translation: better nothing use paper clip tighten mask, vids youtube clear.  sorry hear, trying help.  Clearly you, I'm surprised go ""they need add zero's number."" worst part American family... live close Sumas border cousins Auburn Kirkland far really may well live moon. know I'll able see time soon. 

Damn Covid dummy president. USED super effective! OT plate? ...most people know actually. Anyone sane Yes. scam liberal US higher education exposed hopefully collapse. Forget code, learn weld. took exception ""free day care parents"" portion. pay fuckload taxes, day care services offer kind suck. Sounds like Butters is, I'm sorry hear sure exponential growth anything rough ideas. growing exponentially live haven’t long time. Canada, Germany many get infected 100% vaccine made foreseeable future. America, Brasil, India, Mexico similar countries like could possibly see insane increases huge infection rate. 

The thing is, gets bad 1000’s bodies city cant even get buried sit cooler trucks, would imagine slightly competent country would stop exponential growth.

This virus proves grows exponentially, believe start doubling every 5 days, world proven halted completely eliminated. Now, look word “IF” previous comment. generally used help define something could possibly happen.
Would say Canada, Germany, Norway growing exponentially significant way? say countries pretty well managed last months small probability even see 5% population infected time vaccine ready.

Edit: would like add, even without lockdown controlled. know more, systems place, trace better. point get low enough medical teams trace isolate cases manage growth. South Korea didnt lockdown like italy theyre amazing.

So no, lockdowns thing slow growth.  stadium need place fit people, well ventilated, keeps people separated. started eating janitors closet due this. number worsening city set goal go way avoid becoming ill or, barring that, becoming ill tail end pandemic early treatment avaliable. Whoa, check badass county positivity rate 14.2 Dude washed up. Anyone pretended ever give shit says fleeing sinking ship. mean 19% Canadians total morons? Lower countries, guess... US giant dumpster fire right pandemic. absolutely bad looks. fact worse.  Refusal admit part problem addressing pandemic. US EU made huge proportion deaths April. EU managed get deaths almost nothing. US managed push deaths fair bit various stay-at-home orders. graph might show bit clearer: deaths going yet. Well that's combination factors. One testing likely fewer deaths new cases. many cases represent ""new"" outbreaks countries, deaths still lagging bit. Wait, mean closed right now? People justify make feel safer somehow. fact matter one predict turn anyone. know many people resigned getting one day waste time energy protective. realize hurting also others. I'd like point 1 billion people China also vested interest world health issues beyond simple power politics. go new job (changed schools work) today set email. two ladies wearing masks, also kept getting close talked LOUD. extremely aggravated. allowed enter building without mask. husband high risk pissed. another appt central office went inside, called asked wearing masks. may easier get people skipping year, guess would locked future years knocking basic requirements online semester/year. might bad semi-grifter scenario.

I think they'll get enough applicants. wonder Harvard relies Chinese students much university did/does? Well thank you. I’ll go put (keep on) mask now.  life I've wondered can't simply watch European TV. translated, censored, include regional news local advertising, give raw feed. Instead get shit like ""BBC America"". civil.  That's happened. Fauci admitted lied PPE shortage front line workers. problem lie people, regardless intent, diminishes trust. Yes, person thousands attendees. may hot cramped venue recirculating air conditioning unit help cool things bit. hold huge rally coronavirus awareness end singalongs go home families. /S introverts like ""what's problem staying home time?"" I've entire fuckin life. many people know? Bad hombres, Americans sounds correct. selling new tickets annual passes time. people going parks reopens current passholders people existing/rescheduled vacations. Vote. Get friends family vote. 

That's way make difference point. eys it. common sense. Smh Americans. Maybe best idea label heroes, might think they're sacrifice themselves. agree! I’m sad I’m wrong side :( House arrest.  Anything else waste time ran months ago. I’m Florida. town require people wear masks. horrible. definitely feel safe despite wearing n95 + surgical. basically risk life go fucking dentist much pain. Found later patients covid positive. cretins charge supporters blood hands reckoning. wanted commiserate. Willful negligence ego fear baby.. stock market falling apart. Sounds like similar experience. Unfortunately they're ones around seen Blue Bell gotta take chances guess. :P Mustang, OKC, Newcastle, Tuttle, Blanchard, Yukon, Harrah, Blackwell, Ponca City Purcell. masks ANYWHERE. 2nd day Zero domestic cases! would thought Italy, Spain, UK healthcare workers would gone worse. Probably though considering we're vaccine hunt. may problem longer developing countries though Tuesday usually highest deaths week. Friday Saturday case numbers highest. Imagine downvoting someone telling truth Glad worried China Florida, Texas...  Attempting convince everyone great job order get reelected obvious. knows base, knows like 'how simple speaks' proudly stated 2016 campaign. using words like 'China-Virus' claiming 'the best world X Z' base gets rock hard right hanging woodies that's that. scared science data suggesting anything already believe hear Trump say. equally frightening covid itself. Thankfully, doctors scientists American Academy Pediatrics concluded re-opening schools Fall safe. going trust? Teachers doctors? 19% polite I’m already eating plant based, happens! Terrible heart disease runs family, I’m surprised, probably would advanced vegetarian-ness.  death rate New York almost 8%?!! 

Why people still saying “true” death rate 1%? 

I understand everyone tested (though surely tested also dying, reports many deaths per day NYC usual) - aren’t many people tested even bit? didn’t contact tracing also work even bit? 8% insanely high Yeah, Mexico 42% test positive rate :( 

268k positive 642K tests total Good! Close shit! americans genuinely want go canada keep asses america instead posing risk awesome neighbors. Dont let us worlds spoiled child never listens cant follow rules. This, plus chingchongpingpongtingtonglinglong whatever else.

I've experienced racism blacks whites; somewhat awkward 3rd party looking ongoing racial issues U.S. going dancing? want schools open fall? really common one hear already, unfortunately Ahh US. warm welcoming place. Heyyyy! Y’all called it! Good job! Congrats! Let’s celebrate... wait,.. r/holup Fucking arrest them. absolutely fed people. listen. comply.  danger rest us need removed society IMMEDIATELY. blowback would nothing compared catastrophe quickly heading towards. Washington great system too! remember moved FL WA floored first ballot automatically showed mail without action me. amazing! yet throw fit can’t football fall people wouldn’t take precautions. guy ""Whatever hear leadership, wrong.""

I think he's run fucks give.  Listen I'm pro masks stepped foot inside building since Feb. 29. I'm generally cautious guidelines.

I also upset lied Fauci Surgeon General masks work. big mistake made.  Classic douche. nobody gives shit trump says anymore. understandable, tbh. yeah shit. americans dumb fuck ICE accidentally deported US citizens, really think fuck one well? countries around world used falsified data? Why? big conspiracy Trump? like arguments days. fucking depressing. dark cold environment Calling food bit reach  real takeaway? 19% Canadians want border reopened care.  American agrees. Stay healthy, Canada; want get sick. We'll stay home feel better. 3 million almost 1% entire population US (330 million).  majority always racist. That’s whites racists America. US 2 party system since beginning. everyone assumes mysterious 3rd party going solve things? There’s reason 3rd party candidates consistently account less 2-3% votes. iq 50 terrified president making statements. 

This anything funny florida packed. people going . rolling average making delay. 

The 7 day rolling average different purpose; weekends less reporting, 7 days average out. TIL LOLing online means one big pickle. imagining learn walk talk make wear mask.  hope understands pandemic gonna staying history book, together actions words administration also written history. people look back 100 years future, remember anything else 45th president, able read moment nation-wide total infection number hit 3M, said ""I think good place"". “How terrible know it’s lie aren’t prepared spread. deaths hands!”-People mad China downplaying numbers earlier pandemic.

“..”- people regards Florida. Greetings Northern Ontario - I've never loved remote.
Take care mon ami. Meanwhile maryland 500/day weeks. people dying, honest question. peak like 9k deaths March past weeks insane case spikes 5k (don't mean insensitive btw). 99% Florida hurricane experience. 1% sheer terror part. Conservatives care even die go bankrupt since they're cult  Azithromycin mild qtc prolongation. unlikely cause arrhythmia. combination qtc prolonging drugs ( hydroxychloroquine) people already prolonged qtc cause arrhythmia. low past weeks though, tuesday gotten close 1k deaths while. think safe assume things good deaths fact increasing. Meanwhile job stopped paying 'hazard pay' corona virus big threat anymore small business alright decided pursue PPP loan want unfairly take pile someone else might need it. makes angry. went Walmart today pick items; folks wearing masks... necks. today Records made broken. real difference Sweden's approach US? state, CA, never got 1 transmission rate, opened anyway. 

There mystery here. order contain virus, 1. Get transmission rate well 1, 2. Open slowly monitor progress expecting increase transmission overarching goal keeping 1, 3. Test trace hell local outbreaks. Since anyone involved Trump administration care allowed do? Agreed. one's us exactly one's worry about. blame wanting us stay here. still English! Unfortunately agree.. nobody cares anyone.. everytime go I'm person wearing mask seriously. got gas sheetz today probably 12 people inside nobody mask on, guy guy said ""look guy"" everyone line started laughing. dont understand. thoughts 4 months hard lockdown: grew used see like 290 daily deaths here.. 18 million. Took night pill underclocked brain cpu speed make ratio comparison. yiu math. 301k confirmed 18M population (5th world) fucked care much economic crisis going be. violence... lots violence...I never saw violence. probably coming 47 years back civil violence.. government treating lockdown unemployed, thought 20%. bet gonna happen i'm many places. OMS fucked Western world saying masks bad us. could steam machine 75% much layoffs WWII-like mass mask use campaign avoid criminal lockdowns dunno book money all. university probably vault gold somewhere campus. know TX governor intervene. last month short lockdown Texas. problem across country — cities state governments giving opposite guidelines. Even sheriffs Texas refusing enforce mask wear. shit stop — people lives stake here. sure they're Republicans Agreed. live border town. Tommorow Fox News, one thing make better response. President holds press briefing 3pm, one thing perfectly fine, finest people it. Ding ding ding. sane way decide things. come cities trying mitigate crisis State Fed shown leadership Also time infected death might month three got delay well. Legalize weed tax fuck use money support people.  I'm America think keep border closed. 

Next pandemic also need stop Americans returning home. gonna build big beautiful wall like nobody ever seen before. Nobody knew wall could built big beautiful. fact already started it, coming along perfectly. gonna best beautiful wall anyone ever seen. really think people gonna like know, like gonna great think people going come look wonderful is.   Really testing rates lowest? scums everywhere. Xi smart enough listen experts - that's good leader supposed do!  Would even able make statistically meaningful blip baseline level violence already raging US? Glad see Hundreds? 

You mean hundreds thousands, think. dumbest thing I've read today. hate yourself? policy-making epidemiological data-gathering body. work local-level public health organizations help organize global, coordinated responses public health crises—like one that’s happening right now.

I’m going guess comment you’re probably young remember either polio smallpox widespread crisis, role played. Like not, global society infectious diseases like impact us all. Asking “to average American citizen, gained?”, wrong question. Global information collection sharing means (the universal we) act concert respond health crises. receive benefits local leadership properly informed resources able respond appropriately crisis. alternative is, well, now, leadership didn’t respond appropriately. loss? You’re already feeling it. Yes CDC NIH, probably weather it, don’t benefit kind global scale.

If want look region, website btw: Almost literally deal, though work related different field. frustrating. They're right. Look numbers. California Arizona reported nothing weekend, bam, two biggest contributors today. Wait wait wait.. one second arguing Florida cooking numbers lying... argument going 1% infected? route taking? votes people like him? live MD see almost everyone mask stores - sure VA care. supposedly mandate too. noticed thing Winchester couple weeks ago Hahahaha didn’t well high school don’t know proper acronym BC school automatically trash? 

You’re trash. fuck off. thinking same. watch trend next several days. soon know anything. quarantining putting people danger. Something got done.  Giving people freedom willfully things protect others enough anymore people give fuck anything. stop. Midwest US resident here. us are, idiots ones try get through. would say, barring emergencies regular commerce, keep closed next 9-12 months. Things calm then. Airlines start flyovers foreign places. clearly, doesn’t seem like much ever comes mind 😂 plan staying in-laws two weeks stays apartment. We’ve definitely thinking through, although might able come. since son turned two haven’t seen year, really hope can. Hence powerful form soft power Far safer India!

Of course, going engage separatist terrorist behavior, State always respond force. 

Assuming American, tell us, peacefully United States respond half country decided secede? terrorists struck New York, US nothing? think possible get away nobody infected. we'd jumped initial contacts ""over-reacted"" might shot least changing exponential nature certain areas. even believe necessity shut public life protect people. 

From beginning, needed better education, better leadership, better coordination. one thing nobody could provided needed compassion. 

I believe everybody taken seriously, seen civic responsibility spread it, wore mask anytime left house, avoided crowded situations would looking markedly different result. Certain business models bars movie theaters might led infection anyways needed shutting adapting (carhop style alcohol service example). 

The approach ""let's get get with"" short-sighted guarantee pay years decades now. even know herd immunity thing yet. know secondary effects drain workforce healthcare system. know. 

We least committed reducing transmission right find solution, might saved lot suffering. care that, might save lot resources logistical standpoint lot healthy workforce. slander lord savior JPow, patron saint money printers, kinds words /s  pay moat militarized beavers well. somebody trump starts talking like this, sounds like child.

I build BIGGEST BEST Sensors alien pass borders.

(while says grounds sensors likely know Intel conversation stay secret.) Great. Well guess we’ll adjust Whatcom County Washington State need bartender crack beer open, hell supposed open thing myself? rate tracking, infect fully 1% entire population US

By when? saying already has? 

Not trying smartass, want know saying here. using beer pong rules. Manitoba? We've hit softly want USA Canada Manitoba. chance first place people scared ""socialist"" gillum still controversy voting. 

But thank God got Rick Scott Senate amazing run governor! work everyone else that? Nothing comes mind moment. Tiger King taught us anything, person 100% bear pet. Im american definitely think stay close keep freedom here, (studdering) corona virus ahem. Pretty sure involve stopping lunch way going Walmart after. tried argue that. problem argument fact means Disney Universal safe open. remaining 19% Canadian Karens want cross border tax free shopping US. Austin setting convention center overflow  I've observed, matter disease long death. matter findings throw masses, matter what, always respond:

""bUT mORTaLiTy RaTE"" sister quit job Publix reason! know she’s smart dad prodded hopefully they’ll okay :) That's kinda misleading show testing numbers all. know that's reason cases going now, personally believe cases much higher back March.

Edit: still expect deaths increase, IMO think get back April death numbers cases go much higher. average person reacting. even think numb right word think/feel much before. just...ignorant, apathetic, wanting move life mostly ignoring covid exists. supporters one political side people certain neighborhoods/cities. places like work stores people even mention Covid. Well definitely find would thought actually ever heard messages anyone leaves office someone big enough bank account.  checked overall death rate since April 4%.

Uh, checking? source accounting cases confirmed?

Last checked around 1%, less. advice? mayor takes comfort making headlines please constituents rather establishing enforcing policy. Furthermore, CA governor given counties transitioned policy try minimize short term economic impact instead ending virus. may view CA/Los Angeles liberal just, different FL TX political status outweighs safety people. What's difference? measles virus float air own? long measles stay air for? fall ground? Kiss baby goodbye leave. Anecdotal evidence bone pain makes worried infects marrow blood cell production.  look state state data, see biggest contributors jump (California Arizona) went reporting total 2% total deaths US Saturday Sunday, 25% today. That's two significant. others. backlog. think nicotine reaches much deeper person realize. like said, can’t assume always tough think. anyone immediate family member Canadian citizen permanent resident, yes. believe president says hoax, real, ignore fake numbers go back work, gone Friday.. bad regular flu, Besides affects small percentage old people.

Why would lie... declining death rate ended today seems. California least, cases started rise third week June. it'll take while.

What watch ICU, deaths come from. ICU usage goes up, deaths increase after. come it’s over. Imo, could never trust country again, allows leaders even fellow citizens blatantly disregard safety countrymen.

We tenth population, large land mass. could use people fill it! extremely partisan FB friend sent link I've seen discussion anywhere. 


This guy seems saying stuff certain groups saying months. 


  


Is worth discussion analysis? Oh no, know better rely completely. long conversation many risk factors consider. clear instructions call. She’s straightforward thought would hurt, she’d say so. 

For it’s worth, decent idea SP02 multiple circumstances never ending MD appointments multi-day hospitalization. Documented medical records. never 95%. symptoms covid shortness breath reading 95%, that’s alarm bell. 

And always forever—if shortness breath, without covid, seek medical attention ASAP. Totally understandable, long recognize quarantine plan becomes quarantine plan contact her. 

Plan ahead 2 weeks stay home 2 weeks! know family clear. 

Best wishes family, stay safe! backlog holiday weekend, people believe things want fits narrative. Please Put leave pay. isn’t arbitrary decision. Scientists experts saying we’ll save 35k lives November people wear masks.

Fuck making political issue, public health issue. I'm teacher go back month. work pay bills take care family.  I'm thinking need giant life insurance policy probably give one include COVID. Oh well, think I'll get Breaking Bad Hazmat suit chemistry demos (I teach science). met Mississippi? don’t know i’m going now. quit reddit Anywhere people flew risk.

Turkmenistan remote sparse, almost outside contact. surprise all. Nope. something 130k died far nothing compared death toll fall/winter. American: agree stay closed Canada’s safety! Nearly every death underlying condition. one knows would keil already anyways. Some? Course. People die everyday random shit.

Time tell impact, getting sensational excel 101 charting tools trying predict human behavior fucking comical.

Fuck them. one right put others danger. highly unlikely fan zombies. ppl getting ill like running healthy places brainz threat hospitals lie greater good. lockdowns also helped play low risk everyone home. 

you realize sometimes lie important truth. case, saved thousands lives - specific - thousands frontline healthcare workers lives.

If die off, aint nobody gonna treat us plebes means fucked....  be, unfortunately rest Republican party decided are. That's case since John McCain Robert Mueller hung dry liberals. see Trump resigning get Pence pardon federal crimes, jumping ship Russia avoid New York crimes Seems pointless slowing spread, it’s inevitably going hit everyone anyways. husband radiologist. says Covid positive asymptomatic patients still clots lungs, possibly damage organs I.e. brain inflammation. don’t want get 20s carry O2 tank around you’re 40 possibly develop Parkinson’s. scary thought. Oh $4185? That’ll afford half month tuition Harvard would handle sheriffs saying enforce mandates? Unfortunately containing disease really possible, even New Zealand can't completely get rid it, although managed get low level life go completely normally. countries good responses, still struggling contain it. USA Sweden, well, pandemic likely end enough people infected forces wishing ill upon American people President gladly playing along forces self-preservation.

No one Russia, China, Iran, Saudi Arabia, wants Americans wear masks. want weakened gasping breath. person lives here, hispanics so... Wearing mask reduces spread eliminate it. Somehow people gotten heads masks solve everything It’s shitty source. Try this: Exercise exhausting enjoyable. 

Learn dual wield emotions Wow man crisis actors funded soros getting sophisticated everyday. looks almost exactly like ICU. 

It's going devastating like NYC. truly feel brave professionals. Well, they're not. Could actual citizen? India's lockdown start around early April. thing seems shown countries December January.

Worse yet, also means ICU beds unforeseen tragedy longer available. food mediocre reheated Sysco products, dunno anyone would miss homecooking. true.






Sorry. racist want prevent citizens hellhole america infect anyone sight. Yup. tomorrow. think understand science works.  American think it’s fine. Like.. right recently?

No, friend failing cope desperately reaching reassurance kidding, near Houston seeing action taken governor terrifying.  $49650 Oh, sorry, think mixed threads. get now, though I'm assuming Canadian... could Mexican... 100k *confirmed* deaths third year translates 300k annually assuming constant rate terribly optimistic.

It's called Federal Government! moved FL CO almost 4 years ago, never looking back. describing situation hot wars commonplace. Apart reasons argued here, **really, really bad idea** waive sovereign immunity allow state sued damages world originate within state. US would sued bankruptcy. allow retroactive applications would possibly required here, European nations. Governor could withhold state funds police departments comply. Really hard people wear masks, dunno issue. Massachusetts already population die Coronavirus (10x Texas). able open successfully, shows herd immunity obtainable suggesting. think possibility based see Sweeden, could also see social distancing becoming lax cases starting balloon again. We'll see... Minneapolis tested large sample people protests positive test rate like 1%. Probably best tree barking up. question becomes notice hit China? less virulent earlier forms mutated early case jumped someone going Wuhan? miss crazy outbreak little villages worldwide misidentify particularly bad pneumonia? It'll certainly interesting history study past nightmare right now. Gyms open San Mateo County right next door. ridiculous. Yeah kind remind Brown Shirts. part mass saying that.

In fact, there's lot people thread part mass responding responsibly intelligently. forget we're part group influence simply actions example. representatives reflect people vote them. Definitely see happening. government told us safe reopen, mean safe reopen? understand. would politicians lie people? I'll damned Jim. They're producing 3 billion September, Astra Serum Institute. That's fucking revolutionary. We're way past thousands now. pushed reopen, federal governments fault massive outbreak, right.... need make magnetic signs ""I've quarantined 14 days, attack"" ""I'm Canadian US car, pls hate"". point losing popular vote stop someone winning electoral college? Monday, VA recorded total 24,942 cases virus, 18,240 considered ""convalescent,"" meaning patients recovered least 14 days since tested positive. 

The 24,942 cases represent 7 percent 338,109 COVID-19 tests VA says administered nationwide, though unclear total number unique tests total tests overall. 

At least 1,693 VA patients died the virus, the department reported, death rate 8 percent, higher 5 percent death rate virus cases among Americans, according data Centers Disease Control Prevention.

Among department employees, 2,510 have tested positive 40 employees died fast-spreading virus. Employee cases deaths also continued increase past month we're trying new record. That's population wide polls work. [See previous quite dumb, you. bother trying reasonable shit. use US cheaper gas. that, give fuck them. said, im also 81%.

Theres 3 instead 2 day backlog weekend. could see angle anything besides ""party"" could probably seen intent. exposed huge risk let nature take course may found pretty easily done nothing her.

But seeked medical attention absolve appears initial intent. expose immune-compromised individual SARS-CoV-2 chance surviving COVID-19, contract it, decreases greatly otherwise healthy person. medical profession way, would known simple fact. Forget co-morbidities underlying conditions even COVID itself. Intentionally exposing immune-compromised individual *any* virus is, me, murder 1 person passes. realise drive Canada US plated car, lol. husband American, we've done exact thing importing car instance. husband lived Canada since 2007 still US car while. import process take months.

End discussion. about. Origin research usually take years, preventing future pandemics. Nothing comes origin research would help current pandemic. No, thank you! Donald J Trump suspending immigrants entering US Yeah, long careful responsible, really hope reunited well!

But take seriously. Everybody thinks ""oh, one thing matter..."" ""one thing matter"" done 10 times absolutely cost someone life. Jesus Christ. sf also first city quarantine... plan involves people putting life indefinite hold virus, absolutely minscule death rate majority active population, really plan fail.

Plain simply, nobody could realistically expect happen.  Typical response someone opinion face facts masses: ""but get groceries?! need leave things!""

Ever heard grocery delivery? love guys. always immigrants make America great. What's plan indeed! :( response suggesting 2nd 3rd generation Asians racist. gave example that's true. Again, making black white statements. Good job. Exactly this. moment figuring began spread important stopping spread getting outbreaks control. determine fire arson put flames, building still burning. Never appreciated word much read 😁 insanity, I've proud BC. American here.

I agree. U.S. whole sucks right comes managing virus.

Don't let us infect you. likely, polite. 19% either 1) particularly stupid, 2) directly losing lot money result american tourism. Frankly I'm surprised 81% figure high is. modern canadian standards (or western standards general) 81% overwhelming blowout. Means majority left right wing actually agree something. rare controversial topic. Even good day get 81% canada agree colour shit. FYI import car Canada even US plates good till get inspections. could car months easily, quick judge. mean imported car California years ago thing could happened pandemic happened occur, lol. 19%? That’s real question, rationalization true. Joe Biden isn’t hated Hillary. live Az taken week family get test results back also write numbers differently, like 12,34,56,789 that's read (12 crore 34 lakh 56 thousand 789).

I'm Chinese wish we'd done same. write 123,456,789 read 1 亿 2345 万 6789 (in groups 4). always confuses brain : ( Every new day seems ready break previously set record new cases well new deaths. worrisome, specially parts seeing uncontrolled outbreak resurgence (may rise good fall).

Don't naive ignore masks. Please always wear going out. preventive therapy masks far effective imaginary vaccine whose news released pump market. Even vaccine comes months later, many priceless lives would've lost absence masks then.  Racists got beat. East Van saw car Mexican plates it! Well setup gofundme celebrate life. counts right? /s stupidity astonishing. welcome! really quite negative here. People around globe working day night find effective treatments. hope therapeutics vaccines sooner rather later. cares stock market goes MAGA red Sorry hear that, stupid thing lose people over. I'm independent, hold allegiance scrutinized... frustrating time. little 8 million people live NYC. means 2 million infected. See, Disaster Economics ""The Shock Doctrine"" Naomi Klein. worse. one said savior. fine long term GOP plans busy many unions possible (teachers especially) get private schools preference religious reasons(make public schools fail charter/private alternative seems better). kills people GOP don’t care. hundred hospitals lied capacity? different states different networks lied time? claiming massive fraud scale never seen, without shred proof.

Also, bothered slightest research, hospitals losing money here. often rebuked claim government paying inflate cases utter bull. Medicare sets reimbursement rate *every procedure*, major insurance companies follow rate. rate heart attacks, gunshot wounds, cancer, etc. simply rate insurance companies pay per procedure.

Hospitals make money elective surgeries procedures, cancelled months. profit healthcare system going collapse due this, jerkasses like spin wild conspiracy claims, interfere measures need take otherwise enable entire system pander pathetic need seem smarter business less important lives people communities operate Herd immunity works vaccine quickly get % up. That’s every often measles’s outbreak certain areas anti vaccine number drops spreads. Italy China announced yes, intention. intention actually create containment zone northern Italy Wuhan. Italian government made mistake giving people Northern Italy notice. going roadblocks going Austin. People need flee avoid lockdown. Part US' problem lockdown still free travel states never true containment zone. almost guidance came early pandemic knew little virus guidance updated accordingly new information comes out.

This passive aggressive bullshit helping ONE. USA cannot get clusterf#&amp;$ soon enough. I’ve got asthma, lung capacity lowered pretty severe pneumonia - absolutely issues wearing mask. trying stop generalization Americans another generalization Americans? Comical. one said generalization Americans. hit dog hollers. whenever 800 number, one area code pre-fix, one know- i'll answer mute call...from i've told- makes auto-dialer end read ""dead"" line, remove it. know true actually might be. yet another reason love man. daughter went school son man incredibly kind active kids lives. However, always made ass acting like teenage girl every time went house. Don’t tell anyone. told awaiting test result follow guidelines someone tested positive, going test. would reasonable someone told retest allowed go get retested.

*Not location question still... ChaChunk Unless school year virtual I'm supporting school education opening fall. would spread fast many people would dead. Imagine... Man terrible “Get covid-19” would actually send days know also probably take better care dog too. He's never caged here, fights.. go back go back work leaves restaurant workers problem. Either work catch virus shed virus everybody meet, work starve. remember yesterday March...and somehow overnight, graduated college. 150k active cases Arkansas would completely fucking destroy state tbh funny say that, half hellhole Americans. benefits member? imagine corporations could profited some, average American citizen gained? real loss felt this? border China? remember charge called hoax parents start dying. Great, let's compare trash trash.While SF, yes, done exceptionally well USA, still mean good, changing.

7-day average cases SF 49 today BC (where now) reported mere 12 cases compare, that's 49 cases 883k population vs. 12 cases 5M population. great. SF held curve \~80% peak value, never actually went daily cases.

Additionally, reported Francisco\] diagnosing 6.1 cases per 100,000 per day. goal keep number 1.8.  rate could overwhelm health care system cause many deaths don’t get handle right away,"" Colfax said. ""I need San Franciscans understand serious precarious situation is.""  people infected COVID-19 increased 25% past week. ""Our goal increase less 10%,"" Colfax said.  hospital capacity currently good, 35% acute beds 30% ICU beds available, Colfax concerned future. ""That could change time,"" said. ""We know virus takes off, takes fast.""  last 2 weeks SF reported cases daily avg + highest cases single day since pandemic began. reported today, open economy March shelter-in-place active. situation SF changing right now, data showing it. Since things lag record them, businesses open right (+ July 4th recently), foreseeable SF going break sanctuary lucky last 4 months.

There reason left country week ago. know tell you. link attached proves guy right wrong. Maybe edited it? big facts here, Nate Silver: expected, made low death tolls holiday weekend high one today; 919 highest death toll since June 3 (excluding day NJ changed reporting standards). However, combined Saturday-Tuesday numbers similar last week. 

That is, Sat.-Tues. last week, 1706 deaths reported, compared 1676 week. So, numbers today might expected given light reporting weekend. 

We heading 11th consecutive week declining deaths. reduced deaths country 90%. good news therefore prohibited sub. eagerly await downvotes. heard last days low death count now.. 

Magical thinking mass scale.

The virus didnt decide mutate benefit. thing mitigate much practice treating.

And if...big if...it stays heartier population...i.e. young people...

 otherwise zero evidence less deadly. Bringing time comment implies agree content wrong, think relevant changed mind since. Oh no. Noooooooo . might well live Canada.

Decent icy east coast skiing though new England. There's plus Cant get citation never get tested That’s one way kill coronavirus. that, injecting disinfectants, getting rid cases testing, he’s genius. outside box solutions Covid-19. already lying that? Swedes inviting American result...  fuck WHO's fault? Tuesday long weekend. Wednesday likely high well catch reporting it'll start come back long decreasing trend holds. seven day trend still decreasing. live near tourist area too, Crystal Coast / Southern Outer Banks North Carolina. Avoiding touristy areas like plague they've incredibly crowded generally speaking, people going vacation global pandemic think highly wearing face masks. 

That said, go grocery store today pleasantly surprised one person wearing mask. Give em ol' Donald Duck Actually, yes. Many argued protests spread virus. implication specific mass gatherings safe activity. **KNOW** fuckheads charge going let science &amp; COVID reality catch urges get peons return slaving them, right?

I'm sorry, want endless people die got decided indoor classes usual still good. awkward moment homicidal dictator concern people former leader free world. Dennis Rodman everyone else, there's re-education camps trying open even done first wave yet? Didn’t Tulsa’s outbreak start GE warehouse? Thank goodness cows don’t spread lol. Thank everything do, I’m sorry many people Dallas assholes masks precautions. don’t think people understand much care goes patients tough virus  Well, comments don’t lose charm! course would worth it. take small temporary dip essentially eliminate competitors? least hurt them. Besides, big Daddy Trump given bailout money big corporations, fine. stimulus funds injected economy, citizens accounted something like 5% it. rest government corporations. (And companies still furloughed employees) Oh neighbors north, blame you. getting facts from. 

We aren’t even close running directly contributed higher death rate. Oxygen shown better treatment most. No, comment mine blamed Fauci’s incompetence trump. 

Also last week media reporting potential swine flu coming past couple days it’s mutations Covid-19 explain differences confirmed cases state state. point solid facts reported deaths. &lt;insert canned brand link? capability round forcibly vaccinate antivaxxers. combined resources Google, Facebook, Amazon, major ISPs federal government could start building lists start knocking doors. Tackle Karen, plant knee head vaccinate living room floor. TLDR: 7 new imported cases, 0 new domestic cases, 6 new asymptomatic carrier

Americans deserve even more-ridicule American here, hard feelings. I'd close border us too. r/agedlikemilk They’re people I’ve spent time with, thankfully foresight behave responsibly feel bad even saw potentially exposed them. tested tomorrow. Thank well wishes! Props insurance agency firing top salesman. could see lot places reluctant let top money maker go probably raging asshole work Testing also better now. lot people NY/NJ died even get test kept getting turned away...this meant treated quickly things took turn worse. What's saying?

Play stupid games... forget rest, anyone got it? Haha, no. need wait amount time know that's bullshit conspiracy theory nonsense. That's makes ironic. Army commercial air strike—I literally thought game end. Gross. Nooooo go institution like Harvard online classes. World renowned leaders professors, rubbing elbows top experts industry, attending significant resume boosting activities, chance working best labs money buy. Ain't nobody paying Harvard level tuition getting that. 

Harvard exclusive can't accommodate students, they're elite fuck. institutional blowback imagine decision insignificant. Beautiful people We’re talking summer. We’re talking schools open. normal summer, summer camps, daycare, families go vacations, family members (grandparents) help none options work. options think going table fall? Lol says 6090 website. deaths correct. Tulsa OKC. significant outbreaks counties tied meat processing plants. counties low counts cases due sparse population. Cows spread it. Yeah wife nurse sharp met graduating class there’s wide variety intelligence job.  

Some go medicine mission, money. flat bullshit is. people consumed narrative seem support consistent political agenda. shit even get NK first place ha ent Reddit long you. Reddit magnet people talk confidently expert. Like me. comment Fluffy said. “Went nice secluded cabin Colorado past weekend. hard pressed find anyone wearing mask.“ curious Colorado was. Masks popular urban areas much rural mountain towns. Australia far critical China. many countries. media tends focus heavily anything US-related. sas government response? last heard they’re bungling it. Sorry long link breakdown, might here.  can't really compare South Korea US. starters, South Korea virtually island since terrestrial movement South Korea country.

Second, much homogeneous country puts societal cohesion individualism. much likely listen follow instructions government Americans.

Finally, smaller dense country. one hand lead greater infection rate fixed area, advantage population pretty limited geographic movement, meaning harder spread outbreak one region another. Unlike US person Iowa go vacation Florida bring COVID back Iowa. NY made couple really bad decisions too:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Cuomo allowing infected patients go back nursing homes (that huge amount deaths).
2. Putting people vents way fast...we know really go solution.

&amp;#x200B;

I doubt numbers get high Texas unless hospitals become overrun people die can't get treatment, period. Shh ruin narrative. Deaths look jumping throughout country Flu probably least effective vaccine have. It’s anywhere [24%-63% childhood vaccines measles 85% effective. 75% effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccine would pretty great. Probably dumb question could wearing multiple masks help protect more? run store today wore medical mask (not respirator one) cloth mask filter it. overkill? They're ones say ""womp womp"" told innocent children shoved cages separated families.

There people lack empathy really consider part society. send island let live like animals want be. I'll back check then. Thanks prediction. That’s person feels trapped situation though… deaths near plateau daily virus cases increasing? expecting people suddenly stop dying it? I’m grateful I’ve actually taken seriously, people I’ve spent time parents. ortho’s office hadn’t done right thing notified patients positive test would never thought it! don’t feel sick anymore least I’m comfortable won't. bodies start piling up, people stay home regardless whether lockdown ordered. Businesses lose money staying open customers closed  Yeah, bad example going say something similar post. People stupid long time lot things.  **should** forced pay kind reparations international community pandemic. 

Good luck latest series coronaviruses emerged China last 17 years. 

China country outbreaks. Make list countries, rank outbreaks, make country top list pay, get China talk would argue CCP isn’t enough limit export diseases abroad. 

Which country think exported cases Covid-19 abroad? guarantee China. China locked down. Meanwhile, country cases still nationwide lockdown one enough. already know multiple countries got cases USA, China let hook. need pay up. 

When irrefutable evidence China origin, irrefutable evidence China covered up, irrefutable evidence China purposely exported virus abroad go gather allies demand China pay up. happens, getting paid. 2 weeks. even 2 days, it’s still lie. lying media. said human human whole time*

Stop spreading bullshit. try pulling exact tweet stating ""there currently evidence H2H"" back early Jan ACTUAL EVIDENCE CAME OUT. words hardly apply either, body responsible guiding world's response pandemic, addition refusing admit pandemic, created confusion human human transmission, advocated travel restrictions, advised countries China stockpile PPE, advocated general mask use, issued misleading information asymptomatic transmission, airborne transmission, failed exert pressure China produce accurate timely information, allow independent international access outbreak site. hard imagine dismal failure, world relying most.

They lost authority, stand discredited. point country providing funding. Wiley online library research articles asymptomatic transmissions - searchable:
onlinelibrary.wiley.com 2k LA. (2k backlog). 

OC literally higher per capita. mean people say 1k 5k, means 1,000 5,000 respectively. Crazy given bold CA outset proactive shut-down places weren't. letting get 200 cases first place. trace everyone ensure obey quarantine make sure importing cases, that's let restrictions up. Hopefully mask said wide open mouth strib clubs still open? ""cuz wanna, nanana booboo smell poo"" -Desantis thought would provide updates; need beating up. Im Bay Area. I'm fitness industry independent coach. live gyms everywhere open essentially minimum necessary guidelines really zero accounting fact airborne virus circulates indoors. We're asking trouble...but right feels quiet we're LA. Im wondering soon hear local gym outbreak gym members really trainers coaches wear masks. Denial air conditioning. admitted could anywhere 20 100 times

Care share source that? I've heard generally cases 5-10x catching. Gottlieb said 20x, maybe article two, 100x seen aside here. think misunderstand phrase rhetoric general please something else We're going get tragedy cannot ignored

What pisses people arguing will, five ten years, proudly lying wore masks along Yay!! mean...boo...?! US leaders even pretend charge anymore  demand astronomical, healthcare US alone need 3.5 billion N95 masks total production like 2 billion across world. (has increased since still far shorter demand). counts US healthcare, including essential workers, general public countries. 


I read analysis PPE shortage back Feb, bought PAPR work EMS. First, I'm deleting posts discussing, want give irritating twits pleasure downvoting 15 times original post, courtesy little discussion. Feel free continue quoting replies like, actually appreciate that.

Second, predatory lending, despicable, exists idiots made poor choices led point needing hand full cash insanely high rates. refuse consider evidence systemic financial inequality matter pure choice. Anyone take one crappy loans ALWAYS alternatives, even person unaware never brought criminal immunity

THAT whole thread about. OP stated repeatedly well financially brings person privilege, completely untrue. privilege would lead immunity criminal consequences listed OP. Rich people still deal consequences I, given fine structure used CJ system tends flat, means whole helluva lot less rich person poor person...but privilege caused that. damned effect seen mentally insane person cannot consider consequences actions...so make person manic bipolar disorder privileged? consequences would bother would person easily pay fine...after all.

Lastly, I'll give one response head night, make good. Well sometime, fun! went university's health center back spasm. person checking said ""Are always tense?"" replied ""Only I'm much pain."" live high rise building people take masks soon enter lobby. Well, people actually wear all, is.""Home sweet home, mask :)."" 

I guess COVID can't exist apartment buildings, get memo. I’m going back Target butcher tomorrow. ready initial hit back March, always buy dry goods sale stockpile. (I buy 2 family houses, including one summer vacation home, stock winter sales)

I feeling 2 weeks people going buy TP meat again. I’m wrong, whatever, paper doesn’t go bad, chest freezer meat bread. even became expert pickling, freezer mirepoix, freezing fresh herbs ice trays initial wave pandemic. (Hobbies already cultivating cooking household 3). 

Here go again! Get shit together. people calling hoax going crying, again. imagine short lines rides! Edit - also hell downvoted? You’re reciting facts regarding critical distinctions.

I know, silly. sub. imply US good job get downvoted. silly, think US terrible job state opposite. point silly compare US ""island"" nation different philosophy society vs. individual.

For reason, something sub like - compare US South Korea. New Zealand. Taiwan. Iceland. Lol. dad P.A. system? Sorry, thinking woman climbed fence. 

Obviously, NZ strict China countries, sorts issues. Enforcement penalties least show they're serious punishment prevention. guy says [we're know enough underlying statistics opinion one way another. like protesting seatbelts cars... stop elective surgeries. non-COVID hospitals set electives procedures take place - COVID hospitals - competent leadership could made happen. people can't comprehend two death rates.

The rate death receiving medical treatment 

The rate death 0 medical treatment hospitals maxed triage. want Canadians here, want Americans going Canada, reason. spread fucking thing longer going problem. way state borders US would closed too, we'd still shelter place. summarize, we're North American continent, disease care borders. free travel, what's bad Canada bad us, vice versa. grew Assembly God church pretty fucking batshit crazy. shit sherlock. Trash tier organization always 20 years behind everyone else. abolish already. American here, keep us away. turned pandemic opinion, means display selfish laziness, fear/conspiracy campaign, everything except situation take seriously. country rot one else pay price, freeze learn. anyways position first place never contained never controlled much likely die car accident. 

Not right now. country banned entering Mexico, Canada Europe. got protests every major city. lead world cases deaths. 

And somehow adds ""good place"". 

I'd hate see qualifies ""bad place"" trumps mind.  Hey Canada, wrong. I'd building fucking wall right now. average redditor need better border controls. speak soon! think much numbers purposefully hidden USA. Public health mostly handled local level certainly areas want keep numbers low conspiracy.

We exactly known health US, surprised lot excess deaths secondary. Meaning people die covid put treatment going ED died previously controlled chronic condition. Absolutely agree. Look fools. Democrats Republicans office decade, decades...and voters KEEP voting asses in. think politicians side, aren’t. all. Good luck collecting telling 19% countrymen daft. Holy shit, agree go office people charge safety morons? boss made comment everyone go sun since kills virus, wanted punch computer. I'm planning resist going office time since cases starting rise get work done without going office. want us back next week. We'll see long find acceptable least know I'm valuable enough they'd work around it, me. I’m pretty sure 100% Canadians don’t want USA coming here, done well handling don’t need USA fucking up. Sounds like trying achieve outcome got. suppose prefer US addicted rage quitting aka sanctioning international court investigating us war crimes Afghanistan Stop ignorant want opinions this. Go look many states currently experiencing exponential growth Trump playing 5D Chess, he's trying Chinese Checkers board using pieces Monopoly Battleship. Yup. it. Good looking out. automatically buckle in. cars alarms alert driver unbuckled occupant, simple fix... Unplug it. admit comment made laugh. don’t know many people would rather face boss dog. Hehe ;) I’m San Bernardino County. Everyone see wears mask. go grocery store post office every single person wears mask. town live bars opened briefly closed protests. Guess what? cases rising anyway. 600 new cases county overnight three deaths. even read post replied to, moron? Fu bot. Ill give good odds muslim immigrants also charged cost deep clean Countdown idiot Honest god whole fucking country death wish. Combined recent estimates need 85 95% mask compliance get thing control, indeed sad. Yea really breaking news anything.

I'd prefer people US stay damn state. people countries stay fucking US.

How everyone stays home, can't people handle visiting somewhere year? Drive around place lick people. can’t build wall. I’m fine using taxes that! Merci fill ghost beds claiming right now. Also downtown Van here. Lots Washington plates apartment building visitors parking last while. Hoping it’s people coming home family considering many different cars I’ve seen, it’s concerning. Please stop stay place possible. Check prenatal choline schizophrenia prevention. always easy that. quit job places file complaint abandonment places board side employer yank license meaning never able work field again. goes training, experience ability work. I'd take hurricanes tornadoes lived areas both. thing hurricanes though intense uncertainty entire time damn thing go. Could devastating nothing, depends pressure front moves last bit. entire time plan worst, debate evac, buy supplies (which complete shitshow), that. Given situation America right now, hard blame them. corporate elites. Fucking universities said racism white kids. They're expected man pretend feel kind insults. expected white kid non-white neighbourhood subject racism somehow feel it. Perfectly fine Muslim China. heard Xi'an Muslim Market that's around thousand years? many mosques China around hundreds years. China Islam long history dating back Silk Road, know goes Islamic World. also predicted got tons downvotes. obvious country packed like India would experience nightmare covid. sister gave birth 2 weeks ago, brother law could birth could visit son wife due coronavirus sure sucked. drove hospital everyday could least see (my sister stood Window) talking Phone. guess mean many tests done many people covid actually found positive - even asymptotic cases due contact tracing

Edit: New York least. states may testing / tracing  Hope things look soon. Find something grateful for. re-entry ones things go shut rewind partially fully needed. province’s reopening stages were/are tied reduction stability hospitalization rates ICU occupancy. Currently 54 6 respectively; latter 10 month +. Areas delayed moving next stage downgraded one stages due localized outbreaks, etc. want Canadians here, want Americans going Canada, reason. spread fucking thing longer going problem. way state borders would closed too, we'd still shelter place. summarize, we're North American continent, disease care borders. free travel, what's bad Canada bad us, vice versa. Yeah, think that's probably true. Even worked perfectly protect old people, number cases outside nursing homes shockingly high, overloading hospitals real concern. ""Put lot resources toward protecting old people"" good approach, matched areas. I'm glad Canada closing boarders. country USA get lot worse. Since Trumpet wants schools opened ASAP. Like WTF.

I bet we'll 10 million cases November. Plus another 3 end year. probably right. can't see ""benefit."" know least 132,000 dead disease  Everyday still Saturday. rules anymore. love you. honestly gonna devolve populism fascism. sadly states fucked, they're gonna drag whole world still used.  point need consider locking people least putting house arrest.  made clear cooperate circumstances danger everyone around them.  Nothing fight virus ever going matter issue resolved all. Like, car built 80s go pretty extreme measures wear seat belt, right? mean, sitting seat puts seatbelt you, right? somehow manage squirrel vehicle alerts loudly, right? us try.... turn America giant pile hot dog shit immigration pretty much stop own. True genius. good know wonder percentage Come on, post much less dumber Sweden’s approach virus. Elected, sure, run unopposed cause let's real, last time voted sheriff even know name? Assuming American Holocaust reference didn’t go well idiot Kansas said sure guy thinks it’s ok compare execution millions putting stupid piece fabric face.

I yet see someone hauled gas chamber wearing mask. Ripped away homes loaded onto trains shoved living hell waiting die. Yeah sorry dirty looks feel bad remotely close.

As Americans honestly think don’t really understand true horror Holocaust. people wouldn’t stupid make kinds statements. (Not so) funny part can't tell talking Florida's governor Dr. here. This, think Biden 47th President Pence William Henry Harrison length President pull Ford pardon boss I’m thinking use days front. feel diarrhea coming on. It’s legit symptom supply proof of. New teachers screwed. I’d trust Oxford one, experience vaccines working one years, tweaked little adapt new virus like we’ve always done flu vaccines. timeline similar would trust it. risk? Yes, research isn’t seems promising statements always assume lot virus area. low virus states yes - go right ahead open schools.

In states lot virus floating around? wants kid ""small percentage""? There's something wrong system allows top official leave seats government someone will. niave think problem stem people. Trump latest face something much worse. research Oxford (I think) said they're able save 80% people beginning, hopefully numbers go ballistic even insane amount new infections. Hmm, almost like people power priorities outrank health general population.. Honestly though feel like virus changed. 5 people know tested positive worse stopped nose. 10 years reach herd immunity! latest statistic saw top 10% wealth 84% stock market. gallop poll year determined 55% Americans stock. right percentages, it’s pretty safe say less 50% Americans sort appreciable amount stock. I'm 45, 6 years apart, ""new"" generation..... need wall... Keep filthy 'mericans out. Oh irony Mexico ends building wall. wow, took two hours? Tell business owners hung with? tell hearsay knowledge better first-hand knowledge? relaxation lockdown. spike seems directly connected easing lockdown. neediest public school students certainly ain't Cali

I mean, went school trailer socal 60% latino classmates teachers buy supplies. everywhere CA rich dude... stealthy ancestor COVID-19 already widespread across globe would bad news, unless rooted could evolve new pandemic time anywhere. Lol okay....whatever fuck means.

Look CDC test criteria believe me. Everyone grandma knows laws passed congress must comply constitution job supreme court simply interpret this.

DOMA fell foul 4th 14th Amendments stated "" person shall deprived life, liberty, property, without due process law. ""

Marriage already regarded fundamental right (the life, liberty) since earlier supreme court struck ban interracial marriages 1967. submarines? moved back States US license plates. slightly worried people getting wrong idea looking license plates. :( terrorists though? didn’t realize millions Uighurs terrorists. don’t think US re-education camps. Anyways back original point, countries bad isn’t pissing contest. accept - China bad place like US different reasons. Tom Hanks gave us info? Definitelym saying give chase herd immunity. I'm saying fight like hell keep hospitals overwhelmed even places screwed bad. Quite likely unless vaccine available. Even vaccine available may take 5-6 months available, year everyone get vaccinated. Even may people refusing get vaccinated together 🤷‍♀️ ask vote.
I vote seal shut. 
🇨🇦 Thanks eh. including biggest one: make money wrong! Sweet revenge called 大鼻子 time little kid. :D

(Westerner grew SE Asia) heard guy named Joe going peel Orange day. miss play vids people USA, completely unaware western allies little respect country moment “do look like light top mountain”.

They felt bad, explained why. Trump called us National Threat, never see country loooong time. :( It’s actually 4 times population. 1.35B population. probably weird artifact one random FL county. yeah fuck us question could “is sky blue?” least one province would say no, province hate said yes. Damn. move daughter apartment UCSD 3 weeks. screwed.  ""Attorney General Xavier Becerra filed suit Tuesday U.S. Department Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, alleging rule violated Congress’ intent would unlawfully divert tens millions dollars away neediest public school students.""

The neediest public school students certainly ain't Cali. STFU I'm one 10/50, gut tells they're fabricating numbers. protests, bar-going, gym-going, dining out. Pretty much everyone know taking sufficient precautions..

Yeah, right, numbers going down. totally believe Mr. Hogan. Pat back. think - can't increase capacity. machine need available 'til August major backlog right now. India saw trend we've seen countries- extremely slow start, started accelerate quickly, resulting explosive exponential growth. Even NYC cases reported quite bit exploded cases.

Many us hopeful India might see different story, look like it.

And, federal government nothing, states did, still, measures place. essentially 3 month shelter place. brain Elon Musk's twitter ...That's... lot people actually. Possibly. Although 2 exceptions think soft power USA.

1: USA primary English speaking country world significant presence. monopoly people understanding English beneficial them.

2: English common language means benefits occur country. arrangement French business German business occurs, reasonable arrangement (Or certainly parts it) could conducted English. tangible benefit USA arrangement conducted English. It’s crazy little Americans know anything desean jackson suck...  freeze milk. Scientists doubting right now. Virus found sewage system globally virus traced back November. 

If virus originate China, would super tough pill west swallow. one even raised alarm possible new virus circulating among public. Even wuhan happened, medical professionals west think it’s Asian thing, includes dr fauci. passed 1m tests today state 6.3m people... Pretty amazing. nah, depressed etc such, Huh, never realized. word starts *doo* end *mer* autoban now. Explains seen stupid comments around anymore. used get downvoted suggesting word autobanned, lol Another Utah here. crazy people keep saying vote mail hurts Republicans even though Utah primarily vote mail almost decade still Ruby Red. love voting system read downballot candidates I'm voting  Apparently herd immunity likewise impossible, maybe strive keep hospitals less 100% full. alive. well. .... no. Typical GOP leadership! dont need hospitals, God protect enjoy better better everyday, issues though! Lots nice countries Europe and. Nee Zealand looks amazing well. *People Florida going banned long time* 

^ftfy hospitals full already full covid hit. need tested positive labelled covid death. die hospital gunshot wound, happened get covid there, labelled covid death . died pneumonia, considered covid death. Hospitals get paid list patients covid Time build ocean city? Start floating trash island, give head start??? Florida governor commission study? I'm surprised 81. guys need sort shit out. Yikes say source lmao vaccines ready proved safe effective, thousands vaccinations going minute around globe. We'll hundreds millions one month mark. couldn’t said better point positive number found say.. past month small fraction total positive number found NY since march. 8% stayed relatively unchanged. change regardless much try test NY now, unless positives start drastically going again.

The death rate 8% back small fraction cases found. hear antibody tests showed around 20% NYC folks got infected one point, since recovered. many people that? compare actual positive count found? That's people still saying ""true"" death rate 1%.

To expand another example, many EU countries experienced recorded mortality rate based case found vs deaths. antibody testing, true mortality rate fell &lt;1%. 

In case, mortality rate significantly separated based age groups certain 'pre-existing conditions'. knew icebergs could complicated? Every one taking lightly, that’s BS. comment. full time care taker elderly mother I’m scared bring home her. generalization sucks governor idiot. point using weekly averages candles. makes tracking lot consistent. clearly see highest numbers always days week lowest numbers also always day. silly go go day day.

That said, number probably bit context definitely moving wrong direction. thing Yep. Exactly right. believe humidity factor though. next humudity higher areas. Hey, bot? Personally, support decline American hegemony. don’t think American empire good world.  Yeah shit, CDC American organization. Obviously ones following guidelines. Literally every country version...

The ignorance painful. fair, new hospitalizations reported. case wondering, staggering 380 people hospitalized today. Two weeks ago 100 per day. yes, we’re playing little catch weekend, that’s still high. 

You’d think he’d want show hospitalizations get brag discharges. Austin know people went mild cases covid-negative family members want infect home. Open border, take care you! I’ve several hospital stays Crohn’s surgeries (love username btw). Hard agree everything said. wondered ward would like, I’ve ever single roommates couple awful experiences that. feel like people around would helped particular roommates, maybe not! 

I think you‘re right antimaskers respect it’s like sick hospitalized. And, clearly, imagination empathy. It’s really depressing.

Believe not, innate form locomotion take quite virus hitchhike lung lung way market stall central China corner convenience store rural flyover country. travelling salesman problem. person face though, sure get lungs too. Sounds right, sad see honestly.  many go approve disapprove remain Republicans? hunch 90% shrinking group. one hand, fuck Disney? fuck people going Disney? See problem best ICU counting world, count ICU’s numbers look worse. said slow counting. ICU’s would stop filling stopped measuring many full! *Immunocompromised* teen girl attending *Covid party*? Holy shit! That's insane! I'm gonna honest. torn. one hand, want vaccine NOW. second find effective want first line primary care provider, waiting tent like concert tickets.

But sensible, sane, INFURIATINGLY self-aware part knows even proof long-term safety effectiveness, first jabs need go frontline workers. essential employees. WAAAAY list people need me. want pin hopes vaccine treatment might pan out. us fingers crossed Plaquenil, worked well. might extremely disappointing reasons organization working treatment might fudge numbers. 

The point bring ya down. point lot moving parts worth paying attention many positive developments possible, still string follow exit becomes clear. Oxford vaccine working out? That's great! Good news, flair says. that's story I'm following. Remdesivir seems effective palliative. corticosteroids fighting certain respiratory symptoms. Getting right treatment right collection symptoms box we're constantly unpacking - sometimes get wrong, Hydroxychloroquine, seems effective certain stages certain collections symptoms. 

Six months ago knew nothing virus. Imagine we'll know six months now. don’t government exile... yet. absolutely knows he’s going jail. That’s he’s trying hard sabotage investigations Goes show independents fools. Why.. would health insurance providers want pay hundreds thousands? would love ICU stays..  😘 927? better. Quarantines unconstitutional, implement [unconstitutional quarantine depending lot easier argue 14A issues back then. apologized, case.  said ""we going put _pressure_ open schools"". 

Pressure. Seems like appropriate term situation brother EMT Florida gets sick dies murderous public policy decisions asshole refuses listen public health experts, god help know do. known “God Gaps”. However, science nothing say God morality. It’s simply different question entirely superstition describe regarding floods, etc.

There many, many religious believers problem accepting conclusions science still worshipping God. belief two mutually exclusive wrong. I'm going say people fools, agree every else. Funny, that. 3 weeks since infection curve started going (back around June 15th). well u never really know u give try :) earlier day average 302. 7 day average declinimg sharply, 300 seem like terrible guess current run rate.

What's 3 Day average now? LOL It’s gyms restaurants... No, r/conservative that’s true v&amp; spamming, rule breaking, stirring s—t fun. 

With post, OP effectively riling everyone falls categories: Jealous, Scared, Racist, Angry, Impoverished, Doesn’t access mask, doesn’t believe masks, Western Religion extremists. Russian roulette making fun virus victims, would ever. sense humor ***some*** things helps us get through, even joke waistband printer. get filthy hands fucking idiot! US ignorant care people speaking out. Numbers still fudged too, least people trying get say things contrary government. Whereas China risk lowering social credit alienated everyone know speak government. Hey, least make good attack ads. say surge, nearly normal beds that's major yikes posted multiple times now. ~~ridiculous~~ hilarious

FTFY interesting. link studies found info from? Especially part numbers game. Would like see there's anything need consider personal anti-virus strategy. 'murica! Yeah shitting watching going Wuhan. Boss thought overdramatic started working home. 

Then week later made announcement Canada start shutting everything down. claim otherwise, claimed number tests per million same

The number tests per million means nothing. point test lot peaking. NYC higher deaths anywhere else even catching half cases peak. Belgium literally deaths per capita real country. think miss lot cases foolish. like another measure, US 6x tests/capita South Korea. country would say responded better missing cases? SK CFR 1.5% btw. guess I’m coupling heavy distancing. Ie places restricted gatherings 2 people max, 1 person per 10sqm similar restrictions simply closed businesses, churches, offices, etc - basically people full lockdown home masks become less necessary. would always advocate mask going supermarket, work indoors people, particularly lots virus present community.

Masks essential people mingling regularly. states “open.” people locked down, lock gets infection rates low enough, masks less essential, distancing (ie don’t see people (which increases risk touching surfaces etc)) overall powerful. Exactly Yeah, kind scary. Like, imagine parent essentially hearing 4-5 weeks school reopens state plans kids come classes. probably happen, given crazy country become ignorant Federal Government is, hell knows anymore. imagine handful parents might actually let kids go back especially surges continue FL coming month I'm sorry going type delay. wish well recovery goes swiftly next year better one. 

I moved another state receive care university/research hospital multiple conditions. I'm process seen skull-based tumor surgery. estimated would rise coronavirus cases July tried see doctors June, medical non-medical delays related virus prevented so. Now, I'm trying again, difficult. feel 95% sure people know they're wearing wrong way complying still able breathe/not comply. 20, fine. Go parties. Idiots... I'm sorry, say something tables turning? seeing that. looks like declining new cases past 49 days. different source shows number new cases per day antibody tests. False positives possible due tests sometimes showing positive residual anti body’s similar colds. rarely ever negative antibody tests occur. -my doctor. Trump press secretary proudly proclaims US world leader pandemic 🤦‍♀️ bunch count ""probably"" COVID deaths. Federal government power force mass production, man charge believes big deal.   Good. Give money organizations closer problem instead bunch academics flying 1st class staying 5 star hotels attend endless conferences. Absolutely fucking lol. declared millions freaked took way seriously. bad, announced everyone scared started taking seriously. Maybe done earlier people would waken took precautions lol. 

This always happens Chinese. want control everything realize bad is. I’ve got coworker leaving team tradition says get lunch celebrate/send off. really wants go large chain restaurant super disappointed us (disappointingly small minority) concerned. Thank goodness boss (who self-identifies someone ‘wants catch build immunity’) decided host socially distant restaurant-delivered meal training room instead. money goes workers, go read news takes longer that. 

It takes around two weeks death deaths reported official numbers. **6.4 million** unemployed people California.

If want stop businesses opening people going back work, suggest people?

The obvious answer federal stimulus, federal government insane can't count that. really think sororities lot better managing funds, promoting healthy bonds members chapter community, generally contribute world. That’s awesome done much! Trump lose election, I’m assuming next President could rip withdrawal since doesn’t go effect year now...? profit NYC it? went mostly unused. triple 7 considered unlucky Chinese culture? Japanese?  Absolutely. plenty food necessities home reason go tested tomorrow. Thank you! We're going get pardon Nixon again. guarantee it. one see sort justice. This. really hard everyone stupid. Anyone else annoyed articles never say many hospitals state whole?


I’m coronavirus conspiracy theorist lmao, think it’s kind absurd articles talking many Florida hospitals capacity don’t say many hospitals total. Seems pretty important understand severe is. Uh data supports this? bad get? Thanks! timeine sounds like locked even Italian ICUs overwhelmed, right? think schools opening like 3-4 weeks govt started paying ppl quarantine positve don’t like idea I’m sure people would stop spreading dam virus get money Sounds like responsible thing, loss smell strong predictor Covid symptom heavily overlap respiratory illnesses, certainly possible mild short case. helps, patients report start regain sense smell/taste within 2 weeks, almost completely recovered 2 months. Take care, get extra rest hydration, keep eye mental health isolation loss smell known increase risk depression. tried cover 2 weeks

They withheld making announcement good evidence. Like, test hospital result expected come two weeks, expect doctor call every hour two weeks tell nothing?  remember correctly, yesterday Newsom said LA 7000+ cases unreported needed added.

People report actually took time national holiday. Victoria massively multicultural prides woke. arguably left-leaning, socialist state country. Source: Victorian CA getting fucked previous cold weather keeping people inside north, current hot weather keeping people inside south. people traveling CA state absolutely fucked seen people basically said stay home vaccine. today, one guy said restaurants stay closed vaccine comes out. Definitely minority, exist. gonna say, St. Pete usually overun Canadians January February...as much shit talk America I'm sure I'll see winter make tips act like know 😂 hilarious It’s good thing Florida stopped reporting hospitalizations, otherwise would bad news Yeah, live work Japan. studied Japanese high school. always interest Asia.

BROOOO wear mask 😷 Blaming China useless. mean saw countries reacted afterwards. president literally said democratic hoax. months plan out. Can’t blame countries failures I’m sorry I’ve missed discussed. “essential” employee exposed/tests positive, sort standard business held to? going case case weigh importance business vs possible continued exposure? 

I coworkers come work exposure test small staff. illegal keep operating test positive, ethical issue? altogether still low risk long one symptoms? take epicenter death Northeast America, 3/4ths America par Canada

They wanted dead. explanation wanting life saving measures child dying? see exactly problem. agree need take every study objectively. I’m sure also know dangerous citing “science” lay person. Language research translate well language used news articles.

For example. said “smoking associated better covid outcomes”. faulty study cited didn’t say that. said smokers smaller percentage people hospitalized general public. would argue taking two covid patients, one smoker one not, smoker would absolutely worse outcome.

So saying makes lay person think “sweet smoking prevent dying covid”. That’s dangerous. That’s true. research backing up

Studies make specific claims. News articles bastardize language, lay people come around draw wrong conclusions. That’s true, numbers it’s looking quite bit lower weeks ago think weather important people realize. US, hotspots north, primarily New York, New Jersey, Chicago, Seattle. moved south. HVAC related? Pence last week meet DeSantis poured love government support DeSantis, praising opening state direction POTUS. Pence basically said Adios Amigo send ventilators PPE everyone Florida starts dying. knew Florida going disaster turning back now. worse become political rather public health. already explained reasoning concerned officially called pandemic would cause people give containing virus. Guess what? exactly happened soon declared pandemic. they’re up! Agree. Scary stuff happening US. That’s data looks like rolling 7 day average today. I’m expecting anything - probably rise. today observation slight decline flat. ""moving another country"" money. sure wish did.

LOL

If good experience, potential overseas employer pay least good portion moving costs.

Edit: reason move: special needs child. countries take good care child ya. douche. That’s even US survival rate. You’re making stuff up. Stop living denial. Senate taking vacation pandemic completed stimulus package help people really got skin. took vacation three weeks April. worked less three months get another 2 weeks get almost August I'm mistaken. can't believe can't get shit figured taking time off.... nerve call tax payers unemployment lazy. NATIVE AMERICANS.... holiday weekend delayed numbers.... Wait it’s Tuesday? Man I’m losing track days. virus going us years. OK admit likely reporting catch-up still think things go bad. Saw earlier, "" **U.S. coronavirus cases hit 3 million, stoking fears overwhelmed hospitals** "" 

Also came across info Texas hospitals capacity. sad day, Mexico closing border us start rationing health care like third world country.

But worry; DeSantis told stabilized 🤦‍♂️ God's plan, praaaaaaaaise Jaysus. point exactly!  DeSantis downplaying virus daily really helping. percent positive cases nearing 15 percent. Notice metro areas 2 million 3 25... basically even account population. 

We lot empty land vast majority Canadians live cities density cities Americans live in.  Every time cough like 10 times day probably Sorry, realize word allowed. Ok first all, Fed literally nothing whether federal stimulus given Americans. 

Second, majority Americans stocks bonds federal reserve unarguably helps common American extent. Unless zero retirement saved, securities. wonder actual death toll is? almost like people realised one things worth risk protest haircuts. 

Also first protests sitting initial exponential growth hospitals overloaded. second protests lock majority participants wearing masks. Imagine catching covid chili's 

Huge hospital bill damn generic Tex Mex. Embarrassing Yes know Ontario area majority tends spread least BC area minus Vancouver, Fraser health region borders united states far worst compared regions bc. keep hearing weekends numbers lower, new thing case whole time? I'm sure they'll hit New York levels, remember pretty large percentage people need hospitalization end dying. there'll almost certainly hundreds deaths day couple weeks current rate growth. Whether get control point real question. don’t care. don’t fucking care I'm sad, hate US. I'd love move Canada good. he's running unopposed. means Illinois suffer another 2 years. Thanks! videos taken down, dipshits made would make new videos they're ""censored"" Youtube.

I think Youtube Looney Tunes DVD releases containing racist cartoons 40s - warning racist cartoons cartoons racist stereotypes wanted warn people contain racism, instead censoring them. Youtube put warnings like videos saying: content video considered pseudoscientific, want censor anyone's content. reporting catching up. actual deaths much lower getting lower. There's really nothing worry about. fact, great time trip Disney World. /s China tested millions people found bunch asymptomatic cases. mini outbreak Beijing. small number cases per day, many returning travelers. What's wrong people. clearly said discuss treatment protocol doctor. mention 2 small scale studies one France world renowned Dr renauld (or something like ) 100% success rate treating 40 patients time. second similar size similar results Australia. read Trump even said anything them. assume read thing.

Yeah. fucked up. don’t understand Newsom caved opened quickly. understand economic motives, experts must surely known botched reopening would cause even greater economic turmoil.

This purely speculative, wonder Donald Trump Jr.’s girlfriend, Kimberly Guilfoye (Newsom’s ex-wife), played role convincing Newsom reopen. Trump praised Newsom lot press briefings, found bit surprising since California pretty quick challenge Trump’s initial well stance ... Florida even try respond.

The counties shut down, orders governor.

He ordered open said there's option shut back down, meanwhile highest new cases day world. higher state country ever had, ordered schools resume 5 day week person classes &amp; forbid counties closing back down.

We're running 12 day lag testing notification well, disney world opening back next week.

Mexico comparison south Korea level response. far right wing anti life governor decided we'll control group ""what nothing, also forced people go sit small room together""

Honestly extra money, I'd looking lot land investment Florida, hospitals overflowing death rate going spike.  patting China back whole time. Canada one highest unemployment rate, economically weak, bullied many nations... also making babies trying import... yes, lived thinking ""Canadian Dream"" came like rock skies Really good point!

Weird people power education now. Seeing it’s defunded much years First r/engrish. Second many far credible sources left right wing ""news"" sources worship. Wow. That's three states reporting cases par New York peak.....we also ~500 daily deaths peak, let's hope states get there... love good news post who’a article ends : *my strong advise, prepared worst*. Unless took context ... almost certainly illegal keep operating. well thats shocker /s lol 0 new domestic cases. Ok China. are, right knew we’d end up. basically think racist towards China OK?

That's argument right? saying yes, aerosol transmission definitely danger hospitals everyone wearing N95 masks. scientists trying argue fact, COVID-19 spreads via aerosol easier recommendation would suggest aerosol fact danger mundane environments too.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* You’re absolutely right. 

I personally can’t imagine waiting hours line get tested feel like complete shit. Ugh. subconsciously hold breath sometimes wearing mask. higher humidity inside mask also messes ur brain ur ability breathe normally. like oppressive feeling right thunderstorm consciously breath harder day two u get used it.

Westerners much easier asians honest. longer noses makes masks less likely stick ur mouth u breath in. makes breathing lot easier. past weekend. Saturday Sunday reporting 300 deaths 600. Nothing new Agreed IFR likely somewhere close 0.5%, comparison seasonal flu 0.05% Yes mean. 

I think reading much it. pre Covid report. motive misrepresent data. sick. Literally heard friend get tested saw doctor check up. doctor wear mask said, ""this fine"" turned positive. Oh wow I'm FIRE tonight means many get sick die infecting bunch people taking them. already several promising vaccines late stages trials. citizens ignorant dismiss science. works Oxford really came clutch one. nurse. people self quarentine instead occupying beds go truly sick. path cases going 15 0. asymptomatics, people get tests, people mildly ill bother getting tests, likely missed shit ton cases. many nobody knows yet. got someone Europe still agree, easily. 

I can't imagine another year feel like I'd kinda cool waiting least five person so... mean would awful think would worth wait. That's person. 

It's right call indeed. Oh man. pointed understand mistake.

As non-American think one time Trump actually made good decision talking Black community, Black People, US like monolith. like Asians Asian Americans monolith, either. 

The Black community also includes Black immigrants time time ignored conversation Black experience United States. American Black community issues, like every community high poverty levels, broader community address issues.

Your view Black Americans stereotypical assume think act even vast majority us making ""smart life decisions.""

Black immigrants African continent Caribbean tend fit ""model minority"", constantly ignored narrative. Black Americans acknowledge personal choice comes play, system made you, navigate it? mean ""isn't made you"" thought included thes inception, like Asian Americans, mean made keep lowest rungs hierarchy. Black Native communities alike occupy level therefore experience similar things time time forced poverty trying gain self-sufficiency, Black communities Rosewood Tulsa. 

I know well-intentioned, view Black Americans blames disenfranchised favor individual choices individual. someone option failing school system prison pipeline, two things work tandem, really choice? Rats carried bubonic plague Mickey Mouse help spread Covid. Seems fitting. know Di$ney thinking right squeeze money everybody pay hospital bills croak. Florida politics caters non-floridians. voters actively vote interests state here. allegiance pride state want pay penny fucking thing. politicians voters there's enough us natives anything it. reason downvoted.

1. terrestrial movement - what? suggesting large influx infected people crossing borders Canada Mexico? South Korean significant amount international flights S. Korea China, given proximity. 
2. societal cohesion thing plain false. Many people wear masks high-risk spaces stopped social distancing long ago. dig deeper, see South Korea preparing epidemic years - technology, testing, spread prevention strategies. done policy science. Policy changed COVID allowed advanced contact tracing, expense individuals' personal data. 
3. Smaller dense - write makes little sense here. S. Korea incredibly interconnected country, cheap domestic flights, advanced rail systems, well connected road system. Many people travel across cities, even across country daily work. Shipping, mail, movement goods typically takes 1 day, 2 days most, without express. population freely moves S. Korea someone moving home state. Sick dead teachers least worries kids bringing home parents become sick dead.

Edit: saying teachers aren’t important, meant won’t thinking teachers death you’re one that’s dying.

Except really pick him, whatever dumb bullshit kinda irrelevant sincerely get voted based public, got put government circles. vein Brexit massive waste energy populace voted flat ***lied too.*** guys blame quite literally used political machine, realizing *that* deeper actually 2 IQ emotion empathy rub together. 

A majority Americans support Trump never have, decades voter cancellation apathy let get power: Literally anyone party could became president party fucked elections hard enough occur. Blaming Trump America like blaming Brexit Europeans legitimately spoon fed bullshit, since that's complex thought people like avoid cause *actually intelligent empathetic* harder sweeping problems onto outdated stereotype America bastion white supremacy, fascism, obesity idiocy, things visible across pond EU, UK, Sweden, China, Russia, least form. Right, that's I'm saying. Even CDC suggested mostly likely 10x amount cases counted, more. THIS.

God, nation fucked  they're poor, they're rich? really get distinction.  Yep, go...

I think Harvard unaware ICE's announcement made decision. may possibly change mind. Seems like average 30 new cases day 1 million people WNY... Miami averages 1000 new cases per 1 million people day. Hospitalizations around 10% Covid. 1 100000 even close would expect reopen schools one month can't even 40 adults meet single time prior that? 7 day moving average today, continue increase. totally agree. Like sucks it’s scary fortunate medical equipment knowledge today. Multiple studies said wear mask, wear mask. Asymptomatic patience pass also asymptomatic patients capable passing it. also studys showing virus lives sewer system allowing move building. heard major testing lab till August. truth that? Fucking stop already. Republican strategy defund social programs work anymore point go ""look! Government programs work, let's privatize everything!"" Fucking hate bastards, happened education, healthcare, housing, fucking everything forgot black lives matter protests. actual number probably closer 20 million, still think LOT people board vaccine, assuming released early next year, things work. takes 4 6 weeks getting sick death. fear numbers coming 7 August. Report I'm replying comment Florida, I'm speaking *only* Florida. idea state sub 2% death rate need roll freezers pileup sensationalist best.  NYC shut inside dining due hotspot activity. think that's smart. imbecile would think safe enclosed restaurant. Irrrrr....ahem. ""Except really pick him""

Well win last general election, I'm sure would think picked.

Brexit, sure lot lying coming angles. think people know voting wrong. hey result different think been, must otherside idiots, right.

""onto outdated stereotype America bastion white supremacy, fascism, obesity idiocy""

Is outdated? think still see plenty evidence everywhere look. course Americans like that, mean can't still point ones are, many.
And sure, every country versions ok us mock too.

If want laughed nation trump better make damn sure there's different result come November, going get lot worse. important anything else, well said~ mothers nurse. manslaughter. gonna spend like $200 per person half Disney land available saw that. disgraceful.

Cuomo offered help last week. talking about.
 
Judging fact downvoted, seems like folks don’t want help. know bad US (I tri-state area heard sirens constantly every day months). think ridiculous compare things Japan covered lot stats. Compare things countries honest like South Korea Germany. Worst mean over. He's saying peak covid 19will around January. 

He also thinks probably fail hard mitigation vaccine rolls out, we've probably hit 50 60 percent infected. rest world appreciate us getting many people line.

Happy Holidays sure cancel new year's plans. people prefer deny horrible truth (we pandemic), face it.  It’s less stressful makes whole process easier. It’s hard situation. really hope family able figure something staying safe possible. solution, like government stepping help one make choices jeopardized safety family. CANT THAT!!! Yes, much so. State governors withheld militias, Jefferson Davis attempted defend Confederate territory equal effort, cabinet continuous flux various states jockeyed seats table. There's good argument made could least lost withdrawn defensible territory made cost invading high Union. [56 Florida hospital ICUs hit flu, bro. sky falling. less mild flu season. big deal all. 

LOL mean billy joe generic redneck name? think US going take extreme measures order get virus control again.  people commission almost point trying contain virus lower infection rate.  fucktards managed destroy months worth progress matter weeks days. back people believing now-debunked studies like Stanford antibody study. far less testing (so higher % undetected cases).

Probably best cite March article something like this. Pickin em might way. Greater good that.  Huh? said anytthing vaccine. Yeah honestly Disney mandating masks times, question enforce families there....so it’s probably safer supermarket Florida it’s needed. essential things open especially place red zone. Many experts disagree AAPs recommendation. Fauci included. literally is, people HOPING means people dying.

They're sick. fact post thousands upvotes shows negative subreddit is. swear half people want bad possible tell relatives told so. Fucking Tom Hanks talking people wearing masks gets 19K upvotes, barely gets 200. Give break. Still way high NYC. hadn’t placed Covid positive patients nursing homes, placed instead Javits center, USS Comfort (which initially meant non Covid patients, sent Covid patients error) many deaths would happened due Covid. Damn straight. Keep shit outta here.

Open comment CBSA: tell ""Alaskans"" fuck buy plane ticket. Used live Vegas - ah....Monday Night Jazz 4 Queens hotel. Cook E. Jar Crumbs (Continental) LOL. Still friends working. 

Anyways, Kansas City now. Lots jazz musicians here, nearly enough venues hire pre-pandemic despite 100 million USD sunk jazz district. Best luck you.  3 day weekend probably is. TN here. school revealed plan requiring masks students, going enforce social distancing classrooms buses “because it’s possible.” 35 students barely fit classroom is, several teachers literally closets classrooms. It’s upsetting. lump unelected government too. Looking US Army Corps Engineers. literally specified immunity building infrastructure fails catastrophically. Yup really load selfish bullshit. saw post Tom Hanks saying loses respect people can't bothered smart true. realize selfish pathetic many people life are. 

I sympathize people experiencing something gravity first time see weakness comes think excuses way they're reacting. Like they're children. (*screams Floridian, sobs scrubs*) Theoretically, CDC Ministry Health take matter higher level, government issue executive order legislator submit law hierarchical response mechanism place specific times, uniform rules people wear masks, disinfect, go outside.

Of course US can't that, Trump's voters people wear masks, Trump certainly thinks vote important comes lives COVID-19 patients vote

Only COVID-19 becomes pandemic among Trump's voters countless people die Trump able demand mandatory masks

America needs humanitarianism.

From Chinese.

in beijing school boards pointing state constitution doesn’t give authority pressing forward think best. teachers’ union going give nightmares. would go? Heh. time go see movie there's usually random couple sitting way back.

Nothing race, fuck race people. Ok mate. Dunno, better look 7 day moving average, know spike finally catching Exactly!

It's longer capitalism rigged game, privatize profits socialize risks losses. Well, yea. would insane want get mixed shit show. Arizona reported one death yesterday.

I also played Cook E Jar. He’s cool dude. 

Is Tommy Ruskin still playing around K.C. area? Gerald Spaits? Bram Wijnands? looked CFR today, would ~1.29% (2,823 deaths/219,420 cases) that's assuming everyone diagnosed since recovered, obviously case. Deaths laging indicator really whole lot good try use time frame ended week ago.

Yesterday saw 85 deaths 9,414 cases. CFR July 6th would've ~.9% even though likely almost one diagnosed day died (barring late arrival hospital terms progression one's illness postmortem diagnosis). deaths yesterday's testing probably trickle next month outliers extending even beyond that. put me! Now!

And registered volunteer maybe I’ll get sooner rather later. I'm optimistic. too. Wtf about? appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* Yeah effect even stronger weekend holiday. 350 fewer deaths recorded Saturday, Sunday Monday compared week prior. point? trolls move stat derail fuck threads.

What I'm cool starting back person 3 weeks, apparently school is... :/ science told Pluto planet. science says Pluto planet.

And wonder believe science.


aH kNoW MuH rIgHTs!!! That’s point. US, pressing surgeries avoided April early May. 

In late May June, US hospitals performed record numbers surgeries. 

Coincidentally, COVID-19 ICU patient numbers increased afterwards. 

So, question anyone tried collect data verify two related? Haha, yeah, we're really going poor countries. That's interesting line thought. read somewhere (reliable) deaths influenza among asthmatics actually lower general population. One thoughts asthmatics seek medical care earlier thus better outcomes. Another likely inhaled corticosteroids likely less inflammation.

It's interesting question.

And stockpiled asthma medication back February March. asthma way going screw around trying find new meds pandemic. Public transportation. repeat public transportation. obvious main source. forget ""five dolla sucky sucky, ten dolla long time"". yelled couple times. lost largest margin US president terms raw votes, Russian interference also went France, Germany elections Brexit. way Bush Gore, cause powers demanded average voter. going foreigners need shove uninformed bullshit. That's I've doing, nostalgic AF love/hate it. stupid policy going get people killed  Nope. One county near passed mask ordinance sheriff promptly announced wouldn’t enforce, live ordinance. Almost businesses actually require it. I’m assuming mask usage among employees stores require them, customers. 

The place I’ve walked anywhere sign requiring masks eye clinic. That's Malaysia, problems, headed group cartoon villains literally everything enrich cronies expense absolutely everyone else. zero evidence support theory say joke...lol Give already.  matter data people never change fact virus exactly dangerous people say is. worry Jared someone sell confiscated PPE back states need buddies take cream top Even aren’t hospital thing really suck it’s scary family. sister 24, healthy, overweight, underlying conditions. She’s sick 14 days diagnosed pneumonia she’s likely least another week shit, assuming doesn’t get worse I’m obviously hoping for. She’s nurse fresh school sent COVID unit dumb fucks Phoenix can’t think anyone themselves. Wear mask stay bars restaurants people. bubonic plague, cholera, TB, life expectancy highest ever been.....for part, fight war.... Another CT resident - confirm mask use general respect situations. Also many businesses accommodating social distancing prioritizing curbside pickups, etc.

I see current hospitalizations up, number driven less discharges vs admissions, good sign true. also means nobody “discharged” body bag. 

I don’t think politician anything perfectly, say coordination governed well Gov’s Murphy Cuomo regional conference driver success. “prosperity” brought average spending power competitive wealthy utopias Mexico, Thailand Belarus. work really hard rate couple decades they’ll able double spending power get Slovenia now. Maybe parity Lithuania better goal since they’re 50% wealthy. Currently they’re barely Iraq. 

Minimum wage Shanghai (the highest China) $358 month. Median spending power taxes $2619 year nationally. make $50 week taxes. studio apartment Shanghai runs $550 month, 1 BR roughly $1100. arrangement common China. vast majority earned wages go basic living expenses. “Slavery extra steps” prosperity. Tinman sheet metal cock? sure, takeout viable substitute restaurants. agree, every time news vaccine someone comes ""a vaccine never found hiv"" ""we live forever"". agree people need live carefully time, modern medicine going help us get this. oh well can't damage first place. think immune could still carriers/spreaders. get it’s clothes someone sneezing them, bodies carries disease spread it? False narrative positive outlook situation Well, positive effects restrictive diet would even incredible. Well played. ever played pandemic social isolating hardcore.

Asking another data point, rather discussing people asking another data point, fact, science.

Or ""are published science author, am"" route want.

Edit: Take ""you people"" go. sibling doctor central Texas got reassigned COVID floor today. She’s terrified practices awful. converted patient room floor across nurses station (nurses wearing droplet masks btw, m95s). go regular floor check patients wearing COVID ppe. basically thinks already gotten contaminated first day. aren’t even full capacity yet. Many tests suck lot oversight them. said, given good test, think evidence anything like ""February? Nah, certainly antibodies now!"". evidence people may last months, even less asymptomatic. I'd still expect substantial amount people February test positive. seems like it’s combination factors, plus doctors finally finding promising drugs aren’t quick ventilate understanding grows. understanding NY deaths didn’t really start spike hospitals totally overwhelmed, nurses doctors working 16 hours day, every day, mistakes made overworked medical personnel hospitals space. critical patient hospital, it’s easier treat hospital, reloading person can’t breathe back ambulance taking overflow shelter side town may kill them, get bed hall. use. President United States can't even face coronavirus.

In Trump's seriousness, hundreds thousands dead people far less important vote

Covid soon back, greater numbers needed 10 million cases exponentially spreading virus confirm this? thought job prevent pandemics help world instead waiting till already full-blown. Hate break year estimates overly optimistic exaggerations. I'm security guard research center they're working vaccine. I've chatted couple people working labs. acknowledged vaccine within year possible way aliens visiting ancient Egypt possible. possible anything possible likely. true? thought much less time that. thought 3 weeks max symptoms death. Probably won’t help likely know this, keep going excess deaths say “something killed 120,000 Americans since March 1” bounces off. Two classmates HS went PAs, they’re excellent. Definitely smart enough doctors, chose PA reasons. many people know prefer PA doc. I’ve personally never doc PA, can’t speak perspective. guess PAs RNs (the mom) excellent, there’s probably reason two married other. sad. hope don’t kids. Yeah, fact slightly fewer people died last 7 days 7 days that. Deaths still downward trajectory, though it’s shallow one. bleach injection. Maybe people afraid virus spiraling control US.  People afraid.  Fear make coward anything people continually sticking heads asses cowards. rules crisis management building earning trust via transparency consistency message. 

The early messaging wear masks really stretched people's trust Fauci Surgeon General guy unfortunately.  Well, Sheriffs voted county, people county give fuck, would Sheriff? I’m ‘what eating next’ stage prison. mean added last 7 days including today compared previous 7 days. data website though, 7-day average Tuesday us 556 vs 575 last Tuesday. awareness hiv stage epidemic, we'd say 5-7 days mild flu like illness, followed recovery :-/ 

There lots reasons different, know everything. is, that's want know, especially since tests prioritized sick. positive rate super low means testing lot still finding much, test numbers accurate low.

If get high rate know test overwhelmed, people probably getting tested. know actual number much higher test results. reality, also shows can't even test sick people, can't contain high rate showing control. source IQ one metrics use measure intelligence? intelligence measured? give sources like ones provided. one's provided opinion pieces read would notice filled sources support theories. 

GPA standardized tests scores example intelligence, examples well someone school standardized exam excludes outside factors outside tutoring test prep. example, 
familiarity course test materials, ability hire tutors take pretest similar time testing environment MCAT, course help someone score higher.

3.8 GPA measure intelligence. measures well school. knew people 4.0 GPAs maintained average taking less rigorous classes. can't forget someone's school also comes play schools known grade inflation inflates GPAs. Also, assume people can't cheat pay someone work take rigorous classes local community college transcient student transfer credits literally anything else common place many undergraduate institutions US. 

What listed good markers preparedness, consistency, even money (whether family, personal, government aid), intelligence. 

Human intelligence cannot easily measured. definitely calculated system tests limited culturally/socially relevant knowledge. data ever before.  concern trolling getting really fucking old. Keep 'yer stick ice! Oddly enough, started talking someone area. I'll PM. success vaccine achieving herd immunity depend effectiveness uptake (percentage population gets vaccine) duration immunity, least duration gets past 6 months? words, given choice following scenarios:

(a) Vaccine 70% effective, 60% population gets vaccine (within time interval months), immunity lasts 10 years

(b) Vaccine 90% effective, 80% population gets vaccine (within time interval months), immunity lasts 1 year

Scenario (b) would preferable pandemic would end long end 1 year immunity period. basing immunity common cold coronaviruses. SARS 2003 virus, antibodies lasted like years cell immunity lasted 17 years. unreasonable think, immunity covid behave similar way.

plus vaccine give stronger immunity response. like you. Nope. rich people politicians need get Corona family first. talk. Well. bad.  done google searches found nothing. 

A really simple way measure would tracking percent new daily cases surgery last 60 days.

So far, state health department, private hospital university John’s Hopkins released data. Yeah, brown people shithole country. /s mention potential risk active shooter top Next list. science. spent past 4 months watching people sub hop one stat another order downplay seriousness pandemic.  soon whatever stat people fixating longer suits agenda immediately start harping stat process repeat itself. 56k sounds insane think US 60 65k days week. post history literally 2 months multiple posts day /r/coronavirus, /r/covid19, literally nothing else...that's...*odd*... never blamed social media everybody US like since March, virus would gone now. 84 days smoke free here. took worldwide pandemic finally quit smoking. I've certainly found positive test rate graphs online. They're useful got tested REALLY obviously due lack tests. nearly 7x number total cases per capita Germany. Well, suppose choices either keep working school counselor pick new skills change professions. I'm really sure kind answer looking here. denial personal political reasons? Bro...you're one said solution ""put sheriffs leave without pay""

Then moved goal post ""withhold state funds"" pointed possible. never conflated two. 

Then pulled ""lawyer"" card...on reddit. C'mon dude...that shit works tiddy bars...

If thought solution ""withhold state funds"" say one first? 😆 guess opening arguments foreign concept too. ..This title. Dont edit anyway, get coronavirus Well, needed cut spending make sure nobody believed climate change enough satisfy corporate masters, win-win joke, legit argument coworker today claiming rise COVID state taking care illegal immigrants. dumbfounded. I’ve started valuing time more. Like one point realized days flying started spending time things. Well, that's upkeep cost gotta pay #1 project power around globe.

Anyone want nuclear deterrence aim gun U.S. U.S. aim entire world. is. sub nutshell. Considering many people look like they’re wearing masks, beg differ they’re “not mindless.” Yikes though, real. EXACTLY Ummm. corona virus symptoms typically present around day 6-14 infection, approximately 8-10 days onset see ICU admission. patients spend approximately 2-3 weeks vented. Additionally we’re seeing younger patients getting sicker sicker.

Regardless, keep trust faith something positive got give somewhere. better this. sounds scary! Hope friend ok. big change (e.g. percentage baseline) see RHR readings? skimmed quickly results saw residuals plotted. Chinese, Trump actually smart, personal gain

From national competition level, Chinese really hate Trump, take NBA example, what's wrong major player competing team never thinks team brushes numbers, contract year team bottom table

But humanitarian point view, he's costing countless people lives, anti-human.

Covid messed everyone's plans. must chance come China later. suspect little insight bad outside delhi, mumbai, chennai, etc.

It's basically nothing outside cities. think basically gone rural areas thousands dying one reporting it, poorly implemented migrant workers fleeing cities droves probably inundated rural areas virus. 

Some went, majority went later tested later. Stop spreading misinformation know.

Arguably two cities lost Delhi Mumbai. 

Even Chennai cases going up, still fine regard hospitalizations deaths, one lowest percentages world. ""Some may die, sacrifice I'm willing make.""

Unless plan lock residents, eventually outbreaks happen again. Yep. way learn count different. international system, period 3 digits, commas 3 digits apart. Indian system, first period 3 digits, period 2, numbers written like

So word 100k, one 1 million (we'll call 10 lakhs). One key implication never say 100 lakh, 100 crore (1 crore = 10⁷), switch next period 2 zeroes, would 1 crore 1 arab respectively.

They mandatory quarantine though. can’t help imagine people quarantine tracked.

The news doesn’t talk much quick google search ‘quarantine tracking’ brings lot interesting stories.

I actually like analysis think good read.

How anything said wrong? well documented. Same. know excess deaths numbers underreported. Funny people care much data never ask particular metric. First announced battle COVID-19 April?? heart skipped reading that. And, workers got transferred Covid patients. happen Florida. know -- Brooks County, whose county seat Falfurrias, Far South Texas, Corpus Christi area Rio Grande Valley (Cameron, Hidalgo Starr counties)

EDIT ADD: [Brooks rather sparsely populated, less 7,500 residents. according Infection2020.com, picked first COVID case 4/22; cases 6/14, got 1 6/15, 1 6/22... **3** last Friday (7/3) another 3 Sunday (7/5). 

In words they've low case counts ... recently, things become somewhat exponential. Brooks County Sheriff taking steps prevent things getting exponential. Especially since, TX county 20 fewer cases, apply countywide waiver Gov. Abbott's recent mask mandate [Guess pray hard  This. Asymptomatic means quite literally that, symptoms. There's plenty asymptomatic cancer patients, including terminal know yet. definition use. nah completely get people that. definitely way expect people fight undefined marathon. Based small sample license plates TransCanada NB back NS Monday (on way home visiting family within Atlantic bubble), there's quite Ontarians Quebecers coming east coast. get it, people entitled cross provincial borders. really hope they're adhering self-isolation rules. large aging population. I'd really rather restrictions reimposed. realize idiotic anecdote sounds someone saying you? realize starters, even actually providing context ""2x harder""?

Is cloth masks? Surgeon masks? N95? Sealed face coverings? 

Does 2x harder actually involve lung strain? 2x actually anything fucking ass value? republican governors seem lot like republican president. buck stop? It’s presidents fault it’s governors job... it’s governors job it’s mayors? Sheriffs? Who’s going fix this? save people’s lives? 10? least 60 am. late anyway  Maybe Mexico agree pay wall, heck, even build one themselves. law enforcement country fucking control? won’t jobs, offices disbanded entirely.  heard great podcast recently degradation US soft-power around world intrinsic factor American decline. latest move seems fit well. FREEDOM /s That's interesting.  state getting really bad press really good results. April 14, US Department State released report investigation Sujiatun Embassy Beijing Consulate Shenyang. report said: ""No evidence discovered says place used purpose public March 2006, Falun Gong-backed Epoch Times published allegations three individuals thousands Falun Gong practitioners killed Sujiatun Thrombosis Hospital supply China's organ transplant month, U.S. representatives said found evidence site northeast China used concentration camp, though ""the United States remained concerned China's repression Falun Gong practitioners reports organ harvesting"". Harry Wu, Chinese dissident human rights activist, said ""no concrete substantiated evidence, documents photos, provided support witness' statements"".***  forget lots meth. Meth makes lack cardio. Actually found nursing home patients overwhelmingly got workers, hospital transfers. Defund fuckers. people saying exact stupid bullshit number infections even weeks ago?  One cause hope Biden could prevent scenario describe withdrawal WHO. Many international organizations built-in withdrawal procedures meant last years designed prevent countries making decisions lightly. Trump start processes loses November, Biden could stop it.

But flip side, don’t think many international organizations left Trump gets re-elected. Everything becomes fair game. WTO NATO, G7, free trade agreement, etc. it’s hard see organizations survive let alone thrive without US. influence China Russia becomes disproportionate.

I think NATO actually safest institution though, hawkish wing GOP joint chiefs would revolt given it’s mostly security issue there’s lot Cold War nostalgia there. much leeway targeting trade, climate change, even arms treaties political nature. Lol not. people saying masks asked stay large crowds infringe ""freedom"". Hell ya, let's get shoot going masks. Wonder sometimes people ever consider stupid seem rest world. course, would depend actually knowing rest world there. Kind answers question. Yeah bunch younger people getting it, need couple cycles infection ensure grandma/older essential worker etc catches they're grocery store picking 6 pack etc. latter. flu vaccine based last seasons flu sometimes it’s effective sometimes it’s renewed annually. Hong Kong children manage fine masks.

Fauci actually recommended article cited: ""...Modifications could breaking class crowded classroom, maybe half morning, half afternoon, children alternate schedules. There's whole bunch things one do."" 

With infections climbing 32 states, full-time school every kid possible without lot money, vaccine, widespread death hospitalization.

There ice can't anything. Easy that. I've seen lot people say ""we can't keep (city, state, country....) shut indefinitely,"" I've seen literally nobody suggest should. words still strung together?

His lack support school districts definitely looks like he's laying groundwork something, call failure. No, July 1 included second week. July 30th first week. Admittedly, miscounted timing deaths, numbers combine wash opposed 600 deaths either direction. Completely agree. People resisting masks ignoring social distancing seen COVID patients first-hand. most, might see young person get flu-like symptoms, complain get better. see ones get better easily.

Yeah, mean, person tested: ""it sucks takes 5-7 days get results. imagine many people infect."" me: ""that's quarantine"" sure, come work. boss care. that's contain thing, right?! Eating rich sounds better. Same, plus insanely stoned past six months. Seems like half years bad dreams  Fyi, Appears graduation occurred around 6/22 case identified 7/7.... that's 14 days point all, totally misreading comment. way whatsoever trying downplay effects Coronavirus.

My comment response get privilege billed whatever demonic soul crushing amount money potentially life threatening illness may already spread asymptomatically friends family.

That comment replying to... read, seemed imply would hook / sued medical bills others caught asymptomatic (or pre-symptomatic). That's far cry downplaying effects virus.

EDIT: Oh, see now, comment people get Coronavirus need hospitalized.

All saying majority people get coronavirus need admitted hospital receive care survive. That's say lingering damage (there many people), people get Coronavirus need admitted hospital. guarantee you, case, would very, different (and much serious diar) situation (not downplay current pandemic, bad enough, pre-antibiotic Bubonic-Plague level MERS-level).

Yes, complications, among need hospitalized (or even asymptomatic), that's point. get virus, likely need hospitalized. Unbelievable man.... “Correlation imply causation” -literally everybody wants sound scientifically literate doesn’t anything add conversation wasn’t. lot independents right weren’t convinced would actually bad. know sure. “My worry millions people COVID-19 now. year’s time 10 million recovered people, people cognitive deficits ... that’s going affect ability work ability go activities daily living,” Adrian Owen, neuroscientist Western University Canada, told Reuters interview.

This people think number deaths relevant figure ignoring. lot middle ground ""dead"" ""recovered"". article specifically examines effects brain seen examples COVID attacking pretty much every organ body now. I'm outside Atlanta NW Cobb too. Mask up. Wash hands. well   Thank much! you?  Always. search location. Luckily(?) live hot spot right testing Oxford vaccine near me. way kind scary many states nurse practitioners allied medical professionals take place primary care doctor, prescribing rules loosened, practioner rules loosened. open access medical care doctor shortage, also opens door sickness death individuals much rigorous academic training necessarily someone medical school. parents sound like religious, think denomination fairly fervent, lack precise term. heartbreaking. Also, feel maybe knew hospitals like, feared hospitals overcrowding. may also known low success rate intubation. may daughter would died anyway, complicating illness history/risk factors low success rate intubation, even intubated. That's lesson's learned rely one oneself go doctor. know teen wanted. But, super sad. probably trouble profession, law. feel really bad them, family/daughter's fate. Yes, exposed her. lot churches taking risks, religious institutions well surmise. Also, religious institutions, desperate businesses closing eyes giving up. huge warning. sane people aren’t rooting people die It’s funny argument American sub ~2monhs ago saying per capita numbers way Americans favour wouldn’t rise. 

Looks like right, crazy data science become reality. ya bud? Kind like shouting ""all lives matter"" refusing wear mask. 

Then shit like Stage 4 denial. everywhere can't cut away. need blast whole US huge amounts Facts constant debunking bad info well spreading it. maybe keep may able walk again. resigned, would someone appointed who’s much worse stating correct things. new person would perfectly align whims administration show exceptional loyalty. That’s whole reason Fauci never talked negatively current administration. here.

Heh. could closer truth want contemplate. learnt enough already China last months. Here's supporting document. 

i search cdc's data base compare pneumonia deaths past 5 years year's covid + pneumonia deaths.

base WOM's death count 128774 6/29, weve undercounted 37% deaths far year weve 48k pneumonia deaths avg 5 previous years

source: thought I'm saying wrong, know trust publication called MedicalXpress Russian doctor says chloroquine shown benefits treating COVID-19. That's utterly laughable coming you. probably even know wet market big standing one. makes sense 5G cause pandemic anyway look it. Well..that's true! someone working 70 hours week contact tracing pandemic- close coworkers this. investigated many cases caused this, especially retail.  Customer-facing workers close contact coworkers day spread, go mask free meeting back managers everyone gets covid. Restaurant workers wear masks front spread drop masks back talk group coworkers get covid. Super responsible hostess takes mask break, gets covid barfly server takes cancer patient dad, ends hospital. Masks 100% drastically reduce spread, especially work spend much time around others. People fucking stupid, #'s area blowing many still freak concept wearing mask store. select group, society large mediated certain select groups. that's fair statement Yeah, stability transport? gyms shut again? didn’t beat Hillary Clinton much dramatically worse polls time too. There’s need prove wanted dead,

There want convict murder instead manslaughter keep increasing too. 1000 day likely 250,000 November election. Okay, yes agree case  Obvious headline obviously obvious. know China handled well enough think that. 

They might look like it.

Edit: Chinese nationalists behind post. businesses still failing inform employees timely manner, all; people like see family friends turn test positive employer report positive case them, everyone wanted go Spam Italian Restaurant Grandma, drink bar friends damned enticing. *That's* why. July 4th perfect help spread even further, amongst friends, coworkers, family. mayor said NPR yesterday Phoenix public health department relying librarians public works folks administer tests have.

I zero sympathy city/state taken *most basic* steps manage themselves, especially state proud little government tolerate. That’s actually happening right East Africa Southern Asia. Looks like person whose comment quoted deleted account. take small measure satisfaction that. company group call today discuss return office. HR person outlined plan made people wear masks enter work get desks, majority day desks employees free take masks off. inquired procedure decided upon, allowing people remove masks, HR person said studies shown wearing masks day unhealthy leads higher CO2 rates.  

What saying brain damage wave already here. Good luck stay safe! register? comes triage, yes. People self-inflicted conditions placed behind became sick fault own. happened prior sign, end line? again, pass implement suspension habeas corpus, it'll stand sees judicial review stay pending judicial review. Except people clearly go fat American stereotype ignoring say Britain getting fatter year beating us that. uninformed claiming blacks simply worse taking care health problems, everyone France coward. Stereotypes key sign people uninformed, even act uninformed taking offense it. Brexit Johnson result EU's system spout stereotypes bad teeth entrenched sexism ignoring grander problem? I'm living hell we're two working parents two young kids child care. feels like can't good enough employee father. mind getting back normal shitty office. ripped cousin new one today said wear mask around even though I'm high risk. head far Freedumb's ass wear mask around 90 year old grandma wanted to. people even see light family actually dies handicapped this. wonder would matter even then.


To fair, he's several states away grandma, isolating let near us anyway we're fucking idiots. fully support BLM also see selfish thing. mean benefit friendlier less authoritarian police force? mean knowing checks place abuse power makes feel easier see one go street.

I'm white, never broke law, one ticket, never drugs prescribed, still get apprehensive see cop go by. Can't imagine black must feel, guess maybe like Jew seeing Nazi pass front window... maybe Anne Frank Nazis inspecting building hiding in....

Native Americans, Asians, Hispanics, going benefit.

It's kinda like woman marries jackass two kids abuses (the white, Asian, Hispanics), well abuses kids 100* still abuses others. One day enough runs car. benefits most? benefit (just him)... 

Systemic police abuse reform trickle across races make abused least abused nobody ever abused. 

I mean scenario could take away step kids would make bad rest need something holistic like civilian vs police bill rights cannot violated without guaranteed jail time.

I mean protest blm white matter 80 year old man police gonna knock see war. brother EMT Florida gets sick dies murderous public policy decisions GOP asshole politicians refuse listen public health experts, god help know do. highly doubt normal weekend. long weekend. eating in. Good cook. posted much same. organization got PPP loan saved us. money go employees approved expenses rent, mortgage, utilities etc... everyone posting seems think companies pocket money. might right don’t think so. DeWine laying groundwork now. realistically can’t keep state shut indefinitely. Nice. Exactly Please sign help save lives lower cases.  friend mine works assisted living facility, says can't report sick patients technically 'Floridians'. understand either! agree im Canadian worried recently feeling sore tired got period haha charged. vile human beings dead teenage daughter. thats still uptick though, last two weeks tuesdays near bad. Plus lag cases testing deaths? idea 100 countries roughly equal power, nuclear era, sounds like recipe horrifying catastrophe. fewer great powers are, lower odds losing balance atomic tightrope. Every powerful state another possible point failure. took 9 days friend get results CA. Galaxy brain Well... read yours.. 

And polite. Numbers spiking significantly 4th. tactic work Memorial Day going work either. BUILD WALL Governor DeSantis must like watching nearly naked men jumping top other, trying pin down. ""Youths"" Or, know... Everyone could wear mask. small businesses got whopping $1. Guess would make look good put list businesses received “help.” Yup! let's open schools....  good attempt grand experiment democracy then.

Hope generations come us learn mistakes. tough people imagine solved quickly. People disillusioned articles like because, unrelated covid, see time articles advancements science make great headline, reality practical use still far worse.

It help really quick. vaccine may cure covid, could side effects spring year we're completely unaware of. live Norway opening border towards Sweden time soon. Hopefully numbers summer next year. always wonder could happen. repeat again, Corona around least 10 000 years. mutation suddenly disappear?

The human body learned handle mutation, one. making least 600 week tips anyways. It’s bittersweet 10D Underwater Mahjong. Meanwhile Kanye friggin West's company got least $2,000,000 assistance. deforestation one component issue. stop destroying homes animals meant live close humans, we'll keep epidemics pandemics. I'm sure supercomputer considered fact populace city like Tokyo tin foil wearing, gun toting, science denying, whiny non mask wearing citizens. I’m sure plenty traffic jams US lowering death count

Death count rising though. Are.. baddies now...? neither. much gets withheld us... Chinese counting 10^4 least consistent:

* 1,0000,0000 Chinese 
* 10,00,00,000 Indian 
* 100,000,000 international. got it. people ""scare mongering"" happens. Fauci careful tip toeing around Trump, things must going real bad break this. Trump says 'disagrees' 'all good'. time wants fault Fauci recommending masks, meanwhile still mandate recommend shitty events.  Maybe robot overlords better current ones. Hmmm basically....fuck majority unemployed lol. Coworkers family members going Vegas another Miami. WTF! Sorry poor attempt wit. try resubmit longer. 7-day rolling average trending upwards nationally. Close keep closed. came back Canada husband home quarantine check us every couple days. answer lot questions government. asked swimming lakes rivers property, taken garbage out, taken walk outside property. hadn’t course. explained came apartment U.S. peed cup car fear exposure haven’t seen light day three months. I’m scared shitless covid completely respect measures Canadians protect people enforce quarantine act.If break quarantine act fines jail time severe. swear oath coming back. I’m sure anyone who’s unfit coming getting in. guess could lie seems like government would find Cambridge Harvard universities this?

I'll applying Cambridge entrance 2021, even accept attend, fees EU students increased 25 000 per year. HOWEVER, classes online, maybe I'll consider it, since paying living expenses (not I'm hoping coronavirus pandemic still going course) increase heart activity unique COVID normal response infection?

I heart problems usually flare day 2 show symptoms infection like flu need supercomputer tell limiting people trains letting fresh air might help? We're going sneak Mexico Canada fly airports American agree. sure countries would treat better. surely can’t increase cases past weeks. /s local Sikhs donated food staff hospital work at. included individual thank cards us. heartwarming gesture food delicious. . . . nothing. Independent contractors temporarily hired WWE. Less testing means less cases COVID-19. heard before. Keep border closed! agonizing this, big deal. Keep shut forever, gives shit? CANADA real issue. means near enough testing done many people walking around infected knowing it. someone watching reality said,get ready new round talking points mass protests constant riots carry risk transferring diseases, gardening fireworks going work does.

Stay ignorant friends. get deaf indoctrination. McConnell finally open giving aid again. seems wants give little people make $40,000 year. None models make assumption universal mask wearing. Plus many models repeatedly overestimated rise deaths, underestimated.

The consensus models around 140-175k deaths. Even extreme predictions go 200k. I'd put money breaking 200k August. Jokes Canada seen border fence bald patch trees imma run across slap one maple trees Put zoo belong mean usa around 600 death per day average right now. Going 3k death per day AVERAGE end month probably happen. Altough could well august cases rising fast. 

What mean probability? think deaths really 500% week? used loophole serve food open bar/restaurant. True. Better nothing though. Could increase fine subsequent offense. know tell ya, care. Even Schumer saying go state unemployment rates fair people parts states unemployment rampaging. No, medication narcolepsy. technically sodium oxybate sodium salt same, breaks GHB hits stomach acid. called Xyrem. actually medicine available actually treats cause narcolepsy keeping brain regulated sleep cycles. literally get zero percent deep sleep without matter many hours sleep. causes increased fatigue narcolepsy symptoms like sleep paralysis, hypnagogic hallucinations, sleep attacks, Cataplexy. Every medicine market stimulant acts brain make feel awake. Right mean much due lag reporting deaths.  many times need go people stop spamming threads nonsense? guess riots protests good stopping communicable diseases.

Thank local governments. blood test kind thick blood, would show abnormal right? simple ""make decision.""

There people would take $500 fine say ""I give fuck, take risk getting fine."" People speeding time. They've saying wait two weeks ten weeks now. Today finally day sun. 900 deaths.... ""Jonestown Massacre"" amount deaths today... I'm sure mean scientifically literate, read medical reports (see subsequent comment). add conversation? Meanwhile ex constantly posts Facebook pics new husband kids, masks, due another one October. 

People really care pandemic assistance extended past 31st, see end United States. want see BLM protestors anti-BLM protestors streets rioting looting together one? Throw wolves food money pandemic. would done many countries \*hard\* real lockdown, dealing this. Well lie. Educate topic answering.

Sweden many things, it’s response similar Finland example. article

**At least 31 states showed upward trend average new daily cases -- increase least 10%** \-- last seven days, Tuesday morning, according data Johns Hopkins University.

Those states are: Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, California, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, New Jersey, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Washington state, West Virginia Wisconsin.

**Only four states seen average daily cases decline 10%** seven days: Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire Rhode Island. definitely shouldn’t get complacent, think masks social distancing contribute decreasing spread virus, also decreasing case fatality rate. clear back March even February viral load related severity, everyone wear masks social distance, even get virus, much lower quantities would otherwise. 

Supposedly, also treating effectively, although I’m entirely sure that. submission removed because


**Titles must edited source.** submissions must submitted original title submitted article applicable. article uses caps title, changed [title Editorialization via title editing kind likely removed. ([More believe made mistake, please [message moderators](/message/compose?to=/r/Coronavirus).* countries much better... mean New Zealand like what... 5 cases today? understand social distancing masks work... provide much analysis say higher average perhaps death due coronavirus 8 times higher statistically valid IMO. I've lived Florida since 2006 living Oklahoma. Hurricanes way.

Hurricane main danger comes category. cat 5 hits you, evacuate. anything less, shelter place unless reason stay. hurricane super wendy heavy rain nothing terrible.

I've lived several hurricanes worst happened power loss days, sucked could live got power.

For tornados. We've given little hour notice seek shelter immediately. get school I'm holding door getting ready force close(winds strong) cat comes flying strikes brick wall going splat.

Then over, went one neighbourhood looked completely flattened neighborhood help try find pull people buildings. Pulling people shattered glass sticking every part body insane. Even found someone car flipped upside thrown side try. Luckily hit passenger side, call someone saw (jaws life always slammed) cut out.

So yeah. Hurricanes easy. live cat 5, leave. give mandatory evac. leave. Drive north get hotel/motel even sleep car. Rental insurance 200 year cover lose something happen (same home owners insurance) life goes on.

The people die hurricanes die ignoring rules.

I want live someplace die warning. Antagonizing entire country misconception? ignorant you! Crawl back bridge. figures distressing realise disease treatable then. long ago reading death rate ventilator patients gone 1 8 1 20 2.5 x better odds becausewe got better treatments. know today vs June 10th month still makes comparison worse   Blatant lying going change this.  right part reason things spiraling control. dishonesty creating false sense safety making things worse. want put *more* people jail pandemic going on. going mass people ignoring it? going arrest all? me. always get spike I'm ill allergies start act up. I'm shocked even know begin. could known opening indoor crowded venues bad ventilation multi touch surfaces would bad idea? It'

No one could predicted outcome! HELL?!?! TALK ANYTHING SUB? CCP enacted law makes illegal *anyone*, *worldwide* criticize actions HK? fair's fair. Go look daily case rate Germany, Italy, America India. Germany Italy strict lockdown, basically stopped virus. America weak lockdown reduced cases -30%. India slowed growth actually follow lockdown. Indian failure obvious data. 

The Indian government said year food supply locked down. Based that, India could locked longer getting results.

""Infections expected continue rising steadily India. Experts advising federal government say authorities prioritise reducing mortality containing spread Bret Hart test positive covid-19 working WWE, Vince's response would course ""Bret scrweed Bret"" You’re completely right, lab put paper 2018 similar patterns show rhinovirus coronaviruses (common colds) flu showed applies COVID-19 here. big effort phase 2 seeing anything unique COVID-19 distinguish it. 12 17 ahaha, he's middle pandemic?!

And people vote again? Even video games taught young age sometimes go left order *really* go right slight detour. correlation: COVID pneumonia &amp; lung cavitation.

I can't access full original report, could find another clear explanation pulmonary cavitation (such secondary infection, autoimmune disorder, pulmonary embolism side dominantly affected cavitation). nonspecific laboratory abnormalities. cite previous reports typical pulmonary imaging features COVID- cavitation notably absent. 

in essence, observation single patient unusual outcome- cavitation- setting COVID pneumonia. news article states ""it unclear caused case"". 

however, cursory reading article (or glancing article title) might suggest COVID causes lung cavitation. fact, title original report ""lung cavitation due COVID pneumonia""- one easily read COVID pneumonia directly results lung cavitation, i.e. causation. 

without additional case reports case series, huge stretch TIME take case report assume correlation i.e. COVID pneumonia &amp; lung cavitation equals causation i.e. COVID pneumonia causes lung cavitation. People sub saying 60-75k deaths improbable.  think people actually understand probability is. litteral stock photo, bad one that. sad, it? hard impossible. also live neighborhood occupied month protesters. June, heard gunshots 5 10 consecutive days. Two people killed blocks live. also numerous break-in attempts building police would come due occupied area. So, lot stress addition virus. I'm special tough out. Fair point. Probably take year migration start Australia/NZ again. can’t know actually data 

Am person worried statement ???. 
Everybody eager obvious reasons hail mary. See edit comment, think got misunderstood. like literally failing grasp air. feel like humid, hot harder breath, like light asthma attack. Still, wear masks needed.  Similar story here. big hospital city, didn’t care all. go university hospital took entire year convince doctors. surgery last week still fighting insurance it, keep pretending nothing going on, surgery pleasure. RemindMe! 2 months 'Pro life' actually 'anti young-women'. Half students young women. Connection ! Scenario 3 Chinese actually did, ever happen America. Wait, what’s that? Australia entering winter? virus couldn’t possibly appeared controlled due pandemic starting summer right?

I’m saying, given much don’t actually know virus still, Southern Hemisphere could rude awakening.

Yes cases “surging” US UK despite summer, virus extensively present community, whereas pandemic beginning Australia hit summer. 

I wish Southern Hemisphere best, said I’ll say again: don’t know virus, might rude awakening conditions ripen.. edging 50,000 week 56,000 suddenly look like much anymore. hand keeping numbers 50 days 100 suddenly disaster.

I guess lot Americans gotten used horrible numbers. eyes open need go hospital broken arm beds available Hire private security unfortunately. Gonna need bouncers Walmart FML. long enough timeline, survival rate everyone drops zero. keep hearing good job MD done. making difference? enforcement going on? Lol dude *fuck off* weirdo. Holy shit creepy 😆 I'm American think stay closed. need keep disaster rolling Visit linked subreddit risk. may high amount misinformation.

Shit, 5 billion years sun leave main sequence go red giant...so what's problem? point article. 🤦🏻‍♂️ seems though amount ventilation plays significant role. Also, crowds streets touch surfaces much.

So, imagine 10 people sitting somewhat spaced meeting room hours relatively poor ventilation, also touching surfaces like door handles staff handling dirty plates etc. 

To extent infected person shedding infectious material air (Ie microdroplets), amount may linger, accumulate, get plenty time others present exposed.

In room, might shared contact via surfaces (eg, door handles our).

If number people distance outside, amount microdroplets little opportunity accumulate linger, concentration lower duration exposure less anyone nearby. also won’t tend touch many surfaces common. might possible natural UV exposure also may help increase rate decay viral content exposed surfaces.

I’m expert, seem good reasons expect outdoor (and therefore open air) setting would tend far better indoor spaces. honestly everybody keep americans long Trump say country. #USexit last sentence see virtually zero mention US MSM yet important! emphasis cases deaths. Nothing even 'long'-term effects 100+ days far, let alone totally unknown possibilities pike. US also many people initial categories heart/diabetic/respiratory issues would think everyone ought taking way seriously. wonder figures compare Europe. #MothersAgainstCanada /s China increased PPE production 12x initial lockdown, gone since then. 

US anything initial lockdown. Critikal says: Florida massive conspiracy devil house world's dumbest people see would happen live Texas boyfriend lives Vancouver. Haven’t seen months either. understand borders closed it’s heartbreaking families directly affected. Nope. /'Murica Certain groups like Asians America still smartest kids class lol waiting next year? drove First Nations person outskirts city winter left there. lol Canada silly That's America amazing country.

Percentage population infected United States

300 ÷ 40,000 = 0.75%

Percentage population infected Wuhan

5÷1100=0.45%

What's happening America right Wuhan February, bigger worse

And dare America still traffic jams, worthy America no.1 Fuck going lmaoo good thing experience applies world large. know, mom beat cancer, maybe cancers really big deal either? Speculation best, Vegas one final places close last time. entire US would shut again. Oxford vaccine furthest along goal 1 million doses September. must really important think you’ll getting one soon. uncaring, unsympathetic, asshole response Best luck us vaccine gets us quickly. 

Worst case situation, *can* still fly in. little loophole: Canadians fly stay 180 days normal. can't drive. think laws says "" wearing mask? Work volunteer hospital"", people wear mask then... Mexican here, México ain't shit, president AMLO already said never close border guess what? live border town get thousands americans also top 3 infected city Mexico, goverment fucking nothing.  Trump right claim credit Probable usually means antibody positive, make sure person ever mentions immediately discount whatever says lol 81%? Build wall make America pay it! think meant xenophobic. saying agree him. wait till Mexico build wall keep COVID19 out.

Who's going enforce rule? Even sheriffs refused enforce it. Yeah, stable warp speed out. hope people defend right WEAR face masks facial recognition becomes huge threat privacy freedoms.

If they’re going pitch fit freedom this, sure fuck better pitch fit freedom WEAR masks public over.

So telling me, Bill Gates know better epidemic subject experienced recognized man earth subject ? blind stupid ? detecting baseline vital changes indicative illness, malaise infection specific Covid19. can't really say ""We usually predict COVID-19 well symptoms using smartwatches"" that's incorrect omission. changes well documented numerous studies many acute illnesses common flu. fan generalizing whole country's population, maybe that's me. freaking telling stop taking specially pandemic crisis going !! started taking last week !! things I've heard, many fled China fall semester things bad there, left spring semester, many Americans (and even nationalities) can't get back in.  fine. grandmas already gone what's problem? inactived virus Chinese vaccine started 12-month phase 3 trial Brazil. found safe effective year now, would opposed taking one rushed Indian Independence Day Aug 15. Lies. official 2021 inauguration. [REDACTED] wins, notification gets ripped up. Vote. I'm confused too. Take upvote. worried, also work school there's really good chance everyone school already it, think fast colds spread school. paranoid. let things take course trust god believe one. otherwise work school ran turd polish back 2017. guys upvote new version headline every single day, what's that?

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  find interesting reading. Western Europe sadly every nation failed contain virus.

USA however nation planet besides Iran continued fail half year now. protests started end may increase cases started middle june, everywhere. think Florida Man office afraid Florida Man might turn finds Florida Hospitals filled sick Florida Man already. know amputation. That's civil war era shit....you'll 100% die this...buuut might also die anyway ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

PEOPLE...wear fucking mask. aware this, surprise me

Hulk Hogan truly garbage person wish sarcasm would disappear like miracle. Toughen buttercup spend 8 hours working hot kitchen. gets hot days, like 40 degrees (which hot west coast Canadian). 

I wear mask shift remove drink water every often.

 problem. felt like breathing enough oxygen. gotten headache breathing co2. 

However dehydration headache, solve drink water. totally funny 88% people think dihydrogen monoxide banned schools. fuck cares stupid public thinks. axe bet it. anything hide truth. They're currently ransacking Hong Kong universities destroying text books CCP friendly. Scary times. We've completely lost control virus point us own. us safeguard health. government neighbors going shit.

Everyone's priority one STAY HEALTHY. Well guess must know Dr Fauci Well shit—France?

I’ve seen crazy Karens going US, physical violence? Causing brain death? FRANCE? Shit officially hitting fan! Getting votes tired boring comment us live China know reporting accurate be. ignorant people would refuse believe stage. want don't.

Ah yes, go-to line can't provide source want admit wrong. \+orange want talk ppe? Fucking morons. actually agree trump cutting ties He’s dumb, shit purpose.
See happened people underestimated him. Good. Without US 400 million dollars annually ‘do nothing’ organization cease exist Predictions always 100% correct. Concrete evidence thus far supports Swedish narrative well.

When/if 2nd wave hits Sweden larger herd immunity threshold built Denmark forced close again, we'll see happens :) Melbourne largest city Australia? Kinda like how.... NYC largest city US....? hadn’t already expected Washington California first cases due Chinese populations travel patterns China, probably wouldn’t even known infection New York spiked.....

🤔 even asymptotic people end lung damage. hospital already collapsing gonna moving patients places, sad no, still shitty bad faith (or Greece got cold feet journalists waited them, knows).

But deals made international business level, OP try hardest spin ""those Swedes lies sneaks people Greece"". Yes, that's using word ""reprieve"", implies temporary.

So assume we're agreement. know democratic socialist social democrat right?
Something tells don't... vice versa death toll go line increase infections. there's lag 2 6 weeks. People hospitalized Covid-19 address usually hospital least 2 weeks. Many month. 2 months.... much time spent ICU. 

The deaths *really* kick ICUs full people just.....die. happened Italy Spain infections got far ahead health care system's capacity. would say patient meant evaluated ICU admission without assessment doctor? Communism 1 - 0 Coronavirus power grab little guys lose again. let history repeat Florida’s approach caving right Brasíl’s president cover image? power grab little guys lose again. let history repeat People wearing glasses sunglasses: sanitize without destroying lenses/frame coating (as suppose alcohol would do)? mean, know saying. worked f&amp;b. could individuals dining getting infected? another activity specifically well-suited spreading COVID people gathering together restaurant people gathering together EAT? 

like, someone restaurant industry, can't believe low ""dining restaurant"" risk assessment charts when, me, high risk gets. Melbourne only, seasons nothing it. Tasmania, New South Wales, South Australia cold Melbourne winter cases. freezing live NZ single local case 68 days. zero restrictions, mask wearing social distancing here. 

Coronaviruses show seasonality Flu, difference summer makes people spending little less time inside together. Oh man, yeah people going like came across. know mean well that's lot people's relatives shamed.  like spew conspiracy dribble mistake argument. Go swallow Hydroxychloriquine, simp. giving shit bankers predict health crisis? Great. Dumb Dutch teenagers going party Portugal. really hope cause second wave. Portugal already put local lockdowns place. least half articles refer patients turned back ICUs hospitals, residents elderly homes get individual assessment doctor. two different issues different responsible parties behind them. third patients third deaths? deaths, source please? age groups broken down, preferably.

And must okay increased suicides, homicides, poverty related deaths, deaths diseases interested locking virus goes extinct. guess death cult vs yours?

By way, lockdowns meant flatten curve, successful places unnecessary even many places. There's advantage continuing lock down. Would airborne transmission make masks useless? mean, see Sweden success high death toll.  
But mistake made past, living consequences mistake clearing situation better many would expected.  
Just yesterday SvD wrote economical forecast well, according numbers, Poland Denmark get better crisis Sweden:  ""PROTECT"" serve... looks like missed classes. Morons spit on

you really need check sources man.
There ongoing healthy debate since March. One heavily invested part says spit protesting change that. set painting worst possible picture, grasping straws it? doesn’t make sense, “good chance” everyone school it. spreading misinformation based made head Nevada well although recent. Also slaughterhouses poor ventilation Well rate thing would prevent 60-65K testing limits. 56K per day already means massive amount daily testing since quarter people get tested currently get positive result.

You'd wonder much increase testing. Bad bot. Every comment purely political. Wow didn’t expect negs haha. Well, Chinese 25%, largest. Guess country 2nd? India. Indian Chinese alike? 3rd Philippine. It’s easier distinguish Filipinos Chinese. Japanese, Koreans Vietnamese combined counted 5%. group Chinese look alike. probability explains. Damn, guess didn’t read article foreign doctor working Vietnam verified it. fact US CDC also verified it. 369 cases info released public, like patient 91 recovered two months life support.

But cases China, knows happened number 54,875. 37,259...  Godspeed stomach individual takes vitamin C high doses zinc. third victims 40, even 70, saying need risk people's lives economy starts. Nevermind many deaths already negatively impact economy (you can't wipe many consumers once). Nevermind opening swamp hospitals, meaning alot people without virus die. Nevermind .2% (which certainly nowhere near reliable) still means roughly 660,000 people dead, excess mortality btw, top everything else. 

That okay many people dying economy means death cult. almost exactly train thought caused leave military service last year. can't serve man, regard human life idea lawful order even is. socialist actually

You know look comment history, right? know it’s easy believe bad things happening larger reason vast conspiracy here, regular power grabs stupidity matters lot less modernity given small world gotten. Also 1/3 world shares power equally could spread geographically? There's enough space. Eh failure China pointing didn’t act properly beginning. 
Hence, allowing spread world. Vancouver Island here. don’t want mainlanders come us, nevermind gross Americans.

(Disclaimer: gross American 4 years PR far, best blend plans ever go back. Fuckin eh right bud.) Let’s put zombie talk. zombies broken complex rates increasing exponentially everything control used /s. thought obvious. Cant say blame them. “Some casinos check temperatures door; others don’t. do, techniques vary. I’ve checked five different ways.”

The casinos using rectal thermometers well. Falling? trippled today Trump done entire year downplay threat. 

Would better position hadn’t said word, positive negative pandemic let staff handle it? Part fun gambling. 

""Hey Buddy, Let's go Vegas. Bet $100 open?"" ""You're on! Let's go!"" Calm down. wouldn’t want see Florida cars Ohio right now, much less BC. quantify full recoveries? You’ve recovered you’ve lost significant lung capacity. recovered stroke rehab that. don’t think really accurate number trust politicians give us accurate number. Speaking Brazil, tho wish anyone catch Covid-19 maybe since Bolsonaro tested positive it'll change things little. imagine would happen Trump tested positive... Nationally, yes. sure NY alone hat  Thank you. 

We keep saying ""shitty officials elected shitty constituencies"" like electoral system compromised hell. 

End gerrymandering. End Electoral College. Make day on-site voter registration &amp; ranked-choice voting universal. See fast incompetents lose jobs. That's spend 5 minutes day more. depressing take away valid point dont casinos godlike ventilation? People chainsmoke day night dont notice all. corresponding spike Minneapolis New York Chicago? Ah, downplay cover eyes technique. go... suppose also take account error introduced way people wear devices, ""innate"" inaccuracies devices...

Great start though sure. admire people like effort stem spread covid-19 watch hospitalizations. Really hope starts go again. :( (L.A. Great attitude. proud Canada! residual scores elevated resting heart rate built p-value significance, easy summarize value like traditional stats since every person tuned personally. notice individuals asthma / respiratory diseases harder predict however. Feel kid sympathy parents known better. ego killed kid. American here, agree honestly think we've earned ""respectfully."" We’re trying, cards haven’t really favor recently Suck dick worthless dog Agree. US supposed rich powerful country. Lol explain Taiwan, South Korea, Singapore. They’re also “saving face” culture. You’re ridiculous. fall two categories ....which scares hell me! cautious limit social media especially sub stress .I’m shape 37 year old cleared 8 days bad it’s death sentence Could subhuman lumps shit like quit polluting world walk fucking window? Please? would instantly contribute benefit world way ever could otherwise Ok, explain Sweden did, you, time would able say stupid. 

Don’t use hindsight arguments. trouble Republicans disagreed severity Covid-19 never allowed State properly execute. leadership ready willing lead, unfortunately, people willing follow. Call fool want daily deaths pretty par daily new cases think numbers lack testing simply actions took relation Covid-19. Seeing constant headlines like makes reeeeal bitter pay taxes. always thought started highschool went graduate school becoming interns Yeah, yeah, hundreds millions cases China, tens millions people fevers, countless cases flood hospitals China qiushengy....

Hey, hospitals China flooded?

It's strange phenomenon, it? American, would wise suggest looking alpha-GPC! form choline higher bioavailability also considered nootropics. :) Government constant battle equality freedom. equal societies less incentive produce. 

In free societies top producers reap rewards best. Develop competitive advantages.

Corruption poisons systems.

It’s fairly cyclical produces visible trends. totally agree. However, police neither manpower goodwill perform task. enter private security commissioned non-commissioned, big guy back retail workers shield misplaced outrage would end better long run. Plus would add least *some* job opportunity. currently security guard know possibility getting shot hired. key worldwide. Many poor nations means testing. 5-10x seems reasonable USA. “I think word means think means.” Ofc we're also half way immunity, fear second wave cooler fall weather low.

TIL Sweden population 200,000! Airborne equal droplets. true, would mean aerosol transmission, would render established protocols ineffective. thought case pandemic lol  We’re trying look that. Similar patterns apply flu know detecting COVID-19 here. distinguishing challenging. dozens flu cases reported, didn’t enough overlap data address phase 1. Getting complete wearable data, complete surveys, complete test results truly trust lot harder might believe. opinion give folks reason fear us support wearing masks.

Vote out. funny comment I'm Canadian 110% favour keeping border closed. 

The compassionate view huge amount economy based trade America. unreasonable imagine large portion 19% entitled ""Karens"" normal people scared know border closure going cost job/business. First world countries refers countries aligned USA cold war put absolutely *certain* *must* leave... right everyone else same. never forget line bumper bumper traffic heading North I-59 Katrina evacuation... seeing nearly 2hrs North New Orleans. believe corona bad, around 3/4x worse flu also believe there’s going protecting public health. Never let good crisis go waste Swedes say fine.

As long Swedes leave country, problem it, feel like it. long game discrediting Hillary Clinton began July 1992, &amp; Bill first appeared national stage Republican operatives suspected smarter Bill she’d make political moves eventually. 

Of course today, GOP’s brain trust isn’t canny. they’ll always fall back old reliable tactics putting teachers suppressing popular vote. lie once, can't surprised people wish taken fool second time. Maybe Fauci needs hear story boy cried wolf?

the NiH also published would known since 2005 least previous SARs causing Coronavirus ininhibited chloroquine. Since he's taking previous coronavirus antibody production results gospel novel virus maybe could extended leniency busy predicting HCQ useless :) people coming conclusion bureaucrat that's survived 30 years regime changes charlatan. ""I'm jacked Mountain Dew!"" 52 today’s reported deaths [death certificate meaning 117 died overnight Yes, possible involves deep knowledge brief understanding good strategy. It’s cool. us sane smart/empathetic enough know don’t want guys suffering we’re dealing right now. It’s really joke 130,000 people dead realize you’re possibly next. Seeing daily numbers, reminds tge great War Indy Neidel. even similar time span rental cars US plates maybe? rental car Ontario plates, guy yell go back country. 

20 miles home states. Fortunately polls show base enough get reelected. predict outbreaks, too. Look large groups gathering. [has equally approved source look daily case rate Germany, Italy, America India. Germany Italy strict lockdown, basically stopped virus.

How skip death counts interesting. Let us compare many people died places? 
For population had, number wad ridiculously high. notice something here. CFR Corona supposed less 1 percent, means multiply 100 number deaths get fair picture number cases. Germany's death rate unbelievably low, reports count comorbidity covid death,m

This one point good enough prove clearly get demographics comparing countries population typical Indian states India itself. 

Only exception US, deaths paint far different picture. many people died, many people must proportionately gotten infected. Indian government said year food supply locked down. Based that, India could locked longer getting results

This nonsense argument. Correction: food supplies 3 years told lol. supplied doenst mean reach needs to. remain strict lockdown, go anywhere, lots lots restricted movement. Supply chain gets affected. expected continue rising steadily India. Experts advising federal government say authorities prioritise reducing mortality containing spread virus.""

That's point lockdown. prepare better virus. increase healthcare among things, done well many places across India. 

You want draw comparisons, compare state like TN sat Germany France Italy. compare India them. 

If realise even now, best comparison India would US sense likely plateau different states peaking different times. sound american eh? sorry idea mean mostly psychological. People breathe mouths slightly slower mask say OMG I'm dying. go online course find Bullshit confirming looking for. Ich calm take deep breaths nose works pretty well ! thought right? Florida already hitting capacity

My parents live FL, they're careful, entire state seems war citizens Well *world* health organisation also know someone fully asymptomatic, knows got nurse got antibody test later. never developed symptoms, felt quite tired times, attributed stress working hospital pandemic. never noticed significant drop physical performance. What’s free president going television wearing mask urging idiot supporters also wear masks. 

The expensive part building time machine make said speech back would possibly contained thing. terrifying, especially kids. Holiday weekend factor soon. 

Deapite media unable state seen countless selfies social media feed Americans taking selfies masks hugging strangers masks congratulate wearing masks. 

Cloth masks fucking hazmat suits fuck sakes people. allow 90% particle transmission conversational scenarios. Keep social distancing dumb dumb people.

Here Canada zero community spread cases 20 days. mask policy less 10% people.wesr them. 

The US greatly dangerously overstating effiency cloth masks. happens make issue political. Could something simple delay reporting due long weekend. Numbers steadily declining, interesting watch next week. dude talking whole time. Look graphs on, say, worldometer.com mean asthma take salbutamol every day, feel fine masks. mean someone else might problems wearing masks long periods time. No, can’t project deaths raw case counts. ages.   I've found enormous survival value caring whether look stupid. 

That's true lot life, really, especially now. value life US Sweden. course US catastrophe compared Sweden. 

Also, Sweden don’t excess mortality anymore. don’t think place curve. That’s shitty them. can’t imagine living state like that. Even mask mandate, vast majority people wearing masks many/most businesses required them. keep saying evidence children spread coronavirus like colds flus, that’s we’ve locked since start dumb fks Fauci right. Infections rocketing. Deaths lag infections 2-6 weeks. real crunch comes ICU beds full people die.... Like Spain Italy ICU beds filled. 

The infection rate still rising. know keep going said go ahead swallow simp poison. Israel fully reopened schools late spring shut two weeks, hundreds students school employees tested positive virus. One biggest issues teachers bring safety event person tests positive virus school, said Khem Irby, school board member Guilford County Schools North Carolina — state's third-largest ""What mean?"" asked Irby, also president national advocacy group, Parents Across America. ""Does whole school close? everyone 14-day quarantine? haven’t heard protocol yet."" pieces evidence enough make definitive conclusion. Think fact virus world. People contracting disease tens hundreds thousands every day. always anomalies anecdotes may may representative virus overall. plural anecdote data, can't assume anything true without sufficient weight evidence behind many different forms (experiment, contact tracing data, mathematical modeling, etc.). Thank you! read work. lockdowns cause cancer heart disease (the two largest causes natural death)? Heart disease claimed 647,000 people, cancer 606k. jump 50% each? 

Maybe referring lockdownitis mystery killer kill 600k people mysterious reasons? 

Throughout whole thread offered zero proof claims, asserting article wrong right. explain death rate overall going jump 20% last year, exactly lockdownitis works reality. try joining teachers union. god used teach admin told union try protect u circumstances Trust government bad thing. Sweden, working democracy, political independent investigations situation handled. Honestly, “agree” quarantine; question welcome back anyway. putting child - recent preemie going far susceptible complications - risk vacation. Don’t let chance go see character priorities clearly pass by. necessarily withheld, lot teached history. learn unless look (which thankful easier nowadays due easy internet acess).

If kind information widespread maybe would would better responses threats similar past.

Before heard Spanish flu idea caused H1N1, happend WW1 spread helped quarantines lockdowns. want point Interview German regional politician said:
""Wir haben Menschen den vergangenen Wochen allein sterben lassen, ohne Begleitung, ohne Trost. Das war würdelos, auch wenn es uns alternativlos erschien."" (""We let people die alone past weeks, without accompaniment, without comfort. undignified, even seemed us without Ramelow Left politician head state Thuringia Germany. whole interview quite interesting, shows humane mindset there. understand German, Translate via Google quite ok :) end world know it. Well least USA. kid 40 odd years ago. used chant school. ""Get way. Get way. came back USA."" I'm quite sure pushing people countries around coming close end USA. think question asker looking something along lines use available case data calculate R0. say, instance, state R0 1.74, data drives calculation somebody please think children! Okay, nitpick: 21.48 million people Florida, per Google. 1 100 214,800 people. 3,841/214,800 = 1.78%, considerably lower projections used justify lock lifestyle changes, numbers based confirmed cases, know full number cases know that, least, asymptomatic cases asymptomatic people unlikely get tested. cant help feel like whether year 4 years, whoever takes fool going spend entire term, either 4 8 years, recouping damage losses presidency. go hated president harsh measures they'll take fix foolishness. 

America i'm sorry really, really dirty man took office even he's long road ahead fix what's done country, reputation populace. Alright I'll get technical.

R0 represent average number people infected person infect. R0=1 exactly, infected person infect one person. number infection remain same, neither increasing decrease (each patent either recover die, cause one infection).

At R0=2, infected person infect average 2 people. Thus generation infection number infected double. Average generation time COVID-19 5 days. R0=2 based characteristics COVID-19, single infected person cause something like 250 million infected 3 million dead 200 days assuming intervention population 328 million, power exponential growth.

COVID-19 R0 countermeasure place anywhere 2 6.

Here's simulation play gone whole childhood teenage years never getting chicken pox. Made sure get vaccine came turned 18 Education expensive US.

Knowledge product US. frank, everyone world receive information WHO. whether citizen government took action, makes difference.

take malaysia example, beginning (march) 15k people gathering thousand got infected. i'd say day malaysians playing field US, thousands infection start up.

Government announced lock right away 15 march, body get house, police, doctors, nurses, essential workers, worked hard. sure always stupid defied law, government sent armies patrol road, set road blocks ensure travels spreading minimum.

and know what's fascinating ? politicians shut up. 

Health DPT voice hear listen to. came conclusion, look countries succeeded defending virus (at time, china), wear mask, wash hand, stay home. Government gives help small businesses, banks delayed loan payment, subsidies workers etc etc.

WHO entity wrong, country health division. citizens need mind think what's best community.

But apparently US think it'll cool defy everything that's right, Couple american's weird fetish exactly opposite one that's successfully defended virus, i.e china. guys great recipe catastrophic disaster. ""The Barn"" still operation? think herd immunity requires closer 90 - 95% immune can't compare? one mentioned America first. So, logic, 9/11 hoax! yay police state 2020, beginning Idiocracy real life. quite extensive process. technically GHB breaks second hits stomach easier skip intro lol. know take anxiety, makes mine worse anything lowest level. first month like clouds parted fully awake human again. Now, much drastic improvement before. Narcolepsy causes problems sleep cycle would literally never get deep restorative sleep truly treatment available right actually alleviates issue rather stimulating power through. long Swedes leave country

The Swedes cry foul fact may leave country. Model launch isn’t going well

then come tesla sold cars expected Q2? Need leads advancement.

The progress made year regards fighting viruses medication lungs decade work normal times. You’d surprised many people end lives want wedding guys really interest besmirching blm. Funny, see comments history castigating clowns protesting reopen. state amount people, Hamburg. 1,8 million people, population density 6,500/sq mi since city state. Idaho according Wikipedia around 22/sq. Hamburg registered 6 new cases yesterday, 5228 cases overall. we're also half way immunity

Might want check math there, 50,000 cases day would take 200 days 334 million people currently living US

At 3 million cases currently, less 1% way world even ""repair"" small countries like syria Iraq, collapsing USA helped ? think would mercy, simply much world do.

Especially consider economies world depend growth US, germany china exporting goods US, US consumer afford them, local consumers can't.

If US going down, everyone take damage. hope world leaders would gladly accept economy tanking, pose ""strong man"" front selected audiences.

On issue banning people, well think plain necessary. EU would like come, americans pose serious health risk.

I think average american tourist visiting france spends $1000 there, factor costs 14 day quarantine possible medical treatment, well worth it. There's plenty things criticize Swedish method comment ""herd immunity""

Herd immunity never strategy swedish approach. Anders Tegnell (Sweden's chief epidemiologists) said interview way rid virus vaccin herd immunity. statement lazily used various media outlets show Sweden going for.

The swedish approach make sure restricions population sustainable long period time, healthcare systems collapse. That's basically it! right wrong strategy another question, herd immunity never goal.

Also, visits elderly care homes banned quite time. government rather slow demanding it, facilities put ban effect government ordered it. Good. Good. brainwashed zombie Dumb dickhead definitely doubling girl unluck world, largest one parents. Sad. good. communist propaganda organization call bullshit.

The way calculate positivity rate correct anyway. divide number people tested positive number tests done. Since 1 person get multiple tests, make sense.  Waiting see virus actually gone dormant ""recovered"" people, wake sometime future kill instantly. individuals lots businesses supportive. Ironically, institutions designed specifically veterans seem lukewarm best towards them. fries good eat immediately argument people dying arent ones heavily contributing economy anyway hr lady called say time go back in. one wears masks office. said comfortable next another cubicle asked computers face other. literally half wall us would matter way face lol. fired going back in. I'd rather unemployed spend every day risky situation like that. guess explains no-face mask movement. Meanwhile, every re***lican country trashing NY response.

America never able overcome anything 1/3 fucking citizens care facts. life worth little discomfort, lady. see mean ""everything works should"" perspective billionaires. I'm sorry situation, grateful using try warn/protect people. Thank you. wish peace times, can't mentally easy all.

Is ghb prescribed you? taken anxiety sleep before, legally acquired. hands greatest medicine I've ever tried anxiety sleep. China glowing reputation transparent, like tried hide outbreak doctors definitely didn’t die... chewing tobacco spit. 

Now cigarette smoke. Tabarnac! ^^^Is ^^^a ^^^word ^^^I've ^^^heard ^^^is ^^^appropriate ^^^these ^^^situations. Fuck America. I'm never going again.  American here, Canada, blame Cat bath time! I'll get Band-Aids. \~1500 per day weeks ago. days, &lt;1000 per day. yeah, improving – quite possibly infecting younger people, higher chances surviving it.

Now, catch even survive, mess lungs, brain, circulatory system ways may never recover. numbers much harder detect measure than, well, death.

So, better survival rate good. even death rate somehow ended lower flu, fight over. disagree.

Masks much available accessible us trouble shot troubleshooting finding face covering works.

I tired getting lumped anti-mask people. I'm staying home much can, I'm wearing mask much can, anti-mask people certainly seem care die. Aussie watching fall Victorians bolting borders borders closed spreading NSW ACT, hell yeah, keep fuck closed.  Yep cast-iron denial begins clear airborne. way droplet transmission would spread fast 21st Century. Us funds around 12% cina barely 1%. Bill Gates trow almost much US! 

http://open.who.int/2020-21/contributors/contributor he’s probably playing someone thinks solitare Yesterday 300, today US reported 1000. That's ment cares? You? you? That's right, like getting 60 test finding people got 20 30. Florida opened beaches they’re gonna really mad cases spike 

Their governor really dumb won’t take blame people die 

Y’all wanna go back work go get infected working best buy

To conspiracy people men women numbers lie 

Roooooo-naaaaa! Rooooo-naaaa! even talking about? huge difference 20% vs 50% population immunity, even 20%! suggest matter percentage dropping comment ""halfway there"" remark makes zero sense. throwing random claims make feel better? Maybe held cash till working vaccine actually developed EU locked im correct.

So watching strange tv show Trump quizmaster Europe atm. I'm literally sleeping broken bed shit happens. mood already iffy, entire thing people country make bash head wall something. would explain people weird moment foreigner living Sweden nine months, closely watched responses statistics two countries due personal affiliations, say Swedish people general put astronomical level trust government. much many observed Swedish media only, discarding non-Swedish media outlets proposing arguments counter Swedish government (and remember English literacy high country). Swedish people this. Even many foreigners (naturalized expatriates) came justifications as: *the government knows best decide fine go out, wear masks, lock down, go restaurants/bars, go schools gyms, etc., I'll follow lines. rest world decides take completely different course action*. 

Nevertheless, despite mistakes made country government people 4-5 months, many big small companies forced shut regular activities face economic consequences pandemic. agree article says Sweden got nothing approach; lot lives lost, economy saw damages countries. 

Finally, believe article read Guardian time ago got right: "" country experienced national emergency crisis 100 years ""... "" lack experience handling national crises goes way explaining technocratic dispassionate outlook Covid-19, opposed sense urgency"".

 Yes, group infection restaurant matches airflow AC, quite solid evidence aerosol transmission. I'll ask kindly tell folks same. commented another thread day every time drive small US border town live near, every store Quebec (and fair, Ontario) plates parking lot.

Not ton cases point, folks bringing back may likely rogue American jumping across.

But since we're here, meet middle St. Lawrence exchange poutine? tell want return. I'm American birth wife Montreal. married keep poutine supply flowing screwing plans. title miss leading. sueing money split written bill. based low income students per school. Devos changed rules favor private schools. look long every curve around world, including New York state taken ""come back mountain"" (stolen Andrew Cuomo) worried America.
I'm British can't believe see happening there. 
From quote along understand someone even live country, Governor Cuomo spoken clear message facts I've respected approach. 
Trump hand... put country shame remember back february literally every person sub said incompetent mafia.

Now everybody acts never said lol.
(I mean go back february/january watch Postings lot bad is, also r/china_flu role r/coronavirus back then) following /r/COVID19 past months, would seen papers journals released say airborne, others saying isn't.

Is *really* obvious, remember prominent paper sub many hundreds upvotes virologists stating something like ""If air borne would seeing many infections..."" etc think everyone everywhere feels way tbh. Keep borders closed everywhere calms bit. Travelling right senseless (unless absolutely necessary). 
As Brit, can't believe we're allowed go Italy, Spain, France...talk senseless. Well, americas fucked U places. friends stated renting beach houses end this, moved entire family Caribbean. concern lack resources like resturants alcohol shops. Cant imagine much spending, seems concerned one kids private school schedule fall. Actually studies show smokers less half likely serious even moderate cases Covid-19, 50% lower chance (per whatever age demographic) die well.

To clear: smoking NICOTINE seems beneficial. VA, France, Scotland, Germany currently research figure smokers underrepresented illness/death.

The know. ... she’s Typhoid Mary. That’s troll. She’s invested spreading disease. kind rise wish stock market, yet right state cases. Cursed graph right there. lucky. Trump supporting district they're opening back snowflakes get out. main argument ""can't make people buy Internet. constitutional rights wear masks."" 

Our children go day packed buses packed classrooms. governor gave ""suggestions"" keep liability. Districts total control. low death rate? resolved cases death rate USA 9 %. count people got recently infected still struggling (or struggling) desease ""survivors"" get lower death count, using wrong numbers.

Other countries similar low death rate infections growing exponential. cases countries resolved, see whole picture.  someone teacher parent, thank reaching reject this. know lot parents tough spot right forced work. 

It's atrocious way government using virus pit needs other; cause know want schools open parents less excuse go back work. 

I hope refuse. refuse, can't stop us. government launched first attack Karen’s spliff day keeps doctor away.  wouldn’t read much Tom Brittons models. far pandemic models haven’t really correlated reality. Im saying wrong unlikely Germanies finest trained find virus infected people cost lives. dogs better get infected. tax done it.

There's probably small effect improved treatment, small effect treating people earlier, unknown/variable effect high-risk people staying home and/or protecting nursing homes bit better (it better February/March people almost nothing, right?) ... looking USA went R=1 circa early June expect reported deaths (lag deaths \~1 week) increase 1st 2nd week July. Thanks sharing! I’m curious, reading research article published back April medical literature talking saturated fat diets addition sugar standard American diet main cause neurological disorder side effects.

The whole situation going blow up. know kids cesspool diseases. Opening lead ""flare ups.""

I miss real fucking leadership. Trump moron.. like House Cards. Agreed terribly real life got much worse. know do. Post angry rant reddit nothing else Sure, that's goal. Achievable not. Harding made clear going hurried neighbours releasing apps, telling committee ""it's something think anyone world got working high enough standard yet"".

The virus making exceptions. really dictates peoples fear seen outside dining in, loitering, going beach. lot work mostly leisure enjoyment, know aint afraid virus. Anti-maskers, US got em, braid dead karens dime dozen, many more. Point lot still dont see virus threat, see potential threat brings, clearly many dont see 130k deaths anything. Waaaah... argument truth makes sad waaah case, whole school used - empty building already set schooling - can't another school use space order halve amount students locations? thought.  


I agree reopening definitely kids/parents NEED kids school one reason another. Trying figure safest way accommodate that; options table. K. Waggoner, general counsel Alliance Defending Freedom, conservative religious-liberty group brought Nevada lawsuit challenged state restrictions religious gatherings. said vast majority churches meet exceed federal health guidelines reopening.

If last sentence true, infections spiked anyway, Kristen ADF need seriously reconsider position drop lawsuits. delusional expectation. Sports ain't gonna happen. ...im shock point.

Afternoon 08/07/2020, Beijing held 145th COVID-19 pandemic prevention update press conference. Beijing CDC Deputy Chief Pang Xinghuo updates following info:

07/07/2020 00:00 24:00, Beijing new confirmed suspected cases, thus resulting two days zero new confirmed cases. Upto 24:00 07/07/2020, Xinfadi Market outbreak resulted 29 infection clusters totalling 127 confirmed cases asymptomatic carriers. those, 13 family clusters involving 36 individuals, 2 public space clusters involving 4 individials, 8 work place clusters involving 29 individuals, plus food service clusters Xicheng Square, Beishui Jialun Market Old Zhengzhou Braised Noodle Restaurant. Apart these, 6 clusters (58 individauls) involve one location (a mix work, home, public space, market). example cluster No. 1 Ci Wei Road, Suncunxiang, Daxing District cluster Mian Mian Ju Dao Restaurant, included work family cluster. I'm fine section planet. Maybe USA? government gets lot stick, surely fair enough drop something they're sure it'll work rather spend tens millions fail?

 people using across world. become apparent good using it🌍 kill teachers poor kids only? That's somehow better? argument keep seeing good compromise? really believe current administration sees deaths release economic burdens. Every nursing home resident, VA hospital patient, disabled person, person underlying disease financial drain system. 
Note--I say person rare autoimmune disease costs small fortune medicate. also drain. Realistically, death would free lot resources. Edibles beautiful thing ;) know historical levels comparison? wasn’t soon, right way. Fauci right nothing thinking this. can’t open exact way, need make minor lifestyle adjustments like moving bars street, taking fitness classes parks, going church, etc. think shutdowns harmful virus, need little bit smarter open up. already told school district think stupid reopen kids going back; prefer distance learning year. cannot count kids keep mask on/practice good hygiene time. Even adults screw time time. offering hybrid model schools insist something in-person individuals really need kids school one reason another. 

I told kids want going school year go school next year. replying said. say we’re fucking superpower. I’m responding to. need step real world America (yes greatest country) hold esteem had. several EU countries opened schools little effect infection rate? might solution homeless regular poor families, maybe they'd like choice live instead concentrating one area. Maybe want live public housing building. 

This obviously huge inefficiency system opposed seizing property, know feasible right climate. see vouchers help landlords though good point. prefer vouchers public housing families want give kids chance live different neighborhood, maybe even suburbs, instead concentrating would basically minorities one urban area, kind happened banks started giving mortgages white people let buy houses suburbs. perpetuated weird dynamic. Maybe good. lmao! According healthcare friends mine, care protocols improved slightly well sso guessing 'time die' creeping up. maybe 3-4 weeks instead '2ish'. denomination set much like US, governing board decision makers elected congregation. people people sort thing. 

We live Florida. 

As pastor, vote. almost reopened three weeks ago, spike. I’m so, grateful didn’t. installed new church, pastors stand congregation and, among vows, promise care love flock. keeping doors closed, that. One world’s first mass coronavirus outbreaks occurred secretive South Korean church.

This floors me. well known problem far advance. know everyone ignoring wants go church. isn’t attack religion person’s right go church. literally respiratory illnesses spread best environment church creates. Guess what? Movie theatres bad. gyms. Guess what’s even worse? Bars. Concerts.

So one singling anyone group.  I’m going data three years ago initially said go away ""as magic"", said 25, thereafter stuck pretending either happening, already nicest hotels city right beside rink doubt issue leaders one many symptoms. occasional opinion piece something expected. barely non-Swedish media seems want push deeper Swedish corona strategy herd immunity claim FHM going for. quite tiresome see lazy reporting showing normally reputable sources. Thanks, thinking LA Exactly. That's scientists trying relay CDC. Tl;dr: THC anti inflammatory, prevents inflammation usually caused lung disease 100% mice. time cases rising multiple states. Even rise high New York state, total could become high still.

Heck, New York population 8.4 million.

Arizona 7.3 million, Florida 21.5 million Texas 29 million

If new infections quarter New York earlier, USA could huge spike deaths well. know next 2 4 4 weeks. Administrators refuse discipline students, 

Oh yeah strangers putting hands kids totally fine. Let go punch kids right face :D Thanks proving liar. approach ""let's get get with"" short-sighted guarantee pay years decades now.

This. much this. guess leaders generally decided they’ll power dead time chickens come home roost, decided roll dice short term gains long term outcomes.

(Plot twist, short term gains! leaders still get away murder.) economic fallout impact entire globe. That's thing. Trump endorses vaccine intense cognitive dissonance? i'm american, somebody ELI5 dufus, bumblebee, complete idiot moron evident IQ shortage way relevant american culture? people (about 80%) recover disease without needing special treatment, majority – especially children young adults – illness due COVID-19 generally minor.

However, people cause serious illness. Around 1 every 5 people infected COVID-19 develop difficulty breathing require hospital care. suppose we'll see soon enough; they're trying reopen school speak. time consider calling local officials telling open schools. can't undo Sandy Hook, still time stop this. always still are? achieved much collectively change fact biologically still quite primitive. ever forget that.

People realize there's difference 100% capacity every hospital metro area forced operate surge capacity weeks minimum. Probably closer months. Leading right flu season again.

Then we're gonna problems finding travel nurses states getting slammed too. one good ones. Yeah? Well that’s like, opinion, man. Herd immunity consequence virus existing. It’s quite literally way goes away. Either get herd immunity infection vaccine. 

Herd immunity isn’t strategy. It’s inevitable endpoint virus.  federal passports, I've never heard anyone say one according internet 40 percent us them.

I feeling people passports often ones mandatory federal ids. suspicion might overlap people think masks infringement rights total conjecture. makes sense though lot Americans hate anything see big government.

There's also think Americans simply feel enough money travel internationally interest passports. OK, here's 7-day moving average changed week-over-week:

\-23% (5 weeks ago) 
\-12% 
\-14% 
\-8% 
\+6% (this week)

This probably first week long time reported deaths week (not including states added bunch missing data). 4.4% - that's much lower thought. also lives western country less racist US. still faced lot racism pandemic appeal fear Wow daily case rates went cliff last week June. Huge fast drop. Good job! takes weeks initial spike cases, cases becomes serious enough end death. death numbers tend trail behind case numbers. makes sick stomach someone arguing - taking care children tenth thing list priorities.

But regardless, repeatedly claiming human human transmission weeks Jan 22 retracting comments asymptomatic spread day later, claiming didn’t actually didn’t recommend masks public June 8th denying airborne spread - Yep. Notice “it’ll gone summer” people Homer Simpsoned bushes? Covid related. Let's hope. Listening cosmologist's personal opinion Fermi Paradox highly interesting completely different situation. implying education professional commitment removes individual right free speech. comes life death, one cannot rule another basis personal conviction. Corporate interests rife normal circumstances Fauci neglected mention chronic lung infection lot normal signs extraterrestrial life. 

Generally, people understand difference highly educated guess factual data masses needs know possibilities considered. lethal pathogens easily killed europeans brought americas, diseases could kill europeans completely ravished natives. became extreme versions diseases natives lacked genetic exposure them. Human genetics normal levels exposure novel SARS pathogen elite cannot keep downplaying risks potentially means species, without putting masters human life death. hope best scenarios here. 

But people understand catastrophic potential, virus good countering immunity responses, bodies destroy healthy tissue order remove virus. lethal virus becomes, directly related high titre (or titer ""american"" spelling) exposed since bodies destroy health tissue response exposure. many younger healthy people become sick, directly related high titre become. many people develop chronic lung infection, directly related many people get lung infection. Looking catastrophic spread virus so-called ""united"" states, highly optimistic Fauci say chronic lung infection would unlikely outcome. distraction/denial blame. Soon ""This surge blm protests.""

But we're pretty sure closed environments, people spending decent amount time close proximity. focus that, gyms, bars, churches, public transport, restaurants, big even moderate gatherings.

Random post long ago construction guy asthma wears mask day long making fun people making excuses wearing - someone direct that? already 3 million according Worldometers. Next milestone 4 million. 50,000 cases day, three weeks.... seriously need update right now. Isn’t enough people survive suffer lifetime damaged organs there’s also diminished mental capacity?  Whoever unleashed onto world rot jail burn hell. Everyone pointed fingers nothing?

Currently live Florida, amount insanity governor half population, really want move state isn’t dependent 24/7 tourism. Maybe somewhere like Montana. agree major concern, I’m sure situation makes sense. Covid patients require ICU beds. Broken arms (if inpatient rare) not. beds remain available it’s easy transform regular hospital bed ICU bed. don’t required equipment. bigger challenge people heart attacks, strokes, transplants, etc.  countries USA number active infections millions lots unidentified. thing enforced many areas right blunt things hit everyone whether infected -- lock downs suck that's option number infected people (plus contacts) gets high keep track of. voter profile goes Biden Kanye...

What voter profile goes Trump Kanye...

It's album coming out. mass protests thousands people screaming spewing viruses place, 0 social distancing A-OK, name leftism. Give break. 

We know NY times singling churches, virus. deep hatred anything religious runs leftist circles, including Reddit. agree. are. Also every cunt half brain. Let's throw towels  Even space, would still dealing personnel transportation issues- districts won’t have, can’t afford, enough teachers cover rooms buses necessary move kids around social distancing place. It’s tough spot. teach middle school US tell hygiene personal space two things kids age group really struggle with. bad around.

Jesus Christ, brain taps confronted two whole paragraphs text? may want checked out, can't good. wonder they'll find, anything.... One word: tzara'at Yes let's send kids cross corssing US maybe 50 days person courses (provided teacher dosen't decide remote school let's them) send everyone back home Thanksgiving give family month half long winter break.

K-8 HS could see argument, better contact tracing, local community, etc, holy hell colleges universities, like pandemic speed run. ever think churches viral crisis, I'm always reminded scene Stephen Kings Stand mini series. survivors go church abandoned town filled brim dead bodies people seemed praying asses cure suppose ticket heaven. scenes mini series that's one remember most. heard would gone Easter? Easter 2022? understand doctors. I've experienced similar problems past. Even university/research hospital physicians problematic limited knowledge condition. Years ago, lived near Hershey Medical make expensive trips state Wisconsin get help needed specialists fully understood one rare conditions, specialists kept writing off. yesterday, P.A. clinic insisted knew better I'm allergic/sensitive medication-wise refused enter drugs react clinic's system. follow-up lodge complaint.

With situation surgery, waiting period main insurance plan June switching states live in, type interim coverage would paid initial visits see new neurosurgeon neurootologist.

The medical delays primarily caused symptoms allergic reactions tumor symptoms exacerbated housemate. We've known 20 years so, ever met couple times person never lived close other. said, thought knew fairly well. So, accepted invited move them. idea would stay year stabilize life: I'd build finances working much possible around symptoms since disability yet, would able afford live major city near university/research hospitals resources either enough funding even exist living previously. thought would fine person always kind much closer family.

I learned moved though seem think lot health problems miraculously fixed immune system body toughened push things can't expose things physically hurt me. 

Most delays person making sick antics. pretend I'm fine bad believed suits bring much accomplished yet. yesterday, asked yet seen new neurosurgeon.

I can't say anything badly they're making ill told last month made feel uncomfortable home symptoms I'd find somewhere else live even though knew health conditions symptoms prior moving in. 

So, wasted lot June sick trying find financial help move place own. cost living extremely high, like top ten country highest, programs designed help people type situation (i.e. person multiple rare chronic health conditions initially gain housing stabilize retain independence) closed applications, longer funding and/or overwhelmed job losses housing problems caused pandemic. 

So, today's goal try move forward. 

As insurance: recommend checking Facebook support groups specific health condition talking people see went steps took worked force insurance cover surgery. know even coverage tumor things insurers consider cosmetic related post-surgery repairs see new insurance cover. supposedly cover major hospital rehabilitation costs. zero enforcement. left ""essential workers"" shouldering burden whole time.

As usual, ""leaders"" failed us nothing cuz lobbyists tell tried nothing ideas. CDC's page death reports notes lag 1-8 weeks. (I first noticed someone sent look great Connecticut late March so, realized reported deaths cause since February. send death reports (because busy) = nobody's dead!) think important Americans mess? millions people service industry poor kids getting decimated this. selfish teachers, right? getting paid, kindly think others once. Take away kids. agree. US clearly gearing war and/or sanctions, exemptions many [Trump surely come free.

Anyone else bemused small list exempt? steel, South Korea us. That's it. one ask price was? Probably closer winter US Recordkeeping liability.

And yes, reasonable people expect close cluster. 

End bloody season. 

We live without sports longer, take little bit owner money, give stadium workers low paid employees another 6 months. 

Basketball there, lets make sure players thier families too. Tabloid nonsense celebrity worship far exclusively American ritual. Oh, ok. Florida, people going like crazy since Memorial Day (May 25th), cases going yet death reported. Thanks explanation. Disgusting, truly sickening. protests though. Sad. curious, charts deleted? Yeah ok, keep believing bs make feel better. Agreed. see argument spots public universities taken away in-state students given foreigners.

However, it’s demand seats that’s leading increases tuition. It’s debt freely available American families send children college. Colleges, especially private colleges, set really high sticker price. people wind paying rich Americans wouldn’t otherwise qualify school rich foreigners. students (unless they’re in-state already paying lower rates) tuition discounted, usually form scholarship given everyone pulse decent SAT. They’re subsidized full-pay students.

Does lot money go administrative bloat? Sure. lot also goes subsidizing students don’t pay full. one thought comes mind. happens regular flu season hits? looking school staff members and/or children catching flu, risk Covid top immediately following that? effect be, recovering flu catch coronavirus? Turns model couldn’t predict Americans special kinda stupid. Yet latino kids least affected Latin America... Hmm, yes, im betting race nothing this. could seen coming...Who woulda thunk it..? 29CFR1904 record keeping - liability.

The general duty clause normally accepted mean following applicable laws rules, providing workplace safe reasonably possible. businesses open government provided guidance - reasonable person would expect businesses close simply abundance caution.  millions school see thousands deaths. Period. Kids teachers. October, parents going paid ultimate price this. October, teachers dead complications related COVID19. 

People bending backwards trying admit themselves. need studies. keep seeing argument, see deemed likely correlation causation, studies sure.

Also know Vitamin important innate immune system (hope that's right word fighting antibodies made). Also linked moderating inflammation, believe IL-6 moderation important one factors causing cytokine storm.

We know Vitamin levels important, important enough less sunny climates evolved lighter skin produce Vitamin D. nowadays stay sun way previous generations. hope keep border shut every state every province solid month. Thankfully north border we're already there, never know, could spike again.

Sure pisses Trump, that's small price I'm willing pay :p Winning way stars oblivion. highly profitable use expensive keep empty available admin never want hospital divert icu surgery patient another hospital bed. That's money going competitor. know families paid (pick one) [big pharma, hospitals make money COVID deaths, Soros].  Yup. Supply vs demand. Supply same, demand shooting roof = higher offers. Well, maybe gays inherit Brazil then. Good them.

Get fucked, asshole. it'll useful winter months heating required. Got it. Better nothing guess. Stop. Churches part nation-wide problem irresponsibility, selfishness, ignorance. *Lots* people organizations*everywhere*, religious non-religious, ignoring recommendations would slow spread virus. Churches primary transgressors. say target retribution join ignorance become part problem. Let’s better this, people. Eager open eager get sba loan.

It's disgusting able acquire sba. even pay taxes! fuck able acquire ours.

I never fan religion feel like religious people cons. US one death per 2500 people. Sweden one death per 1800 people. Good thing it’s feds all. try likes states issue. would also likely try executive order withhold funding something would likely get shut soon ink dries. guess decided get closet. Department Children &amp; Families. Social service that's tasked helping children severely dysfunctional home environments. parents Kim Kanye? America Great Britain country 200 years, dude end pandemic? one? “education expert” hahaha. Dirty someone zero education experience become secretary education. slap face put time education. I’m hoping big enough event causes us, U.S, seriously reconsider function. anti-science hyper individualistic society clearly isn’t working us. things like happen can’t people social distancing wearing masks “it’s rights” “it’s oppression” bitch please want see true oppression violation rights looks like take look Hong Kong China. government telling wear mask protect society general, massive ruse infringe upon human rights. people government dont care enough average citizen go much trouble lmao wasn’t soon, right way.

So spotlight them, come find state government nearly experience governing especially crisis like this, turn know Governors really know either, especially crisis management, know sit back, take orders, ???, profit. say ""It's fine"" cities burn. mayors, probably closes people least instinctual self-less morality left systems least impose protection people left keep respective counties order since can't rely higher form government. game stupid, sad 100% literally care lives dies. strategy get serfs back work lords continue turn profit.

Schools opening willy nilly essentially public daycare majority homes. Nobody top actually gives shit whether children well educated. Viruses don’t care plans, still don’t get people don’t understand that. think large portion people still claim religious, don’t feel need attend service.

dying bubonic plague It’s worse US back March closed schools. want fully reopening? country shouldn’t even opening, almost 60,000 new cases day deaths starting climb. government incompetent. Naw man Bible gives solid advice avoiding plague, including face coverings. people missed paying attention modern dogma. Comparing disease hurricane pretty stupid. Alabama, think least partly issue access healthcare. Poorer counties counties larger black populations hit harder closure rural hospitals fact state expanded Medicare. People live counties less healthy (admittedly that's massive generalization) terms chronic illnesses like diabetes hypertension control. And.....we forbidden travel to...(checks map): Mexico, Canada, EU.  brilliant state affairs bouffant-haired leader let happen. insane want willfully enter China now. essentially North Korea west now. I've read median age dropping largely due increased testing young people likely develop serious complications April May.

I pointing mostly old risk. trying make deeper point implications guess now. 

As said mostly old risk here. would also say young asked sacrifice social distancing. Social distancing 55 impact 25. dataalso shows young people less likely distance old broad strokes could say young people kind fucking older generations taking Covid seriously. let's let's pretend like older generations fucking younger generations myriad ways. 

Compared 40-50 years ago 250 hours minimum wage vs 1000 cover typical college fees.

Houses today cost triple 1970 compared average wage. area least housing prices insane largely property owner, read old people, block new develooments keep property values high.

Millenials lucky get 75 cents dollar pay SS medicare.

Did know changed health insurance laws 55-64 age group pay 3 times 19-25 group. Young peoples premiums went 45% old group go 17%? making mandatory insurance. Basically every young person give away least $500 year benefit group average income 20k higher them? 

Shifting tax burden away passive investment income labor. 

The biggest one course lack action climate change.

Most young people know, included, distance vulnerable person lives want get sick. also know people good it. selfish yeah. time I'm really sure anyone would expect young people group put lives hold good old people really seem give damn them. would thought unrealistic part movie would idea government could actually mount competent response? Ahh keep speaking that....

Or fact immunity covid may last months. happen people catch second time do?

Hmmm ct 0 deaths 30 days See next week.  says 67% asymptomatics lung scarring. paper group China 57% asymptomatics lung scarring. think woman video conflating anecdotal evidence sees patients data paper. problem paper healthy control group received lung scans. China highest air pollution world, also damages lungs. need control group type study. Interestingly, control group blood cytokines markers. surprised paper made Nature. Bottom line don’t believe doctor see actual paper healthy control group. isn’t publishing data? it’s part study scans asymptomatic patients? think misciting Nature paper 67% rather 57%. Stockholm 98 deaths per 100.000, New York number 166. large population dilute numbers making country-to-country comparisons almost useless. economy great!

""know people""? sit provide anecdotal evidence day long ""prove"" sorts things. Anecdotally know people still getting regular chemo treatments inconveniences. Hell, I've even visit ER lockdown, inconveniences.

You meanwhile say based ""some people"" claim cancer deaths double months time surpass Covid19 deaths. 

I'll also direct attention earlier assertion .2% rate perfectly acceptable sake economy. suddenly .2% (roughly cancer rate) unacceptable demands action. far tell district plan makes sense. facets logistical problems. example, want socially distance school busses. Well number busses, drivers hours day?

How teachers going find time sanitize classroom? supplies cleaners, provides PPE teachers? I've traveled world. Iran? women forced wear hijab? Lol - want go there, there's something wrong you. “control group” isn’t working out? He's crazy dick bag since first election. He's got base last time.

Don't believe polls, vote like he's winning. I'm okay $40k long that's per person. National average *unemployment* 371.88/wk end 2019 (the last time things ""normal"" best hope using tax basis have). That's $17,850, family *unemployment* 4k hitting cap.


tl;dr - cap $40k total filing people would help ones already unemployment. $40k person (or adjusted filing jointly cap) might actually help lower-wage unemployed people send recipe. hard. low death rate probably 2 factors : 
1) spot treat earlier. 
2) step 1 stress ICU beds dropped meaning serious cases access lfe saving equipment/beds staff. 


Now infection rate rising among younger age ranges, free ICU beds starting  
run across many states. 


Also infected = chance mutates (hopefully less aggressive strain!) 
But might become deadly younger age ranges well becoming ""airborne"" (which reserch conspirator chief also helping people misaligned realities. think fire still fought water therefore going help us long term fight conspiracy anything logic fact people tested? like what, 50k AUD ticket now. never opened NY I’m pissed too. issue deal choosing variety ways.

I think adjust fine hit shores 😀 Initial outbreak COVID-19 town caused single super spreader movie theater. US schools, sadly, open back cases going EXPLODE.

Sweden never closed elementary middle schools, never explosion cases among schoolkids large amount infections could traced back schoolkids.

So would US see explosion cases re-open schools? Australia doesn’t national IDs, state based. Could link COVINE passport guess America would trouble one too... Death count, cases States Born Iran... last year. I'll go back step foot US again... live 2 hour drive US border. ignorant asshole. I'm sure - could factoring mortality rate vs age. Yeah question side effects, severe less severe whatever long term health implications covid I'm going around talking chronic EBV. comes huge list problems including CFS, chronic inflammation, tachycardia, major brain fog etc. Every day normal feeling like flu. bad days bad. I've said issues many years largely dismissed age. I'm 32 may live like rest life. Probably shortened life span issues something I'm slowly accepting. wont give though. 

I always say - never actively mono diagnosed it. Maybe something child missed, I'm sure. always baffled me. shows viruses want find right environment body. 

Much love. Excess deaths reported CDC let's say 25% nation gets sick. 2% dies, 20% gets long term damage 20%, 50% severe.

Imagine next 50 years national taxable income, spending healthcare, new familial caretakers, ability draw army time war vs nation high populations less illness. strong science, we? Meh. They're going hell supporting man publicly embodies seven deadly sins.

Seriously - think sin, surely think documented example Trump demonstrating sin public. Countrywide? Seems like getting obvious increase cases due testing. Really hoped would point would stick kn95 reputable vendor. huge difference though whatever germless offers vs surgical cloth masks point though. got better cure free need billions..its simple hot water throat hot steam inhale. I'm Covid survivor. know one makes bigger ones, big face. find link. bit thicker material great coverage. could also use bandana scarf like thing protects heat. interesting note reports kids dying covid-19, developing toxic shock syndrome, even adults suffering harsh side-effects after-effects really, really, rare. They're pretty much anecdotal statistical point view.

It's happening frequency worth mentioning, course news articles cases tell that.

If things occur noticeable frequency, would way articles it, would actually able track statistics separately. don't, isn't. guessing never decently run one. might surprised well. brief, southern Republican states inconsequential. There'll new president months, 4 years they'll get back in. Southwestern Virginia. 6% minimum wage nothing minimum wage $7.25 average cost rent $900 month unless course want live rundown single wide cost $500/month. say “you’re hearing story it’s rare!” hate argument. 2/3rds country fat. 
 
I keep seeing articles young people dying getting close it. say aren’t high risk, see obese pictures. 
 
I’m mocking anyone else obese. however recognized high risk, obese people take extra precautions. normalized people don’t realize dangerous is. like ""dumping car forest could kill deer"". hard properly dispose mask would insane, R0s 10, sometimes approaching 20. TB lay dark surface like floor barn months swept air transmitted again. highly infectious. far know, laws exist. think chances walking around Ebola (silly example know) isolating seeking care, leads restrained law enforcement, EXTREMELY high. Yes point *prevent* 3 &amp; 4 management world order.

By way can't find country handles worse U.S. Whenever Brazil catches up, U.S. always proves power. Worst. Oh know. I'm saying agree yet, honestly I'm realize could lambs slaughter staff.

The sad truth could setting schools sanitary condition months ago. Instead government denied risks, printed money largely already rich, stuck trying slowly change course without admitting mistakes.

Schools could dividers/seperators, additional nursing staff, testing capabilities. Instead they're weeks away little funding support serious mitigation efforts. ""finger-pointing"" - already April investigations government identified weaknesses work environment contributed spread different elderly homes Stockholm region - employing temporary staff education knowledge informed proper procedures, supplying PPE care staff (even FHM clarified health care professionals get protection ), employing temporary staff also meant workers paid less access proper sick leave worked multiple homes once. already multiple reforms ongoing - first one large package announced already May providing permanent employment 10,000 care workers industry providing opportunity education working ""skilled"" workers yet. recent investigations connected reports consequent findings lot cases hard-struck elderly facilities individual evaluation made patients health needs, unacceptable.

Also, rural hospitals poorly equipped deal severity covid cases. different levels treatment available different hospitals, usually smaller rural hospitals ship difficult cases larger urban hospitals resources treat difficult cases. That's typo, meant Covid-20. Covid-19 last year already outdated, Covid-20 recent release. Bugfixes include improved contagiousness reduced upfront letality, new features include additional adverse long-term health effects. seems Florida too. Listen Sweden tactics based Science, populism.

Here’s interesting reply got another thread. guy put decent work try find out:

*”It's story throughout Europe. Euromo monitors data mortality rates 24 European countries - Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany (Berlin), Germany (Hesse), Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, UK (England), UK (Northern Ireland), UK (Scotland), UK (Wales).

I quick tally deaths across countries - cases, cities - graphs week 45 week 23, inclusive, last four years.

Here's found:

•	⁠2016, Week 45 - 2017 Week 23 : Number deaths = approx 1.9 million
•	⁠2017, Week 45 - 2018 Week 23 : Number deaths = approx 1.8 million
•	⁠2018, Week 45 - 2019 Week 23 : Number deaths = approx 1.8 million
•	⁠2019, Week 45 - 2020 Week 23 : Number deaths = approx 1.8 million

Notably, increase mortality rates period last 4 years.

In 2020, big jump weeks 11-20 ties rise &amp; peak pandemic Europe, mortality rate winter low compared previous years, averages level time period shown.

2018/19 bad winter accounts particularly bad flu season. again, time period, overall level deaths level levels three years.

In last four years, majority deaths people aged 65+. means, year, something kills lot elderly people. 2019/2020 different year**.**

As diseases causes regularly kill lot people every single year, overall effect Covid mortality rates across Europe negligible.

A lot countries list lockdown, yet effect overall mortality rates.

I.e., what's happening India Italy prior. one pretending virus gone? Well that's many people never believed existed begin with.

Nobody wanted lockdown, ""just like flu"", well ... economy. needed lockdown many people even bother basics, like wearing masks social distancing. even states ""flattened curve"" people see reason go back ""normal"" ignoring practical precautions.

Now they're demanding schools open up? general public basic jobs, fought tooth nail, wonder school dilemma? Sorry, collectively job supposed do, issue.

Two working parents? Boo hoo. Maybe need rethink lifestyle need two working parents. Hell, I'm single parent two elementary school aged kids, one IEP willing sacrifice keep home keep everyone else safe get thing control. work I'm 80 I'm digging retirement funds? Yeah probably.

Maybe public need grow take responsibility instead whining squat help get control first place. mention places there's lack funding plans open safely.

Do really think teacher much avoid virus they're room full coughing kids day? teachers ages, young adults older adults near retirement. vulnerable ones that's article about. There's way due testing.

I mean rich people large corporations. :) 

Ultimately, reopening possible people follow guidelines like wearing masks practicing social distancing. and.... one following rules. guess choice either lockdown try keep going see alot people infected dying people grow fuck start following guidelines covered chinas propaganda bullshit lies also china travel ban . opinion sir idiot frustrating shit happening even though be. We’re still seeing excess deaths everywhere. research It’s pronounced April May we’re testing more.

Unless absolutely necessary: news late Jan. much younger population, much health problems young. university closed end year California. can't imagine we'll opening Spring 2021 either. way. No. Fucking. Way. 10,000 new cases day.

Classrooms death traps. Man everyone always skips teachers lol. yes, concern largely would become major spreaders, taking homes (and parents workplaces since that’s whole pushback about), sending teachers families well. makes community spread way faster you’re pretty much guaranteed get school safety procedures can’t really place.

Sweden retained civil liberties exchange thousand lives able leave country rest summer.

The nordic countries stuck inside able go bars restaurants none silly rules needing mask public. good wait couple weeks get data.

I've putting together model hospitalizations hospitalizations deaths peak around July 25th.

If peak week earlier, people getting shit together. peaks later seem like people start wearing masks, U.S. deaths end year could hit 200K+.

That’s nice I'm Texas, gone something similar. I'm film guy literature guy, experience aligns yours. trouble focusing anything serious, dramatic, classic, even though most-watched categories pre-COVID. think last serious movie able watch normally Parasite back in...February?

Still seen Portrait Lady Fire, arthouse releases time shine major studios pushed back dates 2021. Can't pay attention long watching anything Turner Classic Movies, even though used *marathon* channel waking going bed. can't even focus wife watches comfort food films/TV (Moana, Coco, anything Mary-Kate Ashley kid).

My enjoyable film experiences past months literally watching absolute garbage 90s 00s. Shaq superhero movie. Master Disguise. Disney's abomination Country Bears movie. like brain broken stuff get movies even *more* broken thus allow laugh absurdity.

Just know alone. would also hit schools way would like nicely imagine. schools set due zoning usually affluent poor. often predominantly privileged schools basically everyone could theoretically stay home. Whereas lower income schools, almost families could manage that. It’s sad situation around. theyneed WHO, trump fucking idiot Considering thing eat giant bags dicks, makes sense couldn’t find food Vietnam. They’re normal people butt plug May allocated money check never written... Idiocracy nearly much fun real life. Keyboard warrior Ah comparison akin blame simple minded people like you, I'll take note next time. dont anywhere near comparable population density keep repeating crap? China 3 TIMES size India. Even compare 28 per cent desert area China vs 10 per cent desert area India... really maths you?? Pay visit India learn first hand population density means. Blessed cheese eaters Correct decision. UK, EU, Japan, Korea nations cooperate form new replacement even current becomes useless, still needed international cooperation health issues.  great info...and exactly looking !! Act like animals get called animals. Also, biologically humans animals it’s even inaccurate. Interesting, I'm Japan know that. I've actually wondering treatment would infected here, positive cases hospitalized anyway. low death rate compared countries maybe something it. Im glad realize hes getting re-elected  Trump made political now. teachers respond. Strike Trump removed office. threat nation world. clown bro. Sorta reminds Onion ngl Must meds again. guy's music used good. Really went rails mom past away. everyone understands lockdown: handful exceptions: could get groceries medicine take walk.

You're right, weld people apartments like hellhole China. that's we're authoritarian monsters. Oh *planet*? That's actually 549,036 I’m really sorry teachers didn’t prepare give skills needed family deal on-line learning. 

If happened, like happened many places world, you’d better off. say that, think second: really, *really* worse current asshole charge Right? 

B least quaint folkloristic. Like ancient rape-troll. Okay maybe wasn’t much better, never mind. Tremendous....He made despise word. used describe something made shudder feel dirty. Since removed vocabulary Kentucky churches shut down. allowed drive services virtual. Even federal courts ruled didn’t violate constitution. People bitched whined violated orders. It’s fucking dumb. That’s makes mad. truly understand rabid need attend church every Sunday. Fun! rate reach herd immunity 500 days. Then, since don’t know long antibody resistance virus lasts, likely rinse repeat. 

I hate virus. Point taken. would argue it’s mostly parents fault, rather economic political system overworks stresses parents point often can’t parent properly. teachers overworked undersupplied well. It’s fucked situation around. lot school districts laid teachers. supply actually there. course realize nudity legal certain parts world. :) referring portion America taken simple life saving action twisted something political divisive. 

The indecent exposure example using “but, civil liberties!” battle cry face coverings aren’t opposed body covering mandates. 

Personally, don’t give fuck people personal lives isn’t causing harm others. wearing mask public isn’t “personal choice”. 

If everyone responsible cared wearing mask saves lives, wouldn’t need law. wouldn’t need shame. Undeniably, new world living now. it’s life death, don’t care look like asshole tell someone wear mask. Even that’s do. Trump twitter storm loser Trudeau 3..2..1.. someone say that!? seem reading comprehension issues. Might want look that. mean ouch. 

Can loan White privilege dodge shade?! I've made offensive jokes alot never heard outcry. nobody... important. remotely relevant point. still openings “bad cops”? Georgia. Washington US doesn’t 3 million ACTIVE cases. 3 million CUMULATIVE cases. There’s 1.6-1.7 million active cases. Yay, love anti-semitism! beg differ. state Kansas mandated mask use, county affirmed mandate (local officials legal right override state mandates)....but still situation. Neither local grocery store local WalMart offer curbside pickup delivery options. far know, would drive 90 miles (up Kansas City) get option. agree. fact, system already failed, nobody realized something bad happened. Damn right going be? Yeah, seen true nature *other* people specific businesses well. businesses know already garbage, makes worse. keep list stores shop treat employees things like that, I've added HD &amp; S&amp;S list sadly. least Big Aldi's nearby follow guidelines strictly customers get angry point arrows floor. mention last bit guy gave shit told he's going wrong way creating clusterfuck aisle. stood there, 5 minutes, trying figure fucking **ketchup** wanted.

I'm sure things terms teen pregnancy we're even close nations Africa There’s something different governor versus governors.  probably wrong. probably half former Trump admin, right-wing think-tank, pharmaceutical company lobbyist says. Kids transmit though /s administration forcing staff faculty back onto campus threats firings. We're mostly looking work, us can't obtain medical exemptions. truly nightmare realize employer care live die. Headlines like way common. wants see us dead apparently. death race Nov 3rd. Hope last long. little bit easier contain 6 metros 1 million people. compare California (similar populations), actually worse. Canada less cases deaths according Google. hell lot worse cases less deaths (looking California). Maybe goes show healthcare system cracked be. New York completely botched initial handling pandemic made United States look much worse actually are.

&amp;#x200B;

I also would like know guidelines determining Covid deaths compared United States, flawed. 375 deaths reported last checked. Jesus parents dark brown

If looked like people today region, would somewhere white-looking light brown.

But thing papers absolutely right, funny. least Cthulhu visible threat understand schools making good faith effort plan hybrid opening. gotta sort planning and, week, seemed semi reasonable. becoming clearer hybrid opening likely abandoned first week. schools already saying they'll full distance learning.

I understand districts saying they're going full normal opening. 

It's sucky situation students, teachers, parents, administrators. Everything changed yet fully understand how. agree. large, vocal portion insensitive selfish people country adopted attitude Attestupa elderly. 

It’s sad. Yep, recall, death rates fairly stable and/or declining slowly spike. makes sense ICUs filling up, deaths follow, I'd love wrong. priests clergy start dressing like Plague Doctors now? lot boomer teachers teaching longer previous generation peers. expect quickly change move forward reopening. Maybeeeee World Health Organization, U.S. began break ties with, acknowledged possibility airborne transmission week. Yeah, I've always recognized universities corporate structure. different jackasses fight seatbelt laws. Question: take care covid patients. still proper PPE. want sending kids back public school? want kids' school? You’d think might better whole patience thing. Jesus promised he’d come back ages ago...and....and....and....still nothing... idea wtf you’re talking lol ""another thing coming"" ""another think bailout bought months. workers grounds sue. werent locked though. semi-state lockdown. 

This wasnt new zealand wuhan. 

Vast numbers people went like normal locked US cities. 

I one them. Hundreds people walking around everyday middle lockdown. 

*You* *lying* 

you believe fantasy. Sorry dumb question, according UK highest mortality rate world. know is? UK better reporting covid cause death countries? smoking common there? know. people places got hit hard negligent compared people cities got hit? doubt it.

There things do, random math. Florida could either stayed closed opened. main choice. But, open...they're going get infections. Like Florida gets tourists densely populated. open, odds higher people bring virus get many people, can't socially distance much. sprinkle top people stupid things like refusing masks, etc.

But, take city like Pittsburgh. Cases slowly rising. opened later. They're shutting indoor dining. really tourist attraction. **IF put volume tourists come Florida year, state...your infections rise.** include surge capacity? hearing everyone low beds month I'm curious play out. seriously, like gazillion higher chance getting coronavirus mass transit church all. I'm aware data.

I've seen nothing suggest every single person planet catching Covid-19 would worse extended lockdowns. looks like right now. single digits, getting damn well close solid contact tracing system. Trump's estimates **nothing** would 2.2 million deaths. Current US pop 326 million would leave 324 million people approx left run country live. pretty sobering look numbers. live old church held party 100+ people poor girl got died people dumb sometimes therapeutic treatment. That's likely  Like magic. Don’t forget protestors! long time. neoliberal, trickle down, bullshit needs stop. many investment bankers need appointed secretary treasury people realize awful thing? first time clicked got malware pop up; figured random advertisement got filters. second time issues

I got curious refreshed third time hit No-one rest developed world understand society fail people totally - spend twice much it.

Keep safe. Unfortunately means white saviors don’t get turn. Sounds like WFH works better without middle managers throwing extra work employees feel like they're working too. quote presented meme-form immediately call bullshit demographics.

unpack pls, specific  want wait week delivery, sure. can't buy fresh foods, meats, etc etc Amazon - get local retailers. Churches world stupid things. US thing. europeans affordable healthcare great social services Considering rough estimate, numbers ballpark. Or.. Get this... reticulated air system. Crazy idea, right? Im shocked people would split wants. NYC test (Brooklyn) took 2 days come back. think say 2 - 5 normal city. Trump dumps responsibility states. States dump responsibility counties. Counties dump responsibility individual citizens. Citizens Floridians. Nobody takes responsibility anything. Yeah shit Cool, didn’t say weren’t, we’re playing stupid game. 
 
I deal many people work try refuse wear mask still want serve them. Nope, without mask direct threat everyone around them, order products online phone, that’s reasonable alternative suit disability. It’s amazing many suddenly perfectly capable wearing mask choices. It’s inconvenience annoying them. get feeling that’s lot people live whole lives. Lazy, inconsiderate, belligerent assholes sense responsibility actions well-being people around them. 
 
So wear mask without harassed so? Glad you’re one them. please stop trying carve excuse utterly selfish dangerous behavior. *cries european* 134,347 explain please? surprised mayor got covid. walking around protestors without mask quite times. That's spike, curve steepening. really fucking stupid. you’re concerned able scream park shouldn’t going anyway, please sane people favor go die!

Nobody’s coming sister. They’re coming people want keep sister forced work hairstylist, again, *during fucking pandemic*. It’s true. mask mandate one enforcing guy needs shamed curb seems like requiring masks anyone working causing someone else work would fix problem Let run you, see make it:

In Ireland, began lockdown March 12th - schools childcare shut, work home began. 

On 24 March, government announced all non-essential shops close. 

All theatres, clubs, gyms, leisure centres, hairdressers, betting shops, marts, markets, casinos, bingo halls, libraries similar outlets close. 

All sporting events cancelled, including behind closed doors. playgrounds holiday/caravan parks closed.

On 27 March, Taoiseach told everyone Ireland stay home. Though, practically everyone home stage anyway. point, ""full lockdown"". 

For next 5 weeks, infections deaths rose. Then, mid-April peaked began steady decline. 

On 18th May, began lifting restrictions. theatres, clubs, gyms, leisure centres, hairdressers, betting shops, marts, markets, casinos, bingo halls, libraries open. back - terms social interaction - March 12th (schools closed, people working home). 

None lifted restrictions effect number infections deaths. curves still declining. 

So March 27-May 18th, kept social distancing measures place middle period hit peak. So, peak reached lockdown. 

So, Farr's law holds constant level social interaction maintained duration pandemic. 

Once peak infection reached, roughly followed symmetrical pattern downward slope (which plays graphs), per Farrs law. 

If case 60-70% infection required herd immunity case 80% natural immunity, stand this? replace ""teeheehee"" ""bwahaha"". agree you, completely. think that’s schools around started putting dark tint windows, thought maybe security thing think it’s heat abatement sure theory. hotter Ohio Florida right now, broke 1000 cases/day months can't figure I'm claiming I'm claiming. Somehow, seem believe I'm masks, claim Fauci lying woven cloth masks, including masks without nose piece fittings, protective.

Why would go around lecturing people subject can't even figure points are? supposed wash hands every meal using toilet, starters. 

how stop teaching kids this... want know 100% correct. context dependent. number look like hospital at-capacity deaths left streets? Logic, reason, respect life must win day. 

Sending kids school pandemic may reaching new heights, new level arrogance lack respect conditions front us. 

To end? lessen stress parents? stress lessened child brings home virus could send others household hospital? 

We wants schools reopen, guidelines, enough testing, ill-manned schools, already without funding needed reopen safely... beyond pale.  comes consuming excess calories, compared calories body burns exercise normal daily activity.

You right 100% true.

However, commenting ""Obesity"" article pointing disproportionately high death among Black Alabamians, effectively saying ""obesity"" cause gap number deaths. response meant say, ""no, systemic racism"" cause said gap.

So need explain ""racism"" makes people overeat.

But explain systemic racism causes black (and brown) people contract Covid-19, well causes die.

**Increased Likelihood Infection**

Fewer Black Americans Hispanics able work home. [Link Americans work frontline jobs: [at shy 12% work force, work 17% jobs expose strangers Americans likely live cities, difficult socially distance.

We dozens places need testing, hoarding this?! I’m available time (and modern restrooms), extremely crazy. Really?? Fauci every public health official saying need (and do) consistently months. That's anyone need heed know go mingling indoor spaces strangers breathing. really simple. much ""leadership"" people really need??? Republicans demonstrated fine kids dying schools due gun violence. see anyone surprised this. Let guess half which. Pretty simple, cop held accountable them. situation cop called frantic, annoying dick likely one charged held accountable. People going complain cancel culture damn company dodged bullet ask me.

That guy liability Funny thought get jobs back didn’t lose homes/go financial ruin. that’s me. showing reckless disregard feel full brunt pandemic somehow cautious could protected Nurses doctors less hard-hit areas, one would hope (like NYC.)

Although many states end crisis time, like what's happening, well... That's exponentially worse problem. seriously trying compare covid19 HIV? Oh God, subreddit like exist. NYC emergency services instructed bring cardiac arrest patients resuscitated scene declare dead site.


Is real? vaccines many willing vulnerable test subjects will. get data quickly we've ever gotten worldwide pandemic nearly everyone potentially affected. Nobody saw coming... 

Oh wait... Everybody Oooo.i like retrospective study looked severity disease vs. VitD levels patients. Supplements mentioned. cars started driving circles throwing cash giant bowl.

I know got image like pay toll roads, drive by, reach toss money basket continue. sources claims besides living Texas? Ah yes, churches fed poor, tended sick, stockpiled remnants knowledge fall Roman Empire. church numerous factions supporting Galileo dedicated pursuit knowledge. even read history surrounding events spout talking points? Nearly burst laughing that. think needs national strike teachers educators general. National show solidarity amongst educators hardest hit areas. Trump can’t pull Reagan fire right election. Know Nothings! least know shutdown work people follow rules. Hopefully another shutdown needed sure numbers go without change behavior. /s  here, dropped teachers need die peace home! 
/s, teacher. people really can't function without going theme parks. go gym. hobby passion people defy anything even world burning. Pretty crazy end day rather put hobby lives. Citing stuff like ""it's therapy"" We're hit 1% officially infected. 1% looks like ugly. US website, son. really think lock downs happen again. Even bad states nowhere close bad New York was. Maybe could ban bars indoor dinning think we'd likely see mandated facemasks interventions like that. like Groundhog Day:

Is coronavirus airborne?

Could hydroxychloroquine new cure coronavirus? Good him, dumb POS. Never air conditioning career school , heat though ...

I think finally putting tint windows blocks heat would need latitudinal longitudinal study spanning entire lifespan cohort taking vitamins vs. one Well that’s good hear, wouldn’t better meet online? Where’s god now! Muhahaha Mods nuke thread minute anyway. Well, chicken pox often like this. Kids usually get sick. caught kids looked like swamp creature. plastered blisters even look mirror while....too depressing. Still scars 30+ years later. NBA/MLB/MLS/ETC proves test arrive campus I'm working home, actually performing better. dont step all. happy pandemic love work situation. Deaths returned mean.  go church get rona die, okay. god's plan. god needed family needs right now. think sensible people agree limit non-essential activities. protesting life justice essential activity? think one make argument. thing is, evidence protest lead lot spread, would one thing, states spiking right ones biggest protests, Minnesota, Washington etc fine. known time outdoors much safer (19 times safer indoors according Japanese study), protesters seems largely comply masking. Current studies suggest spread due protests, cancelled large number people stayed home protest areas, presumably avoid them, net neutral. See Given current level evidence support protests, even causes personally disagree (i.e. anti-lockdown protests) long distance mask responsibly. wish everyone would stop yelling carry noise-makers instead, though, fair bit evidence yelling unnecessarily risky. Maybe took EMTs longer get died, it’s like driving body hospital fact helps anyone (other perhaps psychologically). Funny it’s shifted deaths cases, deaths still trending down. wait two weeks, right? Nationwide, deaths returned mean. waffle house index 2.0 It’s they’re protest. cause they’re protesting right actively make pandemic worse. Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Overwhelm we'll left Italy-like tough choices gets live gets die. Arizona already scorecard system setup ready go. Guess party belongs to.... first: 133,972 / 24,000,000 = .56% 

second: 133,972 / 31,000,000 = .43%

that definitely impact people perceive risk everyone 21 difference 0.13% entire year's worth death risk, 22-42 year olds risk dying next six months. HIV positive prostitute jailed? bad (and that's grotesque understatement) government seems concealing real stats. think we'd like know demographics. Finally... breathe thing on. covid spread church protests/riots 10s thousands people? 

Got it. 

God damn, guys dishonest believe it. minds able imagine worst . always stocked rice things case worst...  safe I’m wearing N95 mask 6+ feet away people wearing them? outdoors? Keep mind, teacher gets ill quarantine 14 days, teachers class split teachers, increasing class size tremendously. Subs hard find.

Oh, teachers burn sick time (most districts give 1 day per month) take unpaid time. Florida already unable proces Corona tests labs. lol oh profile details updated forever? I'm working cloud thanks pal Good! let’s start standing ground Texas area likely implement full distance learning sit entire semester waiting indefinitely. lot people already pissed delay. 

They also can’t send anyways easily since teachers’ unions actually teeth. held statewide strike couple years ago governor want repeat. flailing hoping sorts quietly making moves get extra time improve distance learning get teachers comply (doubtful).

Can’t speak states. Yeah set take effect July 21, whoever charge next year quietly roll back Remember said 15 cases, going zero, 60,000 deaths? everything revised politicians got complacent short shut completely blown response. 60,000 cases day now.

COVID-19: Hold beer, wait till see else store! Yeah, report recovered people, know doing, know cured them, nobody talking how's life covid things. severity symptoms, even people discharged recovered dead. Reading posts /r/covid19positive find hard believe everyone completely fine months hospitals... China.  right wing think tanks telling us kids can’t spread disease. must fake news!!!! That's like saying Canada wipe ass better homeless person arms legs. 

I mean America lowest bar set, infact someone seems dug six foot hole able set bar even lower, hit Marianas trench quick sand keep going lower till end China. California staying steadier? know cases spiking LA hospitals still way capacity lot reopening pulled back. isn't, there's signicant overlap.

They additional deaths many people died Covid would dead anyway. Whatever heaven requires, churchgoers find quicker wearing masks. Lol k virus deadly people. Jail prison time ruin person's life future.

I can't believe I'm reading. I'm trying juxtapose phrase ""isn't deadly many"" idea death somehow going ruin person's life.

What hell wrong you? drop also? Florida man busy hell lately lol Ignorant proven guilty?.:D That's irony. 

Like, tell give flying fuck fixing racism, don't. goddamn love reiterating talking point. Fuck. We’re turning Quiet Place. perspective? Yeah, used money bailouts they’re still laying people off... I’d like refund. Great news. think Florida ready re-reopen economy. Uhhh.. sounds pretty draconian dude. states ""lock down"" amounted take-out restaurants, bars gyms movie theaters closed. That's it.. Nope. People literally travelling Arkansas Tennessee using Alaska excuse leave shit show. 

It western provinces far. Sounds like west side Saskatchewan. heard anyone group complain happening Manitoba yet, doubt all. Many “studies” garbage, New York’s contact tracers instructed ask anyone they’ve protest. Okay. think missed point comment. I’ll try something you’ve probably heard before, “birds feather flock together”...we’re essentially asking police punish world views clarification, ""medical report"" meaning, including report medical literature, possibly describe, although commonly referred H&amp;Ps (for intitial workup documentation), clinic progress notes (follow documentation). true hadn’t played ball first couple months lied public masks, I’d agree. however deny service ask leave factually increase spread virus. sake around you, put mask.

Also, security contact local police someone becomes “patriotic”. Ah yes. one single hospital Italy Covid footage came from. aren’t. planning socially distance. Future generations thank us. Okay, pretty much agree everything said mostly playing devil's advocate, seems unrealistic deem church unimportant service. much wish everybody sort agnostic-atheist, putting forth jurisdiction keep people going church seems like something could bad implications, no? singling churches? local restaurant reopened quarantine (when illegal so), many places same. viewing churches big problem?

EDIT: Spelling error Water wet says Canadian PM. is, pronounced conservative/right leaning circles, see academics “elites” are, best, touch working class, worst, involved massive conspiracy carried Hollywood academic scientific communities along “liberal media.” 

There still lot Americans value education would like see country become world leader science again. Lots people love say society. (Anecdotal) friend like that: ""I believe vaccines, got kid, kid get them..."" now, ""oh there's proof COVID bad real say, want us shut up."" A: nurse! 😬! B: ""they?"" country's leader cabinet ""they?"" choose stonks. means freedom hereby discarded indefinitely? K12.com I'll use needed. BLM this? Ah yes 200C hot metal plate inside airplane. Can't see could go wrong Agreed, that’s problem. agree US medical system broken. disagree transmission type ""been obvious"" ""doesn't matter"" says when. Neither 9/11 corona particularly big events.

You're dumbass teenager. even remember life 9/11. Life changed *drastically* everyone 9/11 especially American. Think things came 9/11 without straining brain much. interesting see play Ukraine, stuck first couple months pandemic.

At first, government very, reluctant shut churches. started limits number people inside, mask requirements, ""socially distanced bread blessing"" sort thing. working Easter, ordered churches shut down.

The Ukrainian Orthodox Church followed direction immediately, held 100% Easter services online. Russian Orthodox Church (who take directions Moscow) defied orders went ahead services.

Guess happened next?

There large outbreaks several Russian Orthodox monasteries, including head significant one Kyiv. said would continue hold services, even this.

The government responded shutting monasteries completely posting national police front gates. I've got hand hard right thing. 

It picking anyone's beliefs. saving lives everyone come contact with. God still (or won't) virus gone. Thoughts prayers? Tone down? evil POS world hacked highest office flat traitor set country back DECADES!!!. Stoic first trust me, you’re angry right you’re either side and/or paying attention. Go scratch guy talking China's handling virus origin it, spread around globe could suppress information hinder countries responses things like saying travel bans unnecessary racist? Sorry travel Trump border photo op put ice cream scooping hand wall. world facing pandemic novel coronavirus humans natural defense for.

It's symptoms last months, cause strokes, blood clots, heart damage, brain damage, etc. 

I mean serious would never open put people risk? Right?? Sorry florida man, administration monopoly fake virus cures like bleach, disinfectants, hydroxychloroquine  Going beaches. Cali. goes first week Aug Labor Day depending district. That's brilliant! would mean anti-covid. So, following logic, let ICU reach 200% capacity solved crisis. must brief president governor immediately. sounds like kind plan. Good job thinking outside box, man. really done it. I'm glad go back normal now. Pheww North Carolina hovering 0.99 1.04 well 2 months now, consistently first red_state chart 

I wish people would make concerted effort initiate downturn half state seems give shit

Also, say red_state bot thought political literally referring red color chart. Bad bot. somehow think Covid sketicism US phenomenon.

There large anti-lockdown/anti-vaccine protests happening around world.

It's American media tended report reason. guess three reasons: misclassifying deaths (Florida example), it’s spreading younger population (there article posted average age 15 years younger getting virus now), standard treatment three months ago. 

I think we’re focusing wrong number, focusing hospitalization rates hospitals become overrun that’s death rate spike lack adequate care treatment. know, hard restaurants navigate this. feel bad industry. I'm also situation laid pandemic, really hoarded UI money, know what's coming fall, winter, next year. got carryout couple times ""cheap"" places, two meals costs much whole bag groceries could last week. 

I know people want support them, know. hard right now. One co workers blew UI money takeout drinking, called back work, slow got hours cut deeply, financial trouble. would think they'd need teachers since class sizes much smaller. intense way saying 720 day. Capitalism  protest cause Thank god getting rid people worked Little Rock. Yeah, ok! Hey bout meet wish death upon person. I’ll wear mask, scream. ())::::::::::::::::D~~~~~~~fuckyou! People go church tend fear death much most, also tend old. old people putting risk that, young people putting old people risk, that's what's ok. Sounds like parody Porn movie. love says “while would hope schools could reopen”.....thank Captain Fucking Obvious. nuns America flexing rulers speak.  science denier.

I'm American care Trump.

It's ashame see whole sub like reject science favor irrational foundless hysteria.

I imagine people anti vax. could Covid stay mutate decades centuries.

If that's case, become less dangerous time passes. Like happened syphilis came Europe. first devastating. Infected millions. Killed quickly. eventually became disease people could live years with. Trump University Oxford? balance throughout recorded history? Fuck yeah is, unironically.

No amount conditional soup make amount corruption, suffering, death incited by, sanctioned by, and/or validated religion. *Especially* Judeo-Christian based ones.

If looked love, admiration, empathy towards fellow humans strength instead wrathful invisible sky friends, world would almost certainly significantly better place us. **Jack Nicholson nodding smiling maniacally.gif* almost though praying work God. Churches made illegal. It’s literally cult give tax break to. 940 free beds, 9900 new cases Florida today think serious rate hospitalization 15-20%? Let’s say 10%

So basically icu full tomorrow day tomorrow would think? new numbers serious case rate? ""The new coronavirus survive droplets aerosol three hours experimental conditions, although depends temperature humidity, ultraviolet light even presence types particles

Most countries world (with exception Brazil) handled outbreak better USA. Luckily Brazil stop USA worst worst. Death rate still flat we’re good. I’m going go stand corner close eyes stick fingers ears think happy thoughts. Depends open not. there's room 10 people 1 infected, 7 uninfected 2 postinfected, get rid virus vaccinate uninfected. social distancing masks strictly enforced, one infected either die recover virus host present transmit virus. problem real world, people keep mingling. state Arizona sent hundreds immigrants churches town churches ones actually take in. mean, anyone believe US government either? Trump trying conceal numbers dismantle testing. 

We ain’t anymore honest shit either. Surely people lockdowns masks lining fly United now, right? That’s 720 day. would take like 1200 years get everyone “at 2 minutes apart.” want jail wear mask, sick? Crazy. I’m feeling déjà vu.

Oh yeah happened NY already...  I’m gonna venture guess live “right work” state. Or, teacher sick, combine classes. extremely common flu season. lockdowns huge global crisis virus isn't.

Yeah, I'm going potentially expose child life changing virus make idiot politicians look good. I'll home school vaccine least get control. I'm guessing small towns can't get enough employees cover that. That's pretty selfish. people get carried away, Canada closed border China Europe *after* US. 17,000 severe undercount especially Disney World school reopening can't compare 130,000 cases cases also linked something church. 

E. g. link 650 cases churches able link 500 cases bars paints way different picture. We've mask mandates 2-3 weeks AZ, plus gyms/bars/water parks shut last week. Hopefully helps soon. Germany control. don’t. There’s comparison. OK&lt; let's look another way start falling media panic:

 *In May, France counted 143 additional deaths every day average,*

The peak rising

 *In April, France counted 695 additional deaths every day average,*

The peak hit

*Over last seven days, France counted 18 additional deaths every day average,*

The end peak

*Yesterday France counted 32 additional deaths previous day.* 

Is reason calling ""a second wave""?

Could lag counting? 

Or could next seven days, average out? 

At least give week shouting sky fall. True, least enforcing mask mandate imposing fines don’t comply ... got kind enforcement across state ... use fireplace instead broiling think idea randomized controlled trials (RCTs) believed something scientist agree with. value observational studies lot. fact, lot times cant really start RCT without evidence observational study. issue observational studies need make sure measuring think are, (consciously often unconsciously) p-hacking, claims backed evidence. order, say observational correlation, RCT performed concrete evidence. treatment relatively harmless cheap, maybe compassionate use order RCT figures benefits harms detail. However, case Vitamin D, observational studies looked seriously flawed lacked scientific rigor would expect studies. doesn’t work lot kids.  giving option good. got kidding me... tried getting tested today Los Angeles, guess much costs without insurance. place went wanted charge $180 consulate additional $80 lab work. walk clinic anywhere near me. called appointment places wait week. America, wondering behind countries charging hundreds testing average wait time get test still around week. 

This apply entire country maybe see cases spiking LA county. pandemic testing free charge? people need prove poor get fee waived PANDEMIC? real time profiting people? Disney definitely needs open statewide emergency. Hey buddy. apply Substitute Teacher feel like reopening schools fine stuff. hear there'll massive slots available due people wanting teach due type pandemic going something. area place movie “The Little Giants” took place put things perspective. blame you. occupational therapist real dilemma. parents mom n pop shop got nothing PPP loan. Smfh. Applied numerous grants none accepted us. Duh. lives stake. Holy fuck. suffering covid, denies coverage others. 

What fucking monster. sound great. Hopefully scientists figure mutation something article makes sound like one recently affecting gastro-intestinal tract rather respiratory People idea kind legal precedent statements like would create. ffs... sound like refreshingly rational person (no snark). Unfortunately strategy Beijing used involved mass testing via batches, works population prevalence low. 25% tests coming back positive, running batches work re-test almost batches anyways. I'm partial tarring feathering. that? discouraging. People go absolute great lengths wear piece fucking cloth go store. It’s easiest thing do. requires almost nothing outside buying making mask washing hands frequently.  Let fix you....

 **The World handled coronavirus outbreak better United States, Everyone says** Check time? Yep. got extremely sick infant, immune system collapsed, mom worked elementary school. doctor told needed find job wasn’t school schools germ-infested.

Wichita fucking hellscape right 1 100 kids dying Corona?  knew? hate humanity :( sure say cause harm

That too. Imagine, global public health organization concerned causing harm...shock horror! Interesting. suspect reason cases continued climb post-lockdown due largely infections within family units spreading family members well spread among essential service people, grocery shoppers scofflaws. case decline continues despite releasing constraints, suggests major offender social system still muted lockdown. I've also wondered infections start burn particularly bright hot new means spread become likely. sort super-non-linear effect possibly related viral dose. still reject hidden lifecycle variable virus dictates progression regardless factors. seems like magic. may real, make sense me. Covid-19 cancelled quite lives, 🙉🙈🙊 Thank you. I'm working losing weight exercising right now, hoping give little protection classes resume beginning month. ask nice hot cup tim hortons every morning get along swimmingly. people big readers. ""Our independent survey 200 participants also proved point correct.""

A study 200 people proved something? Typos, small study, using word ""proved""... Definitely study done professional. love horror though well stocked. I'd like see real study done subject. neighbor neurosurgeon, also Covid early, thinks got plane full skiers Austrian alps. Italians Austrians.  He’s 54, excellent health, mild symptoms two days. 

He’s busy main gig repairing aneurysms, emergency, stays well away Covid hospital. little say Covid.

I told anti mask sentiment. told internet propaganda went around claiming cloth surgical masks would poison CO2! He’s worn surgical mask 8+ hours day 3 days week last 20 years! 

His reaction: “how could anybody read know false”  actually pretty easy see, look manufacturing supply chains. February severely disrupted, Wuhan issues subsided quickly went back normal remained. annoying. you’re deflecting question: death rates increasing multiple states? states, we’ve established faith (somehow) death rate continue decrease nationwide.

And makes think LA magically buck trend increasing death rate exactly numerous states prior?

You realize you’re making exact argument people made right? they’ve wrong literally every time.

It happened China, won’t happen here.
It happened Italy, won’t happen here.
It happened New York, won’t happen elsewhere.
It happened Texas Arizona won’t happen Louisiana.

What’s next? happened Baton Rouge Shreveport? 

Deaths lag, exactly one week matter what, states continue follow footsteps New York, Texas, Arizona, California, Florida (the list getting long), unless active measures start taken slow thing down. 

But I’m sure people like preaching “it’s big deal” continue trying downplay this. believe many Americans think bad (overcrowded hospitals, etc) throughout Italy. guess gun ranges religious institutions people. Mmmmmaybe seen situation yet kids school/buses faculty/staff 8 hours day cases coming around 50k every day. may schools petri dishes needed bring little ones adult numbers. true said people got ones staying home theme park roller coaster enthusiasts. Yes basically travel multiple parks every year consistently visit parks near residence. Obviously see problem. call addiction, hobby. fact coaster community bit controversy earlier coaster influencers attending smaller park without masks social distancing nonexistent. dabble see going park anytime soon unless know perfectly safe efficient operations COVID-19 protocols make everything slightly worse course. 5,000 cases?

Wait, stats indicate 982 active  Wow capitalism censored anymore probably start finding he's involved sorts awful groups soon acts like asked old lady wear mask store requires membership &amp; mask enter like test free. make appointment. really throw hands air quit already.

It changed. Imagine screwed backwards country comparable peer nation Brazil Ok long lines Oregon times article referencing? (the last month) used test people symptoms needed save priority patients. many tests. Oregon experiencing surge. see connection.  Florida man sons selling fake cure COVID-19..... 

The Trump family??! mentioned genocide Brazil’s indigenous people several times campaign.

Not surprised see purposefully kill indigenous people witholding help. Right, focus translating research real-life situations. think they're overestimating schools capable resources disposal, even receive additional government funding. cleaning supplies, going cleaning? staff lunch breaks, kids need silent breakfasts lunches masks off? staggered bus schedules mean school start end times? happens multiple teachers staff become sick? in-person online teaching managed? many questions, real answers these, least county.  Found snerican It'll never provide 0 protection covering nose mouth... might far optimal 0 guidelines published CDC giving recommendations based data? example:

- Increase lock measures case fatality rate greater x%

BTW NY post article definitely says health crisis, minorities priority it. kind undermines whole theory virus fake (oh sorry, claiming cases ""inflated"", could silly think changing story every time told).

Seriously, use valid sources like adults do. know facts. demonstrate ability able pay tuition expenses. prove self supporting. know aren’t native English speaker please slow try understand English arguing English stating lies.

""You can't protest reopen local government, protest political message even larger crowds every day week"". What?

The message matter, either 1A suspended due pandemic isn't. ""the virus thee virus me"" nonsense.

Similarly ""essential"" business enforced. Entirely selective ridiculous. Local game stores, arts supplies, florists closed want vidjah go big-box retailer instead. want landscaping stuff, go big home improvement store. Local businesses? luck.

Restaurant? Alright, start seat people. Bars? remain closed, restaurant bar people eat, problem!

That's government picking winners bullshit. equal protection application law. **Unconstitutional**.  Everyone handled better us. look Italy....

My point supposed isolate feel need tested. Whether 36 hours 200 hours, changes amount time healthy person would needlessly isolate. change point time someone would need medical attention, series rapid, however highly accurate tests given hospital environment.

Honestly, that's less school shooting. know we're whining about. /s following logic. saying, people whatever public places? People wear whatever, wear, saying? Let double check here. run dog grooming shop bought cases masks 80¢ apiece. employees need pass anyone needs one. won’t even talk client won’t wear mask. 

We shoulder little cost, little work, COVID future. 🤷‍♂️ Ah, woosh. get now! You’re FAKE NEWS! /s Im sure arguing. saying yes correct, federal law, 1000 people used fight employers 2014. whats disagreement? perfect help everyone? true everything. Thanks agreeing correct. provide solution this? People post whatever they’d like. can’t control say, that’s called freedom speech. 

People don’t think critically. That’s problem. “20-30 crowd” strange way spell protestors/rioters. 'We believe much should'

Like fox guarding henhouse. live Upstate NY. 

No idea school reopens time, online class, etc. world extracurriculars, sports, etc.

My daughter going senior year. Supposed crowning achievement high school career. looks like sports teams on, clubs join, dances proms, drive thru graduation. Spending summer taking ""virtual tours"" colleges YouTube. 

It sucks. going get ugly.... 60K stat ""new confirmed cases."" link provided ""the total daily number virus tests conducted state tests, many positive day."" 

They're cherry picking anything. two different numbers counting two different things. choose follow either one, going alarmingly, keep we're doing, trend going continue. drop also?

$400M US per year people said Chinese transparent, still say masks necessary, still cling ""heavy droplet"" model transmission. That's top seriously dropping ball Ebola. throwing good money bad. 

Don't confuse potential international health leader reality today. high level confidence requires low level intelligence. anyone sick? anyone hospitalized? Frankly, healthcare professional, matters. Yeah know shitty ""news"" site preferred one far. first report issue. one thing doctors nurses flood NYC deal unprecedented pandemic initially got control. 

It’s another thing entirely expect second time know keep control can’t bothered. Numbers wont matter still conservatives saying flu kills people every year hospitals lying numbers get government money. half country continuously disregards facts either like believe. functioning society type environment. late opinion locations enough tests keep demand results taking 7 days labs backlogged. read find print holding Disney harmless catching COVID. problem liability waiver? population 1.4 billion. 1,400 millions didn't. without fail.

There's generation though, maybe that's went wrong. Yeah, guess we'll find pretty soon. I'm curious see cases start shifting back North fall, seems likely hot temperatures South keeping people inside AC part reason cases skyrocketing, coincided early reopenings hard parse one other. rebuttal, would MUCH rather pissed breathed stranger right now. 


To clear, it’s solely pandemic. generally pee-seeker, there’s anything wrong that. honest question schools responsibility? 


In Indianapolis city issued PEBT cards students funding food outside school. also weekly meal pickups everyone begged attend loose funding. kids provided breakfast, snack, Lunch, PM snack light dinner.

Our schools scheduled reopen 29th full attendence. I'm assuming get one positive case whole thing come crashing that's plan have/ Mourning Even surgical masks practiced long ago. read b4 one Chinese doctor made prevent spread certain doctors didnt believe etc. rural area I'm in, actually even get first case mid late May. something put together bandana hair ties used couple trips Kansas City, mostly stayed local felt relatively safe without. Even now, county 5 listed cases, one working state 2020 without ever returning area. 4 masks rotate - that's actually enough me, work home rarely leave house.

Everyone available pitches help cover shifts, god help build whole team moms young kids, one cover last minute either. solution really except try make sure team diverse places, overstaff team cope unreliability. really unpopular say, true.

By Brad Schmidt | Oregonian/OregonLive

Coronavirus cases among Oregon children younger 10 grew fivefold month June, representing fastest growth rate new presumed infections across age range.

State public health officials said increase largely due unidentified transmission within community, although outbreaks day cares also playing small role.

The Oregon Health Authority Tuesday reported 319 confirmed presumed coronavirus infections among children younger 10. number May 31 stood 58.

Young children still represent smallest overall share cases Oregon. young children among least likely need hospitalization, eight patients deaths.

But surge concerning state public health officials say that, without correction, could dim prospects children school desks fall.

“I hope increasing cases among children lead people reevaluate behavior take additional precautions,” said Dr. Melissa Sutton, senior health adviser Oregon Health Authority.

Sutton said rate infections Oregon “certainly endangers prospect reopening schools fall” urged residents maintain social distancing, wash hands comply Gov. Kate Brown’s order requiring masks people age 12 older indoor public spaces beginning Wednesday.

“Our actions real consequences,” said, “and might impact reopening schools.”

The somber message comes Wednesday marks 100th day since Brown announced sweeping stay-at-home order sent state’s economy sputtering worked slow spread virus. Brown began easing restrictions May 15 infections subsequently surged, doubling 8,656 close June.

Brown Tuesday extended state emergency September said Oregon crossroads, recent modeling warning exponential growth new cases.

“Oregon, choice,” Brown said statement. “You help save lives again. happens next us.”

The rapid surge new cases among children newborns age 9 gone relatively unnoticed – part lack transparency state agencies. Neither public health officials day care regulators previously reported outbreaks day cares, declined multiple requests Oregonian/OregonLive week quantify cases, saying information would released Wednesday.

The young age group nearly caught infection totals among Oregonians ages 80 over, group likely die COVID-19.

While vulnerable seniors largely remained isolated outside world, many Oregonians – including children – resumed semblance daily life. enabled virus spread readily among younger people, including parents 20s 30s, Sutton said.

Health officials Tuesday able say many children confirmed presumed infections live households parent sibling also tested positive. Sutton said infections children generally traced another source, noting community transmission “driving force.”

Young kids went almost exposure, following unprecedented shutdown schools March, returning activities include day camps, sports trips playground.

“I don’t think there’s ever time recent history children sheltered,” Sutton said early months pandemic.

Part increase may due testing among children, added. testing alone explain jump.

Coronavirus symptoms among children infections generally include cough, fever, nausea, diarrhea sore throat, Sutton said. Oregon reported one case multisystem inflammatory syndrome children, seemingly rare condition appears strike sometime coronavirus infection.

The mere mention condition cringe-inducing parents. causes inflammation key organs, heart brain, doctors don’t know causes it, according Centers Disease Control Prevention.

It remains unclear precisely many Oregon’s new coronavirus cases among young children traced back day cares.

“I think small proportion linked child care outbreaks,” Sutton said. “The vast majority simply due social mixing.”

The Oregon Health Authority Monday Tuesday would provide figures requested Oregonian/OregonLive total number outbreaks day cares statewide associated infections. would Office Child Care, regulates providers.

Jonathan Modie, spokesman Oregon Health Authority, said agency would begin including information weekly reports released Wednesday.

Officials plan disclose day cares least five infections enrollment least 30 kids. aren’t planning differentiate infections children workers.

Modie Tuesday declined say many distinct outbreaks would reported, although apparently handful.

At least one outbreak reported KinderCare Lake Grove.

The day care notified parents June 14 someone tested positive, according records obtained Oregonian/OregonLive.

The center told parents June 25 eight children tested positive 69 enrolled, according records. message, KinderCare said 12 teachers also tested positive.

Some parents expected outbreak eventually amid pandemic, despite appeared best efforts among staff. families encouraged seek testing children spent time around infected teacher.

The incident left edge, awaiting results.

“It’s worrying don’t lot data children, especially can’t speak yet can’t articulate they’re feeling,” said one parent, requested anonymity speak outbreak fear retribution child.

KinderCare Tuesday declined identify number cases Lake Grove facility company outbreaks Oregon locations.

“As soon learned positive diagnoses Lake Grove, partnered Clackamas County Health Department closed center 14 days allow professional deep cleaning, retraining protocols re-testing staff reopen,” spokeswoman Emily Snyder said statement. “We’re also taking extra step retraining Oregon center staff ensure we’re delivering highest standards possible.”

State officials long aware fact day cares could become sources coronavirus spread. March, Hillsboro day care worker tested positive, fact Office Child Care confirmed time.

Melanie Mesaros, spokeswoman agency, said email Tuesday misleading compare decision agency’s stance defer state health authority. That’s officials disclosed information March, prior executive order Brown required coronavirus reporting made health authority, said.

Oregon officials slow disclose outbreaks nursing homes, workplaces day care facilities, often deciding release broader information news reports.

State officials would say Tuesday whether reporting outbreaks day cares sooner, stressing working find right balance public disclosure individual privacy.

Modie, health authority spokesman, said officials could use new disclosure plan day cares apply schools fall, outbreaks occur. many people need together build virus load high enough? Water: wet. 

Sun:hot. checked TDSB, PDSB, YRDSB, nothing.
Where getting information from? please provide it?
Both Ford Lecce announced in-person attendence voluntary upcomming school year.
I dont see anything anywhere says changed? Excuse me? defend point wrong imprison people might ill, call someone bloody cockwomble, thay's worth deleting?

Fuck it, ban hell hole. disease kills 90% infected would successful virus. Unless extremely high infection rate killed slowly compared inefection rate, ot would kill hosts getting pandemic levels. viruses supposed worry new ones spread fast relatively low death rates. successful dangerous ones. likely kill people let's say... Ebola higher rate infection relatively low death rate. sheer number infected would kill people. that's besides point. point making matter deaths spike. avoiding matter what. always balanced lives economic considerations

We obviously well given current situation we're in. become pretty obvious cannot need control spread virus, states reverse course opening plans. fill hospitals ICU beds create serious situation healthcare system people need beds accidents something virus, can't get care need. kills people. take much overwhelm U.S healthcare system. trying risk it. Yeah certainly reasons worry. Right people started get around more, meeting outdoors probably lowers risk quite bit. Let's hope numbers dropped enough fall counter risky behavior surely come worse weather Don’t wear case run someone. wear something around neck pull nose &amp; mouth quickly. 

You don’t need hide house. Figure ways see people exercise. Meet parks, set chairs 6 feet apart someone’s yard. took medical advice politicians. Churches religions entire foundation based going critical thinking/science/logic.

Why would anyone expected change now?

This religion churches shouldn’t desired. 

Freedom religion/respect religion/pandering religious folks mistake beginning.

Indoctrination abuse.

Freedom exercise religion = Freedom indoctrinate. need people like run public office. Still?!? Bumper stickers, fat chicks, make fun disabled, sickly people, racists bumper stickers seems hit minorities more. yes percent testing big time. hospitals filling up. also supposedly lie someone knows someone empty.

I apologize advance joke. really care donation basket passed around. Pastor needs pay insurance two Lexus. mind blowing number is, people keeps touting virus 1% deadly. means US, 3MM people dead due virus. course, cannot wrap heads around well can't math, plain denial.

Fuck it. Let’s again.

That's gonna get trouble license board praises high, Israelites today given double protected father, free 400 year curse #blm can't right, surely jeebus protects flock church fleeces them?   First grossly misrepresenting God. 
God Just. Aka, something, every moral right it.

Secondly, thing Jews Jesus keep Sabbath. 

Thirdly:
Acts 20:7
1 Corinthians 16:2

There go, biblical support meeting Sunday (first day week) Cause reddit left 2020 I'm curious. church 25 years, lying still considered sin? really can't tell anymore. machine elves. There’s getting it. amount breathing. Nothing. I’ve always woe hole, it’s deeper walls closing in. It’s much much lower. I’ve known people tested 8 times testing positive. I’m sure they’ll get tested start recover. Nope- test results week ago. went state testing site Fort Lauderdale Saturday last (06/27) still don’t results. reporting numbers tests processed results significantly time delayed. Basically , results people got sick two weeks ago. smoke pot dont colon go bathroom nivht harsh stomach acids im contact burn ass increased amount bowel movements agitate further. go upwards 15 times day sometimes more, every time eat. itches painfully bad touch hurts even more. Im night pain discomfort havent slept 4 hours *months* . havent eaten 16 hours hurts bad go. Im hungry. smoke pot literally nothing else help manage pain. Ingesting something? dont colon. dont get anything pills anymore. yeah. F bro perfect privileged health. Must fucking nice. vaccine rest us. thank anti-vax people helping us solve who-gets-vaccinated-first problem. ended hospital asthmatic bronchitis, since crappy parents want get prescription. adult, make sure symbicort, honestly coughing Pneumonia usually get sick like used to. wonder history tell churches spent money corona?

Did churches donate less? I'm betting coffers shut tight know steady income again. like equate going store risking life well lives loved ones. put items need context. worth risking life X. case we're low food yes, otherwise usually no. Republicans anti medicine, good know. It’s Wuhan food market ... sure places considered essential!! field hospitals? Comfort dispatched there? clear misconceptions here. Catholic say least Catholic Churches Ive East Tennessee visiting Mexico, separated/seated family absolutely wear mask won’t allowed enter. Officially stiil dont attend feel sick it’s recommended thatbyou stay home would rather watch livestreams Mass another option. Also collection baskets use. Either priest asks youd like donate send envelopes mail donate online Parishes use baskets long poles usher extends basket simply drop donations avoid spreading stuff. Stop spreading misinformation overall generalizing Churches one same. denominations taking steps make sure one gets sick. far places “ pastor” power say so, cant speak them. (Also response comments claiming churches fueled ulterior selfish motives ignoring CDC’s recommendations sonthey continue make mone, response post itslef) Wow, Sweden lockdown secretely killing elderly still less 6000 people died. disease must truly harmless. First, understand can't diagnose 100% cases, wonder gets factor 10-12.

Second, like host. Seems like he's shooting shit guest. say anything “looting” “riots”?

No. said “protests”, going on, people sub claimed reason increase cases. Which, pointed out, studies show protests contribute significantly increase cases.

So assume you’re going claim vast minority people engage actual looting somehow massively spread COVID people going churches bars flaunting “freedom wear mask” somehow weren’t majority contributing factor. positive cases, infected? bet ones mild symptoms among us. Frightening. may well right, don’t know sure based yesterday’s numbers. increase compared recent Tuesday’s basically equivalent decrease recent Saturday’s, Sunday’s Monday’s reported weekend. canceled deaths still (slightly) weekly basis compared last week. crazy watch America doing. know laugh cry react. news I've getting thing really dumpster fire situation? 29 hours week isnt even full time job. worked 8 hours day they're working little 3 days week. another 4 days off. Seems bit absurd complain people cranking 60-84 hours week pandemic due unprecedented workloads. yea, competition, show definition ""too much time working"" differs among people.

(As disclaimer I've working 50-60 hour shifts fact take week every 2 months I'd sick, aware many dont luxury.) Yes, flu normal virus, one isolated. First off, never said virus ""no big deal"" words, mine. also never insinuated okay old people dying. fact, stated multiple posts highest risk population need protection. I'm also Republican, believe freedom speech. 

We quibble infected fatality rates. believe less 0.5%, open possibility wrong; however, IFR's far settled medical community. See twist words make false accusations. are, quite frankly, liar and/or use deliberate tactics try discredit me. Trump logic right there. don’t test cases must spreading! high positivity percentage means testing less. logic backwards Consider Cordero, hospital months dying. 

The reason death rates dropped spread among much larger area. areas heavily impacted New York, started testing time peak started, people start dying rates saw then. Sprinkle top that, many hospitals overrun patients saw Italy. see death numbers start slowly tick upward we've seeing, matter week two start seeing 800+ dead per day single states again, possibly time since none states really locked down. black people disproportionately effected lol? black people obese. saying implying that. asking. experience could something unfit living conditions seeing lower income families live things like mold insects seeing landlords nothing raise rent lower income communities also recieve funding. could continue, know is. agree. Early outbreak places literally testing severely ill people telling everyone else stay home. Selection bias skews fatality percentage higher.

Now, austin started implementing similar ""only test sick people"" strat, let's see shakes weeks. * 7 day trend new daily hospitalizations hit new time high today (up 6%) record number daily hospitalizations recorded. inpatient data even worse looks first glance record number discharges. [See chart spreadsheet [with data record number patients (an increase 45% yesterday!) [were seen really bad news. know Subaru Toyota use Port Portland one US port entry Japan. seeing port St. John’s it’s small doesn’t look like accommodate post-Panamax ships like Long Beach/Oakland/Seattle/Vancouver. take cue sk Lockdowns work Italy reopening fast... let’s hope 3.4% (the R0) population killed first wave... Technically guys number 1 comes number cases Humanity historically well take away intoxicants. ""worship"" done anywhere. So, I'd say churches non-essential. Also, pot shops medicinal many cases. So, vital, non-essential. t’s like don’t even read Bible. It’s money churches, religion

That's unconsciously know reading make contradictions stand shake faith.Also explains atheist seem know bible religious people time. Yeah, sure. original question likelihood vaccine make FDA approved selling masks contain virus inside illegal churches major source, stores like walmart even businesses like health clinics not? take grandmother health clinic every week people wearing masks, practicing social distancing, even keeping touching other. try enforce safety measures, nobody outside waiting go seems care. places like walmart. Everyone touching everything, picking stuff up, putting back, staying distant, etc. know church's getting alot backlash. Woah sounds like real-life *Flowers Algernon* lesser degree agree. It’s awful feeling loved one becomes number, part statistics. I’m sorry loss. care downvotes because...? Additionally National Guard typically state based. would mean ordering Guard force kids school. Yet company wants go back full schedule. 
No. happening It’s one guy rest line behind like stupid fucks

""Complicit"" word looking for. Yeah, shit.... think accelerating... Poor guidance lack scientific backing... Yep, article say that. said ""COVID like normal virus."", nothing flu. Quit amplifying fear doubt. Tremendous control can't pass collection plate zoom  There’s solid science behind this. know mortality virus largely due body’s immune response, virus itself. Mast cells significant part human innate immune system, capable initiating “cytokine storms” see COVID-19. Mast cells triggered (among things) histamines. blocking histamines receptors mast cells, you’re able dampen cytokines storms improve mortality rates. Conspiracy theorist religious fanatics place making decisions me, I'd imagine whole lot people feel way. 

Sorry sorry. agree - needs go return back normal. Instead releasing nrusing homes? 

Yes, likely. slow down! People STILL eating restaurants obviously wearing masks, theres resturants Houston area almost full.. $$ lives guys Worse FB nominally ""real name"" users, human trash even bother hiding behind pseudo-anonymity anymore. disown instead? 

Embarrassing North Carolina resident honestly say waiting list mean exactly? I've heard lot I'm sure. someone sick enough need ICU bed put waiting list? care given waiting? reading. 


Antibodies fade alllll time. body business producing antibodies non stop.

If produced antibodies made memory b cells remember pathogen exposed convert plasma b cells go right back producing antibodies again.

On top cells also usually long term memory aggressive clear virus.


Any fucking twat says ""umm well antibodies fad thus immunity"" either fucking moron didnt pass college sophomore bio saying shit get attention. corona Nazi They're largest single denomination far smaller Protestants. 

I know Sabbath Saturday. I'm legitimately concerned amount incredibly obese people pictured rallys protests, I'm starting wonder anti mask crowd literally can't breathe general. would say churches (especially modern Protestant ones) likely worse movie theatres often long segments everyone singing. often choirs.

All *has to* much worse terms spreading virus. Fairfield here... everybody masked restaurant take set door people 6 feet wide parking lot.

Garden Catering chicken shack app CC pay, Google, walk door see bag name stepping in. Sweet. live like 

The day slip packy (it looks empty) 6'y Corona ponies barely notice guy following in.

The door goes dingy ding, clerk sight aisles, sticks shelf sez... ""Hey! 2 together? 1 allowed in"" ""YOU! Without mask, GET OUT!""

I turn see guy behind booking door.

Naturally verify never seen life sign good faith grabbed fifth Polish brandy help flagging sales.

I'm 60 health issues worried I'm death zone demographic. 

Fk guy he's done rest lives yet dare want slow spread north ? really incredible. countries shown deaths given inevitable. US literally killing thousands people day  Sales whopping 26%. sellers aren’t putting homes market much either. That’s prices haven’t budged much even gone areas. Anything say would get banned.

So thoughts prayers people Brazil. What's excuse gonna deaths spike like predicting? Testing much accessible, treatment improving, average age diagnosed COVID cases decreasing. would suggest we'll see spike cases, deaths. think churches especially bad. Many people standing close one building, singing, shaking hands, Catholic Churches every person dipping hands “holy” water. 

It’s like perfect conditions spread virus. lmao disease killing also made hallucinate saved her. didn’t disease wouldn’t need lifesaving hallucinations. Kinda funny works Swedes take personal affront someone criticise politics policy country. Mr Ten quite following make mission harass downvote article posts, add nicks day. (Including mine, got banned Swedish forum recently) strange breed. Ms Smith also one held mask burning protest, wants state stupid unhealthy is. contact tracer posted another thread recently they’ve already found plenty cases traced workers wearing masks breakrooms, even removing mask *once* near another C19-positive worker 😷 Florida will, apparently. right. went college US always thought Catholics protestants. heard subsects like wtf why? 
My best friend still college roommate lives Kansas speak atleast month. tried explaining like hey either buy white bread brown, everything else insignificant seeds top.
I guess every religion multiple shoots. own. find joy feeding stray dogs handing money poor people can.
I always used feel bad friends go church masjid whatever. usually fun things. Still guess.  think would virtually eradicate virus. US lot room improvement. Even general respect modest guidelines would produce case decline. Online bad. Last year mess done quickly prep. Heck could mix online person. would help social distance. thanks :) Well disagreement sure. see good way it.

Leaders knew early March, January, going around while. soon decided shut thinking open back fall, putting blinders assuming problem go away.

And statement Trump, he's one man broadly recognized moron fit lead. Congress, CDC, WHO, many others nearly useless. Whaaat? Ive eaten heard nothing this. mean didnt pay Im still outraged. Ps didnt read beyond headline airlines like google chrome tabs RAM tax dollars instead fucked. Anyone half brain see what’s going happen. Cases keep rising, Hospitals overwhelmed, jobs lost, people medical issues life, mass death, ptsd issues, states close mention kids drop school. change America forever. Stay safe. people test positive symptoms. like analogy I'm ignorant guy usa, really think guys handling things way handled. Saying cases trace control, need stop early. makes green envy. thank proving point.

Jesus, speed Light travel slow Churchland. tell that's first place go.

The protests outdoors, transmission much rare, much mask compliance, opposed churches OP enforced non-compliance, indoors.

MLK's protests called violent riots. Nevermind violence committed side, that's status quo. Whoever cops murder coming, world. Different blood types long known different cost benefit factors certain diseases. less vulnerable severe malaria (not immune sure), prone severe cases norovirus cholera. effects stronger level see COVID high?

california borders mexico; know malaysia map?

they land borders length entire us-mexico border could live world. spanish flu infectious died herd immunity around 33%. Look New York, they’re opening positivity rate 1%. Something you’d expect see close herd immunity. one cares. Unless ICU rona, simply exist. live beach south Florida, far people beach time last year. People stupid. meant 29 hours job 58. health insurance full time.  Actually lots churches electronic tithing still get offering without person worship.

Absolutely. institutions commended adapting current technology trends grow/keep thier member's safe engaged. 

But many also run/attended either aging ignorant individuals largely hold view ""computers bad"", want learn tech first place see empty pews lost donations. better let suffer painful death? freedom surely people shouldnt turned away wearing mask either?? Imagine many would died lockdown. 

You absolutley way prove efficiacy lockdowns. None. mention Paul told Christians submit governing authorities Romans. switched 17th century, probably due anti-semitism.

Uh, check history. Catholics Orthodox, oldest Christian churches, worshipped Sundays since earliest recorded times 2nd century, 1600s... think sign participate “reopen organizations,” fully waive rights ventilator case COVID beats ass. 

Why waste resources people don’t believe pandemic worth avoiding? I'm teacher (in Canada, however). even one student passes away shakes school surrounding community years. can't even fathom someone ok 5 kids per school. 

In grand scheme things missing year class education save lives worthy trade eyes. impact education negatively? Yes. worth families, schools communities severely traumatized political clout? Also Yes. *already* illegal? Fauci said avg age 15 years younger sun belt infected people. look fatality rate different age groups big disparities. 15 years younger average reduce fatality rate significant multiple. Doctors medical teams learned lot therapies treatments good deal better. NJ/NY cases probably understated testing beginning nearly available. skews fatality rate northeast. TX cases many came last two weeks? Deaths usually happen 21 days avg. die TX contracted last two weeks died yet. NY/NJ end metric. Give time it'll still good deal lower. mention word pandemic infection once. article OP once. No, normal, majority everyone else. fit media/reddit narrative. arguing fairy tales.

I pointing even consistent following fairy tales. Forget closing down, threatening end bri... campaign contributions would work wanted it. kind like curve sound wave turn loud probably would go higher capacity system render curve limited get distortion

And they're cranking 11 Florida. saw two posts SARS survivors sub. One said still breathing problems years later. said high school seemed triggered depression anxiety disorder.

Even there's mere risk long-term illness disability, need take seriously. There's many unknowns new virus doctors scientists still trying figure out. safe, sorry. I'm expert, believe create small amount antibodies help fighting another wave viruses make way body again. MILLINGTON, Mich. (WJRT) - Millington teenager fight life tonight.   

Ben Shreve, 15, beat COVID-19 diagnosed another complication, Multi-System Inflammatory Syndrome Children. Health organizations estimate 300 cases MIS-C country.  

“He headache, mostly, didn’t lose taste smell like did,” said dad, Gary Shreve. 
   
Gary soon-to-be wife, Kelly Blackmer, also got virus, along Ben’s brother step-father. Ben eventually tested negative, started drivers training working football. couple weeks later, came back.   
   
“He 105-degree temperature woke up. severe muscle pain, sore makes sense think it,” Gary said.   

“His skin hurt, hair hurt, couldn’t touch him,” says Kelly.    

He taken Children’s Hospital Michigan Detroit July 4th diagnosed Multi-System Inflammatory Syndrome Children, causes swelling pain various organs muscles. Many get infected previously exposed virus causes COVID-19.    

“They lot tests today see is, give road map next,” says Kelly.    

Ben ventilator showing signs improvement. family says received plenty support hometown Millington beyond.    

“We thankful, people kind generous heart prayer, means lot us,” says Kelly.    

Gary Kelly can’t see Ben hospital continue test positive coronavirus. Gary says pandemic began, wasn’t concerned.   

“I unafraid time, sick, talked Ben actually, Ben remember saying this, like was, yeah big deal. take back, big deal,” says.   
     
Ben’s mom Vicki bedside recovers hospital. Yeah spread virus thwart eventually.  they're cashing out. someone stand door tell customers they're allowed in. try come in, call police. Eventually message received. business free right now. Calling government orders way avoiding fallout customers unhappy. sad large corporations whatever order protect profits rather right thing. hallucinate what? saw comment history much get downvoted. hallucinate that. COVID goes 11 that’s artillery?

How maple syrup based booby traps defense? Partial opening really viable staying closed. DeBlasio fucking idiot. Type blood susceptible.


(that pretty much entire message link) I've come expect nothing /r/coronavirus. place starting feel astroturfed like /r/politics. censor anyone calling others it.

You're spouting nonsense thread thread even facts front eyes. I’m saying it’s shitty mindset “I don’t give two fucks get infect people” like wtf. I'm sure, think takes weeks infection get antibodies first place. exactly making point though. response black people disproportionately effected obesity. obesity people trying say. Also obesity 100% individuals control. many things factor overweight come eating. generally way I'm reading ""black people effected disproportionately due obesity thats fault."" know trying say like that. kinda spin around could obesity contributing. always ______s fault, system exactly set people succeed.  Oh that's great question.

I'm millennial definitely Great Recession really changed market. college graduating class Great Recession started better benefits pay. graduated, harder find jobs. jobs. ended working lot bad people lot bad things made uncomfortable. There's also another possibility - herd immunity. 

According recent studies, HIT 10-20%, virus burn loses ability infect people.

Scientists Oxford, Virginia Tech, Liverpool School Tropical Medicine, recently explained HIT COVID-19 paper:

*We searched literature estimates individual variation propensity acquire transmit COVID-19 infectious diseases overlaid findings vertical lines Figure 3. CV estimates comprised 2 4, range naturally acquired immunity SARS-CoV-2 may place populations herd immunity threshold 10-20% individuals immune.*

Calculations study [data showed HIT 17%.

This strategy was  [successfully Malmo, Sweden, fewer nursing home COVID-19 deaths parts Sweden assiduously protecting elder care homes.

Back May 4, Stanford’s Nobel-laureate Dr. Michael Levitt advocated Sweden’s approach letting COVID-19 spread naturally community arrive HIT. stated:

*If Sweden stops 5,000 6,000 deaths, know they’ve reached herd immunity, didn’t need kind lockdown. feeling probably stop herd immunity. COVID serious, it’s least serious flu. it’s going destroy humanity people thought.*

And that’s exactly happened. yesterday, 7 weeks prediction, Sweden 5,447 deaths. Deaths Sweden PEAKED HIT halfway peak (roughly 7.3%) time virus hit 14% nearly extinguished.

A similar study Sweden released shows “roughly twice many people developed T-cell immunity compared detect antibodies in.”

The data Diamond Princess shows similar resultm, 17% people board tested positive, despite ideal environment mass spread, implying 83% people somehow protected new virus.

This shows positive cases Sweden, tracked deaths. There’s correlation. US politicians seem less less rational though. yell “church gatherings matter what” others call “closing unnecessary gatherings religion” advocate dense protesting. lot natural things still kill though.

Like, know, virus? protestors money grab like churches. business infecting people paying taxes ill gotten gains seems like last thing need pandemic. god wants open stop infecting people house prayer. Simple that. Let's face it, churches pay bills one goes...that's probably real issue here. Sheep need someone lead em.

That majority human race.

No clue young little seen around world people.
But fact.

You cant fix stupid however show door,open shove em in. people idiots, rest America paying freedumb lives. Hope it’s worth it. (Hint: it’s not) They're fed governor trying protect arrested daring step sidewalk, yet Cooper rolled red carpet Marxist Antifa movements rioters destroyed streets statewide,"" Smith said. ""Where justice?""

🤪 hallucinate that? pray cancer, give money. churches, protest gatherings ""fuck want"" parties give ton people Darwin awards. Density play much big factor think

 Annoying turned yet another sub anti trump U.S politics Heres problem, matter what, ultimately pastor telling people, including young children, dont follow words old compilation book forever burn hell. tells without rational probable evidence, children forced believe nature young age.


No matter spell it, going wrong, must admit look outside perspective, things say crazy, things less every mega scandal church crazyperson church, there's approximately 2-3 pretty much ok-ish. Saying ""all churches terrible churches make news usually garbage"" like saying atheists murderers totalitarians Stalin CCP exist.

Thats terrible argument atheist doesnt come innate values.

Its literally dont believe god. Thats it. Nothing else.

Being Christian hand says lot person believe god. means exactly changes person person, point remains same. Tbf lot places outside Denver anti mask. one diner opened Mother’s Day proudly anti mask/social distancing. I’m Denver suburb go Target right 1/3 people won’t wearing masks. This. company could mandate face masks worn stores tomorrow wanted to. could remove customers adhere policies. Making government lazy way around company look bad, politicians do.  lag time ridiculous. knew meant see someone could misunderstand. edit may help. Stay well safe! Getting serious whiplash WH narrative here.

Last week said new focus would ""living virus""

So far week president picked fight CDC school safety guidelines, threatened pull federal funding schools open day classes, VP contradict day made threats. heard NYTimes article week may vascular rather respiratory autopsies found people COVID thousands small blood clots body. Didn’t know ACE-2 receptors though. Thanks! here. I've seen HD employees customers wearing masks several trips I've made 2 different locations. also plexiglass barriers customers stationary workers like cashiers (plus lots self checkout lines). teachers. NYC lost several spring. fair, experts agreed unlikely virus created / modified lab, virus origin sound like something grave importance. mean - let's think it, would change anything back could confirm virus originated China? Spain? US? country world? 

I think wrong that, limited time had, WHO's team experts focused more... technical (?) aspects virus, RI, CFR, main transmission mode, etc. probably helped us way trying figure came from, least layman's perspective.  Italy lockdown meant police actively patrolling fining people valid reason outside. 

I believe US would ever impose methods. W want virus get bored lose interest. Idk mean that, website released two different numbers. least one must wrong, 52k figure supported covidtracking (which John hop uses source) like said 60k stat cherry-picking imo Wisconsin - Froedtert&amp;MCW got results 24-36 hours Let’s honest— would greater good. 

If recovers convince millions people hydroxychloroquine works shouldn’t worried virus. Trump threatened cut funding? Sounds respectful. even that? think edmonton would allowed go out. remember rockies selling point edmonton's bid, barely saw actual city presentation lol glad getting 1.2%- many companies frozen salaries indefinitely. go affect year. firm belief people able gather places worship.

Sincerely, National Atheists Association Wow that’s long wait, girl CVS said 4-5 business days Someone watched many Troma Films releases... Think perspective, truly believe virus hoax dangerous like flu need ""rules"" ""restrictions"" keep children ""safe"".

If, want think like president liter vodka bash head concrete wall concussion ""logic"" become clear.

Vice President Mike Pence later announced CDC issuing five new documents next week contain guidelines schools parents ""tough"" existing ones. 

Translation: eviscerate new guidelines point they'll become useless preventing spread children. We'll bludgeon local districts re-open watered rules threats withholding funding. children eventually get sick we'll blame districts following earlier tougher guidelines ones meant follow along.  Saw trump
On Twitter saying wants schools open August??
Do guys even speak or? even asking covid patients protests, exactly studying? Yea, know. Tell vast majority fellow “Christians” America would call Antifa citing awkward bits Bible. christians henpick choose believe “Don’t misunderstand come. come abolish law Moses writings prophets. No, came accomplish purpose. tell truth, heaven earth disappear, even smallest detail God’s law disappear purpose achieved. ignore least commandment teach others same, called least Kingdom Heaven. anyone obeys God’s laws teaches called great Kingdom Heaven. warn you—unless righteousness better righteousness teachers religious law Pharisees, never enter Kingdom Heaven!” — MATTHEW 5:17-20 Pence said news though get funding New Link:

The rest USA hand. LMFAO Yeah I've googling I'm starting think I'm idiot Yes did. US really shamed responded this. see brand new, teacher-hating accounts spamming topic.

In los angeles, dangerous start schools, period. virus control, open bars, restaurants schools. consequence opening bars LA County, majority hospitalized people young adults. open schools right now, kids 17. Wow Trudeau, way set bar high there... /s Grocery stores pretty much open whole time. super spreaders? Yeah, usual biased studies. reckon that's issue sides, biased studies downplaying oversizing impact virus has. Referring third person really cheesy. , today Far? think trump fantastic job 

I fantastic beach front property Nebraska you’re interested 15 years younger average reduce fatality rate significant multiple. 

that's henry ford hcq study looked great one took peek age disparity Essential employees put way much. made realize essential another word expendable. look developed nations bad back April May like Italy, UK, France etc virus somewhat control now. Case numbers deaths way peak. US seems one that's seen massive surge. code sic maga mob mean nobody understands arrows floor grocery store either, kind hot mess adults apparently skipped Kindergarten shapes day. I’ve trying wear black mask provided us fit “uniform” it’s barely thicker T-shirt. 104.5 fever enough reason go though? conservatives argue bad faith. Similar Russian bounty story, Trump said A) true B) true, never told C) true, told, ok.  Number 1! Number 1! 
......

Huh? Oh DONT want leader this? cutting funding. alright long polite it. Everyone saw coming. 

Let’s rebrand Coronavirus “the churches bars pandemic”. Wow, I'm really sorry hear that. That's lot deal with. hope able find treatment helps well. Thanks sharing experience 3.0 now, right? I'm Gen X/Millennial border, neither elementary school junior high AC, exception new addition junior high went there. was, pointed out, miserably hot weeks every year. pretty well-funded suburban school district state actually cares education, too. I'm sure still case I've stepped foot elementary school vote recently seen inside junior high since last day 9th grade, could certainly see still plenty schools without AC, especially older buildings use boiler heat. husband’s office NWF allowed WFH month March....then boss told needed come back in. change layout, 6 chairs space size master bathroom, one team member wearing masks.

These people far rabbit holes. shares 79% genetic make SARS-COV

Human beings share 84% genetics Dogs. Hell, share 70% genetics Chickens. also share 44% genetics Bananas.

So telling two viruses 79% genetically similar means jack shit me. Declaring creed equals membership? Christian already paying fees Church US online services never stepped foot German church? subsidy forcefully collected non members. lot issues study. article presents results, else new science press release

1. Like lot “how long virus survive” studies either don’t list much virus used and/or use way much compared would present naturally.

2. tested virus using pcr. valid method says nothing infectivity. simply states reaction antigen, remains infectious

3. study used closed environment keep particles aerosolized. also natural environment

So yes, think study interesting. absolutely valid conclude cov2 spreads aerosols. case tuberculosis/measles type virus would much higher spread. primary transmission route wide margin human human contact around 3 meters 10-15 minutes. transmission trend would see aerosolized virus claimed Texas closing back up. That’s false. claimed Florida’s ICU’s hitting capacity that’s false. you’re spreading false info understand religion good thing there's way negative associated terms segregation, racism, bigotry, exclusion, improper beliefs morals. Frankly, folks decided go bars restaurants pandemic irresponsible. enough common sense stay home. thing vote November. take personal precautions. Well that's used /s studies take place type controlled environment, though, results remain relative. virus clearly stronger resilient. Ok, go middle east reason everyone put books.

You cannot purge religion without purging base plans continue online learning like end year. wife discussed neither us would feel comfortable sitting classroom hours, we're certainly going make kids it.  Even kids generally lower risk, there's huge potential teachers staff get sick, ***then*** what's plan? testing, thought hoax?! Come Corona. Let's see do. church leader needs outed embarrassed nationally. would community service. throwaway. religious healers, scam artists peddle impossible product personal wealth power.  They're definitely extremely bad, especially congregations full people are...less likely wear masks. flip side, people church hour week usually. 

Schools. horde petri dishes going congregating thousands 8 hours day

Any state that's bringing kids back needs rethink baseless hopes immediately Shut Mike. one listening you. (stupid) Religious people die!

a fucking WIN WIN!

Love ""self cleaning"" Lol okay Texas TRUE death rate Florida? 

You can't call ""pneumonia"" deaths completely ignore COVID Republican agenda. Nice try though Trumpette. Listen everyone needs bury head sand pretend everything fine. sooner pretend virus big deal sooner go back normal life. excuse need go dig graves backyard Well deaths continue drop, despite fact cases continued rise month now. sure is, deaths continue go down, important number seems state pandemic/disease.  sure hope not. working air conditioner 6 years  looked .ca part domain name figured 😅 fill water piranhas Church attendees dying breed. Literally. kids call ""no funding"" days? u/Pokono, artigo foi eliminado. Tens outras fontes? Alot Churches like small businesses. larger group allows open church members members pay tithes offerings stay open pastor receive financial support larger group. Weird fucked system comes money. Microdosing COVID? Someone get Joe Rogan line! reported Associated Press well. USA, paying attention? could argue middle class first class normies, again, profit there.

That's called economy plus/premium economy long haul exists. pretty much selling 1990s coach experience domestically 34"" seats domestic first class seats/meals international long haul. article 

There’s scientific study linked cited within article. Please read things reply. need open schools cut unemployment make people go back work  Prescribing antibiotics viral infection... Np, well!! need know someone wearing mask things like complaint? excuses global pandemic.

While yes minute part population may able wear mask consistently, vast majority people wearing making complaints selfish. comment specifically make excuses people wearing mask?

Your comment spreading awareness medical needs. strictly selfishness chose clarify whether wore mask despite called out. clarified also mocked person calling out.

So again, ask, intent comment convey intent? jet won’t fuel itself, now, it? new talking point guys gonna go with? What? recognize mask people wear little nothing?

I respect others wishes request wear one near place business. change fact masks act placebo.

I never stated people wear masks somehow makes things worse. means continue Masquerade (pun intended) Costco demanded people wear masks months ago. 

Can major retailers same? pretty damn simple someone entrance handing masks blocking anyone entering without them. need state mandate? rules confusing you, company, come said ""we protecting workers customers require facial coverings shopping Target/home depot/whatever"". 

These guys cry government intervention make decision alienate morons want government take fall. CDC that, absolutely credibility left. withdraw CDC? Nope, subsidy comes state budget everyone's taxes paid into. thing member fee german catholic church (evangelic church too, probably others - religious organisation could use it), collected state's tax bureaucracy transfered church. 

It's paid german state budget paid anyone self-register church member (i think going rites, w/e they're called - case declaring membership). opt time (unlike taxes). mean winning same- also auto. explanation given, come back time. Look largest BLM rallies were. soaring cases COVID Florida, Texas Arizona. absolutely could. axis sunshine! think stupid protests (that banned) bigger source infections. mom's hospital Florida ICU patients covid related. exact number, though. said weird- seems like non-covid ICU patients they'd normally time year. Maybe people avoiding hospitals ailments get really bad, maybe people recovering covid sort clotting complications something, maybe covid patients make seem busier normal... idea. Exactly. arrested “indecent exposure”. wearing mask cited “irresponsible exposure”. Arguably, random swinging dick sights would less dangerous someone’s naked mouth breathing personal space. Better him, I'm sure. like either, think nearly reckless idiotic. Legally, can. Sorry I’m fan communism 650 infections = safe

Sorry compute all. akin divide zero. Arizona. They've gone record saying enforcing it. Fucking assholes. sister doc Stanford, I'll ask people think guy saying lately lol. Due BLM protesters person fiance knows tried compare mask mandates masks slaves forced wear. utter lunacy people knows bounds. know we've come much population utterly inured facts interminably selfish. always one day week WFH. departments got 2. Since March 100% WFH think lot people opposed originally love it. go back work 2 days week another phased opening month so. don’t think I’ll office till spring. hearing talking permanently making WFH maybe 3 days week. old ancient stubborn company even changing. Oh that’s great hear. I’m going honest I’m super familiar laws work.  Guessing still critical PM, probably happy Alberta Ontario premiers. Alberta similar population Oregon (one better Covid19 states) 20% fewer total cases, despite ideologically one conservative provinces country. think depends district/political leanings. district full speed ahead opening accommodations made besides parents allowed campus. district states majority teachers parents want, small number people I've talked would prefer smaller class size instead 5 days week model. misspoke made fault? sound like manager.

You: Here's information X

Me: Information X meaningless

You: dumb calling X meaningless actually meant Y

By stating need understand X, conceded point, X useless information. starts school mid July? got out! guess think time would better spent fighting things like UBI halt non-essential work keep parents home watch kids worry risking getting virus themselves.

We could fighting that, instead fighting open schools. 

If open schools people can't afford childcare work even risk whole family getting virus, parents kids could potential carriers. 

Opening schools would hurt poor anyone else, kill poor anyone else. rich online schools anyway, know idea safe risk kids, want poor kids parents back work.

I sympathy people stuck position. think opening schools solution, it'll make already awful situation worse. Modernize money collecting like lot businesses do. know lacks personal touch (and guilt trip eyes watching). Like many preachers appears clue (and possibly education) preaches (or least give shit it) instead wants spread version ""truth"". power control. money. know guy whose church preaches everybody goes hell follow version Bible. Bibles wrong. Power Control. best way control people fear. ""Do say face consequences"". way many preachers praying preying gullible. getting away it. English pretty bad atheist, fail see issue here..... work urban school NJ third floor AC. gets hot! raised loving Humanist-Christian church. It’s fun make Southern Baptist heads explode mentioning Jesus parents dark brown refugees fled Egypt without papers. You’re sweet, thank you. It’s weird think people don’t issues don’t think it. everything keep others safe. wish best stay safe! doubt cases rising then? Much rising case numbers U.S. Florida Texas. believe numbers like ones like? Quick, everyone go church pray!!! lol no, they’d never passionate education. mall maybe. supply money, there's way big school districts guidelines. thing happened NY. obvious answer, course. shocking

 ^(/s) social media platforms echo chambers, people need see see it. see things like masks lower blood O2 levels. Ugh disgusts me. I'm sorry, nobody put situation. GF stay two weeks? UK generally considered authoritarian society yet gone far require masks settings social distancing impossible like crowded public transport.

Constitutional unusually strong power American local governments imposing reaction unsurprising. Back March sure matter bad got kind place we'd something like require masks. camt smoke ganja...mad panic attacks ensue..... course. I'm sorry ask haha Churches small businesses need pay taxes. Especially since don’t practice much teachings Jesus. kids? Yes did. learn goddamn thing many younger kids suffered lot fear depression.

For parents absolutely awful unless course lost job case could give kids full attention. It’s people can’t read, it’s people don’t read. might open article skim it. many people take time read actual research.

I get though, takes time thought work article, especially you’re practiced it. take issue people work repeating invalid conclusions. misinformation spreads ugly laughed literally person actually clicked link. Holy shit South Carolina August 17th. still announced form (in person, online, hybrid model). Sorry, issue private business spending ton money create bubble isolated general public? That’s kid thing makes church become accurately described cult. God makes want steal valve cores lmao Well 650 cases leaving place got spreading general public days even realize they're sick. since we've seen exponential growth, 650 cases seems like hot bed. That's 16.25 people per church going spread it. next week they'll come back spread people attending mass go spread more.

Honestly 650 cases desensitized that? countries 3 *potential* cases panic ensues, lockdown sets steps traced everyone knows happened.

650 horrific. church producing 5x amount infected scenario literally nothing it. Looks like Florida dethroned  thought Id share experience. LaQuinta seemed good choice. 

Lots seemingly Covid patients/isolaters. floor least 5 rooms large garbage bags simply placed hallway outside door collected, along towels sheets. 

My room wasnt clean all. One bed found dark hairs. wiped surfaces myself. Grounds well kept garbage could found place. 

In addition, seems ""down luck"" groups people living long/medium term. normally business travelers hotel, judging location reviews. least groups took fire safety seriously. fire alarm went every hours, would stay fire dept showed up. loud.

Only considered dialing 911. lady screaming ""STOP"" child wailed, abruptly stopped 10 mins though. 

Im thinking maybe AirBB next scheduled break. Pretty sure ""mark beast"" morons pivot moment claim anyone get covid struck deal satan. almost like close groups people best way spread contagious virus. knew.

Oh right everyone did. Shhhh don’t say that. deaths continue drop never spike they’ll find another excuse know people without jobs now? hire mask enforcement personnel. patrol streets hit people cash fines. People wake start kind environment. felt guilty leaving empty popcorn bucket cinema, could never throw face mask gloves anything bin. responsibility dispose correctly! 

I watched man threw McDonald's waste car driving including drink looked full! Wtf wrong ass holes?   Doctors medical teams learned lot therapies treatments good deal better

Thanks. know articles talk more? good news! think mean 15. 15 soon, 15 going zero. Dude NC tell people’s political stands walking Foodlion. people think ideological issue really it’s practical issue.

Parents live children, grandparents usually don’t live grandchildren. Therefore, parents decline facilitate relationship grandparents grandkids, doesn’t really matter grandparents think rights are. It’s happening. really see I'm assume, annoying every reddit sub anti trump stuff I'm UK. Never used political slavery

Right single article make claim factual. States come admitted protests caused (in part) spike cases. It’s absolutely ridiculous. Contract tracers weren’t allowed ask people tested positive covid attended protest. you’ve got people virus standing shoulder shoulder people streets scattered mask use? that’s dangerous can’t outside sporting events happen then? parks ever closed? mental gymnastics done deny protests anything current uptick cases truly staggering me. I’m one people advocating allow things like anyway blatant hypocrisy going right put edge. oh look found one clearly read comments end. clear agenda broad brush like paint people with. 

I believe news editors agendas biases shape gets aired/written. coverage pandemic recent example it.

As regards approach taken, neither measures used. believe missing public pronouncements element time. use experience prior pandemic diseases predictive current future ones, need acknowledge plan corresponding time frame need deal with. 2-3 year time frame used planning scenarios. also predicted timeline discussed months ago several epidemiologist read working covid19. Since new pathogens definition well known, science inexact, assumptions could prove incorrect. k-12 schools closed like four months earlier year issue?

Did world collapse? die field brimstone hellfire? least 25 30 feet away masks

This probably overkill, seems right you, guess.

I'm pro-mask, anti-contact anyone outside (*very* small) social bubble. 15 feet outside really plenty. someone cough, maybe mask good idea. whole thing stupid. Retailers want mask mandate point finger policy perfectly able implement enforce themselves.

 masky shoppy. already admitted that. one refuses learn definition herd immunity give butt pats dumbass. 

Blocked.  Yeah sub fucking joke. It’s full mouth breathers podunk towns treat anti-Facebook counter boomer attitudes intense fear. 

Like get it, every action reaction sides feed other. it’s annoying it’s done bad faith. Yes did. chose upvote nothing say. Say ain't so? Deaths reported? But, random Birx 25% comment, probable deaths, vent$$$$$, 5G, Elvis!

Yes, deaths covid counted, evidence crazy conspiracy theories counted.

 we'll see. Sweden screwed badly killed many citizens even US worse assured. mountain another side it? heard someone say hospitalizations going heard might second wave stimulus money. get money covid cases hospitals. cracked case! 🙄 point, even matter. Actually everyone know germany italy france agree.

 Im canadian, everyone work understands new norm. girlfriends school seems think new norm. Friends family agree. people denial. Florida allowing distance learning though schools open want option person school.

Ultimately looking like called county level. Miami Date already decided, Palm Beach deciding today 2pm. think schools counties may open, see lot students least initially. think almost anyone would handled better Trump. Good. people brain damaged ignore guidelines get even brain damaged darwin pick off.

Sad people affected dolts though many years people get full story, day day heard conspiracy actually believe. doubt ever proven disproven, believe ""let's roll"" happened time fighter jets fired plane. 

i remember february made separate bets two friends covid would biggest news story life time, one gave bet early april declaring winner taking phone calls anymore lol agree answer!!! good news allowed r/coronavirus! know there's conspiracy deaths underreported?!! 2 weeks! wait, 3-7 weeks... wait. Forever. including recent Spanish seroprevalence study estimated IFR 1% 1.3% — triple highest estimate review.""

this. good studies done due dilligence support ridiculous estimates. similarly could say anti-lockdown protests, eating friends, going nightclubs, etc. events might able tied large growth cases, plenty others not. LOOL guess BC hear 100's people crossing border EVERYDAY using ALASKA LOOPHOLE eh? 

We also constantly declining Alberta US citizens campgrounds. (I live tourist town work tourist stop along freeway) amount USA citizens stopped. still serve Washington plated vehicles everyday. business group follow CDC guidelines prevent spread virus held liable recklessness.

No wonder certain party scrambling add indemnity 2nd stimulus bill. make sure pay stupidity. Thanks, wish people; humans, would listen, stop worshipping death live. new ""it's gonna gone April"" saying reputable scientific journal explored use chemicals found evidence helpful treating preventing disease?

I disagree people touting oils herbs cure agree irresponsible. also fan statement paper linked however I'm disregard thoughtful paper chock full quantitative research chemical analysis one (albeit very) unscientific adverb.


Here's meta study BMJ data seem indicate that B serrata extracts effective treating range conditions caused maintained inflammatory processes."" never justified anything blocking road *is* law. factual statement. also made fact said protesting isnt constitutional right. Turns things true.

Its also different topic I'm glad acknowledged wrong fabricating stats.  Leave can. America beyond saving.

Anti-intellectualism complete disdain humanity poisoned society government past point redemption.   Non pharmaceutical interventions. AKA lockdowns masks. I've working home since March. Data Analyst. I've taking mad dabs shatter lockdown. BHO actually purges lungs COVID Lol miracle ass. Hah! Religion/god nothing this.

This due persistent efforts Italian Government, local populations, healthcare workers. Calling miracle bullshit. we're getting florida numbers now? Kick store refuse. Call cops wont leave. File trespassing charge fight. Right? I’m Florida, there’s way hell I’m carrying like everything ok. fact, I’ve locked harder there’s lot risk now. 

I can’t let guard I’m bored. Yes - catch chicken pox, virus life?

god damn, pinning even basic fact difficult. try slither slide way it. like trying discussion snake oil salesman. here. I've accepted fact responsible actions everybody else. realized could really helped stress levels. supposed sound it. thread still trying. he's Stanford, i'm keyboard warrior realize states running beds ER cause Covit 19. Agree. One kid’s classmates sick virus years ago whole school rallied him. He’s basically celebrity among student body now. great hard go awhile. 

The thought teacher one student dying would devastating. trying rationalize handful lives worth trade off. 

Idk. I’m always shocked every time get FB. People Texas can’t even get tested, boyfriend tried week ago options. wouldn’t surprised people dying home, especially save families crippling medical debt. It’s sad situation around. they’ll ask “how get here” hearts attacks could caused coronavirus, know people without covid? 5-10x CFR flu probably contagious, permanent organ injuries. flu bro. No, changed city name make sure could keep up. hope too. visited Carnaval worst hit town Belgium (country highest death rate). i'm pretty sure early, 3 months later showed anti bodies.

I sad can't get old healthy way hoped.

My heart beat increased 10 BPM since sick slowly goes again. hope temporary non hospital corona. headline misleading worded way scare people believing virus remains airborne hours.

This experiment simply shows forced remain air rotating drum, virus survive hours. live rotating drum, natural environment, virus tends settle onto surfaces, already know need cleaning regularly kill thing. Fuck, family lives Phoenix Coronazona That’s big tower gets lab supe makes us throw Well according people FB, they're tagging every death covid. 🙄 deadly ya know?! common cold still around every cold-like illness probably Covid-19 ? greater chance cold like illness common cold rather Covid-19? I’m 99% sure Arkansas manipulating numbers. 

Their official numbers turned sharply last weeks, Arkansas culturally similar Southern states seeing surges cases. There’s nothing special Arkansas would make outbreak play differently FL, GA, NC, TN, TX OK. Florida reported unheard number pneumonia deaths since February. like 3x year last decade. hiding stuff recently, ongoing. There's much winning coming US days conversation them, regardless topic = ""BUT BLACKFACE"" bought much US. pretend everything always context; always add ""/s"" honestly imagine happening point. Seems like self-terminating problem That’s insane... dealt cancelling Adobe hard enough. 

I’m glad got money back, fuck making difficult middle pandemic Exploded? think pressuring CDC change guidelines. select guidelines want's followed; telling change like telling math teacher need say 2+2 = 5 It’s sad need use pee joke tell people wear mask.  Mentioned article:

""Critics charge based calculations flawed studies. question selection studies — including deaths healthy blood donors, instance, including recent Spanish seroprevalence study estimated IFR 1% 1.3% — triple highest estimate review."" Get restaurants open! Shit, I'm Pagan local group work meeting online since March. Several us compromised immune systems, couple us medical professionals, we're taking chances.

Our community rituals attract 25 50 people canceled vaccine safe things again. supposed run couple intensive courses year permanently postponed 2021 minimum. Every single conference festival supposed go spring, summer, fall postponed 2021 gone virtual year. Almost every pagan group know responding similar manner. 

How tiny minority religion many ways even mystical magic-oriented Pentecostal evangelicals acting way sane rational Christians? “Where Governor Ron DeSantis go apology?” Agreed, would interesting data check (of course could factors well), useful check sure. I'll damned can't quote chaper verse men laying men. population dense areas country (in order) NYC, LA, philly, miami, boston, chicago, san fran, DC, pitt, louisville. 

i would guess NYC seen worst going get. LA san fran probably getting close, DC peak guess we'll wait till election season see next one worse, others? miami surely peaked yet, neither louisville, philly pitt

edit: cities wrong order, represent top 20 Either god real he's total asshole -- pick. mean kinda hard travel anywhere every country banning usa travelers warp back April? 

Seriously I'm dejavu. Blame both. Consumers still choice. proper ways dispose things. reusable protection items. ways limit need masks.

They also responsible. Yes hold companies accountable, considers without choice. Quatre-vingt-dix-neuf sobbed frenchman ""An office dying. office place dreams come true.""

-Michael Scott don’t know opinion country ever recover. I’m embarrassed live here. Wrong. Wrong. Wrong. 
As proof, see Louisiana. 
Now explain. hottest hot takes. Sure, kind basics taking? Basics bio (dna rna) viriology? starting basically. Also specific questions I'll dig papers answer best can


Edit: lol automod removing comments... childcare school setting, cluster defined least five cases within 14-day period.

Health officials calling “cluster” rather “outbreak” setting, makes harder figure spread happened whether occurred within facility community. Scott Atlas propagandist god sends us knowledge viruses pandemics, sends masks available almost everyone, sends us ability quarantine ourselves, gives us rational mind make good judgement cases. Yet thumb noses great gifts turn backs god insisting know better. everyone behaved like functioning adults really much rage-induction either community. Evangelizing Christians part faith, non-believing human say end things there. Likewise, evangelizing Christians also told try force people believing, entrust results evangelism God (paraphrased). responsibility sharing it.

Both sides religion divide reality stupid fuck. Atheists raging someone shared religion childish, trying shove religion someone else's face equally stupid. need chill fuck out. Agreed. work retail city masks required. Still maybe 25% don’t masks walk door. see sign front door, go back car get it. literally car don’t wear unless basically forced. don’t give away masks, instead try help remotely best possible. local sheriff stated Facebook would enforcing mask laws, either. real problem easily spreads people showing symptoms yet still spread virus. we're seeing hospitals starting fill quickly enough people get infected mortality rate increase hospitals offer limited amount care. prosecuted premeditated murder.

You guys really gone deep end.

So everyone else wearing mask last year flu season, rounded up?  Checks graph peeks American idiocy. Checks out. want people go bars open them. idea personal responsibility joke dealing health emergency. Leadership means make hard decisions ensure safety people.  mention empirical data shows ""harmless flu 70"" objectively false. People really need learn basic sanity checking. get feeling large overlap flat earth, antivax, craziness. http://www.vaticanobservatory.va/content/specolavaticana/en.html

I time go website seems student programs public access.

This website amazing. straight 90's updated well mobile devices updated least annual reports. i'd surprised low. yeah know cdc shows like 70k excess beyond covid called excess already % normal Threatens cut funding schools says nothing “small businesses” took funding PPP loans shouldn’t received them... opening total disaster, cases go up, children react differently set lifetime deal affects covid, time tell make want call self atheist anymore. Gross. Outlawing religion would definitely work. Going cocaine analogy, war drugs worked everybody? well all. like kinda evangelizing atheist. decide wait now, something keep coming delays desire change. I'm even black, go every protest historic movement. current protests hopefully germination legitimate systemic change. frankly, what's point trying best stop virus US laughably ignorant population developed world. Half people wearing masks even cover nose, rural town half people wearing masks. US deserves devastated pandemic, laughing stock free world takes combination events truly make shitty Rome fall, it. Hell, Trump administration probably even good thing expedite exposure America's police state. I’ll say good chunk. Hey I’m happy neighbors least mask compliant protesting anti masks. Wear masks convince everyone know wear them. Avoid large gatherings convince everyone know avoid them. Continue wash hands avoid picking nose rubbing eyes unwashed hands. Use social media engage idiots you’re connected convince idiots. can’t even put words pathetic disgustingly selfish something like is. wear damn mask ya plague rat.  exaggeration unscientific. 

It certainly exaggeration make clear things happen small percentage people.

Don't dumb things American people. Tell American people truth, without holding anything back, let people decide want. Nice. wasn’t awful, hard sell threatening-sounding like companies would do. idea asked way, shape form refund answer glaringly obvious. Plus knowledge planning vacation started time last year, think, way even first case Wuhan reported always get comprehensive travel insurance get sick sometimes always make sure travel cancellations health reasons always specifically included. tell FL, TX etc largely opportunity vote safety net presidential elections. construct 2 party system, likely never safety net speak of.

We select safety net US, poor &amp; wealthy, middle, fucked. Actually Houston Public Media ran story April, said people conditions avoiding hospital suicides. point is, church members! Why?

Because fucking doctors scientists!

The decision open remain closed never make. 

We middle public health crisis. Idiots! shit's sad u see people say something like ""we're tired, summer already"" maybe even ""i believe it, almost every sickness written covid make us feel scared"" guys paying it? gonna try get Mexicans pay for? hiring laborers? Daddy looking job. think understand woven cloth mask large holes size cars compared particles carry viruses, masks nose fittings even filter air breathe out, air goes around mask though it. Kleenex safer woven cloth mask non-woven fiber. flimsy useful mask.

Fauci literally lying says cloth masks protective (of others) coronavirus. person (educated not) actually thinks hear instead blindly believing authority figures see that. Fauci's mask b.s. makes part problem random person brain randomly listens says, see he's telling truth. People go along program they're lied to.

Until people start demanding competence honesty public health leaders, we'll continue worst country developed developing world comes public health epidemics. like we're already world leaders obesity lifestyle disease epidemics similar reasons professional integrity competence public health care leadership. said thing got voted. secret? Hey, let’s give airline industry welfare though! Let’s drug test execs make sure aren’t spending drugs long you’re protesting correct thing aren’t public health risk? That’s point. People shamed protesting message wasn’t something media wanted get behind, fine since message BLM something couldn’t speak against. That’s false equivalency. That’s hypocrisy. dad's 66 year old music teacher (so lots touching, blowing, work covid times), definitely planning retiring year, may sit one come back one year band orchestra rooms scary fuck. think lot churches, mine, depend mostly donation. maybe churches want money greed, rather keep running. whole conversation fucking insane.

Remember hated anti-vaxxers agreed plague society?

In Texas 1,200 voters, 86 percent Democrats, 73 percent Republicans, 67 percent independents supported mandatory immunizations.

But less support mandatory masks.

Let repeat different way

**More Texans 2019 supported forcing parents allow state inject chemical concoctions children 2020 support wearing removable piece cloth corona-hole 1 hour Target**

I'm done country named cities states, pick pitt (alleghany) see cases last week 5x peak deaths expected rise soon, philadelphia (county) cases risen past first peak yet could put ""maybe"" category ones could past peak, original peak never brought covid deaths even daily first place among leading cause. cities peaked temporary periods covid leading cause. That's 36k cases/day.

We've 50-60k/day recently, next million going take long all. research conducted artificial, laboratory-type setting didn’t factor real-word conditions like UV light wind, Roy believes findings practical implications. Conservative Andrew Scheer majority government would given us one-time cheque, coronavirus middle finger. Thank fuck Trudeau. Even minority government, he's handled best anyone could have, despite else may hear. 
Staunch conservatives and/or morons disagree. rest us know serious support doctor expert opinions public safety. stop pretending actual death toll well 200k point? silliness - rise Texas hospitalizations totally unrelated Coronavirus zero correlation rise cases?

Amazing every country going along scheme embarrass president. also part says something like ""when 2 gathered name, there"", course butchered verse meaning need temples practice religion.

Yes, know sucks service Mass feels good, killing bunch fellow churchgoers it, right. 

At least country churches comply, US seems everyone goes rampant. saw facebook post american cousin relatives complaining churches limiting people enforcing masks, like dude, least bare minimum, close online services. I'm able keep children home online learning, they're older, thankfully. go back work, spouse. feel like we'll back work long enough get sick, one us laid off. Retail manager here. pretty difficult. Added normal job make sure many people once, employees customers, following safety procedures. employees pretty good. forget gloves something, need remind sanitize. customers either super nice terrible. awesome see. Much like New York, etc. went battle rest bit. sad states US learned New York (and Italy). amazing apparently learn lesson going ourselves. guess ""It happen here."" mindset. Except mask protects HIM. That's sort happens safety net job. doesnt matter watch people crumble due exertion, clear corporations want use replace without thought, job mercy circumstance, keep working hopes weather storm. grade-school obvious covering mouth good one terms spreading airborne diseases. adults society trouble accepting simple fact. idiot Wow, retweeting HCQ propaganda. turn AmUriCa! person could also blame China things, time blame government failings :) industry location? surprised_pikachu.png Great, cut funding schools, could better? cant stores make temporary policy mandate masks? power We'll see one two weeks. Honestly. current ""leader"" shit like encouraging anti maskers seizing ppe Oh got it, think virus operates strict time table. variables (maybe young people take longer die? Maybe healthcare strategies better?).

So TX AZ seeing death rate increases past strict 1 week window? 

Your whole argument falls apart based (death rates increasing several states). 

You can’t seem answer question: makes think LA special going go path Texas Arizona?

Especially considering two weeks ago people like predicting Texas Arizona wouldn’t go path New York has...yet are. Last sunday church city kind rave inside, row 8 people side side entrace. Would bet around 70 people packed inside rows Ioannidis? even know start. paper best described sloppy worst deliberate attempt spreading misinformation. reports wrong IFR Brazil paper, use many best serology studies, uses dodgy papers like Iran one, uses 1st wave estimates LA county contradicted 2nd wave, uses single F'ing high school Oise estimate prevalence whole city, on. paper absolute dross.

Probably preaching choir sub saying. mandate force law made pursuant governor's authority California Emergency Services Act. incredibly arrogant thing say, it’s actually true, it’s time go it’s time go.

Graduation still 10-11 months away. may different (hopefully better) world allow prom graduarion. Sweden ever switch herd immunity approach? could actually good news US totally agree. feel like avoiding exposure impossible point. I'm trying decrease viral load much possible reducing exposure keeping immune system strong fight whatever come contact with. I'm right pandemic.

It sucks individual research create plan survival. government, turn many dimmest citizens, even acknowledge virus anymore. live it, say. brother lives Arizona it, hasn’t gotten test back yet lost sense smell days saw patient tested positive works yes, current rate. needs country wide initiative, door door business whatever every single person tested.

That's unfortunately true ignoring fauci, could imagine doctor stage wear mask promotes herd immunity One thing point Judiasm religion similar current legal system many ways.

In first hand experience Brooklyn I've seen Chasidic community decimated virus.  Good old natural selection Mini stroke. person needs er asap. seems like lot posts regarding wearing masks not. 

Let's better remember live society, individual freedom based causing others harm inconvenience.

Let us agree common goal eliminating virus, real. Wearing mask public helps that. 

We need ""LAW"" guide us, let us considerate nice other, yes?

There’s joke follows that. It’s horrible say. Indeed, significant nearly enough touch people.

Most people’s measure scope problem going “number funerals feel obligated attend per unit time”.

And 22% bump deaths anywhere near effect majority people. champions... world! Especially Karen's MAGAers refusing wear masks give kids masks really tbh, worse Suceava. used hundred cases (even surpassed 200 point) able 250 tests per day. study done May, estimated 20-25% people live county seat percentage likely higher now. best part is, blame failed handling 2 things, existence Florida, man impersonating president posting hospitals get paid covid patients. inflated case count, well proved earlier sources already, including directly inside hospital itself.

This comment made Brazilian. I’d less concerned screaming 30 second ride goes 60mph 2 hour line. RE: Brian Kemp Dog.

Problem solved. Srsly, dogs improve immune response kids. absolute definition stupid truth generally people days filthy. believed washed 2 times life, birth died America retarded. constitution written slave owners hundreds years ago. even listen shit? proper indoctrinated. Entitlement issue, people get news, especially meltdown (which shows lack mental maturity possibly health). large, people anxious get anxious wearing mask hyperventilate. say someone US city south people wearing masks come walks life, entitled all.

It's easy characterize people neighbors live side world. I'm wearing masks, day long. encourage everyone community beyond wear mask safety kindness. need get mentally get place US normal. Different sites different cutoff times, don’t always line schools told open, think lot places would not. course happened Fort Myers, FL.

The obvious difference, cashier go college beome cashier. cashier take money give change home. nothing stopping online teaching outside pissed parents miss free babysitting getting.  *poo tee weet* wanted acknowledge dry humor seen. wisest choice imo. logistics testing every single student every 3 days would huge mess quite expensive. Even still, unless results came quickly, whole process would waste time.

I'm glad least country's best &amp; brightest students protected exposure school...  Bar low... According certain world leaders, Dont test Cannot haveTHE CoronaVirus... taps forehead I'm actually surprised Trump try add already. trap along. never trust Florida. Florida idea opposite. risk assessment every day, I’m worried myself. don’t know I’m supposed see government basically abandon citizens traumatized that. Even prospect known.... Safer somewhat, yes absolutely, however takes 1 asymptomatic infection begin spread. 

Half-measures going eradicate virus, though slow spread.

 I'm camp shutting everything (with exception grocery stores, hospitals) entire world, mask mandate actually enforced (rigidly, tyrannical fines) 3 weeks. 

If everyone stays home 3 weeks, masks getting groceries time, basically eradicate viral spread. Anyone develops symptoms 3 weeks treated hospital, asymptomatic cases would resolve/become unspreadable time. virus workplace/space would die time.

There obviously cases might slip cracks, would much easier contact trace handful cases globally disaster we're dealing now.

The question is, could every nation actually cooperate make happen alleviate global pandemic? would think not, even attempt would probably enough decimate spread... Right Here, stories coming sound good Herd Immunity  parents even allow thermometer house. hypochondriac parent insists inviting people coughs openly damn place, I'm super paranoid Why? True. napkin math there. I’m hoping vaccine comes soon! Exactly this. building condo complex half-empty right due snowbirds decided stay FL instead coming back NY March.

Why pay system can't something simple? supposed people people, asshole axe grind investment account grow? No, acted 4 months ago. Smh Unfortunately, incorrect. problem is, Arizona hit testing capacity massive (and growing) backlog. See discussion: snatched politician lied, cop abused authority. I'd prefer safety. Safety never exists all. blame car knocking someone blame platform someone uses it.  No. \*hugs\* deserve raise deserve treated way. bet happening country people thinking they’re sick really don’t want go hospital many Covid patients. feel certain numbers undercounted along. 50k more? catch us end August guess I'm surprised. Younger people probably likely close proximity longer period time. ie) bars, pools, etc. Viral load joke. Personally, dont know anyone would hire troublesome middle level mangers, go around firing people little provocation. would make money? get new employee speed. never ran plant, maybe right. Sometimes fire needed clear away underbrush make room new growth.

Destruction breed creation. news networks. problem elites. 

A good example business mask wearing. Back March April, CDC Surgeon-General concerned insufficient masks medial staff. Instead explaining American people, dumb said masks work. consequently, months later, still arguing masks. and?? what's critism truthfulness Beijing?

absolutely nothing, Beijing much full shit US terrible echoes fears farther.My grandfather different country suspected covid right woke fever today severe muscle aches yesterday. coronavirus hotspot fingers crossed okay🙏🏽 Georgia slightly less, population adjusted, like 14% positive rate. 45+ 40% population. small group.

Hot weather Arizona means people go indoors know virus spreads rapidly. entirely likely virus would struggle survive handrail sitting 110 degree temperatures (the handrail going hotter 110). However, help Arizonans indoors outdoor activities. don't. record that? thought Sun kills virus. UV light. least surface. people still carry it. unexpecting carriers sneeze thinking they're allergies spreading sunbathing territory?

It does. evidenced protests outdoor transmission negligible. 

It's activities people engage indoors clearly driving transmission. Gonna end bunch sick dead parents ICUs one take care kids. God help us all. Pretty sure Michigan started reopening despite theatrics. Pulling hit miss.  used condom. rate infection doubled, mean see rate death doubled? simply can't imagine 3000/day death, horrifying..... Highest rates Canada Quebec, ~6800 cases/M ~680 deaths/M. Every province least well half that.

Highest rates northern US NY &amp; New Jersey, ~20000 cases/M (almost 3 times worse ) ~1700 deaths/M (2.5 times worse Quebec).

Both Quebec (with _objectively_ result 2.5 times better New York state) Ontario (with _objectively_ result 7 times better New York state) share heavily travelled borders New York state.

A primary reason Quebec bad spring break early, lots people vacationing American Eastern seaboard.

Last week 7/1 (84k) 7/8 (108k) 30% jump cases; thats 19 days per double rate. 

The absolute number cases observed. (mid-june: 19,000 cases; last week: 24,000 cases). imagine would like Arizona cut rate increase 50%.

I read comments, see comment US rigged hydroxychloroquine study? know that/similar studies conducted countries results? know absolutely quack French doctor claimed 100% cure rate? reading Dr. Raoult:

[He Science Star. Promoted Questionable Cure Oh, forget planes?

Wait, didn’t. Physically moving personnel around piece puzzle. death/disability/burnout/suicides caused working hot spot ICU’s? think nurse gets back 3 months watching people die every day Phoenix going hearty hale go Chicago immediately?

Morale thing. Burnout thing. Humans cogs work indefinite amount time without break without breaking themselves. actually look data masks seem work.

King County, WA 250% mandating masks.

If somebody show place US masks worked I'd like see it.  shame people read past headline article garbage bordering misinformation. shitty way word headline Well yeah looking numbers everyone already susceptible covid died needs imprisoned. guy single handedly responsible suffering lot Brazilians.

Look Gotham Whale, whale watch runs NYC

I used environmental monitoring NYC seen dolphins frequently Rockaway. teeming life now. worldwide Honestly I’d say information factors affect COVID comforting, gives sense you’ll need reduce risk. best thing I've read day gets people talk ICU beds. People come locations, numbers beds get them. people though? Even find nurses hell says take job? live right across street RN asked point blank would go back work this, pretty much laughed me. said tired way nurses treated way COVID, way hell would come back now. Also still PPE shortage? hear is. one party dedicated maximizing corporate profits else half country keeps voting one two hot button social issues. Mickey way become plague rat.

There's time place teaching lesson, pandemic it, chief. Unless feel updraft coming stairs, safer top floor bottom floor. said benefits top floor probably negated go stairs first place, since see traffic concentration exhaled breath without air circulation. Fake news conspiracy theories major problems Facebook social networks contend with. I've seen lot criticism approach cleaning things up, arguing enough. maybe lot easier said done. AI algorithms human moderation without problems (bias, inconsistency, overzealousness, etc). seems ""silver bullet"". Facebook perfect, maybe biggest issue platform, people using it. thought too. soon someone within school tests positive shut everyone quarantine 14 days?That could happen every 14 days school year! I've said before, I'll say again: delete Facebook account. _promise_ miss it. Unless Congress covers state local deficits huge supply unemployed certified teachers. 2 smaller amusement parks near opened recently.. packed everytime drive work.. maybe opened still.  limiting believe allow space social distance classroom.

2. study, compare CDC link above, provides wonderful contrast: first article states studies found person infected wearing mask reduces viral load escaping them, toward people, 96%. doesn’t medical mask - even simple cotton mask effect. first article also explains scientists skeptical masks first, changed later found masks much effective COVID cold influenza. 🤷‍♀️ maybe pray really like can’t attitude. No. wear masks virus travels water droplets. That's airborne definition.

Airborne means dust particles stuff. virus actually survive air. That's bad. I'm expert virus becomes airborne gg. Jokes me, got promoted February right happened manager like sublet proficiency CDC worker, explain Joe Schmoe walking around store without mask detrimental everyone panic causes. Dang..... recently antibody test done also. sure would come back positive extremely sick early March testing negative flu. came back negative. I’ve heard read quite bit tests ineffective illness without developing antibodies it. highly recommend looking it. entirely possible sore throat covid :) That's lot event cancellations gone down. cancel own, eat whole cost. government forces cancel, there's chance recoup cost contract insurance. already way worse places? Hmmm would pee contain virus?

Also dont kink shame. Nope. US teachers paid well, they're given much work responsibilities nearly impossible work hours day technically done (especially true new teachers), many kids poorly behaved. certain US states hard find teaching job (I hear Pennsylvania one?), states low teachers use long-term subs hire people emergency credentials. Favipiravir several years old, passed phase 2/3 tests flu treatment shown results Ebola, there's nothing strange expedited approval coronavirus shows improvements limited trials serious side effects. basing CDC made point saying ESTIMATE, say correct, still missing point. spend weeks ICU go living course included death toll. I'll still put effort try avoid it. I'm kinda surprised, since people rally anyway. know cases go reopen. point need go slower see people cannot do. 
 
Right bars/pubs worst offender (duh) disagree completely. Masks still effective way slowing spread.  Cazzo dici ? simple fact calling miracle total disrespect towards medical personnel worked 20h days sacrificed lives treat theese people. sit wait magical dude fix shit DIED working. ain't miracle, fucking sacrifice. illegal state (TX) teachers strike.. Depends city probably part city. Iittle kids *can be* super spreaders things, seem case virus. Jury high school students. might rather teaching 5 year olds 17 year olds. could run office Crazy. local target someone door counting people checking masks; it’s way months. 

I think must local manager thing there? live high population area though. read article fed threatened withhold funding state open schools? hurt teachers, parents, students, school system short term long term? humane? will, fair amount confidence officials handle appropriately, enough people respond appropriately. read Maus. lot mentality Shoah. People hoarding smallest things attempt waste gram anything. Yea clearly know trump.

/s Outdoors lot advantages. wind dissipates virus high concentration way indoors. Plus, sun inactivates virus. outside sun raises level vitamin immune system functions better. guy ever stop whining? NFL cancels season would easier, run next year's draft planned everyone redshirts, better yet cancel next year's draft, send player wants IMG academy (or equivalent) training scrimmages, two drafts one following year need go church pray practice religion. BUT, bring people physically church, might forget collection plate needs filled.  verifiably false based links damn post itself. forecast link post links 5.6% downturn Sweden. Lazy trolling worst. Two teachers already retired school. Also elementary school hard time finding school bus drivers custodians started. district already said go back teachers wear masks students won’t. also said still recess breaks students stay 6 ft apart. teach third grade. first thought going talk running graves bury bodies... nah-ah, account natural population growth time! Well... isn’t lovely.  going wreak havoc south get another one like Harvey. recent trend violent weather good year storm trackers. Yeah, literally cannot US law... Medical ethics also pretty much rules well... get links this? Lul. examples aren’t even comparable. churches reopen lose tax exempt status, they're trying make look bad. DJT.....It's coming.  fucking course Canada gonna handle better population way smaller US it’s dense. 37 million vs 330 million.... comparing late March/early April's 250k **estimate** today's 80k **estimate** Fauci's 100k **projection**. Good god slow  BREAKING NEWS!

As July 6th, 77.4% people paid rent full partially. compares 2019's number of...

To give data people paying 6th, last year year.

2019

July: 79.7%

2020:

April: 78%

The difference pretty small.

And look paid end month, data is...

That’s satisfied drug 1% potential difference - want percentage impact much greater save every single human life can.

It actually came conclusion Americans likely wear masks.

The problem freaking silent majority country, apparently. try r/Covid19 

Pretty much r/science facts mods egood keeping comments debate free. Although think fake B.S going bad time there. Churches nowadays money.

It’s easier brainwash exploit person. GOP wanting start old school ""bread riots"" country again? Yeah, leave door interact driver though. numbers come article, article's numbers reflect EC website either (for instance, article claims -8.2% France EC website says -10.6%). best guess would EC adjusted forecasts article written, definitely know case. that, remove numbers economics paragraph OP. California I'd try create super Big numbers scare people masking Deaths going cases going up. Deaths going nationally ny New Jersey deaths going new cases.

But see college football prayer happening, even Trump-By-God-And-SEC Country. many players, many coaches, travelling different states time. Yes. None California testing sites last checked. Thanks suggestion tho. frustrated Americans left wonder U.S. can't seem get act together, especially given fair warning virus wreaked havoc China Italy, Spain New York.

“It’s hot mess,” said 47-year-old Jennifer Hudson Tucson, Arizona. “The fact we’re relying companies don’t national response this, it’s ridiculous. … It’s keeping people need tests getting tests.”

It took Hudson five days make appointment CVS pharmacy near home. booked drive-up test weekend, week symptoms — fatigue, shortness breath, headache sore throat — first emerged. clinic informed results would probably delayed. CDC keeps updated regularly (albeit couple weeks lag), current count 160,000 excess deaths expected average. Well done. keep same.

Hopefully least us stay healthy. said damn thing reopening first place. world, “science” comes political public pressure. virus literally everywhere, no. really irks whole mask debacle Trump recommended masks beginning, none shriekers would think twice wearing one store.

Obviously, younger healthier are, less number wpuld particular age/health level.

(2/3 people show symptoms)*(symptomatic fatality rate .4%)=0.26%

Yes. estimate, based best data right now. better data CDC does? go best data given time tweak data comes in? contact tracing does? mean, sure requires cooperation, perhaps biomarkers determine cause/effect individual level (if science could fill blanks). lot data inside blood mRNA.

Independent observation: Mark Zuckerberg biggest source greed west coast country wow turns meanie liberal governments stopping them, VIRUS!! shocker! One 2 things would make anti-mask Americans fear COVID-19:

Twice week I've seen people masks pulled nose yelling wearing mask.

I also constantly see people pull mask neck soon passed store entrance.

Also quite common occurrence, People coughing make get way. ( find one particularly fucked kind stare right face like stupid usually leave ) early April, percentage Americans unable make full on-time housing payment jumped 24

What percentage January, February, March? would nice baseline. percent ""jumped 24"" implies baseline data significantly less 24% reported article. sister sound like person. I’ve never really one deal anxiety pandemic happened. get &amp; give immunocompromised parents I’d devastated. someone helped time anxiety acts up. doesn’t mean get again.  Without antibodies you’re vulnerable someone never it. saying legal recourse killing someone virus. right?

There lot people right walking around knowing virus care zero fucks giving anyone. Oh flu bro. Nm. worth time.  clearly see POV now, attributed masking social distancing opening early. Anything else help with? said many times I’ll say again. 60% Belgian deaths inside nursing homes, hospitals. nearly every country, including US, deaths reported reported all. Making per capita charts quite skewed. worried about? America? like watching slow motion train wreck. 
We’ve 100-200 new daily cases Melbourne last days we’ve got state borders closing. 
I’m sorry stupid question, one anything prevent spread America? borders closing lock-ins enforced like Melbourne? feel like eradication probably pipe dream point, slowing spread going best case scenario.

Shutting everything 3 weeks? You’d vote that, even whole US would probably huge. would even stock 3 weeks supplies lock front door whole time. reasonable think would actually happen? isn’t simulation, millions social variables. 

Testing tracing going key. Testing less 100% accurate delivers margin false negatives? Still extremely worthwhile strategically implemented. Tests “only good day performed”? Also useful tool controlling thing. problem nothing mentality. Fuck you, Trump. also people simply going hospital should, illnesses injuries. updated link? I’d like show them, find one Pinellas County. states got hit hard like New York, basically guaranteed heavy second wave right? Especially lots passion even need job.

My Mom teacher whole life stopped raise brother went back went college even though Dad's income enough. loved teaching done last 10 years.

Tell me, long death count continue track downward give up? skimming paper Brazil long ago also find mix pardo black propensity, socioeconomic factors (poverty health care) usuall expected comorbidities (age, obesity, etc).

In sweden something similar happen, taking toll heavier factors, vitamin seems ""hidden"" factors almost nobody talking enough sunny brazil seems deficient Sweden, swedes fortify think not, puzzling high level many factors, details big disparity countries populations structured. think unemployment numbers manipulated sense yea people going back work many people employed 6 months ago.

That’s irresponsible. issue still stands worse US one major factor: leadership many citizens chosen ignore allow get worse. Italy hit bad, took huge steps toward getting better. literally opposite happening here. worse position based entirely fact like we're gonna hit peak number Italy did, taper off. going keep going live people even unpack register. scan stuff yourself, put bag checkout pay.

Surely, must something bible tells people protect themselves. story that? doubt moment today, even week. Somehow think moment already passed early June. says sacrament. Depends data you’re referring to...

Anyhow, seems disagreement regarding “standards/protocol,” cannot fathom slowly altering guidelines current day. example, cannot seem grasp anyone isn’t tested positive recorded case even though new guidelines clearly state criterion one classified “probable/presumptive” case.

Also, I’m sure said “article” linked? never commented it, stated - simply first written link could find regarding matter. material I’ve directly *referenced* new guidelines issued Texas DHSH. carefully woven media narrative, political bias - raw documentation. GOD DAMN RIGHT! We're going straight hell goddamn handbasket! FUCK YEAH! work retail, job actually given employees ability refuse assist customers aren’t wearing masks, said customers let known door.

So far, there’s 1 customer I’ve tell to, they’ve fairly understanding, Perhaps ask why. Could possibly exposing much virus would social distancing, lockdown measures wearing masks? 

The amount virus particles exposed linked severity illness. Fewer virus particles makes possible immune system contain upper respiratory tract therefore get milder symptoms. virus particles increases risk gets lungs face serious illness long-term issues. mean, crap.

Wasn’t another article posted said 650 cases? seen anyone even say word weeks.

Funny! Awhile back right-wing news hosts posting shit like ""facts fear""... turns maybe facts LEAD fear, among sensible people! way side political party (because sadly pandemic political America) comes terms someone know dies it. 

Although seriously think even say Pence Abbott...one Trump's buddies died it..it change mind normal brain...it would. Hell believe Trump already got sick it...it might actually worse America would say ""See..I beat it..it means bad!!"" base would eat up.

As crazy sounds...I really believe first mistook R mean Russia sincere wave question: Spanish flu waves weren’t measured second peaks area, surge new cases period decline. say wave one spring mid west, wave 2 fall north east, wave 3 early winter west south. said - wouldn’t considered second wave? worried numbers increasing here. parties BBQs nobody wearing masks. school starts going get control people mass transit. Also, teachers traveling bringing bad towns.  I'm kinda surprised online schools k-12 isnt thing yet. many pros/cons, seems like something america would save $$$ think so. would better fucked without throw someone street evict tenants still fucked.

We're gonna see thing lot retail space too.  get along anyone assume issue. that's actually article says but, know, publishers want people read. Great news - countries always turn tide strict lockdown, easing SLOWLY. means they're testing more? course tests good thing. students aren't. sure point is?

Can't get high school can't read... write... add... think OP saying still work little make enough considered employed get benefits PRESIDENT, US hand ASSHAT. one’s calling hoax here.

First, trying think could ever ride roller coaster without screaming. read comment, I'm laughing. Mental image one cartoon caterpillars, circle segment face wearing mask, sitting utter silence repose coaster twists turns, turning upside down. Dead. bullshit put another way, people around world die coronavirus *2\~3 days* worst Ebola outbreak. ...a drunk driver would say his/her behavior. Well two pieces information. One, person replying lives united states, two, person wishes lived Italy (and guess implied: feel US, whole, worse Italy). things could compare US Italy, pointing Italy hit worse US been. say US hit worse, end, know worse Italy things stand. idea person lives, New York Idaho. Seeing places waved white flag eliminating even mitigating COVID, that's right. Brazilian dame feeling Someone shared link earlier today shows data. completely sure data produced (assume cell data) shows Sweden, relatively, pretty little social distancing. US quite bit lower Japan closer Sweden levels less distancing US.

The bottom chart one referring compare Sweden countries. handful less distancing look Sweden may gotten started little earlier countries - know slow response coronavirus US.
First cases Jan, Trump nothing Feb, Finally agreed pandemic mid march..

Testing started slow eventually increased... case numbers great every level testing (even increased) still enough.

If current level back april, things would probably good (if coupled contact tracing, social distancing etc etc)

We know daily cases dropped (well really.. 20,000 daily instead 30,000) trumps decision open.

We know task force didnt really help much since disbanded.

now case numbers increasing... done improve situation?

It bad nothing done feb. Great daily tests got 300,000 per day - postive test rate actually started going down.

How america survive election. trump actually gets elected, Man. think US become russia - superpower one likes. Mexico Canada borders remain closed, Americans wont able go anywhere Europe......

Its scary. record high 191 new coronavirus cases Tuesday prompted Victorian premier, [Daniel reintroduce stage three restrictions across metropolitan Melbourne. 

Compare serious coronavirus treated Melbourne (\~5 million population) ""only"" 191 new cases America, half states people 30+ states saw new cases yesterday... stay waiting testing?  Fake news ""Aw geez thanks!!"" Thanks kind you. Dozens articles. 1 source. Worldometers 55k, covidtracking 52k, cdc 51k. John Hopkins best sources I’ve found. John Hopkins clear outlier data doesn’t match sections website.  gotta stop testing go away ! /s might something see you’re going wrong Yeeeeeehaw let's open early....corona get near us Trump voting church going Republicans Why? noted someone else, ""Americans learn catastrophe, experience"" former president Teddy Roosevelt put it. New York fine now, low numbers; experienced catastrophe like Italy. America? 'its mild flu' whatever garbage say. That's humane can't imagine doctor allowing ordering that. 

My wife retired doctor managed office. person care, keep care. can't park hospital steps wait taxi.

In extreme cases, pre-writen ordered ""living will"" pull plug even huge gut punch doctor. wife dealt LOT cancer cases years want play poker keep straight face anything.

On hand, couple times wife broke tears patient left office. always surprised begin with. New York similar numbers deaths per capita worst region Italy, national deaths per capita approaching Italy's (407 vs 577), believe difference. There's similar unity almost everywhere Europe, far tell.

From outside answer appear quite obvious. president divisive president I've ever seen, dealt threat dismissing manner Bolsonaro Boris. Luckily UK changed strategy quite early, delay still put way past Italy 656 deaths per million.

I bet situation different Trump used charisma speeches make supporters take virus seriously instead constantly downplaying it. Fully understable frustrations justifiable. 


I would get annoyed people unknowingly idiotic. started thinking alot ( probably weed occasional shrooms ), 

The way believe factual evidence science produces, feeling people believe opposite. 


Like find ridiculous people still support leader US. take second realize realities, genuinely feel like they're correct one.

What believe truth, directly shape perspectives perspectives directly shape reality. 


It's trippy metaphysics figure control persepctives, control reality. best way literally reading books. Knowledge power books direct link perspectives people. 

I'm working masters Philosophy kinda shit fascinates me. God must told that, nobody else know sure right now. Hey I'm willing die muh guns muh freedoms. dont need God Savior Trump telling whut do. /s government isn’t “abandoning” anyone, government saying “you want life”. tired one symptoms. test. Fourteen days, it’s length show symptoms  We're stupid ignorant whole right thing. need enforced. understand saying, that's fair point! sad. usually local rules attorney dress various federal districts.

However, attorney wearing said attire hazmat suit suit worn response rational risk.

I think judge even good it.

Clearly court didn’t feel slighted. hope pull through.. Stay strong That's really bad. fine. Life goes confusing case fatality infection fatality. 2 different numbers. they're backtracking. main argument kids seem likely vectors transmission. aggregate may true, outbreaks like YMCA camps Georgia last week belie statistic. much research case studies re-opening schools hot zones double digit positivity rates among populace. ""no immunity"" correct everyone, million people recovered. get shots every 6 months state constantly protected, it. Oh need watch one!   Syphilis bacterial infection. afraid you.  think government wrong basic approach, everything seems suggest could much better outcome par immediate neighbours. valid reason, point view, already relatively social distanced Sweden considerably lower population death rate us Ireland, like Norway, Denmark, Iceland Baltics do. par while, they've overtaken us.

However, population health infrastructure great strengths mitigating this, strengths Ireland extent, many places also not, factors working higher population death rate.

Japan also, IMO relatively disastrous governmental response. individual behaves baseline level (masking flu season, one) strong component, enough prevent one basket cases response this.

The worst case scenario, IMO, country finds rock hard place national level lockdown 2nd time. sustainable way keep going. Many places shown even socially messy country reopen relatively safely (admittedly, we're going short term data, South Korea good exemplar limited mitigation measures face serious outbreaks clusters) shame that. knows, might saved life.  jerk.. fuck gives much hope! Sanitiser store visited day smelled like straight tequila highly highly highly suggest never get information Reddit comments, it’s probably stupidest thing do.

However say go ahead read article points mind. it’s worth promise I’m making valid criticisms. course means nothing end still recommend read article.

As far old account is? Every like make new account. It’s scary easy accidentally share enough personal info someone dox you. That’s internet paranoid Chy-na speak ""Wuhan?"" -Trump probably one NRG convention center think. True work healthcare came back sick decently bad case covid (out 3 weeks) lots staff either sick working weeks day mess much work is, working hours full ppe gets hot suit still shortness breath man people listen hits home. tell many local people area posted parties get together river outings etc FB mask social distancing like everything okay pray get another huge spoke festivities expecting go substantially. Everyday new record deaths. going it? Nothing. Surprised reaction. Interesting.

How data last years compare year? Awesome friend lifelong republican voted Trump 2016 (though don’t think plans year). wife lost job due Covid trying navigate unemployment system sends message unemployment system piece shit really needs fixed. Well fucking shit! It’s like one party defunding years intentionally fucking up. admit understands social safety nets important, took personally experiencing hardship get there. ticking time bomb.. There's difference traditions people actually believe. Italians think Catholics ethnic marker Church attendance rates free fall, number civil marriages outstripped religious ones, divorce abortion legalised since 70s, on. There're lingering beliefs Catholic faith, one saddest widespread homophobia among older generations, Italians religious. Especially North Centre country people live. seems boil nobody wanting take responsibility take action. live KS. Governor said wear masks next month. leave local counties enforce it. 


This absolves type responsibility decision puts effort enforcement lack thereof onto local small towns. wear live people wearing masks - I'm wearing one whenever go work next month.  


How - wear fucking masks next month lets see happens? Fine refuse wear $100 allow public places like grocery stores walmarts?  really extreme try eradicate COVID? Yeah, bar set low enough, anyone rock star. experts advised to, expected vapid mouth piece. right now? Jul 7th, 993 people died US (according worldometers), highest increase since beginning june. Yes. Herd immunity isn’t light switch. additional immune person population makes easier slow spread. There’s hardly person could worse now. shouldn’t forget either. Littles make 2/5 school age population. can’t discount 40% population Hope brother pulls threw Totally see Saul Goodman Oh no, rally Tulsa, Oklahoma. conversation like adult? It’s going happen either.

And two three weeks tops Trump saying always wore mask. Nobody asked People *some* countries done homework look go, ""You see? give time coronavirus go away. need change anything!"" think US become russia - superpower one likes.

Trump Twitter, though. Like right wing ex colleague likes tweet: ""Death rate still low also death rate fake""

Umm wanted teacher too, I'm glad didn't. think I'd've gone postal administrators did. dodged question 

Ok, Japan Vietnam instead Edgy. know churches taxed? avoid giving right make political contributions. tax them, also open huge worms. OH WOW

I know this! religious people stupid oh yeah cause think god going protect them.  cases no. happened last three weeks gathered lot people made scream??? Also would different conversation completely missed opportunity last four months shutdown offered every developed nation planet took advantage of. semi competent administration would low end community spread safely re-opening. . Lol became real end Jan read millions lockdown China. Yup. nutshell.

The US treating virus like Groundhog Phil treats shadow. Right?! Especially since cases viruses (such flu) dramatically decreased That's point. lockdown explanation effect vs much normally socially distanced population much better healthcare infrastructure, otherwise, would likely looking much like Norway Baltics current situation, Ireland, bad situation been, I'm glad compare likes England Lombardy Madrid Belgium.

 yes, own, massive, costs. actually Ireland 2km travel limit. anyone reading skipped high school civics otherwise basic grasp government works: 

Federal legislation supercedes state municipal decision making UNLESS overturned one supreme courts.  

In words, issue competent federal leadership.

Particularly you’re willing real, legal, official test, organization know-how get done. worry, 99% everyone gets fine. Great leader said so! /s reply huh take issue fact someone disputing idea young people getting sick, many hospitalized, based IFR estimate.  fatality rate literally nothing posting about. According CDC, likely 10x cases confirmed (source below). multiply 3.05mm confirmed cases (as today) 10. implies CDC estimates 30.5mm people COVID-19.

According *The Atlantic* COVID Tracking Project (source below) 251,499 COVID hospitalizations date. consistent University Minnesota COVID Hospitalization Tracking Project (source below) states 256,807 hospitalizations date. use higher number. 

256,807 hospitalizations / 30,500,000 cases = 0.84% infected people needing hospitalization. So, would imply 99.16% COVID infections mild. 

CDC estimate total number Atlantic* COVID Tracking COVID Hospitalization Tracking ""Its libs fake news trying spread fear."" terms ""will catch not"" amount time really matter, matters much virus enters body. small enough immune system kills spreads fine. high enough immune system can't stop time, ""caught it"". Limiting amount time spend breathing virus limit total amount virus get, there's enough air, short amount time stop getting sick.  

There's evidence amount virus initial exposure impact severity symptoms though, important thing minimize amount virus every opportunity. Wear mask, avoid places others breathing minimize time spend can't. cult would be? Lol Haven’t daycares open whole time essential workers? so, we’ve already done sort mini proof concept children gathering indoors. instances outbreaks trace? agenda right? anyone know hospitalization rate ICU admission rate % daily cases? like 5% something??? Genuinely curious, would happen moved state unions striking pretty commonplace? Could state license them? K-12 Texas currently school teacher Colorado. new thing cling whole ""death rate"" thing blowing Nice. Herd immunity incoming. Yeah, basically agree. Amazing think night became real us U.S. (which admittedly WAY late), mid-March NBA stopped middle game, four months ago weekend. 120 days, that's it. ""Listen, fact matter is, pretty much every scientific medical report shows whenever reopening ... actually lead increase spread. almost ipso facto ... goal never get COVID-19 transmission zero.” - Governor Abbott

Enjoy! Yep, check dashboard (scroll ways load). see far normal weekly death rate are. extreme circumstance hmmm global pandemic, yes. lack government response ended situation first place! Letting 50 different govenors decide lock down?! course going spread place. needed across board unified lock beginning president pussied let run rampant instead. Administrators going take hit budget cuts. would different? like they're listening Fauci. he's giving undue credibility. Nice would really help contact tracing. Mass point contact tracing best weapon second wave. need nip new cases bud especially since state opened up. Yep, confirm. Worked major university 15 years. win-win university sure. I've noticed thing (also Columbus), tbh. least I've out, rare see someone 50 mask on. hasn't, cause would insanely stupid.

Most restrictions lifted, though. somebody secondary condition forced triaged care. 

there's nothign stop hospital giving diabetic's icu bed somebody else without secondary morbidity factor. actually lot people certifications (if lapsed) left teaching miserable. profession could reformed, imagine lot would consider coming back. situation, get fired. me, choice possible, whatever consequences. hope things work out. confirm. Live Rome. many point many students access internet rely school meals parents resources take care teach kids home. Christianity is, always been, threat survival. shall never know, penguin poopy. 0.4% excludes asymptomatic people. 0.26% includes them.

Yes it’s estimate, won’t know true fatality rate years road.

Why take issue CDC estimate? Aren’t experts? mom lives small town MO city shot mask ordinance yesterday basis ""our hospitals even critical Covid patients"". they've sending critical patients bigger hospitals city. 🤦‍♀️ types stupid debates US struggling hard.. I’m expert, believe advise halt testing. It’s waste money, virus going disappear summer heat extra uv rays zapping away!


major /s! India also ability make Remdesivir Sadly dont think US population attention span/empathy covid get 900k-1million death range. Shitty, thats America 2020. LMAO UNDERSTAND SAYING. irrelevant wrong see? exactly BENEFIT going ICU? payout, lose money. payout, change much money compared healthy. Yeah NOVA good mask wearing, go little outside rural masks seen. That's even taking account VB mentioned. I'm Bergamo, abroad 2 years. family still there, father started getting sick around 10-15 March. started getting worse, called emergency line came check two occasions, kept saying bad enough admitted hospital. parents close cardiologist working Papa Giovanni XXIII asked could do. triage area outside hospital brother drove got accepted, waiting spot open. Miracolously managed admit day after, spent 5 days ""alone"" dozens patients, helmet device help breathe properly basically didnt let sleep noise (he managed send mom couple updates phone). 23rd got admitted intensive care got worse, 25th called mother 5am tell wouldnt lasr much longer. Somehow cardiologist friend made possible go see one last time, thats way basically families got. many people died alone there, cant help feel much collective sadness every time think it.

I wish people countries would stop stubborn hateful help this. media pays way much attention loud minority. 30 dipshits show city hall protest masks people throw tantrums stores demand wear masks media freak suddenly everyone thinks means whole country refuses wear mask. RO, small thing compared people going thru. Canadian thought I'd clarify, Like zee zed. tend stay strong. Anyhow, hope best you. Social distance, masks, wash hands, aware surroundings, stay home. Works us. Take care. UK actually flattend curve would lump group... bad start since Boris got taking bit serious.

&amp;#x200B;

In Brazil still flu, even president giving ""positive"" interviews without mask. lest drug lords realize serious.

India indeed catching badly insane amount people virus spreading indeed bad, US wont long term chance secure lead look raw cases

&amp;#x200B;

But right US still world leader Cornell's paper assumes cases students infecting community members people infecting university members. model assumed happen. studies exercises wishful thinking. realize staying safe alive losing. know trying balance extremely political issue throughout storied career really political now, starting ""This asteroid looks really bad, *maybe* build ship stop it, *maybe* not, *maybe* wear helmets there's enough professionals"" make great protagonist.

I fully believe means best, goddamn shitty environment work administration. States enforce law dictate. 

I mean even go restaurants Uber drivers.  time people look mask around neck best case it’s around mouth.  I’ve yet see 2/4 workers 4 separate fast food restaurants I’ve actually wear mask. pull past nose. 

And took 6 Uber rides suddenly first time 4 months. Despite Uber telling roll window down. Every single one windows sealed shut.  

If states want require (which support) enforce it. great money maker budgets getting slashed. Houston going get raped, social distancing, resturants full. think there's live apps using Apple Google's framework yet. US jump board instead leaving small handful states fumble it. 

The way works maintaining anonymity quite brilliant! people know anything assume government tracking app true. framework specifically designed make tracking impossible. I've waiting whole liFe literally almost double confirmed cases entire state since pandemic began... Native American Casino (I hope I'm responding joke) Also pressure placed hospitals right now. every hospital maxed out, n people admitted hence die. 

This ticking time bomb almost ready explode big time even need said? That’s 100% true. absolute tragedy though None said makes sense.

ETA: don’t even understand difference bacteria (Syphillis) virus (small pox). mom already planning retire soon, I'm pretty sure lack concern teacher student health final straw decision year. They'll probably say still holiday weekend. They're going keep milking garbage excuse while. people without worrying logistics punishing people Hmm. Might talking Saint Pierre Miquelon. say anything Joe Blow street?

My point teacher physically present students lot options available teachers students. article says they're generally testing at-home deaths. test minority them. hope ramp testing everybody. Welcome year butt sitting.    excess death numbers look like? might directly comparable.  Never traveled anywhere outside city/state born Wuhan: welcome party! Holy smokes. That's almost 1% entire population 😬😬 insane!  Like threatening take funding schools unable reopen due CDC guidelines? forcing CDC change guidelines used count unsafe totally safe? every sports stadium, club, concert hall, gym, dance studio, camp, festival, school, bar, airport etc.. industries support those. pilots flight attendants going air traffic remains levels. One year ago 2.5 million passengers July 7th, year 640k July 7th. I'm outsider looking in, seems government's plan make citizens turn spreading disease/destroying economy take heat themselves. I'm Bergamo. know feel right now, fear. Please stay safe, wear masks, wash hands stay home much can. Hope get better soon too. Americans don’t wear mask makes news days. Emiratis don’t hate leadership absolutely love Want Baron attend regular public school without special freaking treatment. 

Hate demigods. doubting you, source? well, seen debates, lots mommies believes ""children get sick"" worry face masks spoiling pictures possibility catching covid. Welcome long term Zoom hell kids! understand you’re coming using EU reason people worked toward common goal.... Bergamo, Italy... doesn’t make sense. Btw, miracle doesn’t related religion all. Slow n steady wins race! Millions people got it. sound like STD.

It made marks like smallpox. Syphilis called great pox. Smallpox airborne. 

So may well airborne time. 

It went disease killed people within months disease took years, even decades, kill.

Diseases change time, dude. Best remember that. There's shortage homes market coupled low interest rates type people buying homes really seen livelihoods impacted much pandemic. 

The houses near selling within week two asking price bidding wars, insane idea exposed bugs weakens immune system urban myth. absence exposure opposite actually happens, immune system become strong, over-reactive small things leading allergies developing. takes literally years non-exposure, months home make difference, especially pet. plenty democrats advising people go eat restaurants (including Pelosi, Philly mayor Kenney, DeBlasio) February. amount stupid back February bipartisan. even matter much accurate is, within reason. effectively find cases HUGE scale quarantine them, even get 95% accuracy whatever, quickly kill pandemic. need tests we're doing, importantly need quick results. 48 hour response basically useless pandemic suppression, since 48 hours likely peak transmission time. Safer what?

I think drive would hazardous you. stay arms length long person handing food coughing window direction fine. Ok go get easy read coronavirus number updates. 

I love worldometer layout. Super easy read see state numbers seems like lately completing daily numbers moving next day. 

John Hopkins 1point3acres format confusing see state state breakdown totals one. Instead click multiple states see it. 

Would love reliable concise website reported total numbers state consistently displayed current 7 day average percent positive tests. dropping masks sky 24/7 No, others, skimmed much. lot people blame. sentiment helpful. point fingers want kinds experts, officials, leaders, sitting around putting burn book. changing country's situation unfortunately.

More importantly, take responsibility actions educate others help mitigate spread collective spheres influence. misconception lockdown harder USA’s. Put countries apple’s mobility data search engine here: 

You kidding me? Dude, mobility persons Denmark installed app, mobility Danish people. totally insufficient, irrelevant. know people using app? know many persons met, many persons touch, cough at? know foot car bus?             
He's talking lockdown measures Denmark. Testing, stay home order, stores schools closed... acted earlier Denmark state USA. Lol yup friend living saudí Arabia haven’t closed anything there, even night clubs want go back able find hand sanitizer gel part straight liquid. Thanks. author report op posted chimed thread, asked check guy's comment offer perspective, wondering they're looking data what.

Edit: [It's different data, according report's  guaranteed easy field used fairly new field, still reliable look around. elderly, young, child. Sounds like perfect age. US worse per capita *have covid point Yep. nasty respitory thing around December (as I'm sure many places did)

But many convinced Covid.... December... nowhere, Iowa. Seems unlikely. productive cough lasting 3-4 weeks. Basically actual Covid symptoms. guess easier pretend already it. many drugs medical properties scheduled. saying weed shouldn’t legal argument makes sense considering drug isn’t schedule medical properties   That's concern been. Even states taking rational approach restrictions US, seem entirely unwilling impose restrictions they're putting bars gyms theaters churches. difference bars gyms churches churches observe religious services. like even liberal states want cross Rubicon. ripple effect communities otherwise track decent handle controlling spread virus. see placebo mask makes feel confident, encourage keep wearing able go productive. 

For every person see wearing mask might actually help see 20 wearing damn bandana mask made underwear material. point accepted masks see people gives confidence go out, really placebo effect. mask magical barrier protection, point like sure. wearing one makes feel better means serve product. DT wants kids back school. going next partisan thing, republicans best make sure kids school. e tested 40 million people. doing, show cases, 99 percent totally harmless. Results country show, country testing — terms numbers terms quality.”
— President Trump, remarks White House, July 4, 2020
This one presidential statements even Trump’s aides trouble explaining.
“The president isn’t downplaying severity virus,” White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany told reporters July 6 questioned statistic. “What president noting that, height pandemic, 2,500 deaths per day. place where, July Fourth, 254; that’s tenfold decrease mortality.”
“When start look stats look numbers have, amount testing have, vast majority people safe this,” White House Chief Staff Mark Meadows told “Fox Friends” July 6. “When look deaths have, you’re 80 years age three, call co-morbidities — diabetes, hypertension, heart issues — need very, careful. Outside that, risks extremely low president’s right that, facts statistics back us there.”


Neither answers actually explain president came 99 percent. That’s math doesn’t work. It’s inexact science, here’s kno  whole developmental category Russia is.

At least seem regarding hospitals, could describe Russia's situation chaos. Religion, biggest cult world. vocal minority often suffered extreme abuse

Do source claim? major sport. I'd say ranks 5th behind boxing incompetence, design. knock two birds one stone: kill lot poor people (reducing strain fed budget account projected exponential growth Medicaid social security) get use reason tamper elections November.

This Reichstag fire happening right eyes. De santis long gonna keep ignoring numbers,deaths,suffering people?

Useless. science, words specific meaning. example- medical report (that's doctor fills go visits). 

You keep using words correlation causation, I'm sure know mean: that's people correcting you. science, 'correlation' suggests statistical analysis, specifically correlation analysis (which similar confused regression analysis). mention r-value, correlation analysis. 

r-value, often called strength association, one 9 criterion causality (collective known Bradford Hill criteria). establish causality, need demonstrate factors biological gradient, coherence, temporality. true meaning 'correlation imply causation.' Since then, become horribly overused phrase (as per first comment). Read interesting theory reason flu seasonal disappears summer because, vaccinations infections, takes long reach magic 80% herd immunity number. One local churches drive services folks sit cars stay separate.  I'm happy man consequences asshole. stay inside forever never die!

Immortality discovered boys! Thank info! thought intricacies Nordic party cruises while. ;) I've always *heard* Finns starting fights too, seen data it. wonder perception matches reality? Right, that's exactly can't it. kids trying constantly get school vandalize, bird skunk issue. need taken care school start birds made nests outside almost every door brick corners starting dive bomb employees. I'm going second year respiratory therapy, government promising pandemic pay live. People know healthcare already yet receive cares money. many people Covid19 they're diagnosed. count people, death rate use 1%, whether like not. others refuse show work instead choosing take year off. two huge decrease teachers leading crisis. feel diehard wearing masks reread whole Egypt story see ultimately took Pharaoh’s mind (even brief moment) change slavery Israelites. Everyone story went plagues big one (Angel Death) snuffed firstborn every family unless blood lamb put door (the old Passover story). Pharaoh distraught finally gave let Israelites go.

I hope doesn’t take death family people start wearing masks simply take whole thing seriously, looks like might to. World leaders got seems like might changed Boris Johnson little. I’m sure said Bolsanaro based fight virus be. Trump ever gets someone really close him, maybe he’ll change heart, too, especially ever see go ICU. gets away barely unscathed treats like flu, doubt he’ll ever change towards masks supporters simply think experience virus same. Yeah aren’t people shopping online? It’s free pickup. items you’ve bought saved. asks want almond milk end might forgot. dragging kids around shops. worrying card working. standing line. I’m never going back.. Talk reversal norm. rules staying behind?  Removing class friend group tough decision well. Stinks way look Also, ""herd immunity strategy"" something attributed Sweden foreign media, never goal.

i mean government would ever explicitly endorse actually know this.

In order know this, we'd study asymptomatic cases doing.

We emerging research says otherwise. I'm sure link ready showing region Västra Götaland promised antibody tests place earlier? agree time went on, evidence going outside safer. 

There's still problem traveling outside, need stuff like food traveling, even without that, restrooms far home. fashion statement, political statement. Correct I’m wrong even sure herd immunity achievable virus? leader. jesus christ Smart move. Americans don’t wear masks country, makes think they’d somewhere else? surprisingly, reply question. [Minorities disproportionally killed COVID Alabama thing. US *already* one death per 2500 people. many cases number going change rapidly. Churches. Spreading mental physical viruses 2000 years. see rabble also. don’t think matter, though. Businesses want get back open remove restrictions, don’t want liability workplace infections, want reduce risk closing again.

So, workplaces require employees vaccinated order come work. Conspiracy theories political rage won’t stand “get shot unemployed.” outside mask WAY WAY less risky inside without mask 

thats saying They're always old assholes.

Like go outside anyway. said sick February. 

So like everyone sick anything small cough full blown pneumonia Oct March thinks it. ^^^THIS. want source on? provide problem. cannot believe, president United States, lying citizens pandemic. 

Lots cases leaving folks crippled, breath, pain. Saying 99 percent cases harmless downright lie. Nothing norm though. Agreed. isn’t news anyone who’s actually paid attention. Unfortunately number people *have* paid attention lot smaller number haven’t. They're keeping close eye development Norrbotten quite explosive late (though calmed recently). Finland offered help ran hospital capacity region fact (which looks like needed). 

But risk ""minuscule"" seeing many infections Finland traced back Swedish origin, including first Lapland since April 10th. Americans win everything including pandemics. Arizona bonus stage world ends America. Like mad max Yep. know masks hid identity. masks required, theyre pissy. lot people forced decline option go work cannot stay home elementary aged children. government must provide aid unwilling so. Well average citizen absolutely reopen classrooms, might want take note Japanese. there, it’s teachers change rooms every period, students. even that’s panacea. places close schools matter weeks virulent is. We’re fucked. Happens us! mean you’re gonna mock someone better make sure you’re fucking perfect hindu though comment ridiculous joke. Stop context reason. scene day tomorrow really playing out? colossal waste resources. Yes, need it, PPE ends trash hours. im trying survive week.....shit one thing worries slow they've constructing surge capacity. NY hospitals field hospitals already set early part outbreak, permanent structures, tents.

Tents great idea time year Texas. get vicious thunderstorms we're getting busiest time looks like active hurricane season.

The less rush facilities, better they'll care. That's big reason NYC facilities set end using. actually physically retrofitted ease care needed. reset quickly needed waves even emergency situations. viewed ""waste"" actually really important factor needed Texas looks like they're reaching point already. Id suggest open fire doors entering building create wind tunnel cycles air give going in. Maybe creating air flow help.  


Also might get everything school stolen let raccoon in. Even peer reviewed Chinese studies admitted originated China. trial etc necessary. need enough pissed countries board you’ve got sanctions. Wow good one really got Nah... AstraZeneca says basically make billions doses within months. think US Europe could even vacccinated one month mass production.

The Contagion movie got wrong. easy scale vaccine production billions doses. Agreed. need rounded up. they’re armed free dumb types, drone strike houses send message. really surprise anyone? Opiates lower breathing frequency, that's definitely want people trouble breathing. way I'd vaccine every quarter. even get flu shot. Locking people home months summer borderline criminal. - think filing ""attempted"" murder charges would help willing wear masks [archive link anyone trouble accessing article ](http://archive.is/NwOCk) NBA’s mistake restarting Florida. read eloquently put explanation above? crystal clear.

Uh, no, person even understand varicella virus life get chicken pox. immune - literally still infected. Yeah fuck sticks can't figure condoms matter. people mild illness able recover people mild symptoms get better implement controls? 

Don’t get wrong, believe things need carefully reopen ... adequate precautions protocols. US seems falling ... implementing reasonable protocols prohibit virus spread. Thanks that. Nailed it. happening real thing people dieing manipulated. 100% right anecdote knowing anyone hospitalized means absolutely nothing shapes feel area never locked like new york was. believe numbers tests bad debating that. still know ANYTHING covid possible can't even tell airborne unless withholding info agian keep us scared. lied ware mask ware mask. locking fatten curve..... Nope vaccine..... Nope whenever say definable metrics. scary people trust government much take every opportunity fuck us. way science denier distrustful government anyone be. anything public bad idea apparently - especially indoors.... normal practice sub Reddit general follow course issue new developments happen. brand new article, within last days, new information. 

With restrictions suggesting, we'd hear issue get updates perspectives it. clearly ridiculous suggestion. Absolutely! According study, viruses stayed air 16 hours experimenters using machine kept suspended air. study found viruses still infectious 16 hours. real question long virus stay air own. previous research shows droplets fall ground seconds. droplets aerosolized, stay airborne longer, long, infectious diffuse? study risky zero-gravity wind-tunnel conditions, really isn’t concern us. Probably case places. Would interesting see article talking problem whole vaping considered safer alternative? Amy Cooper incident, I'm left scratching head...why behave despicably *while someone filming you*?

I going say store employees ask wear mask, seems frankly unsafe given attacks we've heard about. messed world live in. classic response now.

“Hey wrong, turns deaths going up. Would’ve nice take action beforehand huh”

“You’re rooting get worse!1!!1”


No, us realistic recognizing blind optimism isn’t viable method fight pandemic. opening cases continued go upwards recipe disaster. works pro-business think tank wants open economy therefore vested interest making virus seem widespread (and thus, less dangerous) is. Oh, *meek!* said *meek!* Oh, that's nice. I'm glad get something, hell time.  ""Sadly, people—many sincere Christians—are terrified forced take mark beast (no, it’s Bill Gates) near future. *Could vaccine? computer chip? get tricked taking it?*

Whatever current issue may (vaccines, SSN, chip implants, SIM cards, etc), need careful confusing personal and/or political convictions meaning biblical text.

To take things account allows much-needed moratorium pointless anxiety fear-mongering. Let’s make Christ focus, endless speculations that, end day, little message Revelation.""

extraneous quotes removed Unfortunately think nationally worse end Summer particularly Fall US. states experiencing significant outbreaks Spring there's significantly less enough stop it, politically among populace. reread article see understand. worth noting LA county reporting holiday may backlog Nah. drive parking lot church meeting, weeks ago.

They screeched PA system virus, begged money 'in hard times', people cars started driving circles throwing cash giant bowl. 

I've never fucking disgusted life. works virus beer. Sure, that’s surgeons 8-12+ hour surgeries wearing masks entire time collapse die mid-surgery need bring switch hitters. . /s know carve dapper swan apple turn bong.

Well people don’t seem afraid 5 million year killed smoking related illnesses. talking significantly high survival rate COVID Given context ongoing pandemic, safe assume doctor talking risk infection. 

Also article: 

#those risk mixed sick people waiting rooms.

Also [the article linked becomes crystal get stressed 80-year-olds sit waiting room young people come prove covid. also find many patients careful used be, ”she pandemic, were, among things, tents patients assessed outside emergency room. significantly fewer people seek covid symptoms, reasonable staff, says Katrin Hruska. Mälar Hospital, patients respiratory symptoms isolated rooms, efforts made reduce risk try keep apart move chairs apart distance waiting room, can't maintain many patients. even patients care much come something call health care center before. also seen people, example, seek stomach ache, also cough on. 

So go. question referring to. referring increased risk COVID infection. clear even SVT article, additional quotes remove question. 2. afford. reason afford go Mexico spend $25 instead $350. literally alternative me. 

Shit mate someone asthma since 2 year old always shocks American healthcare. put repeat prescription chemist, go back couple days later get free inhaler. Anyone thinks experience system fool. System broken pandemic hopefully shines light that, unfortunately think going to. Stay safe! Outdoor conduct experiment, researchers sprayed viral aerosols slowly churning aerosol chamber suspended 16 hours, continuously monitoring changes taking place.

Outdoors safer. necessarily fine, safer. [Has lower risk Retarded is. Maybe actually look data. Also consider reported cases lag actual day infection two weeks. Actual deaths lag another two weeks. reported deaths lag actual deaths one two weeks. I'm apologist recognize things bad getting worse. type reporting actually informative. rolling average much informative, easy produce, reason still focused major headlines. 

The rolling average going well, btw, noisy day day reporting lot local variation due delay/catch reporting. going broken daily on. Agreed bottom line is, fact teachers forced rock hard place scenario horrible. pictures/videos protests, 40%-50% people wearing masks. That's ridiculous affirmation.

I don’t know protest pictures cherry picking argue half less protesters masked, Ive several protests San Jose mask use near universal. people packed like sardines, make magically immune Covid 19 outside. I'm sorry media convinced otherwise.

If moon made green cheese, billionaire.

Again, I’ve protests, weren’t packed like sardines. 

Take second think room 30 people, small church single room. One person breathing filling air virus.

Now imagine 30 people field. 

Can see difference volume I'm guessing churches packing people like sardines every week parking lots give sermons, would OK that? 

Regardless personal bias persecution complex, answer yes less. know know leftists would lose minds?

The way “know” things want believe I’m devoid reason main point is: 4) could 30 million cases NY times concentrating 650. Why?

I guess aren’t aware, read article could find churches sued order reopen, scientists think churches high risk activity, thus cases tied reopening churches demonstrate riskiness.

Also, many scientists media thought BLM protests cause researched issue.

Maybe read article comment.

1. Would like late flu season – much better normal looking child mortality?
2. Would ther fewer deaths care homes virtue stuffing full infected people hospitals?
3. Would ther fewer deaths ventilator aggressive drug treatment?

Narcissistic, agree course inevitable.  would think satire truly died 2020. Republicans follow Trump every word says. like democrats didn’t hang every word Obama said. 

With said... many Republicans want vaccine. also anti-vaxxer types (who part parties) refuse vaccine. Cough cough California Texas. 

To honest, simplification average person relate party’s politics leading politicizing pandemic. like liberals California aren’t anti-vaccine brain dead hippie wannabes every Republican isn’t anti-science pandemic denier mask hating conspiracy theorist. 

So answer question... Texas lot Republicans seeing high support vaccine (even numbers skyrocketing). term “outdoors” shouldn’t universal catch-all, no?

I see quite restaurants “abusing” permit allow outdoor dining using tents completely enclosed flaps. really different indoor dining? Pretty dumb line thinking... considering masks mostly prevent giving others. stupidity selfishness causes others around able pass line? really sound like Darwinism me. nightmare year Yep, times comes over. 

But going dinner kinda different matter know. Hi, again! sure remember I’m also narcoleptic, replied one comments couple weeks ago.

You may find interesting look nicotine therapy aren’t aware already. Supposedly nicotine excites synapses orexin kind acts stand-in. Personally I’ve using one nicotine patch daily last 7 years it’s closest thing imagine remission. mean it’s truly night day. still symptoms, particularly sleep inertia, never take naps anymore 8-9 hours enough sleep alert. Forgot: fire ak47’s air, drunk pbr Got it, thank sharing experience! Let's see DeSantis reacts that. What's gonna mobilize National Guard open schools? don’t forget sing drink cool aide /s Kinda, tested hospitalization, big spike primary care started wide testing. since people sick weeks caught huge lag infected. we're back actual new infections. Geez Concerns virus pretty much non-issue here. Restaurants businesses operating normally, frankly many people wear masks outside public transportations, especially outside Taipei. gym earlier today, packed people without masks. 

That said, marketing ploy downright pathetic. podcast? Sounds interesting me. Ja Rule think? Gods plan Canada: done already ours. 🎶🎵🎵
The Florida Man (the Florida Man)
Oh, Florida Man (the Florida Man can)
The Florida Man went down, up. “Stay safe”

I’ll continue live life. want live fear go right ahead. joke. spelled “yesterday” wrong. ""Unique"" indeed No. Actually doctor said people go emergency care without emergency conditions consult Hruska, however, mean refrain seeking care - right.  patient, try contact health care center call 1177. satisfied care receive, important contact first instance talk unhappy rather seeking care new place, says.

&amp;#x200B;

I think need make mind exactly think healthcare do. one article complain people delayed care afraid go hospitals, another complaining people going hospitals pre-pandemic time again. starting think disappointed life Sweden collapsing entirely. anything know significance saying red shirt: ""Running world since 1776""?
(does tell us anything political leanings?) Especially hospitals run ventilators. totally new perspective/update one nurse. plant living ? absolutely terrifying living Arizona right now, family members high risk. infuriating. 

I think spread rumors mild cases cause permanent erectile dysfunction men, lifelong cystic acne women.

Suddenly, like magic, masks social distancing political issue. Korea traced huge number cases back churches. See: Detroit test positivity rate hospitalizations increasing increase positive cases solely due increased testing, follow increase deaths. 

We've half year learn this, rocket science. idk seems like legit needs help. money like people indulge delusions. Yup, it’s kind like US target military attack federal administration adopted policy letting state address state national guard saw fit, telling procure weaponry ammo, seizing shipments ammo police agencies reselling states hand picked “free market” broker/supporters, attacking complain response invasion Sooners suggesting would better economy let foreign army sweep country take spoils war wish. Well cyanide organic fine! 

/s Everyone loves shit Cuomo realize he’s handled million times better actual President. realize you’re people, right? Shut big nose. little news 985 deaths yesterday US. I’m still seeing articles cases high deaths low.... I’m plumber clearly see surge deaths developing.

I think becoming numb deaths suffering around us 24/7. years. answer question years i'm torn whether would help hurt situation. one person infects goes straight quarantine without infecting community, coworkers, family there's x% chance he'll go hospital. whereas catches covid ""in wild"" there's good chance infecting others superspreader (depending live).

if could choose catch covid way, 2 weeks wife never worry bringing covid home work one day we'd probably take deal major source coronavirus cases BLM protests. get blame white men one. could use US, supplies running short christian, stupid. God give us brain idiots go ""jesus take wheel"" related actions. 

Church building. community. truely believe eyes god Online services good in-building services especially promots health safety fellow humans.

The mark devil something saves countless lives allows us restore way life. believe come form allegiance sign support person. government. idea. single person. don’t want jinx it, really feels like NWSL successful restart. many reasons people's reactions smoking related illness, none related harmful message spreading here. Yup, 6 weeks later. Doomed stoopids. small businesses! Ever notice talk businesses, people risk lives re-opening? article says trench mostly stop car traffic. don’t want discuss staff ambulances! churches major source corona cases riots. Liberal dumb fucks. didn’t go church cause knew would happen, tried warn them. one listened, dad grandparents. course quite people too. fiancée clean. guess there’s win? brings people church revenue generating. clear understand Dynamics infections disease transmission. effective R stays 1.0 virus go extinct. That's happened SARS, vaccine needed. It'll take bit discipline could right month people selfish impatient. feels wrong doesn’t it? Small kids aren’t spreading it? immune transmit Covid? Source please? Good lord, making post definitions. No, that's Karen is, might want figure words mean start using describe behavior like.

***Karen*** *is a* *pejorative* *term used US English-speaking countries woman perceived be* *entitled* *or demanding beyond scope considered appropriate necessary. common stereotype racist* *white* *woman uses her* *privilege* *to demand way expense others.

From Covid Tracking project - Hospitalizations starting climb...and that's without Florida reporting stats. Here's speaking Florida: 
**More 40 Florida hospitals multiple counties across state maxed ICU capacity close running intensive care beds, according state’s Agency Health Care Administration.**  
 things spread like virus you’d think would help understand shit works. basically they’re arguing it’s fair treat bars differently restaurants. nephew got diagnosed past weekend. Everyone super happy he's well seemed forget potential life long problem. husband's father hospice care related Covid-19 bring that's last thing needs worry about. They're field moving goalposts. They're still shitbags. it'll depend much try charge us vaccines spite massive amounts public money. they’ll spread 30 people god knows happens them. see whole article. can't, get online Swedish library. Ametica lacks proper social welfare system free public healthcare all. two things meant European citizens could shelter effectively rush reopen Hmm Az death rate increasing. COVID deniers saying “well even though cases hospitalizations up, least death rate low”. 

I'm still seeing talking point, takes adjust new situation. retailers enforce mask policies anyways. start enforcing country wide. right reject anyone wearing mask matter state government says. airborne. doesn’t matter much spray tables sanitize hands. literally hangs air waiting infect you. walk someone’s cough cloud minute later without mask could get it. Lock “It’s hospitals” told yesterday board. Still lots room fiddle Rome burns. Positive rate increasing, key.. Remember people, God takes care first! Right? Lol sort quintessential example misusing Karen meme point. random middle-aged white woman. I’m religious same. grandpa died decided service church body (idk it’s called) family decided would much risk us all. funeral pandemic 10000% over. easy designing family putting us risk. I’m glad family least common sense. Churches anywhere lot people much risk in. giant family risky us together. Sorry rambling. Replace churches Bars, Restaurants, Gyms still makes perfect sense. Already late... Still it’s happening since it’s concern. happen. yet. 


“Innan coronaviruset slog till toppades sjukvårdsnyheterna av larm från akutvården. Överbelastning ansågs höra till normaliteten.”

It chaos pandemic. during. Chaos normal. wish way make volunteer tribute. Oh cool, dont care 1% dies? Thank volunteering person keep someone sense safe. husband live Arizona. stopped going public March. groceries either delivered home order pick up.....about 3 weeks.....in June, started go local Sprouts early hours nobody there.....NOBODY wearing masks....

My husband went camping July 4th....drove Colorado....only stopped gas.....didn't get pop, munchies, etc like normally do.....NOBODY hardly wearing masks (except Navajo reservation)...and Durango, I'd say 50%.....people EVERYWHERE!!!! drove through...went right San Juans never saw soul.....

Arizona many cases like virus here.....everybody congregating, drinking bars.....and hardly ANYONE wearing masks...and live retirement area: Gold Canyon good news rising *proportionally* increase cases. fact, deaths substantially less percentage vs. percentage increase cases. 

Let's hope continues. Hopefully recent uptick cases convince people wear masks take seriously hospitals get relief. Awe that’s data produce. 👍. Right on!  can't afford mom, keep closed. Wish sister would have. considered assault. average frontline isn’t going force customers wear masks. They’re cashiers police officers. attack pattern targeted harssment engaged months. also literally nothing comment issue hand least topic. Without testing people can’t breathe without 100% plus oxygen environments still get ventilators. 

This sentence makes sense. That's way I'm saying.

It's insanely tiresome seeing doomsday prophets here.

It's possible take whole thing serious still enjoy eating supporting local businesses. safety bubble one hardest hit states country. Yeah okay... baseline capacity. units converted ICU beds, although it’s optimal. nurse work nurse tech post lot election year influenza, disappear November, politically media generated control population, etc. broadcast fact leave avoid exposure due high-risk. also advocate bars restaurants close indoor venues move outside. fewer people inside churches, people tend spread out. Also churches likely filled vulnerable people bars restaurants.

But agree. gotta follow money considering owners establishments, including churches, do. NFL room delay start unlike rest leagues private schools religious, therefore pay taxes? entitled relief funds? Harm reduction thing. It’s needle exchange programs seatbelts. 

People aren’t going stay home. safer outdoor activities help curb spread people going congregate ANYWAY

See caps 😬 yeah wearing mask stupid helping spread virus, simple fuck? Better keep listening, might say bit blessed big noses... Americans stupid take reasonable precautions leaders completely failed. It’s going take people dying streets, mass graves, etc...before morons country even begin consider taking seriously. crazy seems, beginning. Wait till school starts gets cold out...winter break US completely. 

Our hope point vaccine. Forgot /s! might catch it.. well least making joke about. joke right? Hard tell serious actual people talk like see nothing wrong. Lol CA, Bay Area. Appointments booked solid city. like CEO saying ""if we're right, we're right. we're not, relatively small inconvenience."" summed nicely uncommon belief, US presidents last half century accused someone another planning institute mark real thing we're talking choice puts teachers administrators risk. churches. Mine 100% remote since March. Zoom Sundays venmo tithing. Technically, we're allowed reopen 25% occupancy (I'm NY) done yet. Truthfully, we're sure we'll reopen. Fauci like guy asteroid movie keeps saying “this asteroid looks really bad maybe build spaceship stop it” two hours, heroes worry stock market. vaccine effective, frankly care people choose remain unprotected. vaccine works, is.  use whatever sway fight less valuable bosses. Oh don’t get started. boss told implementing nation wide mask rule martial law. Ma’am people fucking dying. I’m glad live area “if you’re public you’re wearing mask” rule. everyone follows least people do. problem lot low income folks school childcare. can’t afford daycare day stay home likely don’t anyone watch kid doesn’t work. poor don’t cush office jobs home. 

What seeing huge class issue. People battling lot choices including able feed house families. people need schools open able work.

Its middle class thing look school children purely education opportunity. poor also built childcare system free. agree everyone keeps saying like Italy human squirrels possums. mean creature dies due lack awareness surroundings. OK this? guys, don’t get . needs buy another $40million yacht. look Daily New Deaths United Kingdom graph? 

The one deaths peaked April rapidly declined since then? 

The death curve pretty much every country world now? wish, kill zombies stop infecting others.... That's problem organizations IMO. taking people dangerous, selfish, confrontational views (it's already bad enough wear mask, go store cause shouting matches / tantrums refuses wear one), letting preach messed worldview entire group weekly (if often). causes degradation entire organization Ferrell would star doubt. 2016 2020 make Campaign look like documentary fuck know infection rate .00092% break age? people sub saying ""the death rate spike"" since may

*It's joke bro!* Well, mean, get saying Austin, going snow ground. anything might black ice. That's Wuhan ""quarantine hospitals"" people tested positive symptoms. One person household gets sick get sick move one person rest family stays healthy.  You’ve breathing people people breathing without masks entire life. Besides, it’s like virus set early 2020 appointment get US whatever country you’re in. started reporting China back October last year, chances worldwide late November/early December. anybody wearing mask back then? No.

In words, there’s good chance you’ve already caught virus. probably good number people know. Stop paranoid. can’t believe news lately. Anyone grasp virus able recognize based contagious virus studies come airborne since February/March. understand people didn’t call saying it’s airborne opposed emphasizing mode transmission via droplets. Airborne powerful incentive take things seriously may helped people cautious opposed bullshit 6 feet rule doesn’t shit, particularly without masks. want amend constitution allow government able forcibly detain citizens pleasure?

I see trade freedom. 

China seems breeding ground new diseases, case government actively covered allowed spread outside borders ""came clean"". Controlling allowed get away it.

Once virus free world little stop it, aimed slow it... know remember initially mantra ""flatten curve"". Well hospitals even close max capacity, far succeeded original goal. goal post moved since then, meeting new goals. may lethal easy made be. recovery take months even young healthy adults leave life long damage Setting aside mortality rate, severity illness could teachers (and students) sick WEEKS. fed opinions too. insurance company don’t really care (Their values). don’t want risk losing business incident. grandparents, make decision quit volunteering coming year. grandchildren's father transplant taking immune suppression drugs.

We actually know this. point would assume they're testing both

The developed Asian nations testing capacity both. 
The first confirmed case U.S. Jan 21.


So trade open? North Koreans leaving coming back? Jan 22 probably several weeks late. misleading. concerned death reported tiny rural area father lives. Turns legal resident area, sickened died she'd lived years, nursing home thirty miles away.

The number newly discovered cancer cases Stockholm region 30 percent less expected, reports Medical magazine. concern cancer become advanced detected.

- incredibly serious. survival issue find cancer early treat early. often crucial result, ""Lena Sharp, director Stockholm Gotland Regional Cancer Center, told newspaper.
The Center produced statistics Region Stockholm selection database, based actual visits health care. **Data newly diagnosed cases twelve cancers analyzed get picture covid-19 pandemic affected detection cases. April May around 2,000 new cases diagnosed, 840 fewer expected appear differences different cancers.**

Lena Sharp opinion temporarily stopped mammography Stockholm yet reflected cancer statistics.

- worked yet. fairly lengthy process called screening, screening maybe research sent on. think see real effect yet,” tells Medical Journal.

Today's Medicine previously written reducing patients sought care suspected stroke heart attack pandemic. best friend highschool Brazilian/Dominican Republic, attended family gatherings often participated. friend, black, mom die immediately took home, helped situate funeral, helped get CNA license, helped get job.

Internet internet dude, person beyond screen different person online, true EVERYONE. lesson eat wild animals cut eating meat general going depend entirely state you’re in. wasn’t summer, know damn well states like Texas Florida, school would session likely would first step reopening. I'm loan officer I'm best stretch business ever last 2 months. Ah, look stoners getting knickers twist little joke.

This clearly case POT calling kettle black. Michigan illegal strike. Guess party responsible supporting that? one values ""freedom"" ""tyranny""? think crisis pushed people sick tired BULLSHIT finally start say FUCK YOU. “Our god awesome god.” school staff sacrificial lambs, they’re zooming GOP conventions doling bullshit policies ivory towers. Thanks. read it. huge study really better stats kids. study 48 children covid, 80% preexisting chronic health conditions. also mentions pediatric ICU mortality 4.2% compared 62% adults, is, case severe puts patient ICU, whether recover. least 80% covid positive people require hospitalization. smaller percent go ICU. 4.2% number may die. seems extremely extremely small number. Noting course even one death terrible. going worse two weeks, waited til days cases skyrocketing be, couldnt imagine anyone understanding pulled anti-mask people come around. Many needlessly die interim, economic reality letting virus run free peer democracies quashed it..... Republican sheriffs cowboy hats shooting unmasked come fall Square States, evangelical preachers getting visions Jesus wearing mask. College football isn’t happening, matter level division may be. Really unfortunate would end world didn’t ability make vaccine? Genuinely curious would wiped everyone eventually happened 200 years ago. Yeah, tough situation lot people. think majority people kids kids bit older virtual classrooms somewhat reasonable solution , assume easy all. friend mine 6th graders said bad, kids go rooms turn computers. 

At end day many people luxury working home still need place kids go learn cared for. people without kids sub care. thought is...""You kids problem...why foresee global pandemic last year?"" states teachers lose jobs pensions striking :/ not, pandemic? Let's put perspective countries. 


The ""chaos"" far far less e.g. St Petersburg Russia. number 560+ says all. true, also problem found recently real chance confuse 2. 

It also could factor couple dengue ""outbreaks"", including Florida. since we're talking mainland China, making sure actually dengue apparently standard tests confuse two reason.

In words, test positive dengue, symptoms look like dengue, actually covid, vice versa. never stopped hear saying. robust safety net pie sky idea years making, ever.

What *do* ability care 8-10 hours week day, even solve issues. 

I abused kid, *lived* school. Friday afternoons always depressing two school-less days ahead me. May? May worst *summer* coming. rates really low home loans ""Most deaths could avoided"" ignores 1 5 people 80 years old survived ICU care. Drat! Thanks. try repost, might able tomorrow. Yeah, mean look middle east, clearly carefully managed conflict thanx US agree things need shut down, government isn’t enough compensate places mandatory closings. Generally, government takes away right (such right contract/earn livelihood) person taken compensated fair amount. instances remind bit eminent domain. government right take property, return, right compensated. happening here, that’s people screaming “MY RIGHTS!”

While may perceive selfish—putting right livelihood other’s right lives—they aren’t completely wrong. aware stimulus packages, think aware packages (perhaps understandably given quickly passed) provide adequate relief lot businesses directly affected. 

It’s complicated issue, hope nuance understanding lost lines drawn sand. friend teacher literally preparing death generous report doesn’t imply causation correlation significant mutation D614G one, happened back February (although press acts like happened now). Every indication nothing worry about. Looks like using ""I feel threatened"" prepare stand-your-ground case. nut job looking excuse start shooting. ""Churches eager reopen. major source Caronavirus cases."" someone (again) says “at least death rates low”....check again, turning around moving upwards.

And exponential growth is, next couple weeks aren’t going fun. people saying it’s 10,000 people months back, it’s 100,000. point become big deal? 3M basically 1 100 people US spreading rapidly. 0.2% risk death sound like much compare millions teachers across nation going back teach? that's lowest risk group. many 50+ teachers nearing retirement. unfortunate result wearing mask twisted partisan political statement. obvious end result administrations efforts keep us ‘calm’. spent months telling young people virus isn’t dangerous knew wasn’t lethal healthy young people. tell new information idiots say science can’t make mind shouldn’t listened to. polls consistently shown Americans favor lockdown, can't anything minority since we're homes avoiding them. consequences ny actions? feel threatened! Heating virus kills them? thought suppose inject bleach course. death count rate stay low forever. Religious peoples actions throughout pandemic done much relieve guilt believing god. I’m sorry loss.

Do know type cardiomyopathy was? kinds warrant rest family screened it. people made fun people saying “wait two weeks” months ago? wonder people feel virus widespread. Well, good freaking morning. Nope. opened rich people panicked economy. Trump's quote, irl. Yeah. play Russian roulette don’t die old age later. We’re gonna die anyway eventually, now.

And discuss earlier statement pay property tax disagree.

Parents pay property taxes already get pay in. Childless people pay property taxes subside property tax paying parents. Thankfully, *think* *is* happening months whistleblowers raising alarm press reporting it. Sweden lucky vocal minority often suffered extreme abuse majority speaking issue. seem like calls change *are* effect, excess death rate correct (it back near baseline now). I’m willing guarantee US get vaccine, it’s going outrageously expensive. Don’t get wrong, vaccine great; think Trump going make vaccine affordable every American, got another thing coming. Hmm Az death rate increasing. COVID deniers saying “well even though cases hospitalizations up, least death rate 

Time blame China Wuhan Virus! actually read book instead throwing things don’t like they’d quarantining. Bible absolutely contains measures quarantine recklessly zealous. Yup is. hope speedy recovery rest although probability quite low since new understand world done China did.

China clearly found things work. 

Keep people home 6-8 weeks. Provide food need come out. people get sick, take away families rest family get sick. Remember temporary hospitals? closed 1-2 months nobody needed use them. 

Everybody else streets? Full fucking protection. 

I care numbers China probably inaccurate. Nobody testing 100% people. Nobody includes pnuemonia deaths reporting. Strokes. Heart failures. Nobody tests corpses. 

But China lockdown anymore! infrastructure place new cluster (like beijing) crops up, lock things again. 

NEXT : thousand sick people city, HK / TW / S. Korea! Everybody wears cheap surgical type mask. sold USD20 box 50 HK. partial lockdown, home school everyone, quarantine international people 14 days away families. (We THIRD WAVE HK now, 21 new cases, think cos stopped external quarantine). 

You could worse Sweden. UK / Italy / Spain still deaths per capita Sweden? means lockdown CAUSED DEATHS country anything. 

The Spanish flu lasted 3 years guys. 

It's July. 8 months. Mean Sweden schools stayed open along. 1 dead 20 years age. people?

Shove it, shithead. post three articles today say ""this good news"" mark good news, kinda tells lot. America collection 50 Arizonas, different stages There’s already study Spain showing herd immunity may possible antibodies don’t stay present body long. everyone else, title says ""airborne"", able make past first 6 words. stupid. win? People bending backwards make excuses can’t wear masks. follow-up face shield option is, I’m wearing I’ll look stupid. say it’s I’m selfish wear something may help others it’s hot. It’s simple. bad frames bad light. Call local government too, live AZ supposed go back 5 weeks. governor us open would funding staff/teachers paid. 

I really like district superintendent board levelheaded people, government kind forces hand giving hard choices like either pay funding open. Shocked Pikachu face be. They. Will. Be. Even vaccine within year, I’ve talked refusing get it. fast tracked everything even people would normally get vaccines don’t think safe. DeSantis doesn’t care half state dies COVID, he’s gonna blame “antifa” protests, visitors states, cooties, whatever, way shameless presidential campaign ever 2024. Come man, let us shit America. Satanist one conflicting topics. strongly believe seperation church state. also believe everyone wear mask public building. Churches, Synagogues, Temples, etc. places large groups public gather, exempt mandated mandatory mask orders. global pandemic getting worse. Religion healthy good way cope stress, going religious gathering without masks infecting entire congregation good anyone. religious community completely isolated everyone else except religious community would risking community; however, know case risk infecting anyone come contact store, visiting friends/family, etc. Both, sir, both. company relatively open people risk factors. really fall 'risk factor' group, see reason congregate together already successfully worked home long. plenty people actually want go office, though, may minority. would feel comfortable people serious safety measures time get better understanding virus toll takes long-term. gotten vibe management fall virus-is-a-hoax crowd too, make confident either.

I would open infrequent office trips critical meetings etc, tell everyone go back simply bodies desks. think it, buildings may occupancy requirement taxes, surely kind stuff could relaxed conditions. Yep. frustrating him. HAHA- GOOD. I'm sick religion. Let Darwin themselves. Can't that, American work 2 jobs 29 hours week benefits either. I’m similar situation. unemployment bad I’m whatever keep job now. refuse go office I’ll lose house. R/Conspiracy daily Covid-19 hoax posts.

Now much frozen banana Mr. Manager? I'd rather wear mask stay inside another 3 months.

The next day remembered, thinking milkshakes. virus mess mind lol Wow, crazy. wonder broke CA 5 states numbers would look like couple States. Probably par others. thing won’t even start lol Wait what, HOW? praying? Statistically, bad decision children go make terrible life decisions. I’m sure anecdotes make us feel warm fuzzy, aren’t facts. Sweden deaths reported COVID death month death.

Deaths indeed down, many people point current day's deaths exclaim deaths waaay down. ""26 Percent of Americans Say Revolves Around Earth.* Yes reason decline small part due fact isolating, mask wearing gathering local dinner 50% fish supper. really is. stopped trying explain things idiots Facebook. like talking brick wall. way respond shit like say hope kids ones die star yours. Acceptable losses. bunch misinformation pushing. contradictory, too. 

First all, even know herd immunity even possible vaccine. whole point herd immunity ""all"" get it. stops transmission without infecting everybody. 1% right line death rate healthy young adult.

Let's say parent skittle, risk playing doesnt get money needs tasty skittle. money necessary pay bills without behind, even farther behind late fees.

She's single parent wrong choice means orphan children. Mayor Phoenix AZ confirmed CNN hospitals using crisis triage able treat everyone requiring attention. means they're denying treatment people would otherwise gotten medical care. WTF America? Vienna people got 50 € card city (only) spent restaurants. It’s already pretty clear India prepared like China initially managed keep spread well contained failed like America opening up. don’t know say lockdown wasn’t working, praised beginning well handling pandemic. lockdown reason weren’t hit harder sooner US beginning weren’t locking early would far US cases deaths That's foreign language departments called, World Language department teach... languages... around world... So. Yeah. issue ventilators Covid, - many cases - actually causing harm good. 

 April, [Washington reported ""In New York’s largest hospital system, many coronavirus patients ventilators didn’t make it""

[Modern Health reported ""hospitals reported unusually high death rates coronavirus patients ventilators, doctors worry machines could harming certain patients."" 

Generally speaking, 40% 50% patients severe respiratory distress die ventilators, experts say. 80% coronavirus patients placed machines New York City died, state city officials say.

Higher-than-normal death rates also reported elsewhere U.S., said Dr. Albert Rizzo, American Lung Association's chief medical officer.

Similar reports emerged China United Kingdom. One U.K. report put figure 66%. small study Wuhan, Chinese city disease first emerged, said 86% died.

The reason clear. may kind shape patients infected. could related sick become time put machines, experts said.

But health professionals wondered whether breathing machines might actually make matters worse certain patients, perhaps igniting worsening harmful immune system reaction.""

This many doctors moved using ventilators shifted treatments also explains initial panic ventilators stopped realised damage causing. definitely needs study conjecture validated. Oh silly physics stuff. friend friend hardcore-flat-earther-conspiracy-theorist. Full-on ""5g causes Covid"" type guy. weird he's one nicest people know, smart (potentially), yet talks incessently believe gravity scientific principles. get it...like think likely, ENTIRE world EVERY scientist aspect technology based unknown alternative series principles laws making everything possible-due even larger conspiracy.....or wrong?
It's people believe things don't...it's simply cannot comprehend basic logic critical thinking fail entirely, completely refuting facts millions observed measured independently one another. Like brain completely broken what? I'm fine differing beliefs religion politics etc, own...but wrong brain deny basic scientific principles? reference Life Brian, excellent Monty Python movie. Wait Scientologists Catholic Church? Taiwan managed contain coronavirus without lockdown. grew Jersey, looking forward new wave adults throwing toddler-like temper tantrums public. Yeah getting UV indoor school setting? applied results situation particular. scenarios, especially outside, wind UV help greatly. Unfortunately many indoor environments almost mimic wind tunnel conditions use these. That's true though live Singapore basically opened almost everything except clubs places worship Sweden reached per capita test capacity Norway, approximately Wait. mean thing told y’all would happen, happened? Whaaaaaaaaaaa??? People forgotten whole point flattening man curve prevent happening. 'Protestors eager protest. major source Coronavirus cases.'

A mass gathering mass gathering, regardless cause.

Just reminder everyone uptick confirmed cases due many factors, focus one single aspect may spread from. get caught sensationalized media campaigns. Problems complex due multiple variables. Everyone blood hands point. Yes, even peaceful protestors. Schools also money resources NBA protect bubble corona coming *inside bubble* time accountability. concentrate fix. sinking titanic. fair, hearing fits narrative west people China/Hong Kong fed carefully censored propaganda Preface: I'm American biased squarely anti-trump camp. 

That said, made lots money shorting entire market based preprints saying, conversely Trump admin saying february.

It 100% fact Trump downplayed severity start, despite increasingly frantic warnings starting 3rd week Jan.

It 100% fact ""call china out"" trying hide initial cluster 5-10 strange pneumonias related seafood market first week Jan. 

Trump withdrawing funding merely political spin campaign absolve blame whatsoever, create strawman base. read preprints, read situation reports. knew coming, put money mouth bet entire US economy part, WHO's situation reports. whole ""Bubble"" idea cockamamie begin with.  biden? Yeah look forward lol looks like cases, started rise time lockdowns ended. completely unexpected, signs plateauing going back outside states good mask adoption.

I think kills excuse rise solely caused protests. Yeah, comparing Sweden Finland, Denmark Norway makes much sense.
It look good! comparing apples oranges, apples COVID cases oranges COVID deaths. They're two different measurements, Simpson's paradox applies to.

Also, Simpson's paradox relates rates, like positive rates, death rates, total sums.

Simpson's paradox would if, say, hospitalization rate decreasing looked multiple states data aggregated together, hospitalization rate actually increasing individual state. could happen if, say, New York state higher hospitalization rate measurement period, New York State cases earlier measurement period cases later measurement period. happens, high hospitalization rate New York would drag overall hospitalization rate earlier measurement period.

It's super unintuitive, wikipedia article really good examples might make expert means, bachelor's statistics covered Simpson's paradox class think it’s terrible move leave WHO, think join back trump out, heard NPR bill Melinda gates foundation second largest contributor behind US. Florida like “fuck curve, we’re going mountain.” reason US pulled Paris agreement. 

Same reason US pulled Ian Nuclear Deal.

Same reason US abandoned Kurds Syria.

Same reason US pulled Open Skies Treaty.

Same reason US pulled of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces treaty (which around since cold war).

**And reason Trump.**

There likely could more, ones recall.

For justifiable reason unbiased. head scratchers. 

Trump's claim ""harm America"" evidence do.

Democrats believe Trump trying weaken US alliances appease Putin Russia. 

The Democrats logic Russia facing heavy global sanctions various reasons, biggest annexation Crimea around 2014. sanctions effective strong global alliances western nation's (typically led US). sanctions hurt Russian economy. Russia trying weaken western alliances weaken sanctions.

By pulling agreements/treaties Trump proving US cannot trusted. make deal US 4 years new guy come renege agreement. US cannot trusted western countries cannot trust sanctions weakend. Classic divide concur.

I'm sure sounds heavily bias, objectively two different explanations I'm aware of. live backwater bigot brigade area... good luck lawsuit doomed failure. sound weird given biggest branch Christianity (Catholicism) backs science time including teaching evolution. Good, yes, probably hitting threshold probably reduction going forward due stress staff, holidays, etc. We'll see! Really place it’s crowded can’t distance. But, yes, guess it’s probably reaction dopes packed boardwalks holiday weekend. Welcome brexit line thinking.

We hate countries deciding rules, we're going leave EU.

Now say rules, still abide order trade anyway Thank you. agree, saying they’re old kind brushing off. society, need following precautions give people risk safety net. 

I hope family stays safe healthy. Thank insight. know little it, going mom sister law told seeing WebMD. cardiologist say almost certainly genetic young, know one else family suffered this. stressful upsetting. brother great guy, didn’t deserve this. Glad understand meant, many mental acuity realise Andorra, San Marino (with populations thousand) relevant.

That leaves Belgium worse death record UK six times smaller population

I know /s looking data well data Take time actually research virus spreads. particular look Chinese restaurant COVID study. It’s clear spending extended period time enclosed space others high risk especially can’t wear mask while

Possibly refusing number fudge reliable narrator.  idea anyone don’t live been. Likely far worse things could ever imagine focus ask things seem egregious yourself. Reddit...what’s real reason people don’t wear mask? want people change need gain understanding people do. Many states failed anticipate reopening would lead surge infections adults 18 35, Deborah Birx, physician overseeing White House pandemic response, said Tuesday. Younger people largely complied stay-at-home orders early months pandemic, “but saw people social media, went about,” said.


Oh bullshit. see people partying. got mixed messages leadership result stopped taking seriously. can't say open back also tell people stay inside. can't tell people wear masks time downplaying serious virus is. mixed messaging led people defying public health advisories officials. put younger people. older generation stopped giving fuck well.


Maybe real problem Birx fact get president side briefings. Fauci would tell people wear masks least face coverings Trump would immediately get tell people optional. know Birx Fauci perfect dealing novel virus means know everything it. However, letting president muddy messaging completely probably reason cant get control lot different states now. Regardless whether want schools open fall looking likely like mass layoffs coming state local governments. Since police budgets sacrosanct, expect deep cuts everything else. don’t even know respond he’s building large following... really need new friends expect deaths spike next couple weeks, trailing new infections due asinine conduct Southern states. remains seen, it’s factually inaccurate claim deaths spiraling upward US right now. They’ve trending weeks, suspect improved treatment methods keep numbers accelerating dramatically saw April/May. people go inside bathroom masks, pros outside disappear.

I would argue ""disappear"" *lessened*.

The number people exposed inside time spend inside smaller going bathroom versus hanging inside. 

Clearly best option stay outside though. beach, pee water like normal person. Also stop destroying habitats wild animals. Lol I’m sure wasn’t hundreds thousands low iq protestors churches. runs joke sub? always churches never religious buildings American, kind agree /u/ignenrintegra evenly divided world power would ideal. NGL, American hegemony second best option position. hegemon going stack deck favor, winner I'd rather side... want puke every time see disgusting spray tanned face. thinks looks great, like thinks covid control. Well target never gain keep numbers controll. kept control cases low compared earlier. US numbers still going however shows lockdown positive effects end result. know :( 

It heartbreaking, difficult comprehend hits young people quickly. feel whole family.

I know specific percentages, quite possible genes form cardiomyopathy yet stay asymptomatic mild disease. final diagnosis brother cardiologist able advise future screenings possibly genetic testing make sure stay healthy. somehow managed overtake degeneracy Youtube comments. Let’s say 2% it.......so what? asymptomatic. Young people, age 65, smaller chance dying corona flu. I’m conversation. Protect elderly, let young people develop herd immunity stop fucking entire world economy something trivial. want talk reality? healthy 25 year olds sitting home getting bonus money government people high risk groups still going work every day get deemed “essential”. Blanket lockdowns stupidest policy recent memory. want believe Florida implode? Go right ahead, would need bomb dropped middle Miami even come close death numbers NY NJ locked twice hard. I’m done conversation. Believe want stay inside forever. really don’t give fuck anymore. countries want infected masses. Just. Stay. Home.! High school teacher here. make return person, I'll wearing respirator P100 filters airtight safety goggles. care.

Overcrowded, masks, social distancing, people walking willy nilly aisles instead following clearly marked arrows. parking lots packed I’ve actually drove by. Irony finest. Churches 100% business point going catch it.

Either Oxford maybe Pfizer one works distributed October US reaches herd immunity.


There middle ground.

One happen. Well know 100% sure next month. LA majority people hospital young people now. Many die India upon time... talk antibody tests, talks testing active infection - ""even without symptoms"" - PCR.  can't make money quarantined, Churches need money. Well yeah, sure. 

But seems like chamber completely empty 99.9% percent time. What's even funnier time Business Owners risk takers! justify wage slavery, ""Well they're taking huge risk putting capital without guaranteed return!""

But are, risk coming fruition, yet risk takers yelling us need help trading lives risk.

Dear business owners: global pandemic exactly kinda thing risk running decide go business yourself. save enough money, make enough money, either cease business plague convert something less risky, that's problem ours. sole purpose coming back limelight split vote give Trump better chance--just like Buttigieg Sanders. better way attract ""right people"" spout fear-mongering ideas religious right.

Probably didn’t help US left WHO. Malasya locked sea  saw little deterioration **infectiousness** aerosols 16 hours

Emphasis mine. Fauci? listens guy, I'm gonna trust uncle Facebook propaganda one! /s White adult property owners lives matter! shareholders' lives matter! can't see clearly lives matter?!?!??? Worldometer show 60k yesterday USA. sure stat shown. where's citation, bud? (You mean medical staff kill said ""anyone Sweden get test"". agree lie, still said. I'd really like see major retailers offer prizes wearing masks public. Home Depot, Wal-Mart, Target, etc., would happy, think, sponsor program.

The winners would randomly selected awards would made public lot fanfare appreciation healthy behaviors.

Maybe award smaller prizes larger prizes well. 

I sure would happy contribute prizes! no, low death rate deaths significantly lag infections. Wow could possibly wait longer?!! What? Israelites? Quarantine? Says who? God givith... god taketh away. Pretty sure somewhere fictional piece work. update every 24 hours. totals tests administered last couple days. Long Island NY also Main Street villages lasted weekend two .

Too damn expensive unrealistic cover 50% churches Mammon care dies suffers actions. pass collection plate. I'm chuckling idea CA Seattle closing ports, entire collective West Coast shipping trying squeeze Columbia get Portland. 8000 people die per day average (pre covid) USA Oh no. hope nothing happens anti-science god believers. would awful. awful. wont kid, cares? (this really way people think) Means literally nothing. mean yea stupid, also remember people deal crisis different ways. Denial infamous first stage grief, followed anger. i'd ask personal anxiety, treatment random flu-like symptom patients different age covid, average person keep safe, biggest need hospital, whether number ""drug seekers"" gone down, probably something personal habits right (are eating out, wearing mask walmart, etc etc) why? 


that drives mad, this? could possibly reason?

You cover face sneeze, wipe ass shit, violently opposed well? demand everyone spit other? respond AIDS pandemic, forcing unprotected sex among parishioners mass? 

It utter insanity. putting context around inflammatory headline detailing thread? Honestly? pretty good here. things agreed on, part group effort. red states...red states seeing shit. Florida acting! They're thinking kids opening Disney World! /s work church. services since early March immediate plans reopen. we're right helping people rent, utilities, food, etc. number exceptions town, though. going pretty. correct. Google search, got number NYC. lockdowns worked, many people die?

If lifting restrictions allowing people wear masks go chipper, presents real danger, come infections deaths continued decrease?

Peak infection hit lockdown, decreased - lockdown - virus reached peak, declined virus does. 

That's lockdowns effect that's lifting restrictions effect. Nowhere antibody tests promised, especially VG. store quietly approach someone isn’t wearing mask doesn’t seem confrontational. also openly display box disposable masks talk them. lead saying July 7th, masks required. offer disposable mask forgot bring own.

Had 1 guy quietly ask required shop said statewide. said “that’s bad” walked away. Totally fine, you’ll problem everywhere bud.

Had father presumably teenage son come sans mask. asked mask kid answered proceeded ask something was. said I’ll happy help need mask on. dad got real loud “we’ll we’ll go somewhere else then” matched volume said sir would like disposable mask. met “hell no”. whatever 

It’s simple. can’t handle mask options. Delivery curbside pick up. take employees stores job. Stop selfish. different seat belt required law. Stop making rights issue. control, man, control! WANT afraid!!! /s cancel whole ass year. presentation high school scary. come Catholic family spent alot time churches years.  correct thats disgusting behaviour.  avoid spreading virus cost. dont care inconvenient, dont feel right contributing anyone suffering.  Thats christian anyone.  people clearly play pretend christian way feel people isnt about... good people seek care, bad infrastructure can't handle it. 

The doctor article linked within one OP specifically says: move chairs get stressed 80-year-olds sit waiting room young people come prove covid. also find many patients careful used be, ”she pandemic, were, among things, tents patients assessed outside emergency room. significantly fewer people seek covid symptoms, reasonable staff, says Katrin Hruska. Mälar Hospital, patients respiratory symptoms isolated rooms, efforts made reduce risk try keep apart move chairs apart distance waiting room, can't maintain many patients. even patients care much come something call health care center before. also seen people, example, seek stomach ache, also cough on. 


Since distance cannot kept, bad people mixed waiting rooms increases chances spreading COVID. church actually growing pandemic. embracing remote worship actually helping smaller churches service communities hit hard job losses. won’t reopen it’s safe per state, local, cdc. main reason given reopen don’t want bad neighbor bad witness gospel haste reopen. Disappointing see churches fail understand that. Imagine isn’t though. Reinfection multitude long term health effects coupled herd immunity vaccine. might never really reach zero. church allowing 1/3 families go week (something like A-H one week, I-Q, R-Z), discouraging anyone 65 coming (which probably makes 50% members), basically got 1/6 many people go, even go. Masks required, social distancing, meeting hour long, instead regular two hours. also Zoom set go. feel like reasonable approach. Fuck that, they’re smart will, really care shitty job much? sure don’t, I’ll gladly tell customers they’re idiots don’t wear masks, fire that’s better go back unemployment, cool Billy Joel expressed similar sentiment.

I see Jonathan Edwards might prefer crowd guilty conscience. quote Carlin: “if everything God’s will, bother praying? if, you’re praying goes God’s will?” I’m amazed humanity lasted long. Science! Praise Science! Except hot countries (you know, summer winter) outbreaks. America acted like super new confusing loads evidence coming world. far remember, Devil never actually kills anyone entire Bible. One could argue serpent's temptation Eve (sidenote, Bible actually say serpent Satan, assumed many case) cause human suffering come. However, God created humans Devil, completely aware would happen. So, one would justified arguing God ultimate engineer human suffering, assuming even exists first place. lost game never could won. Correct. clearly missing increasing amount people states like Arizona. 

But amount people missing New Jersey going far lower, far lower New jersey two months ago. 

Just throwing static, overall number like ""10-1"" going misleading inaccurate. mean.... think plague upon lands good thing? like fast cars dangerous sports wouldn’t equate adrenaline rush science denying cunt. 

Fast cars dangerous sports mathematical equations.

People don’t wear PPE get hurt time across industries.

In OSHA training trained specifically counter objections science deniers. Unfortunately best line defense issue warning fire said person violating safety protocols.

Typically PPE protects wearer people still don’t want wear it. public health emergency innocent bystanders risk question, needs required. i'm worried side effects too. Dr Fauci says life expectancy reduces 15 year. i'm exactly sure means that; would apply young people. that's makes america great, duh live flordia. fucked. Remember trump fudge huricane graph fit narrative. hope someone records history. Every false claim. millions believe information truths. Ducey never closed bars night club Navajo reservation either evidence back up? People tend throw around made stats. 

Parents I’ve spoken least pro-having option. Granted, didn’t conduct poll, it’s awesome New York schools offering families. much drama tiny, thin piece fabric. incredible spoiled portion world population is. still humans cope war, shortage basic necessities hunger every day, people scream bloody murder tiny piece fabric? Seriously? especially baffling consider church deliver services entirely online. can't eat restaurant online, can't work gym online. get spiritual edification heart desires online. Cause Christians don’t give fuck people, practice religion faith home, doesn’t mean church Yeah dead people go Heaven now. Checkmate atheists 1% USA dies, that's 3 million people.


The cult45 willing let many die Trump elected one believes omniscient omnipotent deity, feels bit odd praying internet alone would somehow count... cities large protests significant spike COVID cases found. get cancelled.  C’mon folks, know this. used churches opening up, realizing there's strong intersection conservatism willful obstinance COVID concerned, new position people basically deserve cooties. Screw'em, let get sick. Let infect close friends loved ones. 

&amp;#x200B;

Those us ""libtards"" responsible protecting morons stupidity. Darwinism action. I'd like point every church like this. diocese shut immediately remained shut state entered phase 3 reopening. even then, strictest guidelines following including social distancing, 10% capacity, masks, face shields, collections, sign peace, hand sanitizer enter communion designated areas take mask eat host immediately leave. work infectious disease think anything could done better. Elevated CFR among medical workers strongly suggestive that, least, high innoculatory dose translates heightened chance severe disease. numbers constitute major factor covid thing over. publish scientific paper. kind inside info golden long we're working home again? wen't back office June 15th. stoned principle none less. agree seem minority process certain number covid tests per day, exponential increase number cases.

Big thonk dont really choice :( forced go church every week 300+ members. adults want us shake hands greet I'm kinda screwed. So, good stop it? even point posting article? Lol even you’re supposed using law?

Surely people WW1 WW2 felt times, nations come through, better. world really filled horrible people, louder kind reasonable ones. considered finding mental health care person talk to? dangerous stay frame mind. person posted directly textbook. Smallpox DNA based Virus. COVID RNA based virus. Smallpox relatively mutation averse COVID mutation prone. Essentially DNA creates error checking capability replication, ensuring mutations infrequent. RNA single strand error checking, mutations arent discarded.

That's also Smallpox could eradicated. mutated infrequently enough Vaccine could used whenever outbreaks occurred. Contrast influenza shotgun different flu strains vaccine still miss largest outbreaks.

When comes less deadly simple survival fittest. Whatever mutation spreads easiest largest percentage disease known coloqually known COVID-19. general ones spread least deadly. majority people infected infected less deadly strain. deadly strain still alive, kicking, higher mortality rate. general knowledge society wont delve different strains COVID-19. people one strains die less often. course, Darwin never level understanding. Understanding importance kin raising children social species understood till much later.

This absurdly academic discussion, meant making fun morons, debating subtleties selection. That’s articles like do. take preliminary study’s results blow proportion get scared people’s clicks. fact enough data make reasonable indication long term effects going be. won’t know until... long term. 3 10 years finally see data come scientific consensus, first 7 months. I’m blaming people screwed six ways come Sunday entire live.

(Since ""quarantine"" 1600s Italy) cases staying level 10 states? 50 states getting new cases? Maybe number new daily cases increasing 40 states. genuinely don’t believe you.
 
Saying it’s worth risk, sure - I’ve seen those.
 
Saying cause important **it can’t spread virus**? No. isn’t thing. working 29hrs week 2 jobs? I’ve burning along 70+hrs 2 years. finally situation February cut 1 job ol ‘rona came along. I’m back 2 there’s guarantee either around fall. *has* massive concerted effort marginalize people disabilities, certainly start pandemic. Seriously, actual reading disabilities studies learn disabilities activists. great curbside working area -- that's case everywhere know feel need jump rescue society America broadly can't possibly know experience people disabilities every community?

Also, abled people using abled people faking disabilities undermine legitimate concerns people disabilities disgusting. never argument make. getting downvotes nobody time enlightened centrism. getting anything done. know, save tens thousands lives well making lifetime career making discovery. Germany Catholic Church single biggest land property owning entity country. tax subsidized. previously trusted Swedish people things regarding Sweden. related virus even regards culture, relation neighbouring countries, reaction behaviour Swedish people whole regards pandemic etc.

Why would Sweden differ?

(This personal attack harassment.) Well know everyone doctor except actual doctors, paid crisis actors bullshit. interview horrible many ways. that. interviewee said stated Sweden yet hit peak. Ann Linde responds following

""Two weeks ago started massive testing virus, meaning everybody every single person, don’t even slightest symptoms, go test yourself. course means much much much greater number viruses that’s wrong look situation. ""

She referring fact lot infected look statistics. that's test virus. However extensive testing case Stockholm time. either way statement true. fact talking antibody testing.

Here link, discussion starts around 3 min Yes, sweats. Bite me. get churches bring people together, need stop services virtual. hundreds people one room? Talk quarantine clusterf*ck! wife works school I'm nervous go back. works special ed kids wouldnt understand social distancing, masks, coughing others faces, etc. 

On plus side, class size small already social distanced sense. 

But also heard word school district plan doing. complete radio silence. 2 months away; plans already. incredibly frustrating. even trying argue? Lockdowns work, that’s Europe downward trend. It’s climbing India eased lockdown, lockdown prevented India ramping Jan Feb given proximity China article seems preconceived opinion. uses unproven anecdotes writer admits says hear time. 

The writer also advocates masks calling ""Nuts"".

Cases surging, deaths surging, mean anything right really. aunt hospital 3 months complications Covid, ended dying. family members hospital weeks passed away. 

I see deaths increasing weeks now. 


Also, need tests record scale. disease cure. sensible person would want accurate tracking disease can. Yup yup yup

Sending kids school sick happens time. Staff too. 

Every teacher stories kids coming school sick dog sent back classroom nurse whatever reason. 

But imagine happens workplaces (probably worse paid sick leave). But...but...im lazy.
/s wanted post quote/tweet Trump:

Meanwhile, president also tweeted Wednesday morning that: ""In Germany, Denmark, Norway, Sweden many countries, SCHOOLS OPEN PROBLEMS.""

Now, Denmark. reason schools open without problems practically eradicated Corona virus here. whole country 18 people hospitalised it. new cases get tracked contacts.

This comparable situation American states, bear mind read statements. Trump demands person schools open time wonder reverse normal start dates. Fucking ISIS better response shit. Christians getting Corona. Satan approves

OH, GUESS EVERYONE ELSE TALKING AIRBORNE? 


Hmm....... 


IN FUCKING FEBRUARY 2020

 
Fuck stupid mofos insisted ""it's droplet! droplet!"" ""There's proof!"" 


Fuck lives hands. tried explain numbers friend mine awhile back floored perspective. 1% seems small reality still millions people. isn’t small anymore. 

This things got though. she’s taking seriously. good news there. 86 deaths 16000+ cases. ""Only"" .5% deathrate. need Florida since governor says virus affect youngsters say that? Discussions state federal government (since outbreaks one state, everyone else fine low cases) figure still ongoing. Watch space? *Flagged Desean Jackson propaganda* God decided time weed stupid. Unfortunately, changed broad-brush-approach much, collateral damage huge, always Thank reply. guess I’m interested future affects happening. It’s life still feels pause stability frail keep slightly gone back normal. wondering standings super powers post pandemic. “Kids take extra year school”
“This effect kids ability learn”

Do kids? expect working parents Plan B “Kids allowed go school, deal it.” one. laws? They’re old. Babysitters/Nanny’s/Tutors? can’t afford. Want us parents it? cannot work teach time unless don’t need pay house/utilities/etc. know kids fine? special needs IEPs?

Saying otherwise simplifying bad situation overall. easy cast judgement.

Nuance needed re-opening. Obviously cannot normal last year. Adjustments need made. need leadership propose reopening plans. binary choice “stay home forever” “re open like nothing happened.” ways safely tolerable risks need open them.  sucks, many daily cases city decided full lockdown again? Personally think virus going disappear vaccine it'd much rather longer period everything open restrictions rather full lockdown every six weeks. News 11  illiterate. Oh oh do, do! 

I work hotel. Masks required employees common areas hallways guests use. 

In break rooms main office behind front desk plexiglass put up, aren’t required. 

Good thing virus transmits among guests staff stopped plexiglass barrier!!!

Oh also temperature checks beginning shift. may may occur part way shift. Go something useful. want say reason that. poor people already large gotten virus. say ""control spread"" give population chunks. First urban poor. middle class. mean churches allowed take money people? country that? doubt average person would. realise 50% stupid that. Antibody test extremely flawed often reported serious infection COVID 19 antibodies. also sick winter chances sick university still cases NY. 

That said said depends locates US unlikely COVID colleges early problem late eliminate virus. Unless get vaccine virus stay.

Suppression still possible totally eliminating virus late. 

Even jurisdictions done well (Canada, South Korea, Hong Kong, Japan, etc) managed completely eliminate virus. still keeping close eye. 

New Zealand notable exception benefit sparsely populated island. 

In theory, suppose, could stop virus spreading 100-percent global quaratine (no exceptions) 6 months. cost (financial lives) would high. would mean closing grocery stores, hospitals, food production, medicine production, basic utilities etc.

People would die hunger (running food)
Other healthcare issues (no hospitals) 
Other emergencies (no utilities) They're basically killing people indirectly recently left church supportive children leaving domestic violence situation.

All asked ride get groceries. deliver groceries us (we paying everything)

They stopped returning calls.

I found still Facebook group listened message came pastor.

His response need take precautions let "" spirit fear"" take control church.

So glad left. Well yeah, claimed happening US. Ok, bud Mmm. like you. One answer: Lombardy. Worldwide. know Lombardy? Obviously not, ask did. peak, needed military take care dead... research it. Covid March 2020 Lombardy. opinion, that’s fine, don’t need make talking points support it. can’t convince others trust subject go along positions post things clearly visibly untrue. 

No one trust position. Gatekeeping would like said “you’re person don’t understand Coronavirus statistics work” Suspected, proven. Midwest overnight results. generally, person dies test confirming COVID, hospital doesn’t count confirmed COVID death. 

But tested confirmed influenza counted influenza death. seems silly. Remember “Keep Calm Carry On”? isn’t thing anymore?

I feel like morons actively anti-mask feel it’s forced them, Rage Machine literally build brand #1 hit around phrase “fuck won’t tell me” people still surprised that’s common attitude. People don’t like told do, that’s we’re getting “Muh fredomz!” backlash. 

If want get people actually something don’t make big deal don’t seem hysterical it. understand feel personally threatened it, long you’re keeping social distance, minding sanitation, wearing mask you’ll generally okay. high risk take extra measures, stay home, take advantage literal legions people would thrilled help right now.

/s think thinks really enforce it. think he's low key calling states responses. Shining light dark... understand think would cause number go down, unless talking total population area, counting visitors, &amp; counting infections percentages positive cases. China warned airborne February. CDC chief Zhong Nanshan even showed image spreads air conditioners. Nobody cares back stated China lying. Dude timeline events wrong. 16% 48548. number (depending age comorbidities) die. So... Closer 7.7 K people antibodies 50 ish dead That's entirely fair.

I want dox anyone else, either! wish hip hop career going well. taking zinc would still dead.

Please tell there's SOMETHING mind happened us Lol youjust dont call science results process disagree already held viewpoints would incorrect.

Disagreeing disbelieving someone else's beliefs ""gaslighting"", matter moronic short sighted disagreements may be. 

Gaslighting specific choice made make someone question reality knowingly misleading/manipulating them. intent important gaslighting *abusive*. 

Families disagreeing whether spank children, whether climate change real, racism still problem US, approach covid-19 ""gaslighting"". family drama bullshit everyone dealing generations previous dealing generations come. 

Misusing term gaslighting delegitimizes real phenomenon real abuse victims broadening meaninglessness. never denied that. it’s 30% population rest states leave us with.......


70% someone made claim. asked source. gave source. quoted part source supported claim went autistic. Thank you! Radioactive insane avoiding contact permanently. “Health care workers scared, show work every single day,” Patel said. Wearing masks, said, “is small thing ask.”

It small thing ask.

But important start articulating need lockdown.

A mask help reduce spread critical right now.

But much built spread, anything short mass lockdowns catastrophic. correcting ~~spelling~~ grammar mistake? makes sense. 

FTFY sounds like describing reaction remaining static. read? again, anecdotal evidence.

again, im going say might harsh - always dealing hard cases pretty much 1%-5% cases, many people infected obviously young people health conditions die.

I know get choose safe, everyday fight conspironas think virus fake dangerous always wear mask - im fear monger trend goes means im protecting rules? know much yet, make seem like many 30-40 year olds gonna die ain't true.

&amp;#x200B;

out 9000+ dead Germany 105 age 50, 200000 confirmed cases (not even IFR ) almost 86000 infected age group (pretty much age group biggest number infections ).

that alone death rate 0.1% , again, confirmed cases. FL’s best!  Seriosly? Check one. math? Ok sorry. know wash hands lol im chef, know name protocol. hate news stay home work thats lol Oh someone need nap juice? Absolutely, mean sincerity, fuck guy trainer small, independent fitness studio (I'm owner) tell vast majority gym owners believe. NBD kind thing. Whatever takes get people back inside sweating breathing hard paying monthly dues. I've fitness industry long time, people position feel they're invincible they're relatively young, fit eat right. They'd end ""just bad cold"" got it. Well bunch built systems. are...making choice. option voting. depressing me. first time since shelter place order saw people wearing masks grocery shopping past weekend North Texas.I allowed sliver hope maybe, maybe people would accept mask requirement knew would receive fine wearing one. like driving speed limit, one enforce it, majority people won't. anti-mask crowd learns there's repercussions wearing back square one. 8 people called work today. 4 tested Covid-19. We've gone 1 confirmed case 5. I'm hoping enough hospital beds staff Fourth July infections start tallying up. I’m using Worldometers chart. 5 typical Saturday Sunday, uncommon Monday — small important difference. resisted decades efforts

It's interesting straight refuse acknowledge way investment priorities guided feasibility vaccine development relates things like SARS MERS. brought earlier thread, ignored it.

I'm jumping conclusions. I'm saying definitely going happen. I'm going data have, - far (and stress ""so far"" part) - looks promising. Looking data saying ""nope"" based real information counter actual scientific progress far deliberate choice making, reinforced anything substantial. absolutely nothing suggest vaccine failure likely successful one. simply promising data far, rest air. We'll see. That's point I'm making. Truly miracle drug, nothing concrete evidence works. daughter die Covid never now!! entirely agree writing.

What mean convey want convince someone, must willing listen them. must ready believe people reason believe believe. Maybe bad reason, still reason.

For instance, mask deniers believe, instance, CNN reporter tells wear masks? I'm sure varies individual individual, one possible reason CNN (and competitors) pretty clear tendency a/ report bullshit anything better keep watchers' eyeballs TV; b/ take general public idiots – I'll admit idea CNN handling specific crisis, got rid TV 5 years ago.

Now, average quality CNN bubble news report awful mean better Fox bubble Facebook bubble (or reddit bubble, matter). TV consumer felt (for instance) CNN taking idiot, I'd switch another channel / news source seem like take idiot. channel actually seems care *my* problems little bit *their* problems (whoever ""they"" are). bubble happens convey somewhat consistent message masks covid, I'd tempted believe it.

Would shaming convince me? No, comes bubble, bubble already (comparatively) hostile me. would serve prove hostile bubble hostile. law police might convince reluctantly wear mask (not everyone, unfortunately, also easy see law police enemy sent hostile bubble, especially authority figure bubble already called civil disobedience).

But, recall, reason I'm bubble bubble cares problems. people bubble showed care problems, I'd much less need bubble. means could start discussing issues less central me, like masks covid.

For reason, strongly believe first step towards convincing people stop sabotaging health efforts first talk them. them. towards them, them. first step listen them, may mean letting convince us problems important (to them) problems (to us). agree priorities, solutions, cannot get stage we're listening.

Wow, longer expected :)

Are wave length?  I'd need see big proof that, like would people say grossly inflating deaths. Lol don’t know quantify exactly, extra 3-4 weeks warning see train barreling way. least could started prepare video Italian ICUs made TV. seriously, left hasn’t? 

Trump, many officials, absolutely either assholes handled well, left absolutely extreme

Coming someone leans left I'm sorry deal kind bullshit Two reassuring things: know permanent, body knows heal damage. concerned, please talk doctor. offer much better advice, including potential treatment plan, can. 

I'm similar boat, though. wife got sick early February. know sure COVID-19... I've symptoms since then, even recovered month-long pneumonia. Exercise helped heart palpitations I'm still having. exactly people taking precautions avoid catching this. 

I'm noting better catch figure much possible. nobody rushing catch that's extremely foolish.

I mean, they're running hospital services generally Houston understanding. y'all kind fucked there.... Former secdef general Mattis used say state department funded, buy bullets. us government really doing... much state department section. Exactly! get they’re kids need learn it’s cool that. actually serious question?

Has nobody paying attention? It’s July don’t know contact tracing is?

How deal pandemic:

Hygiene - wash hands
Distancing - keep away people; try go out, to, keep distance don’t go crowds, particularly indoors.
Contact tracing - someone tests positive COVID, team people combs past 48 hours week activity, contacts *every* person contact with, enforces need self-isolate/quarantine *two weeks.*
Quarantine - enforce it. Anyone disease quarantine two negative tests row. contact people. contacts people virus - *quarantine*. Self-isolation. allowed outside even go shops, police check you.

It’s actually simple.

Obviously, enforce things like distancing - that’s businesses etc get shut down. principles simple

Distancing. Tracing. Quarantine. IT.

If people above, don’t even really need masks - although course would encouraged go interact.

This way it. Unfortunately also means economic devastation.

It’s impossible choice really. Infection deaths vs unemployment isolation.

But still - steps control pandemic changed, around world. Distance. Tracing. Quarantine. places implemented enforced steps day one virus “under control”, places still asking questions like “what’s contact tracing” mess. haven't, I'm assuming thinking people contact asymptomatic people hospital. may stats google. would think possibility due MERS &amp; spreading hospitals. also think that's many people go care, life threatening health issues, avoid going.  yeah need replace people holding federal plan back start we're 300k dead going disaster... weird. explanation.  follow sub see similar question. reading 1000 posts make sure asked.  Yes, like higher IQ. unbelievable badly US handling crisis, politicizing pandemic trying ignore danger listening experts receipt disaster.

I really scared huge number new cases US, Brazil India countries may cause new mutations make even dangerous deadly next wave even costly devastating world. say article: 

""The irony asked (Kemp) allow us mandate masks Atlanta said no,"" Bottoms said. ""But called National Guard without asking needed National Guard."" Exactly. That's wrong. Someone already daily pandemic diseases would able help think? Comparatively it’s expensive, especially students $65k income go free $65k $150k spend 10% income. It’s surprising hear students graduate debt Regardless interpretation comment, know skew results either way?

It one hand make 1% lower really higher... 

You vote comment, it’s valid question. UberHearse see spike demand, too. Well people don’t want longer force want get out, everyone breaking point Yes absolutely need them. Good luck getting high compliance quarantine orders. maaah freedumb crowd even wear mask. Imagine reaction mandatory quarantine order? literally exercise 2nd amendments rights take poor LEO them. need stop many tests. number yuge nonsensical applicable discussion. rest world responds virus within borders separate issue. talking holding CCP account inability better regulate wet markets curtail animal human transmission viruses pressed so. 

I think also concerned sanctions reparations would mean access cheap labor China. 65% aren’t. think lot areas attribute higher death rate COVID....This take time decipher data actual deaths comparison areas death rates previous years...Like can’t hide death data obits long term...You downplay short term...data show us long term reality refuse ventilation? grounds would have? would’ve known doctors get 8+ years training doctoring  Lice! know feel, sometimes. take pandemic economic collapse force comfortable Americans understand many people long living impossible economics? 

If want claim guiding light world really need start walking walk. working home didn’t go office What's that? I'd rather draft. war video game makes want real go ahead. Yeah don’t know either it’s huge project lol Ahh, hip. Ya hit sore spot bud :'( Could Trump sued negligence? We’re okay going mess country. Don’t worry, want nothing states atm. Ah 35% population 50, so... “religious freedom!!!” /s Holy shit hospitals Florida actually run ICU beds? That's scary could well mean next weeks going horrific Flrodia. Let's hope become another NYC Whataboutism much? pot call kettle black, it’s accurate, black.

you conflated observation bad policy defense US policy, indefensible.

Saying USA also terrible job true, won’t help Australia much prudent mask mandate would.

And live California- mask mandate. Florida take shirt squab I'm sure South America middle East felt/feel lot safer America super power... Nice graph, what’s source that? Well podcast it’s true. California, airliftng people San Diego county Bay area. There's much actually make student family pay replacement. schools act like there's sort consequence - reality there's none. Yet schools given replacement funds, even though inevitable they'll need them. long Americans start applying Canada refugee status? Utah ICU capacity 60% hospitalizations slowly rising well. start getting AZ patients, it’s going become mess probably isn’t necessarily true look indirect deaths like Irma study Puerto Rico dumb/slightly off-topic question, sentence "" fasting forty days forty nights, hungry."" verse 4 imply even hungry prior that?

Helpful comment btw, pretty solid way counter ""God powerful X, therefore I'm going avoid X"" position. Inside house grocery store per week. articles stupid. Scaled US population, 8700 Canadian deaths equals 77,000 US deaths.

Then consider ~3 every 8 Canadiens live single province. That's equivalent one US state ~125,000,000 people.

Then consider nearly 1 every 3 Canadians lives one three metros - Toronto, Montreal, Vancouver. those, Toronto large enough top 10 US metro population. ratio population equal top *16* US metros

Then consider geographic area counties equal (including Alaska), canada 1/9 population 

Then consider us metro areas least 2,000,000 people. Canada? 3.

All say canada obviously easier time controlling spread US, given factors. mention better healthcare, factors  Per capita, US bit 1.5x deaths Canada right now. idea many excess deaths Canada though. biggest difference developed nations, including Canada, managed significantly reduce case counts manageable levels US still exploding. going scary look numbers couple months. rule never wished harm others. I've tried live life hoping best everyone come across succeeded many years.

Yet think panic happen soon Trumps stronghold Villages can't help think, ""good, maybe get taste like live someone one cares about, serves right backing asshat."" wish feel way. wondering too. Meanwhile New York cancels theirs. China definitely *trying* become world hegemon. Look South China Sea conflicts. Look countries they've bribed vote UN issues building infrastructure. whole Belt Road Initiative hugely expanding power through[debt-trap likely succeed. country gives infrastructure, free reign permit exploit people like own. Let em go.

So think companies exporting jobs that's true? Here's answer case cant figure not. Companies export jobs american regulations red tapes made economically uncompetitive things made largely hyper rich import work products countries listed, without living there. See difference? take advantage systems, helping dont live america dont see jobs going anyway, even hyper rich here. much US assembled china today? many companies shuddered, owners live comfortably here? orange figurehead says make america great, companies continue ship work overseas. I'm saying want stay, pay share taxes go. countries tax more, want stay. make sure contribute country residence. simple enough understand drop lexile lower?

Bro seriously consider asking refund educational institute failed learning think critically.

All businesses create jobs, provide services product consumption, contribute economy public thru taxes. benefits worker, consumer, public exchange, get rewarded value create. taking advantage systems helping neither?

I know popular myth floating around somehow rich people dont pay taxes. beyond false. Rich people pay taxes, pay far group top value create economy thru providing jobs, products services enjoy. group contribute economy taxes. Taxes based net income (revenue minus expenses/deductions). Guess net income? economically productive members society subsidizing want gone. Like seriously? resentful them? owe everything free? Um... click little ""x"" top right hand corner... Makes pinned recommendation go byebye...

But level resentment spreading information normal, totally normal. tired virus we’re going back thing we’re best at. Ignoring problem pretending we’re best Fauci pro-school opening.

Fauci seemed think keeping schools closed general necessary.
""Children get infected, so, yes, got careful,"" Fauci said. ""You got careful got careful may spread it. Now, make extrapolation open schools, think bit depends state. religious exemption medical neglect. parents say religion get medical help. watch what... cure stupidty data supports anything like 2% outside nursing homes.

The observed CFR US 4.33% today, Belgium observed CFR 15.8% (9,774 deaths 62,058 cases) WAIT TWO MONTHS I'm skeptical whether third paragraph come pass. Trump still something like 90+ approval rating Republicans. 90+!! base still still rabid. ""Officials confirmed 46 coronavirus-related deaths 4,015 additional cases Tuesday — highest number infections county reported single day.

That’s largely due roughly 2,000 test results backlogged July 2 July 5.

[The seven-day average county’s daily positivity rate — test positive virus — climbed 11.6%.

On Monday, 10%.""

the climb positivity rate alarming. Lately they’ve really comparing death tolls things *not* extremely contagious / infectious. strange goalpost move towards Take gravity larger scale say asteroid strikes earth. Today, know gravity. ancestors would say God threw asteroid heavens. 

All events religion credits god pocket knowledge science figured yet. pocket used far larger, science progressed answers found. course finding answers, never conclusion supernatural force.

As resurrection claim, actually happened, still easily explained. man gravely wounded loses blood point near death. become comatose days. Sometimes body stabilize own. Given many parts story church alters, I'm sure table got treatment. exactly first reaction. surprised They’re sending us best people. They’re sending us sneezy, coughing feverish. build wall, US pay it. First, nice work finding two week old comment reply to. Second, constitutional mandate. really want better fellow Americans- I’m repeatedly shaking head trying think nature’s natural selection process. aren’t increasing exponential rate

Ayyyy, orange critter, try develop brain attempt speak think, though genetics seem allow that. Also, life matter, go enjoy sad insecure circlejerking autistic orange master. Education shit sum tons dropouts... Drinking corona beach, I'm brave scared type people. works! make money! ask CEOs come business, liquidate it, leave. Like others said statement misleading.

""Children get infected, so, yes, got careful,"" Fauci said. ""You got careful got careful may spread it. Now, make extrapolation open schools, think bit believe scientists. Didn’t trump declare nursing home would liable infections? basically made legal kill grandma via neglect incompetence consequences. 

Not nursing homes historically great keeping patients healthy alive, let alone informing family patient died.  Lmaooooo try Trazodone  They're talking cfr, ifr Disagree, people still screaming old narratives -wear masks, stay home, isolate, etc- done beginning (with added caveat wearing masks let us forget people vehemently masks beginning).

Say, green? That’s exactly point, unsure went everyone’s head 

These people don’t give shit society live in. money reason. lack empathy allows steal, cheat, game system climb top. nothing new. Rapidly approaching 1000 dead today, right. Check New Hampshire. there. blast beach. Positive cases asymptomatic people equate crisis. wear mask stores requesting it. Simple. Outdoors? No. Like everyone NYC. Good. I’ll stay “terrible person”. Coming leftist it’s meaningless. Plus huge states. know logistics transferring patient would work. fly patients? Can't possibly drive them. live Phoenix single city surrounding tates would close trip. San Diego probably closest major city 5 hour drive hour flight. Lol, getting downvoted. direct source virus, still gets downvoted. Without insidious Chinese policy biowarfare, pandemic wouldn’t exist. But... downvote! Well that’s contract jobs work Would help told I'm former researcher find entirely normal speak one's beliefs based experience, long one clearly labels such? yeah, listen guy got fucked-over first place. Seriously, actual F thinking? aaaaaaaybe-may go doctor Manhattan today tour group. Unreal! Sorry miss peak NYC crisis?

Sure, feel free ride out. Otherwise, GTFO.

People talk big game, lot would choose evacuate they've ever actually ridden direct hit. can't seem figure either. virus sure mysteriously spreading own! 🤷‍♀️ Haha, care, stay mad Think increase herd immunity making vaccines development needed even though they've dumbed billions giga-brain move Agreed 100% Isn’t move de jour white people appropriate people’s things, like phrases? retired Marines, it’s really hard mentally physically. father I’d worry, don’t know parents managed. Denver area net export major region US Austin Texas. symptoms though, signs. Patients (can't) report themselves, going scan everybody? want forced ""release geese "" anything.......  nothing safe POS voted office concerned covid please quit smoking.

Call quit line!

1-800 quit lots answers question, feel like might misunderstanding here. listing examples misapplications. 16% tested positive. That's number 48k. math assumes everyone survives antibodies. 

Also, NYC locked down. follow lockdowns kind terrible human also (thankfully) minority NYC good places people like majority rapidly overwhelming hospital systems. Check Texas example. sometimes feels like last TRYING get everybody infected, including could also outdoor classes canopy’s. Kids would love would keep everyone much safer. also outdoor schools kids join. motto “no bad weather, bad attire.” something.. place view many tests conducted per day state? talking friend saying reasons cases low state testing small amount people. hoping verify somewhere. known since Diamond Princess cruise disaster. means everything fine, go applebees! wondering: 

 - assume every gun loaded
 
 - never point muzzle towards anything willing destroy

 - keep finger trigger intend shoot

trump dictator covid causing clotting, hemorrhaging, stroke coagulation inflammation related issues already highlighted quite time. Maybe repeat studies medical institute strain virus. perhaps things hectic somtimes news get needs get soon enough. Igp Atinl? stroll supermarket without mask twice week, know everything completely ignore anyone says anything.

The one time someone come say something, loudly accused pervert trying touch inappropriately. completely unprepared accusation allowed walk self checkout complete transaction. Agree. plenty time change minds next administration. next, mean anyone dumb ass. Interesting coming her; want auction highest bidder? Despicable piece shit. likely confused willingness interact someone presents themself asshole. Thank God block button. going awfully hard convince people legit.

it would better encourage people reach anyone they've around get sick.

if get call from, let's say, joe, know saw barbecue last week tells he's sick, likely believe mystery person.  Wow! gives shit! don’t eat meat dairy! It’s vaccine! Put pigs taint fire double dose arm! Let’s go! several days 2000 peak NE. Funded research, gave recommendations, good, stupid. Created guides checklists hospitals businesses. Donated supplies sent dozen doctors start outbreak. 

Nothing justifies $400M+ per year US already CDC fills similar roles IMO. 

Leaving entirely mistake (again IMO), paying required $237M/2years assessed US would reasonable.  He’s already said could, it’s last resort. Probably end month. saw someone hooked one ear, flapping face breeze. Pretty sure that's effective way wear I'm scientist know anything. official figures way lower actual numbers. 

Are seeing people dying streets without healthcare? No. that's testing rates among lowest world.

Why true? think per capita good measure testing, good measure government completely screwed response virus. staring barrel huge catastrophe.

Not going lie, extremely myopic. Nothing happened extent exaggerate. 

I'm tier 1 city that's one top 5 hit covid. there's nowhere go treatment, 911 cant get hours days, die home like many NYC. guarantee China supports W.H.O. Dr. Tedros carrying water since January. F that. I’d report boss hospital. joke, she’s cal still saying it’s nothing deal professional consequences. say someone nurse mom nurse sister - would report bosses behavior. 

My head, fucking er nurse outbreak location doesn’t notice patients *recover* permanent organ damage?! isn’t killing people lung issues, it’s causing goddamn strokes. reporting system medical professionals spreading dangerous denials (also anti vaccine nurses) right call nurse think big deal. 

FOR FUCKS SAKE STATE CALIFORNIA MANDATED MASKS PUBLIC. wear masks dayjob? Would walk surgery without scrubbing up? fucking danger patients isn’t taking masking seriously outside hospital. That's 120 per day roughly 4 times size Florida, roughly twice size California ""There important things living."" - Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, Monday, April 20, 2020

Our proudest moment, sure. Nope. teary eyed little man Americans try sneak Canada now. Stay Strong Canadians!!!! mean NY sent Covid patients nursing homes instead distancing older population virus.

States listen locked hard, things going swing open lock balance found. exponential growth vs. better treatment. money exponential growth. spelling mistake grammar mistake. word exist. word, thier not. used meteorologist

I mean. Wow. Everyone go home. guy... wow. that's solid point. Family, friends, FB aquaintances nurses can't Trump's base? family may expats New Zealand Alabama. response makes 100% sure made right decision. Texas, Florida, Arizona others festering virus - places responsibly handled virus barring entry land, sea, air anyone everyone states?

If places flocked infected efforts nothing soon enough. brand strategy usually combination get rich stay strapped. Running ruining? fuck price beans Peru. Feckless fear mongering provides meaningful context problem hand. isolate twice never test positive? people keep isolating again?

and shitheads use like swatting attempt? refused recognize pandemic late

yeah, like struggling 20,000+ cases per day July warning February late. like situation worsen everyday since then. Looked curve, going quite while. turn anyone else world ourselves. retarded, completely random worthless stat. Also kills plane crashes tinnitus. half time one team football match 20-0 unlikely team catch up. Tegnell repeatedly said peak reached, believed means halftime. peak Nordic countries squashed mercilessly. Test, Trace, Isolate strategies tested proven effective. Björn Olsen right: chances Sweden's neighbors ending outcomes similar Sweden right basically unthinkable. theory might happen, odds heavily stacked it. 

I answer personal questions debate toxic. fascinated situation part due toxicity: I've never seen debate mean spirited one side (outside climate debate is) part drew attention. [Protestors spit requesting Sweden follow international, European Nordic scientific consensus bit mind blowing tbh, representative debate conducted Swedish society generally. 

But overall situation extremely interesting myriad reasons detail here. One thing find odd people find someone developing interest special frankly quite horrifying situation odd that's used personal attack. said, likely I've read situation point, Swedish not. 

I'm ""slandering"" anyone anything. discussing situation using primarily citations Swedish sources experts. wish Sweden listen experts like Olsen switch better strategy (namely Test, Trace, Isolate) something *does* seem happening thankfully, albeit slowly many problems. ah, thats US isnt supporting I'd shocked. Congregate care settings massive percentage total deaths Northeast. Better practices nursing homes alone would spare huge percentage deaths, significant part average age younger. Thanks reply, right. flu symptoms, mom horrible State still suffered fatigue month after. I'll never pass boating school . attraction may cause shortness breath vomiting, part ride! correct response College graduates come significantly higher salaries non-college graduates. degree program school average starting salary $75,000, plus sign bonuses relocation packages. Boo fucking hoo ass. Seen people wearing neckloops, ear even covering nose, mouth..

Lets forget people dont push metal strip nose tightly. Thank listening :) That’s way see making sense he’s lax. 

I know respiratory therapist hospital (Long Island) super careful beginning eased haven’t many deaths passed 2 months. here. email school couple weeks ago effectively school open, masks optional. couple days later hang tight evaluating options. got update today saying online option, along person masks required. Thank heavens! considering moving schools one offering online option. Glad school came around. 3 million total amount cases since beginning. Past cases exactly impact hospitals present. Active cases 1.6 million. still scary number own... used bigger number purpose frighting headline. Mistake made lesson learned. Mistake still made. NYS keeping patient hospital hotel rooms empty. opinion send people hotels. state lock hard others much showing. wish NYS tell Rhode Island stop pulling people NYS health check. can't that. worried travelers. 19% - Americans asked Canadians said, ""Aye, mate!""

note:

yes, know ""Aye, mate!"" actually European... /s Sad games, sad prizes. still funds left PPP. small businesses qualified, would gotten loans. POTUS extreme religious ties, dgaf. free hide basement vaccine. rest us go living. slow DT want testing go? lethal anyone 65 bro. 

/s AZ....never way. start gofundme account family pay medical bills... extremely selective information push, though. seems coincide information would ""convenient,"" whether facts not. They, along organizations, pushed lot hand-washing disinfecting beginning. Easy, right? people wash hands spray bleach. know fomites major source infection COVID. facts back then, pushed hard anyway. researchers calling COVID airborne months, organizations totally ignored this. burden proof airborne transmission high compared burden proof fomite transmission? anything, think they'd want extra cautious. Plan entire year. guy American. Read fucking article. Russia ravaged COVID-19 yet? What's THAT?!? 🤔 Hell yes do. 4th July passed. Give 2-3 weeks. Trump announce 99.99% people Covid part Deep State hoax. know using population density show America greater disadvantage Canada. But, keep mind America South Korea discovered first COVID case *the day*. Korea 1/6th US population, 1/37th total area. far, far densely populated, handled virus quickly effectively.

Look towards Singapore even extreme example. Canada offering roughly well. Ok didn’t know common practice. figured try test many people possible rather people multiple times honest add back New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts numbers April, really much better all. looking today, looks like we'll hitting highest amount daily deaths since June 10th. good. Currently 993 deaths reported today per Worldmeters. shouldn’t right next other. get can’t wear mask running, therefore social distance instead. mentioned China mitigate feasible real world. China popular travel destination. time Wuhan cluster infections. natural assume countless numbers carriers around globe. 

If China declare H2H transmission one week earlier, wuhan could avoid many social gatherings lunar new year many lives China would saved.

US make much difference. think way US responded. US knows H2H transmission already 6 months still arguing masks. need one export case China multiply. country ever scale community spread US. US currently biggest exporter cases deporting immigrants home andnnow forcing F1 students leave country. huge increase pneumonia, that’s corona deaths got missed. Ya Americans love make argument everything fail lol Thanks details. quant though. I'm surprised isopropyl kill virus own. genuinely feel bad gym owners. lose everything situation.


I blame open now/ masks socialists crowd.

If gotten type control could re-opening now. see lawsuits future.

The medical agencies told people could dangerous. Mostly shops there. Much different Disneyland itself. Well article uses obtuse wording mean total cases. 

Compare worldometer see total case number Florida approx 213k matching numbers quoted positive tests article. number actually terrify them. Read thread ""lead time There's evidence inactivates flu vaccine may protective COVID too... guy American. Read fucking article. ""Horrific situation""

Yes that's easy say outsider. leave us alone. Oh yeah. strategy putting Covid folks elderly home fucking brilliant.   400 million year lot cash start organization US. proved mislead convey proper information appropriate time.  r/leopardsatemyface could good strategy overall harm reduction. many children per teacher? 

If service saves lives, does, essential service. Bus drivers driving essential. Nurses working essential. Grocery store workers also save lives. Essential work happen. Lol, probably let everyone else United States point would likely make numbers go since failing miserably compared rest world. 🤣 Lol comment took less 8 hours age poorly. We’re back nearly 1000 deaths today because, like literally every weekend, reporting drops weekend. Deepstate thing. never voted oust Bolsanaro provide funding rioters Hong Kong. solution needs comprehensive that. Hotel style quarantine works well things like close contacts known cases incoming international travellers, also need solution mild cases need high level hospital care (but need quarantine hotel). Keep mind majority COVID-19 cases fall category.

China filling public spaces like stadiums, convention centres etc beds man skeleton HCW crew. certainly luxurious hotel, laid optimise amount mild condition patients nurse keep eye on. aim provide space mild condition patients recover own, keep close watch case deteriorate require proper hospitalisation. cubicle hospitals also things like bottled oxygen, awaiting ambulance, sometimes even onsite CT available handle emergency situations might arise among patients.

I understand US actually made progress front field hospitals setup similarly, given current surge may good idea start deploying field hospitals widely take much load proper hospitals possible. funny act like debt actually fucking matters, proceed produce 2 trllion dollars fucking nowhere, straight steal 70% it. could fund free healthcare, education UBI every american citizen choose oligarchs 6th house 2nd yacht. Respect That's works. exactly mean that? Expound it, asshole. American sociologists philosophers predicted American individualism would downfall decades. keep mind said last month, lot changed last weeks. 

I wonder answer would different point. particular case individual profession. great mid levels lot experience make good decisions know they’re scope. incredible asset. gut probably one 3rd wave first one never left. one. Southern Republicans cannot vote November die coronavirus summer fall. strategy? It’s matter time. ICU’s full people can’t breathe. magic fixes here. ventilators ICU beds doesn’t mean people using magically saved.  all. already probably much closer seems since effort US report COVID deaths COVID avoided. There's awful lot people coincidentally dying pneumonia lately! crime humanity refuses prioritize testing. level testing done places (NYC Belgium) insignificant make CFR inapplicable today's level testing.

Belgium done 113,000 tests per million, US done 117,000 per million, significant difference 

Observed CFR US 4.3%, that’s plain fact, there’s little evidence radical change testing last month US, ratio positive tests doubling, one change see cases among younger people, “could” cut CFR 2% one wildly optimistic, that’s got 800 per day. think US like 45% nursing home deaths (last checked anyway).

And ultimately larger point comparing us vs canada (or really, countries other) limited usefulness myriad factors affect numbers individual country Balance billing fucking sucks America already contributing way China. Fat lot good did. referring effectiveness humans. actually clear intent OP read again. hope right also know almost certainly not. 

It’s odd feeling. Teachers going start dying. Students, too.

genocide roulette. Movie studios release new movies unless *huge* number theaters open, unless ding-dongs expect show old movies, SOL anyway.

Are convinced lot people want pay movie theater prices watch 10 year-old movie?   anybody know odds catching non-Covid-19 illness nowadays? problem testing—-said batshit Trump...if don’t test don’t COVID....so test cancer anymore cause makes cancer go away..../s....it’s like bad movie it’s comforting see dumbasses charge squirm  Ok, statistically bad decision. people financially emotionally fit kids late teenage years?

Tests determine whether virus system don’t count reported totals. new positives, repeat Actually maybe surprising, nudists (in experience) pretty good respecting boundaries. know cant wander public naked everyone would cool it. Like another redditer said : businesses employees rely tourism. lot hotels rely summer rush, they're really empty year. Medicaid. Marketplace plans. 

But fuck me. I’ve definitely free practically free insurance. 978 deaths reported today...the highest single-day total since June 10th.

Seems like deaths curve bottomed heading back now. say tested positive ""no chance"" infected others. Every infected person asymptomatic period time. way know infected anyone. also can't know certain one false negative. Yes, know small percent false negatives, mean happen. Biden wins, US go right back jump hoops? 11 yachts need cleaning god damn cleaners home taking care kids. Yes, depending people smart November sets important precedent won’t financially support corruption incompetence. consequences - wag finger keep writing checks nothing change.

Well, would taken precautions like everybody brain talking taking, would arrest people break quarantine.  Hmm... pediatricians make money sick injured kids? Something happens far less frequently school hmm... According local rumors, hackers keep taking servers, want release anything causes surge hacking. state?

Almost every single one troll comment histories filled anti-lockdown, hydroxychloroquine pumping, get-over-it happy talk. tested 11 million people (less 1% population) find 6 positives. done pooling little hundred tests.

Somebody president knows (or help win election) something w company. Book it. Someone know running group morning Houston running people doesn’t live without masks standing right next other. Clearly many people don’t care don’t get it. think anyone learned lesson. Think again. Daily count, mean 1 day period time. Also link goes Canada count research US. think Florida located map? 6*20 account probably rounding feel bad people terrible leadership. Epis great numbers. field people typically interviews whatnot. issue proper people training you. Someone works STDs normally interviews anyways would much suited help interviewing techniques elicitation. ""lOwEsT dEaTh RaTe wOrLd"" original comment implied don’t surge capacity like NY crisis. stating likely capacity states needed.

Let make clear, saying good idea use fallback plan reason say fuck regards public health. I’m conservative support hell Lincoln project right now. Releasing children physically back school middle pandemic like releasing herd cats small locked room. going end well. Probably weekend holiday backlog. Let’s see tomorrow’s numbers getting scared. coworker tested last monday. 8 days ago. work every day open since that. still results. Ain’t sad, sad truth... Grifting away... It’s incredibly sad. saying isn’t. Bye, Georgia. think starting next week we'll see death spike again. Hey now, let’s rush judgement 927 people feel better included weekend count percentage download counters generally by? experience many would legitimate given number type app? Also, many would illegitimate app ineffective? It’s incredibly sad either way. Accelerate curve what’s alternative? keep throwing good money bad support hopelessly corrupt organization? already contributing way China managed co-opt anyway. Everyone complains wrong move never offers viable alternative solution “just fix somehow.” someone another thread said, get ready new round talking points isn’t big deal.

Stay safe friends. Don’t get careless masks distancing. know it’s said lot, but... fuck police. Sacrificed alter stupidity. fucking idiot side world, im China, enrolled one semester Jilin University, allow help visa extention. still finished studies, offering 6 month visa extention (because low non existing flights moment), dont get stuck god knows where, paying thousands dollars plane ticket. Bro, I’ve myself. worse yet come aint truth  Things always bigger Texas world e-sports, Faze Clan received loan worth $1 million-$2 million. Fandango competitor Atom Tickets also took $1 million-$2 million loan. TCL Chinese Theatre received loan $350,000 $1 million, Sean ""Diddy"" Combs' TV channel, Revolt, got $1 million $2 million.

OK new plan. ADA requires reasonable accommodation - I'm sure many doctors consider include keeping children school setting webcam classroom digital portal homework submission reasonable accommodation, would willing write letter effect. Mmmmm. Oven food. Corruption finest. loans supposed small business ONLY. Instead Trumpf laundered money put wanted need way, way, god king right. wonder want kids go back hmm... almost pediatricians make money sick injured kids... 
Also, school's plan horrifies sounds similar new curriculum well. Hoping government actually comes reasonable plan based actions previously think that's gonna happen. Fym schools session rn, last months school. People handled kids, like every single summer lol. Better hospitals overflow He’ll lie say vaccination ready mass production September/October Hope includes weekend count. Otherwise it’s incredibly sad.

Edit - it’s tragic either way. hope numbers don’t go back before. state India that. can’t spell begins G (gawali?). sure fucking hope quarantine repeatedly test offenders send hospital. That's true. Unfortunate indeed. opposed am, PPP loan also available churches due employees still pay state federal taxes.  employees churches employees churches allowed apply loans supposed used payroll. Thank saying that. matter age health condition, die alone without chance say goodbye family heartbreaking, heartbreaking family unable proper funeral. Bold think registers embarrassment Florida. know, feels terrible. Thank do. check CDC website. check yearly averages compared counts year find discrepancies

But that's enough.. That's model excess mortality. account seasonality all? Yeah can’t compel anyone anything here. understand talking wasn’t case Like supposed though? contributed way China ever still co-opted anyway. organization clearly rife corruption throwing good money bad obviously going fix it. I’d rather fix problem rather abandon altogether, frankly don’t see done since US direct authority WHO. 100% move redneck backwater. commenting OPs comments drawing “excess capacity” like “NY”. saying it’s good idea saying still capacity rest country needed help surge 4 states Party Heather's!!!

It’s hard say everyone’s career different retired E5 probably medically retired. OIF1 2 probably saw combat retirement rank isn’t unheard of. beautiful likely related nicotine. allowed lawmakers dense  Full swabs 80% accurate best, nasal swabs less accurate people lower viral load, see possible, try get tested 3rd day get symptoms, act like might infectious even test negative. 

Timeline: 

Day 0: Exposure.

Day 1: 100% false negatives get test.

Day 2: people start become infectious.

Day 4-5: 67% risk false negatives, people symptoms onset, infectiousness peaks.

Day 8: Test accuracy peak 3 days post symptom onset, false negative risk falls 20% (this good tests get), mean get tested 8 days exposure, vary people different incubation period. best result, wait 3 days symptom onset, go date exposure.

Day 14: Incubation period effectively over, 99.5% people would symptom onset now.

The window infectiousness opens 2 days exposure close 11-19 days later, depending research read. Infectiousness peak day symptom onset day symptom onset. data mostly based people develop symptoms clear holds true people remain asymptomatic entire infection. 

Source: False negative timeline: /r/COVID19/comments/gjgst2/variation_in_falsenegative_rate_of_reverse/

I mean .. 1.3 million recovered Covid cases there. think significant number suffering serious damage? kind evidence people? Thank God PA mail voting. primary, way out.  Population density You’re optimistic government accountability responses.  Yeah know, congratulating y'all. I'm Chicago so, problem. brought I'm expecting stay down, unfortunately. still amazing did. Look winning!  /s  He’s 80?? Damn, never would guessed. “these elderly frail would’ve died within year”. 

I’ve heard one several times. Wow... completely different Tennessee. Employees even wearing masks let alone customers. finally mandating every employer must require employees wear mask, always add caveat like. 'All employees must wear mask...however cases socially distance dont to.' yeah kinda figured this...... Canada let doctors manage epidemic, politicians cheer leading. see lot people assume cold chins, cause that's masks covering. Schrodinger's virus: biochemical weapon China, hoax China. City Phoenix requested Federal help. FEMA refused. works believe exceptional. know started long before, surprise believed manifest destiny often calvinist shit turning MADLIBS

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ (state) reports biggest one-day increase \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ (deaths) (cases) (hospitalizations) (% positives) ....etc Maybe try looking data, even thread:  69% go herd immunity /s Thnx pops. Got respect Xers too. first get fucked Boomers. agree, friend. politician. thing knows do. virus. since IQ owl pellet, neither knows head-on collision course other, full speed ahead. hes one asshole see movies think money solve everything..... Sounds right. like actively trying better Covid-19. Lol Good point, least going forward. lawsuits may merit sued paid tuition expecting receive person teaching Spring 2020 got online classes instead without discount refund sort offered. Better PCR bud US death toll track break 1 thousand daily again... Slate.com catches Wuhan februrary Stop terrified. It’s 99% survival rate. live life freely. mother stepfather healthcare professionals. gave antibiotic try ward virus. Then, treated home oxygen hydroxychloroqyine. Eventually took hospital initially declined intubate. 

She cancer survivor. many medical issues. parents took large church gathering. needed protected parents. hope investigation death. hard find is. gotta sequence virus infection whatever 2nd positive test result is. Insurance borderline unaffordable without employer sponsored though. income parents supposed pay it? mean getting dowvoted that's absolutely part increase, came 3 day Holliday weekend suspiciously low reported numbers.

So far total number deaths 7 day period ending today still lower previous week's count. expect see actual increase soon, really increase yet. talking like it’s over. resident risk isn’t gone. True success determined manage keep numbers despite reopening. require personal responsibility. far good wouldn’t speak virus past tense. long way go still.

That said proud state. Let’s keep up. Reporting last 4 days? Technically ended. Tomorrow we'll back 1-day totals. Yeah ""Freedum!""... That’s easy - people die heart disease cancer every year. lets get away 300-400 thousand deaths still claim victory.

The last resort “hey hadn’t blocked flights Gina 2 million people would died”. That’s tougher sell admits virus serious. Lol economy tourism dead almost everyone works american western european turkey neck. florida texas dont inrease deaths... texas like 20 deaths yesterday. 2 months ago Everyone's got camera.  love you’re right yet downvoted. According study covering 118 low- middle-income countries Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School Public Health, **an additional 1.2 million under-five deaths** could occur six months due reductions routine health service coverage levels increase child wasting.

This grim. I'd fuck first-world grandmas, need open everything up. can't count past 10. didn’t mention 4 years undergrad since it’s shared physicians mid level providers. It’s also relevant actual medical care since don’t start learning stuff postgraduate anyways 

I speaking strictly post graduate work They’re predestination. Creepy fucks. well, controlled begin so....why hell back lying shit?  Well, according worldometers, we've almost 950 deaths today. seems numbers starting rise too. talking point generally correct, though accurate say things near plateau now. 

Today due backlogged reporting long weekend, due spike deaths single day. you....agree me? Maybe people little afraid nearly many infections deaths seeing now. That’s death rate 0.5% 

Yes math correct 

It correct checked twice 

That means 99.5% percent people survived.

Why need wear masks again... Catalonia hit harder every region exception Madrid. Well, guess we'll see many children die this. US peaked 250,000 transmissions day according IHME US much smaller population. Good god. That’s sobering thought. fucking stupid. two powerful nations humanity ever built essentially chimps slinging shit other. Also QC. barely hold province. Please stay away, America.

ACCES INTERDIT say want, change politics lol. I'm fiscally conservative socially moderate. think defund police think president uniting less divisive racial matters. ok peaceful protestors condemn rioting looting. support taking confederate monuments defacing Lincoln monument Ulysses S. Grant. 

Also, perfect world without COVID, supporter low taxes general. agree deficit spending. definition makes fiscal conservative social moderate. did! actually martial arts entire childhood... so... meeting? I'm sensing wide spread feeling... Completely makes sense. Thank you. hide numbers, won’t able hide bodies cremations.  think serious. want specific numbers serious young people. percentage young people teat positive hospitalized. That's I'm asking. Agreed. I’m okay people coming home quarantine moving around within community. I’m okay people summer vacationing 500m house though. Since city took beach parking away tourists parking neighbourhood (permit know). It’s ridiculous. Worldmeter spread day happened. Several trackers - Cali's Monday's numbers 6 7 range. Dude, Americans (even pandemic) pay $500 emergency. think American justice system rife inequities, delusional. None totally absolute, nothing impacted them. Read story Brock Turner trial. Mission accomplished! I’m Canada, dad surgery Florida (not covid related). scared death him. least sister too, makes worried well :(

Stay safe there! wish optimism probably people think they're immune.  virus caused .3% excess deaths NYC, 20% testing positive.  Given .3% Americans died WW2, boggles mind think it’s big deal. Maybe it’s kills old people. “screw grandma” may sound fine Republican knitting circle, that’s people consciences think.

Most estimates lethality exceed .5%

That’s least 1 million dead Americans isn’t contained.

And yet America can’t afford lockdown.  Italy can? Spain can!?!? C’mon, even serious? amazing lengths people go order downplay virus. And/or blood clotting issues disrupting circulation brain, and/or immune system causing damage trying destroy virus, and/or developing auto-antibodies process. 

There several mechanisms, none good. article give data. says effects ages tell much. Also wanted make sacrifice please Orange Overlord.  reason test vaccines 12-18 months human trials catch side effects.

Nope, heavily regulated hard get volunteers,etc. 6 months trial run perfectly OK. vaccine 2 year side effect? 18 months trial still catch it. Happens every year flu /s South Carolina 1500 reported cases sixth population Texas comes rate, don’t hear We're still first wave too.  Good times.  Good times. certain president, hard-pressed tell difference. sit watching Shudder *right now!*  sear making everyone state watching videos 10 hours straight long lines hospitals people dying streets line hospitals would wake everyone up. 

People fucking idea coming. get takeout go outside park eat it. still get outside eating good eats. I've done picnics past months good change pace. Oh recognize right. hope rubes vote Republican don’t realize it. Yes, usually teachers make people smarter, smart kids easy blindly lead however politician wants Yes, parties regulate parties. Kinda like oversight. work together sometimes. saw deaths Wednesday Tuesday 7 day stretch basically flat previous 7 days. right now, fewer deaths USA time last year could due lot ppl staying home instead engaging riskier activities, definitely interesting. Terrible. What's even shocking barely higher US right now, adjusted per capita. Yes, Fauci made mistake case.

In fact Anthony Fauci's specialty, infectious respiratory, immune system research (rheumatology) well AIDS!

Robert Redfield, specializing virology, specialist respiratory diseases, specialty also AIDS. fact nominated Trump important fact he's head CDC.

And know AIDS sexually transmitted blood, threshold transmission high

In fact Robert Redfield one taking responsibility, hardly see anyone accusing that, NIH, Fauci based, medical behavioral research institute, responsible disease prevention control.

&amp;#x200B;

Sure, know average person, US clearly needs leading expert respiratory disease anything else, person needs understand public health policy too!

&amp;#x200B;

But America needs anything else, surely, new president.

From Good.

Make example others same. Unreal. Per capita. Percentage positive. That's always data mattered. Antecdotes always completely useless. stance since day 1. example, 36 states increasing percentage positive tests concerning me. 40 states increasing totals useful date automatically testing numbers, however percentage positive clears clear way. thing expecting different results.”  Damn, right stay close!! want COVID cases here, enough deal already. Deaths road rage incidents pale comparison coronavirus deaths USA.  Seems social workers would fit mask enforcement squad perfectly. see what's funny Don’t forget 10s thousands protesting. said, ""NEXT, SOMEONE GOING SAY YOUNG PEOPLE SPREADING VIRUS OLD PEOPLE."" experience no. multiple patients die pneumonia oxygen levels read 94 percent so. pulse oximeter wont help much.

Because covid-19's nasty stealth hypoxia trait, purchased pulse oximeter. spoke doctor pulse oximeters. said I'm symptoms without shortness breath pulseox reading 95, call immediately. asthma auto-immune diagnoses, considers anything 95 emergency.

Organs starved oxygen force body work harder survive weaker state.

If get virus despite taking every precaution pulse oximeter allows get help become fully hypoxic, worth every penny.  He’s busy sucking trumps small orange chode dick Trump why.  Politic why.  It’s god damn pandemic. Grow GOP Lungs may heal still going scar tissue cause complications later.  virus long term implications anyone gets it.  ""Florida Man Dies Injecting Lysol"" Thanks hard work sharing experience average least one die, cool party. Get pulse ox. MIL (confirmed positive) typical symptoms 10 days, fine 2 days, day 12 checked oxygen routine (she hadnt symptoms 2 days still hasnt week later) got reading 84. booked hospital told come day would woken next day. hasnt needed ventilator ICU care hooked oxygen 24/7 today day 19. forget thermometer, monitor oxygen levels next several weeks even symptoms subside 👍🤛 Getting REEAL sick tired people thinking God gives shit survives virus doesn’t... Ever see movie awakenings? based epidemic believe. LPT: Citing random person calling nurse Reddit karma killer. American here, totally agree. Keep borders closed. Diaper Don's latest tweet says deaths tenfold.....I wish making Im one family, friends, economic impact. Suddenly threat Covid becomes economic issue. dont think people see that. snowballs.  conservative numbers fair. height italy mortality rate damn near 5.3%. take number lets say close 2200 day. dude thats still lot fucked say soldier, it’s considered (rightfully) disrespectful. However, least soldiers *do know accept* risks. It’s secret soldiers die. 

How fuck people think applies bartenders nurses?! happens containment:

* 287,000 cases per day India
* 95,000 cases per day America

Pretty much proportion population. interesting thing think about. cynic makes suspect every country earth currently fighting within systems downplay virus much possible without exposed. obviously countries suited others. might able sort differentiate take-out vs. dine-in tipping. know much tipped tip included initial pre-authorization card first swiped restaurant, people usually tip less take-out dine in, might threshold tipping amount decide whether consider take-out dine-in. Ugh, thumbnail looks like venom inject brain  Likewise. surprise countries closing borders Americans since administration done screwed royally. Ticketmaster StubHub still good though. news bankruptcies. Hmmmmm... Agreed, we're idiots. wouldn't? Untrue, people Alberta don’t want visitors either. Source: Albertan. also fuck holds sandwich one hand drink another? We’d fucked even proper leadership point. nothing compared gonna 3-4 weeks. speak rest Canada, may 30th, Québec's excess mortality 4335 deaths official Covid-19 death-toll 4562, Covid deaths excess mortality.

I much doubt situation changed since, considering deaths slowed trickle we're registering &lt;100 cases day time now.

EDIT: Phrasing 
EDIT (2): Source : (It's French maybe online translator good enough job) seriously depressing-ass headline. think asking US learn China's experience, would benefit US itself, bad US? oh yeah hospitals make sooo much money treating fake virus invented make money actually treating. Biden extreme left though. Biden center anything honest. I’m sorry ask this, reality gotten f-ed can’t tell difference jokes real stories anymore: people actually licking toilet seats? 99% harmless!

Dude aligns far political chart anything creates enough controversy move agenda's next issue we're still ruefully pissed did. I'm ordinarily open, compassionate, accepting person makes effort prejudiced. However, extremely prejudiced Americans travelling America right now. already lived here, that's absolutely fine, long quarantine appropriate. urgent important business sort quarantine appropriately, that's fine, too. fun visit, perhaps family group friends, please go away come near workplace. America's infection rate unknown control want unknowing carriers coming impacting health care systems, especially we've working hard practice distancing. country can't good position help guys future we're expending resources fighting infection longer could have. 19% Canadians think open!?!? American pretrump used good thing. don’t blame Canada 
I'm using 7-day average both, could grabbed wrong figure examples.

I think deaths go near future, pattern deaths cases kinda inconsistent due testing situation. point put lot attention hospitalizations positivity rate. build dam. Let's put combed beavers this. That's probably quite bit higher really Canada - Quebec extremely conservative reporting recoveries, they're still reporting 25K active cases even though would include every case since beginning May. They've 5K cases last five weeks.

[This estimates Quebec recoveries match patterns seen elsewhere winds around 5K active cases Canada, goes pretty well 550 currently hospitalized. truth probably middle, I'd dearly love believe smaller number sanity.

Mind you, I'd hope something similar going States. want think 1.6 million cases active anywhere. American, think counties definitely protect citizens closing borders Americans. country can't get crap together take care fellow Americans definitely care country. here, close safety. Bc know reinfect day 1 open Things stabilizing according Governor DeSantis FL... mean, lying right? firing record keeper fudging numbers....no.... data right damage perm. know known since March. Michigan sisters, mom, friends tested past days (Saturday yesterday). Results taking anywhere 24hrs three days. Sadly, agree. Colleges money maker, one gives fuck education. know people want hear this, US less ego (both leader media, people) taken seriously towards events China Jan. Feb., including lockdown, testing, new hospitals, mandatory masks, things definitely gonna lot different now. Hasn’t caught break career Hi BC person! French fries Yes!  I'm gonna take guess say Alberta don’t know tell you. main site 10,000 well. I’m guessing it’s delayed little bit.  fully agree outlook. Still much still love you, Canada. need stay safe. Someone doesn’t understand exponential growth. Without lockdown, grows exponentially. Germany seeing limited growth significant non-pharmaceutical interventions. can’t 50k new infections per day. actually due razor thin advantage Hillary suburbs swing states  lot Asians appear successful stereotype H1-B visas skewing types Asian immigrants allowed USA. cousins going engineering careers student visas got degree? problem coming US . retired aunts uncles who've trying escape Hong Kong past decade saw writing wall 1997? Still can't come US stuck paperwork hell. segregate immigrate, going skewed perception demographic. 

Being largely STEM mean we're better either. contend bamboo ceiling. less Asians middle-upper management C-teams minorities despite apparent over-representation tech. Many us max career paths lower level positions racist perception we're good little drones leadership ability. also encourage/prioritize asthma patients get flu shot. ok. we're done here. got enough information. shut everybody! Well math .5% Texas’s population could catch highly contagious disease still yet learn everything about. Sorry Canadians, royally screwed absolutely let Americans get shit together I'm already armed teeth case. 🤷🏻‍♂️ someone loves Montana agree more... yet meet american feels Canada keep borders open. would situation reversed. know. jail outbreaks really bad Source? dumb shits makes Florida like fun house mirror fail. endless loop lunacy. done executive order Governor. would simple justify given circumstances. I’m old 😂

You both. Time marches us ... others ahead behind us... friends Asian? Asian? aren't, can't speak Asian community Argentina like can't Brazil. are, must realize can't speak every Asian person country, like can't speak every Black person mine. 

I agree, rest world like US, can't assume happen live happen you. PPP goes paying workers, company rent utilities.  Everything else loan.  

I care super rich pukes like Kanye get money using pay workers instead laying firing them. Welcome Earth! 
It's sorta like since humans came along.
I'm disappointed too. Cause I’m essential worker important need out. Look really cool shit back dont wanna share. using cases day, 7-day average? think avg 6/30 example 34k deaths 43k.

The death rate definitely gone March-May period, that's testing bad hitting vulnerable demographic.

Testing still bad now, certainly better. Recently trend converge towards 1.8-2.0% range.

On 6/25 example ~1.8%, shot bit hovered around 2.8%, creeping 2% again.

It could certainly go lower, ICUs maxing makes nervous quality care. article clear misinformation. That's report button for. remember crazy sub Wuh4n* _Flu serious sub. (I try edit name apparently sub list words get comment auto-removed).

Then 2 subs intentionally swapped focus posting standards. Holy crap graph article logarithmic scale still looks scary hell.

Two months ago sub packed Indians touting well country shutting Covid-19. think even naysayers thougjt would turn quickly. way die logged pneumonia death didn’t get tested. Source? think you’re onto something, think little nuance that. confounds me. people refuse wear masks altruistic (your second bullet), would anything protect help strangers need, families, local community needed (altruism “local” level)? say I’ve found lot people US lot like that. helpful, kind people around 1:1 small scale basis also least concerned society large seems comes responding virus. simply come small scale tribalism combined flat-out mistrust governmental guidance due indoctrinated individualism? I’m really curious psychological reasons created current dynamic behavior.  also mean Canadians stay America? Would love visit Maine without running Frenchy Acadian bastards many idiots live country? Yes. Seems like exception, norm. nurses drs back? lent ethical, need back. Arizona put bottom CA’s concerns, problems people aren’t acting dumb. /r/LeopardsAteMyFace might count legal oath charge Perjury quarantine like testified writing would. also / test people. common sense long term consequences many.

Why ""Just common sense""?

What evidence would support common sense? find hard form lasting, meaningful relationships? true everyone gets infected? probability infected person truly asymptomatic, zero organ damage? That's perfect recipe global wars. 

Although American world order resented many, (was?) relatively peaceful compared multipolar precedents. Think Europe pre-1945, millions died direct result warfare. many people died wars US global hegemon? Orders magnitude less. 

Don't get wrong. I'm jerking US. think Chinese hegemonic order equally ""peaceful,"" least compared world many evenly matched powers vying supremacy. 

China would even resented today, that's par course global leader. 4 deaths one many IMO

So 3 deaths fine? Canadian would mad bunch Americans came starting spread virus. sure that? Deaths reported weekend pretty similar numbers prior weekend website use.

If don't, rebel freethinker. piece shit :) /u/cryptolies spammer, karma farmer, bad faith troll. attempt engage good faith discussion waste time. Downvote, report comments mods, report profile admins spam. 2020's total deaths, minus 5 year average deaths = pretty damn good guess many died. would cancel fair? want catastrophic numbers would produce? China invented vaccine prevent infectious disease? Chin could done more. crying baby.

China definitely done enough.

1. Thousands mysterious pneumonia every year, China quick lucky detect small cluster 41 cases late Dec released virus gene sequence week.
2. courage lock entire 10M mega city unprecedently executed lockdown strictly.
3. Build hospital week
4. Test 10 million people 10 days. Wow madness. darkness fast approaching. also time year get allergies help, I'll give thermometer shot  ... ""pneumonia"" deaths like 5000 ... look ratio cases deaths. possible deaths low. ridiculous lying.

Texas absolute embarrassment US. Abbott needs resign. important comment. 900 people didn’t die today, died course days weren’t counted today holiday.  
 
That may seem like pointless distinction talking body count, matters trying distinguish overall trend. Financially. again, standards don’t apply pandemic American I’m 81% keep closed get shit together. effective post inauguration still time prevent it. vote. lot people attacking Florida Texas Arizona R states. one talking California it’s state. states required accept? Seems like Arizona’s asking trouble, states risk infected patients? 

I know covid patients flouted guidelines mocked seriousness, fuck, Arizona, yourself. *Samuel L. Jackson chomping cigarette*: ""Hold butts."" I'm Alabama. Send help. really sad comments like would need /s half Reddit, there's legitimately political leaders Republican party blaming Obama. seven day average tick today’s numbers Yes.

Girl susceptible disease goes disease party catches disease, couldve seen one comin forgot 9 activity: Living TX, AZ FL. think that’s insult actual scum. Well wouldn’t get many clicks would semi good news. people like doom gloom scenarios miserable want everyone else too. optimism shot down, I’m guessing collecting 600 covid bucks want continue knows. think pandemic starting expose lot holes general principles fiscal conservatism. Like 5 months ago, would said I'm reading people leaving hospitals 6 figure bills due COVID, kind makes feel bad supportive it. 

So, normal circumstances clearly extraordinary circumstance high unemployment public health crisis. can't really make judgement I've ceded ground subject sure. 

As fiscal conservative though, like oversight PPP we're increasing taxes match increased deficit spending. whole ordeal special scenario usual times, Im proponent low taxes running national debt. Orange county looked *The Economist*'s data recorded deaths 2020, expected deaths based previous years average recorded Covid-related deaths. Eyeballing (because crunch numbers), there's something around 5-10k deaths average attributed Covid. sucks, honestly thought discrepancy would flagrant that. one convincing hoax, huh guys!? slow game. January saying spread human human. Next month report COVID dangerous elderly infirm. Yah, everyone stuck home. cattle going wild orgies. would orange county, reported 1000, 2 days row Trump: ""we try nuking hurricanes stop them""

Aides: ""Uh. Mr President, corona virus kill people hurricanes have.""

Trump: ""Get launch codes."" focus getting virus control first? Hospitals nearing capacity ordering schools open month? Might well come say give fuck citizens. talking point meant sustain next talking point. never good faith. Yep. I’m called paranoid coworkers ask what’s mask. think say why. pretty obvious anyone paying attention. Lysol disinfectant Maxcover follow active ingredients: alkyl (50% C14, 40% C12, 10%C16) dimethyl benzoyl ammonium saccharinate- 0.10% 
Ethanol - 58%

Go find it’s equivalent! point it’s silly argue people this. Everyone made choice think aren’t going change minds admit wrong matter wrong look. don’t understand let happen? people held hostage like this, it’s ridiculous. Well least paying bill now. Let china pay puppets. Cities counties creations state. independent authority. Oh, I'm sure they'll get it. Newsome reimpose lockdown? many people infected realize control? Look Saturday vs. last. higher count today making deaths missed Saturday holiday. real question 7 day average higher Friday. Looks like no. Still early make assumptions others said, need look deaths Wed-Fri understand increasing not.

Protip- never look single day's deaths determine increasing decreasing. stupid leading blind. Ok guys, sue president? Congress? Oh texas governor? would interesting see often hospitals full ICUs COVID compare. mom cancer year ago, go ER many times complications. Several times wait admitted sometimes 24 hours ER Neuro ICU dept full. well COVID. Atleast people got freedumb 😔 😮 It’s Trump came early called Democrat media hoax refuses acknowledge severity it. 
So propaganda media outlets like foxnews ran right wing leaning people think it’s big deal. right wing governors wanted show allegiance mirroring rhetoric refusing close opening early. 
It’s like weapons mass destruction. First right wing line Iraq involved 9/11 wanted attack US wmds, bent attacking US wmds, knew wmds somewhere. settled “well saddam terrible ruler anyway.” course late. damage done. won’t different. don’t need hand felonies this. Dear god hungry shit. Mentally ill? Coronavirus killed 5x many people car accidents year it’s done 6 months. I'm saying is, kids go school could bring home virus parents, live. kids grandparents living home. could spread them. teachers could get well. Stay salty couple years this... mostly backlog, even taking consideration still slight uptick. would mark first time two consecutive days increases quite long time. Still enough declare upward trend, case building. nearly 1,000 although could 4th July. Tomorrow's figure give better picture deaths heading New one saw multiple positives person counted multiple times vs once. 

Also guy today told ""but hey point, Arizona residents higher risk dying COVID 19 struck lightning. SMALL margin hey going argument. ""

I quickly linked NOAA fact page lightning entire US. 270 people stuck lightning per year. 27 die. even close. 

There's also people take number deaths particular day think dividing entire state population production really low number calculator makes things better. Young people spreading virus old people. 🍻 That’s suggestion. what’s answer? think proved point: add deaths holiday weekend, it’s well average. include large number today, brings 7 day average line they’ve seeing.  
 
We knew would case today. catching-up may continue next days well, difference reporting policies state. Taking ass served adaptive response one find many immigrants have. It’s understandable context, serving needs future generations beyond survival mode (and see materialistic success part this, it’s still focused Maslow’s lower needs). Contexts change adaptive maladaptive changes. 

FWIW Asian mom taught life unfair imperfect, mean better world worth fighting for. think things changing regarding stereotyped timidity. EXACTLY. excuse. I'm sure South Koreans surprised learn live dictatorship. Think smartass directions. Like one hand one wants diseased hoard covid lepers. hand, fuck wants go cold boring Canada anyway? can't get Florida winter see lots wailing gnashing teeth ""GTA"" need taught grade 1 like social studies. look infection rate.

Kids going school OUTSIDE, inside packed classrooms. article NY Times back people stigmatized COVID. healthcare workers refused service certain places. One person said neighbors longer speak told COVID. 

In city, seen people trying go witch hunts find covid. scary. People insane days. epi super biased tend agree. I've worked great clinicians, I've worked never taught think outside bubble. Especially nurses seems, struggle recognize issues issue hitting hospital particular.

Especially institution based education, would pretty moronic ignore expert advice.  realized pandemic playbook needed picture book. attach smoke? virus contained according ""president"" =/ together Obamacare aka ACA?  Yeah, think people refusing listen science experts huge part problem. would nice could chill fuck Karen'ing wear mask, are.... 

I disagree sending kids back school little ones can't trusted keep mask on, touch go near other. may work older kids damn sure going work younger ones.

Hahaaa dreading living fraternity house next year Honestly didnt ask. internal response stuck 'seriously?'. mean symptoms bad off. go work risk infecting entire office, send kids daycare take risk, take week sick leave unpaid every time get head cold? Slow testing leads less effective quarantine cases...

Not mention supposed ultrasound 2 days. OB wont see without negative test. I'm high risk get US every 2 weeks. end 2018, approximately 37.9 million people worldwide living HIV. year, 770,000 people died HIV-related causes 1.7 million people newly infected.

Looking america right now. think that's really good thing! potential autocracy human rights violations, none anti science. day day, world begin realise america like countries, beating protestors, banning foreign social media, espionage rivals allies alike. get idea die vine. Corona kill instantly, deaths always lag surge. braindead get that. Couldn’t agree dude. Covid-19 hoax?

The state still 6% positive cases though, think good sign. Well never pretend correct estimate, admitted eyeballing raw data (split state, week makes hell lot harder make sense without crunching numbers).

Thanks link tho. wondering cuz I’ve getting lot random calls lately never leave voicemails. yeah linked showed covid deaths underreported around 20%.. nearly entirely driven NY/NJ/IL/etc..

Yes, mandatory mask policy absolutely apply everyone else. work tv. Absolutely right I'd bet Apatow less 20 full time employees, maybe even less 10. vast majority production companies small without constant contracts make content, can't really afford keep skeleton crew payroll. can’t serious. bot dissenter. Wear masks class, hard? people fried chicken place street thing 8 hours day. 7 days business days? got tested last Wednesday technically tomorrow day 4. I'd wait next Monday 13 days test business days. First want us use contraception, want everyone die, need really make mind. Well, common sense tell 3 weeks 4th seeing know many days week long takes victims get sick enough go doctor/hospital. replay mother’s day Memorial Day greater scale. take people’s immediate family members make people take seriously.   Ah, bad, misread illegal prescribe family members. examine patient legally speaking document legal reason can’t prescribe needed medications family member it’s controlled substance.

The problem treating family people tend think family members going better reality situation caring family members causes lot people ignore serious diagnoses. That’s it’s discouraged medical bodies legal issue.

These people negligent prescribing, they’re negligent took kid covid party history cancer. makes absolutely sense. 

Also, wear one fucking glove? Keep closed exact numbers us, exact fewer cases. 

IMO, border staying closed another year least. Thank ally. Sit butt watch tv like goody two shoes! True, unfortunately colossal fear planes that’s kinda ruled out. common cold causing coronavirus reinfect readily. Dang!! pic lung look solid rock!!😱 mom keeps asking I'm gonna visit Florida.

And salmon taco's rooftop bar 4th July. Masks table. Staff masked. Sanitized check pen signature. Sanitizer everywhere. People lonely sad lucrative service industry jobs disappearing. Cambridge, people safe. That's unconstitutional law, possible enforce. QUESTION: reading MSN article today CDC counting anti-body tests count COVID tests. also counting person testing positive 3 times 3 cases? employer requires multiple negative tests returning work, type policy would really change one guilty parties headline. vocal case counts rising, don’t associated death toll 19 days out... (mean time contraction death) ... cases less deaths, may serious say. never possible unless high thinking it.  Sorry, America first world nation. Look list countries worst covid rates... India, Brazil, America. That's America lies relation rest world terms standard living government capability.  Awesome stereotype got there. We’re fixin find another 6 months. Saturday ~250 deaths lower typical. Take get bit higher last weeks numbers. worried food supply chain first, thought we'd okay. I'm freaking again. Superspreader year award goes to....

Oh yea, never. deaths low: ""See! even bad!""

When deaths high: ""The numbers overblown fake scare people!"" bureaucracy Hopefully “mostly free” means hes getting PHAT bonus end types view wearing mask fear per se much acknowledging reality covid 19 ""fear"" deniers. Besides obvious questions like, ""if healthcare workers can't even get masks, schools it?"", ""what happens teachers get sick subs start get sick?"", ""how shut sections school student may contact still function?"", etc... etc... expect teachers keep students socially distanced? high school, two classes 50 students room barely fit 25. distinctly remember sitting floor work. eventually moved us gym coaches complained returned classroom. think teachers actually able tell student wear mask? even wear ID. joke. spitting face teachers, janitors, others underpaid absolutely appreciated. Huh? Stabilized exponential direction California call dibs New York nurses We're gonna go back 9/11s everyday weeks could even twice that. bet reaction still same. inalienable Rights Freedoms citizens important single person.

People willing give freedoms soon living tyranny way god dammit.... forgotten that.

shit.....  saddest timeline. Fuck. American, think would best thing Believing democracy mean respect president who’s COVID-19 response basically downplay make governors heavy lifting undermining states trying take appropriate measures. flu kill two months later? Yeah I'm American upvoting shit comments think stay too. white men still refuse wear masks yell store employees ""go back China"". 

Sons *European* *~~bitches~~* *immigrants* entitled. Perhaps permanently. r/technicallythetruth  idiots glorify man continue so....you think changes anything? Kanye always Kanye sad. lot people realize mistake they're making late. No, don't. remember though said 60,000. Trump says coronavirus 'eradicated' US death toll passes 60,000 ... see Nah Americans There’s Trident commercial explains 4 5 dentists agree. Maybe it’s something like that? Yes... residents/locals super careful despite tourists visitors pretty brazen. know one group hositpals numbers true representation whole pandemic. even know sample size, decided scan people . heard damage permenant cases, I've heard know yet might permanent. know, I've heard lot talks mental wellness face extroverts socially distance quarantine, think hard people screaming reopen taken lockdown orders.

What really heard talking mental wellness people followed health recommendation dutifully done hard work, yet seeing hard work undone douche canoes.

Feel like need venting system types people. Something like ""I WANTED SEE FUCKING SIGNIFICANT CANADA, DUE PAINT CHIP EATING SONS WITCHES, WHOLE WORLD THINKS WE'RE BIO-HAZARDOUS NOW. WE'RE GOING PRAY VACCINE COMES EFFECTIVE OTHERWISE NEVER SEE PERSON AGAIN. EAT INFINITE BAG ****s.""

I feel like would help, y'know. South Korea known done extensive testing tracing asymptomatic people. wonder they've keeping tabs post-infection situation. Canadian, I'm disappointed 19% polled. people wearing masks like Trump gotten already? muslim? lol Remember said would go 15 0? Also loses election, 76 days even fewer constraints. That's pretty high ration new deaths new cases. shortage testing going Mexico? 56k insane. around 40-50 day Korea people freaking out, wonder people states reacting become numb it. I’m numb numbers point. Halfway post suddenly occurred counting human beings dying hundreds every single day. one unique life.

[Yes, considered Applebee's welcoming also probably gap symptoms showing entering hospital? Also believe longer stay hospital greater chance death well thanks explanation didnt know reference. fuck source? It’s nothing words doesn’t specify university- says UW. Seems like click bait bogus story. it’s real, use credible news source. relief hear Trumps sage wisdom topic knows well “what’s 19 even mean?” already show protests main cause uptick cases? “If video meetings opening schools up, shouldn’t be.”

As teacher something every educator’s mind. word yet (PA) don’t expect decision mid-August. tried quit multiple times, succeeded years time. always missed cigarettes wanted people blow smoke bars. Eventually relapsed. 

Five six years ago, got pneumonia could even get last puff down. could smoke sick went weeks without cigarette choice matter. 

What bizarre time abruptly interest cigarettes whatsoever. bagful cartons front closet years could’ve smoked anytime, thought longer occurred me. like never smoked all. interest. nostalgia. nic fits. Nothing. 

Which say, it’s worth keep trying can’t sure always hard. Please refer rocky bullwinkle clarity think does, think care. endgame so... Yeah. Well. Guess New York sized problem now. 

Leaders make tough decisions. you’re going cave line work gets hard, leadership problem. takes fine make people wear masks, fine.

It’s long slow painful death usually resulting multiple organ death. took New York Minute, too. ""Financial death spiral""...so dramatic. Americans already financial debt often even good reasons (new car, eating restaurants, vacations). Americans made habit living beyond means complaining bill comes due last 80 years. reiterate Americans could come $400 $500 dollars, would require sacrificing frivolous things. two classes people option: homeless monks taken vow poverty (both get free health care most, all, nonprofit hospitals, fyi).

I’m 28! wouldn’t wish anyone. Autonomic disorders still poorly understood many doctors, symptoms debilitating.

It’s truly life ruining! hope there’s anything good come pandemic understanding awareness types invisible illnesses. maybe better treatment options prognoses! blatant lies gaslighting - USA feels like North Korea regard. us know blatantly false statement is, government still proclaims confidently, cultish base buys line, hook sinker Eric trump voters You’re okay administration quarantining people?

There's good choices here, menu bad choices. Like, want french fries little glass lot glass? option fresh, lightly salted, truffle-oil fries long menu.

That means hard choices, seeing long progress made.

Yes, economy tanking, many people get sick it'll tank anyways regardless businesses open not. Rosie Cher? *any* country want borders open right now? There’s pandemic. Right, flu almost exactly symptoms were.

I chills, aches, dizziness, mild cough Friday, called job (healthcare-related, I'm still working). Monday, felt mostly fine - little tired breath, it. (and worried me), smell taste anything.

I decided get test, job made stay home waited results. thought, ""This stupid. it, cold/allergies/whatever."" Three days later, got results, positive. 

I felt fine. gotten positive result, would've job, infecting co-workers. mystery scenario. tax breaks him, family, wealthy, even aggressive policy breaking environmental/air/water quality regulations. 

'Make America Great Again' means return America industrial revolution hell-hole acid rain, polluted rivers, near non-existent health care working class, unregulated industrialists running show. opposed something like contemporary Netherlands, progressive healthcare, bikes common sedans, highly educated population little class conflict.

Urban, coastal America held back uneducated backwaters centuries now. Electoral College probably favors. say imported cases coming from? passenger flights resumed region? Leaving completely influence? '/s' stands sarcasm.

He's sarcastic. proud state...Connecticut actually ZERO deaths today first time since mid March (not fluke either, we’ve single digits quite bit lately) numbers new cases less 100 per day (have while). Folks, masks work social distancing works. Hopefully people get message. really don’t want go March/April here. mean thousands people wearing masks fact actually get infected unlike people states wearing masks got infected? Gee, wonder went   /s displays sarcasm did, do, extent. I'm also state cases even fewer deaths (NH). think lockdown helped us, especially since neighbor south lot cases seems awesome now. 

I'm go rallys bars right now, actually thought initial White House plan made sense. Wait cases went down, open bit, cases still go go further, open bit more.
 America pretty damned big, lot states also huge. get shutting areas spike, think California counties moment.

At point doesnt make sense shut NH Arizona trouble, lockdown ended doesnt mean dont distance wear mask, even get shit it. Utahn here. voting mail-in ballot several elections. never stand line again! 24 days left July, 133 972 current deaths.

667 Deaths per day rest month hit 150k

2751 Deaths per day hit 200k

If Florida/Texas/Arizona get bad New York New Jersey did, 200k possible. Likely end 150k, less 175k.

Again, unless stuff goes rails south. That’s little high. study NYC presumed 10x amount cases amount tested positive. testing available now, his/her original estimate 5-10x realistic build trench Vancouver Great Lakes 1km north 49th. would perfect many levels:

1) would create thousands jobs.

2) trench easier traverse Atlantic Pacific Oceans making Canada billions traverse fees.

3) use dirt build wall side trench, improving national security 100 fold.

4) extra dirt used create land bridge Ellesmere Island Hans Island permanently ending border dispute Denmark. Hundreds dollars saved since need leave Canadian Club anymore.

Finished post title there!

I'm kidding, but... really... 

(I'm Canadian). People coming though still. many still getting tourists. UK going route us that’s reason feel we’re alone something ... Dr. Fauci *last* authority left trust mess Birx sold us kiss Trumps ass. Fauci [didn't mind lying one minds lying anymore. Trump shown country world consequence it. Lie, cheat, gaslight...it *will* get ahead. get caught, tell base good. They'll forgive you. else going do? Believe side?

The [meat shortage lie wanted keep plants open could keep shipping meat closed China market hot. meat plants become plague zones, theyll shut real, leave us without food, we'll get starve factory owners made bank shipping meat labor China. 

This gaslighter nation winner one collects enough cultists. 3 4 weeks, saw it, America 3 weeks Jun 15-16 low. going lot worse week goes on. know im exhausted talking you. Corona? understand. government told us safe. reopened restaurants. 

So mean they're supposed safe? mean tell POLITICIANS lied me? Vancouver get rental car. came Alberta licence, pls don’t shoot I’m local! 90% Floridians think stay too. mom's friend got tested Thursday find positive Monday. I’m American truly believe entire population quarantined notice. every where. believe medical reasons can’t must face guard. seems like taking serious. see photos real world hits would hardly call discussion. talking stupid difficult rather draining it’s super mild asymptomatic, tests could likely give lots false negatives. Antibody tests show death rate 0.8% overall, can't even handle getting housing low income people much less anyone else. CDC believes general undercounting 10x 20x

Containment gone US. keep fighting flatten curve keep hospitals overrun (or rather keep overwhelmed), eliminating without vaccine impossible personally fills rage, there's nothing one person force others behave rationally. think citizens either arrogant/ignorant understand, selfish care...maybe both.

My background mathematics, economics, data analysis distinctly remember laughed January coworkers superiors cautioned becoming pandemic. Literally laughed at...and studied years learn analyze type data...but... that's people behave here. rarely value informed; makes little sense.

That's honestly majority morale mentally States, mind-boggling. people can't explain it, laugh it, unless directly affects them, ignore it. many needlessly dying.

So completely honest you, truly feel never numbness had. People constant state politicized disillusionment likely effect horrible public education lack leadership.

Hmm inmates nowhere go ELSE HAPPENING: Always 😷 live chicago lots friends live Brooklyn, I’ve many arguments assholes claim protests caused FL, TX, AR. way bigger protests them. 

The protests showed us wearing masks, outside, isn’t significant risk. People happy that. 

Enclosed crowded spaces spread virus. shed divisions via race, unify class. repolled every single day? keep seeing this, always similar results replying said. say we’re fucking superpower. I’m responding to. need step real world America (yes greatest country) hold esteem had. reported elsewhere knew it! :) *Press X Doubt*

In seriousness, hopeful, I'm sure I'd trust vaccine coming American government right now. certainly trust Chinese one. Hell, I'm even sure I'd trust Oxford one, given many safety procedures thrown window around world, little published regarding results. ON. ot. Clearly schools BC fucking trash look up. Wikipedia: “Between 1915 1926, world-wide encephalitis lethargica pandemic occurred, impacting nearly 5 million people killing estimated 1.6 million people.”

Wait what?! 5 million?! never heard this?!!! India lot people lot poverty, poverty people less hygienic.

It's gonna get worse  data suggests exactly COVID-19 positive patients smoke often asymptomatic exhibit less severe respiratory symptoms non-smokers... Stimulation macrophage ACh receptors nicotine inhibits pro-inflammatory cytokines production inflammatory response. drink money, ice. cheap me. They're used wearing them. started lab job wear lab coat n95 shift took days change breathing adapt. couple weeks ago drove full 45 minute commute home mask still on. part days.

Tell wear mask around house, watching TV cooking diner. They'll get used fidgeting store. fucking arrest them.  still letting people walk rest us put us danger? I'm enjoying discussions, not? Yeah though many local sheriffs refusing enforce mask mandate. pissing off. least Abbott eventually made mandates. even though took way long. dont think Florida Man lives New Zealand believe absolutely correct mystery scenario. tax breaks him, family, wealthy, even aggressive policy breaking environmental/air/water quality regulations.

I worry either those. Major Tax changes pass house passing anything administration come november regulation changes take time implement quickly reversed 3 months. Worse case scenario creates international incident sabotages incoming administration transitional plans like said spite pardons people rot jail..

That scenario realizes leaving power. Given issues pandemic raises voting surprised tie country litigation conspiracy theory claiming really many weeks.

You money electoral college . lot nonsense gone trump administration gone trump care  majority american's opinions. away electoral college good function - make sure high population cultures overly dictate smaller pop cultures like example farmers. However definitely needs tweaking. Well now... one group never thought would wear masks... guess intelligent people among clothed portion society. ""in one month"" ... assume they're talking June 1-30? checking numbers Infection2020.com ...

* Texas death count 6/30 = 2,444; death count 6/1 1,689; June, that's 755 COVID deaths TX.

* Florida death count 6/30 = 3,507; death count 6/1 2,453; June, that's 1,054 COVID deaths FL. states, that's 1,809 deaths June.

* look [lethal hurricanes since 2000: count 23 Allison, 59 Rita, 9 Erin, 84 Ike, 5 Hermine, 103 Harvey 5 Imelda. that's 288 hurricane deaths Texas.

* looking [hurricanes killed Floridians since count 322 deaths, 91 tagged ""indirect"" deaths. added Texas deaths, that's 610 hurricane deaths states.

So.... yeah. Newsweek's claim check out, even close, COVID caused nearly 3x many deaths. put another way, could said ""more deaths 30 years"" 40 years hurricanes, COVID killed last two weeks 20 years canes, etc. Hmmm, believe? distinguished scientist hundreds articles co-authored man can't spell 500 word vocabulary. I'm going twitter master! dad wore mask caught (recovered) Fuck guy! Van round fucking imbiciles already charged gross negligence dereliction duty... put fucktards prison next decades, see like it.

""Sweden wrong"" tripe. Swedish people (and Scandinavians) never admit they're perfect get defensive called shit. least Americans acknowledge it. Swedes need grow hell shit. gravy seals would storm hotels liberate covid patients. Eh, press get US Sweden pointedly taking “if people die die” approach. Like, goal herd immunity willing sacrifice lot collateral damage kill fair amount people “for economy”. How’s economy going deal many dead situation improving? are, Texas 5x normal rate pneumonia deaths since March.. Get experience leave Scandinavia Canada medicare passed. Man, even North Korea things better USA point. Tens millions people left containment zone, no. guess what, team China investigate origin virus: Singapore asian networks reported it, can't find many western networks same. wonder why. Hahahaha!  Yeah actually agree you. They've bungled start present. They've offered nothing value, worse, gave idiot politicians reasons doubt actual protective measures. Sad true, helpful. don’t. PAs don’t even undergrad medical health focus. 

I agree he’s likely completely responsible death face criminal charges well facing charges whatever board licenses him. North Korea shut schools, Florida's going reopen. Florida report new hospitalizations consider average amount time people stay hospital, infer something many people hospitalized.

Jun 7 saw 762 hospitalizations previous 7 days.

Jul 7 saw 1854 hospitalizations previous 7 days.

Meaning however many people actually hospital today, something like twice many hospital month ago. (I say twice many rather 2.5 times June 7th downward slope, upward slope would tend depress total vs then.) rich used get richer. I'm shocked. Mother: doctors, nurses scienc people dumb, hydroxychloroquine fix immediately, sure it, nurse!

\*daughter dies\*

Mother: \*pikachu face\* basically anything occurs pandemic coronavirus news? too! Nothing says victory like surrender! least 5% still recovering Neil Peart's death I'd like see stats long term symptoms. see Rape UTI News Thank you!! It’s crazy sensation. normally sensitive sense smell, hope comes back soon reason feel bad. expected. home dog.

Stay safe healthy. Give good boy treat stranger internet &lt;3 children, also families. children likely survive they'll go home infect mom, dad, grandmothers grandfathers. adults end getting sick. higher ed institutions cutting professor pay. worst part is, :( freaking global pandemic going on! 0o

Sorry want die infect family, guess. 
There evidence vaping better medicine nicotine replacement (patches). evidence combustible tobacco users either become dual users vaping, become addicted vaping instead. believe vaping companies sell addictive product marginally better traditional tobacco. Wait.. trump say democratic states know doing? Hummm. feel it? Ron DeSantis sacrificing students politcs.  first one mention Trump particular thread. 

Deaths lag cases, I’m sure agree there. I’m withholding opinion death rate trend couple weeks, particularly since I’m current case surge state. past couple weeks trend death rate reflection new cases prior that. hope state’s case surge doesn’t translate spike deaths, statistics haven’t shown reality far. Older people socially distancing. Problem solved. hard believe frat students would make irresponsible choices.... Nope. Hes immune Thanks friend! I’m glad don’t feel sick anymore, appetite everything normal even have/had think worst part over. Grateful generally healthy habits first place almost like disease spreads differently among different age groups. making things up. Show us spray anyone head toe. managed this. aggressively contact trace quarantine, disinfect places (not people) possible exposure. wear mask fits then, ya goofball. Hospitalization rates plateau'd! ^(because we're beds) Protect Serve? What's about? think I'd accepted t20 college, hah One hospitals associated university prepared used student dorms Whip Swedes! going shut everything next month? Except police national guard rounding everyone breaking curfew? Newsom needs put reopening halt.

I worried LA become another New York people keep ignoring social distancing rules. Ah good see engaging good faith! comorbidities, get COVID-19, die, pretty obvious COVID-19 killed you. someone gets car accident, covid symptoms, lungs massively damaged, later heart gives out... 

Here study yale looks reported covid deaths excess deaths march april. Based reporting day, plan ""Let people get used rising death toll. They'll ignore it."" God... 

We're never going able use passports again... 😔🤦‍♀️ look graph see we'll getting higher death rates soon enough. We're almost 60k cases day, April hit 40k peak, 60k look like going peak. expect see deaths cases coming around 2 weeks now. That’s people Maine came from, genius. I'm guessing Sweden butt end jokes years come, this. Look bright side: catch cause long-term effects, least far alone that, (by statistical probability) put disadvantage compared anyone else nation. We'll harmed, we'll majority probably big enough voting block government policies made accordingly.

TL;DR: least everyone else fucked are. foreigners run circles around us. It’s right wear mask get sick, it’s job treat me. DON’T CARE don’t PPE get sick die.

You don’t like it, quit get work home job instead. /s Racist trash. Fuck KKK scum cases hypothyroidism children temporary, especially it’s milder case.

And adults there’s actually good evidence treating low grade hypothyroidism doesn’t necessarily yield lot health benefits. milder cases get treated end patients feeling same. suspect that’s you’re finding hard get treatment, especially system like NHS focus lot overtreating people keep costs down.

If feel better medications though them. Everybody’s different tough guys say ventilator. Sending kids school 6....?

I almost never sick kids. sick 2-4 times school year.

If 100 adults getting infected single party. takes one kid spread 100s get goes back kids families.

What? We're running 650K tests per day now. mid-April barely 150K. really think going herd immunity. ""SCHOOLS OPEN FALL"" tweet Potus kind makes sound way... God bless America! Nothing funny it, use good pun.

It present differently everyone sure possible. lack smell pretty much dead giveaway suffering from. okay Trump said need stop testing numbers go down!

Sadly, several States (Texas, Florida, Alabama) moron Governors actually seriously stop tests.

Worse still, today might even peak. There's always next week, next month, Coronavirus says: ""Hold beer""  55,000 won’t pay treatment. Insurance companies say ‘you gotta wear mask won’t cover treatment.’ Know I’m sayin? so, tired winning. Or/and sound confident... Wow sound pretty mad. trump going around saying low?

Actually, plural 'Goose' 'Assholes'. think similar percentage Americans feel same.

I tell one thing sure. going that, expected die, several days definitely would fine dying, would *never* wish anyone else infected me. get angry people say ""it's flu"" people say never influenza. 
Even covid got sick that, people saying ""a 24 hour flu"" ""the stomach flu"" seasonal allergies gastroenteritis.
But people saying ""covid flu"" really gets me. highly doubt many people saying ever actually flu. Kaiser particular insurer/provider hardcore conservative things honestly it’s bad policy them. yeah, get sure abt vault check harvard's endowment. Actually 3% say open restrictions.

I want ever happen country again. want another Patriot Act situation led ruination millions lives directly indirectly. patriot act would Iraq War. would trillions debt would shitty state in. Look around you. Look infrastructure, schools, social services sure billions give war contractors.. 

So again.. Going back issue. choose liberty even dangers health. mean reckless allow another event like Patriot Act occur. 50 hospitals Florida, dozens Texas Louisiana, ran ICU space due Covid19 patients, lying incompetent? 

The 130,000 deaths, thats 100,000 deaths greater statistical average last five years, either deceitfully incompetently counted?

Or maybe case number high actually high well, fart general direction, sleep well insults/edgy statements, bad spelling grammar, repeated comments seemingly focused 100% controversial political topics. I'm almost certain kind bot/Russian troll account.  Numb definitely. I've seen many people wearing masks incorrectly all. Seriously, number seems low. know group Sask sending people back use travel Alaska excuse reacting? They're going Disney World weekend, tells anything. Yea mass track stop like world states counties stubborn. get reasn come on. Like joke. Family mwmbers died. wife month. serious. hope everyone votes xhange becuae this. Get us back track Oh, yeah. finished Great Influenza author writes encephalitis lethargica. It’s never conclusively proven come 1918 flu, disappeared 1930, that’s researchers think it’s connected.

So scary fascinating. got this!! That's first recognized identified. we're pretty certain, that's originated.

Now know look for, found sewage water samples predating Wuhan outbreak going back far March 2019 (that one Spain).

It's possible could circulating slowly years finding population center mutating contagious form became noticable something abnormal. Without knowing existed, would easy write small outbreaks put one two hospital flu pneumonia.

We even able find patient zero Wuhan outbreak. There's many unknowable variables involved get steps away patient zero, especially mobile society, backtraceing becomes informed guesswork best narrow region planet. going think going jail US. government exile. thanks really myopic view metric. I’d need see strong evidence material amount negatives aren’t reported across US concerned. see considering medical professionals, regardless stripped rights practice. said coroners report shows progress treatment given girl along way. parents try made horrible choices. think trying kill wouldn’t stressed extraordinary measures end. think reality hit end tried backtrack. Still negligent homicide imo minimum two never allowed anywhere near hospital patient Yes. Deliberately. cannot ignore deaths 900 1 day 1 month

That really matter states taking holiday weekend's worth data putting one day. thing happened memorial day. typical lag, everybody looking 7 day average. compare next days last week well. Republican districts want anything lockdown masks even democratic areas problems law enforcement anything. Uh...it quite literally job handle violent people. actual fuck? But... since Canadians travelling abroad year, opportunity Canadians visit Canada. Honestly, I' seen world I've seen Canada, expensive travel domestically.

Unfortunately, still expensive 2020 I'm probably gonna travel locally either. want blow mind? took vacation three weeks April. worked less thre

Yup, talk stock market number jobs. conveniently ignore fact huge chunk America living poverty huge chunk jobs pay living wage. Recently? Try 40 years Australia states handfull cases day easing restrictions early June got hand Victoria escalated 100 day.

After 4 days 100 Victoria locked capital full level 3 restrictions 6 weeks states closed borders Victoria. That's 1000km border couple million people police enforced lockdown.

By comparison mind boggling look American states situation incomparably worse. stupid, evil.

I say premeditated murder. tried posting good news thread day deaths 92%. downvoted thread deleted. Proves people don’t like good news want doom gloom. Technically use k 000 placeholder wrong. M. 1M = 1000, 1MM = 1,000,000. can't even math right. would 4% thats double estimate 1918 H1N1 outbreak. Say ain't Agree would still like see changes Keep mind trade phase 3 assured increase deaths, enjoy/celebrate zero death day even cover 1% Oh shit learned dual wield emotions!!! Level bro!!! Agreed 100%. definitely us reaching herd immunity naturally. Pretty good piece part CJC's ongoing coverage coverage Coronavirus, winding trajectory masks prophylactic political tool. forgotten frequently experts waffled back forth early days, February particular, subject masks efficacy reducing Coronavirus outbreaks. One expert even claimed lay person know wear properly opposite effect inducing false sense security. author mentions partially foundational explanation polarized attitudes towards donning masks become months since messaging February. author's view,the virus political affiliations election year amplified and, read it, media certitude one way helping matters.On one side media, contempt experts seen elites who,besides, weak lack consistency. other, absolute acceptance expert views may flawed unquestioningly pushing expert views without question!&lt;

It's longish feeling piece even totally word count makes novel arguments. there's passage recommend reading follows Expertise, many news organizations felt, defended bad-faith attacks. press got slow down. Reporters need accept ambiguity uncertainty. Rather rush toward facile answers simplistic assertions, stories must reveal profound complexity problems hand. must humble.That may feel counterintuitive, given immediacy pandemic, centrality lives, need know much get back normal. It’s press’s job, part, bring responsible sense urgency collective quest greater knowledge—including whether masks worn. work cannot done responsibly don’t take time ask essential questions open every possible window understanding. coverage vital public health information truthful unless it’s patient. Ed Yong, Atlantic science writer (and master authorial humility), put April, science “less parade decisive blockbuster discoveries press often portrays, slow, erratic stumble toward ever less uncertainty.” convey reality readers, earned trust. sharing bathrooms. could possibly go wrong? Finding origin help find cure....in movies anyway lol 100% agreed, point we’re double fucked guys come here. That's technically true think bar setting low one two weeks ago. Statistically scale gets worse get older, babies seem risk almost deaths reported infants worldwide. We’re getting much better treating disease lot equipment deal severe cases now. Hospital staff also much better equipped now. 

Along fact common cheap steroid recently found cut ICU death rates massive 25%. 

All points much lower death rates ever before. US seems offsetting good news cases - meaning phenomenal number people still die unnecessarily. words looking ""premeditated murder."" getting voted? can't even decide whether virus airborne not. seem fairly incompetent me. Trump pointed seem affected politics well.

Perhaps gained, doubt it. time polio smallpox communication greatly limited compared now. reason can't communication communication without organizing body carry out.

I see evidence world handling current crisis organized way globally. Seems every country thing without sort global leadership. stay closed.

-A US citizen. 


We’re fucked. 😞 No, read article infectious something is, higher percentage (between 70-90%) needs be. Measles, example, estimated require 90% herd immunity prevent outbreak. However, looking articles again, I’m seeing “at least 70%” relation specifically COVID. So, knows? Given fact “at least” tells claim 70% enough would optimistic. 

Source: MayoClinic, jhsph.edu everyone, enough. Narcissists leader icon giving free reign, takes fuck rest us.  992 see US could partly holiday weekend backlog. We'll see overall trend goes coming days/weeks. Hopefully still downwards. Actually put level error Asian sample +/- 8.2% methodology. think poll pushes results wide margin error unreliable. Sorry. 1. Talk amazing are. best. Winning.
2. Take control, fire anyone knows they're talking about. Replace friends family give money/control. 
3. Fail utterly. Fail hard thoroughly one question badly failed.
4. Take zero responsibility. Blame everyone else. Talk failing never failed.
5. Take profits hide them. Declare bankruptcy. Pass debt investors supporters.
6. Start over. He's making excuses good policy GOP donors want poor people money. want die underclass. Maybe healthy realistic admit bad situations exist instead attempting cope denial ignorance. Sheriffs elected officials can't simply fired. trump absolved nursing homes patient death liability could states. It’s still going many. Nursing home testing mandatory. indoor dining bars (Newsom put OC list counties must close indoor dining, bars, stuff SURGE).

Downtown disney retail outdoor dining/takeout only. aggressive mask enforcement, reasonably OK (tho amount time people tend spend World Disney store might make high-risk compared typical in-and-out retail experience). 

I wonder crowd control prevent getting ""too full"" - otherwise there's way hell anyone could stay 6 feet anyone else crowds likely there... hope state governors contingency plans station National Guard troops around hospitals. fear people start showing armed; need demanding ICU ventilators etc. 400 would accurate next week get dude. whole thing fucking ridiculous. feel like i'm going mad. People dying tens thousands. Hundreds thousands people, shit millions, hanging thread, knowing they'll able keep roof heads feed kids, going senate takes fucking vacation, money got straight stolen. evil fucking parasites get whats coming man. They're literally stealing us killing us point. Yeah insight charge training programs top. 

I’d like hear solution people hanging even start conversation. Even so, US that's vociferous comes criticizing China's transparency?

It's almost like badly responded country decently correlated belligerence China. merits never required proving. that’ll real problem, spreads schools it’ll infect entire households. Similar always was, possibly adjusted depending adjusted exposure world? you’re staying home more, washing hands more, etc you’re probably less likely get/spread germs general. However, plenty people aren’t things thus likely getting infected spreading stuff per usual. Also, experiencing increased stress, make susceptible illness general. dare you.

Using logic sub? Using double debunking debunk false studies declared drug harmful helpful. must banned truths! pandemic might that. I’d prefer straight eat everything locusts don’t mind may never reopen 😂 fuck wrong religious fucks... way worded headline makes seem like 3M current case number. Especially coupled ""fears overwhelmed hospitals"". coupling number current event make number seem current. sure hope Trump administration approves “warp speed” vaccine, one else takes it.

I wouldn’t buy it.

I’d rather wait months one reputable administration different country. state Florida ceased testing result zero new COVID-19 cases. addition state Florida reclassified previous deaths attributed COVID-19 unknown / natural causes adhere new Whitehouse guidelines. seeing happening US. many people would scream rights Awesome. Nice setup cheap. half sitting garage.

r/redneckengineering It’s literally even felony knowingly give someone HIV California anymore. 

Let go. shouldn’t damn felony. That’s insane highly authoritative. Yesterday literally lowest day since early March. Exactly. Trump doesnt care long term consequences (if already obvious), wants something else blame pandemic on. Loot America people busy dying. New American way... Trump end us continues like this.

This goes beyond stupid. putting children's lives risk. evil demonic. Alexa, two wrongs make right? honest, (really unfortunately) think 100 modest number considering amount new cases reported. kind damage heal time? mindboggling anymore. denialism denialist. I'm little silly, we've seen people willing adamantly vocally insist huge historical events - maybe us saw first Holocaust deniers - never happened, (when presented evidence), amend hold never happened scale presented, central claims (such gas used kill) false. we've seen convince others form movements. natural inevitable as... People enjoying alcohol, pursuing sex, overeating, disgusted corpses. Unboggle thyself.

This disease 21st century, although democratized electronic media like social media platforms making visible. existed throughout history, associated kinds psychological rationales effects, say, brain reason. brain perceive objective reality impartially report, protect promote individual riding skull of, get resources mates them. show whatever deems best useful continued stability. Stuff challenges perceptions, attacks ego, makes us question worldview... Hurts. We're good avoiding attacks, good things individual ego, even they're sometimes good society. Denying reality useful psychoprotective tool. not? Maybe successful strategy, maybe backfires... long maintains equilibrium perception ego makes person functional, good. perception gathers enough steam become broad narrative, maybe position influence movement transition political power. 

And reality becomes increasingly confusing, times great change, many people many core perceptions challenged once... instinct circle wagons perception, generate promote counternarrative... greater widespread shared. call denialism, individual practices denial forming movements positions, like ism... Marxism, Capitalism, Denialism. That's label use discuss social phenomenon inevitably arises psychosocial reality.

So maybe used think people rational, saw clearly this. Presented evidence perception may true, mind boggles. comfortable? choice now, since presented, deny reality come something like better (maybe like deciding one group people, Others, this? sounds comfortable, even pleasurable..) accept new information human minds malleable, reactive, naturally ""selfish"", naturally lead massive denial reality. think mean Disney World. Disneyland still closed. already seeing thread dumb you? US uses progressive tax bracket means higher income bracket, higher taxes. rich higher income definition. let name verb.

Why people like always resort emotional responses presented facts logical positions?

In fact, covid, wear patch 5 days sickest go downstairs smoke, even thought dying, extremely stressed able smoke. Florida's average daily deaths 6 days ago 39. 50% daily deaths 6 days. claims deaths flat holding. deaths certainly I'm curious - ""few years longer""?

NYC COVID antibody tests free, without insurance. WH says must true! hospital resources get taxed Belgium positivity rate 40% peak. US never 25%.

I claim otherwise, claimed number tests per million What? We're running 650K tests per day now. mid-April barely 150K.

I said **last month**, mid April almost three months ago really. Herd immunity works maintain certain % non-infectable people times regardless attained. could vaccination, could infection, could mixture. ""fast"" perceptions, ""fast"" relative long immunity persists thru whatever method.

in case measles gotta vaccination want deal 15% mortality rate reach thru infection, want deal one highest R0 values known epidemiology (nasty little tiny airborne fucker measles). 

Note vaccine, ""herd immunity"" chicken pox everyone COULD catch chicken pox safely young (Because want catch first time adult, much severe/deadly then) - probably misplaced ""covid parties"" coming from. That's good approach adults already recovered immune chicken pox - novel virus going spread vulnerable populations. intentionally exposed chicken pox ""chicken pox party"" friends' parents organized one sick. less 10 years later vaccine came out. hopefully i'm last cohort people deal potential shingles. Never.. pretty sure electors leaders country immune things like that. Fuck Australian, bingo Bango Charlie tango. That’s usually men neck beards. mean Trump’s base screwed. DeSaruman space force years except named that. Airforce used name Army Airborn Division. Gradually grows becomes entity. Individualism work Honestly even China didn’t say anything fact locking major cities constructing field hospitals left right forcibly quarantining people pretty obvious clue start preparing ourselves.

Just idiotic pretend like disease wouldn’t eventually spread. Wednesday high confirms genuine rise, today's total already counteracted low numbers long weekend. 7-day rolling deaths back 556 weekend. Thanks saying this! I'm young, relatively healthy teacher, I'm sooooo worried myself, worry many teachers staff members older medical conditions. get pretty much every sickness goes around school, almost feels inevitable get Covid. Also, sooo many students live grandparents, likely bring home them. going shit show.  Everybody family that. Europe densely-packed US. 

The second-most dense city US (San Francisco) done relatively well. 

For months now, many worst-hit areas country rural areas. example, April rural counties far fewer deaths overall, compared large cities New York Seattle, higher relative death rates. they've made Police investigating confrontation Old City video shows bar owner pulling gun

**OLD CITY** \- video man pulling gun Old City launched criminal investigation. meantime, man receiving death threats.

“I saw something really bad going happen,” said Liz Krieger said.

Krieger drinks friends Old City Sunday night found middle heated confrontation.

“He says, ‘You MAGA privilege.’ Jamie pulled gun said, “Trump 2020,” pointed guy’s face,” Krieger explained.

The man pointing gun identified Jamie Atlig. He’s owner Infusion Lounge, right outside incident happened.

He says words exchanged, one threatened.

“It looked like, point, drawing gun, black, metal object reached behind,” Atlig stated.

It turns metal object bicycle lock. shots fired. Atlig license carry. Witnesses say stunned.

Along running lounge, Atlig security consultant training law enforcement weapons physical combat. says knows threat.

“He owns business. threatened well patrons. pulled duly licensed firearm. diffused situation. put firearm away,” stated attorney Robert Gamburg.

Some wonder gun necessary?

“A bike lock doesn’t warrant gun pulled you,” Krieger said.

Since video gone viral, Atlig says he’s receiving death threats. But, says he’s threatened before.

“I don’t like bullies. guys try bully want. wrong person,” Atlig added. Yes!!!! like tornados earthquakes, days tornado. Every fucking day earthquake day. 

Plus, over, tornado destroyed long narrow path, maybe tens miles long. Help rush sides. Earthquakes hurricanes destroy shit hundreds miles. fucking help coming.

Big yikes Same. miss morning night inhaler rips feel within hour normal time...aka asthma sucks. wear mask day long work...In Florida 50% outside/50% inside, issues breathing. Decluttering cultural priorities! &lt;3 great line. 

One things struggle fact lot local effort pays larger visible dividends appreciable systemic impact. I'm ""making do."" logic behind statement....wait, there’s logic, he’s republican. Vote Green Party. two children attend NSW school recently confirmed COVID19 case amongst one educators there. children deemed close contacts (as approx 100 others believe). close contact children families quarantined 14 days, school closed two days deep cleaning. 

Suprisingly case case school infections state, transmission close contact children (as far Know anyway).

It appears children either less susceptible catch virus, transmit , show symptoms ? knows? Either way, NSW health contacted us order children take part study help analyse questions above. I'm keen participate! wanna cause chaos together? I've saying seems like months father dies this, legitimately nothing lose. He's person alive matters me. bet ass I'm gonna cause something. do, think they’re even better knowing exactly buttons push trump, needs much push Sorry America spreading stupid Wiscos dropped today three days higher. often think people get ""deserve"" ""justice"" system?

*looks awkwardly Toronto, Hamilton, southern Ontario* happening US. 👍👍 I'm sorry enjoy childhood. Sounds terrible. Thank sharing. 

What actually bring table? benefit US? observation answers - nothing benefit.

Therefore, need spend US taxpayers's dollars WHO. Cut em off, done move on. 

If read news today, pressured disclose / acknowledge info airborne transmission post warnings website. known months virus airborne. like good job here. basically useless organization. I, American taxpayer, wish fund vote accordingly. honestly, video spreads bs could harm human life, illegal banned internet. that, people going think ""cover ups"" shit Nope correct. party much want. young immune virus. Party on!! Oh frat party UW. 121 infected.

We're splitting hairs whether truly airborne rides aerosols. get sick either way... someone ignorant dismissive science become elected representative citizens? hope people aren’t dumb enough take statements seriously. would lead even worse conditions. watching develop spare time reddit subs January/February got really good idea transmitted way became problem US. rich asshole team gave fuck could mobilized country effective way failed. still failing today. try blame China die-hard Fox news cult followers go along it. everyone else 100% responsible level damage Covid-19 done US. used special equipment gauge protectiveness masks measuring number particles 0.3 micrometer air number particles space masks faces.

What somehow read: pRopErTy VaLUe!!!1 fair, people ""evacuate""(quarantine)initially last long. would imagine told evacuate entire hurricane season much less people would would come back early threat hurricane season passed. like saw weeks stay home/quarantine.

Nice Jesus Christ. really end world. “ Non-woven masks passed filtering performance tests 100-percent leakage rate worn properly. Worn correctly, leakage rate dropped 50 percent.” looked it. hes republican would fine vaccine every quarter! Quite done damn virus! Wrong new information comes virus change guidance? science works. really think gotten treatment? brother EMT Florida gets sick dies murderous public policy decisions asshole refuses listen public health experts, god help know do. college literally starting inperson classes fall last 3 weeks remote covid cold....

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  cant find old n95s ive seen claim be. people wear masks wearing cloth masks. icu full... can’t fill icu past 100%. Right? Maybe said can't say something unbelievably stupid. mistake. 

Also, go Harvard always mean smart.... Today better day realize US population fucking stupid. Conspiracy theory China towards US mostly focus closure Fort Detrick August possible transmission military game Wuhan. mean ? Floridians listen storms come. Source: Floridian, take storms death viruses seriously. food ok? damage vitamins like vitamin absorption issue? feel (at point) inevitable metro areas going filled cases. Even states looked pretty good starting slip. 

The anti-mask propaganda strong many areas. ah, we’re entering ketchup sandwich phase Well three outbreak studies I've seen say many places hospitals risks. One involved office, one involved restaurant, one involved choir, 

So place enclosed air circulation exposed infected person speaking one hour yelling/singing 5 minutes.

That means, indoor bars, restaurants, movie theaters, schools etc. hospitals. Look outbreak clusters keep popping china Korea.

One hour exposure enclosed environment someone infected may provide sufficient viral load get infected. assumes one wearing mask. Hit nail head. It’s exactly this. Biden like 90s moderate Republican digress. wanna guess party moron from?  Passports necessary visa so.. get you’re saying it’s kind semantics context. canopy reduce protective nature outdoors. please show said want anyone else work?? play golf yourself, can't play tennis yourself? think colleges gonna follow harvard online fall. K12 follow well problem understand demand side economics. think economic activity generated rich people like sucking money everything. happening China lately virus. really heard news outside US lately Brazil. China second wave, continuing report... insane federal government count can’t on, doesn’t mean embrace insane approach can’t count either.

Well, I'm open suggestions idea. Good thing left essentially 0 electoral power guess. silly take weve ratcheting right last 30 years. Yes cast members rode ride 1000 times probably. Imagine Karen’s there. I'm sure policy enforced fairly among races socioeconomic classes. Every public health official: need testing

This dude: get tested pretend happening!!!1!1! stay closed dudes mad house wish someone would save Exactly Reopening political statement.

It based reasoning. think would no-brainer.  Could enlighten TMC Well Mayor Butts, parading around BLM protests without mask. Please continue brother EMT Florida gets sick dies murderous public policy decisions asshole refuses listen public health experts, god help know do. think race issues often class issues disguised ""race"" category keep low class separated less powerful. say someone grew wealthy neighborhood. country hates poor people. HATES Poor people. blatant around us. Yet, US never class revolution. Everyone seems think they're part higher class actually are, like nobody wants actually align poor regardless fucked are. amazing. Health jack shit people doing. We're gonna make bra. Peasant.. golden face mask diamonds encrusted. Hiding.  aim anger correct direction: towards power prevent massacre listening experts it. know alot people going say time. one main reasons little help police dealing violent customers. Evertime called told 25-45 minutes officers respond. 10 minute walk station. Another time told 30 minutes, one cart pushers told us cop 20 feet entrance, asked come remove guy. Literally 30 ft move. I'm sure they'll ticket help, yeah 30 minutes. I'm super offended want cooties wtf man?  Go USA! U A! Americans! Freedumbs! This. Kids aren’t going back school fall. It’s fairy dust bullshit right now. Evidence seems suggest antibodies last months, testing poster would likely yield negative result whether Feb not. Plus, antibody tests still horribly unreliable. story

Hadn't heard before, nice story. Thanks sharing. People realize ICU's almost **always** capacity. operate 96-99% times. saying states need reverse lockdowns still plenty beds. Calling nurses “girls” “ladies” feels like peak DeSantis. Good job. number cases number infected masks, director kids’ preschool suggesting gaiter masks. They’re like turtlenecks pulled face. kids don’t need (outside, lunch) still around necks. Even little kids easily get down. 

Now, finding ones fit kid could tough. thought good idea general wanted pass along. Yes first going super slow felt like lot time got depressed it’s one big blur time time doesn’t matter basically wait meals sleep :( job now. Yes, gotten lot air time US. nicotine may help protect getting it, smoker get it....its much worse lungs already damaged. 

They know forms nicotine work (that I've seen) like patches. may nicotine inhaled lungs. seen testing vaping yet, either. take empty ICU beds one 35 hospitals haul hospitals? Ya dummy.

For health probably lot said it. Also might explain Europe well, use far less AC states outside dining much popular Europe. Bars serve food..... guy refused wear mask would offend God. misleading headline attached it. I'm sorry no.  People wearing masks many, many, many, many years healthcare vocations extended periods time absolutely issues whatsoever.  even like required wear medical grade masks anything long nose mouth covered making complaints asinine. big fuss asymptomatic transmission Feb March even tough China clearly warned 26/01/2020 people infectious 14 day incubation period.

I've repeated observed sort thing happen waves.  inconceivable amount data! contend opposite. pandemic proven last people want managing healthcare government. feel eventually destined one world government fucking reason can’t leave alone mostly (America, Russia, China, Israel Iran) would include North Korea they’re like annoying kid school picking fights running away shit gets real. Guys University Hospital says we've got COVID-19. going now?

Toga Party! 

Toga! Toga! Toga! Toga!! Yes, I’m really confused international student thought always case. thought announcing reminder given current health situation. states. like FL kept slowly going whole time. got end /s. need haha word old were? see article. good news middle/high schools trying re-open. agree you. Denial seems endemic everywhere.

So many people discount something want accept dismissing 'anecdotal evidence'. *all* using term incorrectly.

"" Wolfinger’s original statement *quite literally opposite* using. actually said “the plural anecdote data.” affect way think use data. [% Covid Tests Returned Positive 4/1 - data gathered 

This info impossible find, I've keeping myself. Bullshit! already knew existing coronaviruses spread respiratory droplets. prior information drove sensible country recommend widespread mask usage. CDC decided would make gamble coronavirus magically different others.

Fuck insistence amnesia. ""This happens people go crazy get tested,"" Vitale wrote. ""STOP GETTING TESTED!""

He claimed governor's administration using situation ""an excuse claim something happening happening magnitude say happening.""

""Have noticed never talk deaths anymore, cases?"" Vitale asked, even though Department Health reports 43 Ohioans died virus last 24 hours. ""And never talk recoveries. keep adding numbers feeding us 3 months ago!""

\---

recoveries listed clearly state dashboard point countries offer Americans refugee status. passport helpful. Yeah hard understand. work hospital hit hard covid far seen, every single person hospital shocked bad covid taking seriously. I'm pretty introverted myself. similar realizations. Except the, zero desire continue job can't work home permanently. equipment, including internet superior work. Whether willfully mislead country spare PPE stocks genuinely going information time suggesting masks make difference, unfortunate people choose respect recent advice.

It surprising, unfortunate, same. Mkay. bought year-long vacation insurance plan end February, like five vacations, international, planned next 12 months.

Yeah. beginning. starting see rise deaths came America ‘opened business’ Memorial Day. deaths lagging infection 4-5 weeks, wait late July August masses infected June going need urgent care. frustrating hell, lol. Reuters, BBC, associated press credible. tell way piss Democrats Republicans. BBC leans bit left dont get money DNC least. lot places also requiring 2 week quarantines travel assignments. # SHUT 👌🏿 don’t think they’re going allowed come enough problems CA. county 99% capacity ICU. county borders Arizona. couldn’t take wanted to. California though nearly 3 months. don’t think it’s realistic keep it. compound Florida state income tax make lack income higher sales tax. Needless say selling anything higher sales tax bring much revenue state coffers. Texas also lacks state income tax wonder factored governors decisions open states timeline did. report cases well let's smug.

I would suggest concentrate managing mess home stop projecting frustration. children died. 

Their families, teachers, school employees, families, though, another matter. Yes know aerosol transmission confirmed way back, want know difference certain scientists saying virus airborne vs already know aerosols. understanding aerosols airborne mean basically thing, big fuss now? Last read, median incubation period 4-5 days... unless that’s changed (it might have), numbers might show sooner 18th

Edit: clarification.. that’s true... let’s say people started 4th July weekend 3rd... add 4-5 days, we’re today. go get tested, can, I’d imagine drastic covid case increases Thursday/Friday. :c There’s need prove wanted dead, reasonable person could foreseen death resulting actions. COVID party + immunocompromised patient + refusal go hospital? Slam dunk. arent like 12k day now? idk this. Turns outside masked lead ton cases. 

It's indoors unmasked huge problem. See think oue unemployment checks dead folk Florida America's Brazil. America world's Florida. Oh..... smart people get Worst playing doctor IRL. demonstrated inability exercise sound judgement jobs health care industry. racists mad virus came China. think sentiment Chinese/Asian people eat weird, ""dirty"" food. That's seems people talking this. Reporting variance convenient might like. Mondays normally low reporting days. That's number February. accepted substantially lower now. Yes constant massive wars preferable constant low level carefully managed conflict. It’s ok, it’s like exponential growth 2 weeks starting 10,000 would get high right? joking husband hospital lays could go Florida Texas risk life bunch money.

But really don’t think it’s worth it. glorious leader Trump, 1.3 million Americans recovered covid. Far Obama's leadership. fact, single person recovered covid Obama power. 69% inside might thinking NYC. slight discomfort itch immediately assumed covid. Keep mind nyc took massive hit virus spreading one knew came Europe. NYS went lockdown cases exploded weeks longer.  30k deaths bad luck. ""Yesssss relish fear"" - liberals everywhere. They’re missing counties, I’d expect revision tomorrow Republicans standing ground oppressive government, they're government question. work Walmart associates think policy requiring us wear masks means take clock sales floor understanding still infections regardless building clocked not. Oh hell yes, virus really really need bats. 

And kind cool.   Oh god shut fuck Time polish old 2nd amendment. Lol touché. new outbreak from? rate President blowing yellow peril dog whistles. 
I would surprised Asian white coats start getting accused PRC bioweapons scientist infiltrators. ""catch up"" yesterday?

Lol know chart article golf riskier tennis. tennis, especially playing doubles, definitely running risk transmitting covid compared really solitary sport golf. thought NY topped 1000 deaths worst day? set ringtone exact part got babe movie im switching over. I'm sorry hear troubles. supposed self quarantine get test results. eligible 2 weeks full paid time due covid. passed first stimulus package, restrictions I'd definitely look it. wife scheduled c-section next Wednesday even know I'll allowed get test results back.

Edit: Families First Coronavirus Response Act law grants paid time 14 weeks. 2 weeks full pay rest 2/3 pay. undeveloping country... dont belong lumped y'all anyway. every things bigger texas 'gotten' even word Meanwhile US busy killing road rage incidents, petty us Coronavirus Failed matter perspective. (a certain idiot), can't make tests go slow enough. disgusting sickening nobody running show nothing done. won’t educate they’ll save money. must DeVos strategy. Thats stupid. people relieved less deadly originally thought forget US UNHRC, UNICEF, UNCLOS, IC Court. US getting step closer rogue nation status everyday. going give brojobs mask thou!? Private schools businesses too, even sounds shitty. Jesus Christ, can't January. IIRC testing spots outside UK, wanna say U.S., Brazil, somewhere else virus still rampant. We're simulating rocket chamber combustion here. lag plot sufficient model. see French trying become Florida man, unfortunately adopting Idiocracy.. Florida born it. Well yeah would someone want give money owed haha Cthulhu 2020 forgot fact 40% population think wearing mask political statement. Please stop. I'm nurse Florida. healthcare professionals train years ""help body job."" That's medicine is. magic, product hundreds years people learning heal others. 


Healthcare professionals human too. course get everything right. practice get better it. trained understand minimize avoid risks mistakes. dedicated entire careers learning, understanding, treating human disease. People master suddenly stop. keep doing, keep getting better, keep developing skills further. words, keep practicing. That's makes masters. 

&amp;nbsp;

This virus horrifically contagious. One person easily infect tens others. people spread tens people forth. virus spreading much faster treated. means hospital beds going filled faster emptied. local hospitals full (and take long contagious little done control it) patients sent hospitals states. That's fear mongering. That's foresight. 


We know virus primarily respiratory. Respiratory diseases spread droplets breathe, cough, sneeze out. Limiting spread disease means limiting *how* spreads. therefore minimize amount droplets escape air effectively done wearing face mask. purpose prevent inhaling people's droplets, reduce amount release air. CDC fucked massively saying face masks work. Saying work **very** different message saying people refrain using surgical masks reserve healthcare professionals opt cloth ones instead. 


I implore you. resolution pandemic depends cooperation us. Even body able defeat virus own, please know many people whose bodies cannot
and please understand everyone experience you. Again, implore you. Please minimize efforts us fighting front lines highlighting mistakes happen megaphones. Clearly forgot Alaska claiming Texas Florida biggest U.S. states does, right. elementary kids seem less likely super spreaders, jury still high school effect applies every week. fact significant. Nice!!

My husband obese I’m terrified one us dying leaving daughter. spent lot days crying March-May. 

We started working towards losing weight made slow progress first. It’s hard get started. wish gone hardcore back March could now!

That said husband lost 14 pounds BMI 40 now! barely hey it’s something. 

I’ve lost 10 pounds ways go I’m 40. 

I hate took pandemic I’m happy gave us kick butt needed. still get anxious lot can’t lose much would like us overnight. I’m hoping eventually catch COVID it’ll months we’ve made progress! 

Thanks sharing. makes feel less alone this! Wuhan installed cellphone based contact tracing lifted lockdown, people need scan Code Green cellphones enter public spaces pass temperature check, board bus fail temperature check, everyone bus everyone bus get isolated swabbed. test positive, cellphone trace everyone contact past, mandatory isolation swabbing.

Wuhan since ran project swab entire population city, tested 11 million people using batch testing, found 300 positive cases. 

Beijing never full lockdown early 2020 outbreak mid June, ran massive containment contact tracing program, regional lock-downs, tested 7 million people found 269 positive cases total. See aiming slowing virus down, aiming total eradication. control population tightly run massive batch testing. think situation comparable anywhere else world. Even reason fucking hate Trump. Hey, infect enough people, absolutely lowest death rate. one unexpected-but-true statistics, like issuing helmets WWI increased head injuries. miss Chili's. queso beef dip really good. worry people overweight never exercised day lives

Edit: grammar Tests per capita also low testing reveals disease widespread. South Korea extensive impressive levels contact tracing concentrating testing population. disease rampant US 5% currently infected, South Korea close 0.001% currently infected didn’t cite study. responded someone responded person did. Oh please, majority Americans stocks? Like what, $10k 401k can't even touch they're 65? Give break, people truly benefiting booming stock market elites wise average folk, vase majority counted ""owning stocks"" access gains.'

Personally gamble savings away SPY puts, I'd probably counted ""stock owner"" well since 2 shares AMZN. Yippee!! finances secure fucking AMZN massive bubble, great. People want state open want responsibility adapting new reality. either masks distancing, lockdown, people dying streets. Nothing else. First mistake going Subway. Come now. read teenagers. would assume younger end teenage years don’t know sleep camps 17-18 year olds maybe I’m old that’s thing now. Memorial Day similar thing took week everything sort everything started dropping again. Confirmed, governor said we’re LA, NY, CA. basically democratic president near end term public would like: ""they enough"" vote another republican drain us that's going work US tons people infected. Ok this, visited Covid 19 patients hospital? seen footage people getting buried mass graves? seen least one maybe learn Covid 19 real. saying 1 complete sentence link better job keeping people informed something like [this] exactly thinking. math off. [NYC 23,218 Covid Oh crazy Italian name!

*skims article

Yep! many man... Yeah dude, mini golf... So... parents storm White House? restaraunts near us incredibly busy takeout orders...and still going business. 

Apparently, lot places make profit things people buy much takeout like alcohol, soda, appetizers/dessert. Whose 19%. Asking U.S. citizen. Americans smoke freebase cocaine. still dont care idea situation situation hundreds thousands older smokers smoking since children 30+ years. Businesses ignore vivid restrictions public nuisances punished fullest extent possible. means lack will. means done fucked idiots. insurers like, oh ventilator counts emergency care, technically need room room charge covered. hospital charge ward stay 5 star hotels. family friends live laredo took covid seriously. Even oppose masks restrictions follow city quick fine/ticket people.

My friend sent snap sheriff walking around writing fines/citations people waiting line Sam's club mask using properly. 

When Abbott raised restrictions people little relaxed restrictions spikes Laredo back lockdown. “For faith, evidence necessary; without it, evidence suffice.” pandemic virus care official death toll is. Sooner later ""mysterious"" rise pneumonia deaths draw attention. Hoax theory great distraction anyone want see whole picture. missing, known ages? size droplets long lasts air makes officially airborne? 

I assuming airborne since first mention back early already just. 

Wtf. 

I knew sleeping sickness (from fly) jeez. I’m pretty ashamed us. Yes, idea medical history 100% giving medical advice. Take headlines earlier year, cross New York, replace Florida. could one today's lucky 10,000. I'm happy hear out. similar situation girlfriend lives outside US too. I'm really sorry going share anger idiots.

Kudos normalizing mask usage too!

Are still health issues virus? terrifying people see long term problems this. 

Hang there. thing really do. Stay strong support everyone can. Hopefully we'll get see soon. Lets honest. probably 5-10X real cases compared ones tested confirmed. we're probably 5-10% Florida population infected. Oh top leaderboard alright /eyeroll/ Dealing boss level Karen here.  must boofing playing Devil’s Triangle, know Kav’s favorite drinking game? dude makes $120 million year needed $5 million taxpayer money keep Yeezy running? Sigh. Fucking hell microscopic view situation without acknowledgement macro world live in. get sick end two failed lungs two failed kidneys blood clots make risky surgery, die, get counted death rate? really predictable manner.

The answer actually yes, counted toward death rate. CDC [guidelines report COVID related certainly account situations like this. least short term. 

Secondly, long term effects severe flu case? Zika? Malaria? infectious disease we've experienced continue experience human race indefinitely? We've functioning flu vaccine since 1940s today 40-60% efficacy rate. Yet still 30,000-80,000 people US die year it. many people suffer lifelong complications consequences surviving severe case? 

To say lack understanding long term effects COVID alone justification draconian measures taken reduce spread completely disregarding fact lots painful, debilitating diseases affect millions people across globe every year without knowing certain long term impacts individual.

Thirdly, case fatality rate means **nothing**. statistic matters infection fatality rate actually measures total number people infected, rather total number people tested. hard gauge many asymptomatic cases many recover go lives reason intention getting tested. Many estimates show IFR ranging depending experts trust. Couple detailed demographic data risks specific populations crystal clear. 

Treating COVID like kind anomaly rather looking raw data comparing disease apples apples manner biased approach result reaching pre-determined conclusions. delusional. evidence lack lawsuits (won lost) manufacturers. n95 around since 72, think dangerous, SOMETHING would've come out? experimental product. probable deaths referring reported *previous* week, week. Meaning week notably far, hence saying unfortunate. God damn miss Tendies. president doesnt power anything constitution works. states tell trump fuck want to. need start locking anyone else danger others around them. guess working chef would make lot less nervous teacher. Good luck you, whatever decide! Percent positive tests also 1.9 2.5, another sign we're declining cases.

I'm still going cautious say need wary post 4th surge- especially Cape photos little disturbing, noticed residents seem super reluctant go public bit, hopefully damage residents tourists minimal. new round? first round end? still testing shortages backlogs? may well save tests people who'd actually something useful result. Jesus beautiful yet despise Umm...what? Asking competency government isn’t asking much. trump administration, sure. still Obama, situation would complete mess currently is. infection numbers death numbers currently unknown.

Until antibody testing possible won’t know many people infected. current guess 10x known infections.

Until excess death numbers looked won’t know many people died. know pneumonia numbers elevated - many probably untested Covid. Also Covid causes blood clots lead fatal heart attacks strokes. Chances people, least beginning, tested nobody knew blood clotting symptom Covid shortage tests. probably get better education Arizona state anyway Mmmm gas station oven food. unfortunate life experience living Florida number years.... hurricane parties evacuations, hands down. 

Hurricanes merciful state. Don’t worry, Disney won’t take Florida ICU beds, they’ll bring back home infect people silent carriers

At least wearing masks? I’m looking silver lining here. fucking now?

Thanks!! Sorry, sorry. used love going Florida, really hope I'll able return near future. way much time really surprised r/china banned. surprised mods r/china also mods stormfront. It’s horrifying. Go read it. Exactly point total tests per capita matter. get it. felt too, got oximeter. tested mask 98% blood oxygen saturation. tested mask 10 minutes feeling thought breath. 98%. feeling might real them, panic, anxiety, claustrophobia. still real feeling, probably lack oxygen. I've worn mask 2 months work 8 hours day. hospital CEOs downplaying this, saying normal ICUs full reassuring community plenty space. 

I smell bs. It’s easy CEO doesn’t leave office say really know what’s going on? 🤔 Here's another one moments matter happened: 

If schools open going deport students student visas even though taking online courses. revenue students make much 1/4 schools budget. reasoning courses online there's reason students country take them. many 400,000 students live countries taking classes online would impossible. schools going open up. president trying reopen Easter, even really shutdown.

You're comparing poor response US's malicious response.

Fuck, trump pulled criticized response worst world. Mexico hands handled 100000x better That’s religious people do. don’t mean shit religious people, look act. Expose semi anonymously. Make sense. today, 1.75x.

Imagine living actually human.  It’s works sometimes. Ex. Small Pox vaccine last 5 years US drops $400m paycheck want come clean? Ok. how-to, making money anything. that's fair. Yeah, pay previous balance lol Absolutely. mean that's kinda people protesting earlier. ""herd immunity"" supposed ""every person infected."" 

The immunity part everyone gets infected. non-infected people immunity spreading. That's ""herd immunity"" is. 

It's like saying HIV, immune HIV! Umm, no, immune - it. Could possible people respiratory conditions simply isolated sooner stricter? I'm asthmatic, I've stepped get grocery deliveries. Neighbors respiratory conditions isolating same. We've freaked since beginning, protecting accordingly. behavior considered factor? Instead, everyone going rush stockpile asthma medication, create shortage. 1990 film *Awakenings* topic. think you’re utterly right. I’m Brazil writing applies perfectly situation here. Shit big time signed for. They're absolutely glowing right now. antibody testing already possible, done place. Yep see tomorrow even more. Rush really big respected Canada? Yes, repeatedly say trust Western press. kind things decide report on, report it, report telling.

This twice China let investigators in. verify human transmission, origins virus.

The narrative West STILL China closed uncooperative allow investigation. Sounds fishy  happened uncle Thanksgiving. nasty cough fever. think cough finally went away January/February, wife ended pneumonia week initial symptoms started up. got shit ton tests done doctor chalked virus allergies gave inhaler deal it.

We're convinced COVID point, us exposed him.

He traveled Germany December so...

Sorry Germany. stores enforce masks? People might reminded put swear never actual problem MD (at least county) school planning this. present lessons person also livestream them. homework &amp; class info portal. think require doctor's note process Rx Orders day, maybe twice month see RX doctor, him/herself. else doctor wife child (they account, tell). say I've never seen controlled substances, usually blood pressure meds, maybe anti-depressant.  stupidest reasoning own. So, flu kills 50k year. COVID nearing triple number 4 months.

Here staggering figures:

 * rate tracking, infect fully **1%** entire population US
 * current infection total **8%** Canada's population 
 * 1/3rd states lower total population total infections US  thought said “other dentists”... whoops. can’t 90 day shutdown without financial assistance all. Unfortunately, don’t think that’s coming. good! put /s end. like crinkle fries sake us US, close permanently please honestly mean treat blacks monolith, believe made clear talked ""inner city black culture."" reason talked well known, also one suffered systemic racism segregation war drugs devastating communities.

There way issue justice comments reddit, especially said, comes including black immigrants.

I well intentioned. honestly support every type criminal justice reform BLM promotes. find rhetoric divisive, refusal let anyone question policies messaging troublesome.

I live one worst hit spots opioid epidemic, lead nation drug overdoses. also large black population well, close major cities. podunk town middle nowhere.

Obviously blacks harder, reforms BLM suggested help everyone. war drugs devastated America, many nations well.

The southern border crisis flood immigrants war drugs destabilized countries, people fleeing drug cartels. Colombia revolution violence half century it.

I know BLM black equality, I'm that, but, opinion, would much successful pointed reforms could make entire world better place. Instead pushing divisive rhetoric.

Thanks calm well thought post. hope America world comes way better off. We're together, believe people want fair shot life, equality. Tornadoes small danger zone though. can't even count number times there's tornado reported within couple dozen miles me, still clear wind am. 
Besides organ transplants, actively suppress immune system, virtually surgeries reduce functionality immune system, increasing chances person end ICU reason, certainly COVID-19 complications specifically still going provide statistics?

Chinese here, confirm this. conspiracy theory actually somehow defensive retaliative Trump tried make us villain instead victim.

But conspiracy theories died quite while, since authority soon started discourages politicization virus social media moderators followed guideline. 

Besides, Trump response virus becomes international joke, social media sentiment towards US changed mocking mode instead angry mode. parents psychopaths holy shit here. wouldn’t want us Canada’s country. don’t think country does, tbh. guys mean offense, current situation leads believe otherwise. ""Flatten curve"" meant ""Infection inevitable want overload hospitals"". absolutely mean one die. unachievable. 0% chance virus ""dies out"" something similar disappears return. 

If anything we've learned fatality statistics led governments lift restrictions earlier. Vulnerable populations identified, overwhelming majority people recover within matter days home require health care resources. black plague touted long term effects totally predictable example adding fear narrative. fear long term effects COVID scares you, true flu virus. Storm Troopers. incredibly concerning real, folks. think somehow invulnerable, can't happen someone circle. 

[This paints picture devastating effects fills knowledge gaps potential long-term consequences coronavirus broadly discussed. Sounds awful lot like pass me.  Yea let's play college football! absolutely terrifying. STILL obtaining herd immunity, painful way. 

When everyone community carries prepped antibody/tcell/bcell response"", virus cannot successfully spread thru population, everyone ""Dead end"". single vulnerable dude within community immunity cannot infected anyone around him, cannot longer catch virus. surrounded ""dead ends"".

**The functional ""immunity"" protection infection vulnerable person has, within immune system rather result inability ""herd"" catch disease spread him, *is called* herd immunity. ONE way attain herd immunity thru vaccination. Another way obtain herd immunity protect community innoculation early age disease well-tolerated children.**

the second way mention BRUTAL disease novel, everyone older ideal age build immune response insulation established immune population. immunity, must either avoid disease die risk much severe illness. Whooshed cake day. hate see it. Yet many universities aim everyone back campuses. Madness would great look good highest Tuesday total month. see trending downward week. mean anyone asthma taking extra steps keep safe. asthma best clean sanitize everything touch. Keep away social gatherings. Always wearing mask. keeping away hospitals. 

There people dying virus asthma ones going gatherings etc. See would agree least consider that, explain rising percent positive tests? sure states UK security personnel one proffessions disproportionately affected peak recollection February Japan made inhaled corticosteroids standard part treatment. mild asthma think that's stocked fuck ton Symbicort. found using salbutamol un US stocked that. Fuck I'm going die asthma asshats need buy like hydroxychloroquine. Let's run start finish.

Step one, get Uber way to/from grocery store. wearing highly coveted N95 mask, gloves, goggles, full face shield. store less 5 minutes change gloves exiting store. clean everything exiting Uber/entering home even change clothes every time. show symptoms continue going to/from work.

Step two, get alert Health Department potential exposure Uber. driver infected several days giving ride. need know been.

Step three, provide list places including workplace job sites worked on. 

Step four, contact work place, client company, client company's workers, client's executive leadership, etc. 

Step five, client company's leadership works distance **COVID-19** suspending contract workplace 'until develop better safety procedures'. 

I disrupted workplace, cost important client, branded workplace place brings **COVID-19**, etc. may fire immediately, let go first possible opportunity. plenty cover millions losing jobs every month. 

tl;dr call landscaping company. Contact tracers called 10 friends workers brought **COVID-19**  Well, you'all certainly raced past us started first. win.

If ask me, people like utterly incomprehensibly selfish. Let's say virus huge hoax - really going make difference life wear mask get take instead dining in? course not, ""giving in"" ""muh freedoms"" whatever garbage come with. understand things simply unavoidable - that's fine. everyone completely socially isolate themselves. mean go around pretending everything normal, not. Well thats good hear. hoax = ""It affecting immediate family, right now. Therefore exist, us"" Pharma companies like $_$ studies far seemed indicate that:

a) (what said) smokers seemed constitute smaller percentage people hospitalized general public. one observational study though, observed China, Italy &amp; France; and

b) smokers _were_ hospitalized seemed similar outcomes (not worse, said)

Part b account comorbidities -- smoking major cause comorbidities associated negative outcomes, likely _indirectly_ smoking contributes worse outcome people second group (smokers hospitalized)

No study I've seen clarified whether nicotine, far know study observed effect a) snus, vaping, gum etc.

(Pure personal anecdote:

I try follow nicotine data became never-smoked nicotine user early last year, using gum/mints, ADHD. anecdotal result: 

* asthma reduced (also observed studies proven)
* seasonal allergy symptoms less severe &amp; much shorter-lived. basically go away within minutes leaving pollen source. (has speculated, far I've found proven study), and
* I've gone longest period 54 year life without respiratory illness, factor 2 -- last 4 months could obviously attributed social distancing &amp; mask use, practiced quite rigorously since late february (I able find study informed speculation one). note: family members less 8 respiratory illnesses illness-free period socially isolated, lots opportunity catch something)
* I'm definitely mildly ""addicted"" addiction stabilized low level nicotine: 3-5 1mg mints / day. started 2mg gum &amp; switched strong. (lots studies show mints/gum significantly less addictive smoking/chewing/vaping/snus)

My personal theory possibly many ""respiratory illnesses"" actually asthma-exacerbated immune over-responses allergies viruses would otherwise asymptomatic nearly asymptomatic. previously common last years need corticosteroids fully recover ""cold"".

I welcome links relevant studies support support above) nothing new. Restaurants always significantly higher profit margins beverage sales. I’ve told sit dining, 10% profit margin food usually well. Beverage sales profit margin 40-50%+. Driving lemmings right cliff. Lots new jobs. lot testing now, thus lot missed cases NY back April. hard compare numbers. 

But give one two weeks, places like CA, AZ, TX, FL probably showing NY-like numbers least far hospitalizations go... Bullshit. hellbent spreading HIV much possible already know it. That's knowingly giving someone HIV infected felony. saving 1/3 people would otherwise die

...from lung symptoms due inflammation tissues there.

Unfortunately, SARS-CoV-2 attacks lot tissues that. suspect we'll eventually find (after years) half people die die ARDS, many others die blood clots internal organs destroyed. ""Really good"" seems like understatement, really good. Well need nuclear bombs destroy themselves. countries laughing fact actually anything (ok want say CHINA gave virus, whole world got US badly affected far \*hint Brazil\*) get America path destruction. think like - can't believe actually took bring US down.

Edit: asked rich guy could afford chauffeur afforded special privilege agianst traffic tickets Re: terrestrial movement, I’m saying it’s much easier control gets country fly in. I’m saying people illegally crossing US borders, think state like it’s country, unmitigated terrestrial border crossings. States lot like separate countries health departments, regulations, decisions whether lockdown, etc., they’re obviously like countries can’t close borders. (This comparing US Europe, much better S.Korea, still apples apples comparison.)

The social cohesion thing plain true. wife immigrated South Korea. I’ve visited many times. stating typical American’s views following governmental orders maintaining social cohesion similar typical South Koreans, poppycock. 

Listen, I’m stating US good job - quite opposite! I’m saying you’re going compare it’s response countries, picking “island” nation much higher social cohesion US disingenuous. might feel naked without mask. ammunition used campaign preventative measures is, mostly, statistics. may missing something, assuming vaccine available everyone wants (a big assumption) people we'd worry people can't get vaccinated. We're stuck old antivax problem that's nothing compared we're dealing now. Mid August typical MS too. Second semester ends mid may. think ended 11. True got lots guns lots hatred it’s dangerous combo  you’re cool then? problem is, deaths slowed briefly right thing. decided ignore logic say fuckit, infections basically lead deaths.... 2-4 week delay infection death.... yea, 50,000 infections day, quite deaths lined queue.... it’s matter waiting point. good person can't wait people like feel ashamed say shit loud again.

If cite source happy see it. previous statistic read, broken countries ancestry, Japanese women statistically likely date non-Asians, percentage even half (if memory recalls mid 30%'s). Others &lt;20%.


It's possible people's views skewed depending geographical location. Imagine grew Asian middle Oklahoma. Well, likely date White folks Asians, Asians around. I've lived, see mostly Asian couples. Hurricanes little hard ignore people coastal areas (and even mainland) pretty familiar effects regularly covered media. Even believe science hurricanes can't deny existence effect whole region pretty dramatic visual. respiratory virus like SARS-COV-2 hand different. invisible causes symptoms similar known diseases. layperson rely completely scientists regarding existence prevent spreading. Hence easier spread false propaganda compared hurricanes. also help virus new lot things still unknown often established scientists get wrong (like initial HCQ trial France) spreads confusion conspiracy theories. Meanwhile. told friend might go mutual friend's wedding 2 weeks (in Texas). response? ""Wear mask bro."" Yet calling flu... refusing wear masks 20 years may find life expectancy drops 5+ years....

So scary people care. long get haircut go bar!!!! I'm trying say joke people used say deadly drive car get covid back May. always are. babysitters this...then became heroes parents see shit deal teach kids...and back babysitters. exploring career options. bullshit. 2nd wave first over? would like add history planet exactly 7 months experience virus do, matter direction mutate next. I'm sorry point would seem moron tell state serious trouble. number new case keeps going up, there's transparency regards hospitalizations (which unofficially going up; impossible new cases young. Right?) death rate follow weeks come. 4th July cases start poping positive lag hospitilizations week two followed by......... senselessly sad totally avoidable. Headline clunky as. 

Is data trend positive (yay) data trending positively (boo)? shop T&amp;T Asian super market Ottawa they've requiring masks since least may. Sure, let's build bombs since that's rational thing do! like enough destroy world couple times. 18,000 new infected Saturday Tuesday.

18,000 new infected 4 days. Probably cases Wuhan closed spread silently Part issue people need prepare. I’m sure people want stock things 35 day lockdown. announce one day many stuck without things need. Need include resurrections get accurate death count. wish best Coronavirus wild virus sure.

Heard many people different symptoms (intestines, toothache, whatever) tested positive Coronavirus.

I wonder that's coincidence(of different illnesses occur time) certainly caused virus? used lurk bit forum back near beginning this.

I recall lots posts ridiculing 'doomers', people ridiculing idea 10's thousands Americans could die. wondrous place never seeeeeen... news article couple months ago reporter went large upscale outdoor mall outside Atlanta shortly reopened talk people about. one large group interviewed asked felt safe gathering large group public, one guys answered saying well, saw statistics dying, knew safe. That’s came area. less chance interacting people might carrying it. group laughed laughed. thinly veiled racism entitled sickening read. Stop florida man, bath salts cure covid.  We’re screwed. weekend numbers really low, today catching up. We’re still week week. We’re week 7 spike cases current hotspots deaths gone around 25%, all, states. 

It’s going get worse gets better, it’s going get back bad April, long shot. I'm it.

It REALLY needs driven home completely fucked country right now, set adrift malicious ""leadership."" absolutely one lowest point history.

Bring articles, remind snowflakes shit voted for. Agreed. Even admitted could anywhere 20 100 times number coronavirus cases worldwide taking account mild symptoms asymptomatic cases. flu immunity actually wear year prevalent strains mutate enough every year needs slightly tweaked recipe? Shhh don’t try use logic here. They’ve waiting people die score political points since Memorial Day.... country replete selfish, whiny , stupid assholes less critical thinking caveman. fact number tests going seems overlooked everyone. states finally rolling open public testing without requiring preconditions. 

Oddly, knowing people positive one seems notice means death rate continues going could predicted ? always, tests become much available country many places get test without symptoms least situations. former coworker recently tested without symptoms rest family illness sure enough asymptomatic. friend works firefighter gets tested every week along rest department regardless symptoms. course asymptomatic people get tested neither symptomatic people. Sorry bro, simply believe given data presented fact number cases still rising day. Unlike China, said stopped everything A-OK.   250 missing Saturday. 512 vs 265.  policy clearly part Trump's policy restricting immigration please voters

As Chinese person really can't understand President United States nothing burning fire house (the important problem world solve), instead makes plan make friends come house.

Who would want go America time? road death? please, majority Americans stocks? 

Yes do. I'm one said Fed nothing common man, get upset move goal posts instead admitting misspoke. break, people truly benefiting booming stock market elites wise average folk, vase majority counted ""owning stocks"" access gains.'

The rich definitely benefit securities, flat wrong. Anyone regularly contributes 401K/IRA benefits stocks up. tens millions gamble savings away SPY puts, I'd probably counted ""stock owner"" well since 2 shares AMZN. Yippee!! finances secure fucking AMZN massive bubble, great.

Literally nothing point, childish rhetoric points hard? people read article. sheriffs enforcing law lacks teeth take action arresting people refuse wear mask. give fine allowed take arrest them. also urgent issues hand want call centers flooded average Joe wearing mask. Likely officers enforce law get pulled breaking another law. 

Now two cents. 
They enforce law person take 911 calls it. let's face it. takes average 30mins hour officer respond non emergency 911 call. Oh got fender bender everyone ok? Good 30 mins. Apply random guy walking around long gone. 
FYI got car accident serious told 30 mins. Took cop hour something urgent came up. twist completely unrelated virus. want close border. Sounds like time student strike  I'm NYC indoor dining since March, roll back anything can’t blame them. cases all. Maybe fewer daily infections perhaps? total number ACTIVE cases continued increase. [data told business days. Got mine last Tuesday still haven’t gotten results  no, catch home, either, everyone staying inside home. 

Was someone giving advice stay inside bar something? Thank service.

I contracted covid provided home customer service contractor nurse working shifts two different hospitals. routine remove clothing head straight shower gets home. masked up, washed hands, kept ample spacing her. two us there, got person didn't. calls help again, gladly go. idea even lost game hide seek, game heavily stacked favor covid. able smell vinegar, coffee, fingernail polish 24 hours weird experience.

I also cut emergency operations understand different groups working together common cause. One team, one fight. Mutual aid agreements made well emergency calls cooperation. problem state sending person another state receive care need. grateful systems exists thought even CNN wants take opportunity drag people mud it.

I one less person needing help hospital one less person spread virus near future, one person provide antibodies, sooner get back new normal life. 

CNN fear mongering. providing helpful dialogue people make informed decisions. simply running headlines end goal stir pot create drama.

Again, thank service. Heh, call “map Tasmania”. Google told 14000 deaths 6 July us Covid. That's insane. correct temp error accounting?

Scary times. Bro she’s alright she’s laying next rn way ACA it? talking Medicaid expansion, sure, let's keep that. worked well, even Republican governed states initially resisted portions bill expanded Medicaid gravy train (with Republican asterisks, course). Note Medicaid still part boogieman socialized medicine Republicans mainstream Democrats keep relentlessly shamelessly fearmongering about.

The exchanges, though, worked promised, that's unsaid reason House Democrats attempting push COBRA exchange subsidies - even can't make case ACA exchanges anymore. pass legislation chase Silver gaps want, going get people better rates better actuarial value plans insurance companies going worm way of.

That said, M4A would sufficient either. like Medicare A/B really enough cover medical expenses aged private Medigap marketplaces proliferated (and created entire companies! especially servicing wealthy people afford it!), M4A regular citizens would still likely build supplemental insurance market wealthy citizens still solve broader health care issues. would it, alone, solve cost control problems require someone say ""No"" unproven well-marketed avenues care requested understandably desperate patients.

But talking point ACA disingenuous, period. nothing addressing Coronavirus, nothing content article barest mentions end-of-life care planning. good movie. watch school. Back 90’s 😭 I’m old 😂 crucify many deaths people likely die near future number potential causes? Citation?

Wonder everyone posting realizes PPP loan program strict guidelines. Loan amounts based calculation companies pre COVID payroll avg period time. original terms 75% go pay employees payroll Related expenses get unemployment 25% allowed facility expenses rent, mortgages, utilities etc.... spent 8 week period. later terms changed 60/40 payroll/other approved expenses 24 weeks.  


There also terms requirements staff payroll making $100k. Payroll records receipts turned in. think lot people think money went company general fund use however wanted.  


I know, exec director nonprofit. PPP absolutely saved us. furloughed almost 100 staff received loan nearly 200k. $160k went payroll furloughed staff rest went building expenses. 

I absolutely agreeing organizations abused /are easily well enough cash flow didn’t need also know received money use approved items. makes think SK Germany honest Japan isn't?

 Effectively eliminated polio.


 This. Whenever talk this, people respond much would cost. won’t need bail companies businesses families guaranteed basic income... Still riding first one baby. helluva ride. end?!? tiring. America wtf far understand, actual science part isn’t reduced all. phase still held standard every vaccine. real risk financial accelerated timeline. Florida resident, I'd like know heck we're gonna Cat 3-5 hurricane hits us, especially we've got Covid-19 positive people popping damn place. :/ 

My county requires anyone coast Cat 2 plus shelter elsewhere. gotta scrunch together, coughing wheezing fresh air power out? people travel 2-4 states away stay couple days extra. Florida man already planning next round crazy y'all. 🤦‍♀️ 

Fffff--we doomed. Terror Denial. Make humans dangerous CRNA doctorate degree Ok, literally mind.

It's pretty commonly accepted fact 10% cases even reported. means vast majority cases mild, people even \*know\* it.

For symptoms, vast majority experience cold flu-like symptoms 1 2 weeks.

THEN, there's small minority become seriously ill and/or need hospitalization, etc.

Do HONESTLY believe 45% people need longterm care something 0.26-0.4% mortality rate?

Sorry... ... LOLLLLLLLLL. Eliminated smallpox. Effectively eliminate much much more. That's low hanging fruit helped everyone planet. leader gotten way. I’m boat. old kids? Worth remembering evaluating numbers Florida.

“Florida publish testing, case condition data people county/local jails, state prisons, migrant communities, cumulative totals testing cases long-term care facilities, probable cases deaths testing available, non-resident data zip code city level.”

From Also, don’t know sure it’s restaurants. Ice cream sales good predictor drowning rates. 

Here, summer economy opening similar. exactly arguing here? Canada densely populated US (your 3/8 one province figure) better handle virus? less densely populated (the Alaska comparison) making containment easier?  They’re directly caused virus. Bacterial infections quickly move lungs colon cause serious issues.  knowingly spread false information research suggested time? 

The whole reason things shut quickly NOVEL virus know next nothing about. think might backward: pass law matter unconstitutional it'll stand goes front court. There's nothing unconstitutional forcing positive people stay home per se, could run constitutional issues depending enforcement, access food, etc. Perm organ damage, neurological damage mention lower life expectancy.  Stop pushing bullshit. you; don’t let try take away freedoms. mother Karen’s tests potential generate false negatives, research say nasal type less accurate full swabs. full swabs 80% accurate best day (3 days post symptom onset), nasal swabs less accurate people lower viral load, see /r/COVID19/comments/hfkbzb/nasalswab_testing_misses_patients_with_low/ Basically lot virus body nasal swab probably find it, test negative, still act like might contagious test result may false negative. people died streets Wuhan. need argument whether people die literally streets homes. update, likely exposed last week, informed today it. evening inviting dinner refuse. Forever... Chinese nationality comprised several different ethnic groups. Calling “race” example orientalist revisionism Asian ethnic diversity. It’s racist say fuck Americans fuck British. Faulting choose apathetic face country wrong perfectly reasonable. nothing ethnicity. genetic background nothing I’m saying fuck Chinese.

Let’s overplay racism card defense people overtly reliably racist. They’re currently committing genocide ethnic grounds. don’t drag million people community without least tacit support people generally. Covid first broke wouldn’t let black people stores malls. man... really don’t want hear Chinese feel Asians. Also, Disneyworld opens July 11 time Wuhan untraceable.

They opted reporting + mass centralized isolation treatment, community workers knocked door house register report addition, confirmed patients advised enter hospital. (serious cases admitted specialized hospitals minor cases admitted converted centralized hospitals gymnasiums), suspected patients, infections cannot excluded. Potentially febrile patients enter fever clinic, close contacts clustered isolated home, always reported

The fact hard find bed Wuhan time, everyone tried cooperate procedure (although initial misgivings converted centralized admission hospitals stadium), least procedure seemed clear, health care workers took social media urge everyone cooperate, especially centralized admission hospitals, decisive reversal effect: separating sick healthy breaking chain transmission.""If disease, treat early avoid spreading family, whole society work together eliminate COVID-19"" become social consensus.

The system set academician Wang Chen, (a member Chinese Academy Engineering expert respiratory critical care medicine) whole set measures published April 2 Lancet, leading British medical ever say ""China warn you"" again, Chinese even wrote paper English hand published top medical journals. Like honestly. shocked point? 23,218 / 134,000 = one-third (Reddit math). Underrated comment. Fuck Kanye. Pretentious prick. curious - apply first place? PUA rules pretty lenient allowing people whose jobs affected pandemic (reduced earnings included) get unemployment beautiful $600 extra week Folks like stubborn learn. That's okay, figure later life realize wasted decades toiling needlessly. calling others trolls, stand yourself. Defend ypur arguments, substantiate proof spread every rural area seem suggest. friend lives states wife n 6 month old live Saskatchewan. Sucks, hasn’t seen kid since December. parents haven’t seen newest child since day born (they left next day Nov). miss like crazy hurts sometimes thinking long it’s it’s worth risk. They’d cross two provinces see us self isolate 14 days. know one day see don’t want responsible another possible outbreak! Oh new talking point replace whole ""there infections testing things fine"" bullshit? matter deaths classified initially end result same.  matter people try pretty bad situation get better people start accepting situation is.  That's interesting I've always used fitbit indicator I'm coming anything, covid . resting HR around 55, I'm getting ill spike 65 couple days prior coming something.

I'm often ill times years accurately diagnosed pending illness. Reminder BLM spread covid protesters complicit deaths innocent people. racist there? almost sounds like people *want* others die. BUILD WALL!! neighbor South pay it! ;-) unemployment runs August 1st no, indications it'll extended. yeah. Someone posing photo. whole composition lazy top. Terrible photography. Many also lobbied pressured get states reopen early, botched reaping sowed.

If thought past 2nd quarter earnings, might realized taking hit controlling Covid means get back making profit sooner. government knows best decide fine go out, wear masks, lock down, go restaurants/bars, go schools gyms, etc.

If really lived period know people adhere (and still adhering) quite strict recommendations despite recommendations. make sound people continued lives usual true. It’s anecdote turned fact journalists kept repeating it. 

Regarding lockdown might want think panic measure beneficial parts countries. action forced EU create recovery fund € 750 billion. money must paid back system next pandemic hits us, come frequently increasing population world otherwise can’t expect people put debt every pandemic. 

Now EU wants Sweden puts € 20 billion fund receive € 5 billion back corona support. support countries performed hard lockdown end approximately death rates Sweden. hard understand fund popular among Swedes. I've even job required doctor's note sick job provide health insurance. fun dilemma. Even coronavirus want around stoners. Yes, heaven forbid private citizens avenues legal recourse government. everyone gets retested ensure they’re negative going back public. CDC specific guidelines based time course diagnosis symptoms recommend person likely safe return work makes sense older kids, younger kids? Parents going back work even working home also essentially homeschooling 1st graders? remotely feasible. basically option becomes...send somewhere one parent quitting job. NY times piece days ago...parents young kids job kids, pandemic. started shifting couple days ago Trump saying thing: ""America lowest death rate world decreasing!"" death rate = today's deaths divided today's cases. course, guaranteed way keep ratio low make sure cases going bit Ponzi scheme. lot people ( reporter) still think respiratory illness?  vascular illness affects entire body! (well almost )

I find type reporting bad general. get clicks ads! 

Between Media pushing bad information/misleading information, someone pushing narrative confuse divide everyone. Like needed science-negationists crazier already are... deaths infectious diseases. Look, crisis actor! 50k cases yesterday? U.S. deaths end year could hit 200K+.

I hope low. Californians’ attitudes whether shelter-in-place orders relaxed soon shifting — jumping 43% June 19 53% new survey. latest CHCF poll, 27% residents said pace “just right,” 18% think order relaxed “too Seventy-one percent Black people think state reopening quickly, significantly higher share Latinos (51%) whites Researchers found 85% Latinos, disproportionately affected COVID-19, least “somewhat” concerned, 61% saying “very concerned.” Ninety percent Asians said concerned contracting virus.

Lamb meatballs

Meatballs variety great boat food, although heavy weather might want eat bowl rather plate because, well, round. I’m going address lamb meatballs techniques apply beef even fish meatballs. easy too.
If cruising pay attention going. you’re US East Coast cruiser heading Bahamas, example, little point buying lamb US feed freezer. lamb better cheaper Bahamas. ask? Good question. UK-associated country gets surplus New Zealand British lamb, good, low subsidized prices. places feed freezer lamb. 
There two keys really good meatballs. First simple. sure size. manage spoon. manage ice cream scoop scraped side lip mixing bowl. specialized tools look like big melon ballers specifically task (and making cookies) don’t make enough meatballs cookies justify gadget. use ice scream scoop scraped lamb meatballs. big meatballs (like spaghetti meatballs) load scoop. small meatballs like Swedish meatballs potluck (more later) use melon baller (which useful many things earns place aboard). second important key roast meatballs. cook meatballs skillet shouldn’t. Roasting oven requires less contact time part. also contains splatter (which less oven anyway) reduces clean significantly. 
Let’s make lamb meatballs.
Into large bowl (a BIG one you’ll mixing hands) goes pound ground lamb, large yellow onion finely diced, two cloves garlic finely minced, zest one lemon dash prepared lemon juice, ½ cup fresh parsley chopped. grate onion garlic fine dice mince takes long. Alternatively watch human Cuisinart action practice. See . reap dividends passage passage, anchorage anchorage. truly substitute knife skills. Really. promise. Remember great cooking centuries food processors, blenders, electric kitchen appliances. Add spices: couple teaspoons cumin, teaspoon dried oregano, ¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper, pinch salt, healthy grinds pepper. add bit crushed red pepper flakes like. 
Coat hands little olive oil (a teaspoon plenty) mix everything. lamb dry little freezer burned add lightly beaten egg binder. Remember freezer burn dried food (like jerky) won’t hurt you. find helps let mixed meat rest bit bung bowl fridge make sauce prep whatever else menu. check maneuver big mixing bowl fridge you? We’ll get back meatballs bit. 
There number choices sauce. easy boat friendly. 
Tzatziki sauce simple yogurt based sauce. Grate finely dice large cucumber. Add tablespoon olive oil one lemon juice. pinch salt, mint dill find two cups Greek yogurt. Remember making yogurt super simple. 
Mix everything refrigerate you’re ready it. cucumber really make difference you’re 600 miles land mix yogurt, lemon, oil declare success. Shhh. Don’t tell. dried dill mint green flecks fool everyone. 
Avocado sauce cruising sub-tropics near good shopping good alternative. Halve dice avocado bowl. Mash fork. Add ½ cup plain Greek yogurt, much fresh cilantro find (a cup, unless genetic marker makes cilantro taste like soap case sympathy use parsley), seeded hot pepper like jalapeno finely dinced minced, tablespoon lemon juice cumin. Dash salt grinds pepper. Mix together avocado fork. 
For something taste Swedish meatballs you’ll make Béchamel. little bit last minute prep like pan sauces Thanksgiving. Don’t let vocabulary scare you. hand, don’t shy offering Swedish meatballs Béchamel la Auspicious. substitute boat name you’re good. halfway Bermuda St Martin wedged tossing galley Avalon anchorage Catalina Island. certain age remember Martin Yan “Yan Cook” indeed say way purpose. 
All scrapings cooked meatballs (below) go pan. Add enough fat (oil butter combination get ¼ cup. Add ¼ cup fat stir well combined doesn’t smell like raw flour. called roux opens end French, Cajun, Creole cooking. Slowly pour cup dairy whisking like mad. takes 30 seconds (to pour) minute (to mixed thoroughly). Béchamel, one French mother sauces. See? wasn’t hard all. season dollop soy sauce teaspoon Dijon mustard. Salt (go easy) pepper (be liberal). You’ll amazed thick becomes. It’s great sauce. 
I scored bunch tomatoes (a bunch technical term “a lot” – case five pounds). Side dishes us tonight Caprese salad leftover potato salad. Lamb meatballs go well green beans peas carrots glazed carrots. Hasselback potatoes look fancy, taste great, fast easy long watched Jacques Pépin video linked couple chopsticks. Hummus bread another good side.
Now turn back meatballs. Pull meat fridge makes room anything else you’ve prepped. Prep baking tray. love quarter sheet pans. inexpensive, widely available, fit boat ovens. aren’t planning roux-based sauce use parchment paper pan. Wherever stock plastic wrap aluminum foil find parchment paper. Use ice cream scoop capture meat bowl scrape rim side mixing bowl level off. Remember consistency important exact measurements. ice cream scoops release hoop easiest use anything. Pop meat hand use hands make ball. doesn’t perfect less handling better. Overworking meat make dry rubbery cooked. Get close. think need touch one time, don’t. You’re done. goes sheet pan move next meatball. Lather, rinse, repeat. 
These get cooked hot oven. goal 425F talking boat ovens, hot get. cook sheet pan many log-style cockpit grills. Cook time 20 minutes, turning meatballs halfway through. Solid cooking tongs big help. Trying forks spoons exercise frustration. Get tongs. They’re cheap. Spatulas don’t work well application either. Tongs. Important: even offshore sea you’ll want lock cooker opening oven door turn take meatballs out. weight door put sheet pan meatballs cabin sole. You’ll end cold Pop-Tarts dinner. 
Meatballs, especially small ones, great appetizer potluck contribution. It’s nice keep warm certainly wrap towels around bowl dinghy ride. However, happen things game. carry slow cooker. electrical system handle relatively light load hands-off cooking nice. addition big boat inverter couple small 300W inverters carry deliveries sometimes. outboard electric start well pull start small motorcycle start battery that. Motorcycle batter plus inverter plus slow cooker means take meatballs beach dinghy keep warm picnic tables potluck. “Auspicious portable slow cooker” works great Louisiana red beans &amp; rice pigs blanket. Best never worry someone walking bowl platter. Upvotes feed family! Pretty much red meat. 
I've trying coupon everything else. crazy. Time rewatch masterpiece evil triumphing greater evil. end hospital COVID, something else? Since pandemic, latest stat I've seen says increased 92% top 10%--with top 1% owning 50% stock overall. Trump 2020: Put Children Back Factories! Thanks well wishes. stole it.

Phase 3 opening began June 22. Phase 3 allows lot indoor activities. 

 

You almost see coronavirus transmission pic article. know Covid likely airborne, indoor activities arent safe. keep trying anyway. results. state (NY) started phase Monday July 3. Expect spike soon. stores require masks MUST provide alternate shopping method. Trump decides punish Greater Toronto Area That, positives based person's residence record, tested potentially contracted it. doubt we're exporting cases tourists come go. Almost none guidelines followed east coast, even gyms open. Considering number outbreaks started Churches, miracle yet figured God ""protecting"" Coronavirus sense.

This said many responsible Churches still conducting services online, ones believe God wants safe live long life. No, mean people mocking doubting would spike cases 2 weeks, thinking won’t really spread. I'll add also obvious individuals positions power within corporations still need onsite; presence important, need present assist day day operations. STOP KNUCKLEHEAD -- WEAR MASK like sound timeline it’s sounds like fantasy timeline compared experiencing. wouldn’t surprised people dying home, especially save families crippling medical debt.

That’s decision society require people make. Especially none western societies proud Christian roots. happened loving neighbor helping need? Sad sickening. No...see, that's point, people even animal brains 😁 True. I'm sure possess power decide whether speech rises dangerous level enough justify stopping it. Certainly violent threats do, posters want wear masks directly threatening anyone. They'll likely thrown businesses wearing mask.

I think censorship bad idea, especially marketplace ideas mask deniers failing anyway without help. small minority unlikely garner support people.

I agree them, want see censorship either. difficult line walk, considering stakes high.  No, well don’t think so. looking outdoor research’s masks come disposable filters Yea understanding well high pneumonia count correlate COVID deaths. Anyone pneumonia deaths test positive Corona listed death categories. guess missing piece information ""how many pneumonia deaths tested Corona all?"" would helpful data. Oh no, boogeyman county TN started mask mandate yet good amount Walmart employees weren’t even wearing them. Mostly around necks.  coronavirus scary respiratory virus 2009 H1N1 ""Swine Flu"" mostly effected younger adults (but well contained)

Also, good luck stuffing COVID-19 back Pandora's box, state full Florida Man. Ignore biology medicine risk. Yeah, hundreds billions upon billions injected markets, hundreds billions loans grants business. Schools need 250 billion reopen safely across entire nation? Well, fuck them! dog would’ve handled better They're going 0 beds long August 7th. Like, next week.

They converting hotels rooms ICUs, already. not. understand school administrators hope gain reopening. campus closed end March, successfully moved classes online, we're reopening daily records hospitalizations deaths state. work university, feel K-12 administrators university administrators willfully ignoring data. Actually extent. 2k cases many deaths backlog July2-5.

Still bad getting worse though. really frustrating. We're talking ward council reopening Sunday meetings. I'm continually disappointed many take seriously. real kicker people vocal returning church healthcare professionals. insane. Let god heal then.  heard lot of, ""Let's over-react"". Ummm...........like, over-reaction miles better under-reaction. 

People stupid. love blackface That's good, uh, did. definitely dont think they're average Christian. Went Christian churches life lot less weird. saying New Testament easily criticized one wanted that. saying bible true, easy people nitpick problematic things. still don’t get urgency. easily practice religion home safe. perspective God wherever accept him, even home, it’s respect neighbors. karma greedy thinking god protect bs. Religion sometimes feel toxic destructive. 1) can't cut funding already authorized.  would coronavirus specific extra funds get withheld. 

2) Try getting teachers they're comfortable doing, nation wide. NEA AFT already fought state plenty places (even striking theoretically illegal.) Teachers unions one unions US real power.

Teachers want teach, they're going put non-evidence based unsafe bullshit, president wants to. I'll guess president pure id unable consistent even mind. 

Was president meeting everyone impression rational response covid response agreed upon change mind talking press? Totally believable. Now, I'm much support protests, see natural sociological phenomenon emergent material conditions black people America. also care religion. However, I'm trouble morally logically justifying protests midst pandemic whilst simultaneously keeping people things seem much less conducive spreading virus, church. Could someone clear little bit? Thank you.

Edit: Stop downvoting me, I'm literally asking question argue idiots bring comparison competence. wait till headline readers get grandstanding bs move something else get offended :P 😂😂😂

It sounds like assessment situation month two date, you’re nasty surprise look current hospital capacity Texas, Florida Arizona. Well duh Hmm think must watching different protests? exactly many masks except typical press release close ups.
And infection rate protest exactly clear trace church. clear obvious double standards here, matter unpopular opinion is. There's lots county-level data place. break CA several areas, LA Imperial really bad. San Diego pretty bad. North essentially unaffected (but also tiny population) bay area really well climbing alarmingly. expect talking point age like milk. Businesses could help, too. Walmart require masks stores yet? biggest grocer America took stand couldn’t come inside without mask, regardless local law, would much big city mayor Florida curb thing. mean I’ve ordered maybe 20 masks online. longest one first order ( dozen masks employees right Covid started) took little week. others arrived within week. need mask isn’t going anywhere soon, reason ordering one today “it take long” - doesn’t make sense feel option. Grain bins cleaned month Passover grains cleaned taking mill grinding. would greatly reduced rat population around farms less grain eat. one things we're number one cause celebration Please scream inside heart. 🤣 pretty sure care donation bowl getting passed around.  think would sounds like Trump started disregard supporters think Fauci full shit actual fake news propaganda.

The US dealing second epidemic deals information truth. Half country associates bias falsity associates self-affirmation truth. No? left high school deal remote learning 2 months. little sister brother aswell. Trumpster Fire Chief remove need certification executive order. Problem_solved_Job_Done_Mission_Accomplished.jpg. /s like every cold flu.

No, thousands years experience colds unless transition something else serious (like pneumonia) people recover without issues.

Flu another story least lot history dealing humans degree immunity hospitals literally full close full? Without sounding synodical deaths low? Everyone ICU walking happy week? 🤷🏻‍♂️

I’m UK, can’t speak shining example think numbers reported far accurate regardless pandemic makes us ‘look bad’. purposely stupid toddlers do. Please read article. entire counties Florida 0 available ICU beds. 84% entire state full. winter flu season averages, full summer. true. one follow south. Look texas. law enforcement refuse enforce #defundjesus Starting Labor day stupid thing ever happen country. really make sense though drink home afford buy 4 bottles vodka instead one.

I guess social pressure enormous effect consumption. Amazon retailers deliver there? agreement needed keep employees end September. it’s October 1 start laying people make health laws part parcel faith... case thr Kosher sages also point various advantages kosher laws: health benefits, humane treatment animals, unifying effect dispersed people, role shield assimilation. 

Additionally, Nachmanides, great 12th century sage kabbalist, points “the birds many mammals forbidden Torah predators, permitted animals not; instructed eat animals, absorb qualities ourselves.” Kashrut (kosher laws) thus seen “spiritual nutrition.” 

Just foods good body foods harmful, foods nourish Jewish soul foods affect adversely. ...] chance . Coming #1 per capita spot. LOOK AMERICA #1 let open get rid harm taken. two way street hard navigate people heading different directions. It'd great err side safety, always plays out. [Florida ICU beds census listed county facility issue treating nutrition like acute medical intervention particular outcome something need maintain whole life. Eat nothing hot dogs potato chips adulthood amount multivitamins able reverse kind damage done horrific diet. would bet dollar churches ignore Covid mostly evangelical minister owns church proceeds go directly making preacher rich. Normal churches congregation owns church hires preacher would much less motivated promise personal profit evangelicals running church personal business would.

Looking straight millionaire prosperity preachers. going church mandatory part going heaven?

It varies church church.

Which, like science, would indicate theory fully baked. sayin'. wish could post photo, live AZ pest control, essential work group apparently I’m sitting parking lot outside Bashas Maricopa don’t see single person wearing mask, it’s also 114 degrees right now. Everything open. one cares here. It’s disappointing. USA number 1 greatest covid-dominated country World :D seems anti-science bias US. deny validity science better fit in. 😂😂😂

Covid-19 even scariest thing people seen year.

If virus serious deadly demographics sure given mild really concern people regardless spreads.

Hence many people enjoying life usual. I'd like see deaths overall compared rather one place. people working home significantly going amount places die normal causes decreases dramatically. doubt significant number unconfirmed covid deaths occurring, like statistic. highschool 4.3k students facility meant 1.7. senior year second one built near moved good portion sophomore incoming freshman school reducing crowding 650 students past capacity. Sounds good. going staff them? ICU nurses CA, TX, FL? people clearly Wal Mart. filters probably either charcoal sort resin attracts holds contaminates. Similar filter Brita water pitcher. basically get ""filled"" whatever collect stop good collecting new stuff. Whatever collected may longer viable virus whatever it'll still physically there. tired ""wInNinG"" whole ""it's Flu Bro"" crowd.

Sadly, still break another record tomorrow, next week, next month next whatever. Ok. 650 cases outbreak.... many hundreds thousands? churches fact close majority pandemic. ones reopening (from I’ve seen) areas aren’t hotspots, compliance restrictions business gathering place (or strict cases). can’t call something “major source” it’s less 1% cause.  Yeah that’s true numbers, also portion going self quarantine. already told indoor dining. See remains within 100 degree temps high humidity. What’s even terrifying 2 million *active* cases God wants get Covid, I’ll get Covid. God doesn’t want get Covid, won’t.” -- Dan Satterwhite, pastor

Mr. Satterwhite, Lord say something like Son God,” [Satan] said, “throw down. written: ‘He command angels concerning You, lift hands, strike foot stone.’” Jesus replied, “It also written: ‘Do put Lord God test.’” Nope. We’re still talking masks increase toxins unconstitutional honestly know states done anything 'flatten curve'. lockdown delay we'd take hit.

Some states opened aggressively quick. states getting crushed high case amount. 


Some states opened slower, cases count growing...slowly steadily.

I think next big wave states get hit hard colleges open person classes month. Students going return country colleges cities really lot infections...and infect people herd immunity.

ie states closing restaurants indoor dining, know allow college owned operated students campus. Also dont see safe open schools, kids atleast area. Colleges reopening going shift infections are.  Except human behaviour combats virus throws spanner works. would willing believe Farr's law holds constant level social interaction maintained duration pandemic, humans modulating exposure extensive social distancing. Scientific criteria based ""better nothing"". They're based ideas like ""sufficient"" ""necessary"" achieve certain result. woven cloth mask without nosepiece obviously going protect exposure kinds high viral loads cause even healthy people develop severe cases COVID-19 closed spaces infected person, Fauci others telling people go public woven cloth masks. something public health officials tell obviously protective, people actually think hear tell protective, credibility problem. adults society trouble accepting simple fact.

You lie adults expect credibility public. I've quarantined since get go. I've helped others keep quarantined they've needed assistance. cant help everyone facts.... mutually exclusive, also Evangelicals exactly clean either comes abusing kids.  Well, COVID already mutated contagious, necessarily less deadly. virus fine spreading since range illness wide. unlikely evolutionary pressure virus less deadly point. mean weaken, see evidence needs right now. Yup, 2 party system sucks. I've lived US years, amount establishment surrounding two parties absolutely insane. big business! You’re teacher distance teaching? That’s lot cases, jump 50 60 thousand really quick. 

We don’t shit anywhere near control. lockdowns nightmare.

Not virus miniscule fatality rate demographics. Praise Lord


EDIT: Lord Lorf True, look like helps COVID either. saying Vitamin bad, avoided. seems unrelated COVID, far evidence currently suggests.  that's true, wonder orthodox Jews New York disregarded social distancing pleas result becoming one affected groups initial phase pandemic. Sorry, I'm sure ""you guys"" supposed mean. Holiday backlog nothing see here, lowest rates world! really need lock down. compliance social distancing, hand washing, mask wearing. Canadian ninja, eh. Got me. Omg seriously? I'm PA left job couple months ago developed bad anxiety covid. wish someone told that! I'm mad right now. Mass shootings (New Zealand) opened schools back April essential worker’s kids, teachers volunteered school. rest us on-line learning 5 weeks going back full time May restrictions lifted. couldn’t imagine both. time brain energy takes either often underestimated haven’t experienced it. glad got choice. contrast, told Ontario, ""We knowingly put Canadians harms way"". didn't. perfect here, way (WAY) better US. leadership, Washington-based entertainment.  Yeah definitely NOTHING BLM Protests Maybe don’t rally. fucking stupid can’t even believe. Holy shit that's insane. Better risking kind retirement. poor people. There's way they're ever getting tested, nevermind treatment. mean guards. week/week half Mother's Day wife's fingernail started peeling. Like layers coming top like onion. always weak nails assumed diet change thanks sheltering caused it. Thursday Friday skin around fingernails started getting blisters like she'd handling poison ivy. made us really suspicious. 

Then Mother's Day woke nauseous, threw couple times, felt kinda better went breakfast. walked staring bowl cereal. ""I can't taste this.""

Oh, snap.

So get good dose sanitizer hand sniff test. Nope, thing nose curling alcohol smell foot away.

Throughout day got sicker sicker, vomiting. isolated couch wore mask, knew I'd definitely compromised mainly son.

Monday got tested. Wednesday came back negative.

Her fever never went 100 showing additional symptoms like chest felt like belt wrapped around it. typical symptoms, although they're escaping moment.

Friday went clinic flu test. negative doctor recommended consider another test continued feel bad. decided go then. test came back positive.

It three weeks extreme exhaustion, lots sleeping, muscle fatigue, chest pains, etc. Weeks earlier I'd found video doctor showing breathing exercises get try prevent pneumonia, 3 4 times day getting progressively harder do. 

On week 3 went ER wheeze chest getting worse. x-rays exams, determined pneumonia sent home steroid prescription. 

She started getting better feeling okay two weeks. Since then, almost 3 weeks, random fevers intense fatigue spells, especially anything physical, along random bouts coughing might last minute two.

She probably needs take vitamins I've heard eating fish least fish oil pills seems help. Like you, going without caffeine akin going shooting there, morning coffee tea day.

Myself: week Mother's Day, felt like crap. Tired, unable think clearly, unable really wake mornings. associated stress, went away week even got worse definitely got stressed feel issues. got second test asked said there's need chances _not_ low. kinda wish I'd pushed one anyway.

The explosion cases completely wrecked mental health.

Currently, work government hates non-whites, doesn’t know manage business, robbing blind asset stripping. current government full asset strippers money launderers, that’s don’t want healthcare, need go work, don’t want unemployed. 

This government particular cares personal wealth building, business-minded presidents bad, hire shady businessman run business, outcome get. 

If want work company cares people, hire Democrat. still shady shit, least benefit package bit sweeter. Stonks go up... somehow along Covid cases. 1. don’t drink much bar goes

It's likely I'm county 2 things. low amount cases (264) lot of... uhhh, let's call anti-maskers. still lot Americans value education would like see country become world leader science again.

The system broken, fucking rotten core!

We invested trillions everything everyone education , health justice system. worst part nothing change next 20 years Yeah shit. say US correct approach, said measures china took would without question considered ""draconian"" america. fire officials **can’t say certain what’s driving increases**, Senior Capt. Isabel Sky-Eagle said seems tied coronavirus crisis. **Some found dead upon arrival serious underlying health problems** didn’t realize also sick COVID-19, Sky-Eagle said. **Others simply delayed medical care long**, said, possibly they’d seen news reports overburdened said crewmates first noticed people dying paramedics arrived weeks ago, internal data confirmed patients would called us earlier on, waiting long** maybe don’t want transported hospital,” Sky-Eagle said. “Now we’re catching they’re already cardiac arrest, it’s late.” test it, like /s think point fewer people asthma *are getting* virus asthma among co-morbidity conditions seems common  people requiring hospitalization. (hypertension, obesity, heart problems).

This question occurred well, would suspect asthma right top danger list, asthmatics get virus show rate recovery better average.

Edit: oh, happy cake day! Blow candles one around ;-} die die gods good 70-80% people get infected reach herd-immunity great 20-30% don't. snowflakes victims accuse everybody else being. projection vile lunatics. can't reach across aisle them. world would better without them. No, I'm saying solution curbing spread virus national level. local level still useful protect communities at-risk groups.

To curb spread, effective lockdowns need employed. US rich country yet unable get first peak national level. despite done tests per capita rich countries. suggests solution stopping virus showing.

At point likely larger percentage states going infected point next 12 months, regardless testing. Well groups riding around drunk shit. one people. check post history interested going back far enough. terribly wrong. unemployed first time life, scared.

Deaths lag cases. Well weeks since surge began death surge come. many deaths reported covid related ICU full non covid patients SOL?

Every person dies room ICU listed covid cause can't know they'd live die using emergency battlefield care triage hospitals.

I assume average yearly deaths America greater 2 - 3 times normal that's less accidents lock downs.

Maybe counters tangentially related deaths covid even lockdown cause deaths ( mental health/suicides), I'm stat nerd curious numbers say history books.

The best thing us think mostly life usual pending face masks adherence social distancing closing indoor activities. (Restaurants theaters gyms)

Help work industries weather least still jobs such. lockdown every months surges again... keep roller coaster covid 19.

I'm guessing get new leadership D.C. we'll probably roller coaster method. considering virus effectively set spread rapidly easily possible unlikely spread far fast.  case fatality rate? Yes, Denmark go masks - Went hard lockdown early, still cases, think great - like 20.000 tests / day, like 20 active cases per day, get response 1-2 days testing.. read Reddit stuff, americans issues beeing tested, issues wearing masks, tests beeing difficult get, long time get reply - much higher infection rate.

All issues makes impossible make comparison Denmark USA - least right now...

Also comparing Denmark USA wrong, Denmark part EU, compare EU USA - biggest difference almost european countries closed borders, solved Corona internally, reopening borders - think big difference.. get run church power reason. mom's school district students cycle week online in-class enough bus drivers.

Why Trump step help New York New Jersey, let fail badly?

And can't say great except poorly. Italy great except couple cities, China great except Wuhan, Spain great except cities poorly.......etc, etc.

The US big, takes long time virus cover whole country getting there. Trump ample opportunity prevent current situation nothing make everything worse.  lose hope, plenty crazy folks news seem determined help California catch up. Even pandemic, literally parentless toddlers without clothes 11 year olds trying take care them. free dom! right put life risk!

/s think going see lot this. lot colleges mental healthcare jumped ship outbreak got real bad state. can't really blame hold I'll them, job assume risks like deadly viral contagion. Oh fuck shit This.. guys know body manufactures antibodies demand familiar invader enters body right?

That’s exactly true. Long lived plasma cells cell type makes antibodies time there’s virus around. cells responsible keeping levels antibodies blood. antibody titers drop off, it’s sign cells died off. 

You still memory B cells, don’t make antibodies. They’re capable dividing lot turning kind cell make antibodies, takes little bit time (the process similar memory B cells too). 

That’s articles focused circulating levels antibodies. that’s what’s going stop people infected entirely. Memory cells help clear faster, aren’t sitting ready rage instant you’re reinfected. Forgive ignorance, T-Cell/CD theory? suspect COVID March April (I've started feel like again), antibody tests took May June came back negative. schools aren’t person classes? Trump's one charge making pandemic political issue. needs go! I’m horror movies, I’ve played Division Last Us games know exactly now. would require trust study pure unbiased without automatic wealth bias inclusion. 

Fact is, current known us cases deaths 4.5% mortality basic math. Im good asymptomatic confirmation passing family. me?

And fundemental question defines differences. say unimportant, life death. Definitely critical enough get sort lockdown exemption. 

I get religious argument could made ""Salvation vs. Damnation,"" reasonable religious spiritual leaders made reasonable accommodations safely conducting services virtually. Heck -- live Church services available TV decades already. already solutions putting forth jurisdiction keep people going church seems like something could bad implications, no?

No. explicitly Churches -- happen place large groups people gather indoors. Giving Churches exemption comes worse implications. Haha stay mad Dear God. happened everywhere spread like wildfire....China, Italy, Spain, NYC....It's terrible sign...praying you, praying Florida, we're next. horrible. People Florida, stay home! work, wear mask! 

Shit. want go work tomorrow. don't. fairness number Mexicans trying get states really pretty reasonable. real issue South America. Oh misread ""*threatens*"" still made sense Maybe replaced ties masks may useful... Trump changed residence Florida technically Florida man American exceptionalism attitude bring us herd-immunity faster. Actually started 100s AD first Christians would go Jewish services Saturday, services next day. look-up ""First day week"" Bible concordance see pattern already starting last books bible written. Currently, done whole lot better US terms people died COVID-19 (if take numbers face value). Thats national shame. can't imagine US continues decreasing death rate though. that's less 1% death rate. believe possible hospitals get overrun get literally care.

The observed death rate right low supportive care 10% people severe reaction. hospitals overrun riding home, death rate likely tick dramatically. 

So many numbers thrown around context-dependent, context existence enough healthcare save rationing decisions. even NYC ability draw resources states supplement keep fight - California longer tons doctors ventilators spare like March, deal surge FL AZ TX getting help places (and Fire Island stupidity ends bad looked like could be, NY resources share soon, either.  windows tinted energy efficiency.

August 25 - Pennsylvania God’s Fucking retarded Manhattan dense parts boroughs, yes. parts Queens, example, parts state, easy avoid people unless stores. punchline joke, funny, makes us look bad association. exactly problem backwards anti-inclusion bullshit. Jesus Paul got pissed exactly kind persecution right now. According guys' bible, one allowed judge god.

So lets stop acting like going bars sacrilege gatekeeping gets christian based often attend church.

""And pray, hypocrites do: worship streets synagogues everyone see, already received reward.""

Maybe try acting christ-like want taken seriously christian.

P. S. -- someone reading christian(or isnt one) gatekeep try dictate holy enough, post you. ok.

Edit - words Haha... upvoted make 666 upvotes... 🤣🤣😈 It’s going keep going going going till everyone knows someone died COVID. good NEO. I’ve come accept fate. know. I'm going honest, *wanted* believe since sounds feasible. 650 linked churches? That's barely anything, really. Shows pathology USA. casual disregard deaths many people even children. guess known US people nothing sandy hook. Edit: toned down. Big oof. read TX FL bad shape still capacity although it’s getting dicey areas hospitals ICU’s Arizona almost beds entirely?? fooled. also pay $1 mask door bring own. Dude probably making killing cost entry alone. understanding students weren’t allowed campus classes, student athletes wouldn’t allowed campus practice/games. Maybe students attend campus classrooms sometimes way around that.  top deaths, mention lung damage lasting issues. US food infrastructure came close collapse pandemy!! That's said! even bought full pages newspaper!!!!!!! 

They lie me. great. little dbag who’s running job seat now, would fire. celiac recoiled gluten free included true them. man cheat way college would know difference requirments guidelines. Right. semitic Jews, yall seen Palestinians today? might little tanned due working outside time though.  don’t know churches y’all talking Catholic Churches either 1)Closed, 2)Providing online masses, 3)Open strict procedures (requiring masks, social distancing, etc.) Clearly safest option prevent infections. /s 250-300 day shifts best do, bud. Exactly US needs do, arrest imprison millions people. teachers make enough is, let alone adding risk COVID, entitled whiny kids spoiled 3-5 months school discipline inevitable complaints parents.

Retiring seems like would better mental health. cite occasion past thirty years American soldiers “massacred” American civilians American soil?

I’m familiar Kent State. 50 years ago nobody Guard firearm alive then. background exposure book picked started casually flipping one day.

Don't eat stuff found dead.

Stay away pork shellfish.

Don't fuck sister.

And thought ""what atheists angry about? common sense health code."" Yup. seems like says obvious shit weeks months everyone already knows it.  measures would probably consider draconian US

Yeah, that's I'm saying. agree. anybody know many Coronavirus cases present cough symptoms, know numbers coughing symptom, exclusively coughing symptom. animals United States seem good deal trouble it.

Thanks warring evolutionary misstep, Homo-Trumpius, we're shown natural selection department lobsters.

Fucking *lobsters.* What? No, that's wrong. Like, morally reprehensible.

A large fine? Sure. could suggest better alternative businesses cannot let people unless wearing masks? know virus spreads worse inside out, building makes sense. put people jail it? Fuck no. 

And again, breaking quarantine? fine. virus deadly people. Jail prison time ruin person's life future. can't people nothing wrong, per se. purposefully getting people sick, trying harm others.  I'd love to. given can't get schools restaurants shutdown, doubt we're going anything else. isn’t teachers like remotely there’s vaccine table? seems lot simpler put screen classrooms remote teachers rather making everyone stay home. moved buying handles everclear 5 gallon barrels chemical supply house.... hope never get 55 gallon point. wish possible. blood pressure 160s 90s last night, thinking classes resuming. Mid April number almost one death every 10 seconds, worldwide.

The USA 2.7x many cases back then, roughly one death every 45 seconds.

(I hope math accurate) cant tell sarcastic serious leaves stuff cars cleaning? dont want get chemicals stuff, especially something going face. did!!!!!!!! Thank reply, made useful points. think answer sort nuanced, maybe that's immediate answer it. like italian society resumed back normality though... think fact deaths going cases going points deaths lagging cases, younger demographic, better treatment also actual infections per day pre-lockdown higher now. detecting higher percentage pre-lockdown gives appearance all-time peak infection rate. Cases going right now. reporting aberration. good data pre-lockdown infections/day, can't say infections/day actually all-time peak right now. randomized control trials come in, however due lack almost regulation market, making sure everyone takes multivitmain might mean study valid multivitamin. Studies shown many contain much list ingredients Sorry :( Someone correct I’m wrong, governor authority tribal lands. thought took act Congress enact anything affecting reservations. speak experience school 100% online one day person one day online specific time. sport already starting date practices. team meet campus practice. know school basketball team campus already began practicing already positive cases. I’m sure it’s going work full online campuses I’m guessing let athletes campus practice. BLM idiot protesters caused uptick churches. thought hoax Sounds like need get more, measures would probably consider draconian US, China, Spain, Italy &amp; Vietnam, countries successfully contained outbreak. 

You know excessively harsh? 130k death  doesnt - anyone - tell learning disabled orange slug kinds things? mean, cardiac arrest different heart attack. heart attack relatively survivable event that's almost always indicated relatively substantial precursors like family history, calcium buildup, cholesterol, etc. Cardiac arrest entirely random tends leave someone dead pretty immediately. 

Heart attack patients need hospitalized helped. Hell, lot heart attack patients never even know one, find line EKG checkup. Cardiac arrest patients likely died time anyone gets there. get it, small population small population density, like New Zealand. ACTUAL Arizona numbers 7/07/2020 10,956 tests... 3,653 positive... 33.34% positivity rate. 

[Use drop menu see number daily tests... positivity rates individual states. “The number deaths right much higher first wave. victims ages, young well elderly, even children.”

This US soon.... go church needs higher. post ridiculous, religion haters piling cause makes feel better religious people idiots. churches reopened *are* dumb, like idk, rest 90% America reopening dumb. 

I'm religious. saying, literally headline worthy ALL. It’s even worse you’re POC, especially you’re black. I’m white partner I’m incredibly lucky police usually nice us reason everyone shouldn’t enjoy privilege. insurance people can’t afford deductible likely seek medical help die home. sad.  Last heard Florida around 800-900 per capita that's probably considering size Florida can't really ship patients critical care place costs, man power, logistics they'd likely die transit anyways. Well shit fuck ballz. I’m Jew also wash hands meals. Passover though ...I’m Christian. NYC also brought navy ship built field hospital Central Park. did

Sweden suffered horribly Ahh new record every day, exciting. much winning! Murica heck yeah!!!! Basically 100% fine. Even you’re one worst states. Covid 19 times harder spread outdoors without mask. mask keeping distance chances essentially 0 So? every person Tik Tok talk things perspective Chinese people? save community leaving consider 1/50 new daily cases per capita better... might know China transparent big ol' fibby bois death toll Wuhan. reach point, many died homes, government continues lie death toll first major outbreak. visible population lined claim remains loved ones substantially dwarfs government claims. know lots people died home china admits (per consensus international intelligence community). got glimpse Italy - published death rate still 10%.

But again, can't really know that, inadequacy testing (temporary ongoing) masks reality, making accurate calculations impossible. I'm surprised would even bother something laughably baseless ""Trump's estimates"". might well asking 3 year old tell stock market. unable muster mental fortitude put small piece frabic mouth nose, extremely mentally unstable danger others. End story. 

To angry request makes sense. temporarily protects getting sick around sickened you. 

It height selfishness protect fellow man simple direct method. Eh. one hand, want see community spread. hand, event like first-order infections going get hit worse, culling types would go event like preferable. *have* severe illnesses deaths, best least medically sensible get it. florida man, administration monopoly fake virus cures like bleach, disinfectants, hydroxychloroquine

The Government hates [Food Drug Administration, solution sold Grenons becomes bleach ingested typically used things treating textiles, industrial water, pulp paper. FDA says people died hospitalized drinking solution. ..."" totally agree. easy understand molded, heavy, 3M style N95 masks expensive resource-intensive make millions public use short period time.

But FDA could approved cheap, lightweight KN95 style masks China millions sale, government allocated time attention putting production. Or, least, making surgical style masks super cheap abundant, even though they're great keeping air going around sides KN95 masks are. 

Instead, lied. then, gov use Defense Production Act, mostly used ""seize"" mask shipments counties, states hospitals liberal states give cronies free sell full markup. Fauci telling people use cloth masks, instead admitting great nation can't make enough cheap, non-woven fiber masks metal nose strips couple elastic ear loops everyone. people common sense listening conflicting information losing jobs can't pay bills, listening authorities anymore.

If Fauci lied masks back beginning, still lying cloth masks, least public would someone credibility listen to. people ""rip"" (like OP's post title says), public health leadership, government DC right now, Dr. Fauci himself. One Covid time please! *any* statistics (or estimates etc.) available % population vulnerable cytokine storm aspect covid?

For unaware, cytokine storm complication relatively common viral respiratory infections (including covid), responsible number deaths (and near-deaths) covid victims otherwise young healthy.

There hundreds recent articles respected publications topic (just search ""covid cytokine storm""), reading 10+ still absolutely idea large population people susceptible cytokine storm is. That's good question. I'm sure. administrators want return everyone campus, whatever reason, despite fact staff work home, classes taught online. think all-or-nothing approach campus implementing flawed.

There options like bringing students onto campus programs cannot taught online, like labs. making students take core courses electives taught online semester, come back campus next semester fall 2021, things settled down. better approaches bringing 100% campus back fall. think lot psychology culture. We're used getting kind disease here, even though flirt SARS extent. took several weeks people get used idea many things would shut cancelled. 

I think even government magically known full shut needed, able enact without getting revolt hands. Imagine if, March 1st, federal government tried cancel flights, schools, concerts, sports events, closed border, bars, restaurants rest. never would got away it.

It took weeks hammering bad could thick skulls. weeks, spreading exponentially. lost lot time there. There's factors play. starters, NYC actually real fear lot children access food schools closed. Thousands schools steady source food NYC. known beginning.

Parents also issues childcare start return work. 

It's safe option all, there's real fear serious harm already disadvantaged kids families, made lightly quite cities. waiting list, go home? I'm American...


But number deaths people 50 incredibly low. 2k cases backlog Jul 2-5 LA county. TECHNICALLY highest one day total.  Americans Disabilities Act, Title III Sec. 36.208 Direct **(a) part [Title III ADA] require public accommodation permit individual participate benefit goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages accommodations public accommodation individual poses direct threat health safety (b) Direct threat means significant risk health safety others cannot eliminated modification policies, practices, procedures, provision auxiliary aids (c) determining whether individual poses direct threat health safety others, public accommodation must make individualized assessment, based reasonable judgment relies current medical knowledge best available objective evidence, ascertain: nature, duration, severity risk; probability potential injury actually occur; whether reasonable modifications policies, practices, procedures mitigate risk.

Also note that, definition, Costco, Sam's Club, BJ's, members-only stores private clubs therefore ADA apply patrons considered public accommodations. amazing. I’m proud Italy. [Research Determines Protests Cause Spike Coronavirus that's scientific study. county health director surely knows better. explains TP hoarders. it’s much easier believe system benefits poor people you’re “stuck middle” accept poor helped.   say, I'm assuming surge capacity. would expect governor shut really 150 maximum surge ICU beds left state. 

Key numbers: 145 ICU occupancy free, 9%. Net increase 17 ICU beds occupied since 7/2 indicating hospitals approaching capacity. half ICU occupancy patients COVID, can't tell COVID primary cause.

Very grim news, hopefully people act surge capacity reached, idea much surge capacity is. Unfortunately rest country can't contribute resources AZ since we've got one fire like Northeast back March. comment submission history change nurse saying Swedish health care failing people?

No, creeping profiles stupid box rox. I've seen, really consistent conservative response part. mostly agree pandemic handled naturally many willing give liberal government credit. responses seem fall one two camps:

1 - Trudeau take action quickly enough closed border earlier

or

2 - virus really big problem, shut like did

those pretty much diametrically opposed viewpoints, guess kind representative modern conservative party - nobody really sure stands point.

but funny thing is, IMO response provincial/territorial level much important federal level. federal government responsible border closures financial aid outside that, things handled provincial level (health care, business closures, mask mandates, reopening plans, etc.)

that's partially see big discrepancy provinces. Quebec Ontario still woods (although things looking better) BC Atlantic provinces leaders flattening curve. Prairie provinces done well (outside Alberta ok great), honestly I'd attribute lot low population density substitute teachers already - emergency substitute certification require teaching certificate. Even cannot get enough substitutes cities. Wasn’t also tradition killing humanely possible disagree ok. actually support protests allowed, media’s push one side murders side angels, even though called angels murdered people......legitimately murdered them. know?  point Chinese economic growth almost entirely benefit wealthy counts growth grandparents subsistence farmers. literally outgrown virtually every former Soviet republic (who subsistence farmers time Chinese.) people Iraq two decades war last 50 years yet average Iraqi similar spending power average Chinese citizen. 

Stop buying Chinese propaganda. They’re country dirt poor slaves rich slave drivers. 

And frankly isn’t better you’re right. You’re saying continue allow widespread abuse tyranny exchange economic growth. Effectively point Chinese citizenry allowing modern day holocaust money. Okay, thank you! Good points. However, one question: think reasonable allow people attend church services cars masks on? Now, stated, really necessary people worship, feel like makes easier seem hypocritical first glance average conservative way people social distance attend church time. Assuming death rate 1.5% initially, peak 2.700 death corresponds almost 200.000 infections per day.

But dont know death rate really back then. 

If mortality 5% corresponds 50.000 infections per day. mortality 0.5% corresponds staggering 500.000 infected per day.

I think 60k conservative, honestly. fear even vaccine, may get boosters every couple months.

Why would first time humanity would something like that? That's big claim, I'm gonna need sauce that. Thia guy piece shit. I'm pretty sure would act way state Florida Maine wow..that's almost 550 work retail management store also signs requiring masks, myself/my employees tell customers wear mask. However, 95-98% customers comply mandate.

While may make sense allowed tell customer need mask, would much rather deal asshole yelling worse 16-18 year old staff. don’t get paid enough that. Here's one you. open 32 days teachers heard plan!!!! hybrid dthe teachers done NOTHING PREPARE IT!!!! OMFG. AAPL stock 1.94% likely right. think important thing allowing students live dorms rather campus classes. see schools saying online classes live dorm athletes living dorm practice. Online classes necessarily mean one campus unfortunately. Thank you. transplant Florida (god help me) surrounded non-science, vaccine, trumpets. becoming desperate leave country. lot easier said done. certainly do-able since pariahs lack leadership. Thank empathy. might hotter moment, average June temperatures FLA hotter Ohio. Duh, everyone experienced fear depression due COVID. also provided online instruction. awful everybody, mean teachers need risk health one hazardous environments America parents rid kids? Im sorry, teaching completely doable virtually. job teach, thats finished college didnt become babysitter. Democrats blocked wall extra border security.
Democrats inflamed BLM.
Democrats fucked NY NJ bad.
Democrats attempted block Trump's travel ban called racist. 

It seems like already knew issue America :) one party interest everything hurt America election. Florida governor's mansion? appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* Where's staff going come from? Especially we're losing healthcare workers... Can't hire anyone manage ventilator administer drugs that. government allowed make rules good public health. ban shitting streets, mandate facemasks worst pandemic century. see directive come WHO. Still, Virginia believes wearing ties contributed spread virus, say they're wrong?

Possibly shoelaces next. would though? 

As office owner/CEO, i'm already paying premium space dense city. cut costs hiring people remotely partial remote, either pay smaller space pay lower wages, both. 

For middle class office work, 60k year damn good living Oklahoma, fairly low average place like Seattle/New York/Chicago.

It take lot effort look role, find candidates, price competitively depending candidate lives. lot positions post salary gets negotiated hiring process. Read usernames, troll. Sorry tag along I'm also interested! resources would recommend dna/rna?

Edit: ah sorry! see link topic. looks great, I'll start :) Kind expert (took immunology classes degree), depends presence symptoms. symptomatic, means adaptive immunity kicked in, you’ll likely acquire immunity. symptoms, there’s chance adaptive immunity active, it’s likely particles handled innate immunity. branch immunity always active, little memory. good rule thumb vaccination, symptoms = immunity wore masks Sounds right lol. hope protests help fix broken system. employer seen productivity effectiveness increase work home said plans force us back office. 

Of course work healthcare we're busy making everything telemedicine compatible live design philosophy. guy bring back public stoning. Well, upholding law *should* job. cashier refused ring somebody like they're buying... would fired pretty quickly. 

Enforcing law pretty high priority for.. know... Law enforcement... don’t know going behind scenes, saying people power. people NEED agree lockdown, need understand it’s necessary. Lockdowns issued it’s effective people still seeing friends, going parties, protesting lockdown.  y'all kidding think state local gov'ts hire new teachers take place.

We'll looking average elementary class sizes 30s secondary class sizes 40s 50s. certainly exposes charlatans are. I'm genuinely curious, attack I'm anything covid denier.



Why reopen schools September make masks mandatory make kids teachers socially distance? Online school disaster work California also massive population. Florida Arizona far concerning. Use lose July 30th think felt okay making policy first place long you’re protesting correct thing aren’t public health risk? 

The public health risk isn’t side effect protest. It’s main goal. They’re ACTIVELY TRYING make pandemic worse. sure. listen CBC interview well? worthwhile. No, there's ""cover up"" Texas. mysterious something causing poor people die home. Wonder could be? /s Atlanta Falcons syndrome. celebrate half time forget there's whole lot time left clock.  phrase used Selfridge's Marshall Field 1910s, back retailers used able give shit back customer. Still always dumb saying. churches denial facts surrounding coronavirus pandemic. back May, month vice president's visit Baptist church Texas choir made hundred people performed. nothing sad pee jokes!  Bless heart Way proactive, boys. motherfuckers protesting couldn’t get hair cut.

Right babied lives. don’t even seem really disagree /u/TalaPark perspective. waste ventilator scum? ventilator would infringing God given freedoms!

Thoughts prayers enough them. pain looking different sites trying find ones present data well current data. find looking old bad data lot. I've wondering paid swedish government something downvoting thing going considering consistent is.

But learned Sweden thing called ""Sverigebilden"" (image Sweden) protect cost,.

""Sverigebilden"" also there's hardly critical questions media Sweden well.

They're living lies. Directly indirectly... virus taking large painful toll. wish country would come together fight one group people. suppose Jesus method profitable give source tecashine found one &lt;3

[real excess deaths actually HIGHER official coronavirus death  mother dealing right now, pressure head, caught covid recovered first beginning May, it’s come back two months later, fatigue head pressure. I’m worried dementia I’m going break fact extremely plausible is...depressing. hesitant lock initially

he first governor lockdown soon say 'well, rates go up, people die right away takes time' respond 'well, dont know that, know media making worse....' seriously, huh? offence, death hospital rates trending down? Last check, month since cases started rising, yet significant increases.

Like, give fuck hit 7 billion people damaging church began service parking deck, one family could sit per parking space line. also require us wear masks throughout service. There’s almost way muck get sick.

I think people worry lot less churches spreading virus, whole lot virus spread protests riots maskless people. It’s even close magnitude. I’ve asked many churchgoing friends also wear masks church. Thank correction! Edited  Nope. local WalMart delivery curbside pickup services. one town 20 minutes away believe offers it, ours. don’t know exact answer someone living Texas watching unfold it’s clear reports majorly underreported. Testing sites slowing closing, hospitals moving around beds low ICU counts. governor (Abbott) jack squat blaming everybody himself. Unexplained pneumonia deaths like 300% right counted towards Covid deaths. everything actively suppressed (but still breaking records) Ironic given sub marked conspiracy sub reddit. Glad hear it, diagnosed genetic issue gives danger low levels vitamin monitored. Honestly feels like every thing calling indicator specifically targeted me. nobody knows truth here, anyody believe anything comes government point?  Whenever show ""crowded Covid hospital"" pictures Italy always use one.

I guess werent many hospitals Italy conditions. always talking one. show numbers please? guy argues US best health care system world right? Lmao 1% oh nooooo.
That's since start pandemic. People saying means 1 100 sick. that's wrong. less significantly fucking less saying otherwise pushing fear agenda. Telling someone go die isnt really appropriate response... wishing death upon others reprehensible normalized online interactions imo Consumerism religious experience many, sadly. news? knew back early March! Churches, bars gyms rona hotspots Texas options? Plenty testing options Houston. sure you’re assuming churchgoers less likely wear masks. community church opened responsibly possible mandates masks. There’s major distancing, touching, books, holy water lingering afterwards. reason getting stricter lockdowns?

&amp;#x200B;

Is stonks? stonks it? That's literally all? rich want preserve market shares? lol known thing, already? remember back Feb/March hearing could this. 


EDIT: Ah, six million dollar virus. Stronger, Faster, Better. Ugh. matter short term. 0 cases GDP rebound back precovid really fast never argument. makes feel better, win lol. go feel superior. I've already made point addressed point. Yeah, he’s fucking idiot. Personally, find old Orgy Saga appealing current one based manifest contempt knowledge, ignorant hate rhetorical strategy centered solely Worst Cuntnugget Ever. 

Oh well. least always bunga bunga memories. cocaine. Mostly cocaine. problem first sign outbreak dying down, people going throw behavioral changes keeping R0 close one. mean, 2000 years ago washing hands would WAY ahead curve. like legal ""teapot"" argument. one argument better combined.

""First, never borrowed teapot you. Secondly, returned teapot perfect condition. Thirdly, teapot already giant dent side borrowed it"" eager reopen they're money hungry, tax exempt corporations. Wipe out. them. Right now? Nowhere. borders closed closed Americans. Deleted. Sorry lost head. Sweden's death per capita rate lower many countries strict lockdowns.

As Japans.

Stop denying science. Well didnt prove anything said wrong.

From cdc:

People increased risk severe illness

[Older Underlying Medical ...and STILL going open schools 2nd wave numbers different US's second (first?) wave numbers hundreds thousands BLM protestors. aren’t fault.

Meanwhile. churches near online service Dude something troll others here? Take bullshit r/conspiracy still entire empty hospital phoenix reopened since needed april. surprising all. older, immunocompromised life, playing Russian roulette, what? China literally got situation control draconian lockdowns unseen anywhere else world. Lockdowns main tool China implemented throughout duration COVID-19 Haha faith I, take care best you. live Houston. 3 available testing sites within 3 mile radius me. Two require appt doctors order. It’s said current COVID medical practices therapies successful increasing survivability, may contribute lower death rate. point would sooner believe Florida mandate ass masks case people fart virus mandate face masks. church

It's worth pointing Church leaders countries Coronavirus quite politicised telling congregation stay away hight outbreaks avoid spreading Coronavirus.

Leaders three Abrahamic religions told followers God everywhere pray alone follow examples set holy books avoid spreading plague.

Regardless opinion BLM protests, Churchgoing simply unnecessary unwise.  whatever helps ya sleep bud Websites super pretty, hey, I’m glad young folk this. I’m convinced older people get us mess. it.

Pretty sure deserve tiny bit entitled comes employment since PhD.

 want use PhD design carry research studies cradle grave you, gonna make worth time, including 5 grueling years took get degree. Wait, what? There's simple solution that. family refuses keep safe simple act like wearing mask... invite them. 

As matter fact. hold large gatherings first place. way, safe Thanksgiving families. remember Doug Ducey said everything open slowly multiple weeks cases reach certain number. Trump said he’s coming Arizona days arrival everything opened up. fact things bad places still open makes sense. 100% Ducey Trumps fault. we're talking two life death scenarios need addressed immediately, mutually exclusive:

- Coronavirus killing people. 

- System racism white supremacy killing Black people. 

*(in fact, they're intertwined pretty closely -- there's lot said imbalance access healthcare)*

Black lives can't wait coronavirus go away. wait ""ideal"" time protest, system racism continues churn away background Black lives continue matter. 

Church need happen right now. Going Church life death. activity sacrificed right efforts supress spread covid.

Protesting cannot sacrificied right now, sacrificing protesting done expense Black minorities' lives. despite ""risky"" activity terms covid, much essential activity respects saving BIPOC lives.

**Edit**: others pointed out, Church also indoor activity, ups risk covid transmission. worth noting, think ""indoor vs. outdoor"" major takeaway comparing activities. video Fauci didn’t even say that. said falling CFR indication getting infected average 15 years younger months ago. I'd say hes handling pretty well especially compared neighbors. Hes following CDC guidelines daily briefings well halting moving phase 3 reopening. could honestly better probably best response south COVID already mutated contagious, 

This certainly proven. celebrity doctors Italy claiming something publicity necessarily less deadly. virus fine spreading since range illness wide. unlikely evolutionary pressure virus less deadly point. mean weaken, see evidence needs right now.

It's much pressure, competition. right virus already ""pretty good"" spreading due long incubation time often mild symptoms occur. imagine mutating way people mild cough 3 weeks instead feeling like death staying home, would even better spreading new strain might outcompete current one. 

Regardless though, saving grace virus might *isn't* mutation prone. mutates enough roughly track spread, enough suddenly require different antibodies fight (i.e.: flu) get lethal. Honey figures don’t mean anything don’t state per capita death rate, Sweden relatively low population 6,000 much bigger number would Germany US That's looking end May, Southern states started spiking.. updated numbers gauge whether undercount not.

Here state breakout number claims. take look I'm dumber so. Good luck banning screaming roller coaster. It’s like banning singing church take music away. based you’re saying:

Why death rate increasing multiple states?

Because logic, death rates states going down, isn’t it?

And no, states aren’t NY levels. Yet, say yet know exponential growth works. someone long history vitamin deficiency despite taking supplements appreciate review study. see would hard draw conclusions limitations study. Knowing admitted patients history Vitamin deficiency would helpful. Florida really horrible. friend said passed 11000 cases day counting nonpermanent residents, nursing homes, prisons. Hi, maybe take look churches adapted COVID times. Mine emptied holy water basin, set well 6” distancing families, removed books, mandated masks, nobody holds hands Father, tithes put box end opposed passing baskets. Also, pews emptied one one end we’re told linger leave. experience, churches area excellent communication gone beyond open responsibly possible. Thats short ""I dont want listen logical reasoning fit narrative."" whole thing nightmare, right? Cheers. Celebrate. Well done! thank you. say that? People can't take statement without jumping extrapolations. Also possible they're worse ascertaining covid cases, meaning higher proportion cases severe ones. still try apply. today. Google, show number uninsured Americans? simple mask primarily intended protect others, helps protect you. common sense published studies show masks work reduce airborne particles; 100% significantly. Combine appropriate physical distancing, adequate ventilation safety precautions, reduce impact virus without lock home indefinitely. 

If sure Fauci wrong, what's recommendation deal pandemic? Even is, feel confident Americans taking it? Florida D.C. USA Florida  Yes, although gamble US govt ones funding it.  many people have:
1. leadership
2. patience No, position typically pays 10K less cheaper areas, would make hard live now. price competitively attract quality employees, look nationally roles, might paid significantly less. hell mean skills? basic stuff. expect kids 4 11 years old sit infront laptop day nicely following orders? going happen.

Kids high schools mute teacher play dumb sounds playing games. That's exactly happened school.

Remote learning sustainable. fantasy.

The goverment country realized opened schools again. schools open fully fall. Service workers esp tourism, entertainment, hospitality, restaurants really hit hard likely recover anytime soon. major conferences shut lack international domestic tourism. matter. obvious entire time. super-spreader incidents like churches, choirs, family dinners, etc, healthy people (who obese lifestyle/immune/metabolic disorders) got severe COVID-19 well individual-exposure cases like cabs, cars, etc. healthy people developed severe COVID-19, involved indoor/closed spaces lot air exchange. separate kind circumstances healthy people known regularly developed severe COVID19 circumstances develop asymptomatic mild cases, former implicate airborne transmission. 

The US medical community atrocious public health problems always been. day one, ignored natural health approaches coronavirus -- include masks social distancing -- order wholly focus scoring big pharmaceutical magic bullet like treatment vaccines. negligent incompetent everything else, including ability come coherent message masks makes sense public. 

Also, U.S. focused attacking China actually pay attention made containment efforts successful. We're epitome condescending ignoramuses, comes learning effective coronavirus mitigation approaches Asians successful coronavirus.

It's obvious works doesn't, actually listen we've telling people someone fool believe. I've telling family ignore advice cloth masks since forever, buy provide right kinds masks family.

Edit: Another stupid thing government FDA contacting people giving equivalent federal cease desist orders stop telling people take Vitamin Vitamin C help COVID-19. random clinical trials help improve immune response coronavirus conducted. functionally backward public health leadership developed world, entire world. people would better ignored US public health leaders altogether looked things factual sources. sympathy people listening public health leaders anymore, people pretend ""smart side"" debates without checking anything incompetent authority figures say. JPow need him?  Can't true, God loves you. /s LOL, “noble losers rarely get statues”?!! 😆🤣😂Guess you’ve never anywhere south Mason-Dixon line, then. get different job requires office? long they're ""storming streets"" ingurgitating IHOP they're conduct unassailable, correct?

Less 200 60.

Stop denying science. cousin airline pilot manual labour right make extra cash. laid since March. protests open air vast majority people wearing masks, like cities welcomed people protest. Cops beat shit protestors every city. Also indoor church bunch people believe wearing masks makes easier spread. Looks like someone posted earlier nurse had, spoiler alert, even 3 masks nothing oxygen  interesting mention Norway given they've appologised lockdown said necessary. death rate one highest world, go They’re suing right charge $100 family four, watch movie eat $50 popcorn, soda candy, enclosed theater, dozens breathing, sneezing, coughing, COVID-farting human bags flesh water?

Only 53% Ventilators use right now, still plenty.  We're much better shape Italy NYC peaks.  

 

I still feel like things control; number people AZ see complaining actively refusing wear masks high.  know going take convince people mask wearing going least disruptive least costly measure trying control spread. change roughly 10 percent, still accurate within tenth single percent. One answer .5 percent, above. intents purposes, given uncertainty inputs, within tenth percent mortality rate told expect isn’t really going change people’s risk assessments. Unfortunately that’s works airlines it’s layoffs seniority. That’s offering early retirement packages older guys hoping would take them. lawyer packages include 50% pay three years health benefits. Keep mind senior guys airlines make well $300,000. Pretty sure could live comfortably even 50% that. almost like mass protesting global pandemic leads mass infections virus. turning sharply last weeks? would love retire, yet. They're giving medical exemptions people diabetes liver, kidney, heart lung issues, hypertension. us well forty, yet sixties. We're looking jobs dreading August. highlights ability humans accomplish lofty goals work together collective ideology. Either ethic/religious group, country, preferably species. Florida back leaderboard nearly 10k cases. killed 130k people US alone. sure, “isn’t really big deal”. Fuck you. lol even handful. 

Life went *as normal* 

it didnt evwn lockdown like europe. Mom told brother come well I'd much rather room 20 kids 5 days week supermarket thousands random people walking day. Yeah. Many us know inconveniences unconstitutional. They're inconvenient. report cases active ones? paying tax exempt entities taxpayer bailout money can... still services one main spreaders COVID??

Sometimes hate fucking country. agree what's point bragging now? Seems kinda egotistical times need supportive other. 

Don't get wrong, native American someone live here, sucks bad. Trump sucks bad. half people state refuse believe existence virus personally affected. 

But bragging help anyone. reminds country taken fools. Lets know others would rather make fun failures offer assistance. could help lol. Americans dense. middle-right, maybe middle-left ;p know even news, needed saying.

The bar low ground; buried getting deeper day. Good thing lymphocyte immunity lasts much longer antibodies do.

You guys know body manufactures antibodies demand familiar invader enters body right? Thanks explaining. sounds scary. keep car, got work day realized took cleaning car forgot put back. felt awkward getting office without mask. What's use catching asymptomatic patients can't contact tracing afterwards system overloaded?

Even vast testing capacity US, impossible catch all, even majority, asymptomatic cases. public dollars time act indeed 5 months ago things keep getting worse nothing done now. still better act 5 months late much later never. People tip anyway. Tips supposed voluntary donation, US somehow turned part workers salary pay minimum.

Once again, blame government. I'll never understand US lets get fucked people power often. Plot Twist: Sunshine makes virus stronger. Like Superman. case, winning losing. area, fully open. Buffets, churches, beaches, name it. people go that, without wearing mask (it's maybe 50/50 point), I'm gonna someone protesting distance someone else mask on. Yeah Ontario took little bit, Doug Ford stepped back let experts manage crisis. happy every time says ""I listen experts"" ""the experts telling X"". never locked US, really. on, month 5 this? properly locked 3-4 weeks could end this.

Your argument works pretend none countries exist. finds yet another aspect COVID19 near last adopt... impressive it’s still taking time get results back. time something think about. Mandate what? Mold spore magnets pieces cloth literally see through? wish mask culture would end, 
absolutely nothing. nice gut flora frends OK, except medical professionals making [such claims since people using Alaska loophole lower 48 though? seems like massive pain ass go get Canada

Edit: Nevermind, double checked Alaska loophole idk reason thought applied people coming going Alaska. imagining people flying Anchorage lower 48 could rent car sneak backdoor. realize could waltz south say driving Alaska. apply every border crossing? Western ones? leaving didn’t cost money. I've Menards multiple times past months. require employees patrons wear masks. seems pretty chill every time go there. Everyone wears masks. forgot bring mask, buy one 89-cents.

That's true. post COVID inflammatory syndrome possibility. also infect parents, teachers, grandparents people stores way adults can. Going take years travel recover. Oh right America fired her. Idiot. could happen anywhere. Thank god stricter restrictions every one neighbor states, right?

There’s still many sick dying. 

We’re holding line barely, that’s win. lay old guys keep young ones working. makes sense even larger disaster

I see would make things worse. Much power control pandemics rests State level anyways.

* People Democratic states followed science followed state governors, ignored federal government, situation largely control.

* People Republican states died.

At point Republican governors recognizing cannot ignore second wave. perfect time Fauci leave. second wave thoroughly discredited Trump Republicans nothing will. wife Jehovah's Witness give group credit pandemic. in-person meetings door-to-door witnessing shut quite early on. even thinking meeting person anytime soon. Zoom way! worry lot too. missed much life shy younger. think anti-social circle jerk reddit makes things worse. would require people read care history types people care history think means racist. sucks assmar! (Bonus points get original reference :)) Frankly, surprised, suspect Texas Florida interpreting numbers positive way really are.

While NY's Cuomo definitely perfect, admired candid approach situation, sorry can't say Florida Texas leadership. means much higher ceiling. Considering data suggest lockdowns right decision completely wrong.

Please acknowledge science unlike sub.

Wide scale Lockdowns never necessary.

So, month ago, sacrificed 1.22 million years American lives virus. now. even tomorrow. suppose would fine! seems like hassle worth, guess one leaving cars, cool. 

It seem like gateway towards, ""hey, we're already here, let's step cars go hang say hi [insert whomever],"" put many guardrails people, suppose. That's it?  nah polling says otherwise Good looking out. lemming parrot party? Lol even that? 

A question asked people living state perpetual fear administration. 

Maybe, depends congress. Better nothing good incentive get tested. backs reasoning, thank you! 

...but also feeling last hotspot states becoming strained. We’re already seeing eerily similar articles Texas saw NY back March/April, like people dying increased heart attacks Texas now. deaths related covid probably added death count, byproduct hospital strain. well, stopped somehow, vaccine. less deadly

on original question; thought strain kills less (or slower) opportunity spread host thus compete deadly strain Plus California. whole thing reminds Dwight vs computer.

Healthcare workers = Dwight

Covid 19 = Computer pants. slippery slope It’s $$$$. Gotta pay pastors! COVID damned! people don’t understand US politics well enough, and/or young remember time US wasn’t partisan politically. Congress much efficient parties closer identifying other. 

Also fuck people downvoting centrist. much sheep blindly side party times? Let people think Oh get it. they're told to. Got it. weird deaths primarily gastero-intestinal virus now. Generally long stay hydrated pass. Even Cholera cured enough Gatorade. I'm going relive months highly public bad messaging masks you. article necessarily support original statement. says Texas' excess deaths Covid testing widely available. mentions nothing medical examiners feeling pressured reclassify. I’m also Kansas. hoping things would less scary order place, went Walmart get prescription almost nobody wearing mask. It’s disgusting. really surrounded idiots fucking state.

""Swedish people"" unhappy.

You read biased articles interview specific Swedes agree whatever argument article trying make.  Dumb Dick Desantis ! Ah, sort thing sometimes. Back Ivan closing (2004), people hurricane parties. remember husband wife two young girls stayed behind. 

They assumed everything blown proportion stayed. Unfortunately, none survived. 

After recovery teams use X marks confirm whether homes/debris dead property, people seemed get better leaving Cat 3+ heads way. long ago enough fear newcomers take new storm seriously. 🙁 People “dying home virus hospitals overloaded.” First, article say people dying virus. Second, hospitals overloaded (if [Texas Medical good indicator, would say is). Frankly, quote article agrees, spreading lie hospitals overloaded *causes people avoid going hospital get much needed medical attention, resulting dying home*. please check arrogance think speak. man weed. Bullshit. Poland laugh modesty Might get turned away too. Loving thy neighbour that. exactly love selfishly refuse wear mask. I'm sorry, still see distinction. 

You're saying throwing people jail might ruin life, risk exposing population large contagious disease allowing people refuse quarantine wear mask, one could kill give crippling, increasingly looks like perhaps life-long, complications, somehow less bad? 

Does person dies this, spends two weeks ICU, brain damage, needs double-ling transplant, etc, life ruined?

Jesus people. Deplorables all. hell theme parks open? disagree china-style lockdown would infinitely better whatever we're US containing virus. even question opinion. 

I wholeheartedly disagree china-style lockdown considered draconian US. make $11.75 hour that’s considered GOOD live. get $11.75 hour people verbally assaulted don’t want catch deadly virus. makes defeated. Would say actual level social interaction returned pre-pandemic levels? would say plenty people still spooked staying home regardless official position? restaurants booming mask-free? many deaths? prefer system I’ve discovered called “masturbation.” 

I’ve conducting lot research quarantine. I’m close breakthrough, gotta go back lab testing. Thanks, notice. less hard hit state I’d want us pay ICU nurses stay state, home, they’re needed here. lol makes laugh honestly AZ never seen punishment it, going punish someone punishment laid them? Also isnt funny party wants defund police wants police enforce mask wearing 😂 (I joking) Lol. surprised much Chinese fingers in.

And besides, case Rueters literally publishing Chinese propaganda directly them. even case generating relaying it. hey name calling rude yep, houston 50% deaths home right normal. NYC approached 200% normal.

what happened nyc going play big cities bother protect citizens Hopefully strong enough take it. mean I'm sure someone hopes that. ""Remember guidance, requirements, purpose facilitate reopening keeping open schools country,"" CDC Director Robert Redfield said.

Stay fuck home! one wants guys confining everyone Beijing homes new outbreak emerged, authorities locked apartment blocks housing compounds close epicenter. high-risk areas, one member per household allowed leave purchase necessities.

Why seen Draconian? cruise ships infected people exact thing worked. really dire infringement personal liberties inconvenience apartment blocks couple weeks save hundreds thousands lives. Well sure *he* thinks getting better. Think lucky people get meet Jesus now! Flattening curve... reaching testing capacity. Oh thought thats u r supposed anyways.... likely learning though observation. Likely people like taste dirt soiled hands licking fingers eating would wash hands beforehand. Likely got sick less. observed. superstitious people, attributed act something holy since performed spared often. .... something like that. never allow leave don’t get infected. Another is, time interacting dead way, ritually wash after. Jewish cemeteries wash basins faucets place reason. troll?

Albeit one funny quite time. Lying still sin. Thou Shalt Kill.

But let's tell church, willfully ignores 2 10 commandments, yet claim Christian. know. like expert state we’ve pretty bad teacher shortages since pay freezes/budget cuts/standardized testing nightmare recession. 

The state’s “solution” make super easy get certified, waive “maximum class size” rules, even resort importing foreign teachers India China. wife finally quit, special ed caseload 50 kids, taught 8 separate periods without planning, sit meetings 20 minute lunch least twice week. Bless hearts r/byebyejob Spot on. I'm Athens last night commissioners unanimously approved mask mandate effective today. least Kemp's recently stated fight local governments enacting mask mandates. know hell freeze pushes anything state though. second coming Rome come going similar fashion.

why running tecashine Virginia, project management. work computer phone. reasoning something going live going away soon. would nearly impossible train someone company works specific account works. raises question people laid furloughed? Easier firing people guess?

Edit- partially understand business perspective however still seems rushed working home shown successful. Also company taking big steps corona proof office, installing touchless devices, setting maximum capacity signs certain areas, temperature checks AM, requiring masks, etc. that's issue move office! ton people end moving big city costs quite high anymore residential real estate quite high. think effect overall costs get lower able pay little less anyway. Even office people become remote variations costs locations locations still desirable others.

The OP happens people left ""believe want believe"".
You're left people hold irrational Borderline dangerous views, actively endanger people around them.

If coronavirus taught anything that, idk say travelling teammate pushes gurney? act stupid blame calling us either. honestly joined group back beginning February watch unfolded horribly since sobering. got politicized plot twist expecting. idea leadership would day deny real threat facing every moment day. say wonder nurse friends ever leave house stay side house away family keep safe. wonder really feel treat patient's who, asked, say refuse wear masks going out. mean human reaction gut that. True thing happens want work due corona get fired everywhere government competent incompetent change this.  Depends state. Michigan at-will state. fire without giving reason justification, it’s federally legal SAY fired home sick kid, fire reason all, staying home sick kid. world inter-connected though. eventually spread everywhere there’s immunity vaccine Short wait times rides, long wait times ICU..sounds like America number land whales, USA definitely number one. guess y’all aren’t donating enough money mega church. Corporate climate denial donations go far. devil Homosexuals must defeated takes lot cash new car. Clotting seen patients vents. point, COVID patients vents. Yeah idk getting downvoted. point, simply wearing mask control outbreak like putting bandaid stump leg shark attack probably still shot would likely take entire country NY &amp; places longer time, existing infections play &amp; we'd see difference month two line like NY. may classroom 13-20 years.

You one *in charge* went classroom.

You one *responsible* went classroom.

You say things like:

* wear mask hat;

* cannot trade mask friend think cooler design;

* *have* wear mask, matter parents say;

* allowed spit another student he's... medieval times bathing excessively (more month) sure fire way catch something.

Washing hands thing bathing. People wash daily basis small basin water clean rag -- might consider today ""sponge bath"". people resources heat gigantic tub water take full-immersion bath home daily, public bath houses.

[This good insight going It’s true medieval sources warn “excessive” bathing. here’s thing, wasn’t really clean, hanging naked bathhouses opposite sex. didn’t want clean, wanted going bath house getting fuck on. shows many people even bother reading article. sentence quote basically 6th 7th sentence. Online giving thing. wholeheartedly disagree china-style lockdown considered draconian US.

Americans consider costco running half sheet cakes draconian, nothing enabling whiniest babies planet bridge far. whose* sister passed* away

Discussed retirement spouse rather put petri dish. Won’t great, going back absolutely irresponsible eyes criminal. Duh Answer:  cases increase, deaths always increase. 

However, rate death growth much slower before, due younger people getting infected. 

I can’t make simpler that. wish could go back Korea. like 5 seconds checkout lane? wearing masks really bad That's IHME it. agree unless start mitigating beyond closing bars, easily surpass this. There's prosperous political career awaiting Republican party. Bwahaha! spent 10 years retail management, tell unequivocally people fired staying home sick kid every single day. might dressed up, everyone knows real reason. Workers’ rights going even less prior this. Everyone desperate job companies whatever want them. It’s get really bad. Don’t ffs. Offering money people walk hospital mask peak idiocy Thanks posting article. part Germany especially interesting. Wtf cutting funding accomplish? Rrrrgggh Oh, see, sorry that. #5yearsoldandsmarterthanTrump county 102% icu capacity now. People still say it’s hoax. flat proud failing. point out... Exactly. fucking unless known infected. I've saying entire time. dumb? I've hoping link. disappointing well-being responsibility Walmart hit miss fill comment card app store see people without masks. 

The Menards next door however downright militant since mandated state. getting past turnstile mask on. They'll sell one $1 (cash only) they're sold come back procured proper face covering. employees pretty good addressing people wearing chin strap, saying much nose coverings. Also, point obsessed people public baths middle ages, Einhard, Charlemagne's biographer, recorded Charlemagne sometimes held entire court meetings hundred people large public bath. Well yes, completely change we're talking about, yes, legal precedence, people done things like lick handles whatnot intent spread covid charged domestic terrorism.

That change fact statement ""if found given covid die, wear mask, convicted premeditated murder"" dangerous, preposterous statement would set legal precedence would damage society greatly. Lots countries opened schools minimal flare-ups.

America run schools safely, take leadership, largely absent today. everyone forced in-person classes, see mass defunding public schools next year. Enrollment drop unless find way make dual enrollment somehow. Trumpster Fire Chief remove need certification executive order.

I'm sure he'd able since teacher certification state law.

But could totally see Abbott/DeSantis/Ducey that. dumb statement, we're teaching guess what... students covid tests. friends want back China right can't blame Fluorescent light UV. we're going lose older generation. RIP grandma. It’s hard scare people tithing via livestream, gotta feel hellfire brimstone close up. California man spikes football everyone campus tests negative start semester would think would cut lot transmission? need looking ways keep control, shit anything potential success 100% Trump Floridian cycle restarts. idea watch online? time? read fine print? high risk, essential worker show symptoms free. Thats fine flu need mass testing NOW. Everyone needs getting tested weekly various levels government react precision. working inaccurate data probably California fucked reopening. curious friend, finally believe maybe possibly masks help? want poke holes research masks? Well, guess likelihood mutations increases infected population, overall virus count. go bars. fucking rocket science. ""to supply enough anti-viral drug remdesivir to treat 5,000 Covid-19 patients preparation potential second wave infections""

It's first paragraph. Dude, one claims one knew actually obvious China, Taiwan, South Korea Asian countries approaching successfully. Information successful approaches available literally everywhere online.

What US show medical attention coronavirus? Loads crappy studies poorly done, rigged make hydroxychloroquine fail, pushing super-expensive remdesivir, actually better much different performance hydroxychloroquine. show billions spent medical studies time spent, $3K/dose remdesivir potentially organ-damaging side effects maybe shortens course infections patients recover (which plausible viral inhibitor like hydroxychloroquine hope for) promises enough vaccines public (i.e. people health care providers, military essential workers) maybe late 2021 early 2022. reams bad studies retracted papers waste time even read abstracts. People money able catch flight Taiwan, Singapore, South Korea, China, get vaccine way one available U.S. like order KN95 masks China still, 6 months coronavirus landed here, Fauci demonstrates inadequate woven cloth masks public claims protect people.

Your ignorance obvious make job teach information literally everywhere EXCEPT anything published stated US health officials professionals. mass gatherings people condemned stopped. Truth BLM protesters weren’t violent, rioters were. remember 400 cases lot... look us... 100% believing beginning, point I'm starting trust China Donny crew. largest single denomination far smaller Protestants. 

This simply wrong. 1.3 billion Catholics compared 900 million protestants (all denominations know Sabbath Saturday.

The point christians belong church teaches worship sabbath. history shows started changing 17th century largely antisemitism

This untrue. 

One earliest examples christian apologetics Justin Martyr(2nd century) writes [First apology, chapter Sunday day hold common assembly, first day God, wrought change darkness matter, made world; Jesus Christ Saviour day rose dead. crucified day Saturn (Saturday); day Saturn, day Sun, appeared apostles disciples, taught things, submitted also consideration.

Even earlier see christians worshiping Lord's Day rather sabbot. one earliest christian writings (which predates writings new testament) [The 14th chapter also states Christians worship Lords Day. 

There MANY references even first hundred years Christianity show Christians worshiped sunday, saturday, practice started LONG 17th century. even know pulled number based anything remotely historical. 

Almost everything said factually wrong, even matter differing interpretations, best tell making stuff up. going critique group least critique things ACTUALLY believe. ma'am sir. Fucking optional. torn. friends know want kids back mask. kids want go mask. ones know masking worry me. watch Heath services doc says may push back opening, anyway, start way early. Like mid summer go back school America, man hero homogenous Society actually cares people. Visited Italy many times..incredible people pride country history. Congrats county 102% icu capacity. still people mad indoor dining closed. SIGH. whole mask issue disregard anyone morally troubling. see power actively stopping measures protect people best little, late order protect political careers. 

The current political social environment encourage altruistic sacrifice health care workers act could well cost life.

Before ask someone risk lives taking care you, make sure everything possible others safe. live one America civic responsibility keep everyone safe healthy regardless politics. goes Asthma medication become generic 50 years ago sell patient every 9 years get fresh 10 years monopoly drug. Yep. headlines lost impact. break record many days row becomes normal. even though flirt SARS extent.

I'm curious people Toronto took COVID seriously experience SARS. Canada hardest-hit non-Asian country SARS epidemic. think something like 4th 5th highest number deaths world SARS. Brought paper promoting mass protest. far Florida's official response provide body bags refrigerator trailers.

Is real? actually this? still lockdown? theme parks requiring face shields wear mask. good, offers protection without restricting airways. 2 3 deaths *over 80 years old*.

1 4 deaths *over ninety years old*. Movie theaters, museums gyms apart phase 3 MA, allowed open week must stay 40% capacity people spread out.Still lot places choosing stay closed little longer. lol, silly bot. teacher primarily disadvantaged children hear *oodles* negative effects children schools:

You know *really* negative effect child's life future success? Losing goddam parent. point case case *case* students I've taught lost parent suffered greatly academically psychologically.

Now add inexorable guilt child place upon believing ones brought virus home, even can't proven. Apparently invading vikings popular w/ ladies great britain around 1000 ac hygiene. took bath every week groomed beard hair ;-) Probably planning ahead. US bought 90% world supply remdesivir next 3 months. they're probably putting number hopes get next months. I'm expert vaccines, guess would vaccine rated 15 years past point larger percentage recipients enough antibodies prevent infection. varies person person, may still reduced infection, could explain decreased mortality decrease infection rate, that's feel everyone get booster. 
Of course could also pharma companies tested antibody levels 15 years out, decided far enough figured could make money testing longer requiring booster. expiration dates meds. Many drugs last past date box, companies can't guarantee bother test longer. US military saved billions stockpiled meds expired tested still found potent. would easier make list handled worse. I'm 40, I'm good? argument going college? ""it's tough expensive."" course small loan million dollars would help. guess mass protests looting far impactful church gatherings. St Lukes shuttered last November due lack patient demand. provide 330 ICU beds supposedly standby. Staffing may another issue. spent 4.1 million dollars federal taxpayer money renovating it. self-solving problem. Let masses commence! Welcome party! nearly 4 months late, somehow still better Florida. people reaction seatbelts mandated? bizarre. remember helmets kids became mandatory 90s recall issues. instances terms non invasive health safety measures reaction occurred? aunt likely one these. 2 teachers kids too, old enough bail yet. Idiots still spread virus go home, regardless who's blame. would nice people voluntarily stopped vacationing surging states think shutting tourism actually stop it. governor blame shutting imho Awesome. Well done getting it. Love U.K. Probably drinking.. mean technically refusing wear mask political expression would be, way PACs make anonymous donations political expression.

But not. literally life-saving tool  mask mandate city mayors. uneducated mayor Apache Junction running Pinal County board supervisors. So, declined make masks mandatory political reasons. Would like tackle think Canadian, we're celebrating way early. see lot Northern states getting hit hard covid right now? really. 

It ton geography bit ""Handled It"". 

I also think raise ""mission accomplished"" banner early Unfortunately eradication need way testing need catch without symptoms still sick two months got infected despite lockdown. would much easier lockdown numbers would way lower. see cycle manifesting? People getting laid losing insurance. cant go doctor get tested assume dont it.  go get new job, possibly asymptomatic. virus spreads another lockdown begins people lose jobs again. next years. two-way street though. famous people wrote *Governments derive power consent governed*. excuse ineptitude Administration several States, can't solely blamed failing pass measures people would never obey. I'm glad government citizenry page here. That’s true, ones asking to. aren’t conscripting general population become doctors nurses. It’s also true responsibility actively infect people deadly disease. second thought India gonna get us, never lost faith Florida man's abilities. Thanks. happened ages ago easy forget since everything turned ok, imagine hard hitting adult recover nearly quickly kid can. don’t imagine. I’m living it. Lol Kill kid. Open school. teachers staff too. many stupid people. Sounds almost like people protesting months ago everyone said haircuts definitely adds confusion. deaths stay low infections high...what do? rest world accept? earth happening? Yes think wages across companies same. want attract quality workers need stay competitive part stable wage. think people want job reduce wages move. People want stability. 

I think longer Covid situation goes companies get permanently board full remote. It'll interesting see plays out. I'm hoping Covid speed necessary changes needed society. Yes. Whether they're anxious mask supposed freedom taken away, wearing mask irrational. call idiots like, think mental health issue. almost feels like everyone US anxious now. I'm sure would government's leadership neighbors enough stop global pandemic killing you. agree this. literally provided one example tried pass rest separate incidents everything related covid.

And again, infected people breaking quarantine. punishing.

I however gonna punish people disease breaking laws prevent spread disease. it, cannot spread it. Get fucking skull. Yeah wonder ultimately dying of. Cytokine storm? Blood clots? Florida backlogged. cant even complete tests they've taken. aware means no? Numbers saturated seen 8 10k cosistant. positivity rate also reflects this. Already bro, pm insider trading what'll happen next! Thanks info! got swab test yesterday worry false negative. symptoms almost 2 weeks since exposure, overly cautious. Trump administration competent would called big retailers Walmart, Amazon, HomeDepot etc... anywhere N95 available large supply asks pulled shelves immediately, well crisis became apparent. masks buy can't run.

Then explain public pulled them. necessary medical workers, small part big kit protective gear front line workers desperately need, general public better approach homemade cloth mask social distancing. Say something need wear mask, please leave N95 masks medical workers. Wearing N95 mask without gloves face shields like soldier birthday suit thinking needs put helmet. need full kit including N95 front line medical workers storming beaches Normandy. everyone else best protection avoid battlefield social distance, routinely wear reusable cotton mask activities (like grocery shopping) lower risk contact inevitable. Deja Vu moment. accidental autodefenestration. No, wait, one reserved health care workers spoke lack PPE. bad. Yes. read news reports refrigerator trailers, call nurses. never 100% vaccine.

...come again? study 2007, 82% patients pneumonia + sepsis (31% pneumonia patients study developed sepsis) elevated cytokine levels. 

You would need similar data figure out. doubt much data de-identified warehoused yet. Might worth look see there's COVID registry. person struck fever, plague leprosy, quarantined outside camp LEAST seven days. Longer depending severity infection. Oh that's completely brilliant, bumpkin. Utterly, sickeningly brilliant. 

""Hey guys. We're 100% sure guy sick deadly pathogen, we're going quarantine 2 weeks sure get people killed. 

Oh. What's that? want to? 

Well, shit. Guess gotta roll dice people's lives.

YOLO!"" Religion killing people years. stop now? /s Yeah. would feel like total shit old person church got infected me, hardly national news. particular paper sketchy think theory sound. multiple legitimate papers VWF Well, that's one thing agree asshat on. Stop getting tested? fuck idiot? many fear dont get collective power. try everywhere usually meetings crickets speak behind like five people agree ive said.... speak fuck people Yh man, I'm sorry retarded parents. market street tenderloin absolute war zones rn ""Even children"" necessarily mean children affected. describe way states. Old young, even children dying US. see different.
 

The one thing different says respiratory distress common symptom anymore, gastrointestinal, *that* new. Yes GI symptom beginning, common presenting one. 

We shall see. statistically better chance getting sexually abused catching Covid step church....Ahhhhhhh...men getting sick people end world. pray disappears like Trump says (lmao), enjoy new life time being. 

Or realistically, hope make drug medicine combats COVID, take time. vaccine, medicine would work. Probably around 2M dead, many problems caused disease. unlikely go far - many states good. Look Amazon MERV-13 16 *furnace filters*. cardboard frame holds sheet filter material that, removed flattened out, 2x3 feet. tedious part removing thin metal wires hold filter wave shape use furnace. apart (it glued together) cut filter material rectangles 3x5 inches use mask. videos around YouTube showing it. also need ""Maxipads"" also take apart get absorbant layer - go behind filter material, absorb moisture breath keep somewhat scratchy filter skin. make sense. first goal prevent healthcare system overwhelmed - make sure everyone gets best possible treatment. Then, second goal reduce proportion population caught covid - keep possible lifelong effects. 3rd goal eradication people go back normal (somewhat ambitious many places right now).

Using 'degree herd immunity' prevent cases senseless - already got cases!!

Israel screwed re-opening somewhere (too fast? enough TTI?).

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* park also sued Amy Acton, (at time) director Ohio Department Health signing order keep people there. I've lost respect establishment. post post calling Covid hoax, gaslighting people wear mask. likely seems do. many idiots going lose lives? many already lost it? dangerous idiots everywhere. Deaths magically disappeared stop updating numbers daily bases. Nobody asked this. one wants it. fucking sucks virtually every human earth. cant pretend problem doesn’t exist reality inconvenient. solve problem that’s adults do. Sticking head sand doesn’t fix shit, actively makes problem worse. could give less fuck anti-vaxxers.

Once get vaccine choke ventilator. 100% agree nationwide available vaccine October? candy land living in? Yeah also Canada we're ""we"" ""me"" country. 

Which got virus control hurry they're disease riddled trash fire. Probably bad translation poor writing, likely meant much higher gastro issues along breathing issues. went funeral St Louis Monday really well done. Masks required. Sanitizer required door out. Every row blocked off. space immediate families.

Not say like everywhere surprised. Still think God would forgive skipped weekly service. thing, church get enough money online giving easier forget donating online, rather forget donating there. find people refuse wear masks abhorrent, also see cancel culture way. trend recording, doxxing, trying get people fired fun game people like. becomes normalized though, expect used unsavory actors. yourselves. Hire single security guard sit beat people without masks It’s already New Zealand left, island small, contact tracing travel restrictions super easy.  Can't say blame them, fact teachers spend entire lives going school must tiring



""o.O' additional federal unemployment end too. Yes, however live hotspot United States whole doesn’t matter. Arizona hospitals almost full, activated surge care, intake tents outside hospital emergency rooms filling. deaths trending up. protests certainly help, biggest cause spike. protesters wear masks took place outside. also seen massive spikes cities lockdowns massive protests like San Francisco.

Obviously spike caused reopening indoor businesses America's general refusal wear masks. Maybe! that's case articles I've read state it.

That said, there's lots negative immune responses affect subset people. E.g. us worry anaphylaxis shellfish carry around epipens. Yeah I'm point suing. tough. America protects business lot. safety agency OSHA even show complaint made 9 times 10. send email saying ""hey employee says wrong. Email us back response.""

Then business goes ""oh always compliance idea talking about!"" that's end it. know? sign name complaint (most fear) sign get copies everything Freedom Information Act. email exchanges OSHA work hilariously unprofessional flat lies.

Then got Mitch Senate trying get businesses immunity even though even taking steps keep employees safe. yet show even one inaccurate statement Fauci, evidence statement incorrect. know people Asian countries Americans don't? wear f**ing look non-cleansing restrictions, restrictions due pathogens common time. exactly point.

The customer - meaning marketplace - always right.

Beta ""better"" VHS. matter. Customer always right.

It intended empower single assholes. (Just assholes groups.) think us aware types incidences direct result Republican distrust campaign responsible health crisis intervention supercede authority. That's likely big part it. probably scenario states opened testing. month ago (or so) Florida, seeing average \~46 positives day 0-14 year old age groups. we're seeing \~536 day. bulk kids would never tested couple months ago state testing people multiple symptoms. Yeah I'm really sure. Also, many great movies even right lol?  race bottom. really NYT would that? go Internet publish something religion like scary alien concept? Every single developed nation planet plenty developing handled better. Vietnam handled better. Sitting nervously Arizona. Someone office sick three days, got tested Monday means good chance take 7+ days find result. falls 50% office refuses wear masks too. coworker office denied test yesterday sick guy’s test result doesn’t prove covid yet. diabetes high blood pressure too. probably read legal definition “clear present danger” “presumption innocence” would explain difference. Stay home stay safe stay healthy is. Singapore. totally different disease. Jail still punishment violation.

It's almost lots countries see infection disease violations crimes, lots disgusting deplorables think muh freedumbs important lives others.

Lovely person are. Simply adorable. 

Wait. That's deplorable.
My bad. Aka... outhouse basically. lot sanitary everyone shit leave middle camp. there’s vaccine? Duh. Everyone done better United States. 'Murica! bet nickel HR's radar already, excited saw video. Seeing Florida probably packing too, even scary. prediction setting us Christmas death spike: colleges universities open fall. assess students represent low risk population there’s money made wrap right words around argument spite data. 

The virus quickly spread throughout university communities. Mini quarantine cycles established. November students go home family holidays. Grandparents visit. college students give grandparents. grandparents take back retirement community. massive spike occurs 4 weeks later Christmas. Yes stuff like work. “school usual”. someone, gonna say who, pushing else withdraw funds. don’t pay taxes, get tax payer funds, help spread deadly virus? Yeah fuck religion together. ever devil, it’s religion. Fair... good points. much add that, personally seem fine. far. course necessarily apply everyone.  said churchgoer enough faith that's got sick. Same. bad there's 2 instances violence shitheads refusing. roll student loan, worries! US? /s No, movie theaters opened Phase 3 two days ago. They'll open city Boston next Monday. Limited capacity theaters obviously. Idk California That's true. large, April May. know talking about.

But welcome try convince otherwise. Yeah going dinner, this, that, resulting bullshit resulting bullshit, dont that, this, fun forbidden, blood, sweat tears allowed, yadda yadda.

Its dinner, fucking shitload inconveniences problems running long. 

I going gut life put hold scared something. going strange contradiction. us actually lead world obesity. title goes Nauru. fact us even top 10. Got tested yesterday day vomiting liquid shits. confirm. Yes. :-)

I remember time lot people seeming think meant “patients left die” realizing EMT-speak “leaving dead body place”. Deaths up, sitting around 450 right I’m pretty sure it’s due weekend back log. uptick starting hitting really bad june 18th.  Average 22 28 days infection death. Lag 2 10 days report death. already see giant uptick hospitilations. younger sure hopsitilised means bad enough great concern wellbeing. mention people dont die.. people contract virus may life long illnesses. Guy hero, would fucked without him. What's gist? 134,420

edit: aw another downvote :( Better him. I’m nobody, even could handled better.......LITERALLY shutting mouth stepping aside letting people know they’re talking speak, urging people listen heed expert advice. US facing additional business challenges countries opening travel excluding US. Critical business travel shit US competition. know something coming sooner later. matter picking horrible idea he'll act next. completely trust Beijing 100%

&amp;#x200B;

says nobody never 100% vaccine. vaccine reduce deaths, estimates, good idea effective years later.

If force 7 billion people take vaccine, actually quite likely kill people virus. 

There nightmare, similar flu healthy. young healthy risk MUCH less flu. what? like it, go church. Leave others alone (I know, really hard Reddit do). It’s pretty easy social distance outdoors wearing mask. Indoors drinking booze isn’t quite thing see mask convertible valve/straw. us first half I'm gonna lie Wednesday 9,989 new cases, 48 deaths 333 hospitalizations.

Sounds like 3% 3 days till shit hits fan Literally every country handled better US Nearly half world population Asia also wants know ... Yeah sad whole mask situation got mixed politics. can’t wait till November guy isn’t office anymore. Gee, almost ""run government like business"" leads shitty results, especially country business incentivized pursue short-term gains cost, including expense long-term strategy. nearly know degree people going fucked up. 

But evidence seems leaning toward scary high probability shit ton permanently damaged people. 
So got going us. 
Which (not) nice. I'm sick behaviour. Employees need start standing holding scumbags accountable. That's good point, Catholic Church course considered representing ""country"" Vatican owning land stuff countries. made entire situation seem even absurd observation! No. Churches breeding grounds religious* followers blindly fall line cult-leader public servants enact laws affect everyone. say churches can’t taxed fact churches overtly harm citizens every country.

I’m atheist-agnostic

e: apparently I’m wrong thread, b. That's equivalent here, though, cases there's prior knowledge virus, intent spread it. would akin making law states found given somebody HIV, whether knew it, convicted premeditated murder.

Also, I'd recommend research laws. They're quite controversial immense amount harm. Here's good starting resource: optional

I hope that's typo meant Masks Required. Wtf talking about? Let's see DeSantis reacts that. What's gonna mobilize National Guard open schools? Unless testing getting results daily waste time money. Maryland taking 3-5 days get results testing sites/labs. purpose? goes office, look back tremendous job creating COVID hot pockets school systems. People love enough, getting back them. loved more.

&amp;#x200B;

I also think Barron first student walk doors public school Washington DC. make decent one t-shirt. Four layers materials though, one two. Keep safe. I'm fine risking lungs life based 'less likely' reports I've seen show long lasting damage. people longer make around block 'recovered' 

Not worth it. take proper precautions stop trying play it. Look lines Arizona perfect world would listening scientists wearing masks social distancing. real world De Santis lot people's source information looking beyond rosy colored story what's happening.  highly specific well publicized case young man won’t reflect average age, economic, health education background 99% Coronavirus patients. 


This sound like. Death rates may going up. reason we’re seeing lag necessarily. pretty obvious states manipulating data. Florida 6x usual pneumonia deaths year, lying justify reopening. agree everything said except stock market really volatile since March/early April. part Ah, meant want face reality way like seeing stats numbers deaths/cases, talking people experienced hearing truth it, etc. apologise, see badly worded, mean really hope get Covid-19 die it. Hopefully Nancy Nordland types quitting good ones returning work. I'm making assertions. Doctors healthcare professionals are. Hospitals need conspire anything. following CDC guidelines. Nobody saying virus fake. saying cases inflated places, namely US. government forced hospitals close rooms, people scared visit hospitals. since covid way get funding right now, choice list every patient possibly covid. Nobody said conspiracy, pretty common knowledge 

""you people""

I'm part group. I'm relaying information common knowledge. We've never spoken I'm sure ""changes hour"". course. anyone think not? went Walmart last week pretty much saw employees wearing masks, around chins... time move customer service military service.

These days, shopping grocery store privilege taken granted. doesnt feel threatened.....he feels entitled superior.

Hence t-shirt says. thinks 15th amendment make person wear face mask contains coronavirus local school Facebook group parents fighting masks. think least half looking homeschooling. daisy chain aspect economic impact something know anyone tracking.

A friend's son diagnosed weeks ago.

The dad engineer required go office since office, mom teacher private school ongoing classes online.

Now dad isolate two weeks even getting paid, workload affected. son released hospital 100% recovered, mom spending day caring him, give teaching hours last week, possibly another week getting paid.

That's assuming going catch it, would screw income another weeks assuming complications. id say actually crucial development, still dangerous feel like understand human behavior. president, governors, mayors etc. one's position implement recommendations doctor's scientists who's important here. kids want learn learn. kids muting online classes kids listen person.

Homeschooled kids usually pretty smart. effectiveness online learning comes good parenting suitable home environment, pressure good parenting. need edit correct post, current data, copied pasted reply below. elaborate post below, trend down, trend going back up. 

Whoops! Didn’t notice daily death rate. I’ll keep looking source total death rate per million, unless handy? Edit: found one - July 1: USA 388.93 deaths per million Canada 233.41 deaths per million ""Jefferson Smith Elementary lawsuit filed state level officials allowed reopen knowingly exposing children undue risks!"" even children dead ICU.

Trump cannot defund BUPKISS here. funds meted Congress. give states. river doesn’t run Sea Cortez all, much less enough water hospital ship. 2020 culture /smh careful may get sick due reckless actions others unfortunately :( responding comment made changing “facts” time. feel expected change learn time. I’ve wondering same. fact can’t imagine DeSantis interfering death case reports hands approach I'm pretty sure US high score, means we're winning...that's works right?! one tightly would ever smoked. Would help rage though. people really believe piece porous tissue *actually* blocks CO2 gas inside, oxygen outside??? (as think they’re breathing CO2).

I wonder kind programs teach US elementary schools? Nothing physics chemistry?

If case, could solve carbon emissions sticking mask cars exhaust factories.

Thankfully don’t bullcrap Japan, masks worn day long regardless pandemic almost industries, general population flu hay seasons. Ok riots actually lowered covid cases amazing someone unintelligent use reddit,  really need work reading comprehension attempting talk people otherwise look idiotic currently do.

I'll help though.

You need understand that's years life lives thing.

Jesus Christ amazing stupid people be. wasn't, day Misses McMahon donated crap ton money, change them... Well know happened awful lot know original text commands that. remember line ""have dealings gods.""

I understand point belief system used justify genocide throughout Europe beyond. Well thing lot people live cities. roles partial onsite needs, like network engineers, IT, management, likely find people city Tulsa, OK.

Also issue described article office leases. can't move office downsize time renew, need cut costs, it'd new hires existing staff primarily.

You're right time it'll go price, would result companies already adopting strategy. means it'll happen regardless. 

We may see sort waxing waning new approach settles. Again, see smarter bet smaller office spaces partial full WFH roles. 

A curious thought experiment may see wages INCREASE initially, people indeed live big cities change while. cut costs getting smaller office spaces, may increase wages stay competitive. see lasting. 

Good news may solve affordable housing problem. office buildings may become residential properties, rents go time slow skyrocketing increases. Depends mask sure It’s actually rather easy. state bar exams different things. see clotting hospitalizations know everyone clots ends hospital.

Are controlling clotting might result ventilations? protests either large and/or came country question managed limit spread coronavirus.  could see correlation coming. happened 1720 worse?  Lucky symptoms week! Sounds like wife lot. random fevers, fatigue could continue while. I’m nearing 4 months it. Resting going best thing do. especially challenging continue rest, things feel normal. I’ve learned hard way go normal, terrible, hours, days. It’s never really worth whatever activities thought *had* do, time. 

Fish oil (omega 3) one take every day. Vitamin D, C, B12, too. Magnesium. Whatever else liquid vitamins. Lots people include NAC, zinc covid stuff. also make personal challenge eat many extra veggies fruits can, since that’s get lazy. believe anti inflammatory diet key us. wasn’t exhausted, I’d top it. 😌 retailers right. make mandatory nation wide wear mask indoor public buildings transport. could also add mask rule outdoor places keeping distance easily possible like marketplaces. forbid group meetings close bars clubs. USA huge numbers drastic measure needed get numbers down. Fuck idiots, deserve shamed. Good! Let religious nuts die (: Yes.    
Rushmore could ""burning Reichstag "" moment.   
Step one.........blow Lincoln's portrait.   
Step two.........scribble BLM somewhere near base.   
Step three......hide bunker. Possibly thing agree ""gov"" done FL relating covid. good comes killing kids. Well damn scientific mystery covid spread solved VA bar, need burn ties pandemic over. Thinking back, probably heard NPR, find article regarding antibody testing US: like Iceland best testing per capita (135/1000 citizens) time publication: median CFI 0.55%: Population density helped Trudeau go dance. Meanwhile America:

*""Some may die, that's sacrifice...I willing make.""* Yeah, sad happened whole Situation. Reddit American users website? know guys serious isolationism horrible. 

thousands dead one second before! theaters part phase4? Gotta careful Iowa said cities can't mandate face certainly possible given class viruses pretty well known seems less likely something different viral family. Sounds like funeral. Wakes generally happen churches include religious services. wonderful! many times get say anything covid related. No. quite didn't. proven beyond dispute utterly deplorable. I’m Michigan well area (southeast Michigan) appears most, all, schools least offering online option regardless phase in. 

I know doesn’t help parents make kids go hopes parents keep kids home year ultimately cut (and rest staffs) exposure. 

I can’t believe anyone thinks opening schools good anyone point. miss Dr. Acton. Aw angry lil guy. LA public health website says 2k POSITIVE test results backlog me. fair also assume people refuse wear mask also don’t social distance increase hand washing etc? Ergo, even risk others simply wearing mask. one different. held Maricopa County Director Public Health time. true, denying fact, US still completely fucking entire situation. hate seeing unfunny/irony joke comment every post. That's exactly point, location matters. passing law conflicts constitutional rights, must compelling state interest state must use ""narrowly tailored means."" instance, state could easily defend requiring masks grocery stores, would hard time requiring masks public settings means could considered broad. example, fine wearing mask empty parking lot would likely declared unconstitutional.

I lawyer, lawyer explained argument me. Sorry, get from? Sorry something said came like that, tell is? Positivity rate among 4 highest states: 

Ranged 10.3 percent 19.3 percent last two weeks Agreed. articles like see many people commenting like new information anyone paying attention start this, old news. Blows mind Goddamn hard could find another solution? Definitely understand that, recently created sourdough starter kinds things totally affects way bread loaves come out. Get tested let work know exposed. Right everyone gets infected Newsom backbone. wait til CA gets NY whole thing started. happens, it'll late That's schools opening, I'm talking students/parents refusing send kids. show neighbours  watched Serbian Film hundred times - immune covid! Trump two years build wall. failed get done. 

He could made deal Mexico control border better. He's deal maker failed. point Mexican border kind useless anyway, show Mexico brought cases States States brought onto themselves. 

Democrats can't inflame anything Trump making beautiful deals. Democrats stop Trump sitting BLM leaders negotiating? hide White House bunker?

How calling someone racist stop job? sort person can't soldier bravely people call names?

And yes, seem pretty clear everyone looking outside one party done everything hurt America. hand never disappoints. Convenient, reliable efficient. hi &lt;3  lol well needed laugh today....🤣🤣🤣 Ok looked bit depth. average temp Ohio Jul average temp FLA Jun.

The 3 day running avg new daily cases FLA 53/ million Jun.
The 3 day running avg new daily cases Ohio today 70/million 

Very close correlation think point myriad articles churches spreading Covid media relatively silent protests. also telling blame number cases many places placed opening Memorial Day look back preceded 10-20 days protests. Combine fact it’s largely younger people getting seems logically point one direction. could lot reasons different areas different dynamics. That’s poster trying say believe it’s probably legit discussion. Well one, like support “business syndicates” fact actually hate globalization economies big businesses.... almost much hate socialists communists... digress, yes monarchism flaws, hundreds years withstood test time, fact monarchies existed around time virus would snuffed out, instead bureaucracy weak politicians fighting votes monarch best nation matter backlash, besides strong central leader backbone true nation.... look Prussian ideals.... idk I’m even arguing, bolsheviks communists cannot reasoned with, oh btw fact thought “monopoly monarchist” rude assumptions make ass :) thanks destructive criticism, added point—- 15,000,000 Lenin, 20,000,000 (that know of) Stalin, 50,000,000 Mao Zedong, unknown millions kims, hundreds thousands USSR’s grip nations like Hungary Poland, knows many more? Venezuela Cuba? uighur population concentration camps Chinese Communist Party, know dumb ass nation caused whole pandemic couldn’t handle public backlash, want realize monarchism far safer socialist communist ideology. that, fact. Furlough stock holders instead. Sheesh. World Warcraft cars? article give details I'm hoping testing people mild symptoms testing whole family one person gets infected. assume shown otherwise. Phase 4 closer Phase 1, state money. That’s Newsom didn’t order statewide closures spike, certain counties. happened March certainly would closed everything  calmly step podium take sip water run screaming room. would accurately summarize covid situation Maricopa. Except bathing widespread middle ages going way back romans, literally stopped plague since bathhouses got singled infection hotspots large number people frequented daily basis.

Good hygiene enough protect disease. Indoor plumbing providing clean water &amp; sewage disposal everyone free real public health revolution stamped many diseases first world. missed point entirely then. nice day believe response recent story came said majority tests producing false positives, also reports tests coronavirus it. 🤷‍♂️ yes elephant thats probably real reason he's saying this. can't even fathom someone ok 5 kids per school.

Read polio epidemic like sometime. 1957 influenza epidemic. parents grandparents watched kids drop like flies comparison 2020. Life went grand scheme things missing year class education save lives worthy trade eyes.

What stretches two years? five? ten? new pandemics heels one? Hypothetically speaking, would draw line? many children would spend childhoods shut-ins? Oh snap. Apply water burn gents. pathogens.  guilt trip, virtue signalling, want eyes see ""generosity"", see ""good"" people CDC guidance reporting Covid deaths incredibly lenient certifying Covid deaths. total count Covid-19 deaths per CDC probable cases don’t require confirmation via laboratory hard believe people died Alzheimer’s, dementia, heart disease, diabetes, etc... hospital admissions way patients isolated long term care facilities. LA like 4 million people California 40 million people. LA spikes everywhere else evens goes spike flattened data combined. Bold Omari daily reminder worse leaders trump xi. No, actually paying attention. never 2 weeks catching covid till death. confusing incubation period 2 weeks heard quit listening. 

You come contact covid.

within 2 weeks sick.

could another week go hospital.

fight average 3 weeks die. (for people die)

then new code must entered manually, another week goes entering death.

&amp;#x200B;

these low end times. could take 2 weeks enter deaths hospital overrun. people fight longer hospital. 

so, simple math see 2 weeks, weeks, gets talked about. current explosion cases started little 3 weeks ago. going rise deaths, logically assume begin pivot early next week. exponentially turn following week. Following path current explosion cases. . certainly bad move sometimes, completely depends situation.

Regardless, alternative people use every day, numerous times throughout day, great success. point vs tens millions dead short time due major war Russia China (or maybe India &amp; Pakistan nuke other, India &amp; China, etc) plus similar wars periodic basis going forward.

You idea remarkably stable world actually right now. part virtually national borders intact essentially never challenged. *not* historical norm. What's wrong talking loud Honestly, already begun without colleges. past weeks I've seen amount Texas counties reporting ~100 cases day rise ~8 25 yesterday.

You're right though, colleges going touch previously (relatively) unscathed college towns generally quiet summer break. Great let's build seven hundred million units start with. ready? Well guess going stay lockdown years arent we? I’ve doctor plenty times. know goes on. get scalpel?

The general public sees maybe 15-20% actually goes teacher’s job. Great teachers make look effortless. must amazing teachers realise. university pay tests? Last checked, college kids broke cost covid test daunting say least. Probably good sign slow walking bad news  crime disclose people around refuse quarantine. rate death growth may lower before, cases keep increasing, course absolute deaths. young people die rate &lt;0.1%, old people die rate deaths always increase cases increase. 

But higher mix young vs old, means less deaths per 100 cases. big part going (along time lag, better treatments, maybe virus non-lethal mutations, etc.). know avg age infected declining, thus know big reason less deaths per 100 cases going now. Yea, sucks true. #1 economy, reopen everything disregard human life eventually lead #1 covid cases mortality damages come it. I’m NC, see sentiment friends country. 

There needs concerted community effort stop spread. can’t place burden schools we’ve got people throwing hissy fits Costco wear mask. everyone started wearing masks stopped parties might chance avoiding school outbreaks. 

Schools put sanitation social distancing measures possible place, still outbreaks little Jimmy’s parents took uncle Joe’s 50 person birthday. everyone Texas lives near Houston, Austin DFW. That's happens people trust government. got stuck man prefers attack side. agreed choice. Die home die debt hospital. America freedom. Omg 100 new cases.

The world ending. Yeesh...i think safe say opened back quickly... Idiot emphasis “I.” don’t believe US recognized world power later 19th century. don’t think super power status WW2. Well, 60k infected day growing exponentially, population 300M, infected months? need wandering aisles well. I’ve seen people pull mask soon they’re inside. Covid higher death rate America HIV.  would that? liberal hoax went away late April /s Remind 2 weeks. t-shirt says all. Ugly-American white male angry power, type guy scared, hence ""feels threatened"". Seems like type shoot school workplace. government.  FEEL THREATENED! BACK UP!  mean Sweden, country 5th deaths per capita? Tokyo 100 new cases yesterday still restrictions like wearing masks? might want rethink “normal” is. Deaths rising infections Would say actual level social interaction returned pre-pandemic levels? 

They returned pre-pandemic levels, returned social interaction full lockdown March 27th. 

Restaurants booming, yes mask free. Nobody wears masks here. 

Most pubs re-opened limits numbers (officially) seated (officially). 

All businesses open. Shops busy. staff wearing masks. 

About half workforce work offices still working home becuse schools holidays. 

Kids summer camps playing streets groups. 

While social interation increased, still respectful degree social distancing. much interaction weeks full lockdown (ie., first measures introduced) way last 8-10 weeks. 

None effect downward curve. said - peak reached constant lockdown level - measures increasingly lifted, curve still trends downwards. conviction 4 months ago needed it? Fauci trash California putting death, fucked big time! according nurse spoke to. Ceiling mounted web cam, projector put remote students wall screen think main question go back Phase 1. Phase 4? fucking kidding me? never catch coronavirus one simple trick. Doctors HATE Makes sense - thx. see note Worldometer. holiday lag bound create abnormal spikes. expect report what's happening?

If provided timely information past six months, would start now? NYC many died home EMTs couldn’t get quickly enough — C19 patients crash quickly 😣. devastating EMTs. $20 $20 shocking people believe God could believe something stupid. [Think good things years ago, wife video.

Germany started open, dance again, fairly strict rules.

It get better. Dad NAFA guy. super useful helping (architect) evaluate HVAC systems used environments limiting spread contagious diseases issue. article hilarious. exactly suppression looks like. read comment said can't eliminate virus suppresses mass dissemination vaccine.

As far tell. seems Canada approach, well Australia New Zealand approach. mainland Europe too. 

Also equate United States Sweden doing. Sweden still trying surpress virus. voluntary measures. 

The guidelines Swedish government pushed different countries did. good quote BBC:

*His words cut heart government's strategy here: self-responsibility. 

We adults need exactly that: adults. spread panic rumours 

No one alone crisis, person heavy responsibility.*

 well neighbours. That's true. Swedes deserve credit voluntarily right thing. 

Fortunately Sweden large freedumb movement thinks behaving like adult, educated, listening know attack Freedumbs.

The problem Fox US Freedom press made Sweden strategy something not. used justification lunacy. said outside public sidewalk. makes difference you're, long private parts covered, issue we're difficulty finding enough staff grow new beds we've added.

Healthcare workers going burnt this. protests thousands people yet state decline three weeks. 

Many protesters wore masks; wouldn’t blame protests much I’d blame bars,
churches, political events block parties. Mayor Miami suspects house parties also major factor. may blind. Could please quote made generalization Americans, cuz can't see it. analogy reference something Jr posted years ago. compared Syrian refugees poisoned Skittles. basically saying shouldn’t let refugees in, one two might terrorists. Yeah, well. Coronavirus task force said okay go back school student’s parents go back work.  scientist know anything.

yeah, talking things, clearly know nothing about. im shaking head scientists experts think know field expertise general public smh /s stopped listening Birx said amazing Donald grasped nuances pandemic quickly. obviously false, hence reason trust her. immunity something herd GIVES vulnerable individuals.

Because enough people shuts transmission virus. ""everybody gets it"". 

Do understand that?

regarding varicella virus, understand never clear it, infected virus life? buries immune system, come back times stress old age immune system weaker can't contain it. 

Again, claiming person infected virus immune virus. Umm, no, infected it. like saying HIV+ immune HIV. No, it. ....okay? analogy, Trump TV telling feed kid Skittles? pace, US recording 100,000 positive cases per day August 9th.

This pace 11 days faster [six days \* ( ln(100000/2948052) - ln(1 - (2948052/2596323)^(-1/7)) ) / ln(2948052/2596323) = 34.9 days

The world (still) see 300,000 cases per day July 29:

7 \* ( ln(300000/11480979) - ln(1 - (11480979/10162295)^(-1/7)) ) / ln(11480979/10162295) = 23.7 days

See [this post formula Bwaahahhahaa. need money come back well help get heaven faster!!! live rural Kansas .... state says masks, county says aren’t enforcing, recommended wearing optional. I’ve wearing masks public places since March continue get looked like I’ve got 3 heads showed nekked. Tbf jacksonville (and florida) also running short. Everywhere that's seeing spike struggling.
But total BS pop testing site problem keep safe areas struggling. Hell 5k extra tests would much useful Miami right 27% pos rate. I'm pretty sure learned driving school, allowed drive 45 mph windows down. Idk maybe locale thing person evidence claims either. collective trauma Papa Giovanni XXIII hospital experienced something impossible quantify. hospital reached base capacity early, beginning march, 10 days nationwide lockdown, doctors/nurses expand day day (for 3-4 weeks) capacity everything could found. 

Covid patients only, everywhere.

Urologists every doctor nurse learn deal intensive care patients, deal mechanical ventilation ARDS. around 30 daily hospital deaths only, peak. 

Patients moved Lombardy first, northern Italy, entire Italy. Deads moved well away Bergamo. Strange, John Hopkins us 51.8k cases yesterday. gots cherry picking deep bush find 60k thinking along lines Spaceballs President Skroob direct analogue asteroid comment above, probably accurate. lol Worth nothing Worldometer uses different time zone, 24 hour period measures offset US stats 5-8 hours I'm Germany would like order Amazon product Japan.

At least good job. They're drinking death. me? wow. people vote. faith humanity rapidly dwindling Ah. Thanks. can't? Give shot, I'd suggest avoiding schools playgrounds though. Agreed certain extent. state officially Phase 2 means essential businesses low-risk workplaces open. However Newsom allowed every county apply move ahead state folded every one backpedaling specific measures, full phases. 

So official CA roadmap says we're Phase 2, individual county ""Phase 3, restrictions"". disorderly situation make much sense. We've got gyms open indoor dining, zoos closed office work done remotely open. great situation. choice call law enforcement, may may anything. Literal sheriff's offices refusing enforce orders exist.

A store always report someone trespassing get kicked out. sheriffs going force people wear masks. They'd still force someone leave private property owner wants person out. Schrödinger’s Flu gave first solid laugh least 24 hours. Well done. brain damaged! think that's issue handled it. 

High density + good handling masks wearing = ok

High density + bad handling (NYC) = utter nightmare retailers need show leadership grow fucking balls. store. make rules. EASILY hire mall cop sit front store turn away anyone mask.  

This weak they're afraid requiring masks make look bad certain demographic idiots. state requires shift blame. 

CEOs need show actual leadership enforce rule themselves. charge billion dollar companies can't figure make people wear masks deserve charge. 28 Days Later. real. wanna get specific, every apostle born Jew. liter 80% alcohol times.

That's one way justify walking around fifth ever clear. think mean *government overreach!* AMIRITE?  would somewhat accept type blood advantage offsetting covids, beyond put much stake claims like type susceptible it.

I’m therapy, take meds, none changes fucked are, none changes hopeless it, none helps futures. doesn’t matter. doesn’t matter. Years. It’s going years this. Fucking years. can’t fucking it. can’t even take another week. nothing look forward too. nothing. care anyone wants do. can't without distancing it. Church, protests, air guitars battles. IDC is. Unfortunately seems one follows rules let alone proper mask usage. Pretty much everyone saying... till vaccine, new normal. Memphis Nashville metro areas face masks requirements Alabama thing, article Alabama. studied minority populations across country, would likely common causes nationwide (like poverty) causes specific certain states, regions, communities. Alabama, challenges probably little different inner city populations rural Black Belt counties. I'm betting CCP responsive GOP. China...... Implying right day worship... ignored guidelines better. certainly case right now.

Except case. fared best ignored almost fronts even speaking them. said months H2H happening/proven countries already provided evidence took precautions it. said masks help countries anecdotal/scientific evidence went mandatory masks almost instantly. said close borders/limit air travel countries closed borders China almost immediately Italy US (and everyone closing borders US even though said help). said asymptomatic spread happen countries already demonstrated took precautions (masks). said little risk countries months went back edited documents show late countries assumed risk. asked everyone close borders China/stop international airtravel outside China, thing would 3 months ago.

The literally zero credibility I'm glad US pulled even though know things world global health help. bungled last three epidemics fucking bad lost reputation. one ever listen again. bet know why, too; every heard phrase, “Can’t con honest man”? Kinda feeling generation wawasan 2020. Fall shift gets hit harder. south starts running without A/C north turns heat on. moment find parents pretending illegal would stop opening window family road trips?  another activity specifically well-suited spreading COVID people gathering together restaurant people gathering together EAT?

Still waiting believable answer. know link shows deaths declining USA, right? I’m guessing churches think Jesus white. Lol wait tourists show up. Colorado can’t close borders, unfortunately. don’t think so, isn’t MIS-C thought subsequent consequence COVID opposed second infection? bunch mousekateers joining soon, least he'll plenty company. also encourage close eyes driving? Annoying turned yet another sub anti trump U.S politics

There's ""no politics"" rule sub, difficult talk avoidable disaster without critical mention person whose responsibility avoid it.

It's Trump, though. Jair Bolsonaro Boris Johnson deserve mention too. Minneapolis definitely following it. I've stand line, 90% people wear masks, etc. puts little ease worrisome mind mosques? Religion stupidity go hand hand lot people tired isolation church part social group.

Yeah well boo hoo. We're fucking tired isolation.

So many selfish assholes (not referring anyone talking about) shit like ruin rest us earnestly following restrictions several months now. You’re numbnuts.

Garrett available rematch? else equal, transmission probably slower summer compared would winter. However, decrease R0 necessarily mean goes 1 dies out. scientists anyone tiniest bit rationality saying 'maybe wait', churches said 'i know best, God save rightous actions'

whoops. good job, maybe next life useless idiot. makes want cry. kids believe parents want keep safe, indeed parents want do. parents want safe want protect her. Side homeless feces along tenderloin crime rate increasing, yeah sf beautiful. Christ’s sake, don’t give ideas I'm going experience. I'm exec non profit, applied received small PPP loan. amount allowed get based calculation payroll previous 12 months. employees $100k apply. 

We got one loans early original terms spend 75% payroll 25% expenses within 8 weeks getting loan. 8th week changed 60/40 24 weeks, basically spent money way payroll utilities building expenses 8 week period.

We received final paperwork SBA. show payroll records hours, rate, employee names pre covid time 8 week period loan. show copies receipts expenses incurred time period (so could instance pre-pay utilities). small organization ton paperwork. provided go loan forgiveness process hopefully forgiven grant. not, portions meet guidelines, amounts turn low interest loan. 

I spent literally days working bank board directors finance committee make sure applied for, receive correct amount used accordingly think better handle process. 

Point is, guidelines done money simply go company owner's pocket general fund use want. companies huge cash reserves get PPP loans, course. companies needed loans get them, absolutely. people people abusing system, know greatest extent rule allow. (For example, designed companies 500 less employees. Language added 500 less per location, huge company thousands employees spread multiple locations eligible). 

So yes, believe living stated above, rules going enforced least $ going large part back employees. So, “no” person asking evidence claims.

I remember projecting 1,600 deaths. projecting 17,000, Governor cowardly implement simple mask order. Yeah, kids sick passing on. Sorry say, value life corporate greed. Instead dumping 20% GDP prop stock market give money hedge funds, rather government true shut pay workers 60% wages Europe did. 

The Federal government’s response fucking appalling. handled like have, we’d like Europe Asia, small outbreaks. I'm worried about. love teaching I'm going twice. way could see working class lessons morning online classes afternoon. talks article. Pretty interesting stuff. Chicken pox cause hallucinations too. think hallucinations. Would pretty scary since second grade, though remember well. Chicken pox sucked United States corporations much power Church used back them. definitely force government hand coordinate train dog same... Take account access decent healthcare alrwady strained Black people. Okay already disadvantage there. 

Obesity 100% persons control. eating excess calories cause it, sorts reasons genetic issues mental issues cause person eat excessively lose weight. van see saying, like physically eat lot obese, theres thats always case, especially older already living poor lifestyles due POOR environment. essentially saying ""well choose take care themselves."" callous rhetoric people struggling many facets contribute rainbow problems. say dont care health dont even access proper healthcare underlines fact dont understand systemic oppression works. Easy upvotes shitting China. Lol. People need chill quarterbacking.

They never will. Everyone's epidemiologist knows better WHO. America like fat kid race happy didn’t get last place even though another kid twisted ankle. I've church times throughout this. Mandatory masks, every 2 every 3 pews empty, limited 50 people, must sign beforehand. virus spreaders! guy wonderful news, huge symbolic impact. world's focus US Brazil obvious reasons, news would give lot hope. Unfortunately, sometimes bad news attract views, seriously hope news gets worldwide coverage skeptical. would deserve people Bergamo deserve it, doctors nurses first hard hit hospital ""Western world"" deserve it, lot sick caught totally imprepared, heroic effort people Bergamo. tf going eat that? Hold breath... politicized nowadays. ""Eat rich"" catchy slogan. 

Usually mean people gotten wealth via theft. one uses phrase handwringing athlete got millions entirely via labor... earned means via exploitation marks-ist sense (not sure that's kosher word here) ""rich"". Vitale's message reads, part: “Are tired living dictatorship yet? happens people go crazy get tested. STOP GETTING TESTED!” 

I worry, Congressman, tests seem come go like wind. late wind ain't blowing many sections country. boot, results take 7-10 days, get reported big bad press. And, course, unless pro athlete, may nearly impossible get test without waiting line 12 hours (kinda like voting black) perhaps explains there's ton cases protests, moreso right businesses buildings opened again? reading ability give support, Navajo Nation's official covid relief fund: [http://www.nndoh.org/donate.html](http://www.nndoh.org/donate.html)

Bluff Area Mutual Aid also great work. mental health ramifications keeping kids home going disastrous I'm afraid. We're worried child's mental health can't go back, anyway. probably think death rate normal.

Like, country 300 million people, many people die per day? number probably big people really conceptualize. second wave crazy, 300 bed hospital spiked back 4 cases. rate we're going get overwhelmed... boredom. And? realize places US cases declining too? places aren’t even infections all?

Meanwhile new hotspots, death rates starting upwards despite couple weeks COVID deniers saying “oh well hospitalizations least death rate down”.

Jesus. many people die COVID deniers stop making excuses realize bad pretending/being optimistic isn’t helping? WTF going on?? Arizona implementing crisis triage, sending ""low score"" people die home without treatment, admin directing resources republican political convention? That's priority right now? People believe everything stems invisible sky magician don’t believe science respiratory diseases transmitted? Trump replaces Yesman. even larger disaster Also, people right wear masks, businesses also right let in.

Yet countless reports people yelling people enforcing masks inside businesses. don’t know people don’t want wear masks seem think ones freedom rights What's point? agree indoors dangerous not?

Public policies never going perfect, way COVID-19 spreads best change.

I'm guessing politikal axe grind. Shocked? ran PR team fell flat.

They thought better sure grey hairs future epicenter infection currently know villages date able blame 20 somethings taking responsibility actions. occupational risk calculated disease burden (total number fatalities/work days lost/lasting effects any) discovering infections change picture. someone falls stairway factory hits head dies put railing right even bunch people fell landed feet? she. like plague, people catch it, die, could see government administering vaccines force. probably effective thing government could would pass liability law held employers schools liable admitted employees students vaccinated (barring legitimate medical excuses). iger left right ish hit fan. minions scrambling clean mess point close *once*, effectively enough virus control local flareups dealt via Track Trace (whether that's done manual contact tracing, app, methods combination).

If can't close effectively, I'm sure there's much point second shut down... That's good thing, Mexico number#1 hot spot virus right now, still near deadly USA, top 10 countries. What’s wrong America lmao, Churches turning away actually wearing mask? understand masks optional, wear want don’t wear don’t want, would anyone ban masks? biochem living bombs westerners singing, sweet home Alabama. weather like Perth broke out? nice weather south US time, pretty well back then, Northern Europe hit harder American south beginning. weather got inhospitable Sun Belt, things really took off. North weather got pleasant, things really came off.


I can’t speak everywhere America, also get tested free time want. Democrats may largely control California, massively outnumber Republicans like northeast TON people California flouting guidelines comparison. say Republicans flouting rules, there's much overlap party people caring. Nobody actually dies COVID. old people dying causes. hospitals get money (probably Soros/Clinton/Gates) COVID deaths they're systematically forging death certificates nation-wide. Mask's mark final step removing rights living Marxist/Leninist society. Duh man. Probably safer windows shut. Particulate levels outdoor air much lower per OSHA/firefighter training much I’ve trained respiratory protection necessary outdoors ventilation. part protesters wearing masks outdoors paid well.

Outdoor air issue bunch people close without masks breeze/draft. particulates disperse better.

A couple virus particles get sick. Probably parents First all, please don’t criticize Christian. know people like that. thinking start going back church pandemic. learned follow Lord outside church now. Church kinda useless. money grabs. “Christians“ aren’t really Christians. lot don’t care lives others. get fucking deserve. lot COVID research released soon possible pre-print yet peer-reviewed, buddy. mentioned, isn’t source info - numerous studies point famotidine alone substantially reduce COVID mortality rates.

Peer reviewed famotidine know there’s done (as everything related Covid), enough studies this, antihistamines cheap well-tolerated, personally think it’s worth raising profile potential treatment.  thing back covid causing organ damage children? swear saw that. Tennessee - 7 days right now. least East TN death rates aren’t vs infected like said, vs positive tests (confirmed cases). CFR IFR. lose argument general credibility matter don’t know difference. IFRs generally agreed 0.2 0.6% CFRs anywhere 3-10% normally. Remember severe cases likely get test asymptomatic people. 
 
“On Thursday, World Health Organization held two-day online meeting 1,300 scientists around world, agency’s chief scientist, Dr. Soumya Swaminathan, said consensus I.F.R. 0.6 percent — means risk death less 1 COVID IFR using seroprevalence Wow, know christianity advocate death?

New York average temperature April pandemic peak - 13c/55f

Anchorage temperature today - 13c/55f making distinct decision one instance based years experience field education colleagues. It’s interesting politicians doctors asked opinions, anyone asking teachers classroom aides work kids? decision cannot made solely one group take consideration practicality starting schools midst pandemic. 

People idealized view education is, doesn’t match paper like ten years ago; like many facets society, education changing. covid donate plasma every 28 days science relating covid. wear mask whenever go science related covid. Sometimes science seems simple it’s life messy. It''s almost tax-free financial incentive open (5ind like every place champing bit reopen). niece loves peakaboo, she'll motions laugh say ""there is!"" he's not. may like virus, he'd agree open parks keep profits rolling in. he'd love fascist wannabe virus denier like Trump.

What would've made roll grave company run Jews. Since well known anti-semite. amazing people pull together something it. Well done Italy. Vogmasks available soon. They're coming new line ventilators, better option covid. masks pricey, they're washable last year. make different sizes also get band goes around back head help keep mask place.  Considering article explicitly states requiring masks situations social distancing possible..such stores Indoor areas I'm really sure point is.

But feel free walk around without pants bruh. Followed breathing oxygen dangerous. 100% death rate long run. It'd one thing rando, guy elected thousands people, heavily red district elected unopposed election, re-elected 45% margin victory

Idiocracy Yeah, that's Target. know blamed keep customers coming nothing. start ""no shirt, shoes, service"" policy they'll catch flak idiots lose business. say ""the government responsible, they're it"" appeal sides. Loose policy still tell everyone they're trying. USA doesn’t need enemy citizens. Right. Arguably longer transport would work virus it, eh? I'm sorry you. get hump we're still soluble country pack shit head north. really matter neighbors are.

The ex wife traveled country lot young everytime came quaint bohunk town she'd say... ooo move here.

""If *run asshole* morning, ran *asshole*. *run assholes* day, *the asshole*."" specifically had/have breathing anxiety, happening lockdown thought COVID month despite going anywhere. still wearing mask 8 hours job butt seat (we home, public sector worried ""optics"" anyone besides administrators working home). anxiety came back first, got used also tried couple co-worker made really nice, well thought-out mask. Good spent 3 months Peru last year, time last year Cusco sad see virus affecting country badly. 

Vamos el Peru! Un enorme abrazo para los Peruanos desde aqui. pants hiding gods creation wangers bits? Honestly fear God want good others . trust religious people even intent good . Pretty sure meant, “it’s common abbreviate PA” “it’s common know PA means physicians assistant” That’s normal Christian Pastor FYI. also avoid looking mirror ? People dying article says 650 cases. That's major source country well 3 million cases? I'm sure article written without bias, .0002% hardly qualifies ""major source"". It’s anthrax, you’re going open package get plume virus face.

Order package. interesting. article recently hypoactive delirium caused sedation, people commented happens time sedation necessarily related covid. wonder prevalence experiences like people COVID without fevers.  Rational people seeing others ""out about"" diminish rational decision join mass delusion things okay going back normal.

What's simplest explanation?

It's America giant amusement park party palace, way poor character citizenry. People want go party go restaurants get wasted friends yell ""wooooo!"" partying lake hundreds disgusting morons that's are. That's *we* are. 

The rest us fucked many types enough serious, rational, sober-minded people. Coming grips hardest part whole crisis... Realizing country full worst sorts people. can't leave. borders closed. Yep...

Sorry guys...blame government, totally call  Nature takes care itself. great news! Gives hope US though it’s long road ahead. know alex Jones wife? people saying is. I'm saying I've heard sources. pretty frequently. know many SARS survivors suffered greatly years recovered, right? long-term damage disability without virus staying dormant body. feel really, really worried character actors photo ops ride operators. I'm guessing general staff able wear masks, doubt Gaston, Cinderella, Tinkerbell allowed break character. Oh I'm aware

Just saying hear ""its cold"" time Australia, Denmark example.  evidence except young people permanent lung scarring? 25 year old healthy woman literally needed lung transplant covid obliterated lungs?

You cant look permanent lung scarring incidents think wont health issue people future I'm sort curious guy thinks condoms. Yes account 4/5 week lag time southern states re-opened compared simultaneous massive rise cases/positivity rate? considering activities happening along. live really dense part LA straight lockdown whole time.. i'd say 80% people outside wearing masks, apartment community even enforcing mask use common areas, including elevators. mask vendors front Ralphs (grocery store). Even homeless wearing masks.

All this, city still struggling contain outbreak suburbs orange county many ignorant freedom-addled fucks ruining rest us. USA USA USA /s Yeah they’ll make employees sign waivers don’t get vaccine. Easy peasy consequences business owners forcing employees work least NBA it’s optional players, single site, daily testing won’t crowds. No, can't. even try pretend parents working home alternate care assure not. Bleep! ALERT! Discovery! Abort! It’s law wear seatbelts vehicle. can’t smoke indoors places due second hand smoke... mandating masks public places pandemic shouldn’t different? 

Sometimes people adapt things safety well others... baffles difficult people understand. idea school going start successful epically stupid. I'm saying protests tens thousands deep - sanctioned government - even though they're outside, sheer size obviously makes dangerous 50 100 person church service abiding rules. completely depends jurisdiction laws jurisdiction. law requiring people cover genitalia absolutely unconstitutional. Again, well litigated. 

Quick edit: Supreme Court dealt 10th Circuit's gender discrimination public nudity laws issue yet, requiring men cover would invalid states 10th Circuit, subject challenge everywhere. prefer term covenger that's utterly despicable first tell people go fuck themselves. China, however, earned fair share criticism actions outbreak provided links several articles detailing attempts hide severity downplay significance. that's without getting massive human rights violations. 100,000 run rate month end. Yeah really throwing too... Like get church rhetoric friendly towards Covid-precautions, 650 cases.. 130,000+? feel numbers make reaching, non-story. Let’s open schools! Surgical masks little wire things built in. clothes ones really sew foam moldings something too.

Makes way effective well comfortable. China force American government drop ball. offspring choice option. say wearing regardless boo better data ill gladly update estimate solution small day cares absolutely need it. kids school probably find alternate care 100% agree take one step further. religious people, regardless religion, demonstrate inability think critically part agenda. Never mind fact one fundamental tenets protestantism need intermediary commune God. literally one important things schism Catholic Church Protestant church. forget 5.5 billion people world hundreds countries vested American politics agreed too! Wednesday even yet Killing patrons, terrible business plan reality would worked like US? 


Even without current federal government lying would still people society insisting 5g giving covid - would still virulent anti-intellectual / anti-science / anti-facts / pro-whatever fox/AM news says. Even super progressive federal response would governor's/legislatures like desantis Florida opened way soon ignored scientists. 


I little faith US system would react correctly almost crisis let alone public health crisis. Italy applauded difficult compare response own. Ish. agree correlation however don’t know factor people deal Cells, compared Antibodies. reports suggesting every infected person produces antibodies, 2/3 fight using Cells never produce antibodies. 

This would explain phenomena New York London virus almost disappeared despite opening quite ago. Remember said Obamacare would let Grandma die? seeing America Trump administration. heard mayor saying person many years live less likely make it, sending home! Totally unexceptable. suffering feel like drowning. happening countries pandemic first started. Never dreamed would see happen here. Went one Best Buy required masks.

Went across town Best Buy require masks. 

Non-compliance across da board. sub’s fucking joke reason, many others. biggest one, highlighting hypocrisy that’s run rampant here. Fucking travesty forum zero god, 100% showing support Fox News line Knew could find one wild lol. “half dozen” posts garbage. There’s way protesting somehow safer going church gym grocery store comes transmission. suspension logic necessary believe absurd. mine set start year and... no. obvious things done meant get people sick. Hello, New York would like also sign letter. testing rise exponential, rise cases been. pretty apparent latest spike actual cases. might learn we're much better treating disease thought... problem. Sorry grandpa. Except kids school eat skittle bowl. every time someone picks skittle NEAR cyanide one, another cyanide one added. Free markets capitalism fix it!

/s obvi Sikhs underrated comes religions go way help others, even people outside religion. u mean 9000? actually handful kids grade aren’t Catholic—they don’t participate religious aspects. aren’t good public schools area lot private ones require battling I-95 traffic get there. parents offered pay it, encourage kids choose feel comfortable with. bite tongue avoid reverse Karen there, again, public schools issues too. 
Anywho, incredibly outrageous took money—and took tuition money boot! points public health perspective people wearing masks indoors time. Even alone even masks less effective stopping smaller droplets. Guys wear underwear. long private parts showing, fine Well nudity would longer imply consent, can't control themselves...and pudenda would acknowledged 'god' humanity, misogynistic, genocidal, sky buddy. schools guys keep talking AC sound terrifying miserably hot. Thanks correction.

HR person brain damaged. *We can't stop, slow first....* Serious question - people sure exposure party? clearly reckless (as church gatherings), feel like I’m missing something. parents work medicine, possible gave supposed preventive medicine wanted go regardless would regular risk? fear crying “covid party” without solid evidence makes people look like they’re crying wolf less credible future. funny. dint get predicting September far case/death rates? small kids retired April (teacher). district (philly) said yesterday kids return &amp; desks 6 ft apart.

I'm hesitant get first round vaccines, feel rushed, knows political financial agenda behind it. However, first run goes well, means, I'll vaccination shot. Go screw. Mmmm could actually higher number deaths. MA. husband got next-day results, upcoming medical procedure test might prioritized. Heh. Awesome! People like movies perfect seats good people. actors appreciate dedication craft. I'll hunt you, too. really problem folks take proactive response? Personally feel would done far better people actually got information bubble contributing reducing spread instead screaming:""My freedumb steak!!!!"" [sic]
 
 may know lot history one thing sure learn it.

 knew going happen personal observations beginning family listen. starting pay attention.

It's late opinion though. patients shoppin' curiosity checked obits section small town Ohio newspaper grew up, area voted 75% Trump.
June 1 August 8:

2016 101 deaths

2017 99

1018 107

2019 105

2020 122.


Total reported Covid 19 related deaths two counties served paper (Mercer Auglaize) since June 1: 0.

It seems statistically unlikely feeling kind thing going over. *Sikhism Service* 

The Sikh belief service others crucial component religion. Sikh faith acknowledges beings one, living harmony crucial piece living peace.

Seva means “selfless service,” meaning service done thought one’s personal gain. Sikhs believe charity given attempt curry favor God; instead given pure desire help others, act brings one closer God.

Guru Nanak taught beings divinity within them; thus, helping one another helping God. though fear God even lot several people!*** wonder it’s due drinking urine state? need re-read thread. 
Dude says deaths increasing USA. 
I post facts show aren’t. 
You post facts aren’t. 

Do understand logic flow here? Someone must taken mask statue history forgotten. Governor said Texas police enforce mask laws probably show all. God dead -- Nietzsche 
So fans -- COVID-19  Say me. You. Can't. Have. A. Healthy. Economy. Without. A. Healthy. Population. 

People refusing fly locked not. virus running rampant country majority people longer feel safe.

If would effective lockdown, could minimized pain. no, long haul.  mAsKs sLaVeRy!

/s Many localities United States anti-nudity laws repeatedly upheld US Supreme Court. There's nuance cases, exceptions certain 1st Amendment activities, walking public sidewalk genitalia feel like putting pants going fly places laws. they've struck down, aside 1A concerns, unequally applied (for example, requiring women wear shirts, men, became issue 10th Circuit). Yes still effective; masks electrostatic charges affected water/sweat electrostatic layer gets wet. infuriating thing. solution simple takes compliance/ lack anti mask propaganda campaigns Praise Satan! 🤘🖤 doesn’t new normal. It’s “the new normal” absolute idiotic murderous thugs office millions retarded rednecks refusing follow directives packing indoor bars, churches, facilities completely free culpability kind “brave,” correct? Remember, coronavirus spreads restaurants, bars, public parks, churches. doesn’t spread protests, hardware grocery stores.  That's Obama wants think!!

Just kidding.

 realize see would deter creating multiple accounts. Hamilton issued mask orders well He’s anti-BLM statement away filling Trump bingo card. Cheers that. Unfortunately sort new (it's 2 years) ""luxury"" tracking idiot neighbors Facebook. probably best nosey old people I'm thirty-something. like idea I'll see do. Stay safe *and* that's great, safely. every church protest rally (lmao) correctly, ones incorrectly. personally try avoid buildings general large groups avoidable that's me. feel safe follow reasonable restrictions, means. Even so, presence HVAC system mean virus particles stay airborne long possible. church starting get services back together limited numbers every week. I’m impressed much keep social distancing going. masks actually recommended use. US Headline: 47,991 days first Covid-19 patient, first hospital USA admit Covid patient reports Zero COVID patients ICU!

This 131 years future. wish Oh, 100% agreed. Trudeau good. real MVP Singh, who's directly pushing Trudeau pretty much put people first terms virus worry economic impact later. 

We idea back October critical Minority government would terms response COVID-19 regards overall well-being Canadians. people become complacent electing people again. think that’s general consensus province. watched heart grow 2 sizes March 12th one biggest differences education still take place without school (even it’s less ideal), getting groceries cannot function without stores (even delivery someone physically going store you). grocery store cashier, you’re also going behind plexiglass barrier, touching people, maintain distance teacher. school, think even basic day day things. kid question worksheet - refuse go near look work? isn’t accounting behavior problems teachers deal every day - listening directions/defiance, teasing/touching kids, actual big problems like fights. think kid going wear mask day stay distant others, imagine teacher trying get kids walk straight line go music. Imagine telling 5 year olds can’t hug others. No, working grocery store ideal this, teacher ideal. 883 childcare centers....that's less 2 center. stated scenario 150 1 school. Aint school bih.. lol fun read I'm going drink much vaccine! Numbers tend higher Tuesdays wednesdays weekend backlogs, even apparent holiday weekends sure wish people would finally wake realize religion made scam. get every Tuesday, Wednesday, Sunday make sure wallet! Jesus doesn’t like don’t give Two weeks! RemindMe! 14 days stupidity runs guy like tsunami. Many people change stance becomes personal - brother, aunt, father, etc dies COVID.

Unfortunately many persons particular political view point stance “it happened won’t happen me”.

Mostly people strut around bragging strong immune systems. Black Bike Week moved September? I'm guess move one... Results 5 days

That way long, makes contact tracing useless. I'm Ontario got result 36 hours. aw man that's fun

Well done! I'm concerned people recovered react normal flu. sound peoples bodies pretty screwed would hypothetically increase risk ending hospital dying flu. Hurricanes force/act nature (most) people take seriously. virus honestly different core, people underestimate it? family friend that's neurosurgeon rotates ER month. Back March, called us told us experienced diagnosed first COVID-19 patient; extremely alarmed fast patient went downhill. Could please ask knowing get ER time treatment, family member end C-19? need device home tests oxygen saturation? doctor friend alarmed offered grocery shop us keep us safely home since PPE concerned time. Miami-Dade County Public Schools won’t able reopen schools, new state order calls for, county still Phase 1 reopening stage, county leaders tightening due surge COVID-19 cases, Miami-Dade Schools Superintendent Alberto Carvalho said Tuesday.   conditions continue upward trajectory — Florida’s confirmed COVID-19 cases doubled past two weeks 213,000 — Carvalho said interview Herald foresee MDCPS “being able resume schooling traditional way.”   county still Phase 1 start school Aug. 24, now, schooling would held entirely online. want timeline every state followed guidelines instead speeding open. vile human being. exceed federal health guidelines reopening.

Are Federal guidelines, states own? I've pretty confused current President's Administration. Recorded deaths. US one handful countries semi-accurately (of course undercounts classifying pneumonia) report deaths little prevent them. plenty countries without infrastructure get accurate information. ""Most guidelines suggest changing surgical mask time becomes wet. mask wet exhaled moisture increased resistance airflow, less efficient filtering bacteria, vents more.8 It’s uncommon, though, says Dianne Rawson, RN, MA, Basics Surgical Mask Selection, see masks poorly fitted, placed nose, wet blood body fluids.9""  
  
Seem good surgical masks. much available cloth logic would seem hold would increased resistance filtering. moisture would prevent breathing fibers. number tell going world? south American, USA churches feel weird.

Definitely Thank much! think smaller consequences pandemic also quite often interesting. better hope decline saying shit tube shortly. guess every religion multiple shoots.

Definitely. Abrahamic religions branches Judaism, Christianity Islam, branch like Christianity Catholic, Orthodox Protestant. Similarly Hinduism, Buddhism Jainism sharing similarities, branch schools like Hinduism Vaishnavism, Shaivism, Shaktism, Smartism. syncretism creating interesting believes like shinbutsu-shugo afro-american religions.

It's really pity many people nowadays ""allergic"" religion whole, fascinating subject one could easily spend several lifetimes studying. already cover 1918? wish atheists less militant views. Like want religious people respect lack belief find many disrespectful people faith. 

Can’t everyone believe want believe move lives?

Sure criticize leadership religions don’t put followers. I’m religious us vs. mentality isn’t productive anyone

Edit: course recognize irony criticizing atheists entire group like act same. whenever see someone identify atheist online it’s always followed generalizations shut possible conversation I’m challenging response I’m sincerely curious. data available corroborate that? Anything realm many people long term effects long term effects impact people different ages differently?

I’m wary hearing isolated incidents applying across population, first good stat would % people end long term effects.

Again understand may answer data unavailable sparse curious. city, firefighters trained assist paramedics, usually first ones arrive. Texas' Florida's mask mandates specifically exclude churches? Just...WTF? even mask mandate point? exactly opposite views stances. people government, bosses, masters, Ines bearing find them, failed time, time, time again. see it, rest should, forcing sees evil, exact reason need. 
The people lands pay them, government, can't let rats decide life choices, yet are. want change this, some( maybe you) comfortable told how, why. Fuck fuck them. laid dues, much more. I'd like run Fucking colors see stands.

I don’t like conflation immunity antibody levels generally, aren’t thing don’t know many immune. schools forcing open September. Weather certainly helped, warm long days then, got colder prepped.

But nothing larger impact messaging. Again, told Feb 27 pandemic inevitable. US administration was, meanwhile, sharing [this via Twitter late Mar 10. said, world's apart.

Hence world [was toilet paper panics, back days US Senators still selling stocks. early days, literal one chance get stopping pandemic tracks. trying get everyone mutates become less deadly ::taps head:: guess I'm ranting point, alone. 

Thank you, sorry feel though must go there, get it. employer also stated group call that, 25 cases facility work (there employees *have* come work warehouse) case since mid June. employer also feels biggest risk people contract COVID daily lives, work. live mad world. personal positivity rate decline however.

Wouldn’t enough time kill virus it? almost like teachers schools much important place economy get credit paid for. remember going peak 60k total whole country? Looks like intelligent person America Bill Gates. one listening him. I’m arguing guys good job controlling, much better us NY.

I've approved this. There's nothing big small discussed. whatever users find interesting long factual related coronavirus. Pretty sure giving people it, testing it.

If testing fucking important, would 15 minute test..what crock shite we're led believe.  Nothing really done drastically flatten curve. Places still open, people don’t want wear masks, law enforcement aren’t enforcing mask wearing places outbreak bad, federal government pushing schools re-open fall. think August bad?

Depending pull stats from, Texas somewhere range og 2,700 (Google dashboard) 2,800 (Worldometer) official Covid-19 deaths.

Also, think international students pay tuition, assistantships open everyone equally, US citizens greencard holders first. Wtf get angry little comment. encourage kids speak like do?

I doubt every parent feels Until? even states relatively minimal almost non existent number cases deaths? Cus so, that’s unreasonable. mean won? statement simply show foolishness blanket statements regarding churches. claim churches ever held society back absurd.

Well...here are. Part can't believe I'm living this. Good! Desantis bright. Thursday, historically highest number week, gonna scary honestly understand point. Poverty already huge problem considering richest country world, that’s inexcusable. dramatically exasperated issues.

That said, still iceberg situation. pretty certain thinking begun; scary February numbers completely numbed us now. nonchalance rising numbers naivety core. Sheer ignorance.

Even CFR 0.4 0.6%, potentially massive health implications besides death. Things mire victims poverty even temple halted economy would. glassed lungs potential cardiovascular issues, medical bills falling ass perpetuity. Insurmountable, many medical billing issues become due disastrous insurance/healthcare scheme. 

And finalize point Iceberg: numbers continue rise. Early estimates 60-80% total population infection. vitality nearly unprecedented considering CFR low enough promote continued survival virus. tens, maybe hundreds millions infections. 500,000k deaths CFR estimation, combined month-long ICU stays many that, even permanent, sometimes invisible potentially irreversible damage? 

We shut another months, god forbid stupid use personal mitigation tactics, save lives. It’s responsible leader would do.

Also, things world truly 100% risk death, valid point all. clear point can't count people right thing? laws ordinances exist specifically (some) people wrong thing must compelled right thing? governor state legislatures power compel people right thing + save lives, reason REFUSE so, subsequently blame people govern? don’t see large offices generally viable there’s vaccine. They’re much better bars restaurants one case could knock entire office/company. It’s crazy risk take don’t absolutely need to. That's pretty high working age population. Meatpacking one higher occupational risks normal times, still 151 workers died occupational accidents entire period [2004 - Covid essentially multiplied occupational risk one dangerous jobs factor 4.5. Likewise, many NYPD officers died covid number police officers killed gunfire entire country 2019. We’re track 100,000 day shortly. Hope I’m wrong. 

My dumbass thought wouldn’t hit 50,000 till week 4th. wishful thinking.. 4th July happened think meant 29 hours job, employers provide benefits full time employee would get. less economy, whether lockdown sustainable solution.

It's shown concerns correct. Many countries/US states strict lockdowns still partially locked playing whack-a-mole cases.

The countries completely eradicated - like NZ - hermetically sealed rest world vaccine.

Meanwhile, nation state lock single digit deaths returned normal.

Surprised question there's never worldwide lockdown human history... Restrictions irrelevant population abide them. I'm going claim that. I'm going ask good source shows protests spread covid. Next I'm going say looters spread protestors. “All’s best best possible worlds...” Monmouth county. Asbury/Middletown. outside. single person. Asbury boardwalk 0 masks. Inside maybe different. Looks like new VA plan deal patient wait times.

I support troops wearing mask voting Biden post link study, linked page pure cancer Meh. learned reddit way fun stop looking votes. Hopefully wake call Florida get competence road..

So, saying,is people people trained medical health accountable people protect,need shut wear mask safety community?

So cut off? *Only First-World Nation Fails Contain COVID-19 Withdraws World Health Organization* 

What rock living under? US still far behind countries terms deaths per capita. countries (Sweden comes mind) Europe taken approach US.

Also, organization said wearing masks help general population, organization said closing borders limiting air travel anything, organization said asymptomatic spread happen, organization took two months evidence H2H transmission possible finally say it, organization said months little risk countries went back edited documents say said severe risk.

Clearly neither good epidemiological point view fuck churches still open... spray virus pray away? March 4th, Perth city outtested NYC. per capita, total.

But Feb 27 told pandemic inevitable, vs Mar 10 US still fed absurd propaganda all.

We mask mandate. also community transmission since April, currently tossing whether allow 60k people stadium football game later month not.

Last checked, still testing similar levels US per capita. Anyone slightest sore throat get tested free. find many positive cases, *in hotel quarantine* entering state must stay 14 days let public.

It's different world, vs ours. work plant rural (read: conservative) area starting see upyick cases. office area plexiglass set adjacent desks, nothing front back. half-hearted reminders put mask desk come weekly. reminders wear mask nose well come every weeks. guys floor rarely wear misting fans every production line keep people comfortable. see blowing droplets everywhere. plant manager refuses conference calls insists floor reviews discuss issues could handled via email.

I guess I'm ranting point, alone. can’t even imagine Moab like right now. LOL get load guy talking ""what Jesus taught."" Pffft. flattening curve maxed testing per day. 

Unless sent medical professionals, states won’t increased positive totals instead increased positive percentages. even peer reviewed drug combination exhibited reductions symptom progression compared published reports COVID-19 patients.

So bother actual control group, great. Man SF beautiful, great city

Now ya'll address housing crisis lol see read article. many times keep repeating ""I told so."" beyond ridiculous. exhausting bad leadership country. good legal reason that. churches, gyms bars might equally good spreading virus churches tons legal protections gyms bars not. burden proof regulation involving churches going high the. state municipality entitled err side caution. 

And good reason difference law. Widespread underground bars create gambling, prostitution, drugs lots extramarital sex. Widespread underground gyms create snobby sports lots gay sex. Widespread underground churches create widespread political extremism least undermines ability dominant groups society continue governing worst leads full fledged societal replacement. 

Church leadership must onboard Covid response. Bar leadership's opinion matter much. Actually you’re idiot

Here facts msm won’t tell you:

Florida: director infection prevention UF Health Jacksonville, Chad Neilsen, told News4Jax level occupation ICUs uncommon.” maybe stop listening CNBC cnn hunting clicks keep seeing movie theaters ranks worse schools. 

I'm struggling understand one. 

Modern movie theaters seats least little spaced out. also big room high ceiling. couple hours. 

Schools hand small rooms butt ass tight full humans. school day lasts way longer movie. ....are....are joking? Memes hand washing?? People washing fucking hands?? I’m church goer, neither family, I’m atheist. 

But I’ll say family religious rely church hope, friendship. know poo poo church lot line, warranted, it’s cruel mock others truly believe (if hard others). 

I say qualifier shouldn’t meeting churches right now, churches divide people, rather help community, worth salt. Many Christians (and religions) good things try help unfortunately. Jains come mind well. nobody meeting person right now, essential people find meaning lives. co-exist me. 

That’s all. 2 cents. Man that's pretty great infographic. Well yes that's entirely rational. Gathering gathering, matter purpose. I'm sure did. probably survive long afterwards though. Italians it! pulled scientists China? decided people would know good idea?

Waste air 2,000 patients seen ER today COVID symptoms give idea going. Testing seems hit ceiling last week. daughter's first birthday coming next month. parents want see big day (which get, first grandbaby). seen months part staying home, working home going essentials. 

I told parents determined see daughter, need quarantine home 14 days coming over. dad said Bernie telling do? fucking virus, political, fucks sake. agreed terms said, ""you know church essential me."" use think dad smart guy growing up, he's fucking MAGA moron, disappointing. Aerosol usually exists relatively sealed/closed door environment, thinking patient's room elevator.

And virus spread way needs reach certain level density/quantity.

So yes easy transmit open air stays hours. news mean say, Leadership skills political party related, good leader good leader regardless political party. evident lack caring anyone governor Florida shown. party, one lives narcissist fantasy, reality people.

In Europe, lockdown associated *downward* trend daily cases. look lockdown period, week cases stop rising, trend toward zero next couple months.  It’s climbing India eased lockdown,

In India, climbing *faster* eased lockdown, never stopped climbing. lockdown prevented India ramping Jan Feb

That untrue. India impose lockdown March 24, grand total 536 cases. Lockdown prevent anything started. likely reason Jan Feb appear low India testing. Well take 4 days results come SARS disease much severe. doubt numbers Covid19 nowhere near severe World Health Organization (WHO), total 8,098 people worldwide became sick SARS 2003 outbreak. these, 774 died.

Bingo. could written thing like that: ""GEttINg hEAvEN PRetTY EssENTIal!"" so, people say themself, hey, immitation Donald Trump, so, likely sarcasm. Again, wrong. keep thinking herd immunity something *herd* has. that's false complete misunderstanding meaning term. Herd immunity something herd GIVES vulnerable individuals. 

herd immunty single vulnerable individual sea people, result whether people able contagiously spread virus. immunity whole population has. 

The difference chicken pox HIV stay contagious HIV. chicken pox STOP contagious initial symptoms clear sufficiently. 

Your last sentence especially shows mis-using concept really understand definition term fighting about. no, HIV work chicken pox does, **Herd immunity saying ""we immune"" saying ""we contagious YOU, single vulnerable person surrounded herd, functionally immune.**

Chicken pox works way - catch kids clear initial symptoms, dropped sea adults chicken pox kids exposed contagious adult. work HIV, infected folks stay contagious. work chicken pox. matter virus still body - matters capable becoming contagious again.

[Here wikipedia article Herd read actually learn word is. case lazy stubborn, first sentence:

 - Herd immunity (also called herd effect, community immunity, population immunity, social immunity) form indirect protection infectious disease occurs large percentage population become immune infection, whether vaccination **or previous infections, thereby providing measure protection *for individuals immune*.**

""we"" get herd immunity. CONFER herd immunty upon individual herd protecting exposure contagious individual. That’s unfortunate. Say louder ding dongs back! Population density. New Jersey populated state density, whereas [Texas spreading quick = Hospitals overrun = fatalities. 25% positive tests alarming.

Nice see action God thinks so-called followers. bad bring virus home sane people. Choice? choice? mean decision made complete disregard educators. Hydroxychloroquin whatever isnt prescribed drug? feel like be... HVAAAAAAAC See, virus really care we're tired it. Back normal, folks! article linked addressed COVID different virus flu. 

Have nice day. 1. look case count. number cases largely determined many tests state conducted day. 

2. Positivity rate hospitalizion rate key indicator trends..both increasing terrible news. exponential growth shines, unfortunately. get 1% population infected, 5 weeks get 4%, 10 weeks get 16%. week 5 hospitals full already. 1% country.

Please don’t take seriously thought too, guarantee anti-mask folks escalate further.

Everything becoming warzone it’s exhausting. I'm sorry, say it. Religion softens brain. 

Goddamn stupid people. didn’t want done fucking disgrace. also humanitarian disaster.  Maybe realize people quarantined Bible. know, who'd thought? even wear masks themselves. I'm vendor servicing popular yellow dollar store two stores 24 employees wearing masks correctly. atheist come innate values definition. literally means believe existence god/gods, thus live life belief gods' existences influencing decisions.

That people defensive. Lmaooo one slamming table So, isn’t remotely informative unless test 100% population? percentage per million figure means nothing. actual number higher sure. There’s evidence u.s. higher average death rate. reason u.s. struggling lot infections. anything death rate relatively low, steadily declining Ah yes mean hot spot everyone protested already basically infected showing 0 symptoms like majority young people do? Okay

Way cherry pick city went faux “herd immunity” whereas literally every place surge It’s pretty clear church wrong here. know Republicans could looked like 'heroes'? actually taking steps mitigate pandemic. making decisions lead things getting better, worse. actually caring public letting science drive response, emotion. Fuck delusional, self-righteous politicians. died tomorrow peasants would rejoice. Jeez that's nuts. church opened encouraged anyone children elderly family members remain home. run 25% capacity require distancing. study groups nursery. even really agree opening all, attend, watch Facebook. least trying. Word attending member tests positive shut services.   Well guess trump defund them? Pikachu surprise face Well, exactly saying much, pretty much everywhere world did, including countries literally told citizens drink vodka go hug eachother Saunas.

As Canada, aside literally murdering lot long term home residents slow weak response, rest ok. FINALLY mandated masks Ontario couple places (only 4 months late) numbers ok.

But government *did* fuck lot things taking seriously beginning, boy, old folks homes suffer.

At least served expose rot system - People paying $6,000 month care literally *dying starvation* Covid, people paid feed just.. wouldn't. Hiding hospital data too. Florida gonna Florida. Eventually daily covid deaths surpass daily abortions 125,000 day, Christian's able make comparison anymore. reports coming morning previous days testing. current day. retains zero information them. incredible unable learn anything JR is. That's surprising considering piece shit John Menard is. that's always think twice considering anything Bolsonaro voter says... he's saying shit like 20 years everyone voted knew it. literally can’t. Lol benefit us hurt US?  thought would hate working home.

And idea testing it. Shortages swabs reagents completely unrelated vaccine safety.  I'm Christian Christians hold Jesus ultimate sacrifice, animal sacrifices longer needed. goes anything old testament - see enough things criticize Christians regarding new testament alone.  always mixed results, would work side effects really bad. Turns tachycardia explains why. still take 100mg really focused particular reason, mostly driving.

With stretch, imagine conclusion wanted reach ""Stalin CCP atheist, therefore atheists garbage"" bad faith argument reason ""Megachurches crazy methhead churches garbage, therefore churches garbage"" bad faith argument. 

No not, megachurches following ideology based religion. people going there, feel compelled religion. one may agree with, following it, similar extent others. Everyone picks chooses.

The 2 examples though, actions completely decoupled atheism. part believing god says kill millions criteria morality declare Atheist / Christian / Morman / Muslim / etc.,

In universe think religions described dont dictate criteria morality followers?! state guidelines morality followers many function fundamental moral guiding member group completely separate question whether person moral.

This doesnt even lead first half sentence. completely disconnected ideas.

Also, religion tells scare young children saying dont follow words old compilation book forever burn hell, id say that'd point moral person.

Now personally think understanding ought considering people often indoctrinated young ages, arent necessarily cruel purpose means immoral thing without malice. think fair say every country world handling better US true,. said international shipping huge mess.. expect possible long delays transport customs. (may vary country.. know USPS hurting bad front) likely catch local postal carrier whoever shipped it.

such goodboi. need little bit less religion... natural selection finest! Trusting tories 😆😆😆 think Iran's case worth looking (just see worldometer trends). find cases peaked April start, went way till second week May, surge till mid June, almost plateaued constant infection rate (which higher compared pre-April levels).

You find deaths followed lag 2 3 weeks. is, cases rising month June, death toll pick up; daily deaths picked up, fact higher highest death happened mid-April.

That's deaths lag. US, now, early August, daily deaths locations would soaring high. Even infections occurring mainly ""less vulnerable"" population, high numbers, absolute number deaths high. And, forget rampant obesity rates US, makes population general susceptible developing complications virus.

# Coronavirus surge jeopardizes reopening K-12 schools, L.A. County's top health official warns

By Howard BlumeStaff Writer 6-8 minutes   

The pending reopening K-12 campuses suddenly risk [ongoing coronavirus cases, public private schools must prepare students continue learning entirely home, Los Angeles County’s top public health official told local education leaders. 

This sobering message delivered Tuesday county Public Health Director Barbara Ferrer, termed “off record” phone call district superintendents others intended media public. Times obtained recording call.

“Every single school district point needs plans place continue distance learning 100% time,” Ferrer said told officials public private schools. “We would irresponsible didn’t say back-up plan ready.”

Ferrer also said remained hopeful campuses could reopen anticipated said administrators continue develop plans well. 80 school districts L.A. County serving 1.5 million children. even campuses cannot reopen start school year, delay might weeks rather longer period.

“I think it’s completely appropriate move forward plans anticipated — hoping would opportunity allow children teachers staff get back buildings, really enriched educational experience everyone desperate for,” said. “That also huge implications working parents.”

All same, “it would foolish, given numbers are, school districts \[distance learning\] plan back pocket,” said.

The county planning release detailed guidelines reopening campuses week. include requiring teachers students older 2 wear face coverings virtually times. rare exceptions students risk serious medical consequence. cases, however, others contact student would required wear medical-grade protective face covering.

Students also must six feet apart classes. spaces impossible, alternate plan would set partitions desks.

The debate reopen schools amplified week [President Trump, said campuses students five days week. Nothing like seriously considered students California, school systems working hybrid schedules, students would campus part-time small groups, working rest time home, online offline.

A coalition teachers unions education organizations quickly responded Trump, saying reopening remains goal, effort guided scientific medical recommendations additional federal aid needed schools manage increased costs. school systems already received substantial portion federal coronavirus-related funding approved earlier year, larger aid package currently stalled Congress.

The Trump administration also pressured colleges universities return normal schedule. addition, administration announced week [non-citizen students could country coursework delivered online-only format. Many universities, including UC system, large enrollment international students.

Trump’s back-to-campus argument based importance restarting economy allowing parents return work also benefiting students, many suffered distance learning. health risks, said administration, adequately managed.

There broad agreement among experts near-worldwide school shutdown harmed students academically psychologically. [Schools countries there’s debate conclusions draw examples.

Key Florida state officials sided president, threatening withhold funding school systems don’t reopen. Arizona, led Republican governor Trump ally, could comply substantially president’s exhortations fall, recently [closed state campuses Aug. Hospitals parts state [at risk coronavirus patients. 

Ferrer told school leaders said concerned similar situation could evolve locally, would ultimately influence whether would sensible reopen schools.

“We’re realistic much county afford another million people much community transmission right now,” Ferrer said.

She added [did expect outlook improve next two weeks recent widespread noncompliance health directives social distancing wearing face coverings. still time reverse negative trends start school year. 

L.A. Unified scheduled begin academic year Aug. 18. Supt. Austin Beutner said Monday district made decision whether district offer hybrid schedule whether classes remain exclusively online. He’s said key factor could whether state local officials could take charge necessary testing coronavirus contract tracing. 

Ferrer offered limited encouragement front Tuesday, saying sheer number schools made impossible county take lead. 

“It’s highly likely school settings course next year, experience positive case,” Ferrer said. “We source support, there’s thousands school buildings L.A. County, we’re really going rely heavily every school district good plans place.”

She also said would practical effective launch widespread, school-based testing program time.

“Certainly three cases building ... you’re required law notify us, we’ll part active investigation,” Ferrer said. respectfully cut funding.  Welcome long term Zoom hell kids. expect less Nanaimo 😂 impression Trump Pence expecting social-distancing guidelines enforced. seem want schools run business usual like old normal, MAGA rallies. He's cited several countries EU reopened schools successfully. However, fails mention countries outbreaks control! not. fall going biggest shitshow far. can't help wonder sales pitch try get parents keep kids enrolled private schools next school year, given decent probability local/regional closures future. (From hear, distance learning mostly failure regardless whether schools public private, throwing thousands dollars private school get bad instruction seems ludicrous.) Unfortunstely, (at least states) need state license this. really limits job prospects. Everyone program jobless 7 months now. I'm church administrative assistant working home since March. attend different church also person services. interesting see churches opened soon possible ones stuck online plan. 

While miss seeing church people person, I'm interacting online would typically person. Places exact type things back 1918. Even parade.

We learn history. live across street church. limiting attendance, blocking every pew, enforcing mask (and mask mandate state). 

Not every church blatantly ignoring virus marquee toxicity kills body well mind! im part auto industry-detroit area word retarded? Florida reopening schools August silver lining. There'll 4-5 weeks Florida opens schools school systems reopen enough time start getting results. there's major spike Florida cases, systems slow reopening response. Sucks Florida personal opinion, fact. take lot effort figure cause effect pandemic. instance, look \[new cases started dropping days lockdown order came. Considering incubation time 2-14 days (median 5) might take couple days people seek medical attention, could argue spread virus seems stopped week government reacted 13 March. Given sluggishness spread disease think connection lockdown measures Denmark drop new cases clear. Perhaps I'm wrong certainly looks possible.

I \[heard doctors need least three weeks know certain measure effect pandemic governments piled multiple measures time (which understandable) hard claim know measure cause effect. Unsurprisingly, people misinterpreting headline ignoring conditions study. Plenty commenters noticed this, but...alarmism wins guess. 

Anyway, here's brief comment adds  force things open mean people show up, teachers, students, admin, maintenance..goodluck.

See airlines reference. Texas death rate also likely climb soon back testing serious cases (at least city) voices profits-over-people heard. would take strong boycott Disney properties merchandise. would affect share-holders negatively enough force public responsibility forced. It’s high time saw Disney exposed company completely unconcerned children families beyond consumer worth. mean logic family members friends get it, shouldn’t go hospital it’s time go. Right? Don’t clog hospitals you’re willing stupid &amp; careless. made point. call racist! Dude same. graduated December. I’ve applied 400 jobs since then. one — mean one — hiring. 3 open school counselor jobs entire state. cry everyday. Lol guess mentality, it, need protect himself. I'm happy hear that! remember beginning outbreak seeing hearing horror stories Italy. vaccine available election day (it be) initial batch 100 million doses year end. 

That's enought planet +/- 4 Billion people. doses shared among countries, get? 20 million we're lucky. 20 million population 320 million!

A vaccine going panacea think will! protect yourself. problem is, ""noble losers"" rarely get statues. tried, end, failed. I'm saying failure head, I'm saying anyone could done better, face response entirely ineffective. Perhaps parents wanted recognized God fearing life savers presumed got infected, would cure daughter hailed healers. knows? maybe assumed God wouldn’t let Co vid church. realized it, arrogantly decided knew best probably made recovery worse cocktail drugs administered. Pretty unsettling story matter. considered eager professional sports reopen.

We criticize WWE recent infections don’t treat MLB/NBA/NHL way.

Just wait NFL wants get going “Church Football” starts protesting. Who’d thought places everyone dips hand bowl water, shake other’s hands half way eat bread -assed guy drink wine cup, would place disease spreads Lol . Wth Canada, given state things isn’t something proud of. complete fuck show USA. worst world, better hope better Yes vape dabs take kratom. Alcohol overrated ""By time wall's done getting built, we'll ones trying get it"" hope not!  beliefs steer laws live by. Avoid reposting information.  Avoid reposting information. Agree. Store staff carry pepper spray. looks like Disney Handsome Jack think missing point lol. stay inside, also don’t stay inside. Cool. Europe combined US

Like this?

 ""And tell ya name game boy, call riding gravy train"" paramedic. would like change masks get new ones. spray disinfectant reuse them. healthcare worker fellows getting ppe need. lot people wouldn’t hospitalised better health I'm Denmark. Though see quite clear replying thread something UK.   Missing multiple California hot spots list - care explain why?

Also please cite source instead providing 0 information showing cities increased rates (you’re missing many major cities California well) often see lot misconception threads. Unfortunately Fortunately airlines capital intensive business. airlines typically burn 100+ million dollars per day. currently reduced capital burn $40 million day. little math says bailout money given last 3 4 months most. 

Most costs fixed like paying employees minimums guaranteed contracts. Paying airplanes, steep airport fees, maintenance come them. It’s often expensive planes sit ground keep moving reinspected brought back service. executives cut salaries back.

My belief airlines never allowed buybacks future stocks taking government money. event saved money may able stay afloat additional 3 6 months. Unless travel returns normal airlines would go within year without making dramatic cuts jobs. major airlines believe travel wherever return 2019 levels earliest 2022 2023. That's reality... press stuff saw Disney made sound like idea reopen Disneyland. :) Lol thinking thing. would freedom speech, though.

I type guy thinks ""I might agree say, defend right say it.""

Unless people advocating something clearly dangerous, want tape anyone's mouth shut. updates? better? Wait, there's place Canada called this? Like amazing Canadian bar/cookie/brownie thing? absolutely magical. Yeah brainless grandmother rambling want prevent word God spread. Stupid cunt possibly weaker virus, better treatment

do info either these? Well, guess point always know someone wear mask. I'm means example, wear mine regardless.

But people health issues like COPD, conditions makes prolonged period wearing mask health hazard. I’m saying deaths going down. yesterday. We’ll see happens tomorrow. slight increase 7 day doesn’t necessarily indicate upward trend. school district Florida given option sign online classes school classes. kids mother opted online classes doubt teachers tested Janitor plus kids come around knows spreading shit affect family members come home noticed suspicious removal posts site comments? happening original subreddit virus came out. post removed mods. I've heard people recently mods first I've experienced Yikes. sounds scary. Bubonic plague isn’t even virus famously killed 30–60% Europe without becoming less deadly. Lmao sub going ignore everything disease? Well, although dont agree HR’s decision, partially correct. Yesterday, wore mask approximately 10 mins, checked O2 % inside mask. Mine 19.3 . Normal air 20.8. Good/bad? stated “medial personnel wear em day theyre fine. But, everyone takes mask desk, kinda defeats purpose wearing one all. know Rona stays airborne long time. Good luck  governor probably thinks good thing. True mean literally don’t understand people can’t blame protestors gathered groups 100s thousands people told can’t go church. It’s hypocritical 100% matter believe in, maybe people asymptomatically spread 2 weeks, infected spread 2 weeks honestly doesn’t matter virus “low” death rate it’s spread near half unchecked. tens millions get infected amount death still going devastating. bar constantly moved higher higher metrics “not worry”. country complicit deaths thousands American people. yet air travel aok...  Oh god. fit uniform. fucking priority right now. gives shit mask looks. GAAAHHHHHH!!! Anyone else frustrated direct obvious correlation famous/successful/respected religious leaders America objective awfulness. It’s like read teach upside bible. wonder love Trump. ehh brasil looking good agree, censoring things would cause uproar whatever. yeah, putting warning video, would probably best. also properly educating kids critical think, proper research fact checks claims. 

What private schools teaches pseudoscience bs fact? Yes possibly happy possibly miserable feeling undervalued. terrible underemployment. People love brag unemployment numbers pandemic. Fail mention many people work two jobs, side gigs, work way much way little. I’ve even guilty taking job paid shit did. really needed job made compromise paid long run. Trumps chaotic, half-hearted, political response conflicting messages pandemic much problem! 

He instigator ""reopen now"" protests berating governors proceeding safe speed based science. refusal wear mask horrible example public!

The problem Trumps lack leadership, intelligence American people - maybe intelligence! WFH sustainable various reasons. efficient, people miss dynamic co workers dont like staying home day. churches. ELCA Lutheran Conference Florida committed remaining closed. California opens August too, unfortunately us. used corporate catering bay area lot tech companies. That's coming back anytime soon need find canadian wife. Blame fucking POTUS this.

Does little late.

And heb understand fuck. posted time. went one comments. Sorry. Haha guy head far Trump's ass, he'd realize hard slapped ICUs, 85% ICU patients Covid-19? anybody stay conditions born into?

Uprooting hard, hard financially, socially, emotionally, picking everything going somewhere completely different cards many people. work restaurant Alabama, whole state seeing massive covid increases, 50-60% staff wear masks either nose chin all. I've tried say something apply social pressure get give shit enough wear right 5 months gave up. goddamn frustrating people end dying peak weeks. Kind ironic could end slowly suffocating death one rooms attended SXSW panels in. swag attendees time. Or, perhaps, figure live it? Sorry, maybe throw anything intelligent fear able recognize.  poster child reason rest world laughs ""we want get pregnant! Sure screwing 5 times day without fprm birth control, WANT get pregnant!""

Whether call Covid parties, intended Covid parties, Covid parties. making backyard ovens luxury backyard death, discovering virus long-term detrimental consequence people's health. what's venger then? fear even vaccine, may get boosters every couple months. Add healthcare costs that, along apathy stupidity perma-fukt. admittedly pessimistic view, think it’s worth considering planning accordingly. Right, deadliness isn’t necessarily evolutionary advantageous (although may correlated increased transmissibility, virus reproducing faster also causes become sicker). Eh, you’re alone right field spit, think it’s fine.

Maybe infield along base paths.  well christians circumcising something here... can’t build immunity population three months, even possible build all. mean, just, fuck us rational Americans even point much working us. really starting feel like there's way us able avoid catching damn virus  intend comment? point? really great places mandating masks means absolutely nothing enforced listened to. state mask mandate since last month barely increased number people wearing them.

Americans simply give damn. That's it. thing would truly enforce mask policy mask wardens (hopefully dressed like plague doctors whatever reason) wandering beating unmasked people cudgels. yeah, last week 2-4 states decline gone away Seriously, also lives jobs hard enough confronting engaging fights random customers make jobs lives 1000x's harder. Excellent deductive reasoning 🙂 god hate people much. Stanford's Hoover Institute is.... 


Quite problematic. entire pandemic.  good?  Potter executive Cigna involved healthcare reform. vocal recent years come swinging Cornavirus might addressed differently different system place. 

Of interest interview CBC **listened to** read also interviewed yesterday Hill's Sunrise tv program **watch** Literal Darwin awards handed churches. That’s irony right there...  means best times, govt tends be, let's call inefficient. screwball running things, adds level malice govt top inefficiency. silver lining competent limited worldview, thus limiting damage malice do. Imagine intelligent, even keeled, possessed level malice. Yeah, well that's one four teacher said discuss. Politics, sports, religion, forgot last. Oh yeah, womans age. Okay pretty funny, fair. cringe summary, they're idiot children playing idiot games. Good riddance. would say it’s time find new church. hope parents agree. feel bad you.  Thank you. 36 states ‘increasing’ 14 states ‘mostly same’

Not good sign isn’t even category ‘decreasing’ 🤦 yawn peak yes, peak leading cause death country month, hard get much higher that

also, said ""going down"" point either stable going depending treat holiday weekend Even isolated room infected persons room? room exposure could see point. least could potentially filter bad rooms air spread thought entire HVAC system via return air duct. No? 650 coronavirus cases linked nearly 40 churches religious events across United States since beginning pandemic, many erupting last month Americans resumed pre-pandemic activities, according New York Times database.

If 650 people got injured single church result terrorist attack launched fanatics religion, imagine reaction churches. golden rule would seem come play somewhere decisions congregating pandemic.

Edit: Changed 650 died 650 got injured, NYT count referred new cases deaths. please link FHM clarifying people elderly care get PPE? memory FHM press briefings, continuously said PPE elderly homes much region home decide, much ""case case basis"".

Not mention scandal Swedish Work Environment authority backtracking PPE recommendations align lenient recommendations FHM ""avoid difficult debate"" ( comments FHM somehow sort stance back April promoted kind sufficient PPE standard care homes seems misguided oversimplified best disingenuous worst. understand childcare problem right now, think opening schools solution problem. solution needs found, sure, opening schools make bad situation worse. could focusing ways address situation, like fighting UBI halt non-essential work parents could stay home kids. options someone better ideas. opening schools solution. puts poor people risk dying, even. could working parents spread virus, schools kids too.

I don’t think understand math works. USA total sum places new infections new deaths. Infections rising places deaths aren’t rising accordingly. That’s 2+2 = 4 works. 

If cherry pick places rising deaths rising cases, also cherry pick places rising cases falling deaths. USA overall sum shows deaths declining cases keep increasing. That’s fact. Yeah, really wrecked straw man. would co-avengers ;) atheism about, all. Atheism says evidence god believe exist. 

You’re also wrong saying don’t live religious beliefs. plenty religious beliefs atheists quite comfortable living with. good number saner 10 commandments example. 

Also *Mormon girlfriend got Tested Dallas last Monday, waited 5 hours line one last cars get tested day. 29th still results. running government business instead government.... worked Domino's years loooved making them. think check pizza subreddit? lol Conservatives find reason hate Trudeau, regardless does. 28 y/o here.... vaguest memories societal stability. fucking sucks. politics.

You’re refusing look science. Washington right BC START US surge cases.. California, see point. 

The real difference Asian population. might tell us Stanford doctors aren’t real scientists  course going happen put religion science. current GOP, including Trump administration, attempted politicize everything squeeze votes them. science inherently political, Right demonized order appeal peoples belief's, matter wrong are.

But able learn initial mistakes. much wrong here. mind boggles

for example sweden-- Per million people, Sweden suffered 40 percent deaths United States, 12 times Norway, seven times Finland six times Denmark, ECONOMY SUFFERED HORRENDOUSLY. 

They literally cautionary tale locking stupid comment many levels. July 29th first student day parts Southern Indiana. biggest difference they're explicitly paid confrontational, expected run tills stock shelves whatever.

(Not saying lowest paid workers dealing this, within system have, think reasonable hire security specific reasons like mask compliance) means cant find mask, aren’t trying. Thousands options online, big box stores selling masks. went Lowe’s random items hundreds boxes available sale. Many distributors normally handle products offering masks PPE wholesale level well, anybody go Etsy order many masks need. Gotta keep untaxable donations flowing! I’m teacher Kansas supposed start back August 19... still waiting guidance sort plan.

Add “getting sand face mask beach” “gifts brought us 2020” specifically. Biblical scholarship Pete Enns, NT Wright, Rob Bell. Enns definitely goes deeper OT stuff many, still lens Jesus, much Wright. Please elaborate. 

Missing face-to-face interaction/co workers reason WFH unsustainable. like staying home day? Get work hours take walk. Walk lunch break. Work outside. 

For many jobs, WFH totally sustainable efficient, mater leadership says. virtual crap ton loadsharing/tracking/workflow software that, long company invests little, allow company work efficiently remote staff. tracking software help weed anyone pulling weight, like would office environment. 

Just cannot physically see employees daily basis mean sitting home feet beer lemonade. Churches exact procedures.

And song goes ""ya gotta pay troll toll ya wanna get boysshole"" preferable alternative obviously giving million kids coronavirus. that's right means real % meat packing plant % CDC released...something jive that.... not? Wait. What? Oh yeah, think it’s ridiculous huge NBA fan. saying compared cruise ships disney - NBA probably safer. unfortunately. saw video going detail can't find similar good article. necessarily specific drug preventing respiratory problems reaching ventilator stage using earlier/different interventions. went really strict, super right wing church liked guy Christian went (sorry, Jesus), &amp; trying become spiritual anyway, lordy preacher bring bible passage new testament women subservient husbands &amp; say. yes, I'd say there's stuff criticize. 

What's worse, preacher went talk way way interpret bible, interpret exactly like holier art thou ass does, matter much believe Christian God, evil going hell. 

My butt noped super quick. see anything wrong Christianity religion. People going believe believe. world weird make sense somehow, good you. way preacher acted like knew god meant seemed pretty, uh, cultish? Anyway, found better, non-culty boyfriend worked out. Employers purchasing masks employees, ample cloth/disposable masks acquire now.

&amp;#x200B;

I run supply chain 100 person manufacturing plant. $.50/mask able provide 5 cloth masks per employee; required wash weekly wear 1 clean mask per day. require come plant/office - responsibility make sure done safely possible. four churches road Sundays packed ripe picking. massacres committed past whoopies? Switzerland one aswell.

Now lets say Ireland, keep Swiss one, compatible, get Irish one aswell? believe real number much higher though, simply way tell many people it. pretty nasty cold lasted 1 week March, maybe had, maybe cold. Back March test people like could still breathe fine fever less 101. asymptomatic cases counted unless contact tracing known COVID case. People holding going hospital last months. Seems like lot comfortable going getting treatment. Also, local hospital start allowing elective procedures weeks ago. sure places policies currently are. appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* article aged well far know used NYC? people city already virus running rampant month half. tested every resident active infection anti bodies guarantee numbers would shock you. logic would Cuomo hailed “hero” ordered nursing homes accept infected patients, effectively murdering thousands people Desantis war criminal state 1/10 deaths NY larger population. Lol I’m done pointless discussions people refuse accept way things wrong. fun staying inside till 2027, us capable seeing things returning lives 👌  well instead getting defensive get angry vote better next time /r/thatshowthingswork Gotcha, read wrong accomplishment. full horrorshow this. Americans could used experience prepare confront situation similar outcome right now. 

But would taken little self sacrifice community respect responsibility. forefathers would spit faces could see petulant, soft, spoiled children become. literally shameful American right now. love fellow man gone? fuck inforcing shit though? Cops around shit corona mandates. seen heard person business reprimanded way. treated like Jay walking. figured like everywhere that's shit sticking fan like someone put diaper Yeah it’s pretty eye opening. thought hated people literally want go middle Montana hermit Yeah, reported everywhere know why. get clicks suppose. YES!! What's matter Colonel Sanders? Chicken? mask, service, questions. questions NEXT! Oh trying early on. remember quotes like ""Ontario open business"" similar silliness Alberta's premier. 

Except corrupted much US has, saw least sense eventually serving defend lives citizens. Yeah sucks America become Team vs. Team B landscape pandemic even became political issue rather human/health issue. Nuance dead, tribalism winning, one team's tribe anti-science anti-intellectualism terrible pandemic scenario. probably still lower 85% article neglects remember whatever percentage hospital covid covid. whatever % goes top whatever normal, plus whatever additional due delays elective surgery medical appointments. 

the % covid patients hospitals ICU steadily growing, especially areas elective procedures stopped. really 'free' intention transactional? Definitely helps lower bar. Went nice beach GF weekend. never courage before. since masks NJ/NY usual now, 100% outside, weird, said let's give shot. nice experience masks let us ease experience without really worrying seeing anyone knew work. downvote comment above. helped us get idea. graphs clearly show spiking infection areas, deaths rising. rest country hasn’t caught up, US graph falling (besides states NE hit hard early learned lesson better south west).

In places mention infections rising deaths falling...that’s death lags. That’s whole point COVID deniers don’t seem get. literally AZ TX two weeks ago - tons cases, lowering death rate.

You’re taking argument used FL/TX/AZ/etc (at least death rate low) applying whole country, relying averages pretend least death rate low nationwide.

Now death rate turned around multiple states going up....how many states increase recognize scale problem? 

It’s blind optimism pretend suddenly increasing death rates states mentioned miraculously stop. relatively untouched (for now) states somehow escape virus without taking severe precautions.

And see optimism really isn’t combatting thing effectively. live sister son. There's little room unfortunately. option though. lot headlines churches get posted reddit, think majority churches closed pandemic. go NY Times database tracking list, big outbreaks mostly prisons meat processing facilities. 
 biggest known clusters nursing homes, food processing plants correctional facilities, places people packed close quarters little opportunity social distancing. 
 
Not saying change, especially states erupting again, sort makes sense given many churches closed. reopened fully bets off. church opening up. many precautions. congregation split half come every week. Social distancing every pew. Face masks required. 45 min instead 2 hours. one entrance open, singing, sacrament taken gloves, masks, sanitizer, bread put separate cups people keep throw away themselves. mingling afterwards. Everything deep cleaned afterwords, anyone even remotely sick elderly risk cautioned stay home still. Basically, church ordinances gathering important, would get anyone sick. way churches open, area higher risks. additional gathering done online like we've weeks now. really want face Jesus, knowing others done him, face fact carelessness got others killed? Online school doesnt work. Kids middle school/kindergarten simply dont understand it.

In high schools, everyone mutes themself goes sleep. Nobody responds, complete shitshow. So, primary goal divert ambulances medical facility area accepting patients. hospital rides expensive emergency department receives lot walk-ins.

When know need admit someone capacity, things might support patient.

If they're bad enough go top list, we'll admit start supportive care (oxygen, medications, labs, get scheduled imaging, working transport, etc). necessarily bed point try find place sit bed becomes available. 

For patients require admission capacity cannot find facility does, take contact information, they're assigned care coordinator, notified bed becomes available. 

We always try treat may medication breathing treatment bed becomes available.

The care coordinator checks waiting list admissions twice day reprioritize lists. also actively look openings hospitals. Yeah let us know, I'm curious Yeah. legacy one point pride. Workers aren’t blame - governments failing provide basic income everyone keep us safe. Nobody position choose staying safe covid putting food table. political system can’t keep people financially stable *pandemic*, system failed. 

It’s sister’s fault, it’s America’s fault. Source? Counties, countries. Like county Tennessee, seeing higher ever hospitalization cases; schools starting EARLIER planned (for reason) two weeks without solid plans place. face masks required lot them. There’s absolutely way infections decreasing Arkansas, state’s culture doesn’t allow downward trend without lockdown. went college there, Evangelical majority Southern state there’s chance churches stepped control this. piggy friend said. Stop gaslighting already sick bastards. $2.13 hour it? Good god need tipping 100% instead do. That’s outrageous! area PA. way schools reopen safely, way socially distance one either Well American, course crazy gather large groups. big BLM sympathy protest country, people idiots.

However, evidence fact contributed much. largest BLM protests Florida, Texas Arizona. country effect, 18 people hospitalised whole country.

Therefore, blaming BLM projection. blame country's spike lies reopenings lack social distancing general affected states. First time 3.5 years seen White House respectful sentence. Lel nobody cares constitution, document raped since 1800 left ditch die. large Vancouver.

Vancouver received title ""most Asian city"" outside Asia. can't believe people still trust entities used sell literal tickets heaven. thought 11 year old passed away Milton too? Also important:

Hoover Institution
The Hoover Institution Stanford University public policy think tank promoting principles individual, economic, political freedom.

Aka, fight right party (during pandemic) Also something like 1/10th travel, even less. Ontario Quebec would many many cases seeded border closed. Alternate days? believe plan K-8 Columbus either self-paced online kids split groups half go Monday Tuesday half go Thursday Friday.  
 
But, yeah, math class 40 students trailer back day. schools crowded distancing gong really, really difficult downright impossible. must say bizarre reality, people nothing wrong, masks, oblivious... Meanwhile, I'm always masked up, careful avoiding situations people congregate, etc. honestly know feel anymore... ""Grocery day"" Thing household, that's capital T.

Other new addition calendar, time changed much, still feel like goes much fast. Nothing change fucking orange buffoon office. Ranked 3rd worst nation public education. Arizona internet explorer states. People BC avoided Washington day overnight trips much earlier east coast avoided visiting New York. Also, proximity lower hit state big deal compared proximity higher hit state. Chances Americans coming BC WA less likely infected anybody coming QC IL, NJ, NY, Also pants work let ding dong hang top, yet see many people wearing noses. mean you’re definitely right. people probably couldn’t even name 3 hockey players. hockey players right actual household names bar named city way around. Think way: one two five stores mandate masks, they're going pay security, pay sanitization cleaning people, lose sales people go elsewhere, etc. good humanity society, negative store it.

Meanwhile, stores choose take Covid seriously going save money cleaning, potential customers, likely make money. small cost people's health. like smoking-vs-non-smoking restaurants again. People fought that, too.

Making stores choose whether require masks creates perverse incentive that's net negative us. That's government regulation needed - somebody create rules stores must follow. Flatten playing field requiring everybody take precautions.

I think PR bullshit all. Government regulation super important right now, stores want stay competitive other. r/nobodyasked Old number 100 million deaths. New number 28 million deaths. Still cool? Great idea, middle surge lets re-open! 'merica first! Beautifully executed get info 2 younger brothers doctors. sit regular briefings COVID treating patients since March.

They say masks help worn properly, cleaned regularly, also say get real protection need something better cotton bandana. entire point 90% people see wearing good masks wearing properly simply acting placebo.

I believe issue information hear conflicts believe true instantly right coming ""unsavory source"" call it. could be. I've also heard direction, people try make things seem like covid get funding something. hope bias would small here, something kind difficult track without independent audit. ""Nope, double-down!!!"" - Orangeypuss Rex  1 month since lockdown lifted Moscow, point there's barely anyone wearing masks, even though like +600 700 cases day (it's going slowly, occasional spikes 700-800 cases). Almost private clinics Moscow test kits available $35 - $50, I'm really sure whether clinics report positive results local authorities.

Either gonna fine we'll completely screwed like US :/ I've also heard there's gonna kind anti-government protest July 15th, oh boy good time kind thing. removed longer relevant source. would OP post this? It’s misleading. FB. people insane good day. trying rationalize crazy. conflating two subjects.

Saying support type gathering, measuring whether type gathering effect two different things.

My point BLM marches seem little effect. Therefore blaming BLM country's spike dishonest. doesnt mean support them. never did, stupid. won’t argue we’re anything well. willing take time explain strategy, I’m willing listen! Well, comment easily provide proof. 

Can yours? would vape....it damage lungs, right? Schools without students now. almost guarantee God came earth he’d annoyed people excusing stupidity religion. calculations don’t mean virus isn’t dangerous – number lives lost due COVID-19, even tough shelter restrictions, dwarfs number deaths due flu. totally agree unspoken hope. like... might take years lose accent blend in, y’all welcoming newcomers? love Red Sox picking fights. fucking shit frustrating half population screwing everything rest us taking serious. Back march postponed wedding till April 2021. However still wanted get married going small immediate family wedding September year. starting look like even possible way things going. really hard take personally people keep fighting safety precautions. reality wedding, truly feel sorry small business owners lost loved ones. I'm sure bunch Canadian National Embarrassment people complaining lockdowns (in Canada) constitution. remindme's setup. asked them, told better harm lockdown still save lives. 

I asked lockdown kill people given countries locked without problems, pivoted third world countries.

Because logic them. told ""If lockdown continues, economy collapse everyone die."" matter happens, opening back pretending bad. uh....no? anyone got sick last 2 yet die recover (most likely) denominator eventual % moved back far agree you. 

9/11 still something US really reconciled. keep wanting avoid talking extent lot people really know full story.

We soldiers fighting wars ""because of"" 9/11 alive 9/11. US death rate slower worldwide good news! /s 

If US death rate like every 5 seconds we'd trouble. whole pandemic quite clusterfuck. Public health authorities bullshitting public, countries advance warning seemingly preparing it, numbers hard make sense thrown around willy nilly... fuck's sake people throwing shit fit wearing mask? 

Masks mandatory city Canada little while. really issue. spitters coughers vast majority puts something face gets life best can. **singing** fuuuuuuck IIIICE Without 600, ill making 151 week state. 600 month doesnt even cover rent (with roommates) city man

Anti-maskers: ""We're listening LALALALALALALA"" please stop qualifying that, hey, don’t look people 70, numbers aren’t bad. 

The flip side statement you’re okay geronticide (the killing abandonment die elderly). goes say, it’s bad without pre-existing conditions. 

I fall younger, pre-existing condition category, I’m certainly willing follow rules suit stats, other’s stats far less rosy others. stay calm.. united states number 1 always.. take time Even better details:

[Ferocious US surge adds 1 million new coronavirus cases 28 days hit 3 Paid China bill gates Cali report 10,000 new cases property damage? No? disaster! /sarcasm Sweden tried bring transmission rate lower voluntary measures personal responsibility. 

The Swedish approach horribly misrepresented US. US media claims free business usual Sweden. voluntary recommendations probably comparable recommended elsewhere. experiment would voluntary measures sufficient. 

Yes Sweden higher death rates neighbours imposed strict lockdowns quite well. 

Swedes mostly took upon asked them. took care voluntarily. commended it. 

The difference large Freedumb movement Sweden roots anti-intellectualism shunning personal responsibility. 

 Imagine US politician ever saying something like this:

*""We adults need exactly that: adults. spread panic rumours,"" Prime Minister Stefan Löfven said televised address nation last weekend.

""No one alone crisis, person heavy vaccine come months time. though best guess would stop social distancing end like Florida eventually least county colorado, restrictions less equitable churches gyms bars theaters. limited capacity, social distancing must place, masks recommended.

You great disparity rules followed, but... america. Thoughts Prayers go churches faces eaten leopards.

Who could known? happens lot! think colleges attempt season. it’s going end getting cancelled couple games. someone bagged groceries, I’m insulted would compare us United States. hate fucking country. Fired worrying family's health pandemic. Disgusting New York also lot people without covid dying heart attacks want go hospital. CDC published report deaths heart attacks exploded 400 per week March 15th high 1700 per week -April 15th New York. I’d post graph can’t link Florida would rather mandate masks Coronavirus protect antibodies, mandate face masks protect people know shit works. People hospitalized 10 days - 2 weeks start dying. know deaths lag behind. let fucking idiots running country try convince deaths plummeting. 

This blatantly false, dangerous due risk people putting into.  agree 100%! brought management team laughed at. said best arrogance/ignorance We'd probably focus treatments vaccines. It'd different challenge, we'd still find solution

Edit: either that, would mutate less dangerous strain natural selection love megachurches literal mini-malls inside them.

Better yet, imagine Bill Lee actually stones make statewide mask mandate instead passing responsibility mayors. honestly thought entire post satire called idiots. Unbelievable!

That’s true. block ranges UV light windows still let decent bit (around half I’ve read) UV. get sunburnt window although takes lot more. takes two tango tribe bad different ways. like either tribe. new cases either.

Otherwise people die, cases reported, death percentage likely remain similar. Thoughts Prayers. xox earns respect coming clean “after”, much like many Republican’s turned Trump declare retirement.

Lol share worlds largest unprotected border dont see numbers rising people running away; Mexico border matters why?? BLM protests incompetence (although arent perfect). Trump done job all, he's ignored everything amd everyone.

But right let's count NY, NJ fake right? love went China hiding cremations sulphur maps hey death rate okay 

Has one seen New York dead body morgue pile up? None bodies look nursing home age. would suspect would provide crossover protection mutated strains. Yep. would even consider starting attend church full lots midst this. event stupid anymore. weaponized ignorance. Stupidity excusable problem, ignorance fucking choice. where'd trolls go? miss downvotes &lt;/3 nearly 1/4 US cases last 2 weeks starting math minimum 25% ideal   guessing Pence check boss making comment. Please tell ninja.  nice map protests. concentrated New England Rust Belt.

 Exactly. even bother reopening going close second deaths start? learned lesson opening bars restaurants, need take 2 schools, know it'll end back online. 80% Evangelicals voted Trump 80% Evangelicals voted Roy Moore, clear systematic institutionalized problem. I'm really curious see many pro athlete infections wind career ending. suspect it'll enough people take notice. death rate dropping!! Muh narrative! /s able reliable ordering filters? poked around Amazon random websites, everything seems kinda shady.  think county CA reported thousand extra cases actually days before. stuck cases past, like normally happens. note logs region. think giving good education, better founding primary secondary (high-school) much greater impact. Also, laws blocking religion schools public space important. (as vocal every personality type.)

Believing religion mental illness, personality quirk something harmless, cannot 'talked' people. normalized law protected cultural stuff charts... much want protect help people mental issues, want personal thoughts dogmas significant impact society world around us.

You give better education separate church state force wait new people born immunity superstition. older die old age. like people mostly racist default ancient times basic animal xenophobic instincts. changed mostly generations passing out, people 'changing minds'.

But best keep hoping talk people religion. admire patience efforts. Christian's follow Levitical law. us today.  Churches help covid protests don't. previous ones did. Lmao. want someone orders Dijon mustard hamburger president again. literally biggest white house scandal ever. sorry hard time trusting numbers coming Texas Florida. common cold always around, wide variety viruses cause I’d imagine aren’t affected summer much others. re-opened 20 cases day population 9 million.

Staying closed 20 cases day nuts.

Their problem locked early - basically locked hardly cases, crushed nothing, herd immunity they're hammered it.

All places locked early seeing second waves - look California. 

Whereas places locked cases building (New York, Britain) seeing degree herd immunity cases deaths plummeting despite protests, re-opening etc.

The moral story timing important. either once-and-done lockdown. lockdown early, trash economy good reason, disease comes back lockdown again, time good reason crushing disease, also crush economy second time. Honestly think said NY. appears one major universal flaw humans tend way reactive fail learn others proactive. CA bit different, received bunch flack claims overreacting. Texas/Florida/Arizona refused learn NY. NY (and USA) refused learn Italy South Korea. Italy refused learn China (it still clear going actions taken despite CCP trustworthy). Clearly, bot sow discord. think humans block you. even read research link? forced virus remain airborne rotating drum. that, settles onto surfaces.

This another misleading headline make people think thing remains air hours. I'm denier. I'm tired misleading headlines.

Please wear mask, wash hands, touch face, stay home can. That's I'm doing. work online marketing &amp; advertising. surprised *ever* go back fully 'office' model. experienced absolutely negative repercussions since changing work-from-home March. testament well Canada controlling this.

The article title really read... ""While unfortunate, Canada's precautions consolidated 80% deaths long term care/nursing facilities.""

Nursing homes different something like daycare (for example). ever sent kid daycare know **ONE** kid comes something... will. Regardless precautions taken inside facility. nature care centers like this. 

The difference Canada decides 'treat' illnesses discovered brought home. Advising parents seek treatments illnesses kids brought home. half US, say ""oh pinkeye (for example) go away. Keep thing"".

80% seems like lot numbers low. US 40% ish sort concerning. 80%+. can't nice things :-/ Sigh.

Deaths. Lag.

Do understand “lag” means? 

Infections increase, time passes, deaths increase.

The death rate increase lagged behind Arizona’s rise infections. death rate increase lagged behind Texas’ rise infections. 

Now LA seeing rise infections you’re actually believing happened states somehow won’t miraculously happen LA? death 7 day average LA clearly shows it’s plateaued instead continuing fall....exactly like states death rates started back upwards.

I’ve explained LA increasing infections lower (for now) death rate (deaths lag case didn’t get it).

Now explain think deaths never increase LA also recognizing states death rates going enough time passed “lag” pass by....should fairly entertaining. believe morning. waking goes freedom. lawyer. people sides political equation disagree. Although feel bad kids, kinda want kill ignorance virus Restaurants bad idea. Bars bad idea. Schools bad idea. Sports bad idea. 

If think I'm sarcastic paying attention. things stupid. almost like willpower. can't inconvenienced life temporarily different, irony things could normal shorter amount time wore masks. No. point COVID get really bad. get much worst. One day know anyone it, next day everyone it. Hospitals Doctors thoroughly overwhelmed. forced suffer without medical attention drugs. hope right fear may be. That... within tolerance. focus populous states, numbers, Arizona looks like state bound collapse. Pretty sure said thing March. care case numbers? Even rhinovirus sound scary focus case numbers. depends vaccine, oxford one based MERS vaccine already went phase 1 know safe. tweaked make effective SARS2. plus reason takes years takes years get volunteers, set get approval trials, etc. take years people examining data years. concern long term safely long term safety affects unlikely, safely problems people worry about, would show first days. 

so since heard anything bad MERS vaccine oxford created, would say SARS2 vaccine safe. yes, know long term safely affects something concern unlikely problem. realize people post something similar every while, however celebrate moment, introvert whole social distancing aspect great. enjoying commuting public transportation packed people, go social events every weekend, thing. Virtual meetings, online gaming, going walks, love that.

We literally somehow repeating whole situation w f consider washing hands thoroughly, considering amount dead people's blood that's it. White House Coronavirus Taskforce press conference Wednesday, CDC director said evidence kids transmitting disease. 

Meanwhile: Leopards 🐆 “I LYKE THA GRAFS LUUK LYKE FLORDA GATA ARMZ” New Zealand achieved fantastic. Nursing homes nasty horrible places. There's reason average stay couple months. sick infirm go die, healthcare workers paid nearly enough care much need. Everyday gets worse!! lol, firm grip going on.

/s LOVE genociding people reconsidering that. obvious happen, tourism industry pushing kids school sent email couple weeks ago saying school would open Aug 17, masks optional. must huge uproar parents next day sent another email telling everyone hold tight reevaluating options. got revised options yesterday, offering person instructions (masks required) 100% online. Thank goodness! worried going pull kid find another school offering online. 

So hold tight, hopefully school come similar guidance. No, not. small town church defied guidelines caused massive county wide outbreak directly led 2 deaths counting. still meeting spreading virus, post Facebook pave more. way shape form afford implement cdc guidelines 

not worry, politician make scientists change guidelines :| Dead. Lmfao ""but air nomads never formal army!"" one forcing others go outside, want take risk catching virus stay home.

They think media circus fake news. go going strong feelings. sucks. cannot impose jail time people asked quarantine exact reason: can't know. really give much damn word came from. entire point post punishing break quarantine wear masks. Unless prove people cause harm knew infected, cannot good conscious punish them, might hundreds asymptomatic spreader around, infecting others without ever realising virus.

If OK jailing people that, fine. oppose every turn punish potentially innocent person causing harm. mean demise indigenous people Brazil allows heathen destroy Rainforest less backlash. perfect plan Bolsonaro people humans soul. loll want kids go back school worried kids mental health, person experience. 

How kids carry infection parents. mental health kids parents ICUs potentially long term effects Covid. Let alone, god forbid, death parent this. kid mental health then?! fair cough acid reflux related day symptoms. got tested going visit parents. roommates came back negative well. seem infect known persons. Seems odd supposedly highly contagious. Also housemates tested negative well. 

That's I'm wondering people spread more? We’re already nation, it’s late. concerns plan reopen country August 1st - kind case number might cause little reconsideration. He's grifter. Czech Republic partially reopened. superstrict conditions, limited number pupils classroom, pupils different classes never meet.... etc. Kids wear masks. Funnily enough, whine them.

Yeah, think they've said number new cases countries big Romanian population Ask teacher often werent sick first year. NYC infection rate already started increasing begun open things up.

They opened daycamps near me. lasted ONE DAY everyone quarantined exposure. 

School good idea current predicament. wasted March-August Twitter feed, ffs. rock last 4 months? No, far right conservatives similar Trump. disturbing movement. Seriously, might well ask cat thinks. far change now. Yeah seen 568% deaths usual. Jesus, fucking, Christ. Apparently updating systems report July 4th weekend. Yes, really involved county local city councils vote. Bullseye! father's example admirable. displaying extraordinary leadership. mom, college professor, taking FMLA semester re-evaluate teaching spring ‘21 semester. bad vision can’t teach online doesn’t want risk contracting virus teaching face-to-face.

[And sort shit must dispiriting health care worker considering tour  Haha! thinking that. I’m Texas see smoking thought, “oh, everyday normal” regions different well! Oh man, need sour dough starter. I've seen many sour dough recipes pizza dough breads really want give shot. Us leadership like US political system many moving parts compared Canada. Lower governments strongly dependent higher governments here. Premiers PM strong level consensus. PM biggest 5 premiers agee, it’s likely done deal. Right probably Alberta rogue, done way better US part, lockdown. devil details, nobody quite hashed perfect plan. Oh, I'd still thought prophylactic effects, side-effects chronic tx non-starter. Guess stopped paying attention stopped French clinical trial, lol. 100k+ dead people? Ahhh it’s big deal! Gotta get lives! 

10 dead shooting that’s talk month. would country be?

Probably same. Tons people stupidly ignoring Fauci says anyway. It’s pretty common US cashier separate bagger bagging.

""More 650 coronavirus cases linked nearly 40 churches religious events across United States since beginning pandemic,"" Times says, ""with many erupting last month Americans resumed pre-pandemic number confirmed COVID-19 infections United States 3.1 million, meaning church-related cases identified Times account 0.02 percent total. face it, seem like ""a major source coronavirus infections."" something like 385,000 churches U.S., ones tied COVID-19 infections represent around 0.01 percent Christian congregations. 18 month old needed use nebulizer every month. I’m also concerned immune system becoming weak home Nobody told Trump schools already defunded. Consumer demand wont return pre-virus levels virus gone  Wow actual link, cited politifact source, that's almost journalism. Unfortunately source say think actually states cases undercounted lists set reasons why, something article mention. quote fr source article relies on:

""Indications due lack testing factors, number coronavirus cases undercounted, padded.""

Oh also mentions code Covid19, payment structure place placing patient ventilator. also breaks patient ventilator costs patients.

In short cites source agree Yea absurd. Like students wont walk campus workers potentially exposed every day campus. initial test might allow stay open extra couple weeks shit hits fan, much more. death rate matter, dont get become repub talking point. keep trying downplay severity virus. People Wuhan literally dropping dead streets. confirmed opposed assumed. shows much care public safety employees. simple FMLA. Work small business less 50 employees? Sorry - luck.

Worked less 1,250 hours 12 months prior company? Sorry - take seen latest Supreme Court Rulings yet, you. Everything running razor thin edge years now. Even COVID many people missed work days away able pay bill. 

Work teams understaffed co-worker cripple them.

Small business paying staff next months profit.

Big business tosses every spare cent bonus shareholder payouts nothing fall back downturn.

It's like took 'Just Time' production model applied every aspect life. God cleansing land stupid. I’m okay this. Getting really tired guy’s BS. one saying young healthy people don’t get sick. saying rarely die, rarely long term issues. don’t blame them. thought roller coaster half-full people wearing masks zipping around silence pretty funny tbh. Testing one, two, three: ideology. countries choose point laughably fake testing data China?

Alright buddy, let break basic math you. China “conducted” 90 million tests total. They’ve got population billion. So, no, they’re anywhere close testing citizens weekly.

The US population 330 million. would need conduct around 1.3 billion tests/month test everybody weekly.

The entire world combined (including fake China numbers) conducted 250 million tests. since start pandemic. You’re calling us 1.3 times total global testing past 5 months, EVERY WEEK.

You’re completely insane allowed MSM rot brain. Yeah, well US Covid free since Easter! Teaching different working supermarket, problem dealing dozens hundreds people per day close quarters, see big difference is. Depending age kids, subject, classroom setting, teacher physically separate kids people work restaurant retail store.  Death rates people 70 near 0%

...or denial science Yes virus eyes: shit there’s kid coming, better fly general direction! Oh no, can’t reverse course - better get breathed - damn kid!

Of course transmit contract disease whatever reason, degree us “adults”. interesting studied definitely can’t go back school usual. country done. Successfully. Yes, malaria turns yellow anemic. Also, test malaria dirt cheap easy Freedom isn’t free? agenda rediculous obvious take 10 minutes fact check stuff.  keep hand case someone forgets Portland Oregon. high cost living. lived ~~three~~ two mistake others rent still 800 factors regards infection. apartment complexes completely overrun infections? would heard major outbreaks like now. Worldometer note yesterday explaining distributed cases reported yesterday previous days. probably realistic depiction, isnt technically accurate terms many cases reported given day. whats going jersey, 93 new cases, 71 new deaths? real? Lets pretend churches. Even /r/atheism acknowledge cult like smaller churches find US big churches causing this. churches US switched zoom calls facebook live streams church services. ones causing corona also looked also going radical churches. Oh totally guilt trip. hilarious believe God you’re tithing to, don’t know knows regardless tithing takes place? news, water wet. wife experienced home-schooling; insisted first year kids, several reasons. Gotta say I'm glad got grasp it. knows keep involved. civil liberty begins ends right asshole time. mom that. works low functioning kids would able social distance. work one day July eligible, filmed lesson plans walked away.

She's high risk. 60 COPD smoking. Well trust people make sweeping generalisations groups, without learning group works. Oh wait, that's you. need put foot man stand protector family. Losing trip hurt financially better fucking dying spreading others! likely come contact tons people carrying disease. majority us employment directly tied health insurance, retirement, ability keep roof head food table.

This what's wrong US, ultimately. Yet people keep voting safety net, think going cost money. Hoover institute economic group strong leanings toward blacklisted word. remember publishing absolute trash early year claiming US would epidemic done something like 5000 deaths.

Then backpeddled hard claimed 10 times low. Except we're far beyond 50k American deaths. It’s tough personally super interested development droplet vs airborne. like said general public functionally 
doesn’t matter. mitigation efforts types viruses would still social distancing avoiding crowds. difference would widespread use n95 masks don’t supply anyway. Plus people aren’t even wearing double layer cotton can’t imagine tolerating n95 masks.

If virus truly aerosol would terrified. hospitals aren’t set pandemic type. example ER total 3 negative pressure rooms, that’s trauma 1 center. would need dedicated covid floors every single patient virus would spread anyone else floor wearing ppe. Well, given culture actually pro-birth anyone care? hope I’m wrong given school shootings dime dozen days, people actually stop realize fucked is? Also call like is.

#A closed church makes money. Maybe not. ~60k cases reported, backlog. WM stuck thousand cases previous day. Reapered sewed. This. may able flood area volunteers swabbing, swabs still route backlogged testing labs Sorry that, i'm California. looks like looking work, unwilling turn work approved unemployment here. makes feel stuck working potentially unsafe environment. Either unable provide family. feel fauci really angry right now. seems like lone ranger fighting dumpshit White House thought US entered WWII Pearl Harbor. Pearl Harbor happened sanctions Japan. I'm saying false narrative dangerous, questioning applies WWI WWII. recall correctly, WWI started assassination. could that. awhile since studied history.

Of course start wars preceded US involvement, could false narrative someone's part, recall specifics.

I would think applies Vietnam War war Iraq (2002 - ?). sure earlier ones. reopen things. need safely requires acknowledgement dangers national level. Keeping things closed long result special kind catastrophe. 

Ideally, get straight talk risks COVID highest levels. People required wear masks national level. indoor dining indoor bars national level. 

When accept reality dangerous situation in, give luxury SAFE, semi-return normal. denying risk (as many leaders done) prohibits us returning level normality you’re right...then close things larger scale. Wouldn’t you’d expect? Forget that, please tell hooker. Totally agree you. Also, research states used rotating drum keep suspended air, otherwise would settled much quicker. sick misleading headlines.  [Remember thing happened saw follow last week (I can't find now) looked old pro-brexit campaigns web sites. overwhelming majority gone trace. wish could find link again... Yes, jobs ones available aren’t safe work nobody taking precautions.  like due lack masks. attitude got mess. Doesn’t even take reading actual content parse title means. Survive air specific phrase certain meaning relates airborne viruses. think people w/o experience interpreting technical terms phrases tend trouble understanding exactly meant, especially condense information exchanges like title; unpreventable side effect topic. That’s media trusted experts supposed step in. Hoover Institute straight right wing ""think tank"" seeks justify policy stances, regardless consensus scientific community large, full stop. I'm still seeing many idiots blame China virus spreading much America. China's fault we're competing Brazil world's epicenter virus. MONTHS prepare - knew several months ever hit USA - literally nothing. we've plenty chances (both individuals government) last months mitigate spread virus, can't even agree wearing mask. That's something blame China for. see people places like New Zealand, Australia, Taiwan, South Korea, Germany, etc blaming China, unlike us, places actually handled problem like responsible adults like spoiled toddlers (""wahhh! wearing mask hard! need haircut! I'm putting life hold flu!"") blame everything goes wrong someone else. Sigh. want another one first lmao fun attend Calvary Chapel PA. meeting outside open air, sitting 6 feet apart people live household, wearing masks time need building otherwise seated within safe distancing (including parking lot seats hill). hand sanitizer stations set up, services live streamed, people high risks groups encouraged continue stay home now. 
Churches exercise right worship safe way respectful recommended guidelines. focus worship Lord share good news Jesus Christ, make political statements. article gives Calvary Chapels bad name, taking many steps keep people safe. Natural selection 2020? long death curve lagged infection curve march-May? Answer: 1 week. 

Plot curves yourself. 

Lag doesn’t explain it. does, avg age infected declined 70+ 35 yrs old. 

And guess what, 50 yrs old, 99.99% survive. deaths falling cases rise.  Oh, gall! could ever support man? decorum gone, America going? need true role model children.  100% aimed boardwalk towns. Ugly scenes holiday weekend raising rate transmission per infected forcing hand. Haha.. talk wife’s co-worker. She’s “not mask person”, thinks virus worse mild flu, FL making infection rate look worse “triple counting” positives. 

How would someone cognitively deficient hold Desantis company accountable?

I keep voting assholes, seem almost always win anyway. 🤷‍♀️ would increase positive tests. appear getting science confused tax evasion kiddy diddling. fair, pretty optimistic making travel plans asthmatic pandemic caused respiratory illness. anyone else seriously concerned future US job market? lot people saying jobs return, absolutely abysmal moment understand people staying afloat right now.  Wait, that’s actually thing? Dear lord. Well winter flu season well complicate things. could've saved trillions economy invested healthcare system like Canada virus care voted for, 1st grade level stuff... Depending condition bad. condition low O2 dangerous, sheltering anyways. reason see someone wearing mask newborn since risk SIDS. Even probably outside contact. Point being, problem masks hide house. Canada’s covid death rate per million people 0.48. 3.55 per million US. 
3.55/million dead seems lot higher 0.48/million dead. 
And “democratic” national government calling shots. Yeah say driven road CT 30 minutes Listen fucking maggots open books page 25 push-ups puke! lot folks showed years. vocal fundies tend non observant. Jesus could literally descend heavens second would criticize modern Christians:

“That’s Satan trying trick us.”

“That’s government hologram”

So set another remindme bot 2 weeks. 2 weeks, clearly spiked LOT, clear spiked first 2 weeks. never responded that. even messaged him, ignored me. went post history he's still going around 'calling bullshit' constantly numbers. Trust retail manager right fresh he’ll hope none ever experience. I’d like see survey people support Trump’s COVID response think history textbooks going say 2020. Im telling, makes sad, fallen far, fight this. think far better ways spend tax payer dollars bailing fucking “cowain yeast” lol “its cajun” ive much NASA going back space proud county late.

Masks meant protect protect others you. everyone wears works, USSR leaders tried cover also listened scientists tried reduce damage. Chernobyl happened Trump it'd total massacre. Someone explain big terrible problem is. School hours approximately 9:00 3:00 approximately 1 2 hours lunch gym, recess whatever. 5 instruction hours.

In two parent household would mean approximately two half hours per parent direct child supervision instruction. parents free commute lunch away home time.

I anticipate hearing whining ""socialization"" accomplished using Zoom similar adaptations board games inventive ways giving kids chance talk play. that's I'm wondering. keep level social distancing, mandatory mask wearing, states squeak vaccine? know LOT people follow rules, lot do, count something, right? state ""open"" still restrictions place masks required. counties shutting things small spike cases. I'm hoping enough keep virus (relatively) check. Oh no, money saved. tragedy... live Bergamo. stayed hard lockdown two months, 4 months peak still use lot mandatory precautions: mask indoor outdoor every public space. go bar must sit table. sit (because bar full), drink. lot people still working home. on. Oh shit, didn’t even see article ads. Thanks heh bad, remember mid august friend mine muck going school like, ""Summer school?"" fall semester, heh canada go back school tuesday first monday september, could never imagine gong back school august. No, BLM people protesting policies designed keep safe. specifically protesting policies designed hurt them. Stop false equivalency. love see assumption based of?

United States crime since 19th century, possibly earlier, I'm certain.

Violate public health order = crime.

Ignoring mask laws, gathering large groups, ignoring science, putting others danger, taking guns government building protest haircuts, holding rallies, churches groups, everybody defying orders infecting other. one bad decision another, leading doom. still, Trump pushing universities reopen fall. goes. I'm anti-vaxxer current rate testing would take....err...um...carry 1.....a couple years It’s good thing Trump administration cutting funding testing. less sick sick business guys get dollars again. Way way sooner lol country 65 million people, even moron-to-sane ratio astronomically low, find moron given enough time.

Sure people complaining, fuck tiniest minority. 

I actually impressed proud well held on. People turned TV 6 check next rules, fucking followed them.

Mask tomorrow? Fine. gym? Fine. Fill form go buy food? Fine.

The Karen personally heard complaining shops last week. gave shit employee asked put mask on, claimed law forcing it.

The manager showed up, said ""no mask, shopping"". put mask on.

Yeh idiots, really isolated incidents get big numbers. think long completely screw november least start make amends. brother law works American, they're process paying longest serving employees trimming staff, too. Yes country put sports education every level. comes time trust science group don't. paying dearly. 1st quarter getting crushed Newsom &amp; Garcetti

Saying masks bad yelling fire theater, except much larger bodycount.  turns 3d printer jpow along. doesn’t mean state closing fucking idiot world, outside select countries, seems handling COVID fine. said, America's suffering certainly intertwined hubris. Pride goeth fall that. god, govt going try force normalcy matter what. sad reality TV host turned White House circus, Morons like believe POTUS. Oh please, people never anything intentionally. 

They’re still 100% sure sex causes babies earth round. :( Someone know got mad N.J. Gov. “treating like children”. people can’t see mirror. someone warned people would happen!! well that's lazy Yep. I’m student couldn’t get unemployment stimulus. go work keep depending parents literally everything. know I’m lucky even option. supply chain would shit multiple times long. order processing one state gets shut while, manufacturing another state gets shut later, delivery delayed third state sales. similarly government/business travel stop going one state, they'd reschedule stuff places, would cancelled places shut down. 

you'd effectively shut country without benefit least.  get exactly one moment: Now. past memory, future may may there, anyone could die tonight.  now. 

That said, older, retired guy phrase: ""well there's six months I'm never going get back"" certain tang it. Get real , Ontario Quebec one major issue provinces have, seriously large number snowbirds.  Snowbirds returned March. Vancouver Victoria even snow, let alone snowbirds.

The majority cases Ontario Quebec traced China Italy travel returning USA. That's unique snowbird phenomenon. Ontario Quebec leaders, taking border far seriously feds. Begging feds take airport screenings seriously, Trudeau Freeland lamented close border tot USA worried American military enforcing closure.  We'd better military still would likely make American border hoppers think twice.

BC product circumstances, spring break Ontario's well Quebec's. course would say that... news? Well generally good place reasonable conversation. ""Scientist Reviews Evidence-Based Scientific Findings Comes Logical Conclusion"" would say counties handle outbreak better US. states fine tho. people know train. said opposite, ""wait two weeks watch spike."" are. Give easy single guess saying anything now. sub period require teacher certificate. least TN way. one got paid $30 day without, could even without college degree. $55 day making $110 day subbed. That’s cuz GOP church’s marketing good consistent. make claim repeatedly back connection. Can’t fault people listening. ""It'll great collaboration!"" worse China... September worse August mARk beAsT Ok go bar Texas. Tell open is. never said Florida ICUs capacity. are. Go get education please. think Canada’s public health system coupled political implement testing tracing helped. wasnt perfect helped. Also, blindly reopening society arbitrary weeks matter numbers trending. You’re right dumb dinguses U.S., people we’re different So, USA 34,000 new cases one day. one day day.

Florida, NM SC called Sun belt majority.

I thought Sun kills virus. UV light. least surface. people still carry it. unexpecting carriers sneeze thinking they're allergies spreading sunbathing territory?

Meanwhile Italy well. lucky China Africa help. Seriously. long pandemic going last? We've four months, even long. excellent observation one isn’t brought enough. imagine life look like herd immunity effective vaccine ever.  Without looking, guess many ICU beds Arizona has, population 7 million.

The real question wholly inadequate number beds.  He's got scat fetish, loves watch Republicans already gag idea *feed* children schools, think accept giving free healthcare top?. want tax dollars pay ANOTHER HUMAN HEALTH? way. one true word word Trump. King Trump knows listen commandments open schools /s Every janitor, temp, sub, secretary, electrician coming campus 3 hours, visiting HS students, students’ fuckbuddies town nearby schools too?

Five UCSF volunteers Navajo Nation since April returning San Francisco. Three months wondering I'd run toilet paper pretty great too. got arrested wearing masks wouldn’t argue that. I’m assuming arrests made though sparked controversy? think BLM movement become self harming. movement responsible deaths quite innocent people past weeks. Many black. attempt negotiate bioterrorists.

They demand right harm others. demand right intentional infect others lethal disease.

It core philosophy evil. wanted know already may antibodies worry less. Lol yeah that’s do, sucks asssss left Arizona come California thinking would safer... far, seeing masks worn. Seeing crowded spots beaches. shame. flu bro.... /s know median age infected gone down; know median age tested positive gone down. 

a months ago, one ways get test old (and hospitalized, would also skew old). quite get point here. wish concerted effort unionization. mom's church one them.  required staff members wear masks left voluntary everyone else. lasted two weeks going online again. thankfully mom listened never went opened back nice two minutes, actually. Like miracle, magically disappear. isn’t perfect example God abandoning us. Here:

Israel long history self-isolation, beginning Exodus. Moses, sense, first public health official, instructing people God’s protocols community well-being. Though God’s people designed life together proximity, sometimes, health safety purposes, separation required.

Every year Jews around world observe Passover, commemoration stay-at-home order God. Lord confined Hebrews homes death passed (Ex. 12:23). nation’s obedience readied leave Egypt new homeland.

While en route, God gave Israel laws managing life together, including read personal hygiene regulations ensure public sanitization—all predicated premise Torah loving one’s neighbor oneself (Lev. 19:18). Leviticus 13:1–8 lays law concerning leprosy (a large grouping infectious skin diseases varying severity). consists 14-day quarantine, divided two seven-day examinations determine disease threat greater community. someone tested positive, publicly declare unclean. Sounds eerily familiar, doesn’t it?

In ancient Israel, though priests clear, well-defined sacerdotal functions, also operated custodians public health, assessing threat level greater community (a fairly progressive policy 1500 B.C.). Even King Uzziah live days isolation confirmed leprosy (2 Chron. 26:21).

God mandated laws well medical science could explain reasons behind them. Mishnah added rules triaging cases leprosy STDs—how quarantine, confirm positive cases, declare someone clean reintegrate back society.

Even New Testament, lepers practiced form “social distancing.” group ten “stood afar off” (Luke 17:12, KJV) Jesus approached village cleansed them. holy kisses (Rom. 16:16), embraces, high fives could exchanged (Matthew 8 excepted). However, Jesus’ approach signaled way mitigate infectious disease. compassion suffering insisted go established health system priestly examinations outlined Leviticus 13.

Rather Revelation 13 conclusions, think Leviticus 13 obligations 1 Corinthians 13 motives.

This 1 Corinthians 13 pertains. “Love patient kind. Love jealous boastful proud rude. Love demand way” (1 Cor. 13:4–5, NLT). Love expressed patience, kindness, forbearance, humility, courtesy, selflessness, empathy, perseverance. means giving certain freedoms temporarily ensure others thrive. pandemic, rather jumping Revelation 13 conclusions, consider Leviticus 13 obligations prompted 1 Corinthians 13 motivation.

Moreover, another 13th chapter guidance. Romans 13, read governing authorities “appointed God” (v. 1, NKJV). One main responsibilities government protection people. Though governments sometimes overstep bounds, general response citizens clear: “Let every soul subject governing authorities.” good Christian good citizen unless good citizen means bad Christian. God honored earthly representatives seen preservers peace (Matt. 5:9).

With coronavirus, simple equation applies: flatter rate viral infection, smaller number people die. doesn’t mean can’t protest draconian governmental measures, mean won’t disobey ungodly laws imposed unrighteous leaders. mean should, best ability, live peace people (Rom. 12:18). We'll roll back phases repub maskless morons going around spreading shit like wildfire. could near normal nooo freedums matter public health. Newsflash: freedum doesnt exist literal global pandemic. Deal it. to, theoretically, hope someone suffering covid 19 dies, would guy.... Hrm. Like needed another reason dislike Kanye West. What's point Right. I’m agreement that. 

Which following law wearing masks. Open office save money. way cheaper management expensive buildout tried pretend employees. America Florida world. I'm happy italian neighbors 🇦🇹 ♥ 🇮🇹 Nah - find reason charge convict something ship profit prisons friends own. way ensure money goes exactly want. worries much goes store even money spend. state already tax dollars contracts place - guaranteed money! Dude that's stroke. Go hospital They’re fucked either way? LOL would that? sniff liar Reddit. needed read two comments prove right. Maybe stop lying people look history worried it. 

By way, joking. parroting trump.

Vitale took Facebook write: “Are tired living dictatorship yet? happens people go crazy get tested. STOP GETTING TESTED!”

Vitale, however, wrote mass testing would give “the government excuse claim something happening happening magnitude say happening.”

Vitale’s comments mirror Trump’s Oklahoma rally: “Here’s bad part: testing extent, you’re going find people, you’re going find cases,” Trump said. “So said people, ‘Slow testing down, please.’” go states controlled lying politicians worship orange toddler. cover it. gonna say big talk ready last time immediately bent backwards Maybe virus care temperature, means exactly fuck-all Arizonans basically live indoors entire summer, hopping one air-conditioned environment simultaneously stupid fuck voting republican time

Source: arizona, people fucking stupid this. I'm thinking too. I’m putting mask face. That’s USA Hospitals: Hold beer that’s 5 deaths minute anyway. It’s going disappear.  

Libs = OWNED happens lose tenant still nobody's paying rent? different: teach kindergarten fyi:

\- Classes around 20 kids per class (sometimes high 25) Two kindergarten classes per classroom AM/PM schedule

\- Small classrooms 4 tables 6 chairs available table. child gets 1.5 sq feet space table.

\- Incredibly poor ventilation air-flow, classrooms literally growing mold vents

\- one window per classroom opens 3 inches.

\- 25 kids sharing in-classroom bathroom get cleaned class leaves

\- Snack eaten inside classroom.

\- Lack resources human-power properly clean disinfect classrooms thoroughly often.

\-Masks mandated, lets real... 5 year olds masks general

\-Kids masks constantly licking, poking, nose picking, eye rubbing, snot wiping, rolling around

\-Story time carpet 20 kids

\-Children sharing cubbies AM/PM class

\-Children coughing, sneezing, lack proper hand washing, properly hand washing literally thing day.

\- Sharing toys play time, children needing comforted (especially beginning school year) Children generally understanding boundaries personal space

\-Sharing library books, school supplies, crayons.

\-Busses.

As kindergarten teacher gotten used tissue, snotted on, sneezed directly face, licked, coughed mouth talking student, tugged snotty hands, children try talk inches face, course hugged daily basis. (Not complaining last one, saying kids get 6 ft apart.) aid, instructional assistant classroom. enforcing safety rules September. Oh, also somehow stay focused enough, ***despite literal danger catching little -known pandemic causing virus,*** teach kids read, write, socialize respectfully, math, think scientifically, learn social studies, build health habits, problem solve, form letters numbers, deal emotions, learn routines student (lining up, unpacking, raising hands, pushing chairs, waiting turns, etc.) Oh usually 60% students also learning English, teach too.

There difference someone going supermarket maybe 40 minutes, spending 3-7 hours day potentially infected child small room poor ventilation.

I LOVE job, love students. dangerous work now. He's crazy. image (and even longer realistic grasp on)... *thinks* looks better schools opening. kinda thing weird dictators make everything image... except he's frail absurd, still cost lives. wife hospice nurse. protocols place weren’t place even back April. It’s disgrace federal, state regulatory agencies dropped ball first place. Well half covid deaths US, end May nursing homes. 

Where live everyone wears mask. go grocery store, post office etc never see someone wearing mask. guess what? Covid still spreading county consistent pace. this? Well according it’s likely virus airborne. it’s likely already made it’s way population IFR amongst 60s super low. Likely both. 

Hey could wrong deaths surging. see soon it’s going happen, though.  ex Scientologist billion year old god Andromeda joined space navy assigned protect Earth.

[No, I'm declaring official moratorium complaining stupid decisions movies. Clearly apocalypse slasher movies prophetic human stupidity. yes keep knocking stock prices down! can't understand difference TESTS conducted confirmed cases mean hoax dude.

What weird hill die on. much dishonest compare sweden NY michigan, compare vermont density state equally sized.

also dishonest try compare sweden's senior population US senior population wanted compared individual state.

pick lane possibly everyone get infected eventually. 6 months pretty accurate idea 5% deadly rate. probably even higher think uncounted deaths missed lack testing. kill children. freaking idiot. dad close business years left planned retiring enough work. sad many small businesses we're going lose big businesses letting people go getting bail outs. ""lol 3 million sick people deserve born there""

Fuck dude. You’re going need explain point clearly. Every state max UI payment amount aside $600, money state- federal funds. state pays $504/week UI, received PLUS $600 per week. Michigan almost 3x population density Sweden there’s really comparison. students kindergarten.  saying that's is, antibody numbers seem low, ask epidemiologist case curve looks like population hits herd immunity, looks like. Steady, long rise hitting big numbers proportional population, (relatively) sudden, unexplained dive.

Sweden effed bad protecting nursing home residents, forever government's dishonor. I'm still sure right basic approach. Ummm idk maybe getting business??? Italians pretty catholic. Miracles heritage. Get cotton mask pocket filter. can't find N95 filter, put sheet blue shop towel pocket. good N95 better Milton also 16 year old girl coma life support COVID-19.

Her name Halene O’Connell family begging everyone wear masks. Please take moment look shot teenage girl see going through. devastation! happen kids Halene always healthy underlying health conditions, according Barlianto, previously lived Pensacola eight years moving Fourteen days ago, Halene woke fever nausea. parents took doctor, since didn’t shortness breath — one primary symptoms coronavirus — wasn’t immediately tested Stop preaching, please. People worked together before, work future. issue church examples done, minority.

Based facebook feed least 30 different churches across country half filled ""after service selfies"" people 2 inches apart clamoring good back brethren. video clips half dozen worship leaders front church playing instruments singing without masks much less 6' themselves. dozen people think they're clever found loophole using mask nose. get started ""ardent"" churches still laying hands dunk-baptizing shared tanks.

Yes, done, yes, responsible, can't rely masses people follow guidelines reliably leadership posting, sharing, preaching conspiracy theories hear. Here's good reading you:

 know. Anybody two brain cells knows this. sick enough ICU, there’s pretty good chance long-term issues. took get people wear seat belts go along indoor smoking bans. problem is, virus spreads exponentially, delay people accepting new rules leads lot cases. Secondhand smoke car accidents don’t spread like coronavirus does.

I remember resistance seat belt laws. dad didn’t want wear one. come around it, took while. lot resistance smoking bans restaurants long time. support national teacher strike! pay, safety! #teachersarentbabysitters Reformation 2

something, something boogaloo I’ve taken save frontline workers hassle. Karen complain management wants rude told put mask on, don’t work there. Downside don’t power enforce mask policy rude and/or public shaming doesn’t work I’m options. sample size incredibly anecdotal. know nothing genetics, conditions, weight, predispositions. sample size 4 incredibly, incredibly small. Reopened really fast. Also less 30 nurses contact tracing WHOLE COUNTRY. Well one active states especially NYC hub city. Scared get reinfected Fair point. PPE situation makes exceptionally dangerous healthcare workers. Unfortunately think majority hospitals stressed cannot denied even 'the middle nowhere locations"". people without covid cannot get care virus. everyone's local hospital issues, people take notice.

Living Florida still amazed things going are, even news been. folks around still far away even though 140 miles ICU's running low beds. realize virus care live, gets chance, infect you. Agh could seen coming? Hopes prayers. Would tough. live BK work Westchester. Lots people Please, we're new florida! y'all. south carolina currently third worst outbreak (per capita) world

IN WORLD 

and STILL, NOTHING done state level. outbreak worse BRAZIL. testing staying consistent (~7-8000 per day) percent positive still increasing (21% today) 

what fuck do? Holy shit stuff Chlorine dioxide  Like every country handled better USA. bad worst person helm worst possible thing happen century. think so. Theoretically, yes. Practically, no. definitely something know address. care enough people US.  feel like comparison little unfair.

I currently living Korea, watched happen. “church” similar Scientology anything resembling Christianity. reason got bad secretive - government went demanded name list everyone refused, like couple weeks.

This say haven’t irresponsible Christians well, Christians means immune ego stupidity. However, enough us already give us bad name would prefer people’s foolishness attributed us well. ""The Intermission""...? fancy Cornetto. would change? know source, he's fucking crazy.  Trudeau, BAKED! live AZ, BLM rallies big compared states better us. failing government, people. sick US response this, hoped city, New York, would cautionary tale, still large portion people calling hoax. means we're gonna get baseball, that's yes low bar. Source plz 0.4% symptomatic IFR 0.26% overall, estimated based numbers may 1st think june 1st, either way ton data really need make new estimate  situation here. lives sound similar, hah.

It's one reason try cut people slack wanting go back work, see friends, etc. easy sit around judge I've got relatively easy. .... there's open spaces move social distance... Move. think one avoid flying much possible.  

It high-risk activity. Texas GOP? makes sense. every state, arbitrary cutoff amount. Maryland 475$/week, alot people got screwed going back work simply making much.

The way CARES act written qualify atleast $1 state unemployment get extra $600. hospital data posted made think sky falling? Numbers facts dude, can't alarmist. 

Young people getting sick ending ICUs, even end dying. facts. Sharing information encouraging younger people take seriously necessary. major source spike protests attended millions people reopening bars, restaurants, etc. That’s demographic that’s getting hit right 18-34 year olds. also mortality rate low, bc it’s young people getting it. fact NY “Suck Dick” Times refuses acknowledge this, Health officials State New York ALLOWED ask someone tested positive attended protest speaks dishonesty hypocrisy used respected publication world.

Quit fucking lying us tell truth. Quit politicizing virus. I’m sick MSM. tossed integrity trash name click bait political agenda. estimated IFR COVID-19 0.6%, persons Stockholm 
symptom onset around end March, based deaths confirmed cases. 
find clear age-gradient IFR, persons age 70 years older 
46-fold risk dying compared younger 70 years, according 
estimates. Moreover, sizeable share deaths attributed cases 
nursing homes—38.0% deaths estimation sample 41.2% 
total number deaths Sweden 25 May.

0.6% symptomatic people March. Since then, doctors learned treat better. assume estimates 1/3 people never show symptoms correct, puts IFR end March 0.4%, since which, again, knowledge treat patients improved. Considering tuition costs Purdue, would freaking hope so. reason see one largest population international students US university OOS tuition almost 30K per semester compared less 10K instate, want Intl bank. government announcement they’re axing student visas online school, something try keep people enrolled. live Dallas everything shut basis months. genuinely different elsewhere Texas? seems everyone complaining solution frigging pandemic. Surprise surprise. He's rich person, he's really ""from"" anywhere money. Even New York, lived experience 99% New Yorkers can't relate to. wasn’t aware that. It’s insane withholding labor punished harshly. R’s cling don’t “low death rate” anymore? problem we're testing much. stopped testing, new cases.

/s Yes, think correct.

Imagine this, visit nursing home presymptomatic flu (which yes, contagious then). hug grandma, give flu, dies. wearing mask. charged premeditated murder.

Charging people murder wearing masks fucking idiocy.

Edit: want make clear I'm well aware masks work, leave house without one, think people wear masks absolute fucking morons Don’t worry - speakers going tele-video safely attendees watch... going touch face, honestly think asking much face mask. Lincoln Project's America, fucked yeah. literally paid property taxes three weeks ago so. No. Source: also homeowner. area, either pay July December pay year. pay every year July (well, late June ahead July deadline). condo. house's taxes due quarterly (but they're paid escrow, included mortgage).

I aware foreclosure process. still responding real issue - may bodily thrown street day missing payment, LOT people going lose homes. huge problem. Time get rid cancer Facebook! time would disagreed you’re 100% correct. lost close friend love one disease.

I wish worked US whine ""Grandma die Covid. lie boost Covid numbers!""

Like what!?! Who'd benefit conspiracy theory like that??? one wants everything closed! Died hill, huh? Schools offer sports offer football? Title 9 all?  Look per capital deaths, much worse USA,they 10 million people, USA 330 million. Also Swedish friends social distancing etc, seems government letting people lot rather law. don’t blame them, whole pandemic make things even worse teachers already are. show get behind Lies, Try teach kindergarten ""socially distanced"" kids can't button pants, tie shoes. reality September. people infect. swear god people fine “darwinism” don’t think bodies wake. [While 80% deaths electronically processed coded NCHS within minutes, deaths COVID-19 must coded person, takes average 7 add... CO2 actually crucial body ,we wouldnt able use oxygen blood cells CO2

i highly doubt masl leads higher co2 intake hypotheticaly case,i would gladly wear mask Wow brag heard something similar work, ""anyone believes fake virus wants take time work sit around watching tv day nothing""... management. ""When people pray, God always born.... able change eternity. god... you."" quite news headlines today...but whatever reason feels like Sunday discussion seems super slow compared past week least .anyone clue why? Maybe they'll realize none shit matters all. humiliation would worst possible outcome mind. win win everyone! Deaths doubled state three weeks ago. Apparently happening seems like media doesn’t want address it. it’s death rate it’s young ppl getting it. stories seeing young people get seriously ill impacting recovery side. stories need start appear front center. Otherwise going keep yo yo thing every 3-4 months That's almost half world population! Maybe time virus goes meet president.

I hope US get hell soon! No. Yes! Almost asian people Chinatown wearing masks February. Brilliant! Everybody else....not much. thought going case though. Like thought read everyone comes bubble quarantined tested beforehand (which one issues players - spending significant time away family), going direct contact NBA people bubble staff. also cause kidney damage intravenous form.

This cut Classic. lifeguard currently combat idiot moms telling kids safe can’t get it, don’t need socially distance/wear mask. knew wrong, hate hearing bad could them. Stay tuned Genocide murder commanded god multiple times Old Testament Many buildings cannot support socially distancing 30+ kids. Elementary rooms big enough. Consider space, supplies, necessary cleaning processes. video format? write damn paragraph. Livin' ~~dream~~ nightmare 😎 People downvoting right seen thing happen districts near Correction : ""Scientists discover brain damage caused wave COVID."" here. terrifying. People playing pretend isnt literal pandemic going on. see maybe 1/5 people wearing masks despite mandated state. dont get it. people dropping streets denialists get it. Yeah.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* TBF America needs 50k dead surpass Italy deaths per million population. France, Sweden, Italy, Spain, UK, Belgium surpass US deaths per capita. Belgium worst all, would require almost 300k US deaths match amount population dying. touch you, beat ever loving dog shit them.

Free advice: that. De-escalate; let overgrown child throw fit get away situation best can. *Especially* state like Florida coward laws.

This guy yelling ""I feel threatened!"" flippantly, consciously setting ""stand ground"" defense pulling gun killing person angry at.

Edit: basically George Zimmerman case. Zimmerman stalked accosted unarmed young man black (sorry, mean ""looked suspicious"") started getting ass beat shot unarmed man death scared. walked Florida. Italian guy speaking here.

Lombardia region region hit hardest coronavirus. One region 20 totals. region badly hit include Veneto, Liguria, Piemonte, Emilia Romagna. Mainly northern Italy regions hit, could say center southern part italy mostly okay.
This seen perspective though. Lombardia region hosts 1/6 italian population (10 million+). Veneto another 5 million alone. Emilia romagna Piemonte another 5 million each. numbers amount 25 million people, almost half country total population.

That's lot people. reason spread regions everything closed off. People even move among different regions 1 month half.
 
Situations similiar Bergamo showed cities Cremona Lodi, course hospitals could welcome journalist course emergency. lockdown done right way, could've ended many cases like Bergamo. keep finding new exciting groups. also /r/NoNewNormal learned today. rush reopen surprise? could predicted? Exactly, clearly somebody needs hear This, exactly. Trump administration leading country much raping citizens everything short time they're office. Florida. White House listen aligns agenda, that, pretend exist. Critical business travel **shit** US competition.

Freudian slip? I’ve hearing (in several news outlets, including AP) Sweden higher death rate Europe? true? darkest timeline, America. normal circumstances may fine. antibody test. Assumed would positive. wasn’t. dog sick March. really wanted it. son also negative. hoping he’d antibodies college less risk. big works. biggest issue remdisvir intravenous requires support staff. really help got hospital full covid patients beds. Positive cases, hospitalizations deaths trends. news headlines focus positive cases others.

Cases per day Florida 5x hospitalizations per day 10-20%. Maybe lag maybe cases less severe (i.e. younger healthy people), maybe both.  would like help putting context. anyone know estimates made daily cases would represent many hospitalized cases NY NJ CT dealing peak? Oh, mistake. thought talking Tui thing. hate break you, that’s kind get ahead. end day, people want help people like. connection coworkers outside “here’s work k thx,” they’re going super willing help out. It’s difficult form connections you’re working home. 22% bump. ~140% increase.

122 one month Vs 100 two months. congrats you, Italy! already identified fired. won't. US big market. Also critical business travel isn't. I'm sure is, hope never personally find out. Pence others repeatedly said today guidelines, requirements, fine. issue bubble isn’t really isolated, it’s security theater. Unless allowing players visit families interact staff going community time. family friend staid ICT 40 days, he's back home stil needs oxigen time time, probably needs 6 months recovery. easy get big synthoms ended ICT. would anything record numbers surgeries performed late May/ early June?

Has anyone counted new daily new ICU patients surgeries within past 90 days?

That would EXTREMELY important guiding public policy. Last time around, California ""Phase 2"" 45 minutes reopening. It’s true :) Technically illegal lot states. number single dads dwarfed number single moms. exist mean I've ever worked one. hard time even thinking one know. common.

Also, moms tend take responsibility childcare role family, especially relates work. might think two people married kids dad stays home equal amount time regard calling sick, experience working... stay home them, work. I'm like *you also work!* that's business mine. experience, really working hypotheticals, course single dads exist, I've never cover one. 42 year old niece-in-law brother ICU Tennessee praying . Fit fiddle caught COVID went gym reopened. Day 7 ICU ventilator Doctors give fighting chance rate, going need one around Arizona too. Also mandatory masks many places Ontario, help keep things spreading hopefully. thought supposed get app contract tracing too, July 2nd think, I'm sure happened it. Idk Aldi, every country cashiers work lightning speed simultaneously looking bored hell. feel judged can't keep them, rarely can.  (Hank Hill sipping beer)

Yep. we’re supposed spike things get cold again. Mind sharing articles sent them?

I've similar discussions conservative family members Facebook would love good links send them. said anything better general? definitely handling virus better every possible way, literally months warning continue baby steps around waiting magically vanish. 

Unfortunately situations like Murica plan wrong answer. implied comment quoted earth anti-mask area? know thing even exists. would exist? even talking about?

A mask respectable product respectable person, get advertise like everybody else? Oh noes, ever survive. make business personal?

Yes, actually. reason loan officer put mask, want know it. unsavory connections, want put resources take business elsewhere.

This way business works. People held responsible choices. going dumbasses endanger people, get business volunteer contributions people like vulnerable forced shut in. would want support people like that? 5% would much higher 2 million, worst case scenario, assuming talking US population. gotten lungs kidneys checked out? mini clots? argue short term view economics. ones controlled virus well gets restart economy earlier. choosing one option kinda situation.  tracking per capita cases US/Canada around 2.5 3 months. around 3.5. fucked start managed make worse. peak deaths per day around 2500, around 500. Daily deaths still decline since mid-April even recent increases case counts cases found recently FL, AZ, TX simply severe early cases, terms hospitalization fatality. Florida's hospitalization rate still around 5-7%, compared 26% NY. reason probably younger people found virus testing. ICU terrifying. know confirmation bias thing, I've really waiting hear news. beginning heard lot ""well, lived SARS without ever stopping regular activities, worry much"". even heard people health care. Epidemiologists specialists toronto might taken seriously experience SARS think regular people did. idea limit number kids student exposed to, reduce numbers social distance. work...who knows. teachers start getting sick game over. remains seen much risk dogs sniffing humans would be. even is, collect odor samples humans dogs sniff without risk. Thank you, I'm American I'd say guy sure better father far tell responsible gun owner too. hope you’re right hope you’re wrong. confusing. Actually bathe year. Well comforting piece news. breath... politicized nowadays.

Isn't expression ""don't hold breath""?  Americans read, man allowed that? enact strict health guidance protocols get millions sick?

Seems reading this, silver lining might moving lot people early retirements perhaps provide big boost millennial generation opportunities advance careers next 10 years. Someone /r/teachers posted allegedly receiving waiver sign teach next year, sent district school something. basically said acknowledged COVID-19 risk could get sick, permanently injured, die, happened sue.

I idea legit waiver not, got thinking: would students teachers need sign waiver going back in-person school? There's precedent waivers. Trump rallies, people acknowledge risk waive (supposedly) right sue.

I'm wondering public school system would require waiver like that.

...WARNING WALL TEXT...

So [Swedish government's website describe aims strategy bullet list:

• Limit spread infection country
• Ensure health care resources available
• Limit impact critical services
• Alleviate impact people companies
• Ease concern, example providing information
• Ensure right measures taken right time.

That last bullet ofc interesting one since ""the right measures"" ""the right time"" discussion. case would say basically means government leave decision non-political experts FHM (the Public Health Agency).

As see bullet list strategy even include complete eradication virus. FHM, top dog Anders Tegnell, took decision early going impossible Sweden keep virus uncontrollably spreading society. Instead full lock downs proposed lighter measures aimed keep life normal possible large majority people protecting (and restricting) ones virus seemed pose largest threat too. bold move doubt since still know much virus long-term effect. 

But stopping uncontrolled spread deemed impossible, lock-down not. Hence reasoned long limit spread levels health systems still handle increased burden keep people risk isolated possible might well start lighter measures, needed ramp later point.

As know completely going according plan. able protect ones needed protection. However, according early might failure elderly care system strategy. 

Unlike Hospitals, governed regions, elderly care (nursery homes, home care etc.) governed Municipalities. last decades many Municipalities decided let private companies run and/or spend less budget care undeniably led lower salaries, less education caretakers working hours instead steady employment. Many work several homes get enough hours able survive. [This suggests percentage hours worked people hourly contracts number deaths related corona given facility, correlates. example given Stockholms nursing homes, 23% hours worked people hourly contracts hit lot harder Malmö Gothenburg, 10% each. Mortality within Malmö's elderly care [is actually relation last couple years. Stockholm 100%.

FHM blamed severely overstating shape Sweden's elderly care government expressed regrets this. someone particularly risk able live rather normal life (going work, seeing closest circle friends, eating drinking etc.) last couple months. mother immensely rougher time. many basically socially isolated since March. Seeing struggle loneliness, anxiety limited every day life made question tf she, I, would survive full lock-down. I'm really impressed people locked-down countries handled isolation truly hope leave scars deep looking lot brighter though. Deaths cases declining steadily stress healthcare system going down. Testing (also part strategy) finally ramped Stockholm like crazy yesterday got positive result back. low fever really tired week April apparently it. Really crazy virus affect people different ways. evidence doesn’t persist body like herpes? Seems short term evidence far, people within last months. people early testing positive months, maybe reinfections, continuing infections? maybe faulty tests. Point, don’t know. CA MD finding major lung scarring asymptomatic patients, don’t even know extent affecting young, asymptomatic patients aren’t lung xrays hospitalized. damage hidden. vascular disease - risk stroke, cognitive damage, heart damage etc this? son, sick months. test came back negative.  thought antibodies forever. I'd also like point overall ESTIMATE . 4%. cherry picking ESTIMATE certain age group. reiterate, ESTIMATE. God *is* collective. sky daddy makes miracles happen. like word miracle either. dismisses much superstition. need impeach tRump anything. needs something occupy fucking time *kills us all*. Oh hello, /r/Winnipeg still tinnitus firecracker thrown face 1994 Vancouver riots. (I lived west end time). Nah sorry Fox News on. 3% positive, young invincible; not. Sure, even P5 don’t cancel, losing conference going screw schedules short notice, nothing else. Shit. Lived Bergen country entire life. Masks good thing, like u said super dense population already 2nd paycheck type cannot support family teacher's pay. get married someone good salary teacher prepared live poverty line job security able get tenure that's even offered anymore. 

Where live, year find hired year tenure. went back school got degree hoping teach high school salary would less got administrative assistant school plus would get master's done post-graduate teaching program. Said fuck got job making $70k+ year bachelor's. 

I see lot teachers retiring quitting. school districts gonna do? hard time hiring teachers even coronavirus. gonna good time folks school age kids. Everything absolutely insane.

At point, revolution starting sound like justified self-defense. still wear mask go necessary. Friday ""shopping day."" get groceries check vinyl section Goodwill. walk dog secluded areas. part. desperate see end. desperate reopen. desperation pushing day we’ll able reopen safely back further.

The Republican Party deserves destroyed this. see NFL taking NBA like approach terms continuing season. eyes shown ears fed nothing fake rainbows sunshine shoved asses. god damn jedi mind trick.

Clearly, nothing see here. summer going shitshow name Kevan, exempt impending meme?

I wear face mask whenever I'm indoor public places can't keep distance please group Kevins. 🙏  giant Petri dishes started, children gross. Used worst you’d get cold stomach bug, straight die...

Children gross largely reflection families gross. huddled 30 adults room based home location kid activities, they'd equally gross. Idaho mask requirement Boise city limits, others follow, likely Ada county next. mountain towns like Sun Valley area hit early also mandating. Woah. 

What hell went wrong? King County liberal.

As close 100% ever see US. Well used people dying polio, measles, smallpox, ""controversial"" vaccines arrived.. Pretty wild people can't learn recent events vaccines help save lot children's lives.  Southpark sure get ""grand adventure"" dislike distance learning kids parents know agree.

It however open lot options especially older kids like high school. take classes high school, regional, otherwise, colleges.

We parents frustrated by, example, foreign language choice offered local school. Well take class another school.

It easy imagine world pandemic kids option taking classes online, potentially schools. benefits think kept.

I attended Q&amp;A high school principal last night talked balancing needs students teachers. actually become easier look entire school district even larger area, example 2 3 kids school can't justify full time teacher position, one teacher county could teach kids. That's shame. almost hard believe but, again, look across country including current President ... maybe hard believe. can't fix stupid think raise people strong leader provides proper guidance crises. none right now. trying get fall logic trap losing thread? directly ties people wearing masks, protesters, people shitty trigger discipline average joe. Move along, cult member, move along. fucking contest. ""But look countries. worse us!"" someone else point mean America fucked situation terrible. 

What makes worse benefit forewarning everything going EU still neglected act.  hint: safe theres vaccine. kids school FULLY vaccinated. Online option then. Fuck me, didn’t realize bad getting Israel. Every state right-wing loon fucking failed.  spend much time fearing flu?

I sure shit want flu, all. cold, strep throat, things get passed around.

But IFR roughly 2.6x flu, right still learning disease vaccine (the flu would kill lot people knew less vaccine), worth washing hands, wearing masks indoors, maybe hugging grandparents, fearing one statistically die intubated worth worry IMO. people different risk tolerances, ylu. Deaths peak couple weeks cases. US cases started going 2 weeks ago. little uptick start. See shape cases chart? That’s what’s going happen shape deaths chart. First peak cases circa 35k/day, deaths 2.2k so. Currently heading 60k/day cases expect deaths rise 4K/day. Trouble second peak end - really showing much sign reimposing lockdown, could get lot worse gets better. doctors sending warning: virus care old healthy are.

I'm 35 staying safe possible, isnt really true actually glosses deadly old people.

In state, CFR 40 less 0.08%. 81+, almost 27%.

Find another disease people 80 300x likely die people 40. dont know exists.

This deadly young people, practically grim reaper old people. Oh scroll bit. I'm getting . 26ed reporting hospital data. Anytime guy thinks spending money everything suddenly extreme. first cancel spring sports February. colleges definitely going follow protocol idiot chief threatens punish states *not* throwing CDC recommendations tries force schools open recklessly carelessly... it’s time retire. super fast 10 years later let go cars lol. Sure dying cheap though! Wtf probably backlogged deaths, happens much ""gg"" mean theres stopping it, seems right. There's already massive shortage teachers since pay low.

They import teachers Philippines. country thinks 32k starting salary someone essentially master's degree (teaching credential degree) good deal. single person's older brother campus friend roomate comes party. interacts single student. Storgasm *Cases Nordic country declined sharply past days Tuesday 283 new cases recorded.*

*That contrasts torrid month June daily numbers ran high 1,800, eclipsing rates across much Europe, even deaths hospitalisations continued decline peaks April.* Everyone geniuses do. anyone else get multiple emails vote petitions reopen churches get classified essential? unpatriotic recognize problems country disappointed takes turn believe wrong. Blind patriotism true patriotism all. Fake news. General-striking support striking medical workers would nice. like forecasting hundreds thousands burgers sold McDonalds. Yeah it’s kinda likely. People hasnt respected virus also 
So might equally fucked want drag forever constitution? Please dont hurdur ""rights"". potential successfully protects semester outbreak 0%. Riiiight. adding probable cases (which increases exponentially, basically includes anyone live with, interacts positive case regularly) caused count rise much faster. LOL listen post? Okay, I'll try.

You know talking about.

Boom. one listen. Thank well wishes. 
I'm Florida see maskless people people complaining making scene pretty often. 

Really first started attempting contact tracing heard anyone even telling anyone. sounds like get diagnosed coronavirus near number one goal keep secret... sucks... toured pilgrims pride slaughterhouse. year took tour think 2016 2017 mentioned plant 100% turn over. Hired 1,600 workers 1,600 people quit year. hire people literally nowhere go. Canada accepted Syrian refugees Canadians ran people work slaughterhouses.  mean, it’s Ivy League. B10 cancels... Exactly. 

So, routinely test sort thing procedures deemed bleeding risks. we're finding COVID extremely weird. shit link pure spam site Eh? say that? saying kids aren’t affected badly. there’s plenty adults be. There’s 3.6 million teachers USA. doesn’t include support staff. One local school districts looking half days getting rid specials (core 4 person only), go home lunch. 

Online play others useless. Don’t let videos see online fool you. It’s super expensive equipment mass amounts editing try make look like playing singing together.

Heard sending Colorado River Yuma Arizona use. /S ""something special air"" Haunted Mansion possibly worst ride Disneyland.  best Space Mountain Ghost Galaxy overlay. huge problem moderating non-English facebook sites. Enough bot reporting shuts people sites nothing wrong, sites promoting dangerous BS hate stay up.   China related questions, early detection extreme reaction due fact china hit SARS 2003. SARS lot deadly covid displayed similar symptoms SARS early days. fact 8 doctors CCP detained cover early outbreak saying SARS based observations hospitals Wuhan. SARS, Beijing one hardest hit city build mobile hospitals already.

China experience thousands outbreaks cities. sure said much outbreak. Also interesting time period Wuhan outbreak happens, Chinese New Year. numbers would think people travel 2 months new year. get long holiday new year that's people go back hometown. China lockdown everything right new year people trapped Wuhan go home. US population start Civil War 1860 31.4 million. least 618,000 people died conflict (perhaps many 750k), approximately 2% population.

By contrast, US population 1940 census, prior WW II, 132 million, 420,000 people died, 0.33% population.

Our current population 330M. suffer death trauma percent population comparable World War II, would 1,089,000 dead. comparable Civil War, would 6,600,000.

Current ""official"" death figures COVID 0.04% population. actual death figure 28% higher, would make 0.05% population. one dead every two thousand people.

By contrast, WWII dead one every three hundred people; Civil War dead one every fifty.

So hold breath! doubt truly meaningful change grass-roots societal level happen least million dead. agreeing him. agree kids school. SAFELY! plan whatsoever open schools safely proceeding anyway. We're stupidly still open. I'm essential employee, servicing pharma lab equipment - need lock back absolutely insane.

Everyday job customers calling tell one employees contracted Covid. Yes. one understands never feel rested regardless much sleep. Yeah agree. better education less Karens Male Karens (kens, frank, jeremey?) I’m thinking bigger stores use carrot approach.

They employee wander store, handing $10 gift cards shoppers wear masks wear correctly.

The task rotate among employees everyone gets turn gift certificate fairy. german (corona-warn-app italian (immuni apps live available respective app-/play-stores I’m San Diego literally every single store I’ve including retail stores require masks everyone wears one. also less people California alone... get 😂 Jesus participating cabinet meeting Absolutely! numbers coming National Multifamily Housing Council, group tracking rent payments similar manner ourselves. difference findings reflection different samples we're surveying.

NMHC aggregating data professionally-managed, multifamily apartment communities, represents portion nation's renter population. According census bureau, 42% renters live single-family homes; renters would left NMHC sample. capture broader set renters living types housing: multi-family, also homes owned mom-and-pop landlords.

I think payment rates lower. actually break results rates building type, sure enough, payment rates highest renters large multi-family buildings. Why, exactly, concrete data on. simple answer could renters wealthier average, making easier take on-time payments (but that's speculation point). scary thing exponential growth growth lol. Deaths still trending downwards, even weeks ""surge"" y'all see turning? many weeks? 2? 6? Pick number. We'll see.  can't teach elementary school kids online. last 3 months nightmare son. I’m getting data CDC. mother law sounds like nice lady, I’ll trust CDC info. good night! Stay safe! Tim Hortons always trying tie Canada's national identity, even Canadian owned anymore. indeed gone complete shit. quality absolute garbage now.  sometimes would bet friend drinking problem. sides bad vote republican.

Dumb conspiracy theories keeping government able actual something this.  guy works 3-year-old 9-month-old, he's observed thing since 3-year-old going preschool. said, non-pandemic times mind you, immune building activity send petri dish environments?

I still find frustrating. uncle thing recovered Covid-19. credit god, blame China Liberals. People won’t take seriously bodies streets. Let happen. don’t care anymore. much freezer trucks full dead bodies NYC.

Its interesting google search ""NYC morgue trucks"" find pictures seeing back March.

I would think common, curious New Yorkers would taken footage them. balconies, workplaces near hospitals, even curious maintenance staff stuff.

But seems since early photos scared everybody much, werent lot sightings morgue trucks. Italian here.
My cousin doctor hospital.
During peak February March listening crying hours end shift.
Too many lives lost.
Now over.
How?

Please . Please.
1. Wear mask
2. Social distancing 
3. Wash hands.

That’s it.  FB. Good ole email forwarding still works, least Central Europe among boomers. detailed breakdowns? majority younger patients comorbid things like obesity, diabetes, asthma etc? know factors like diet, vitamin/mineral deficiencies etc? know 20s tests would probably normal healthy. 

I'm really curious we're point suggest preventive measures. know vitamin popular one Joe Rogan enough evidence things? music teacher (college privately), also concerning. multitude studies coming next several weeks denoting exactly much spread caused wind brass instruments, later voice speech/debate. 

Preliminary results encouraging, much aerosols might think. They’re also looking happens empty spit valve, beat clean instrument, sanitize chairs, stands etc. I’m trying remain optimistic!

P.S. - professional trombonist, teaching lots lessons Zoom. DM son wants private lessons! ""Hey, 500,000 people die cancer heart disease every year shut casinos gyms that."" damn shame. Ignore dollar numbers sec, taking many people valuable skills training experience wisdom etc saying it’s needed. economist would call human capital. real source collective society wealth, many people know everything could want. left find something else do. question was, cloth masks effective? answer yes.

No, that's question. Offering people something hypothetically circumstances useful, answer life-threatening situation. People want clarity circumstances. 

There's reason lot scientists come forward demanding attention fact virus obviously airborne carried droplets sneezing coughing. asymptomatic transmission cases significant. 

It's personal opinion FDA approve casual public use respiratory infection protection lightweight, easier cheaper manufacture [KN95 style masks able buy $1 would hope US able mass-produce can't pull mass-producing enough N95 masks. none happening.

The lightweight KN95 style masks uncomfortable people used wearing them. They're better protection cloth indoors around someone coronavirus infection. I've using they're super effective filtering fine floating invisible carbon particles filtered cloth well. 

The next best thing surgical-style masks, non-woven fiber filter well enough even fit great around sides face. There's reason we're unable manufacture practically hand out, dirt cheap, kinds masks 6 months epidemic US. 

The kind masks Fauci's showing demonstrating even nose pieces air circulate around people's noses even get filtered. think part make sense lot people think big joke. many alternative stories everything related coronavirus one knows believe anymore. That's good situation people losing jobs, running money situation going change months/years. ITT, people middle pandemic numerous stories disease mutating, think diseases static never mutated.

Every day, every day, hit limit dealing ignorance stupidity reddit.

Learn something. that's syphilis first definitely recorded Europe 1495, pustules often covered body head knees, caused flesh fall people's faces, led death within months."" disease much lethal get photos hospital sheets mother law receives every week counts ICU patients tells ages. Every week since started good amount ICU patients 20s 30s. I'll believe hospital data I've seen Reddit stranger. whatever makes feel better man. Yeah you’re bringing retirement community. That’s key component sequence described. 

Spinal meningitis outbreaks going seem rather quaint fall semester.

And here’s kicker. point trump save us. trump convince merry band lunatics put masks. removed office, forced out, voted out, voted forced etc followers never ever going masks. Biden gets make executive decree mandating mask wearing national level. never maskers going go beserk trump politicized option it’ll large part wasn’t re-elected. 30% country won’t they’ll keep active. 

TLDR trump dug hole one shovel. make call TX gov? That's lot us enjoyed much ""shame nose outside mask"" :) ""There 11,694 new COVID-19-positive patients reported California yesterday, Newsom said — though number includes backlog reported laboratories Los Angeles County. Removing L.A., state's positives would 10,000 yesterday.""

They counting backlogged cases. allocated proper day. 1000x safer going restaurant. Much closer 1-2 days 7. Ouch! That’s sounds hard teeth! sounds challenging. wife PK/K teacher 10+ years familiar this. used come every cold going around school started fall. referred classroom petri dish.

Many daycares still open around country been, quite understand.

However also students ages. kids high school problem social distancing learning online. Middle schoolers generally same, expected misbehavior.

In conversation teachers students remember kids ages, little kids. absolutely halt domestic travel states, whether air, train automobile. I'm Chicago area tried best New York sadly feel efforts vain. rich stupid keep riching stupiding best batten hatches. thought done feels poignant now; Winter Coming. based mobility persons installed app, reflects requests directions Apple Maps. guessing people use Apple Maps Denmark. 

Do better data shows Denmark locked longer harder US? Schools opened back April, US fighting tooth nail go back September. office still isn’t back, Danish counterparts office 100 percent capacity without masks since Mid May.

Apple Maps track data coughing. data suggests cough less? would argue cough every time say Rød grød med fløde, hey, concede bit grey area.

They know foot, car bus yes, based type directions select. convention center needed hospital soon.  Face mask others. Hand washing protection. 

Still prob shouldn’t touch face.

Edit: ok ok mask MOSTLY prevent spread others. Well, ya. Classrooms deathtraps. ever Italy?! Breaking news: water wet. Freedom killed football. Americans seeing this: can’t like this

Also Americans: continues go overcrowded beaches I’m right. You’re coward.jus Yes, it’s even worse that. 14 cases USA, Trump opportunity STOP people virus entering country, start taking serious precautions stop spread. refused, grounds hoax, people’s minds, political ploy, etc. 
NOTHING STOP VIRUS TAKE PRECAUTIONS, 14 cases. 100,000 PEOPLE DEAD.  hold personally responsible number, every person dies number passed! smell like perfume factory far likely vaccine deployed would christmas break, next summer latest. one would far behind, even matter days. sure know this, school effing awful days, there's accountability students learn ipad games videos day long.

Not ever phenomenal, always babysitter, sympathy parents, especially single parents, supposed do? good answer, schools definitely need stay closed right now.  Exactly. I’ve seen several comparisons group project select actually work. plane. Yeah, yikes. would worry too. making fun Trudeau all. Pointing statement simple obvious truth. wish ""leader"" like Trudeau. Congrats guys built servers downloaded apps. Yes is. imagine ICU every 24 hours, someone might come kick room someone scored lower triage evaluation you. That's thing. 
 
Is online school less effective? 
 
Yes. 
 
Is caretaker die detrimental students GPA? 
 
Also, yes. school districts next county said students 5 days week. Masks optional mention social distancing smaller class sizes(how 5 days week). changes busing 2 kids per seat little 3.

I thought since flattened curve summer, we'd little break. looks like thing spreads time let foot brake.

This actually good news second wave kicks ass would really even worse think. thing seems basically forest fire. strike match kindling many, many times anything really catches fire. does, hard control. think that's here. gonna keep pumping brakes we're going get natural waves beginning. man-made decreases while. long nonessential businesses stay open people keep refusing social distance wear masks, rates keep going up. stopping time soon unless drastic measures taken. 9500 one day california would put money Go Fund change ""It's Small World"" lyrics ""It's flu all"".  Last time there, boats broke stuck like 20 minutes listening awful song. false claims coming Russia since March. Apparently, even tried spread washing hands matter anything. 

I live ex-communist country. mom recently received email former classmate (who worked Czechoslovakia's version KGB) inhaling water vapors baking soda totally kills virus doctors it. sent lots inflammatory political BS before... seems top though. mean long breaks even- don’t pay additional taxes “income” isn’t any. least would stop losing property.

I dunno people actually live income though. Seriously, anybody thinks Mexico okay paying slightest bit attention Mexican news. really upsetting too. :( They're neighbors, even Texas, Mexican news hardly gets mainstream coverage. think western countries value individual pretty highly. Americans simply unable consider group all. Duce wins! haha, love governor !!! Keep going NYT article aggregating 7 day moving average across every state country unfortunately, AAP dismissed dangers posed teachers &amp; staff considering re-opening. head AAP Today Show another news mag basically skirted issue teacher safety question posed, saying schools need take appropriate measures. virus airborne enclosed space! preventative measures cash-strapped districts really take? can't outfit faculty &amp; staff N95's face shields. go closest park place walk, closest mammal deer 200 feet away. mask ?

wow... meant both. masks can't protect you, can't protect others. subreddit can't figure woven cloth masks protective, part medical ignorance problem country people even think intellectual authority figures say, blindly believe.

But said this? Lol, I'm even sure I'm responding you, keep responding ideas one else brought except ... you. look like arguing comments compared side side.

Considering that, literally done absolutely nothing let medical experts take charge instead calling hoax created opposition, doubled politicizing whole thing things turned sour, things would actually LEAST somewhat better, personally believe that, much actually dislike Hillary, partially rotten overcooked potato would handled things better, pandemic wise, current POTUS. actually good young teachers Everyone keeps saying that, I’m going hold (probably false) hope we’ll wearing masks. Nah,

They going expect states wrong team going take hardline stance guidelines cut funding. way team more. He's wearing mask now? school year

A lot things go right *only* next school year. many things go wrong next 2-3 years.

Not pessimistic let's keep mind many curve balls year thrown assume we're going knock park. country world confirmed coronavirus cases growing rapidly Arizona, Florida South Carolina.

Only Kyrgyzstan, Costa Rica, West Bank Gaza faster growth rate least 5,000 cases.

Also, Idaho, country, but... forget Idaho, lol. think places it’s lack supplies lab capacity. Emperor protects You’d surprised many certified teachers waiting job openings. area plenty. It’s highly competitive market. took position mid-year 150 candidates. traditional job searching times (spring, summer) could easily doubled. It’s % people hospitalized, % cases. teachers union brainwashed people think teachers lives well matter. Here, friend mine pissed banning ball game sports school reopens 2 months. Smh, thinks pair mask gloves cna prevent completely contracting it, situation bump someone easily, walk back heavily air conditioned room Right, it’s great PR though! depends take take care kids safe way. requires attention, leadership, probably money. money machine cooled ready go BRRRR again. Okay cool. protests 1000s people top other? keep shutting due staff getting sick showing up. force want, won’t actually work. least hotspot area. deal here. Something keep mind, people saying antibody tests come back negative 2 months, even before. Mine negative well, sick Flu/Pneumonia/COVID type symptoms Dec-Mar pretty much non stop. work country club. Enforcing literally impossible. people pay 200k join, additional thousand month told wear mask pool/in pro shops. Luckily don’t interact much them, since help :) don’t think people good anymore. majority people entitled self involved. also work place “attempt” enforce face masks. big punning ""amen"" that.  fact, let's define irony, people want ""let run course"" ""deniers"" US also tend Christian Fundamentalists. Soooooo.....God's would fill country disease, let run free, that's think. wish Italy. Thank Dr Obvious. course higher. data total deaths US increase last year much higher amount COVID deaths reported Thank look that. might vain dont think immunity confirmed worth peace mind. Thanks looking up. Thankfully, actually is. Fatality proven effective 100% time! looks really good comparison. wish leaders acceptable job. RiOteRs??!!1! got deleted word nothing else obvious, probably banned word aware of. know happened NJ? posted lot fatalities. Half joking really....I think Target going mandate masks, make separate lines people masks. Yup, 10mil 12mil short space time. there's immunity getting naturally there's one vaccine either. That's estimate hotly debated experts scientists. believe estimated either . 6 . 8%, can't remember. 

Wherever IFR falls, zero bearing said. Numbers lie, lot younger people ending ICUs even necessarily die. italian blood! do!

Plague spread Churches like wildfire middle ages similar reasons. Sad thing today though moderns benefit medical science, germ theory disease, ability get control, folks magical thinking knew better right?

Contact tracing wont even work now, country passed timetables mitigation containment. stupid arrogant among us guaranteed win horrible prize. CDC keeps updated (with little lag), latest numbers show 160,000 excess deaths average now, couple weeks ago. think Cornell's paper? figure around 20-30 hospitalizations open, 70-80 -- 70-80 spread around nation.

This going away anytime soon. never thought Covid, daughter said. 

I find surprising. 3+ months news saturation, lockdown etc, time anyone feels remotely unwell first thought Covid. Specially since known range symptoms broad. 

I'm Australia low numbers. Surely US, hugest numbers would forefront people's minds? buddy 20 years medical field, master's degree. worked country. says wear mask.  I'll go 5 best rides America  surprised mask usage US 71% Canada 58%, UK 31%, Australia 21%, Denmark, Norway Sweden around 3%?

I'll honest. surprised. Cases climbing hospitalizations ICUs steady. Perhaps that’s reason? get them. stay away get alive. able yell loud anymore permanent lung damage mostly asymptomatic case COVID. Raising “mission accomplished” banner letting things get back normal soon seems good way cause another wave virus. actually true! swear god story spread like wildfire across Canada, assure 100% said, McD’s coffee still better Tim’s. means 15% Covid patients age 45 hospital.

(Sorry worldometer still loading, site might answer questions, I’m curious interpretation is) Nietzche dead.

-God seem good enough contact tracing system allows us stamp new outbreaks. Kingston went weeks without new cases outbreak 40 people.

But seemed controlled outbreak three days row without new cases. guesses dude voted for? president United States literally said 99% people catch fine. also officials calling didn’t wear masks violated quarantine. 

People underestimate negative effect lack united leadership here. used words ""most"" ""all"". Maybe need learn English well anger management. Confederate? Agreed.  Individual states control outbreaks cases, wearing masks reduce fatalities somewhat re-flattening curve, already gone far stop. Hahahaha sane one six months prepare moment. It’s ludicrous infuriating can’t believe live timeline. going away. put camp skeptical states going see death numbers you(and media) predicting.

Are aware 130k people already died u.s. right? saying somehow even number infected people skyrocketing deaths magically stay down? financial hardships real lot people, many people country live paycheck paycheck can't afford gap pay weeks much less months. cause problems, debt, losing house, lack food, health care, necessities. Many people already chosen go back work even risk getting virus staying home working probably worse them. anyone idea lag NY hitting ICUs long took deaths begin hit well after? allegations absolutely false based upon **irresponsible speculation inaccurate information**,” church statement reads.

But does? sound confused. Question: work upstairs office building shaped like house. one floor stairs open. whole building HVAC, air pretty stagnant.

Nobody really knew, becoming apparent thing way worse originally thought. case like that, erring ""conservative side"" could cause deaths, logic solution is, within reason everything can, use everything can. wrong now, least kill anyone. 

""Let's over-react"".........but nobody knew right appropriate reaction was, fact. Pretty strange logic. Yeah don’t even noble get statue People really would sacrifice quarter million Americans means keep “freedoms”. Oh don’t take loved ones though. Pathetic. y'all see treat infected Russia?

Floridian originally New Yorker, ironically, makes Florida! Yeah, Canadian city (of 800,000) zero new cases 8 days now, 325 since started, 7 deaths.

 closest American city Fargo, one sixth population: **they've 3500 cases, 66 deaths**. 

I know premier (who right wing) adhered closely federal leadership guidelines national provincial medical expertise. Pretty much everything apart groceries, drug stores, etc. shut early. Things like masks never political issue here, exception handful Q-Anon idiots, caught way America.

I've worn mask every time I've left house since March, lot people aren't. suspect major difference one public policy. happens people care collective rather individual. GO ITALY!! freaking it. That’s even taking count people like mom trying recover like six months answers. They’re common think. she’s 50.  Heck job Brownie governors need come say well. sucks national plan March could likly opened schools soon. not, even though testing way better still enough capacity targeted testing would needed schools open already conducting tests literally every country (disregarding China’s fake claims), yeah definition that’s best anybody do. done? elections rigged one wants go harsher solution. keep reminding make November. back mind, fear creeps in: could likely see Trump re-elected. what? completely ignored social distancing. BWAHAHAHA even care open? think US getting started? Canada currently infection rate 2,828 per 1,000,000 people. US overall rate 9,474 per 1,000,000.

The northern half US states mixed bag. Maine (2,574), Vermont (2,013), Montana (1,283) rates good better Canada. However, states aren’t densely populated like New Hampshire (4,363), North Dakota (5,211), Idaho (4,778), significantly cases per capita Canada.

After that, it’s pretty much downhill States. Michigan (7,465), Rhode Island (16,240), Illinois (11,881), Massachusetts (16,047) prime examples. VA holding together :( holding steady bc decline NoVa hiding incline Hampton Roads.

Excuse ignorance, much discussion table moment virus mutating? 2 weeks ago tested positive virus Sweden, partner different symptoms ""norm"" usually characterised. loss taste smell, bit headache sore joints/muscles. Whilst know new news, I'm starting think virus may could mutated, several people know also symptoms coughing respiratory issues.

My thinking end day, virus's goal continue life cycle, infect host A, spread host B etc. host dies, virus fails spread must adapt/mutate order spread. missing something here?

I would love know possibility, I'm incredibly ignorant viruses, please share! think early term stuck, construct based influenza, truly seasonal. think terminology harmful like many ideas, hard remove. could wrong could get absolutely destroyed fall, think instead see rises cases related restaurant bar spending, private gatherings, low mask compliance. 

I say virus seems work waves, interrupt wave lot, spread would naturally. might something see, first wave completely allowed happen. account'll still around.

RemindMe! 6 weeks Fuckin ruthless. approve methods. ""whispers"" ad fave far.

Edit: you’re part solution, you’re part precipitate. wrong about? still debate? Wth. Kinda feels like we're playing russian roulette days. wanted teacher, graduated started substitute teaching January. 

Not anymore though, right mind would go classroom time? ESPECIALLY substitute teacher sick, seem like brightest idea guess want teacher anymore.

Plus school districts proving like administration, profits lives passionate loyal employees. Good. probably old burn-outs usually pay leave.  Reality sets in. correct. Taiwan Hong Kong asking friend. isn’t act threatening take away something don’t comply demands extortion? Maybe god's sending message: ""Don't dumbass"" Mexico issue migrant cards us? consolation, birds stop using nests naturally babies fledged. (Post photo /r/whatsthisbird they'll able tell kind bird is.) problem, yes. instead blaming AAP, blame people misconstrued twisted advice recommendations. Could AAP thoughtful statements? Certainly. bulk blame placed door using recommendations political gamesmanship. small percentage would cover entire US Shit, Justin. friend tell hospitals get money government Covid deaths, many hospitals weren’t ICU centers rather isolation centers practice. I’ve come believe chinese success containing virus based quarantining sick **as well potentially exposed** (even forcibly) separate centers, away general population. Maybe “Nearer Thy God Thee” song playing background walk podium. seem pretty bitter. Everything ok? spend time developing world see much local elites tend fucking over. it’s fun externalize things point foreign meddling, doubt. Something got wrong water early say beat virus virologists foreseeing second wave autumn. Anyway Italy Italians done good job far. think ever stopped honest. timely access courts cut ways. example, landlord decides illegally shut utilities, (legal) recourse get judge put stop it.

If sides decide courts longer relevant, imagine things get weird quickly. friend Florida(shocker) sent/flew son two week camp couple weeks ago. pandemic. son 4. camp remember 4? kid will. remember parents sent/flew two week camp, pandemic that's it. mayor tests positive. Well, right. Masks don’t protect Covid. protect others. everyone wore mask, everyone would protected. issue would require actually care people. lazy bums $1200 got Trump April? Florida would follow suit cancel RNC convention. SIIIIIIII LO LOGRARON!!!, They've 60 years heavy propoganda imbedded culture, skipping conventional nothing. Man really completely unprepared thing knew going happen eventually huh? never pandemic like would happen again, when! deal. lots poultry plants Gainesville Georgia lot workers Latino. undocumented (don't numbers) even feel bad go doctor fear deported. fact show shifts work that's culture need job. caused case count GA reported put families risk proxy others community. (Not blaming them, system work for) time set aside differences come together humans deal pandemic instead waiting called leaders something. shit. really. Antibodies come play first lines defense fail. AKA bad enough actually get sick. vaccines tricky need deliver enough fake/dead virus body trigger antibody response, without causing body actually get sick try think needs work hard rid body it. Plus risk actually trick body make antibodies trick enough i.e. body think big enough deal keep antibodies around month, making vaccine effectively useless. new excuse think next week

Hahaha laughing stock exactly ""safe"" reopen schools?

Frankly, opponent party decry oppositions decision early/too late. fact matter nobody knows safe even data pandemic going half year, nearly enough making sweeping declarations may may safe reopen. people don’t believe things government tells see eyes. ironic, lot claim Christians base entire existence something can’t see. people full hate empathetically bankrupt? Oh god don’t give anyone ideas I've read case happy them...high schools 3,000-4,000 teenagers together 8 hours day, 5 days week world difference small groups daycare age kids Y. chance working. hundreds. many good reason shit guy, business success rate ludicrously high, hence ""business man"" image.

I'd imagine reasons rate high would paint negative picture him, rate doesn't. know what, suit, would same. think people coughing sneezing cold R(t) virus definitely rise. Haha - could be. certainly pack cities transportation closely. Shibuya crossing Tokyo famous crowdedness looks like worst possible thing could exist pandemic. Masks probably help. Americans individualistic, themselves. US young, ethnocentric place. Italy much older place, thousands years history mostly tight knit, proud culture; tend keep check.

Don’t worry Kenneth Copeland come save True, true... spite recent spike, feel quite lucky San Jose, California opposed one states denial like Georgia from.


Hope y'all stay safe well. idea you’re asking live Kentucky guess wait another week wrong. They're letting enter hospital Unless u're absolutely dying Remember y'all protested lift lockdown lift quarantine... y'all want lock again... what? They’re afraid deep state manipulated literal government (yes behalf another government still). Unfortunately lot mixed messages unknown. Federal leadership, case local leadership, proven impotent handling it.

I feel sorry people mis-informed lied refuse wear mask. going kill people stunt economy even longer. Thanks heads up. Copied wrong link fixed it. Religion causes nothing problems.

Religion cancer burrows deep mind heart. leads division. social media, internet ONE PARTICULAR ANNOYING ORANGE. incorrect. US 122k excess deaths May 23.  restaurants still almost full. going keep going like free claim? running healthcare looks like, call doctor tell stay away unless feel like actively dying, people dye get chance call.

Same thing happened NY, Lombardy, etc. thing happen TX, AZ, FL, SoCal. fair question.... answered Victorian Chamber Commerce predicts six-week lockdown spell end businesses go back blaming China Step 1: Want attention causing commotion wearing mask.

However, created mother would call horns dilemma. virus care really want go protest. I'm either intellectually honest pandemic, I'm making excuses I'm I'm better anyone else. Suffice say, although still bothers me, go protests. get ways. That's feel subject churches reopening. guess job also felt threatened average person reddit able predict - deaths lagging indicator, goes testing cases hospitalizations finally deaths. idiots driven MAGA agenda got wrong lmao.. oh no, they're going scream great leader 45 follow literal graves...

they know leadership means. Dow 30,000?

Unemployment 20%?

Certainly Coronavirus statistics..... girl works school district development buildings stuff, department absolutely bonkers thinking build social distancing classrooms. actually met *children*? seniority structure defended vigorously unions. would hard replace. We're talking CA right? take bet.

Not saying wrong.. think timeline wrong. Also we've learned enough help patients recover faster death rate never pick create dooms day scenario. Still scary road ahead nonetheless. Oh ok guess they’ll die then. need pay extra attention now! easy fall black hole called covid. say normal life routines outside home always wear mask. Today gym like: touch anything sanitize it. meet family it’s pretty ok low level attention always wear mask meet close friend people outside family. South Carolina (2,300

yup

and governor's big COVID safety initiative weeks ago literally STICKER restaurants could put doors show VOLUNTARILY part DHEC program says they're....in accordance COVID safety guidelines. 4th july weekend = closed testing centers closed labs. He's even smart enough even understand said him

Italy may history Catholicism small percentage attend church majority don’t even get married church. “I wore suit you”-Vincent Gambini Good point, important remember disinfo one way street, operation infektion (although doubt called anymore) whole system one demographic. Florida Texas right now? Also deaths spike again, trump fucked hard. Sadly incredibly hard unless willing go debt take years get degree in-demand field another country. even guarantee. I'd love move NZ/the UK/Canada hard. rant stay wherever goes. Companies background checks time hiring people. rant blackballed himself. Even companies care wearing masks want crazy person working them. religious establishments known beacons advanced discoveries medical science humanity ever seen /s looked yeah compared 7 day average Germany, lot US states worse despite less population. 

Also Tblisi Georgia better Atlanta Georgia. testing bout drop zero.

mysterious pneumonia deaths soon exponentially rise Right countries Europe lowest daily cases since early march, yes even UK.      
But oddly enough people reddit say proof herd immunity (""no, use word!"") works Sweden cases ""falling"" lowest since May... running .5% falling point per CDC. there's many people high degree immunity conferred previous coronaviruses, reducing denominator significantly. virus really seems fatal significant comorbidities. said, death estimate likely several orders magnitude. Regardless, still bad Asian flu late 50's killed 116k Americans population 172 mm. Minnesota always starts Labor Day state fair. even quiet part, wear badge honor believe churches taxed consider protected class. Compare countries’ lockdown here. Type Denmark example. Everyone assumes successful locked harder longer. didn’t. lockdown neither deep long ours. fits first hand experience well company’s danish counterparts went back office mid May 100 percent mask. company still isn’t back.

Their schools opened mid April. stil arguing September.

The US shutdown line Germany’s, fairly typical western world.

Mask use also higher America western average well. Look testing early on, NY/NJ obviously enormous amount cases never counted. Best estimation we’re catching cases now, remaining states point northeast early ... don’t expect spike slow anytime soon. It’s going get lot worse system catches up. Yes, actually started trying read clinical report 17 year old whose parents put patches 45 minutes waking would awake enough take Modafinil get going. 

The pouches super harsh throat though could make little nauseous. Also, swear gave type Cataplexy muscle weakness weird nicotine supposed prevent Cataplexy. legs would sometimes get really weak using even start buckle little. 

I'm hoping hear back Wakix soon get tachycardia control might also able add stimulant like Modafinil back in. 

Keep hanging good luck you. sister actually showed r/publicfreakout repost video along commentary. Essentially said he's always racist controlling asshole basically estranged him. Sounds like he's finally getting little bit deserves. Lol didnt everybody though? Oh thank God, mom recovering cancer step dad high school teacher son high school, may saved mom  valid reason, point view, already relatively social distanced Sweden considerably lower population death rate us Ireland, 

Ireland shut non-essential businesses, put 300,000 work, put 5km travel limit people, shut schools, creches, bars restaurants. 

Sweden didn't.  300 per day Poland everyone behaves like New Zealand. :(  nope, pointing facts. Canada high population density like parts America infected whole place. 90% Covid cases NH, ME, VT concentrated border touches near highly dense Massachusetts decided swim coronavirus. opinion Japan level density (and yea I've seen trains!) weak governance matter, South Korea major outbreaks among populations want found out, even lil ol Ireland badly better Sweden, (our public transport healthcare shadow 20 years ago), developed country excuse. ever was. Right, that's issue places utilities included rent. think called one. 

Hopefully everyone recovers. Tis strange hill stake out. debate family member big conspiracy theorist. can't wrap mind around also blindly believing told main difference whether believe something verify scientific research vs something learned fb post. #Herman Cain example us all. Southern California patients moved Bay Area due running beds. see move patients state. never much hinted ok Yup, many ripple effects!  I’m “landlord” rent small condo mortgage HOA costs. also pay rent larger place live kids. Thankful renters fine it’d put us major bind couldn’t pay us stuck paying mortgage/HOA plus rent. that's me.

For shits giggles checked see could ACTUALLY friend. Probably live state him. think I'd going crazy right moved away. likely weather conditions ask me. Sweden nowhere near herd immunity numbers, even take crazy low percentages like 50% like (explain one). predicting come back places like NYC Sweden fall. going crazy places like AZ TX know, maybe big difference behavior. Swedish people seem practicing social distancing anyway, hear mature enough without forced to. Oh yeah, sorry, talking that. referring claim Italians abnormally religious. There's lot fucked either way article, guess going back little better. Coming US, sounds wonderful grew raised Pentecostal.

Um, ""progress""? hid homes several weeks, nothing improve chances (like invest testing), erupted homes, we're Pikachu face. investment nothing got us return. dad really wants one semester can. uncle supposed last semester needs minor surgery got pushed back wait one semester. I’m scared Wow completely destroyed Mr. u/testiclelice point hospitalizations number/statistic? Covid forcing rethink way work. also rethink way teach. try groups five? teacher drop every day week use study partner system? duuude saw too. former roommate posted saying ""watch big pharma pushing"" 

remember girl Florida died parents tried treat home bunch bullshit? dude advocates cocktail ""treated"" with. bread circuses move friend know instead random asshole. Hence ""guys get along with."" I'm gonna move douchebag stranger. really get game don’t think teachers young children working home. feel horrible kids. :(

Preventative measures:

\- wear mask correctly

\- avoid crowds (especially people wearing masks)

\- wash hands

It's like zombie outbreak. one two... fixable problem. overwhelming swarm viral loads coming you, like Russian roulette computer time. Maybe light symptoms someone else won't. And, someone else someone care ... well, planning funerals managing estates grieving plain sucks. Who'd benefit conspiracy theory like that???

The Democrats teamed Chinese engineer whole plague made world sick make Trump look bad, according uncle saw Facebook meme cried saw picture Yeah shit, literally everyone Don’t see that’s relevant all. job can’t done home one else able work home either? people care less educating children getting children house 8 hours day move empty row? would even without covid lay Thank you. Ignorant murderers, like founding fathers 8% today, 20% tomorrow, 60% following day... groundbreaking treatment would announced way, one guy. Haven’t clicked link, already know sounds fake. Well considering it’s people offices never visit schools, I’m sure schools open Trump officially murderer. terrifying infuriating. remember fondly days everyone said ""don't worry, transmission US unlikely"". Look us now! first time people copying china sorry weird phone typo Encouraging masks, encouraging testing, encouraging people take seriously. anything, disappointed makes patriotic people turn blind eye everything happening country scream patriotism. believe true patriotism loving country enough notice good bad, able acknowledge love country, there's LOT shit needs fixed make better. one best version without acknowledging parts could better? People dead lying streets America

You want like Bergamo, suffered Eeek, eeek eeek oof, yikes. okay then. That’s awfully close Florida 9,989 new cases today. course not. Speed limits constution. Responding hurricane rescuing people constitutional. people saying whatever reason wishing moving goalposts 

Tell population densities two places happens Republicans take marching orders anti intellectual madman. Same. Never been, mom went like 15 years ago, said one best experiences life. here. double surprised me. 

But right what’s coming (and truly hope pray I’m not) think choice. safer bar? Thanks explanation. assume showing big year year changes data? guess banned subs 1945 wished Hitler's death well... Yep, resigned teaching middle school math. worth risk. parents always send kids school they're sick normal times. like different. Indeed. envy politicians figure solution. genuinely hope consequences help mature someone self serving psychopath. Incomes *up* past months. Actually probably *significantly* lower due number people asymptomatic mild symptoms. damn cultists. again, story story...

We get it: believe bearded sky daddy, desert daddy marries 6-year-olds, sky papa hates bacon - whatever. please, love that's holy, listen scientists hat gave *waves ambiguously* stuff stay fuck indoors months.

Your substitute father figure understand. Idiots there's plenty states. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) really. Coronavirus Mexico way worse US. daily deaths US like 40% population.  reason case count way higher limited testing capacity paradigm needing roommates affordable housing that's issue Dallas want convention either lol Public health decisions totally made people vested financial interest outcomes. can't think better system, possibly could go wrong? They’ve always giant Petri dishes. normal doesn’t kill kids parents co workers. deadly 40's too. .08% complete nonsense No, second wave implies dramatic drop case numbers followed period relative calm. clusterfuck. Yeah would love travel, airborne pandemic here. sure listening to. think ton Americans think way. I'm late 30s, I've never life thought US great... live terrible conditions. I'm white man college education mostly stable job almost 15 years. moment started learning systems (legal, election, medical, education, foreign policies, corporate power law making...etc), I've never thought 'wow, US strong, modern, intelligent system place. Everything long date. Back April governor said 70% state going get Covid 19. 250K cases population 40 million people, lot people recovered well. virus hates heat!

He must've blown virus sunbelt. take approach we’ve already lost millions die. Wear damn mask. Listen experts. Don’t go crowded venues busy malls. took personal responsibility America would handling like rest world is.. much better. They're suggesting, think, they're giving false positives tests admitting people. can't take anymore. makes sad anyone could think that! know someone covid, flu. almost died took weeks work towards recovery. someone suggest hospitals faking numbers makes sick. Given frequency questions comments wave we're in, thought helpful interesting read originally published author notes that, many ways, defining first wave second wave art science goes consult number public health experts, compares contrasts influenza epidemic, discusses would lead second wave. encourage reading it, however, keep mind week half old and, can, follow Politifact link instead. words first wave There’s official definition ""wave"" begins ends, generally speaking, requires peak infections followed substantial reduction. new rise peak would signal start another ""It probably realistic number new cases drop zero, ideally one would like see sustained decreases number new cases time stability number new cases time,"" said Nicole M. Gatto, associate professor School Community Global Health Claremont Graduate chart above, showing national picture, suggests easing number new cases, large drop prior current spike, scientists certain states come close finishing first wave. Yes. Yes is. However, tell bleach.

It bleach. empires. new teachers quit profession within first five years. state seen atleast 20% decrease students getting education degrees. feel like cost living increasing alarming rate legislation books makes near impossible raise taxes anything. 98 deaths yesterday’s count included numbers long holiday weekend. 

Today’s death total likely lower. tomorrow Friday.  always:

Freedom speech freedom consequence 4 days holiday, many people still using excuse.

Even though daily deaths Texas (7 day average) started trending mid-June.... hard soft power? evidence doesn’t persist body like herpes?

There's evidence coronaviruses general attack parts body herpes HIV live.

Saying ""is proof X"" entering place infinity absurdity. Scientists start ""I glass water handful dirt I'm going mix them, prove infinite number things vascular disease - risk stroke, cognitive damage, heart damage etc this?

Do reason think, majority people contract disease, risk changed all? vascular disease, anyone asking ""How much stiffer erections be?"" Probably there's basis think effect clear, whole argument contingent everyone able work home? yesterday citing Stanford doctor somehow says hospital ICU's full Covid. Also stated deaths jump yesterday holiday weekend. I'm exactly sure todays bullshit excuse true. wrong. Even thing low chance killing you... really want sick point needing hospitalized? fun bill Yes, typically low end. take alarmist projections double likely close coming reality.

And dont forget actual dead already , certainly overstated, possibly understated, since many die never get tested marked ""other causes"" like pnemonia heart attack.  Ohhhhh understand mean - mean people returned work less money.

I thought saying Florida, made 6 figures last year, give extra $600 (while unemployed). misunderstood point. Clear now! gains people Louisiana made Covid-19 June wiped past three weeks, Gov. John Bel Edwards said ""We statewide pandemic. longer one two regions,"" Edwards told reporters Baton Rouge. Louisiana's health department reported 1,891 new cases Wednesday, 95% community spread, according Edwards. Data Johns Hopkins University shows moving seven-day average cases state high since early first reported case Covid-19 came January 21. Within 99 days, 1 million Americans became infected. took 43 days reach 2 million 28 days later, Wednesday, US reached 3 million cases novel coronavirus. 3/10 Gambling addicts, meth addicts, gambling meth addicts. WH FB page days shared opinion piece 2nd wave coming everything fine soon. Yes, White House. that's expected nowadays huh.  right then, here: know gone build it, come. would agree. think sick teachers parents sick kids voting him? might cause merica. many not. Also, anger management therapist. known type requires /s understand language. wonder could possibly detected sarcasm /s. Oh yeah, person communication. Gotcha. That's Syracuse changed mascot Orange years ago. They’re looking avenues cut already.  Pretty sure sure? ""grandma died rattlesnake put covid!!!2!1!1!"" see link says also see direct recommendations refer Work Environment authority regulations regard PPE needed. Yup 😭 parents poor girl: REAP FUCKING SOW, ASSHOLES! corporations begging governmental restrictions

At point, everyone abandoned Trump. foolish pathological right thing, are. Alright less say worked 55 hours week, furloughed got whatever max location. company calls back work offer 28 hours per week. 

In Maryland make $475 week gross disqualified unemployment, including $600 CARES act. 

In Florida $300/week, based maximum benefit +/- 20% so. actually surprising bunch privileged millionaires lack "" common "" sense think . ""we"" take seriously, mean whole country, schools keeping virus sheer force will.

I know I'm one guy typing keyboard hope convince people this, convince people. 

The US alone. *lot* countries opened schools without major problems: disaster areas teachers dying every day. countries six-feet-of-space, masks-everywhere, disinfect-every-hour, lot countries **did much less** still minimal outbreaks.

Before quit without trying, let us investigate see Imagine kid acting spitting everyone. then?

Maybe straw breaks camel's back finally get gumption let teachers eject disruptive kids.

If teachers say ""we teach kids, need ability eject students violating safety guidelines,"" likely get teachers power, compared teachers saying ""woe, cannot it"" get steamrolled. Run correlation cases per 100K percentage population wearing masks, going get strong positive association. We're likely wear masks b/c outbreak worse. wear mask Norway either, need to. mean though? virus make every doorstep America around world eventually. would ""come together fight one group people""? celebrate half time

Who saying half time mark? virus starting. California twice amount people NYC, half number cases half number deaths. see anyone congratulate NY bash California. bending curve. miracle would US hotspot hospital despite idiotic things doing. would disease ""gone like miracle,"" indeed. Great. I’d like home state like this. happen know many Americans miss housing payments average month? “If don’t this, take this” Terrible numbers SC today. 38 deaths (apparently backlogged), 1500 cases, jump hospitalizations 1404, 21% positive. ""The customer always right. bartender decides still customer."" think go *across* industry service wide. reality Kindergarten teacher September. 6th year teaching. LOVE job, love kids. dangerous, potentially life threatening, sometimes wish option quit pandemic.

\- Classes around 20 kids per class (sometimes high 25) Two kindergarten classes per classroom AM/PM schedule

\- Small classrooms 4 tables 6 chairs available table. child gets 1.5 sq feet space table.

\- Incredibly poor ventilation air-flow, classrooms literally growing mold vents

\- one window per classroom opens 3 inches.

\- 25 kids sharing in-classroom bathroom get cleaned class leaves

\- Snack eaten inside classroom.

\- Lack resources human-power properly clean disinfect classrooms thoroughly often.

\-Masks mandated, lets real... 5 year olds masks general

\-Kids masks constantly licking, poking, nose picking, eye rubbing, snot wiping, rolling around

\-Story time carpet 20 kids

\-Children sharing cubbies AM/PM class

\-Children coughing, sneezing, lack proper hand washing, properly hand washing literally thing day.

\- Sharing toys play time, children needing comforted (especially beginning school year) Children generally understanding boundaries personal space

\-Sharing library books, school supplies, crayons.

\-Busses.

As kindergarten teacher gotten used tissue, snotted on, sneezed directly face, licked, coughed mouth talking student, tugged snotty hands, children try talk inches face, course hugged daily basis. (Not complaining last one, saying kids get 6 ft apart.) aid, instructional assistant classroom. enforcing safety rules September. Oh, also somehow stay focused enough, ***despite literal danger catching little -known pandemic causing virus,*** teach kids read, write, socialize respectfully, math, think scientifically, learn social studies, build health habits, problem solve, form letters numbers, deal emotions, learn routines student (lining up, unpacking, raising hands, pushing chairs, waiting turns, etc.) Oh usually 60% students also learning English, teach too. even peaked first wave yet I'm sure he's thrilled future employer's seeing first result background checks. Second wave? We’re still first. That's 20% entire population country downloaded it. 5 million altogether. one could seen coming. 

/s Dr. Fauci demonstrating ""well-fitted"" masks. He's demonstrating masks nose fittings. Please read posts carefully. Also simulation they're using relevant people closed spaces individual. open space, standing away ""jets"" droplets coughs sneezes, relevant. closed space, air circulating whether direction coughs sneezes protective. Finally, coronavirus carried huge droplets coughs sneezes. shed respiratory exhalations, even people even asymptomatic.

These studies example extremely inapposite/poorly framed/inadequate work Western medical professionals turning out, make waste time even read abstracts. They're example junk science said causing lot confusion lot people look people like Fauci answers. sad hear countries took seriously getting I’m stuck US trump “best people” administration. Make stop Good point! Bacon stop going get groceries, bank, post office, place might need go can't bothered something pathetically simple. I'm sure proud yourself. Hahaha, thinking thing Herd immunity thing particular virus. Again, need grow up. Offices past exactly that, past. workplace future involve substantially working home reduce disease transmission, environmental impats, healthcare impacts, infrastructure impacts. that's important person you? prefer person time kids coworkers? hate kids? seek family therapist.  can't compare whole United States single European country.

Look picture, divided States, maybe reconsider said.  Okay gotta ask. Isn’t blackmail extortion? Probably “the death count inflated” something sort  like wearing mask.. especially sunglasses on. pandemic, country divided. saying huge problem even pandemic. big issue country matter obvious right answer may immediately cause rift make impossible country come together.

 Democrats Rebublicans hate eachother point one party disagree disagree. George Washington even warned us absolutely right. political candidates include something campaign oppsoite party fear they'll lose votes even good thing. 

It's really sad case honestly see ever fixed. associate either party faults. parties things spite put other. think would rather put party right country.

 want president go grain, acknowledge crippling issue U.S. work Liberals Conservatives least little unified. Obviously ever fully agree everything situation bad. Lol socially distance pay even though ass landing time maximum discomfort Since right individual impede/override rights well-being others general public? maybe know sounds crazy maybe affects darker skin people due rate absorption vit 

&amp;#x200B;

just thoughts I've heard tossed around idea true Gotta know audience. selfish narcissist culture. looking deeply ingrained, people wouldn’t masks. mean know bad sounds?? need ordinance people give shit enough wear masks?! PhD's cheap labor. 5$ too. Bolsonaro phase 2 treatment: injecting disinfectants followed beaming UV rectum schools enforce dress codes. send kids home come without shirt something. Clearly rights aren’t absolute. Who, right mind, would want go casino right now?  Never thought school chorus, class can’t happen piece missing average American mostly agrees you... we're longer able control country government order make things happen.  government corrupt.

We're hopeful voting enough change things little fall, work, think there's better even chance unrest worse.  one, even GOP, wants four years Trump looting country. Like said, take leadership.

Getting open schools fall natural goal leader would urge people accomplish. would mean getting cases summer, ramping testing, adding staff, adding room.

It's possible do. see food rules hand washing rules mentioned. rules handle dead bodies seem helpful too, rituals involving washing, drying dressing body burying soon possible simple coffin. small team men usually responsible preparation burial duties.

Just fact bodies laying around viewing long death probably significant effect controlling spread. Agreed. Hate place anywhere. hate calling people well-promoted shit different, right? Yeah. don’t look categorise states. generally look positivity rates days doubling. Putting two things together gives good picture. Nonono, can't test people. would increase numbers, stupid. (Fucking obvious /s here) would prefer would hit baseball bats honest. idiots wear masks pay fines. real? Please tell isn’t real Much higher I’m sure. two weeks ago coming around idea still teaching best PPE. Now, refuse even step foot building get numbers awhile. 

They INSANE think we’ll actually show right now. teachers holding onto contracts long possible hopes go fully remote awhile. feel unpatriotic disappointed country makes want cry. Ive read 1920s pandemic par course America real Plandemic. 0. close.

The CDC says chance dying age 50 approximately 3 10,000. pledge cover copays medical bills funeral expenses associated Covid related medical treatment ticket holder visited park within 20 days getting positive test. fair, mainly talk hands wearing masks easier. Seems like stable genius me. No. literally people Texas think fake. like even happening. think mind control media. Car level 3? agree this, author article get 1% GDP downturn? clicked link looks like -5.3% 2020. right swing fist ends face. I'm really sure point here, can't hide manufacturing numbers supply chain issues propaganda. China indeed struggling implying global markets would see fast. talking auto manufacturers, medical, computer, food, damn near everything sold United States point. 

In February silicon parts hurt bad, apparent within weeks. I'm sure downplay extent can't reasonably expect us levels infections point time. main issue social media financial incentive address misinformation, conspiracy theories, outright hate, conservatives advertising bread butter. They're likely click ads convert click sales whatever dodgy vitamin supplement company advertising day. get antibody test. get one Quest LabCorp around $100. doctor’s order required. say?

*shocked Pikachu face* Yes definitely upsides. definitely teachers wish kids have, often wished could choose teachers instead one forced upon kids.

My point teachers refuse adapt figure way teach new reality, may well find replaced. think lot teachers think job guaranteed part problem. news, he's given contract mow WH lawn @ $100k/yr. What's interesting positivity rate California half Texas Florida quarter Arizona.

&amp;#x200B;

That least indicates California's problems bad states. even close. act like theres sick people right thing... Looking data country state really hiding rising trouble spots. nature growth, decline bad area hides rise places. 

Nationally getting past nyc numbers hide states' numbers people died within precise 45 minutes, safe open /s  Conservatives reaction: SEE TOLD U!!! MINOR FLU!!! U SHUT ECONOMY THIS?!?!? MAGA agree important look numbers. important find someone symptoms stop spread vulnerable groups. Also hospitalizations down. 56 Florida hospitals capacity ICU. point lethality rate increases hospitals many patients function optimally, like Florida.

It's oversimplification say economy hurt solely due statistical illiteracy. Uncertainty makes economy worse. Universities trouble enrollment largely due people uncertain Corona spread fall. Tourism also inability handle virus prevents people entering country others traveling within it. Employees also less likely go work kids going school want put kids school solid plans prevent kids getting spreading it. think tbh. whole GOP convention standoff seemed lot like Republican party Texas wanted someone else take blame cancelling. think governor step in, he'll try demonize mayor public eye. get it. need take mask speak. mean, move closer mike. They're Paris, too. today article detecting higher Covid levels sewage. department western France, testing revealed doubling cases two-week period 6 clusters identified, everyone department recommended get tested.

Even beat back R0 1, beast virus.  According CDC, IFR .26%. window open? Get fan? school leaning toward ""not forcing students wear masks"" issue turned ""political nature"". heavily considering leaving teaching together go this. lot precautions beside masks could taken insisted large droplet only. 

Like adding simple HEPA filters HVAC could prevented many indoor outbreaks reducing small droplets circulated buildings. 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣

I think would get along really well... staff experiencing fall collective efforts save lives years come, hope receive support desperately require. Working covid areas traumatic enough without dealing deluge hardest hit areas experienced Schools onsite day election Pence came today say CDC adjusting guidelines accordingly... news, sky blue. make effects less permanent. higher. going back list, not. clearly easy get control spending prolonged periods time indoors people safe. least high middle school levels. appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* state?  


For sure states going down, are, aren't. U.S. whole steadily declining deaths since middle April. Yep. See comment sources. actually insane nothing short revolutionary. grandmother Sicilian? prove DNA test. Funny often happens... Sometimes think reddit ghost. Yeah well, know mean, 95% infected people Covid19 less 3 months system. think point 62% *surge* beds occupied addition normal ICU beds. serious matter worth everyone’s concern. you’re correct beds converted ICU/COVID beds, still need medical staff care patients. medical staff stretched thin, quality care suffers. downplay seriousness situation, since many people acting like virus isn’t real. Hard say. though He's fired Tax-free property enough God's houses. Yeah you’re probably right that, man whoever hypothetical idiot player tests positive gets contact traced “player zero” infection is...whew. would absolutely dogpiled ruining everything. also wonder teams/the NBA security monitoring hotels. get hospital immediately. could mini stroke. pastors, leaders places worship also responsibility what's best people. 

Why can't hold virtual services etc. 

Why right endanger public. God really wants? people endanger lives others put heavy burden hospitals care providers? kind witness God this? Fine way represent! middle surge. hospital twice many cases even waiting test results for. Opening middle incredibly stupid puts millions risk.  8 days Minneapolis one point USA hit max # new cases reported depends # tests taken place day. sure high number tho, that's 100K, # positive cases reported day likely exceed number. problem own, i.e. lame-asses WH might pick 'see? stabilizes!'... weeeeee exponential growth! Yeah, agree lot Ford's policies (his cuts healthcare pre-pandemic times definitely aged like milk), really heartening see Canadian parties working together COVID.

I've worried Canadian politics becoming polarized spiteful US politics, I'm hopeful this, we'll see cooperation parties (I still think minority governments feature bug, force actually work together), least level respect proud Italy! That’s nuts. able get doctor referral? 

Here Australia call doctor free Telehealth appointment get referral free test emailed us. means don’t need unnecessarily expose themselves. 

I got tested week ago. Called midday make appointment, doctor called back 2:45pm. got tested 3:30pm (drive testing site) doctor call results next morning. 

I know it’s much easier due situation much lower demand testing moment people can’t get tested 30 days that’s huge issue. No, say blown really happening. saying still saying this. Outdoor class recommend, happen rain season bad season come? county cause I’m summer county thing anyways? Fuck ties daily deaths still low. I'm worried daily cases want fall 500 (weekly average) since June.    
And also situation Guiana concerning.     
Globally however, hospitalisations, icus, positive rate still declining. Perfect short term solution Yeah, exactly like 1. agreement that.
1a. People exercise Second Amendment rights responsibly pandemic armed meaning they're going around indiscriminately shooting innocent people.
2. feds could help states Yurtle Turtle Senate seem think warranted. 
The feds indeed give PPP loans. Monday Trump administration released names companies received PPP loans $150,000 more. far Forbes found least 44 companies backed 16 billionaires received loans designed help small businesses stay afloat. One Florida auto dealership Braman Motorcars, owned billionaire Norman Braman (Net worth $2.4B) received total $16 million $36 million. Money could help hundreds struggling small businesses. Treasury applying policy ""make rich richer poor poorer.""

Now lovely day stay safe. I'm actually starting wonder, improving treatments lowering death rate somewhat, there's paradoxical effect people previously would died freed beds surviving needing stay hospital longer. would make important flatten curve treatments effective run completely room. Winter coming? transferred prisoners Chino, already massive outbreak. CDoC test people transferring them, selected inmates show symptoms. outbreak San Quentin started transferred prisoners became symptomatic almost immediately arrival. true, although states reported early Cases increased 50% month, that's insane. waiver real thing. teach florida one northern counties already asking teachers sign. union told sign it! family member CO there, says shitshow. work inmate population now, that's probably going change guards get sick. seeing while. actually works me. Maybe Tucker Carlson Rush Limbaugh gospel anymore. 

Lol nah saying. obviously Obama's fault. Agreed. actually think absolutely enforce laws deemed constitutional. sheriffs filing suit immediately. court could put hold whatever law ignore law works way courts. course, that's is. elected officials choosing laws want follow don't. fucked up, much done it. constituents going whoop holler great sheriff can't scream because, know, COVID. blame controlling outbreak city. Bringing closer god thought Smart move afford that. September declared essential workers expected die job like nurses essential workers. wish worldometers.info covidmetrics.com reported hospitalizations could compare.

So far hospitalizations AZ, FL, TX, etc increasing far slower reported cases, I'm guessing testing widespread probably finding cases among young healthy hospitalizations far less likely. wait til hurricane season wife got tested 3 weeks ago. Drove convention center,
took 45 mins. could also look German Wikipedia article: lazy Google translation: Due almost simultaneous occurrence encephalitis lethargica Spanish flu, Stern (who later revoked thesis) later Ravenholt Foege suspected 1982 two diseases related. However, McCall colleagues unable detect influenza RNA archived tissue samples 2001 thus could confirm presumption. [1]

Just sure: saying right also experts stating different things. hate defend Trump, please remember quickly got ppp money Kushners, Invanka, others supported him.

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19801187 diseases cause permanent damage spreading exponentially Every hospital different... obviously rural hospital probably capicity less covid patients versus major urban hospital. 

Obviously spread gets worse major hospitals 0 surge capicity need transfer patients rural hospitals... never see post talking protest's ""surge"" coronavirus.  Americans, lots lots dumb Americans. casino work always jam packed. Based upon serosurveys, anywhere close herd immunity. However, looking good right now, low deaths low cases. I'm sure explains current success. Summer? Better protection care homes? idea. make idiot politicians look good.

Please vote current republicans Nov. Maybe except mitt romney. can't believe enough garbage/ hefty bags...../s Literally thinking this. data conclusive answer/directions/tips ultimately mean nothing unless you’re running tests solutions yourself. guy Disneys government tried tell people cover mouths, wear masks, stop massive beach parties. meant get state take action, actually SOMETHING NFL though  7 14-day trends smooth shit out, account lack testing positivity rate. Canadian don’t like Trudeau, due hypocrisy (the list pretty long, like climate change, transparent government (JWR, parliament shut-down), ethics (third breach ethics investigation now), electoral reform, Liberal fiscal record (I’m talking Covid, promised balance budget threw promise dumpster soon elected) 

That said, think there’s much less difference left right politics Canada compared friends south. someone right center (mostly fiscal policy), generally support Trudeau done (my main complaint didn’t respond developing crisis Feb. obvious going shit show) support lockdown, 100% support masking public places agree part fiscal support businesses individuals (my concern I’ve heard it’s rich it’s disincentive work) Oh yeah, sticks dirt grass outside fair game. stop putting rocks mouth though... Yep agree, economic side awful well effect education. government need help too. addition government assistance people dire straits may need move back parents temporarily, downsize, etc. sending millions kids teens back school daily sit small rooms various groups 30, multiple times school day, help make sure virus spreads quickly possible surely worse alternative. 1000 deaths yesterday mid summer school session. Yeah, would rather live country taken serious steps combating virus reached major milestones efforts instead one still actively hitting new time daily highs new cases little action coming government. call miracle persistence, miracle hard work miraculous achievement. Miracle, own, meaning 1 quote. Ironic worried manipulated deep state, blindly exactly another state's government tithes. heard 3m hiring thoughts prayers

\- pence  need patients though get stimulus money though! mental gymnastics people must go through. Like seriously. that’s point, misread data. 9% additional phase 2 capacity occupied normal ICU beds. 9% calculated *without* phase 3 capacity.

So 100% normal capacity, 9% phase 2 capacity, 0% phase 3 capacity. words, 62% normal + phase 2 + phase 3 capacity. Easter! Fill pews! think people forgetting protests main cause recent spread.... #,,l,,(-_-),,l,, sure Sikhs/Indians? observation generally people middle east say that.

Money isn’t going dictate state opens. can’t run economy hospitals can’t keep up, really one choice current preventative measures aren’t followed don’t work. I'm going educate you. fact using personal attacks scientific condescension make point ""science"" obviously know what's wrong hydroxychloroquine studies even though they're junk science even Lancet retract one tried publish for, things, bad data, demonstrates completely ignorant subject.

I'm saying hydroxychloroquine coronavirus treatment, I'm saying tide junk science debunking hydroxychloroquine (a cheap, abundant medicine can't exclusively licensed price-gouging) promoting Gilead's $3K/dose remdesivir (another viral inhibitor issues limitations hydroxychloroquine, much less well understood unclear mechanism action), example ways get ripped America's high-stakes, unethical ridiculously overpriced infectious disease medical pharmaceuticals. predatory, price gouging medical professional community becomes obvious anyone cares enough actually read papers themselves.

Cases Texas Florida peaking almost month now, without death rate anywhere near rate northeast March/April? 🤷‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️🤷🏼‍♀️🤷🏽‍♀️🤷🏾‍♀️🤷🏿‍♀️🤷🏿‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏽‍♂️🤷🏼‍♂️🤷🏻‍♂️🤷‍♂️ mean, certain amount unwell admitted anything, ok person positive COVID isn’t actually sickened COVID, *second* deadly virus going around? large numbers people accepting need ICU facing ruinous medical bills feel fine? Like what. not. Sounds like they’re relying God’s protection virus. 

Doesn’t book say something something put Lord test? world recovering. shame embarrassment dangerous American days. [Didn't random testing sample Bergamo show ~60% population percent need herd immunity?

I'm trying downplay significance this, might result disease running course population rather policy decisions. I’ve started go Karen report state now. CT nice little web form fill click submit. I’m done people’s bullshit putting others danger.  School summertime?! Good job California. Focus health people ignore tweeter chief. Whenever think can't get worse... lower positivity rate likely testing enough. 5% ideal right now. Cali 7% think? Florida 14%, Arizone 25%.


New York, Peak Virus, 42%, get enough tests then.


Arizona, Florida Texas less two weeks medical systems overwhelmed.

Well, Arizona probably less 2 days it. responsible thing do. Thank you! teacher, completely agree this! Target mandate mask themselves, grocery stores around have, except target walmart, feel like that's anti-maskers go shop now.

Its funny Target home Depot represented letter yet mask mandate stores like listening doctor say “Take drug”, completely ignoring dosage advice instead swallowing whole bottle pills soon get home. end well.


Right line everything else. 

Just like “learning learn virus” meant needed social distance, close open flexibility avoid hotspots, wear dam mask use common sence. 


But took converted “Everyone going get it” lets get with. level shame I've felt lately part human race like nothing I've experienced before. guess I've always seems like naive hope world fit category narcissistic way people acting something unbelievably simple wearing mask literally potential save lives beyond disheartening. Yup Well shit, wait virus rages population anything it. catch early, contact trace quarantine people spread.

Then again, go route America say ""fuck it, lol lets see happens!"" wonder rest world pretty good watch cases explode much country never shut follow guidelines reopen.

Plus, value health citizens government pays healthcare. US, falls citizens pay way disease economically feasible government citizens risk they're paying. Except damaging morale work force, I'm economist... also go need wear mask well ventilated areas like outside?? Especially virus hang hours dumb sure realize many people live there. Lombardy, regional capital Milan, population 10 million. Lazio, region Rome lies in, 5.8 million.

Lombardy 16,725 deaths, Lazio 842.

Your question like asking little news coronavirus Chicago much freezer trucks full dead bodies NYC. Fucking arm security guard, then. Lives *dirt*-cheap US! Same. Went Italy last year first time. Lovely country great people. Yep. That's part ""signing up"" talking about. would still hurt employees later road, even company paid now. matter fact. Certain quarterly targets met, shareholders happy stock value goes down, employees laid off.

I hate say that's capitalism. Economy #1!! one listens base. yeah, probably used correct term, figured states pretty much context explaining something basic (how large Canada's provinces are) used states.

But edited make intent clear accurate. There's actually [two North South. brother started started quarrelling, split company. could corporate culture difference suppose. Appearently North owns danish branches Trader Joes, South runs US Aldis. Todd Clorox strikes again! Looks like deleted. Like said, sure legit not, though user Reddit year posted fair bit forum (and ferrets forum).

Here's link deleted thread: comment allegedly quote waiver, slightly redacted: California? keep sending emails everything still go start date changed since governor go ahead. live northern California news stories reported places opening despite closures Sheriff kept putting messages saying enforce stay home orders, so, yeah. case US till like 90s. still ashtrays lecture halls university (built chairs) case Brexit, purported real groups lots people / businesses members. vote over, disbanded trace exists.

The flip true, either - anti-Brexit groups sites mostly exist form. they're real groups real people (moreso). I'm always ready two shots want clarify something: believe 1) Human rights conditional; 2) government violate them? think someone said positivity rate 20% basically stop testing assume everyone infected. know that's based false negative rates though. Great Americanites arrived set world straight know situation there. Trump symptom real problem u look back months back, places cult main sources spread, still are, remain closed till get vaccine, period. wants publicity.

But hey that's worked once... Like really recently even. effective vaccine true followers. How? eradicates idiots using 'rona. vaccine idiots. hoping COVID would act like FLU, even Coronaviruses weaken disappear warmer temperatures. 

That clearly case, feel dumb hoping was. People also forget vaped too. I’m talking harmful dab carts vitamin E. products like Magic Flight Box, Pax, Sublimator (don’t think make anymore boy beast) Yes people go directly A&amp;E instead consulting doctor non-Emergency problems. always problem Sweden countries. can’t believe talking daily death trends short period time thinking successful. sad. since March 17.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Ok fair broken arm maybe best exemple. important point trying make HIV disease ever clear. 

Neither varicella virus. get chicken pox, virus life, often comes back rears ugly head later life (that's causes shingles). 

You literally saying someone immune infected life. truly thought *need* prayers Good. Workers refuse wear mask fired. 

Folks wearing masks contribute spread, meaning lockdowns necessary. Wearing mask means EVERYONES job remains open. comparable Sweden. Sweden whole developmental category Russia is. might well start comparing Sweden countries bottom development indexes well. They're different stages development. Unless really think Sweden messed Russia is? mean, think Sweden messed *that* bad.

Sweden apples apples similarly developed countries, best compared Nordic neighbors afraction problems Sweden care. people congregating crowded area, go home that?  Sounds pretty stupid thing do. That's consistent saying ""outside required can't maintain 6ft social distancing"". saying outside need social distance? They'll safer anywhere world except live.  Holy shit Really crossing fingers also super worried. :( I’m 100% sure, didn’t speak coroner directly. assuming dilated Cardiomyopathy... explained heart enlarged left ventricle calcified. won’t official cause death paper like 14 weeks wait toxicology reports. saw cardiologist passed, stress test, EKG Echocardiogram done, wore heart monitor 48 hours. results came back normal, heart okay. Thank god.

Kind side note, complaining trouble breathing weeks prior death, diagnosed via Telehealth bronchitis. know others think Telehealth great thing, happened personally don’t trust it. seen person listened heart, got BP readings, etc, *might* caught. 30, one would think heart trouble without vital signs back up. build wall Florida make Florida pay it. world living in, important clarify smoking good idea case personal attack, frankly, accusing person personal attack be, legally manslaughter case winnable. tried everything. Used able smoke regularly much fun. Eventually turned thing could best mood, relaxed, second hits system it’s nothing negative thoughts aren’t even true. beating every perceived flaw. exception I’m opiates, it’s fine. Must area brain triggered (I read something happening people). 

I’ve tried CBD absolutely nothing even extremely high doses. tried lot daughter taking epilepsy wanted test see like. Nothing. one night glass wine taking forgetting even taken it- massive anxiety. whatever, I’m THC CBD! jokester, goofin hyukin Plus fantasy permanently working home it’s that; fantasy. 

As soon employers employees back office, will. Productivity home likely lower office kids distractions around. Plus access employees one place. think actually interested public health? dangerous, dangerous conspiracy theory peddling. 12. Babar's house. people can't suggesting, though. people come abusive households college escape. people major super hands-on curricula medicine, engineering, chemistry/biology, etc. cannot get sort quality online education, telling spend $10k+/year online education. people can't defer either, they'll lose scholarships options taking retail/service job automatically puts higher risk infection. International students must take classes in-person US face deportation. people's friends/professional successes made in-person college experiences going incredibly hard mental health struggles.

This simple ""stay home, online, keep schools closed"". students that, entire economy would still remain semi-reopened yet millions students would simply left unemployed uneducated 1.5+ years wait vaccine might come soon enough. new? seen before:

""Individuals must procure, fashion, otherwise obtain face coverings wear public are: 

* within six feet distance individuals; 
* situation setting unable maintain six feet distance individuals; 
* public private transportation carrier for-hire 1. pretending completely worthless shit show initial spread COVID frankly entire time?

2. US different culturally demographically 1st World countries. would say less submissive. Meaning people personally know would rather get COVID give freedom. doubt common sentiment elsewhere 1st world. American Christians actually worship Freedom, define God given right whatever feel like written Moses Constitution high unemployment rate, virus still hiring? hate flow young apprentice...

 

Let hate flow young apprentice... literally data, definition, know long term damage rate Wait. make sense Kenneth Copeland blew covid19 away, even see It’s matter “not able decide”. Again, *policy-making* body. cannot make proclamations without *data back up*. Remember ibuprofen debacle? made announcement based Tweets doctors, walk back data came out. putting information impact globally, *novel pathogen*. Frankly, worked research, cannot begin grasp much time actually takes learn pathogen. We’ve looking malaria vaccine *a hundred years*, we’re learning virus breakneck speed, even doesn’t feel like it. cannot see coordinated effort standing doesn’t mean one doesn’t exist.

But here, demand personally applicable material life, infographics: Wow. PA offered variety options well, CANNOT IMAGINE living like that. doubt, anyone arrested. different arrest I. 

Who arrest sheriff varies based state. take Midofinil? take wonders. seen 3 altercations location due selfish assholes refuse comply statewide order.

 - Aldi, store manager told person leave cart stuff go get mask come back escorted premises banned.
 - local BigBox store another person refuse wear mask store manager said 2 choices, go car come back wearing mask arrested trespass assault person threatened store employee
 - 3rd one little old lady screaming rights escorted store duty state police person I'm sceptical rushing vaccine mass distribution. Sounds dangerous. I’m teacher consider high risk underlying heart condition. taken ever precaution keep safe since March. return kindergarten classroom five days week. fearful get Covid students 3 grade wear mask. 12 students alternating schedules. Parents send kids school fever reducing Rx. Fever checks useless. Carriers asymptomatic. Seems though politicians worried parents getting back work. teachers rights? work large urban school district Ohio although asked fill questionnaires...I felt though PR stunt make employees parents feel though voice reality it’s wealth health. district mostly concerned teachers babysitters educators. Video breaks curve increase COVID-19 cases: Open windows improve ventilation. Keep distance him, especially face face, risk pretty low. Yes it’s bad thing. Let hate flow young apprentice... Better fired kill yourself, family, students, family. I’d thought learned lesson after:

“In two weeks (or so) confirmed cases go up”

And

“In another roughly two weeks hospitalizations go up”

But nooo keep arguing time, despite proven track record plenty warning, magically virus won’t start killing people.

Now sitting back, probably working next flimsy excuse isn’t bad need reopen sooner/faster.

Siiiigh. poll tell truth, fucking coin flip. people US way higher standards living people Idris Brazil. Seems there's awful lot poverty US. Recent events highlighted it, still ignore it. Shameful. good ICU admissions dropping, true. saw article literally facepalmed:

The 560+ number, ventilators fire, ceiling falling, says all. U.S. followed advice, less people would died. really bad thing? US taxpayers fund universities disproportionate amount assistantships go foreign students. told graduate school, qualify financial aid form loans students don’t get priority assistantships. Maybe mean deserving US students get assistantships. Also humility obeying governors. I'm aware. can't fire every teacher, especially since MI fucked pension programs benefits much. coordinated push MEA good amount teachers, power. alternative bad compared ""illegal"" active, means law bad duty disobey it. truly think Whitmer would flinch push back large enough collective. Either way, teachers going able teach they're dead. Rather fired dead I’m saying scare tell we’re AZ. govt enacted Crisis Care plan basically allows hospitals rank everyone comes in. assign points things sliding scale based person preexisting conditions, old are, many years they’d expected live successful treatment, etc. people lowest points prioritized treatment. younger people less ailments get bed treatment meanwhile older person lets say diabetes example get turned away they’ll wait ages seen/helped. lethargica

jesus thats messed condition, never heard either. local FB crapshow said 1% dies 5 kids per school.

Maybe separate hearts burnt offering sp500. It’s going 4 million mid August. heard first ""good news"" antibody tests promised available maybe going available fall? hear you.

What’s really crazy churchgoer caught COVID-19 nearly died. put ventilator barely made haven’t fully recovered yet, still church anti-mask anti-social distancing. pastor encourages handshakes hugs.

These even care homes ""convicted"", ""under investigation"". put perspective:  (""Retirement Homes Corona Crisis: 'Supply completely inadequate'""). think another activity people packs many people, especially many vulnerable people, close proximity, inside, long time regular basis Trump rallies? may problem, may one biggest problems. Churches need better this! Worst administration worst time recent history. Literally info came days ago. entirely possible got ""positive"" diagnosis Ts &amp; Ps Yeah means God's plan suffer years.

Just like plan kill millions children every year famine.

The lord works ~~murderous~~ mysterious ways. No, conditions airborne whole time. 16 hours. Kanye idiot attention whore. study asymptomatic cases haven’t doing.

Lol would anyone take time get tested they’re feeling sick? Spare “it’s act loVe” propaganda try live reality. 

Good ol’ Covid-19. virus terrible won’t even know unless happen get tested. didn’t like Distance learning last year I’d rather distance learning putting risk school. Schools basically germ farms! sheriff's office smaller counties surrounding Houston came opposed Gov Abbott's mask wearing mandate. almost joke now. really wish wearing mask right either state federal law actual punishments attached dont so. really cant going easy people neglect best practices hurt others. Pero qué ha pachado? ppl can’t see past nose grandma said. GOP hitched trump co.   get away story itself. study showed people refuse wear masks personality disorder - maybe narcissism might sociopath. course. protesting actually slows spread. You’ve got churches actually care people &lt;3 Like us 50k cases day.. till take close decade rate get 50% sick herd immunity. 

I'm young, healthy, willing get virus help community become immune overall. want feel like there's better way putting country hold 10 years mandatory store managers afraid enforce seriousness, need someone like presidential candidate.. choices comical best. many years freely let kids go school chances catching something *far* higher catching viurs? Keeping schools closed makes sense. Lemme guess. Small town nurse really exposed numerous cases? takes courage admit something wrong specially every small things becomes big everything politicized. feel like read exact headline months ago think SEC try Hell like 50 voters. assuming everyone else stays home Many Latinos devout Catholics Catholic Church idea use birth control. i'm seeing sorts ""information"" good statistic. hospitals overrun covid patients plus reasons. also election year media exaggerating.

wondering icu capacity normally anyone articles/studies supporting ""the media's"" fear mongering. directly states article person least hospitalized covid-19, mild infection? study rodent model cones issues default, I'm suggesting tit necessarily fit image expect given prevalence Marijuana use California anticipate lower death rates compared states.

We need way testing people going read assume damaging lungs smoke going fight disease. dangerous counter study like mainstream view Marijuana basically harmless. Karen-Borne Science 

We Karens ""Virus-is-a-hoax-side ""Combine-words-from-headlines-to-make-me-sound-smart"" Karen's side. Stupidity prevalent nowadays Surprise surprise. anything I'm comfortable with. friends probably misinformed imo “Only 5 kids”. It’s sickening acceptable outcome them. idiot opinion probably applies current regime...I mean administration. wonder district make conscious decision forgo whatever federal funding normally get broadly proclaim ""we value kids money"" main point basically younger people never interact older people. someone believes that, there's really nothing say person. I'm proud mom's church. chose keep services Zoom keep congregation safe. Even though area large amount cases, still gives peace mind taking proper precautions. Maybe share data death rate children many orders magnitude lower 1%. hope wears Trump stroking fuck out. vaping.

They also potentially penalizing players break rules taking draft picks away one play-in teams 1st overall draft draft lottery results. Hockey players tend team oriented, that's big individual players holds weight. must actually care citizens. Wow Yep that’s plan. hope though, since much state remained sane. buy frozen food heat home. There’s Applebee’s! looked 7-day average (deaths) looks pretty level me. Honestly sure you’re referring to. 7-day average cases way up... meant? I’ve astounded sheer number Ohio politicians seem trying top making stupidest possible comments. guy running unopposed? Fabulous. Even march looking numbers versus smaller Asian countries *should* used case studies, obvious missing metric crapton cases many deaths having. Instead narrative, people tried make death count seem legit. Isnt reddit wants? see posts US meddles everything. That’s “pro life” party you. little news 985 deaths yesterday US.

Combine takeout concessions coney dogs nice evening. literally trumps worst appointee. awful, wife MLM scammer whose never stepped foot public school profits predatory student loans run education system shameful. give restaurants money directly? Outdoors benn shown tto much safer, perfect. Also, change lot cooler weather based recent research US military saw virus survives fridge least 2 weeks (length study) 🤣 Good time “The infected person offer guilt offering sin offering, rabbis added requirements repentance well.” Send desert! Good. high time religion dies out. pun intended. hiked quandry peak two weeks ago starting 5am. time started close 8:30 hundreds people way up. EVERYBODY hiking, camping, biking, etc. really bad thing? US taxpayers fund universities disproportionate amount assistantships go foreign students. told graduate school, qualify financial aid form loans students don’t get priority assistantships. Maybe mean deserving US students get assistantships.

It's largely STEM phds chore slog though guarantee higher starting salary graduates bachelors degree STEM field. engineering student born US makes sense: 4 years ECE 100k salary graduation 4 years ECE, plus another 4 years PhD slavery starting salary 45k postdoctoral researcher hopefully lucking tenure track position 100K? even need studies know indoor anything spreads virus faster? many times scientists, doctors, etc. say outdoor activities safer, still wear masks? 

Now, imagine sitting indoors surrounded people wearing masks, sharing bathroom, counting 16 year old employees clean everything properly. I’m telling customers put one job. Got email director asking us enforce it. Hell no. don’t get paid enough risk getting screamed potentially assaulted. I’ll wear mine, let managers fight them. released Sunday obligation, instructed church hop, every pew blocked off. sitting families. shaking hands Communion tongue. singing. church work held reopening I’m thankful team common sense. Mitch wants grant stimulus payments Americans make $40,000. everyone else world isnt hurt pandemic well. kindergarten level, you’re actually pretty safe kids. Small children spreading this. Kids getting getting adults. theory it’s part lungs contaminated droplets form well developed. It’s clear grow this, personally danger going back school adults you’ll need around. call Swedish Herd Troll Russian Karma Bot?

That's normally do. 

Oh, wait.. ""play victim card week"". forgot. That's church set up. We're still broadcasting service online comfortable coming in. still people complaining ""not normal again"" ""Jesus protect mask"". matter many policies safety protocols announce, people want listen. husband (pastor) told people he'd rather complain singing give eulogy. Mine too! think really need separate mega churches everyone else discussing church. Mega churches often times ones getting attention totally different small community church. Ha! Another specific-movie-seat person! take center seat, CENTER center--I take one-third-of-the-way-in-from-the-screen-center. amazing months, still struggle expand testing infrastructure... Yeah, make schools open like Arizona Texas Florida Nevada..... said...


big, BIG /S Seeing nothing town, stay away local businesses. Drive give shit. Stupid fucking Republicans. megachurch yet meet person all. 💯 support this. Scroll picture. Plently people wearing masks. Plus, masks 100% effective. thousands people yelling spitting within half feet other, somehow, magically, spread COVID. What???

That's hard discuss leftist (and people hard right). Logic flies window try argue positions. 

You're answering question. NY times concentrate 650 cases, might 30 million USA? true, chaos back *precisely* pandemic waning. directly related pandemic. reading article says 650 cases linked religious services. someone help understand major source cases?

I'm keeping churches closed think dumb open, dont like pushing false narratives either. high school, first time remember hearing assembly sophomore (86 87). Even didn’t feel much urgency - interested new terminology sex acts heard. don’t think stopped anyone knew wanted. said, 16 older, almost everyone stupid invincible age. adults ignoring terrifying me. embarrassing American even need enforcement. put mask, ffs. We're better Louisiana.. Governor joke handling virus social distancing/masks. No, mixed old young people waiting rooms. even read copy? 

If sort Deaths per Million people, UK pretty much top list (apart outliers)

So worst place world contract virus chance death outcome greatest - go meal? Thank link. I've spent much time trying convey dad serious, he's still hanging onto 'it's flu, old people dying it!'

Never mind fact he's living mother/my grandmother moment, older, WOULD genuinely risk people 60+ ok this. Faith protect us older parishioners die coffers filled younger attendees won’t enough keep Peter dish going. Actually lots churches electronic tithing still get offering without person worship. Honestly lot people tired isolation church part social group. wife would love attend person understand elderly parents living us safe even wear masks watch live stream home pastors sermon. pressure Pastor church members attend person feel safe. &lt;3 I’m sorry loss. appreciate well wishes. worry part plan. Muslims say insha'Allah. hope sarcasm. 
People need stop going goddamn house parties restaurants Plus another one two weeks cases actually reported. anti-mask people come around. Many needlessly die interim,


Others needlessly die. anti maskers care.


The mask one person wears, another persons first line defense. mask slow trap biohazards someone spewing sneeze, cough, talk, breathe.


When everyone spewing clouds potentially biohazardous breath everything, everyone else much safer. less likely walk cloud Covid, touch something sprayed Covid.

Other precautions need continue,social distance, 6ft rules, disenfecting surfaces, washing sanitizing hands, wear mask. get effective. Honestly, Covid sped lot trends, including working home, transfer boomers online shopping experience, continued changes higher ed. Churches panicked shrinking memberships years, losing base spreading disease? good organized religion. article people going emergency room non-emergency things related coronavirus, anything closer issues corona. #She believes risk old young people seek emergency care non-emergency complaints mixed waiting rooms, especially view risk infection.

""mixing corona patients uninfected patients"" gotten here.  gave stat we’ve known months? Florida: hold beer... AU racist country Asians. surprised want escape close-up observation. Maybe lesson cooking food thoroughly. pray, get COVID god’s plan.
Who argue? /s Ima tell right literally sit line outside DMV Capitol (this hour 14 count yesterday) good thing, people wearing masks line (as i) lot people frankly, amount people waiting crammed together different packed deck patio bar restaurant 

I probably already caught shit 100% person sort serious issue (thats even fucking fault) wanna say correlation people using terms like 'Wuhan Coronavirus' making Ill-informed bad faith arguments... yet see evidence contrary Hey hey hey stop political talk. makes mods nervous Anti data fucking data. You’re quoting fucking poll. 

Dipshit Trump losing every fucking poll. Yet come election won. 

Take polls shove em ass.

The ridiculous number people giving rip around terrifying. rural Ohio neighbors think they're exempt something, honestly get it.

Vitale moron. sheriff literally saying he’s enforcing violates ‘constitutional  really make up. laughed Scriptwriters guild, whatever is, overuse disaster tropes.

So, infections continue (exponentially), spread beyond younger age groups, hospitals continue fill up, hurricane popping around would topper.

To get past pearly gates actions recent coming months... That's Karen Exactly reason can't enforce quarantines. reasons violent crime spiking cities. Cops want go jail face splashed across internet jobs. collect paycheck stand rubber bullet guns people whatever want. 

You think they'll go people broke quarantine order now? Keep dreaming. Go one states well baby. First flash bang. seem remember lots people sub *very* defensive idea reopening months ago. *something something “the economy.”* Imagine time energy invested nationwide infrastructure fight virus. Imagine money invested keeping us economically stable even (heaven forbid) miss work long time. 

The world won’t truly “back normal” there’s vaccine. meantime need leaders care people’s lives care reopening salons. tell story PA. Every business around Phila taken seriously point guards enforce line markers mask wearing, compacity limits. gov requiring masks everywhere even outdoors public, still seeing somewhat rebound. good news Reddit since hate churches Trump checked shifted decisions states.

Churches: paying taxes accepting free handouts since AD 30 quarantine numbers get low enough able test, contact trace isolate infected. course withdrew, GOP still massive amount historical structures crush. get paid ripping shit down, continue country unrecognizable.

They underestimating coming backlash, way Clinton democrats underestimated tea party movement. Throwback English implied freakin England lmao said kudos ""whistleblowers"" Health Social Care Inspectorate Sweden last post, guess hear weeks now. also referenced ""one twenty-two"" said twitter everyone agrees government guilty, could guess doctor trying argue scientifically said something like would stir storm.  come 99% dads freak fuck touching thermostat dont give fuck global warming? Kanye West Inc received tons Cares Act PPE money actual small businesses couldn’t get help. peddling garbage?? 

Not saying don’t need careful vaccine. he’s speaking vaccine doesn’t exist yet point scaring people safety conspiracy theory.

Once actual vaccine studies, consider danger risks might be. nurse reported things back April government investigations started. Florida sends people, they're sending best Now, imagine sitting indoors surrounded people wearing masks, sharing bathroom, counting 16 year old employees clean everything properly.

Already myselft multiple occasions since opened restaurants here.

First there's lot space tables, before. 

The restaurants general good taking necessary precautions, guests. probably part surge following holiday weekend. keeps up, yes definitely relevant. i've probably linked predicting triple deaths within couple weeks. making young people sick too! 6 months ago ONE sick, millions are, looks like classic US government conspiracy! predators exploiting dumb religious. Sweden ‘Merica Scandinavian countries according Finnish friend. Finland isn’t Scandinavian. Get trump write executive order open schools parents wouldn’t allowed anywhere near children attended church like this. saw post person said wearing mask hard, seeing people masks time scary. Noped fast could. Yikes. *February obvious SVT article linked one: get stressed 80-year-olds sit waiting room young people come prove covid. also find many patients careful used be, ”she pandemic, were, among things, tents patients assessed outside emergency room. significantly fewer people seek covid symptoms, reasonable staff, says Katrin Hruska. Mälar Hospital, patients respiratory symptoms isolated rooms, efforts made reduce risk try keep apart move chairs apart distance waiting room, can't maintain many patients. even patients care much come something call health care center before. also seen people, example, seek stomach ache, also cough on. new perspective, nurse reported things back April investigations started. maybe reinterviewed finnish news-site. new it? agree. hope people close close cases start popping up. time proactive imo university announced full person back April local public school went trying person, unless made major changes since graduated way able comply guidelines. I’m senate side. Supreme Court surprise sure, welcome one. lot people(including me...

Wat 69 thonk. announced week drug work? confusing say work think comes comes hatred President Trump. many contradicting studies. One thing sure young lady gone party. parents responsible. Nope, GOP lead states course!

/s irrelevant, removed. Fauci says ""false narrative"" ***take comfort lower coronavirus death rate***

Entire ***Republican Party***: ""... challenge accepted."" starting think disappointed life Sweden collapsing entirely.

Please resort personal attacks. 

Clearly, what's gone wrong pandemic worsened already fragile healthcare infrastructure around. think I've inconsistent view. needs happen bipartate: 

1. pandemic needs supressed

2. systemic problems weak healthcare system worsened pandemic need addressed. 100% agree. system trying sacrifice teachers baby sitters wage slaves. people perpetuating bullshit murderers far I'm concerned NY something like 50% ICU beds per capita AZ. also harder survive transfer spread states vs go miles. vaccine? even released one yet?

Or taking rantings celebrity medical scientific background seriously?


But '0H nOes, ScIEnTISts toLD EaRtH rOuNd, lOOkS fLat mE, LiEd!'  agree flawed Flair-system, allow one take regional flairs. personal attack get ... living rock? clear trends setting states. decided analyze data try put figure long deaths take follow increase cases. Worldometer seven day moving averages source US numbers.

Texas:

On 6/12 deaths 20. 7/6 figure doubled 40. 6/3 looks like fair starting point increase cases Texas. day cases 1,474. 6/19 approximately doubled 3,074. would imply seen impact cases 6/19, implies delay 19 days.

Florida:

6/17 deaths 31. 55% 48. 6/12 cases 1,355. 6/16 increased 2016. means seeing impact 6/16, delay 22 days.

Let's extrapolate US whole. seeing deaths case count sometime around 6/16-6/19. time, US cases 24k, started increase. are, deaths starting show sign signs increase well.

Feel free correct anywhere I'm wrong, points pretty clear increase coming starting right now. think several; Bars, restaurants, retail shops pretty much business service that's dependent upon people congregating establishment revenue. motivated ignore recommendations protect capital. That's excuse they're doing, explanation remember RFID mark beast. Monster Energy. brain damage, bro true. sad see many LTC homes affected. could done better hopefully patching cracks system it. odds single season (MLB/NHL/NBA) finishes less 5%. Yeah, success countries had, would throw arms go herd immunity ""let run course"" route. seem like thing get contained proper measures. countries largely ignoring like USA, Russia, Brazil getting control, ones actually trying contain pretty successful. seem misunderstand. Ive beating ""this gonna get bad"" drum since wuhan locked down. knew gonna happen however pensing tests positive cases direct indirect circles happened days time. LORD greater space-time dependent dimension need percieve time passing see it, therefore reason pull lives timeline infinitely percieved LORD'S perspective. 

Or, really want know reason, virus stronger victims, LORD made life game survival fittest. died good enough. cruel.  saw incoming disaster state local budgets. figured opening quicker better lockdown forever. that's guess least.

only federal govt borrow money. govt levels facing massive crises. funerals churches? make ton money. Driving city Sunday morning, it’s really telling see churches parking lots full aren’t. parents church still remote services YouTube, they’re gearing start in-person services August 1. actually invested new camera system, they’ll still broadcasting services foreseeable future. Let's hope change much US.  It’s Trump, looking anyone blame himself. leaving trying signal it’s fault. US deaths declining moment. think making statement they're required enough get many people take seriously even without enforcement. yeah, enforcement needed rest folks get board hospital worker, CDC Fauci useless.

So, really speaking outside range here. mask magical barrier protection, point like sure. 

No. angry they're magical barrier *that would want be*. Non-magical *reasonability* enough immature absolutism. hardcore remain electricity shuts down, people can't run A/C anymore. Incorrect. Even hospitals arent full closing ORs. Entire regions close ORs, regardless full individual hospital is. Even dentists ordered close. decision government, hospitals. Killin' _us_, is... Oh no... ever shall do? pray God make enerything better? mean, think ""loving"" God would send us covid, part plan guess... Idk, I've realized long ago understanding God fearing religion impossible. hundreds thousands deaths comment little doomy taste. foresee 3x-ing death count anytime soon present ""hundreds thousands deaths"". problem many protests allowed nothing done stop people get feeling rules enforced unequally bound less following would like take moment remind people crucifixion horrible way die, even Jesus mean cool. Updating knowledge kinda science works. Tax free tithing one hell drug grandmother died COVID. lived 87 fulfilling years. 

I never forget speaking phone last time. could barely hear her, speaking mask. can’t get head died alone hospital. 

Some people might say, “oh, she’s old, doesn’t affect younger people way.” people: True. young people take home loved ones. want guy

You mean good, sensible person? that's doing. Keep dude. World would better people attitude. support mandatory maximum speed limit roads highways 30 mph? not, willing sacrifice tens thousands people year avoid inconveniencing drivers. problem ppl Illinois get restless, travel ""open"" states like Wisconsin, entertainment, bring virus back IL. (seen many FB friends IL actually this. longer friends FB. . . )

It makes economic sense target lockdowns virus is. can't allow ppl freely travel lockdown zones. FWIW, protests attended San Jose near universal mask usage.

I know mask use varies, people arguing BLM protesters generally unmasked full shit. shame see green lines turn red again. US *almost* blew big time far early reopening.

The states still green ones take effective measures. get suffer not. shit lmao  It’s hard get context this. already know guys can’t detect jokes. Let’s rational here. last paragraph. YES. Don’t martyr people. PAY THEM. people want yell responsibility.  

It awful got pregnant 16 decision uninformed think deserve get shit forever one bad decision. 

I suppose understand sometimes people put rough situations crappy outcomes. make bad person. president urging schools reopen. Lol can't wait numbers opens. ""Reddit hates religion"". Shh, said quiet part loud. youve reported, bye ""You full support!"" - Elon Musk. Surely handsome politicians step reduce testing get close arbitrary line. know cutting testing way reduce positives. Suggestion NY: utilize Covid patients need return nursing home setting, still may contagious. Don’t send them
Back nursing home! bubble Let's pack together shelter now. anti-education agenda gone homicide genocide topic Kanye though, need bring Trump. really different posts Elon Musk takes virus reopening? Especially since Elon 100% back according words. Oh look guy! Went restaurant get sick, means they're safe! schools? Wow. 

I work retail home waiting results. Went friend's help pull dumps divorce started show symptoms days saw her. dad, time, test positive. think symptoms (am tired achy stressed Corona?) job like get paid leave, come back til negative hand fourteen days exposure! act though saying two completely contradictory things breath problem people. Young people join military help keep oil prices low, thank service. literally throw parades them.

Young people willing get infected get closer herd immunity, thus protecting elderly people weak immune systems, people flip out. like movie contagion! Yay! hate that. course aren’t. aren’t allowing visitors. People sick enough hospitalized don’t drive themselves.  

I’m sure know that. It’s stupid point. get whole freedom religion thing, fuck churches. I'm getting tired mentally thinking ""Welp. shockedpikachuface applies here"" every third post see sub. think fair say criticize US China response. governments serious issues. also criticize Russia, Brazil UK. could case correlation doesnt always equal causation link show first 1,5 paragraphs article. 

Unfortunately cannot accept something like reliable source It’s personal attack. It’s empirical observation based data gathered months. Feel free adress unless don’t want argue it. girlfriend’s roommate two week road trip California, Colorado Arizona. They’re coming back days I’m sure approach this. don’t think feel need quarantine plan get tested don’t know tell them. 

Do see girlfriend two weeks live quarantine roommate? I’m going comfortable going apartment coming over. would approach this? Without testing people can’t breathe without 100% plus oxygen environments still get ventilators.

Your post makes sense. article explains Latino people getting covid19 more. It’s race causes genetic predisposition already done, I’ve noticing. I’m pretty sure told us it’d cleared Easter. not. talking chaos returning **because pandemic waning**. 

She also talking chaos stands chance spread COVID. clearly related pandemic. news article would exist COVId. go shop riot. Trump rallies churches risky! spread virus! Give break. Let's leave MLB this. Licking hands touching ⚾ gets touched almost every player, coach, umpire fan. Covid19 spread party. CA (most states dont break age, gee wonder why), people 18 younger infection rate .00092% zero deaths. words, they're likely killed car crash way school contracting covid school dying it. panic appropriate. Using blood covered gown treating another patient speaks volumes. want someone else   reading scripture mark beast, conclude real Mark Beast exists red MAGA hat people proudly wear. 3M cases US. article states 650 linked religious facilities. wouldn’t call “major contributor” agree large gatherings places encourage intermingling people discouraged right mean, sounds great know people would licking poles subways deal. joke. Medical leave fully paid work colleagues -eager- catch paid three weeks already. think time goes on, we'll continue seeing Fauci completely wrong many many things. Looking back statements/predictions Feb/March comparing reality, kind sad think was/is considered leading expert infectious diseases. so?

US makes 4% world population 25% confirmed cases, trump supporting friend says ""china probably more"" nothing else. root cause issue lack education US. first world nation acting way scale. Cali isnt far behind.... ahh days Yeah. city closed parks, trails beaches first phase closure. definitely felt way happening. like her, right.  Absolutely science linking children Covid. countries never pulled kids schools fine regard. “Vitale, Cleveland native graduated Hudson High School, represented Ohio's 85th Statehouse district since 2015. running unopposed upcoming November election.” I'd refer data. Looking 7 day average, would appear we're seeing 30% increase deaths, relatively insignificant 200-300% increase cases timeframe suggested. infections Sweden

""After all, takes one unfortunate trade trip Sweden, worst expose dozens people infection."" hardly sports watch. major sports impacted Murdering bitch. Excellent point! *great* Germany that, there've many studies shown made huge difference there. virus mutates though idk herd immunity even possible way covid19 spreads. can't make shit up. Predictable, Christianity death cult. b4 vegans take bait Consequences fun they? hope brother stays safe. DeSantis, however, deserves die alone, slowly painfully. make mistake redditors, despite good news, fact *not* Good News 🇩🇪 🇩🇪 🇩🇪 🇩🇪 teach college. I'm looking looking possibility sacrificing lives loved ones lives educate children.

I'm looking salary. need money would retiring I'm 40. running clinical trial production side side, vaccine works, hit shelves immediately, clinical trial say vaccine work, throw everything away. struggle inanimate objects high. Sigh. mean, we've discussion before: even think poorly sweden compare Russia. Sweden issues, Russia whole league messed imo. guess seem disagree think comparable think that's harsh. 

 best compared Nordics, nothing like kind strain Sweden health care system going crushed curves. Denmark's healthcare system operating normally (probably care debt granted) since mid April example. call chaos.


As call it, well doctor working you? think lying? why? referring ICU admissions, general overall situation hospital. love don’t pay taxes also get strain public health infrastructure.  send kids school! Jesus. mask, face visor, distance slightly can, lots hand sanitizer. exhaustive won’t able guarantee steps 100% work they’re steps take. They're saying wear masks outdoors *when social distancing possible*. Outside might safer inside still bad news someone accidentally spits face (à la ""say spray it"").

The specifics every transmission event known - treat absence case study stand-alone data. like every cold flu.

Common sense get cold, done.

What describing OPPOSITE common sense. something teach people want know. That’s really good way putting it. guess wait week see! don’t understand isn’t news. :/ Positive thinking works human life. But, virus human. Wow... sub painful yeah cities many times state's population. now?  I'm teacher parent. Idk answer either I've got many students grieved last spring school closed. Names faces pass mind right now. went home hunger abuse. Another one mine caught running boyfriend two states away, pregnant (I teach 8th).

Idk answer is. think burden teachers return. many us *willing* return risk kids suffering home. Even suffering home neglected parents work they're ""old enough"" stay home. zero school work got kinds trouble (like getting pregnant 14).

Idk man. I'm trying speak everyone put burden teachers. want back classroom. Outside required NY. can’t 6 feet distancing.  dental bill going suck. take solace lowering death count

Lowering? headline article says HIGHEST daily amount. need room? possible, stay different room talk cellphone. long room breathing other's droplets, risk low. Take care. goofball Anakin! Chancellor evil! Sri Petaling Cluster mosque spreading started right? That's good know. Let's hope recoveries soon! Damn straight, never understood need going church, go years, maybe decade Places like Canada provinces reporting 10 cases day consider reopening schools. 

Places like United States states reporting 10,000 new cases day not. study THC though opposite problem. Apparently, I'm people may refer pinhead!

I ordered child sized mask. See works. stuff big boy masks full filter material point I'm almost passing out.

Yo! Anyone US got deets masks fucking pinheads? need help here!! virus 7. Encephalomyelitis due high fever. relearn walk didnt recover physically twenties. Socially, I’m pretty sure I’m still inept. virus. “Silly” concerned death rates instead case numbers sickness vast majority experience mild symptoms from?

Smh usual, people taking simplistic, binary approach this. might time go. might time get it, spread friends family, put ventilator weeks, spend next several months even years still suffering symptoms watch loved ones die. But, yeah, masks hard. don’t care people dying? punishement requires irrefutable evidence originated China. that, then? 
 
And, pray tell, many times evidence nations breaking, say, Geneva Convention? many trials convictions contrast? Buckle cause aren’t even protests yet

We seeing cases protests starting May 26th? “Smoke two joints morning...” Even then, US bashing aside, US way higher standard living India Brazil, agree government incompetent, one's disputing that

Also, compare US's standard living say Angola Somalia, third world country

I'm american, observations check data Kids might okay view, adults near get sick could cause shitshow. wait till winter season comes, it’s going rough end year. stick 5-minute crafts. Sorry. MMA going months, golf, hockey likely safe Canada. would probably go like cop writing speeding ticket, ticket running stop sign.


Most people apologize attempt comply, others act like bitchy Karen's. Try green dragon, decarb weed, soak high proof alcohol week two, done. Keeps forever fridge, simple measure dose small measuring spoons goes easy. Explicit rules governing social behavior, order keep people alive, pretty much entire story Moses. haven’t wearing mask entire life point? disappeared 1930, even time doctors weren’t sure make it. Yeah even heavily encouraged wear mask near start pandemic, barely anyone wearing one. want boost economy maybe encourage give funding businesses work remotely. I'm currently stuck city, I've graduated job. would anything opportunity work remotely eorry future rent. I'm going able afford rent let alone fucking meal restaurant! Let god sort out. 7 billion would accept it. I'm sorry, South Carolina unUnited States Yeah, Norway importing swedish doctors nurses certainly affected either :) 

But hey, good news - ICU patients covid 92 - first time since March 100, considering drop positive tests hospitalizations, seems healthcare hopefully time relax breathe quite soon. Forbidden travel stopped trump loving neighbor multiple trips Cabo. asshat, month half ago protesting lockdown insisting everyone get back work. He's Mexico vacationing since early June employees risk pay bills. Södermanland 3 patients ICU patients. top 37 patients mid April. call chaos. contrast countries like e.g. Russia chaos. E.g. ""‘Worse Prison’"" : ""hospital Lenexpo: patients dream escaping there, call prison... ceiling collapsed there""

The fire started ventilators: forget memory list medical workers Russia, +560 names now. chaos. Yet another datapoint 'Sweden's testing apparatus snuff' column. Well, good news region making right call prioritize PCR time being. limited resources, makes sense way.  Yeah, lunchlady wage-slave trying keep roof kids’ heads $8 hour, Jeff Bezos demands expose virus among asymptomatic children! We’re going hit 4 million late August, that. Yeah, it’s always “muh two weeks” people, isn’t it? US UK best guess given miles instead kilometres Winnipeg generally ragged players place nothing spare time. Generally curious - teachers strike large (easier said done, know)? totally understand parents extremely disrupted right now, feel like unfair parents, defenseless kids going environment they're going get sick continue spread virus. Hmm Az death rate increasing. COVID deniers saying “well even though cases hospitalizations up, least death rate low”. 

Looking like catching “deaths lag” point. 

Gosh, warning?! Go strike Oh really? go? CBD still trigger anxiety psychosis symptoms people sensitive THC. Indeed. Yeah they're special kind ignorant. Praying home obviously effect church. God listens focal points filled brim people singing praising name. fickle shit he?  effective verse mutated strains? get point, taking care kids (which didn’t till 35) hardest thing I’ve done, way harder stressful job. I’m child zero responsibilities growing up, can’t identify people grew raise siblings. case extreme many responsibilities, case extreme none. families achieve balance kids don’t feel burden also chip balanced amount responsibility. don’t think large families expect older kids take disproportionate amount work, I’m sorry deprived care free childhood, really sucks. would go literally everything saying right would admitting wrong. I've given hope Trump right thing waiting election. going work.  Many would likely better dead left hook 3-4 weeks intensive care bills.

U-S-A! U-S-A! #Translation: 

Western Sweden. Västra Götaland region plans offer antibody tests inhabitants autumn. write press release testing likely start September.


At present, private individuals Västra Götaland test via health centers so-called PCR test. PCR tests taken stick nose throat. tests show ongoing infection.


The reason antibody tests delayed want ""build robust organization around tests"".


- **We believe priority stop spread infection breaking chain infection. put limited resources summer period find ongoing infection thus risk infecting others**, says Jan Kilhamn, Chief Staff Regional Special Health Management press release.

#Need increase capacity


At present, VGR tests 2,000 people antibodies. meet public's high demand antibody testing, capacity needs increase. expected September, VGR estimates.


Exactly tests start offered yet decided. cost SEK 160 public cost healthcare personnel. hotel quarantine Australia. Hotel staff don’t deal people quarantine, army prison service manages them. can’t expect hotel staff deal it, would disaster. Jesus Christ Superspreader! dont want second wave better build immunity now. likely Oxford vaccine fail means vaccine till next year best. build immunity decided stay lockdown indefinitely. Shutdowns harmful. stop person person contact, interrupts spread virus.


The problem businesses equipped police customers act like Karen's, violent douchebags.

Masks pushed earlier, medical professionals scientists going suggest something tested use outside scenarios tested for.

People preached proper reopening procedures, allowed rely flat Earthers Facebook advice.


Local governments passing laws teeth, recommendations. Police enforce laws. Especially crackdown first weeks, people get point bullshit tolerated.

Government buildings get strict controls. Courthouses, libraries, schools, etc... 

Public buildings supported tax dollars similar controls. 

Make young kids wear masks also. Preschoolers love dress Halloween. bringing everywhere anyway, hour store hurt them.


Zero tolerance comes people ignoring ""suggestions"" bullying store employees jobs trying follow rules. Store employees police, police need called, arrest troublemakers. He's hoping God fulfill plan spreading coronavirus kill disbelievers. non-americans stop using site subreddit, give listen America doing. Got it. Thanks. FuCkEd

-Churches

Guys, think see problem. Well viruses without vaccines eventually get R0. didnt see single mask traveling alabama Didn’t mention masks. Lockdowns complete overreaction. ICU numbers high elective surgeries shut down. virus fear mongering. serious? Yes, protect elderly stop fucking younger people’s lives. I’m mass people living pipe dream. work manual labor nobody wears masks really cares. got lucky, virus returns screwed guy work Costco Trader Joe’s wonder drop deaths Sweeen stopped practices actively euthanizing elderly denying oxygen treatment?

It's shameful Sweden done... China 7 cases yesterday. South Korea 44. Despite exponentially larger population spread across exponentially larger area, China managing control virus effectively S. Korea. see hard people believe. 

From experience China, country allowing manage virus effectively. easy solve. Part religion worship direct personal interaction congregation, minister, hearing word, many affirming community touch. listed constitute experiencing God, many. Without interaction loss spiritual connection church corporate body suffer people become dis hardened disinterested.

I blame churches (not fair round generalization btw) wanting get back running. blame taking measures COVID19 safe. Prayer prevent transmission. Prevention precaution will. Maybe that’s needed closed first place. rewatched jersey shore first time like five years. They’ve always probably needed face masks tbh That's good post. lot people simply think made severe numbers conflict that...so ignore them.

I say numbers holiday weekend tough interpret could backlog, even couple days worth...it's good. starting see governors check shifting decisions cities counties. Passing buck become standard operating procedure prestigious leadership. number actual infections almost certainly peaked peak deaths. That's logical. number verified infections may peaked month ago, testing capacity likely much higher level then. Thousands low wage works leave enter bubble every day would cost much make real bubble.

Its bubble, lie. Florida poised become 14th state enter 1% club today (that one percent population confirmed infected) Georgia heels joining days. That's American dream. Screw you, got mine. president Putin, said act immediately. say this. see reason would act immediately. It’s one guy rest line behind like stupid fucks

That’s don’t like saying rep dem. People buy stop thinking Oh well that's okay then. accident I'll sure tell ambulance driver take ones Come on, rookie numbers, get 100,000 day, know it. USA, USA, USA, USA!

/s don’t realize it. need one good sharpie re-route hurricane, silly. remains seen... yesterday high, we’ll see delay weekend. large group standing place, indoors singing least hour sounds like worst environment transmission never said agreed it. I’m side don’t think joking I’m simply stating joke. think empathy bred using anecdote make people feel bad opinion? never said anything children dying. fuck losing child teen mother? way linked. Every age person lose child, one go it. Please explain tied making good decisions sex contraception. weird me. I'm Perth, Aus church family goes gone online. They've actually expanded services streaming mass every day alongside in-person ones weekends mornings.

If want attend mass television/facebook/livestream. really need holy bread head weekends strict limit number people allowed inside observed. need call ahead book want able get inside. 

All feels really weird me. Things arent, won’t long time, fine. 

But Sweden seems making progress last. R seems around 0,75, testing scaled seems work (got tested within 24 hours booking answer took 5 days weekend between), cases dropping positivity are, according public health agency, also dropping. Last number saw 10% (which way high), report soon week 27. Hospital ICU admissions down, right 92 patients getting intensive care Sweden Covid-19. Severe cases general down. 

Why happening? idea, shit show lots political bickering, local authorities covering statistics deaths several municipals, politicans hiding behind public health agency, stockpiles medical supplies, investigations too,narrow triage hospitals, complete exposure lacking care sick och elderly, coherent strategy authorities, vague recommendations, slow responses almost everything could go on.

The hope drops manageble level mid August regions start robust test-trace-isolate zoning like almost nations have. wouldnt bet happening though. CDC says cases 10 times higher:

[CDC says COVID-19 cases U.S. may 10 times higher - June ""Our best estimate right every case that's reported, actually 10 infections,"" Dr. Robert Redfield, director CDC, said call reporters Thursday. might lead new field evolutionary biology: Social Selection. He's told lies facts matter, imo. Someone posted FB wall need come back something, he’s typical anti masker.... respond this


quick mafs, 

I’ll break 3 percentages ya, 

Canada: population 37,950,000 people
Confirmed cases : 106K
Deaths : 8706 

That’s 8.6% death rate infected vs dead 

Or 0.02% death rate vs pop Canada , 

USA: population 331M 
Total cases : 3.03M
Deaths: 133K 

4.3% death rate vs infected 
Or 
0.04% death rate VS population 

Global: 
Population: 7.8B
Confirmed cases: 11.6M 
Deaths: 539K 

4.6% death rate infected vs deaths 
Or
0.006% death rate VS population earth ,

Now also take consideration Toronto public health, OPENLY stated tested posstive died recorded covid death even death wasn’t caused covid, 

So they’re basically saying could drive local hospital test positive covid, Jump car get fucking smoked head transport die instantly, STILL mark death covid related goes covid deaths global/county, 

That’s pretty fucking miss leading no? 

The CDC openly admitted virus HIGHLY unlikely spread via asymptomatic people. 

There hospitals USA OPENLY admitted record deaths covid pay out, 

There ALSO nurses across USA suspicious tests , 10 nurses started sending UN OPENED tests get tested falsely wrote made people’s names them, would come back positive, 

Now jump throat, I’m saying covid ISNT real. projection called virus blown precaution it’s disgusting. 

Need also remind good chunk “ covid “ deaths old folks home ? hate insensitive guy, covid not, people likely last days is, bet half people died natural causes still “tested positive “ therefore still marked covid death. 

The media politicians literally population wrapped around finger. literally worlds population scared whatever say do, do. Masks? Sure. Wait till see thats next. Soon they’ll regulating times aloud leave house ( like what’s going Columbia rn ) failure result fines. 

It’s sad. sad, 

If virus wiping even 1% earths 7.8B population, could justify measures taking currently. 

Statistically common flu pneumonia wiped earths population 6month span covid has, Uhmm..no thank you, hope many Brits said nope! Hey spam bruh. latest news tells people maintain safety knowing developments. Stupid  No, chaos apparently according doctor suppressed due pandemic, back **due changesin pandemic** worried may cause infection spread. 

I think one engaging borderline misinformation here, rather inability see said trending direciton. “Stupid shit”?! Imagine much money guy making right now? Sure he’s risking catching maybe dying- long stays alive he’s making way money Thats pretty much post indicating. Let’s let one play out.... It’s almost like Reddit American website. It’s almost like America affected virus due shitty response. 1 every 6 global coronavirus deaths currently America. bout protests though care either. family member dies they'll get upset, then, need free daycare seems legit. death reporting stats seem lag lot takes time states report someone dies. So, things play:

\-Test results take 6-10 days states. 
\-Once someone positive, take 1-2 weeks they're hospitalized. 
\-Once hospitalized, take anywhere 1-4+ weeks die. 
\-Once someone dies, take anywhere days weeks county/state report number. 
\-And then, people never got tested die covid.

Allegheny County PA reported 6 deaths happened April June.

I know live statistically driven society...but stats certainly nowhere near realtime. lack stats seem false complacency may reported yet. don’t understand article comments. get ELI5? He's trolling. Nowhere near enough cases CA, let alone year old demographic infer stat precision. sub full people downplaying pandemic bullshit numbers like that. Hey, I'm Sweden. We've still got highest rate infection Europe there's scaremongering wearing masks encouragement wear them, authorities less

I fear us Fall Winter people flock in-door restaurants malls schools open. without masks test, trace isolate. family member sick confirmed COVID we're told authorities keep working get symptoms, asymptomatic spread disregarded. Again, without masks course. course, would assume US citizens getting 100% vaccines produced though? Dont forget claiming relief money that's intended small business! restaurants stopped takeaway orders reopening. Pretty good piece part CJC's ongoing coverage coverage Coronavirus, winding trajectory masks prophylactic unfortunate political symbol . longish feeling piece even totally word count makes novel arguments. there's passage recommend reading follows Expertise, many news organizations felt, defended bad-faith attacks. press got slow down.

Rather rush toward facile answers simplistic assertions, stories must reveal profound complexity problems hand. must humble.That may feel counterintuitive, given immediacy pandemic, centrality lives, need know much get back normal. It’s press’s job, part, bring responsible sense urgency collective quest greater knowledge—including whether masks worn. work cannot done responsibly don’t take time ask essential questions open every possible window understanding. coverage vital public health information truthful unless it’s patient.

 I've supplied every piece information subject matter.
 Sadly I've even stop talking relatives reason, including her.

 hope get someone family sick.

 lead horse water...

You know rest  eager reopen want money I'm starting think lot stories exactly true aimed divisive. like lot stuff reddit recently. Rename church services ‘Celebrations Protest’. Problem solved, NYT media outlets said protests/riots beginning June contribute increase COVID19 cases. Functional alcoholism gluttony frequently treated far less seriously actually are. wonder heart disease literally number one. course churches eager reopen. mean ignoring recommendations reopening, though. sources statistics published percentage churches reopened? even possible track such? churches (southern) state *not* regathered person. financial difficulty this, eager work local government part slow spread virus. Churches regathered minority *not* viewed positive light churches responsible.

So business? rely customers? profit motive Trumping safety wellbeing communities?

Understood. region made 17964 PCR tests 3121 antibody tests last week. Pretty good scale even though problems. Yeah one party thinks deal ignoring hoping disappear expense actual human lives, think know party is. don’t understand folks look say “ah yes. death rate acceptable.” part god's plan. god horrible planner? get downvoted it.

Damn murricans  Thank you, Kenya, right thing. heard Venmo lol Someone Twitter went route. majority deaths underlying conditions probably would died anyway. many could prevented people stayed home get beer bar? course does. Saying stuff like incredibly harmful.

Yes, chance get infected even though keep distance, risk heavily minimised. really dont get would anti mask. proper masks buy even wanted could use algoritm predict next hotspots. Neat. that's public access bet. Damn really honestly seriously depressing. understand going on. economically motivated, why? money makes powerful, gives power what? We're making mess world, deforesting millions acres hamburger farming, allowing wealth become super-concentrated. Why, man? resources create beautiful utopia shared wealth affordable housing cool jobs keep voting morons stuck 1955. Yep, one people going set foot school Fucking good. People need wear masks. Anything reduce viral transmission step right direction. I'm Covid denier.

But ""open outside"" train.

Because life least year. Maybe three. Maybe forever.

The risk much smaller outdoors. 

We seen plenty huge outdoor events turn mass spreader events. 

\---

\`No new COVID-19 cases Lake Ozarks crowds, Missouri health director 318 outbreaks China found transmission occurred out-of-doors bars churches mass spreader events. 


It's still debated outdoors ""extremely safe"" ""safer"" either case harm reduction.

If want avoid fatigue setting avoid people going house parties visiting friends home, need give outdoor spaces. Unless we're willing go full police state force people homes, outdoors much much safer option. Even bible wants stay home pray, like hypocrites, love pray standing synagogues street corners seen others. Truly tell you, received reward full. pray, go room, close door pray Father, unseen. Father, sees done secret, reward you. I’m social worker work mental health crisis response teams. don’t option staying home. Sorry everyone job home. nyc 16 covid deaths among kids within 3 month period year, that's 48 full year

try Wow, country gets upset one death due unjust causes.  world okay hundreds people day?  

Your point view crazy me. Even better, skip worshipping save brain well. Cashing final elderly clergy, know they're getting whatever's wills parishioners. There’s lot confusion among people, misinformation, surrounding face masks. discuss masks important someone who’s infected prevent infecting someone else… Right United States, people walking around You’re sure it? people listening really closely …There’s reason walking around mask. you’re middle outbreak, wearing mask might make people feel little bit better might even block droplet, it’s providing perfect protection people think is. And, often, unintended consequences — people keep fiddling mask keep touching get schmutz, sort staying inside course, course. But, think masks, think health care providers needing people ill. people who, look films foreign countries see 85% people wearing masks — that’s fine, that’s fine. I’m it. want it, that’s lead shortage Exactly, that’s point. could lead shortage masks people really need it.

That's far cry Fauci claiming masks work. Keep mind realized many asymptomatic cases are, far less reason people show symptoms wearing them. large amount asymptomatic people became clear April time CDC changed guidance recommend everyone wear mask. husband volunteers youth group local church resuming services next week... 100+ kids weekly. requiring masks, two first services offering dinner... wtf. let know going. disappointed. California. fair, car seats designed protect children within certain window size, whereas actual seats made anyone 80-500+ lbs. small, used seat belt adjuster, would fine- refuses use one. That’s already happening say death rate low, comparable flu. move goal posts saying “over 300,000 people die nursing homes don’t shut economy that.” favorite date, “Governor wolf PA shut PA pass minimum wage increase,” in, think governor doesn’t think virus bad, he’s pretending it’s bad advance political agenda. I’m told I’m open enough perspectives say insanity. think ""living fear""? measures followed reduce spread. reduce spread, ICUs fill people start dying large numbers...

Are saying wearing mask ""living fear""? think DisneyWorld opening... really wish covid19 selective lethality. going church time, deserve see afterworld faster others. entire point operation warp speed millions doses ready day trials finish. can’t start buying doses trials even lunch yet, damn CDC estimates infection rates 10x higher number confirmed cases. So, like, air conditioned hallway Apartment building? someone virus, coughs hallway, go minutes later, get sick? plenty cloth masks go around, fact prevent spreading covid. looks like using data rt.live seems little absurd me, sites Rt value much lower NJ. agree creating mandates based algorithm couple guys wrote. cases hospitalizations still decreasing know Rt value calculated going up. congregations soon pockets herd immunity.

-Charles Darwin That’s interesting. I’m doubting you, research/articles? I’d really like read that! water seeks level. ....which different number guy cited. 

Moreover, CDC numbers comes now-outdated studies (there's testing months ago, drives ratio). 

Basically, know, number changes anyway different different places (it's probably going way Arizona, example running low testing positivity rate going way up). course. isn’t communist Russia. get hospitalized, get 6-figure bill facility...like real American. article talks general problem people going A&amp;E seeking help non-emergency issues instead first contacting nurse husläkare... 

In Sweden should, non-Emergency, always first gå Vårdcentral (in normal times) contact (especially now). article talks problems Swedish (and countries') emergency rooms have, people get A&amp;E minor injuries. catchup weekend holiday one's saying post vote non-american articles majority audience american america one affected countries virus expect see lot USA based posts. agree completely. I'd participate. Teachers played huge role helping get Whitmer elected, knows it. studied modelling shows - 95% confidence level - downward trend COVID-19 statistically significant - words, numbers dropped significantly since peak infection. SHAMEFUL!!!! I’m US, also acquired narcolepsy around time swine flu vaccine many countries even US states done utterly stomp outbreak keep cheap tactics like test, trace, isolate woke populace using masks common sense.

Or shut down, open up, shut open suffering deaths, disabilites rampant unemployment recession. 

Better yet, could done several Asian countries taken early measures hardly outbreak all. Trump GOP trusted virus would ""go away like magic"". TF ""we""? power order quarantine infected, mandate mask wearing, jail fail comply.

The government act. Specifically, people power act must act. choose political reasons.

If country believed principles says does, lot people go gibbet this. negligence, premeditated. feasible exhaust intake system? mean would want oven temperature air blown rather contaminated air blown fresh clean air brought in? hate people. Using holiday reported deaths. Telling people 80 risk extremely low. Pure fucking evil. nant people go around talking like didnt die basically asymptomatic... cringe f* religion bad 650 cases 40 locations major source?

Wear fuckin mask? Nah, that's oppressive.


Hey, covid shit getting pretty bad. Make lock again? funny, back school shppping do. Apparently much sense elderly parents do. I’ve pressured groceries delivered pick refuse it. Dont edit titles kidding me? Taking care kids priority. take care them, work. ensure succeed, need schooling socialization. wife work provide. also teach?

Please, think someone else’s situation. nuanced issue. easy say “they don’t care kids.” sorry afforded chance work remotely. business responsibilities me, team, department cannot perform remotely. Danke insight! Agreed: basically nowhere perfect response. German one ts flaws rightly pointed out. Another one outbreak meatpacking factory due poor conditions. likely more. 

But say ""We’re obsessed rules..."" hey *helps lot* situation like overall! antibodies reporting found likely able used building blocks vaccine. shifted death rates low New York's single day High Score 11,600.

I’m PA it’s nowhere near bad states anyway, it’s nice they’re taking seriously. mean anyone thought wasn’t going happen, either lying stupid Must post wall comment removed. still haven’t even considered possibility we’ve perma-fukt ourselves. It’s entirely possible way achieve long term immunity. could Covid stay mutate decades centuries. could life now. Instead considering fact life never same, without vaccine, people desperately trying cling past. That's terrible. solution send prayers.  god obv. US: We're worst public health fuckups world!

UK: Hold pint. chips. pub. Without mask. Unfortunately case quite work way. least right away. still get COVID19 corpse. place packed morons lmao Like Jesus, like, Korean. Yes - so? I'm misanthrope. protestors have, large, wearing masks, sharing food/drink, limiting physical contact can. churches following safety guidelines, cases spiking protestors' aren't. Quiet peasants! 

NBA, Disney, Cruise Industry need make money! glad hear this. spend next years paying damn medical bill. ""natural"". 


Yeah Karen, right. However, lot natural things still kill though. Could link study then? I'm honestly interested.

I still find earlier comment harmful, keeping distance shown easily implementable way fight virus. entirely effective, still major factor successful strategy.

Saying matter lead people trust anything else say, since proven effect. push tenured teachers high pay scale. mom 25 years experience masters education tenure. Ever since Rick Scott pay gone $20k+ new teachers less $10k more. expensive keep experienced educated teachers revolving door college graduates degree basket weaving? they've gotten rid tenure whatever want them. Got many raises? fired. want work overtime without pay? Fired.  Already started... Going 2000 3121 isn’t increase? shows less next week talk it. That's never stopped before. Trickle work. Drug testing welfare work. Pray gay away work. GOP death cult. someone could seen coming find source Linde's claims thread. Go watch video, quite clear said. Yeah, read Leviticus long ago. said quarantine 7 days first still showing symptoms need quarantine another 7 days. 

In words, quarantine considered biblical. lately? I’m lab reg tech let tell you, processed covid tests within past two weeks now. still behind 20k tests need processed. bad. would like hear emergency room doctor COVID-19? Obviously we're relatively informed we're sub, questions answered news articles like know? I'm interviewing doctor podcast trying gather questions. Yeah, Sweden made non-political decision handling virus. fair three low days back back. assume reporting lagging due 3rd July holiday. fully expecting today's numbers higher usual.

Perhaps fit narrative though. flu dork co-wrote article need mass testing reopen safely. titled it, (“Population Testing Thoughts wish didn’t apply literally. :( way still missing 90%+ cases. clearly time traveler. interesting, thanks pointing out. every study says children aren’t big vector covid base conclusions testing data.

This big one. mention schools daycares closed past months. seems kids likely come contact many people even true low spread among children may places children go closed. scary thing is, even watching parent's church, super careful following rules, mandatory masks, congregating afterwards, limits attendance, etc, almost people show super risk elderly wish alter stark reality cases rapidly increasing, threatens hospital capacity American lives. need alternative truths.

They liars, deceivers, truth them.

Americans die greedy selfish cruelty, do? Try deceive. Understood, thank you. I'm sure would replace teachers strike. firing public school teachers would great move politically publicly (at least half country - half state)  Florida tends report cases per day, 11am. likely add tomorrow. Hello name NINOOOOO Nooo shit Somebody forgot mention axis they’re supposed flatten. Straight supposed work. Yes that’s say.

But land free home brave privacy important public health.

Unless can’t opt it’s fruitless. 

It’s nothing kind situation.

Contact tracing works people answer phone land telemarketing spam calls never happen. unless guys get caller ID labeled contact tracing something less spammy number I’ve never seen before.

The United States current status directly proves contact tracing might help, mask wearing much effective. 

Like mask wearing, contact tracing beneficial everybody gets board.

We way past point contact tracing helpful. realise. Avg death occurs 22 28 days infection. Add 7 days lag death reported death. That's full month infection reported death Hahahah people sub chew bullshit facts Stay topic please Dear Coronavirus,

Fuck you. go mega church Texas. opened 3 properly socially distanced Sunday services closing due cases getting worse (they made decision themselves). I'm pretty sure still services online though Nothing ""seems plausible"" zero information judge by.

You may end right, may end wrong, neither future options make statement moment informed. comment section Facebook worst place ever. Seriously? 

I can’t even name actual boxer days. seen single infection neighboring cities 3 months. there's curve flatten.

And simply time offer takeaway, restaurant full. offered takeaway option due COVID-19. avoiding Asbury right now...makes sad,though. Add that, visitors leaving DisneyWorld take home lethal souvenirs. part god's plan, according them.  Yes, true.

It false choice, sad result hyper partisan American political system. lack real leadership made much much worse.

The truth safe economy America stop pandemic first. cannot successfuly re-open economy unless virus brought control.

Refusing realistic lockdown re-opening hurry, slowed economic damage, made worse.

Europe correctly, USA created real problem itself. Yes, definitely. However, Nick wife huge health well-being. least knew afar (obviously know person). Even taking scroll Amanda's instagram, see happy healthy couple Nick were. seemed blissfully happy. kidding me? Please take 5 minutes day research brutal disease it. People needinh multiple limp amputations, lung damage point dying waiting transplant, serious brain damage, shit basically destroys whole body starves oxygen. fucking awful disease survive even unpleasant die (alone, nobody visit you. foam.) Colorado also bottom 1/3 nation new cases continues trending down. That's fine. ever cared money anyways. guy Facebook said otherwise also told trust I’m gonna stick it’s 5G conspiracy get Obama back office nothing else convince otherwise  today's churches still rely donations service?  FL reports day. rest week veye interesting tho virus can't survive 140F, need really crank global warming. interesting down-voted almost quickly up-voted. Hitting refresh every often 258, 261, 257, 259, 254, etc.  650 cases 40 locations past month. 650 cases compared tens thousands getting single day Dont know churches work US canada far im concerned like catholic churches. register online attend. Seating limited. pews seperated 6 ft apart. Mask mandatory enter. Percent positive seems stabilized 14-16% range, good, although stabilizing 10k cases day good. 

&amp;#x200B;

Florida closed bars late June, wonder seeing effects now. Bars seem like worst possible place every measure control window, people drunk even think virus. I'm also Virginia confirm well!!! Major retailers hope also helping offering free masks door, would cut profit margins.. We're officially diverting again. started Monday evening we're still diverting.

We waiting list beds now.

And we're difficulty finding enough staff grow new beds we've added. reminds day, beginning confinement Spain, go Madrid collect documents office. 20 minutes saw 4 pairs ambulances, lights sirens on. say pairs went pairs, police bikes escorting. Except that, city deserted. strange chilling. I'm sure never seen before, hope see again. I'm aware. many people try poke holes something can't proven simply accept gloss fact making joke current situation better. think may case correlation causation. What? source that? thousands dead lack trust authorities compared Denmark, Norway Finland. 

Their approach failed horribly. virus might burn out, literally sacrificed thousands elderly people benefit distraught finally gave let Israelites go.

And even then, change heart shortly afterwards, proving human stubbornness stupidity limited era. look way funding meant small businesses distributed clear COVID another excuse distribute welfare rich  riots Covid free huh? Fuck guy. Stop buying products. Desantis crew someone else blame. pesky non residents trying hide tourism state. much pre-symptomatic spread taking fairly long time kill (with treatment), would even matter much became deadlier long happened later, severe stages? Though guess still evolutionarily advantageous unless also contagious well. point, current US epicenters first epicenters US. northeast going months ago rest country learn/take seriously. like affecting foreign countries (out site, mind?), already hit parts US hard people STILL refuse accept reality COVID. 

This makes even madder. shuddered reading description, also kind want hear it?? Except Costco beat someone throw are, learning foreign language without face-to-face teacher possible, standard adult learners work children too, especially (and key part) alternative risk health even life. easy decision. Yes, people tell turn vote, gap popular vote electoral college vote.

It'll really fun next 4 years Trump wins 25% popular vote.

System broke AF. church parents go insane. 

My gf's church exact opposite. pastor closed live services early March (they already streaming) explained around Memorial Day understood people felt strongly it, opening doors ""anytime soon"". pressure would make country great Tbf, really don’t think pediatricians voice call times. vested interest health children (physical, emotional, mental); however, don’t know schools like impacts teachers/staff. I’m sure kids’ mental health suffer teacher dies COVID take virus home kills grandma. Accelerating bigly US stock market, though? Hmmm? .8% around correct rate death Yup, towards middle May seemed every post people calling everyone Doomers.

I seen anyone even say word weeks. Tots pears It’s dirtiest business. populations key election fall. That's Republican freedom ya! Sanctions international court like user replied suggested.
 
Sanctions could happen, still need solid case. Otherwise, happens evidence contrary shows up? 
 
And seeing West's economies entangled China's, tricky. lot easier country like Iran NK.
 
I think companies might start moving China, happen money's good. Thank you.

I disagree. still helpful, necessarily enough. still limit spread. nothing.

Reading article, think authorities rethink recommendations though.  “We 50 cases USA another 70-80 cruises “ 120-130 cases USA sir ? it’s 50 rest boat dock happens usa 

Following playbook potus article specifically discusses problems sweden hospital system **direct result** coronavirus pandemic. source? that's true that's really good news (I thought number way lower date end 2020). Oh, will. Thanks :D guess became successful, moved better neighborhood, lot black Hispanics friends (especially poor), became harder dissociate human beings easier make generalized judgement whole group based actions individuals. stories former racists same, moved new place, met learned one's life story realized told wrong. Thank input. im sure protests not! continued flights china! Yeah, were, think would skipped 2020 Elon Musk, much shit is, actually accomplished something useful world. March said wait 2 weeks Florida fall didn’t stop spring break. Nothing. April said wait 2 weeks opening beaches again. Nothing. May said wait 2 weeks Florida decided end lockdown. Nothing.

It wasn’t mass protests happening streets, taking news cycle, cases started finally spike Florida around country (but you’ll hear ones key Trump’s loss November). doomers saying right, rejoicing people getting sick, claiming past 6 weeks “just wait 2 weeks deaths spike well”. Yep, see becoming new seasonal flu common cold deadly. FL posts day make sense, I'm going argue restaurants area. local restaurants give shit flattening curve supporting them? docs.google.com may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage, post automatically removed. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

Is me, sounds like really low number? context 50K cases day feel like headline say ""Churches rushing reopen safely"".

I'm churches taking extra precautions lots comments mention terrible stuff, came looking see 10's thousands infected churches, several hundred. 650 cases ""a major sources coronavirus cases"" popularized form deception lies them. produce outrageous statement. go well, joke. get enough pushback, posts moves extreme tactic repeats.

Recognize deception, one ideals. Tsunami's much better waves /s florida full retiement communities? trying keep virus away No. credits due scientists. Oh, totally. contract still supplies us sick bank. teachers month going chew throigh that. sub shortage compounding serious everywhere. crazy situation.

My prediction (not if) first teacher district dies, serious collapse. able remain open even wanted to. is, multipel articles talking staff burning out. + holiday season = maybe see less soon. Unless training new people, case that's great. seen tell specifically re: testing, nurses, etc. maybe also lab techs well. one talking protesting? guess it’s okay protest riot social distance Eat long pig instead. guy font wisdom insight. Agreed. know going happen, police (who protective gear, training, ability arrest people) ones dealing them. Retail workers already enough plates dealing idiots, they're high risk getting covid, need another thing deal with. Imagine spending significant portion life studying epidemiology, time could arguably applicable entire career occurs.

And people disregard everything say despite clear scientific background like hearing it. study, scientists investigated durability tiny, respirable SARS-CoV-2 aerosols determine deteriorate become less infectious 16 hours, remain stable. **To conduct experiment, researchers sprayed viral aerosols slowly churning aerosol chamber suspended 16 hours, continuously monitoring changes taking place.** Agreed. similar situation. Refreshing know others there. parents bit older don’t want risk getting sick babysit.

We 5 year old, 2 year old, two working parents. Lucky enough work home. experience remote learning crap frustrating best. devote time homeschooling can, it’s without socialization. can’t work/teach time mine wife’s jobs. Would rather pull homeschool full time rather deal distance learning garbage again. good situation real stressful. Hence sensible re-opening plan would wonders us. watched video say anything antibody tests Västra Götaland. care. taking life easy, you? asthma definitely feel thinness air airplanes get cruising altitude (they usually pressurized 8,000 feet) start needing breathe more. Stay safe! really understand makes confident rising case numbers big deal, especially acknowledge long term effects well understood. Many people may need hospitalized, mean quality life severely impacted, time infection long-term. even evidence lung occlusion asymptomatic cases. People needing dialysis acute kidney failure well. dont know bad might yet. 

For SARS, cousin COVID, well documented negative long term health effects (reduced lung capacity, bone damage steroid treatment, post viral fatigue sydrome) high proportion survivors. COVID seem much milder illness, lot doctors reason believe similar effects might befall survivors illness. 

Plus, sheer mathematics. cases rise, healthcare situation deteriorates people need intensive care, even proportion hospitalizations remains same. People sick also can't work (or least habe to) thus lot productivity lost. makes life worse everybody. really good lot people sick spreading disease well understood, even death sentence most. Darwinism. Jesus didn’t ask lol Honestly, deaths spike spike. really matter when. really matters need stop spread virus period. Nope. rational. I’ll put way. see article subreddit go, hey, think I’m going let trump everything else I’ve heard, limited personally knowing people virus. 

But I’ll assume comment isn’t completely irrational. What’s asinine comment? Im asking rhetorically. co-workers area saying April 'whats problem? like 200 cases dude' locked month. like ... Yeah... locked down... Avoid reposting information editing titles. link then? almost definitely Melbourne, Australia stores area (county Calfornia masks mandated) even employee asking people wear mask. fair amount stores, including Post Office, even sign says Masks Required. includes chain stores like Home Depot, Walmart, CVS pharmacy, Tru-value hardware stores, Papa Murphy's, etc. true PCR without symptoms. Please link source claiming case, since changed. 

What Linde said everyone Sweden could get tested regardless symptoms. even getting AB test symptoms ... wait infection Challenge courts unfortunately thrown people point mandates polio pre-vaccine, measles pre-vaccine, etc. etc. etc.

I'm sorry: disease kills 1/1000 compared 1/10 1/12 two viruses specifically mentioned pre-vaccine? mandate infirm legal ground things stand courts today.

By way: wear mask would support mandate... laws way today previous 'stare decisis' courts? going happen. Aerosol regular air. 

The article sensational Yeah small groups gathering church....not massive city wide riots... pathetic. Ignoring real cause persecuting peaceful religious people would good Mel Brooks movie.  gonna say, ""people begin moving indoors"" what? huge portions country 90+ degrees summer 2 week period nice weather fall followed 35 rainy, People live dont go outside, pretty much ever. Even weather nice outdoor activities fucking awful outside 90% year. Yes confirmed. usa amount testing italy(proportionally) would go probably 5 making death rate even unlikely truthful US Almost like vast majority religious buildings country churches. Funny works social/emotional risks huge longer kids can't socialize.

But makes sense me. Kids wont socializing sitting desk room 5-6 hours, mask on, students room want comply 6ft. would limited social contact tons restrictions anxiety everytime someone coughing spell runs fever. use antibody testing contact tracing/infection spotting? takes least two weeks since onset infection antibodies form even well detected test infectious symptoms show. basically track people 3+ weeks since contacted see sick? make sense. really difficult concept explain... I’m honestly surprised it’s higher... 650 cases attributed religion currently 3,000,000 confirmed cases hardly seems worthy major article. brother-in-law wife youngest child (7 months) baptized inside Catholic Church town. growing hot spot churches currently outbreaks (not mention one likes wear masks) husband going due inside fact they’ve invited people Florida within last week. don’t know you’re willing risk lives others get baptism act like us wear masks stupid concerned. EUPHORIC mods eviscerated post, presumably trying separate politics spheres life related to, guessed it, politics.

Err pee derp dip derpity derp Florida man tweaked meth head would seem. Amen Little late.



And took mayor catching wake up. Imagine much money guy making right now? S

.1*n*, *n* average income Yes. looking like beach closures reaction knew little spreads. I’m sorry people subreddit use brains 1 second? hell suppose kids going 5 days week mom dad work? Schools literally *need* reopen [He : “Two weeks ago started mass testing /… / every person go test . Ann Linde says afterwards referring Stockholm, everyone test wrong - ""did German interview, Ann Linde falsely states ""everyone, every person, even slightest symptom, go test today claims meant Stockholm region - statement true - ""did appear"" TV broadcast.

The statement true re: antibody tests, anyone get one regardless symptoms. still need symptoms get PCR. Linde discussing antibody tests, according clarification. could point excess deaths happening proof, assume he'll say deaths caused lockdown/hysteria covid itself. Hi, Pastor please correct me, pretty sure worshipping God done remotely, right? poster 

What? antibody testing contact tracing / infection spotting 

Yes Sweden that. get antibody test symptom free 2 weeks, takes time develop antibodies. Yup, early anything minor indications! Wait, he’s serious? Well good luck, sounds like already brain problems worries. kidding me? Please take 5 minutes day research brutal disease it.

You describing severe cases. 12 million people worldwide infected. 6.5 million people recovered. many 6.5 million people need amputations, lung damage, brain damage, etc.? 

Covid-19 serious business. exaggerating effects virus creating impression recovered people brain/lung damage amputations, simply wrong unscientific. Menards town started requiring masks month six weeks state mandated. resistance whiners first quickly became popular non-stupid people. Good question. wish knew. Viruses stick together.  antivaxxer refuses virus, vaccine rational people. Help see downside. look tracking chart coronavirus.1point3.com, deaths go week pattern appears lower rate decline low count days high count days starting increase. bad feeling hit low inflection point. absolutely would. 

They learn shit last four months, showing signs depression anxiety social interaction. know long term affects lockdown been, short term, know chances adversely affected greater chances adversely affected continuing social isolation missing instruction. Super eager pay taxes income    Looks like That's happening. Test-trace works small amount cases.

South Korea massive tracing program place, easily ans legally track citizens, acted early.

They still struggle. took week get one break control Seol literally 1 guy went nightclubs.


The idea US test-trace beyond fantasy; pure delusion.


The horse barn.


Herd immunity going happen. ALWAYS going happen. telling Sub since late March accepted reality yet. Eager open take money. Pimpin holy hoes easy Shocked yellow pokemon visage. lol, E X C L like that. stepping foot church vaccine developed.

USA!! USA!! U (cough cough) SA!! Wow country added 9 today :( 

And health ministers meeting soon small area put lock  people know fuckin reusable masks? cost $10 amazon pack like 3 wash clean them. Reduce, reuse, recycle. towns board going full steam ahead reopening. ""Just wait two weeks!!""

But seriously. hysterical people love sort bad news it, minds, validates hysterical reaction. kind sad pathetic. Imagine fearing virus lethality ca. 0,01% people 50 years. LMAO much pay guy stand idly say ""We probably something"" every day. sh\*t Sherlock... take infectious disease degree see numbers spiking. Dude passive Doe. One thing's sure.

You can't get virus area present - course worked - Imagine many would died lockdown.

I'm Maryland security local Wal-mart said ""Not enforcing picking fight people this!"" way know deadly virus data. know IFR probably 0.5-1.3%, significantly lower 40s significantly higher 60s.￼

I’m also sure mean “you people”. Assuming mean anti-mask “reopen now” “muh freedoms” people, assure group. 

I pro-mask, pro-containment, pro-lockdown (when necessary), also aware facts situation. Insinuating otherwise ridiculous. Probably sooner together sharing good time, hearing stories music. Maybe fickle shit need break one thing brain process wish Florida one big ass boat one defending interview, clearly talking ongoing infection testing antibody testing.

 going withdraw statement ""good news"" antibody tests promised available maybe going available fall? 

when cannot back moving goal posts? Churches disease lose job. others lose jobs.  also non-GMO gluten free must good you! I'm nervous child schooling fall. kids' school offering choice purely online schooling (more structured thrown-together-at-the-last-second thing happened months ago) let kids go back in-person. wife talked, we'll take former unless somehow convince us safety latter. idea common thing going US not.

God church. lost souls bargaining redemption Devil. Georgia handled pandemic well states far worse interesting keep track activities r/coronavirus seems really worked comparably risky activities never get mentioned.  Sorry no, clear talking antibody tests. really think 5600+ hospitals FL? Corporations beg government. They've got close relationship gets whatever want other.

If businesses begging, PR bullshit. actually wanted it, they'd simply tell government ""Order masks we're closing every one stores. stores means sales us taxes you."" This. Exactly this. I'm worried dying either, many unknowns suggested long-term effects heard permanent loss smell, diminished lung capacity, etc. shift blaming BLM. shocking thing article 44% Europeans said around turn millennium. wish every American safe passage crisis. world wishes well.

I’m Asia single digit cases daily god speed contact tracing infected sources claim. This. See ya'll Disney World weekend! Jersey Shore local, strong dislike cast New Yorkers come trash beach every summer. cousin editor show job Hollywood least launching point career. He’s even episode “pizza delivery man” reality walked boardwalk, ordered pizza walked back set acted like called ordered pizza lol. It’s hilarious thinking fake show is. way friend mine could get tested tried. literally impossible Trump win 25% vote. Stop spreading defeatist nonsense. Yes, actually no. Parents needed ensure survival kids. Even grandmas play statistically relevant role kids survival (according study read years ago). soon kids old enough take care themselves, relevance parents starts shrink. wouldnt allowed go anywhere spare time anyway.

The point bubble isolate. Guy photo, thanks trying, nose out. Middle pandemic?

You get fist Mom SICU visitors. couldn’t died. Non covid, still died alone could visit. National Guard escort white children school mentioned symptoms know talking PCR tests. antibody ones need way symptoms make sure antibodies developed. complicated, relies finding clusters work there. Italian poster thorough knowledge Italian proceedure explained it. Seemd make sense, bookmark it. 

PCR testing straightforward, yes. Yeah way going summer over, bet could survive even longer cold conditions study similar modern hvac systems... heating, ventilation air conditioning systems every indoor structure North America. positive seems stabilized 14-16% range, good, although stabilizing 10k cases day good.

Question: bottleneck testing processing tests, administering tests,.... limit testing results WITHOUT driving positive rate? mix people would taking them, number reported tests would limited. positivity rate coming back pretty high states definitely strong indicator we're missing people though. I’ve given hope completely. destroy us. I’m ready, ever die. can’t take world right now. That's exactly states it. give shit. Let people police themselves. one funniest comments I've ever read Reddit!! Coronavirus: *Omae wa mou shindeiru*

USA: *Nani?!* 650 cases linked....what bullshit article. 650 cases nationwide linked churches rolling 60k infections PER DAY. simply bigoted article trying smear churches. Typical NYTimes. don’t, money thing overlords really care Yes. right. sad state affairs. magic could save people. weighing responsibility faith leader, Mr. Satterwhite said, returned beliefs. “My personal belief is, faith God,” said. “If God wants get Covid, I’ll get Covid. God doesn’t want get Covid, won’t.”

What asshole. 

I'd challenge stupid fuck jump Empire State Building. god want die, maybe land truck full pillows. Manitoba, would decline offer.

No point potentially exposing population covid19 hockey. really bad, remember brain damage? think it´s great care homes investigated. decline care homes going long time even though sad people died it, long run likely improve quality lives alot people care homes. That’s great news, Good safety economy. That's sick man clicked link tweet took website. looked ""new deaths"" column California said 3. clicked source said 116 Tuesday. rough website mobile? Wearing mask baby I'll said would isolate got it, matter he's terrified like life NEVER understand places open . opening DEAD last. definition non essential. Fucking pray house care much. need inside packed building pray. Holy shit . gonna bad multiple cities begging supplies nurses meanwhile, Florida mandate masks contain coronavirus day that? college education every American. free...

Just thinking national defense implications gave chills. Holy hell... Fire Nation? that's proof wrong making false statements . know ""cruises"" are? People go party, get drunk buy cheap beer. get carried together trucks busses. luxury cruise, party boat using transport. Party cruises stopped regardless pandemic incredibly dirty environment. Oh yeah get cabin four people 40 Euro. American propaganda. There's logic involved. They're wearing clothes masks construction mining field. American media included seems. yea bumble actually increased usage this, literally single match lol. meh maybe someday ill meet someone, thanks pep talk haha. someone close situation here, tell even chaotic happened March. Regeneron already making mass quantities risk knowing results trial. Praying meditation linked healthy brain empty mind. keep hating intoxicate Depression come!!

Trump another lockdown election (remember 30 stay home bef0re immediately calling church open Easter?)
Lockdown come Governors. someone who's learning trying sift research, elaborate? think Birx Fauci choice let President muddy messaging. Trump hire fire placed Birx/Fauci impossible situation given ignorance temper. 

Birx Fauci tried damnedest get much education possible leadership -- White House -- owns mess messaging communication. Families also option online learning full time don’t feel safe returning schools person.

This option honestly really important. know lot parents unsure anxious sending kids back. 

Also parents shitty immune systems susceptible COVIDs nastier symptoms, option really awesome. virus waiting UK come superduper app. fact apps issued far get tweaked go. 

There simply seems lack deliver one Britain. surprise anyone UK adapts HSE app. won’t many long figure especially first days we’ll positive take helpful stance towards customers. studies like case studies meant propose presence symptom. explicitly make attempt use unbiased sample, statistics derived study meant meaningful. Sure, says ""in Sweden"". Västra Götaland Sweden, therefore included. I'd throwing rocks Covid sidelines. good summary situation looks like Sweden Nordic neighbor. wish saw points covered Swedish media bit shocked actually seems lack public critical discussion this. mean, neighbors see obvious reasons opening borders Sweden somewhat alarming get it. misspelled ""best"". best Monty Python movie me, find hockey riveting watch nascar 🥱 trump steps like lets send ragtag group trump supporting oil drillers steve buscemi save day! ""healthcare workers wear masks day"" complete bullshit. healthcare worker wears majority entire shift. exception lunch break cause can't eat mask. made ear savers 8+ hours mask wearing hurts ears. Bad take, nothing stopping getting different job. understand cases PH spiking, government seem best.. closed media company.. passed new anti terror bill planning change name one airports..


The president still trusts head department health despite failing conduct early mass testing contact tracing. like make list involved conspiracy. one, existed, would everyone pope shah iran, US governors, government countries, business leaders entertainers around world. believe ""hospitals getting paid covid deaths"" business add every doctor, coroner, medical examiner list ShockedPikachu.church excuses poor personal choices? That's great masks hand out. work, barlely masks employees. 2 minutes apart, long really fan site sets criteria. seems penalizing states increasing testing seems counterproductive. Illinois, example, increase cases testing also increased last week positivity rate held relatively steady. Somehow ""trending poorly"".

On side, Nebraska poor testing amounts increasing positivity rate that's marked ""making progress"" cases gone down.

I think everything said spot on, however. Angelina back new content. know Italian system, clearly. 

Yeah, Nordics generally rely PCR tracing. Italian system described innovative interesting though. seeing Sweden budgeted lions' share testing budget antibody testing, one hoped maybe adopting Italian style approach guess not. Acts 20:7 showed Paul met early church first day week. 1st Corinthians 16 met first day week. church meeting first day week since within decade inception. Everyone needs see contributing Elon Musk least large scale factories thousands people work at

Both indeed complete attention whores really need trusted. media ought ignore Kanye whatever presidential bid not. treat like Vermin Supreme Yeah, congressmen reopening economy refuse travel Republican national convention Florida.  OK, also stop letting people hospital cough trouble breathing lot people saying hospitalization going ruining narrative certain cities, seems taken weird stance giving fuck maybe? Look saying stuff blow up. 99% gentle nods mask wearing go smooth. 1% headline wouldnt surprised cops decide jack thus negating enforcement piece Hell they're  next talking point I’ve seen budding “car accidents dangerous coronavirus.” Maybe “cancer dangerous coronavirus” next? It’s gatekeeping question sources analysis article. work 8 hours/day retail confront reality customers wearing face coverings social distancing. wear [reusable it’s time customers public repay favor.

^^^/s Maybe covid cyclical enough people get virus stop virus-y bet true, politicians saw recovered patients perspective No, it’s tha protests! /s Eager money lol results take 6-10 days states

A lot people overlooking timeframe now. Late March/early April 24-48 hour turnaround.  yesterday former co-worker told instructed 5-10 business days. far waiting since July 1. Yeah churches tax exempt US separate government. source cash flow gullible rubes. I’m confused seen bad thing. Don’t woke people hate churchgoers want die? article covers it’s normal seeing quote lived real life much keep hoping big green guy show up. pay millions. confirm bias state obvious. 

Penny well spent. let's give billionaires bonus checks instead. strategy? Right? I'm saying would strategic helping pandemic. would strategic help billionaires loot country. country lacks infrastructure keep everybody safe. majority people cannot afford locked down. need work. lack protective supplies. Hospitals equipped enough handle patients properly. government try best, sometimes there're things impossible. States constitutionally granted authority lock sake public health. Churches make money people go them: also make money people die.

This win/win alright, start Islam, move Judaism. 

If religion problem, problem waiting purge Christians end right? start Buddhists, Jews, Muslims. Probably didn’t help R.epublicans politicized wearing mask goddamn Pandemic Yeah, hopefully mods along shortly genuinely have. Check thread /r/politics churches opening. True. going logic there. Flawed may be. *sighs* NYT clear far-left bias. Hence take every opportunity exaggerate effects corona. got bruv There's difference environment sanitation made priority people wearing masks environment wearing masks screaming around you, tightly packed marching. 

Yeah, apparently understand. late, recreational level children 5th grade heat acclimations last 3 weeks Pennsylvania, social distancing, mask. Covid 19 deaths dropping, saying pneumonia deaths way up. Everyone working White House.  Thanks, friend!  Gotta love shit. Blame churches. tens thousands protestors. According Trump...it's embers.  Embers size Uranus! Yeah really shitty situation. I'm really sorry feel way. Covid like normal virus, normal virus. Oof man prophet really churches major source coronavirus cases? mass gatherings peaceful protesters vandalizing tearing monuments ignoring social distancing. That's Christian say. Yeah, Ohio Republicans feeling little bit heat (but little). GOP always super critical DeWine Dr. Acton, going far ""inspire"" Governor kill mandatory face mask order last March went effect many people found ""offenseive"". Requiring facemasks ""a bridge far many"", DeWne kept saying. Crybabies. 7 counties required mask mandates, state cases hospitalizations trending upward (and know percentage cases sadly lead), naturally, need start little damage control. ""Don't get tested"", sounds right. Fuck guy. live 85th (not many people do, think Urbana Bellfontaine largest towns), idiot needs voted out. literally intermittent camps WW2 200-300k Japanese Americans gets talked 1 sentence entire 15 years education far. It’s literally never talked 75 years ago. knew many Nurgle worshippers US? small town Colorado wearing masks. Granted it’s middle nowhere population maybe 1000 still. Rumor someone worked mine got covid quarantine I’m curious cases rise one idiot. Also recently lot people town softball game masks. could cause rise cases well at. “So, monotheism explains order, mystified evil. Dualism explains evil, puzzled order. one logical way solving riddle: argue single omnipotent God created entire universe – He’s evil. nobody history stomach belief.”

-Yuval Noah Harari, Sapiens: Brief History Humankind I've telling people extended family thinks I've become ""crazy lib."" Nope - reading NT. keep telling voting GOP killing ability purpose Great Commission. frustrating see history keep repeating see Christians forsake call instead live temporal nation/culture war (e.g. help Nazism Germany, Crusades, prohibition, inquisition, etc.). really want police enforcing mask rules? Wear mask yes... lets get blue gang involved. I'm *endorsing* it. what's happening. surprise. Sustained lockdowns unrealistic long term strategy. Economic damage harmful people covid ever could be. No, haven’t. It’s never late start wearing masks. many models show, things still get LOT worse cities states don’t enforce mask wearing. new meaning ""I'll bank it"".

Sadly, I'm sure he's wrong. Don’t name don’t report it, people still die economy tanks regardless. Maybe government done something controlling outbreak like australia, new zealand, taiwan, china, south korea, germany, france, netherlands, etc. etc. “anyone point gun someone kill them. simple. children time even.”


Dude, hearing yourself? sound insane.

Also, ***was*** point comment?  get it. Youareverybadass. Everyone sorry. reddit randomize little bit? People seriously need work take step back macro problems seem overwhelming. 

What saying seems lurch extreme denialists. Mankind go extinct disease 1-2% fatality rates. Mankind weathered horrors before. 

Life tough. need practice mindsets actions keep durable. importantly, clearly damaging psyche stay sub. suggest take breather go mask wearing walk trails. I’m partly glad Jewish yet, percent positive increases many record testing places too.

Sorry, read book - like people, many self-declared ""Christians"" included. hoping dynamic type scheduling actual strategy end becoming. would love simply work remotely perpetuity think many levers working that.

Market dynamics Supply Demand determine gets first way pricing. **real** issue is: supply artificially limit production maximize profits? bet antibodies! Uh yes. issue school boards don’t believe serious issue won’t spend money testing equipment.

K-12 + higher edu need testing EVERYONE. Authoritarians don’t want understand. want obey. Right comment someone saying “fuck rights.” Well maybe pray really really really hard god hear us save us........ “hello GOD tell stay home stop big groups. part.

That's recent Oxford articles recent days. works supposed to. caused anything like ADE strong antibody response. need proof efficacy they've never said earlier September best that's Phase 3 trials going for. see compare March statistics.

This appears exaggerated compare Denmark point cannot confidently claim Sweden hit earlier nordics, least degree meaningful enough explain 5-10-fold differences death tallies.

According official sources Sweden Denmark, Denmark achieved peak deaths 1st April: (scroll near bottom, 22 deaths day)

Sweden achieved peak week later, 8th April. - Additionally, Sweden's death tally day Denmark's peak 52, scales 30% deaths day adjusted population. calculation improved look weekly totals, shows similar trend first glance.

When factor spread virus absence restrictions, guidelines public awareness, Denmark Sweden appear reached level attributed ""community spread"" within space days other, either direction.

The end result two countries achieved community spread within days other, Sweden 5.5 times many deaths per capita resulting actions followed. compared second-worst hit nordic country.

Research shared Swedish media even alleges non-negligible degree spread got country Denmark: numbers quickly getting worse, last saw. 14th fastest increase among states city active cases it’s ever had. people like willingly get covid, I'll listen. Deaths trail ~3-10 weeks behind cases. Yesterday saw largest single day reported deaths month. US country world. lower death rate observed elsewhere, even among severe cases.

The US's rapidly increasing case load overwhelm soon, sure.  still small. new virus scientists still learning about, seem like everyone playing role epidemiologist — making decisions precautions going grocery store, whether take plane visit older situation given rise term “armchair epidemiologist” highlight kind second-guessing prognosticating people home, like Monday morning quarterbacks without football games — sports kind — opine on.

Show hands - policy implemented work someone science medical background simple they're ""manager"" ""director""? little silly. I'm saying people can't good ideas, seems many decisions made latest nightly news broadcast.  important everything ""look"" normal. long stock market well, say businesses schools reopened, care one bit reach 10,000 deaths day more.

That's terrifying multiple levels, none fact available evidence, thinks things look surface actually define reality. That's honestly thinks testing, cases. That's even slightly true. mom working Walmart, can’t go kid stays in, mom selling video games moving shelter! sayin.. specific poster following situation great depth. singlethink ineffective. Embrace doublethink. Thanks man great power comes great responsibility story dad 48. never got much explanation. “yeah probably cold enlarged heart.” live fear literally every day knowing could happen nowhere wouldn’t know it’s late. didn’t say it, DECLARED it. Totally different. Well outdoors wearing mask proven lower transmission rate than... know...being indoors without mask.

Strange argument used anti-lockdown protests. that's works. virus can't defy physics gravity. cough sneeze lands floor, unless someone gets way (and lands them)

Proximity virus works. Hell, right wind, outside could detrimental inside, spread cough sneeze 6 feet. black death, spanish flue high school couldn’t even afford enough jerseys. track meets we’d often share uniforms swap races. who’s paying this? Depending sort mask, well...

The idea mask limits reach cloud someone emits. traditional paper fabric mask block particles going out, likelihood them. idea *something* limit spread, never claimed surefire method. 

Same thing surgeon's masks; idea breathe *too much* mrs Jones' open chest procedure heart transplant takes place. 

A dual filter (n3) full face mask block ol' thing effectively. turn tables Remember vote. forget, bill gates going try inject poison.... /S obviously real question whether teachers/staff allowed work home requested. can't think non-essential business...

They *absolutely* negotiating power excise US international travel. Whether different question. say somebody involved sheer massive scope immigration affairs. leaks aka illegal immigration, de jure policy likely remain strict borders. 


We talking self-interest. Since economics encourage immigration, immigration continues. Right now, economics *both* EU China encourage protectionism strict borders.  , front line workers shouldering exponentially increased risk already sub standard wages.  wonder see many signs looking help. reality need pay people significantly expect endanger lives enforce public policy. Churches can’t make money open. businesses. argument also ignores potential life long injuries ailments may come this.

You test virus antibody test. trying wriggle statement Västra Götaland promised antibody tests moving goal posts. admit wrong move on. Already has, especially due lockdowns economic downturn US EU. UN reports see 125 million deaths critically impoverished areas next year due decreased funding charities support US EU. Louisville greater area pretty much boat. lot people wearing face coverings. businesses even employees interface customers wearing them. KY governor even McConnell recommending it, seems would similar situation Kansas, places whatever take seriously. levels government board going anywhere. Local pols probably care declining Cleanliness witchcraft never calm   Trusting scientific findings anecdote friend's case seems like no-brainer me. But... know, you! Yep. many high schools lead insane drop rate. Religion, original cancer. Oh pipe That's not...what Jesus taught. Yeah, he's Thanos. offering job support this? Yes scientists work Pharma. China saying since feb okay agree. You’ve eloquently expanded comment. line work remove one method we’d first offer secondary option hinder ones work. said people age group (34) going bars, parties gatherings 20+ like they’re infallible really upsetting. It’s hard go somewhere socialize there’s ongoing pandemic. That’s Mayor this, grab public’s attention serious matter. Screw app, want 50% meal! sad friends thinks persecuted this. Pay taxes mass shootings! Yeah, work cleaning schools school district &amp; plan going back “business usual” month. Even though 1000 new cases day. never understand people believe god gave us brains intelligence understand science medicine develop technology medicines keep healthy safe. Every pastor i've talked said gods gods can't change give church 10% income even family starving. fuck pope bullshit? Seemed like rant subreddit hates people think rationally don’t immediately go state panic reading article posted. really. country pay small tax distributed churches. one church directly get money people. hangup I've reading articles seem always push month would know works. Last month July would know, month June honestly thinking relation zombie movies day. think I've changed perception constitutes zombie honest. 

* brain dead: yes
* fast moving: yes
* dead rotting: Also age group tends need work eat. Couple money constant drum beat ""it'll probably OK you"" go, infection age shift downwards. view opening change weather turns cold everyone forced back together inside? Lords work. obviously wants thin population. downvoted yeah one vaccines work could seeing beginning end actual ""pandemic"" part soon think guy talking people weren’t self-righteous “I’m better you” Christians. that’s legitimate point too. immunology professor! Glad see name reddit. nothing badass u goofy fat fuck redditor. anyone point gun someone kill them. simple. children time even. missed point comment entirely though. I’d speculate disease different. mutates fast enough, weak body caught guard. get yearly may keep getting worse may better prepared. 

The hope vaccine lasts least 6 months year you’ll get yearly flu shot happen agree you, want editorialize much.

I hope paint ""best"" wall 100 times. Sorry want mom kids die pint. convinced Trump stupid enough cause US lose militarily adversaries would normally pose threat US. Get November China Russia figure out! Yes. Soldiers would counted KIA likely survive head injuries. think daily new case data speaks clearly look 7-day average, keeps climbing, slowly April, faster mid-June, takes like rocket.

Compare Germany Italy Spain, actually trends downward start lockdown.

So, no. I’m tired boss. plenty protests Cincinnati always 90-90% mask use rate. you, sir, fake news. Enjoy loser life. Holy fuck. fact government isn’t even helping folks wild. today's ammo prices not. Makes sense, warm now, past April, Trump said would magically disappear. Wait, what? would counter saying language considered primary language country much (or even statistically significant portion of) international business conducted in, nation derived benefit. Language powerful transmitter culture: think idioms translate readily one culture another, example. difference good translation poor merely literal translation given saying, document, etc., good translation accounts differential understandings words phrases within different languages. 

This means language (or language primarily use) used wisely intermediary, aspects culture widely disseminated held memory speakers, even second third language. evidence this, look German. Obviously English borrows much Germanic linguistics, modern English phrases abound conversational vernacular German today-words recent years imported adapted. That’s example cultural syncretism form soft power inasmuch promotes sort cultural hegemony/ubiquity. high school football coach used make us 2 min wall sits 45lb plate. anyone quit 2 mins again, everyone made 2 mins. like that, undisciplined people hurting us all. Well ya, everyone's eager open. want get much logistics/supply chain/transportation industry. busiest time year Q4, much like many industry. driver seems company acknowledges successes throughout working remotely pandemic, however they're concerned able keep level performance spike volumes hits. levels denialism Sweden right surrounding whole situation deeply shocking part fascinates me. seem get it, although Swedish media better late still consistently good. make Swedish msm saw, Greek msm (and Greek msm). There's *huge* general reluctance Sweden right acknowledge fault tbh downright *dangerous* neighbors. least discussion YLE, NRK, DR good yeah still pretty tepid Swedish media. Getting better (esp. points like DN's coverage problems inappropriate triage), tepid. 

Frode Forland Norway's state epidemiologist actually said: believes critical debate interviewed several Swedish media ask questions things support Sweden's strategy. feels like want support government strategy. Sweden goes whole like sees issue anything. company work sent email saying enforce mask wearing anger ~~customers~~ Karens.

FTFY. Maybe God's really lonely heaven. Still sentiment it’s going towards old normal ERs. svt one almost black humor. corona crap, corona nothing we’re back crap again, like before. else make “It’s natural law chaotic ER”? Expressen one per usual alarmist doom gloom. 
She expresses concern able separate older younger patients doesn’t time. stresses seek medical care ER unless it’s emergent. There’s nothing strained health care, herd immunity, failed testing nothing else usually point at. Yeah, cops really pretty meek lately /s It'll fine. pray virus away, like successfully prayed gay away. Maybe take look first amendment bud. r/iamverybadass need follow kind preventive measures strictly. know getting careless! Watch somebody whine that’s barely 60k we’ll blow past 65,000 today. bleeding stops eventually. protesting isn’t. Yes, yes, exactly fear amplified. Okay says like every week got enrolled Angus Reid Institute, I've surveys year now, back June ""special offer"", partnered another group study. Yeah cast like 90% New Yorkers / Long Islanders represent people call “bennies” come summer incredibly rude us locals like place. best time go beaches right Labor Day weekend stop coming down. 

It make great jokes though.  posted yesterday/this morning I’m posting like site

http://covidactnow.org/us/az Yeah, seems like better job theme parks like Universal Sea World. Something similar announced that, too. VAT slashed 20% 5% things like takeaways, making attractive proposition. NYC public schools overwhelmingly serve children poor/working class. There's really way find decent percentage families want kids home day. Even worse, ones stay home day learn absolutely nothing.

We'll see coming weeks, keeping kids home year recipe disaster. What's wrong Islam? Security another low wage worker everybody else there, wearing meaningless uniform. really no. christian country, pay small tax that's it. officially quit, pay that. Thankfully doesn’t affect US since left WHO! get curve going straight up, eventually divide zero everything crashes. actually brilliant. don’t close stores protest demand mandatory mask policies nationwide then? would hit trump right gullet.  Simple. Implement China's social credit system. find somewhere social media refuse wear masks dismiss virus entirely, get low priority, period. Tuesdays highest day, Wednesdays big well, days reduce Saturday, drop Sunday, Monday lull.

I think weekend catch done Tuesdays alone, split week. really depends whether overwhelm hospitals available resources (equipment, staff, beds, etc.). hell wrong you? trying manipulate self-defense law escalate someone asking follow costco's stated policy agreed abide condition entering premises. believe apology fuckin' second, hope costco permanently banned him. shop costco would make feel unsafe gave second chance.

Dude fuck Publix. I'm pretty sure issuing fines self-funding. appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* Mods, put FAQ? Variants question posted answered hundreds times last 2 weeks. ubiquity messages suspicious. 

""Keep hearing deaths really unexpectedly low even case number spikes can't find articles anything mentioning so, this?"" think fact botched every step way underlying issue. time virus reached states, nearly results effectively manage virus already laid front everybody ignored. Even Italy way better country.

To answer question directly: personally believe judging entity/person solely sensationalized media would unfair. think would beneficial weigh failures successes. can't pretend botch prevention spread Corona, seriously think followed guidance we'd least much better situation today. four idea. It’s concealed fact data isn’t even recorded. Rebekah Jones news article site said would start reporting it. explain excess deaths then. killing people virus isn't? death stats hoax well? We’ll revert list registered hootenannies guess. What’s happening legalized looting top 1%

Meanwhile, around 150000 died virus  consider experts science, like WHO, first factor considerations telling people virus isn’t showing evidence human-to-human transmission. experts, recognized premature statement context new virus knowing barely anything it.  That’s beside point. post cases, it’s deaths. Cases steadily going up, deaths going down. Specifically, post addresses reporting lag deaths. It’s usually matter hurt matter lack interest/waste time. think it’s similar people don’t bother looking spam emails even though sometimes valid email appear spam. Know many everyday people admire courage grateful care nurses give, especially harshest conditions. Count among everyday people. There’s ton headlines “permanent lung damage” cornavirus body, flies face everything know body works.

Ok... much really know body works? skeptical journalists good all, know good journalism whats bad, unless scientist specific field? source skepticism come from? scientists/scientific reporting, ""my gut""?

This I'm saying. Doubting scientific journalism informed position great many people doubting uninformed position, shouldn't. headlines tell wear mask, scientists say so, good enough say ""yea trust science journalism I'm going ignore that"". doubting science journalism, doubting scientists. Health insurance providers love ICU stays. They're always hundreds thousands dollars without insurance.

Bankruptcy/refinancing companies ALSO love ICU stays almost always guarantee business.

For government captured businesses private interests, profit point, healthcare profitable. Vote sheriffs protect serve. Yeah, see mean. success, meant likelihood getting final approval, even helps 5% (which, considering treatment options consist bleach ineffective drug, would huge step forward). guess im sharpest tool shed Maybe pushed importance masks since beginning pandemic. Everyone listened press conferences. Disgusting upper Michigan too. Oh corona everything open? We’ll go fix problem 

Slowly surely are. Cases increasing dropped almost nothing

There license plates 6 different states one roadside park. went outside week thought people would there. Wrong Agreed start see slow ramp week, I’d guess next week average close 800 per day, current 517 today likely highest deaths US since early mid June I'm mistaken. good Credit given credit due: admirable composure tact age internet anonymity. right mind would WANT go movies right now? Even months year comfortable one. mean serious long term consequences heart lungs

The thing bothers narrative shifted past weeks.

As death rate bottomed out, people started saying, basically, ""Yeah even dont die might screwed life"".

Meanwhile, although indications kind cases, *nothing* indicating common usual kind outcome.

We 1.3 million real-life people recovered Covid. people proposing significant number suffering major effects? they? 

Surely ""The Covid Survivor living permanent damage"" interesting story local news sites? GoFundMe pages? Things like that?

So thinking ""Even survive Covid good chance I'm screwed"" ask people now, 1.3 million, difficult find evidence of? say hospitals deceitful? Work reading comprehension. Gruesome. 

Case write up:  Action junkies? Mall ninjas? audience demographic usually likes watching fighting lot? tell me, watched commercials ages. Georgia 3K/day territory testing 13 percent positive. yeah. joining party. ""The Titanic can't sink!"" probably thinking moment.

They drank kool-aid. One things must learn workspace. argument coworkers, worst thing throw tantrum leave table. leave, rest team pour blame you. Since there, can't even defend yourself.

Once US leave, next meeting WHO, Russia China countries simply put blames US country flatten curve largest economy didn't. don’t comment admins instead?

We sub cannot anything appears homepage Yes week different weeks since holiday weekend weekend slump larger usual, causing bump also larger. really wait end week compare 7-day averages. gives us time normalize holiday weirdness, also time deaths catch cases. go caramel pudding milk tea Wednesdays LOL afford quit will, unemployment surging. Doctors nurses going go? They'll potentially die Covid health complications Covid Financial complications. black white paint. Every decision anyone makes employment field right could literally long term repercussions. way know. catch Covid job least much faster timeline know die live versus going leaving job route (which still catch virus outside work too!). province (Newfoundland Labrador) several lawsuits ppl saying travel restrictions charter rights.

Ok we’ve gotten point it’s data. it’s emotional pleas. Good know. way shes 30 BMI. underlying condition. Damn, well deaths may start trending upward all. Land free, quarantine optional people infected forcefully idiots really hate politics banned sub like get want try keep politics can't sub totally free politics we're talking global pandemic let's honest turned political 😂 probably high chance lot deferment requests though. think lot people stopped taking corona seriously saw articles saying protests cause spike all. Reading article made throw towel caring. it’s fine, everyone else suffer. Looks like floridas death rates remaining steady despite increase case.

I know deaths lag two weeks, florida dont tell truth either  course it’s Fultz What’s difference? like Americans listen anyway. Hey OP good question! hate people voting you. first accuse influenced China leverage Chinese funding. try influence using funding leverage, work withdraw formally surrendering remaining influence had. Can't make shit up. They’ve increasing Florida, Texas, Arizona almost three weeks. won’t. heard much Louisiana lately,  looks like first state 2 distinct peaks. took prilosec, long do

This problem afaict shows US. Full disclosure: although work number North-Americans, I'm American, I'm Europe, take everything say think US pinch salt. belief, seen afar, US society divided two bubbles (well, actually two, minorities) fail communicate. Hence everything claimed whoever-has-most-clout-in-my-bubble necessarily true just, everything claimed whoever-has-most-clout-in-their-bubble odious lie sheep could believe.

This like this.

Believing steel industry matters mean believe women control bodies neither things mean masks conspiracy. reason (I believe) things equated lack communication.

Fix communication chance fix symptoms democracy.

Or could wrong entirely :) big tech government would act ways earned people's trust people willing install tracking app.

NOTHING SAFE VACCINE, FUCKING IDIOT Ugandan Pigeon bank account sir, need bank account details protect monies Old buildings, cleaning supplies, taped water fountains, mask mandates students, reduced buses, rules like 'five absences year equal call CPS, even doctor's note'. would send children back, choice? like explain wrong - like i'll mention cases 90 year olds heart problems survived try make seem like virus ain't big deal that.

We still know much virus (and think anyone sane would want get ) still important get facts right base things anecdotal events. People apparently look backwards peaks see delay. like chicken little thinking sky falling every morning Real sausage fest eh? known February. place reopen weeks ago. warned Feb right reopened indoor dining again. Nobody cares. Fine me. got options. Ivanka's kids Might depend temp. people go inside AC exposed. Arizona definitely experiencing that.

Maybe 10-15%?

I honestly understand downvotes here, I'm saying using download counts measure usage great metric. Yes, public behaving badly every single state. Epidemiologists always knew 100% people would adhere rules. virus allowed escape badly behaving public. Thanks, learnt brush crap off. 17/33 years life spent areas. don’t believe giving racists satisfaction getting skin. grandma used say “God gave two ears reason, one stupidity”

On positive note, married someone rural PA, entire family loving accepting towards me. feel comfortable around family extended family, rural PA white folks racists! gems here, make point focus gems rather trashy hicks nothing better do. Lol. Umm, no. try hide stuff want end full hospitals impossible hide, given balls manipulate census numbers, excess deaths tell us many people really died this. Spoiler: number much higher reported, least 35,000 higher end May wear mask receive vaccination z-pack + hydroxychloroquine one early treatments widely used?

Yes, definitely good aspects it, completely dismiss harmful long term. also means indoor dining dangerous af? 

it known early mai indoors infection rates higher. so, sucks man :/ Hackers? 

Really? excuse? 

Well...okay then. like that, began. search field works standard hospitals murdering people across country treating patients die. [Ventilator Mortality rate There's 1 3 chance she'll die, nevermind needing lung transplant. unbelievable Americans taking seriously. u/ramuh321 

worldometers +927 90 mins go. mentioned 50 deaths Florida. That’s insignificant. Businesses can’t stay shuttered eternity. COVID BLM destruction, there’s reason there’s massive flight NYC businesses (especially neighborhood) won’t reopening. Serial Killer Cuomo didn’t intermingle virus positive patients healthy nursing homes NY wouldn’t horrible. Positive cases equate crisis. cntrl -z schooled him. 

People love pounce headlines always shy away real data. anyone asks data apparently anti-masker alt-right extremist. 

This behaviour seem go way influence national guidelines. It’s ridiculous. paid attention real data, senior care facilities could locked hard, vulnerable people could told isolate rest healthy public 40 could resume generally normal life enforcing social distancing wearing masks. would cut deaths huge way building immunity, hedge effective vaccine available anytime soon. economy would dip wouldn’t ever shut down. remember outbreaks March CDC said masks don’t protect healthy people wash hands touch faces? China’s fault?

Do remember outbreaks March said masks don’t protect healthy people? Oh, remember April said ""the wide use masks healthy people community setting supported current evidence carries uncertainties critical risks."" remember June finally changed guidance masks (but still necessarily endorse use masks)?

Oh yeah, remember waited March declare forthcoming case death data since January

Haha, know trolling. seriously gonna believe China numbers report? many people report died Tiananmen Square? many Uighurs reporting held concentration camps days? I'm sure international NGOs double checking numbers boots ground. He's fraud !!!! Teachers Large urban school districts already HIGHLY unionized fully prepared strike, make mistake. administration absolutely go FUCK 70% busy problems. cause overwhelmed; mean sitting slack capacity. person protected.

Can’t say feel bad guy fired. wouldn’t want working company. don’t understand people engaging hotheads. feel like someone going end shot. advises governments encourage general public use non-medical fabric masks. Also note surge ICU capacity theoretically mean ""a bed hallway"" type situation, ""a standard hospital bed"". Think quality care surging. Don’t confuse Trump US. rest us eyes ears, mention family members suffering. Exactly, polls statistics done correctly yield amazing data scaled much larger groups, group poll couple thousand people say represents nation, something wrong that. sad thing playbook literally sitting waiting deliver cohesive message would limit could stop spread. trump GOP decided using it. 

Washington state implement guidelines, best could given federal government’s unwillingness allow support, let alone fund, response efforts. hadn’t Seattle flu project running tests government wouldn’t allow cdc Washington couldn’t nearly bad nyc. 

The main concern playbook getting politicians page handing messaging machine scientists supporting efforts. trump merely supported mask use wearing could’ve avoided much. Refusal simple little thing caused countless deaths crumbling economy. [Why would china forced pay reparations “More people die (insert something isn’t novel virus overwhelms hospitals) every day” talks CDC info Specifically statement think I’m backpedaling on?

Because that’s case I’d like take opportunity reaffirm continued support No, since kleptocracy economy needs workers workers need daycare/school work low wages keep feeding 1%, money need. median 5 days, short two, long 24. People tested positive several months solid. really want cover every last outlier, probably need four month quarantine. That's feasible; sensible, since 14 day period covers significant majority cases. always understood compromise/best fit solution. 21 days would catch more, maybe would worth adding extra week, would subject diminishing returns. We're getting feel Italy went watching NY that, FL, AZ co previous position. there's 3rd wave, people still treating meh seen happen 3 times factors

The ""other factors"" HUGE. Canada around 300 cases/day past weeks.  Toronto one larger cities North America 100 cases/day. always outliers, pandemic politicized like US. fact, levels government, regardless party, pretty much giving message following advice medical professionals. Handled better Desantis. Despite Desantis months learn works doesn't. Despite massive equipment shortages. Despite limited testing capabilities. ""Operation Warp Speed"" name federal government program nerve bang countries using propoganda. good luck proving that. lot ppl cant even get positive test, test sucks bad.

So, numbers alone, **covid already 40 times deadly flu** Maybe getting sick right thing do? Maybe hiding thinking somehow “beat” “win” virus guaranteed losing game. point fess admit running inevitable complete infection human race impossible strategy come social species like humans? that’s happen, power always consolidate, whether Athens Delian league vs Sparta peloponnesian league, Rome Empire, China, Russia, England, USA, power always end concentrated small set regional hegemonies.

Also, school outbreak--which full capacity, happen--then school shut down. Unpredictable shut-downs much disruptive students' education planning model allows social distancing, regular sanitation, consistent use PPE. work conditions enforced essential professions like healthcare. school setting requires enormous amount resources, money, leadership--which noticed, federal state governments eager provide. obv. serious.

Honestly, really don’t get nurses can’t double shifts months.

I mean come ladies midst pandemic, it’s time bit sacrifice. Y’all work like three 12-hour shifts week, nothing add another couple shifts mix greater good.

I mean it’s either girls step make rule citizens wear masks. nurses idea bad breathe breath entirety thirty minute grocery run.

Y’all much little, every single one hours already working efficient work possibly get, truly it’s appreciated hope come physically mentally healthy.)  3 day 7 day average rise, albeit slightly. 

7 day average hasn’t rise since May, that’s noteworthy concerning. reality it’s probably opposite I'm considering throwing 3 masks, scarf, full motorcycle helmet (all once), running treadmill show done. hard part would putting helmet everything else. would easy post YouTube. 

It might wait little though :( I'm recovering pulled muscle inner chest (one intercostals), whenever aggrivate running, forces stop chest pain. So, sucks.

I could get minute two, long enough informative video. idea I'd fit helmet stuff. head pretty big already, want buy XXL helmet fun karma. I'm going try share pov:


Imagine reciprocally willing maintain relationship decided share happening around globe. another epidemic happened wherever share details. think would play US? fund completely another agency play part is, US, alert threats around world? alone would make sense sharing information?


I believe care something (well-being humans, including you, also someone never meet poorer country) disagree something, try really hard make hard, give completely go play toys corner room. that's live life. pushing agenda posted article. something happened. get posted people use agenda?

Bill Gates 5G deep state mind control, man! /s Mostly parents, grandparents, teachers. don’t see anyone brain would want dine right . reported yesterday average age positive cases dropped 15 years lately. alone huge impact mortality...

not necessarily. 

Notice median age positive cases, median age people infected virus. 

There way knowing due increased testing making tests available younger people before. 

Back March/April, one things qualified person getting test old age. Another hospitalized, would also skew towards older people. Getting elementary school strain strep you’re 30s fucking wild ride. sets chains immune system events you’ll dealing years. covid covid/flu. Death sentence. Adults able handle it. enfeebled ones. regular parents. aren’t even close running directly contributed higher death rate. Oxygen shown better treatment most.

So trying naive?

You know ventilators provide assisted breathing help supply oxygen lungs, right? really curious actually even know talking about. hope leaves. worry won’t. worry tasked enforcing removal behave tasked reigning past nothing. worry tasked protecting sanctity democracy choose party people. weren’t even enough tests living people months, makes think testing dead people randomly? Hurricanes hoax! cab driver thinks gross give ride.  Yeah, let’s practice social-distancing Thanksgiving Christmas outside. goes right pockets bloated admin executive staff. money helping American students way. anything taking spots American students driving tuition rates. universities year-over-year increase foreign students accepted roughly equal decrease in-state students accepted.

And first thing university executives care losing cash cow. None said thing concern foreign students already enrolled. never offering opportunities cultures making campus diverse. 

It would one thing private schools, state schools worst offenders. State schools subsidized state taxpayers exist serve needs state, place wealthy foreign kids party four years go back home. I'm talking beaches.

EDIT- also parents get treatment 6 days started experiencing symptoms. Fuck people. don’t problem saying smoking usually bad. even study faulty/not something reference. 

I issue saying it’s possible smoking associated better COVID-19 outcomes. dismissing things hand doesn’t make sense bad idea. repeat three words everyday... “What today?” blocked them. absolutely surprise, enjoying FB years.

Undercounted deaths would happen home falsely attributed causes due lack available tests early on. Overcounted deaths include COVID factor persons cause death necessarily cause suspected proven cases. read [CDC's reporting guidelines see doctors permitted list COVID ""presumed"" ""probable"" cause gets counted toward statistics states (see NY). Also, hospitals [are paid per patient cases COVID-19 either confirmed Whether see incentive commensurate support you. 

There's high degree subjectivity cause death reporting [WHO issued hard say certainty whether over-reported not. clear vast majority people dying lot common vulnerable illnesses well. Hi there, already posted Native Americans treated way. Trail Tears ring bells? would optimistic herd immunity. 70% works diseases aren’t highly infectious. Coronavirus definitely going require least 80%. almost 60k cases day, April hit 40k peak

In April, much testing available, entirely possible 40k confirmed cases means actual infections 60k now. probably likely thing cause additional deaths. sad thing point, happening. states fair warning months happening Northern states somehow thought immune it. makes angry. What?  White people ones discriminate.

I never said suggested thinking young people non-caucasian background discriminate.

Also never said think true.

I'm suggesting Asian people can't racist. I'm aware racist Asian people, Asians races. I'm sorry shitty experience college club. seem suggesting Asian people racist, natural them. extremely offensive. approached club sort attitude, I'm sure there's story kicked out. people sane mask/take things seriously willing confront punish make country dangerous let in, we’ll suffer. want travel (or get covid) need convert thwart deniers  But, but...

HOORAY GIFs! Really depends kind treatment need - standard hospital care, they'll probably fine. need ICU, big problem. conditions suffer from?

You would get phone call. tracer would tell you’ve exposed ask symptoms, needs, etc. provided resources meet needs info testing. ask self isolate x number days that. one notified. one checking you.

If end testing positive find you’ve exposed contact start process again. never tell anyone exposed them, even spouse. Nah..Coronavirus says ""Go bar get beer. Linger awhile. mask required..."" necessarily big threats. time become big threats left unchecked. must understand corporation gets big enough, longer making money, maintaining control market. Fast growing market disruption companies pose threat can't either bought out, eliminated. 

The applies rich people general. reach certain threshold wealth, longer care making money, work towards ensuring wealth threatened. becomes control money. 

Corporations general necessarily reporting covid cases, correct. entire media system owned 6 companies. 6 companies turn owned massive holding companies, hedge funds, incredibly wealthy families also large corporations portfolio. corporations massive conflict interest mutual ownership. words, many shareholders people. means good one company good others. time wealth grows increasingly consolidated towards top like pyramid structure. today, billionaires exist, would take normal person making $50,000/year, 20,000 years become billionaire.

I learned acknowledging community's treatment mean victim. lot Non-Black Americans, even Black immigrants, assume Black Americans admitting victimhood stating realities people history true. acknowledge something, share it, work dismantle it.

Also, lot immigrants believe idea ""pulling boothstraps. one that's ultimately control future."", mindset completely ignores much environment shapes opportunities outcomes. 

There play people succeed succeed beyond abilities. course, hard work determination make likely successful; but, two things alone make successful lot hard-working determined people still living poverty. maybe. still big problems coronavirus, lot things since started ALSO help lower infection rate flu (washing hands, social distancing, working home, masks, etc).

Deaths time low!!

(Am right?) Race pretty well documented tool invented richer classes divide oppress lower classes prevent class revolution. Unfortunately centuries drinking kool-aid become thing addressed separately, also right, race issues obscure class issues entirely now. opening vaccine available. get economy stupid, still believe lives important thing.

This virus incredibly contagious contact tracing impossible really gets going. really freaking nightmare contain virus.  

School, especially elementary school completely table. going happen state pushes reopen run absolute villens. 

!!!DO SEND CHILDREN SCHOOL FALL!!! Agreed. set expectations need keep mind success rate clinical trials low cumulative probability pass rate require large number trials/attempts. 4 Phase III trials ensure 50% chance finding one works. roughly point we're edu¢ation Shouldn’t become parents then.

Pretty much guaranteed orange nut calls Kung Fu Flu. reopen means face face reopen online course count well? Wasn’t lag 2-3 weeks deaths, it’s 4-5?? guess keep moving goalposts you’ll eventually right loll Dumb question erecting outdoor hospitals florida like states? phone use poop issue lead time bias, since testing ramped country able 50k tests per day 500k, able catch cases infancy opposed march people getting tested ER What??? Weird... Starting seem like america going quarantined get pandemic control take step back , think leaving world health organization pandemic!! you’re saying Doomsday news stories climate Change making weather worse lies?

Looks like someone wasn’t paying attention didn’t notice one agenda cancelling another agenda  best Kentucky anyways.

which less real Ohio, course. it’s report deaths, told them, said, don’t stop reporting deaths? makes us look bad 
/s cast ballot dead people. first time happened. God that's awful. I'm sorry. Definitely Brazil, South Africa 30k patient USA study start next month. 80% based hunch? down

Nationally. regional level areas spiking cases, deaths up. take 7-day rolling average new cases, look 7-day rolling average deaths occurring week get pretty good extrapolation many people end dying based new case volume.

You can't really though, things disconnected long time now. Let's look numbers:

Deaths 7/7: 556   Cases 30/6: 43 002

Deaths 30/6: 575  Cases 23/6: 30 703

Deaths 23/6: 628  Cases 16/6: 23 443

Deaths 16/6: 723  Cases 9/6: 21 287

Deaths 9/6: 850   Cases 2/6: 22 671

Deaths 2/6: 1080   Cases 26/5: 22 472

And on. Deaths dropping way faster cases months, even cases started go back again. Case data US weird overall since used missing many cases beginning missing less now. way better look hospitalizations positivity rate. celestial body Taiwan? percent surgeries require general end ICU? reoccurring ChaChing! know, it’s still dangerous people it’s nearly clear cut make sound “no damage done”. don’t know long term effects risk getting sick killing neighbors? Cavity Creeps: makes holes in... LUNGS! mayor Las Vegas also charge Florida School Board? sub negative. Y’all trying make Trump look bad. Can’t y’all focus positive!

/s Yep. I’m lot less worried direct death death million cuts line. I’ve seen estimates ranging 10-15 times infected currently show. antibody testing sure reliable is. want get good idea stats tge 2 countries positions are, look 'active cases.' 1.6 milion States, 27,000 Canada.

That going problem. I’m Florida would find way move putting kids life family’s lives risk politicians trying force normalcy unnormal times. sad reality though many can’t move. forced risk lives politicians nonsense. ... well stated indeed! Nobody could seen happening second time going use inhaled corticosteroids bronchodilators COVID ton options. newly diagnosed asthma patient ton options well. asking people well controlled asthma switch recipe disaster. case Symbicort, preventer 1. Works 2. afford. reason afford go Mexico spend $25 instead $350. literally alternative me. goes away basically switch entire strategy.

But anyone starting steroids, crapshoot. ton options. I’m shocked. Shocked tell US undercounting 37% lot racism like happens, although it’s never malicious intent, sting time. Also it’s American problem since America diverse.  Yesterday Trump posted Facebook school open Biden trying delay opening political reasons. way beyond anything making sense. saw news conference know talking forcing schools open. feel like f-ed. could move think would breathing condition requires humidity year round. Watching news depressing. Well, best call say goodbyes grandma suppose. hate state sometimes 😔 official plan? secret plan told conservatives? Remember r/coronavirus information could use keep safe it’s surveys Canadian people? bet DeSantis feels real smart letting Trump send unneeded ventilators comrade Putin. Jeaaaasus, read eloquently put explanation above? crystal clear. 

Aside this, I'd like point virus could mutate again. already mutated become even infectious. read bulletin, become even better infecting us. bad before, gotten *badder*! ( Feh, I'm copying colloquial grammar.) 

So, could get worse, like....it kills faster. 
Or, could get milder, like ordinary flu. every person infects, opportunity mutate. Many countries seem done fine per capita basis. aunt heart issue ER several times past months, uncle Parkinson's, cousin daughter weak lungs daughter allergic everything also routinely ends hospital.

It's great. teachers union, though? Strike. able get people fill positions. one wants Florida school. “ruin” haha talked PCP today couldn’t even get tested there. couldn’t believe it! Nicely put Spain found covid water samples March 2019. covid already December 2019. China lock far faster US done contain virus. death toll China accurate like US. 

So Trump blaming China for? acted worse turn show good example. I'm sure still early tell given amount hospitalizations need ICU beds seem like would lower rate death. mild case COVID also includes symptoms like pneumonia causes long term lung scarring. dad nearly died pneumonia earlier lives us still lung issues. course cases pneumonia terrible either.

Even though soon really know, article others like it, try break consequences disease based studies past SARS outbreaks:  Cats might Rona would throw parties get infected could stay Ritz HIV treatments address deadliness. meese(mooses?) citizenship Canada need close back add narcolepsy highly associated H1N1 noted adverse effect H1N1 Pandemrix vaccine Europe. I'm anti-vax courts paid millions people developed vaccine fast-tracked. think really dumb put hopes vaccine huge safety concerns ""light speed"" vaccines might safety shortcuts really feel like emphasized containment disease instead rampant spread. Testing positive virus one requirement counted ""case"". test positive symptoms counted case. actually infected virus, get sick, need hospitalized, test negative counted case (although rare, people category often tested test positive second time). Call dad tell him. Fauci initially saying masks necessary early March saying one biggest arguments ""liberal media"", calls it, attempt something can't put finger on. bad, says. wearing mask generally, know anyone personally become ill, he's kinda buying it. Alternate title: 19% Canadians need reality check, relatives US. good job. bunch astroturfed protests intimidated Dr. Amy Acton quitting DeWine's backbone MIA since. love joke. Actually Trump pay since idiot refused deal COVID 19 mess.

As American fully support Canada EU/UK shutting borders US citizens. 

Those countries would idiot office aka Trump taken seriously sooner. American here. honestly understand wearing mask = losing freedom. global pandemic, every country type response virus. 

But no, deep state starting masks busting chains suppose.

I lost much respect people Slight correction. 50k Zoom classes Harvard. two extra words worth 50k many people. autoimmune disease frequently spike fever infection. always worry sort system would look like someone situation?   Plot twist: Biden working undercover Trump decades Lmao r/coronavirus absolutely hates good news covid... especially regards US Florida given up. Seriously, that's happening here. Damn consequences, we're opening everything. 

Disneyworld opens July 11. house probably fall learn stand imho spreading us. Europe main source people use public transportation. group gets herd immunity proactive response, spread system nearly stops. largest method people interacting. 

The us private transportation. entirely different virus distribution method. know why. strange talk Trumper says 'China's lying"" ""Taiwan lying numbers"" yet crap. line greatest crock bullshit ever heard entire life. ""it's cold gives virus. get heats up."" 

""ok heat that's causing it"" mother fucking idiots.

No people fucking congregating bars, restaurants, beaches etc. one fucking contagious viruses we'll ever see. Grew south Florida went til mid end June went back mid August. Nah weeks. goalposts 1.5 months. Pretty much everything ""inconceivable"" glorified Jeff Dunham-puppet Trump's fist ass. New York state close 1000 daily deaths peak. Ok. Child Protective Services. check investigation dropped. overworked understaffed.  called ago gave different phone number. person gave another phone number. person gave phone number one answered. going get worse. blue shirt mask photo story? ""Feels good"", lot people saying it! left first wave yet.

Yes, weakest die first wave, death rates second wave likely lower. apparently best strategy come with, admitting we're fucked saying ""next time bad"". Dont forget Alabama.... Yes don’t think meant respond me? Americans always make everything themselves? Even leftists supposedly opposed mindset self-obsessed. vaccine developed UK fuck Trump. 

Yes get Trump bad, bleach, UV rays, test less, USA! USA!, orange man bad etc. know, shut fuck up. sound brain dead point. Churches now, colleges later. Nah, married several years 3-4 kids part down.

Just pointing statements like saying red trucks fire trucks. Nah stop wearing masks open bars. Abandon don’t let Fauci talk press. testing means false positives never test anything ever concept empirical evidence means feelings wrong /s understand. work hotel state never closed. Every day watch guests walk around without masks. Every day look parking lot see license plates NY, CA, Ohio (lot Ohio reason?), Texas... pretty much every state union except Alaska Hawaii. nerve wracking. Virus apparently thrive places people abandon critical thinking. Bar, sports event, karaoke, church, etc... believe said Covid-19 took mask away Interview... Easy-bake oven adults. true asshole. Also, face shields exist! difficulties breathing, face sheild allows airflow protection. O2 excuse; really wanted protect people, would. True, kids want nice sunny, mentioning stuck indoors want play outdoors could hard enough nice may september stuck indoors, can't imagine middle august.

I grew NYC went public schools. miracle anyone learns anything best circumstances (not knocking teachers - 90% parents' fault). kids capable learning can't surrounded kids toxic backgrounds. constantly see reminder (I agree it), see shit protestors?  deaths really high compared case load lately. Even excluding large dump week ago. sure why. exciting write article ""NC's 7 day rolling average deaths date reported lowest since mid-April"".

or

""NC's ICU numbers stable, NC's deaths date death continue decrease since mid-May peak"" 1/100 overall state going depend greatly location. many hotspots. 

If avoid indoor spaces crowds probably okay. certainly nice areas drive around. hate see people situation. I'm sorry.

The Home Depot following rules. Worst place I've seen since started.

Definitely going Lowes on. Yall got hella trees though compared OK require church. know 😬 granted I'm taking advice anyone's crack pipes cant say i'm surprised guess, that's nuts. guess ingrained me. need stop thinking like ... schools go 1st week September early August? regional thing? wonder many church-goers went protests well? lot confirmed cases kids, enough know far lower death rate. chance would ever fly US. People screaming tyranny asked put mask greater good. Imagine telling can’t leave state 3 months. going -50, patients made antimatter Sarcasm pretty unhelpful unfunny days. http://imgur.com/gallery/BZq4Pyd

Maybe you’re thinking Trump anti-maskers, like ones showed Michigan assault riffles open state late March? long people taking vitamin D?

If trolling, try harder. not, try harder. Oh boy think ""recovered"" individuals refusing wear masks.....that something else Yes take people working industries long time recover. large travel corporations absolutely fine.

The big question is...will happen everywhere US we're seeing opened early? open recklessly whereas states opened slower might able miss hit. Wow, sounds like news Wuhan back February... shocked realise many Americans die every single day anyway... *yawn* Okay, interesting. remember couple hospital executives interviewed past weeks, saying ICUs typically 85% filled anyway. wonder saying keep people calm?

This fits experience US talking Danish colleagues every day week throughout shutdown.

Mask usage also way higher US even early compared western countries despite talking hear it.

Testing takes though. results took three days get back. long take?Although Denmark didn’t start testing lot early though can’t explain early success much.

People stop panicking, spikes deaths happen often, check [7day moving dropping. see graph high death spikes occurred many times important thing moving average lowering testing increasing. Four months. Florida, Texas, Arizona absolutely need lockdowns. can’t mitigate numbers social distancing, hand washing, mask wearing.

(And areas aren’t locked get flooded out-of-State people trying avoid *their* lockdown, areas probably level lockdown instituted well.)

Good enough me! Yes, implication opening schools risky kids entirely accurate. directly risky, kids die directly it, would think see losing parent risk. family go bankrupt medical bills risk.

How overwhelming hospitals? That's risk. big one, since impacts people conditions well. get car accident, heart attack.

It's risky thing get kids together indoor setting. Even okay, rest us be. imagine trauma kid suffer brought home virus killed hospitalized parent? biblical churches complying individual state's laws regarding religious activities. go local authorities go Jesus's teachings. Oh bad, commented wrong post. US superchurch money theft/laundering post, hence previous comment Like three year old declaring cover eyes, can't seen would describe tactic. Well suppose either last two options would still better 'We learn live like this' scenario going south border Nah, let's real USA bottom 3 India Brazil gonna duke top spot.

....which awful considering much better developed supposed amount resources have.

Like based resources available, definitely worse, I'll agree much. They’re everywhere Chapel Hill Durham, now. one holding gun parents' head. choose go there. 

If wanted go church wear masks, could. I'm getting optimistic death rates yet.

We know early spring deaths lag several weeks. we're testing people far earlier, leading lead time bias. seem suggest think highly *any* christian denomination.

I say evangelicals, though: built globe scanning kiddy-diddling cult way Catholics have. point coronavirus threat? thing is, total deaths close, total numbers small, people area going regard unimportant. think made political purpose attack dems widen gap otherwise agree. Boobs uplifting. 90% general public's cases missed, hard time believing meat packing plant cases also missed. keep mind lot states reporting recoveries accurately Extended lockdowns happen completely fuck initial lockdown cannot get virus control testing contact tracing. 

The countries likely need extended lockdowns ones botched initial lockdown. US, Brazil, Russia, Serbia, India, etc. see happening medicine well. Better walk carried out. Welcome exponential spread. So, enough tomorrow. Gonna suck get sick Friday. stopped going church moving America seeing hypocrisy churches lot people go church. Opened eyes real quick. 9989 cases? great... terrible. simultaneously keeping people things seem much less conducive spreading virus, church.

this dispute indoor/outdoor, mask/no-mask debate, hell even comparing impact single cup communion versus passing water bottles would difficult sort out.

that said, government set rules, church meet parking lot sing songs, hear sermon call protest? could protest chant things, march call service? take vitamins. Several them. multivitamins, though.

Are brands reliable?

It's weird industry tightly regulated. store quietly approach someone isn’t wearing mask doesn’t seem confrontational. 

At store allowed say anything someone wearing mask -- I'm state required masks 2 months now. yet, supermarket employees busting asses far less entire time. NEA AFT already fought state plenty places (even striking theoretically illegal.) Teachers unions one unions US real power.

Teachers want teach, they're going put non-evidence based unsafe bullshit, president/governor wants to.

In places, best going students sit class, basically learning, supervised non-union admin. take vacation time stay home? Smart, temporary. Dude i'm scared you! Google Covid database break region. approximately 25 US states lower caseloads per capita higher testing per capita provinces Ontario, Quebec Alberta. N word Sturgis make look safe sane state mandatory REAL ID year bound passport confirmation. Yep. I’m retail worker. best end day kids want won’t kick out. It’s frustrating. understand coworkers given up. doesn’t feel worth it. lot articles points r/CoronavirusTX totally get that. grew Domino's Pizza still ordered every that.

I'm positive recipes whole wheat pizza dough. end going rabbit hole though. Sometimes start dough dough days ahead plan making pizza, plus ended buying one Ooni gas pizza ovens recently. worth opinion (and family's based like pizza we're making), become bit obsession. Shit like longer want RN. knew 100% certainly could get job Europe Canada graduation would worth it. want take care Americans. putting health risk bunch arrogant, ignorant people refuse wear masks. Maybe need learn make point, what? goal discredit Fauci, feel free share specific statements he's made contradict published peer-reviewed studies virus. Yea I’d assume wouldn’t much capitalist. Took lot effort get comment 🤣 sure ain’t mad probably lot people also would proactive seeking medical attention want go hospital afraid contracting virus know imminent danger. Honestly we’ve “beating” Florida, Texas California whole time. way people us way testing. [Then sit floor yell, ""I'm American, churches anymore size rock concert, way I'm going back church long time. they're bunch pot hating, abortion hating, trans hating, homophobic bitches take 2000 year old book literally. Separation church state country joke especially South ""What, like teaching could hard anything."" -- DJT goes mass hiring spree $10/hr ""teachers"" among ranks unemployed 2 months. enough staff work hospital? like temporary tent hospital? I'd surprised hear regular hospital shut down. tenth percent isn’t deal personally. won’t change perceive risk. YMMV

All numbers look big deal country size. 3 million people die every year country. sounds like apocalyptic number.

Doubling already super low chance dying isn’t doubling much. Doubling would make big difference 25 percent chance dying year, double small number still small number. Vaccines really small step. real deal compressive public health policy level administration.

In country two months total lock (10% GDP 25k dead 47M population thanks ask), we're implementing contac-tracking day passing dealing local outbreaks pop out. Literally first one one related covid-19 bumblefuck. notice either fine and/or jail time. fucking singapore, west.

But three...well, notice tested positive broke quarantine. exactly I've saying throughout entire thread.

You dumb cruel. Fuck we're even argument? COVID-battered city world... far... Meanwhile USA... get straight, arguing happens outside classroom makes teachers job dangerous right grocery store clerk?

Or think made comment whether teachers job difficult responding that.

Since didn’t make comments difficulty, must first, correct? sound like country fault. Sounds like employer. can't run nearly fast least Thanks, that's useful perspective - ever thought poor hand hygiene. :)  think shared bathrooms could still big problem though. schools putting serious air purifiers bathrooms. Drove one near last weekend merchandise inside gone. kind spooky see empty wooden tables glass facade. Hold up, wait minute. mean tell us bunch people gathered closely indoors extended period time, singing, talking loudly etc., big risk spreading highly contagious respiratory virus? Get out.

/s *Russia, USA Brazil:* ""Hold vodka"" Tough shit Trump. send kids die! started first place? Intentionally breaking quarantine crime. 

Full stop. would take youtube videos go viral people arrested grocery stores people start falling line. people causing scenes stores tough yelling minimum wage workers, cower quickly might get arrested. Korea has. Kids split 5 groups, one day week person classes. Desks plexiglass shields them, masks required, social distancing + talking strictly enforced lunch since masks cannot worn. shitty troll. Also, world past peak? needs done front store huge security guard. bankruptcy. mean, that's philosophically cancel culture is. sad life must lead. . . 

""media controlling narrative""

Pathetic. think??? every death caught. employer needs cover ass &amp; guy obviously liability waiting happen. I'm sure find job background checks prospective employees possibly considered great waste water arid regions? rate someone carry water clay jugs nearest stream lake long distance back homes many cases. sorry hear that. hope orange nightmare soon. 

here europe people successfully start sueing officials slow failed covid response. thought american thing. 

the anti mask talk also starts swap over. social media fault. 
im fighting since months people. 
seriously whole world cant wait get orange monkey office. objectivly seen hes none actions stupid talk caused lot unneccesary deaths. Whoever downvoted rewatch series - flawed was. series exaggerated events (nuclear power plant can't nuclear bomb, second explosion even able reach second reactor even worst case scenario, whole Europe never risk divers survived) blatantly lied others - example one died bridge, safe - shown internal politics pretty well.  Shut give already...  Phase 4 lol! 

Paraphrasing Jim mora:

Phase 4?!?!"" Mora screeched shock, raising eyebrow scrunching face. ""Don't talk phase 4! kiddin' me? Phase 4? hope win game!"" would good time open schools right ? old hospital special surgery. Sounds like already know marriage isn’t going work out, staying together kids. It’s obvious zero respect you, children, others blatant disregard anything that’s happening world. I’m sorry man. ""Do forget Philippines!"" - *Jo Koy* Smashing goals need lease office space, pay utilities, etc. make sense management financial standpoint? Devos pushing charter schools knowing church schools literally aids bored helicopter moms 'teach', USA going get much worse. Uneducated, unethical, fake bible thumpers. hope stay safe friend!

Keep good fight. know overwhelming make difference. Yup Slavic alphabet Oh yeah, love Canada Prob went hospital way became bad.... New Testament got rid that.

The elders complained Jesus disciples ritual cleaning meals, like John Baptists did. Jesus ""lol chill dudes."" Yup, agree more. hard, folks see ""gatekeepers"" refuse make changes status quo would endanger power. collaborate strike teachers parents. solid plan masks optional cleaning. scriptures already says need parade worship, private. Ie need attend church connect God.

Great time practice pandemic. 

But hypocrisy deep. 🤦🏻‍♀️ never sat next air conditioner, catch terrible cold way. really bars, idiotic companies oblige workers could fully remote go back work pack public transport ""your contract says must desk every day"". boss extremely aggressive every time anyone mentions working remotely, found via internal chats new coronavirus cases main office company totally silent it. even organized shitty afterwork drinks snacks (which refused attend).
Cramming people whole day every day open space public transport causing second wave, bars. point hope get reconfined catch it. someone asks put mask, respond like this, deserve lose job. dude seems unstable shit  Fauci talks truth whenever let televised appearance. Birx tries cover Trump. complicit whole mess. hell believes “He’s attentive scientific literature details data,” Birx said. “I think ability analyze integrate data comes long history business really real benefit discussions medical issues.” must praying hard enough praying wrong God. No, wait, third possibility. god. much would cost world around US*  Went church day. least 100 people, family ones wearing masks. joke. theaters set open August? Tenet? Ventilators really issue corona. Staff beds important. moving away ventilators much possible need overstated start enough available. No.....it's slap face..... terrible idea honestly. read pre-print articles make public health expert. sure they're saying supported sufficient weight evidence. review 500-1000 papers every single day conduct systematic reviews every week. contribution been? easy cast stones nobody cares say. Bad news Yeah it’s worrisome sure, it’s looking like going going cases awhile. Porn sickness prevalent days. want people die. said that, though, hope get slap reality...  Separate apps, independent other. No, lockdown killing 20x people COVID. fact, would 3 million US far, crazy person.

Most developed world agreed disease exceptionally dangerous--much temporary economic disruptions. think special perspective affords clarity hardly anyone else has?

Sometimes whole world looks dirty, actually windows due cleaning. would probably good millions die aswell Supposed make one way traffic aisles (a bit moot nobody else aisle, granted), somewhat distance moving row... they're like pediatricians am, focus entirely direct risk children - consideration happens child infects family members. IMHO orphaned child unhappy child. Yep maine despite fact masks supposedly required many businesses refuse enforce higher ups demanding employees don't. first started also told employees wear masks scare customers. Thank you. count number times left home since end February fingers. 6 ft continue. virus definitely made-in-China. infects people cherish democracy, value freedom, believe God love lawsuit. virus can't spread dictatorship, tyranny strict locking down. called CCP virus. prove Chinese community hardest hit district Spain zero infection. people since stopped engaging me. Dumb question - vaccine good 15 years, would factor study? L.O.L.

On pace quarter-million deaths USA alone. we're lucky. 

Me. ""We save lives punish people expose others deadly disease.""

You. ""You're Dictator!!!!""

Do even understand despicable human are? utterly reprehensible. Still technically America, North America least! We’ve got Central America South America too. Argentines called saying American Unitedstatesean whole milk,

That's ""Homo Milk"" Canada. BTW. Im employed lockdown orders. dont insurance, along 8.5% Americans rising. Also believe get first test free subsequent tests exposed again? greedy companies cover one? There. Solved! What? live NJ Monmouth County, area reference follow comment. Every single store go to, every person masked up. well that's good news! least people might take seriously. one takes seriously try tell put back on. going hit 100k? I'm thinking either next week two weeks now. flat percentage tax income, flat fee. heard opting somewhat like canceling comcast back sued become officially Christian. USA

If ever listen American tell greatest country earth.

I tell least 30 countries better America every way. pay crap treat same. Today sub makes 15 bucks per day mom sub 1997. Well supposed insurance get like massive protests weeks back seeing this. Something like 30,000,000 gathered en masse publicly, population many countries. Hire bouncer stand door like club bar. mask, entry.  brother teacher, guess happens open shut really fast.

Schools coming sorts contained pods systems students one gets pod isolate rest prevent spreading school.

The problem kids still congregate outside pods leave school it’s going really ineffective.

In addition, lot parents going force shut refusing send kids school. Think apple closing shop going China. lions naturals, gmo free gluten, lactose, perfectly safe. realize state experiences surge, call medical staff back, right? Well, fact is, every man subscribes science. lot bend God. Hinduism, lotta scientific practices (as advanced science could back then) passed ""religious"" stuff.

Like fact person must always take bath change different clothes entering house went funeral distant city. later practices would called superstitious archaic discarded. 

But mom follows practices day hospital always washes hands takes bath whilst clothes washed.

Coz days, people microscopes check virus bacteria killed person, prevention prevention ultimate cure. 

And way deliver message explain science attach religion practices, cannot explain everyday man, one prolly follow say god deems good something. 

Been noticing lotta stuff, lot whose values alive common people following it, logic behind lost. guess could apply modern world's new science 3000 years maybe. even survive long. actual LA County news release 7/7 said “due backlog 2,000 test results received one lab...”

My question 2k test results? 2k positive results? would big difference 2k test results. Even say 10% rate, we’re talking difference 1800 positives backed up.

I wish worded better. Well, duh, they're offering express bus ""salvation""! think *spot on* /s since psychological. That’s disgusting. speak around mask plexiglass easily. cough symptoms cough. presence COVID virus particles technically symptom itself. talking phlegm stuck throat type cough deep-down insatiable type cough? Symptoms vague feeling bit tired, yourself, slightly elevated temperature point fever.

The bottom line reputable study going able tabulate data answer question definitively good question is. I'm genuinely curious, think K-3 OK? still open, back mostly full lock down? low bar hope people complying voluntarily


Looks like one magical happy land people right thing voluntarily.


Where live there's laws, need law enforcement enforce people care.


So fine them, give ticket, arrest them, like anyone else exposing body parts putting others danger.

More people comply starts happening. could backlog due 4th July holiday. meaningful number 7 day average. Absolutely....but that's majority recoveries. Those, part, outliers, norm. refuse accept preferable potentially uninfected people sent jail prison small chance infected somebody might hurt. 

I can't believe explained. Punish knowingly ill ignoring rules; make businesses serve custom customer refuses wear mask. imprison people following blanket rule could nothing wrong. mean death row actually may mean death? Hmmm, well hell. feel entitled served. Businesses business you, limitation discrimination protected class....of non-mask wearing individuals not. Here’s opinion this: feel putting mask form suppression violates right disregard increasing infection rates deaths worldwide expect repercussions called out. Moments like associated name long long time that’s accessible future employers affects family well. I'm going read fucking paperback worth rants search point either.

Basically, people would normally comatose fully alert. scary virus does. country's government's plan actually virus kill many people possible, things might do? Disneyland reopening? cops idiot refuses comply?

Fine them. great! Really showing countries fast this! 😂😂😂

This comment I've also seen shift quoting total stats per state show inaccurate claims things getting worse hotspots. FEMA helps emergencies. COVID ain't emergency, business usual now. Let translate anyone speak 'faceless international mega responsibility shareholders, customers certainly general public. Great work. demographic data really shows impact virus. It’s merciless 65. make 11% reported cases 73% deaths.

Meanwhile 44 CFR .18% actually fairly good news considering many people undiagnosed would indicate true IFR likely .1% 44.

There needs emphasis disparity. 44 risk minimal tolerable. 45 54 starts risky (probably depends lot individual health status) 65 need protected take every precaution possible.

I think could policies protect people spend time emphasizing everyone needs limit exposure elderly. far us, questioning authority fine needed. problem people questioning wrong authority. 

I waffle blaming people leaders since years inept leadership partisanship left people unable trust government saying. 

But suppose it’s also us elect better leaders. dunno man. people run kinda lousy lol guns

Pretty sure sentiment holds true US FL. Source: born raised LA, parents small arsenal, friends parents gun owners I'm confused ""3.4% (the R0) population killed"" supposed mean. R0 measurement amount population killed, normal measure R0 percentage (and did, would 100% virus tending upwards growth) Italy's experience horrifying, even Bergamo certainly 3.4% population killed. spelled churches wrong. Yet everyone cited ""Swedish friend"" trusted? love seeing people like ""there vaccine coronavirus, therefore impossible"" like dude, no. reason like said, reason make one whole world wasnt working one like they're now. also able develop one sars 2003, finished testing bc virus died own. Bottoms taken seriously beginning. Atlanta shelter place order long state.

The problem Kemp issued order prevents local governments restrictions. Mask mandates aren’t actually allowed Georgia, it’s gotten point local leaders defying Kemp protect residents. predicted fall deaths continues. weeks, likely months Sweden could weekly fatality rate low neighbours. long use test-treat-isolate going forwards go sufficient mask usage retirement homes.

In end, still death toll 6-12 times higher neighbours. need unionize. Walt Disney rolling grave. There's compromise middle ground reason insanity.

Less 20. got ready. importantly 1)made masks wearing mandatory 2)we quick close bars, restaurants, gyms etc 3)we slow open bars, restaurants, gyms etc still opened, plans open beaches pools. 

So, ""think"" true. Chicago numbers trying keep down. quick turn back shut to. Illinois highest daily number 4000s. Florida recently hit 10,000. Florida's daily number \~500 cases daily hit end March. Illinois currently \~500 cases daily yesterday.

Covid vascular disease affects every organ body. We're seeing data coming showcasing may lifelong damage people survive disease. better idea common lasting damage is, caution warranted. cases started spike 2 weeks ago, change deaths, decline anything?

Good Bergamo! think consistent denialism among republicans *not* political issue?

They denied could ever happen excuse last first world country implement widespread testing. repeatedly state go away even take action. made refusals wear masks political statement. repeatedly said people willing sacrifice lives, lives elders, sake economic growth. list goes on.

Why issues considered political landscape? I'm willing believe social currents society experience high levels interaction therefore achieve high levels infection (certainly greater 20%) time isolated groups experience low levels infection. average may come 20 percent overall, think susceptibility virus among humans highly socially connected environment quite high. potential highways infection achieve immunity benefits society whole, society abandons measures therefore creates new highways infections re-emerge. 20% probably artifact social behavior anything intrinsic virus itself. 80% population naturally immune, never would propagated has. Outdoors safer increased air circulation, UV. 
Only UV-C rays kill virus - UV-A UV-B. exposed natural UV-C rays earth's ozone layer. sunlight get earth comprises UV-A UV-B rays. UV-C light obtained light artificial means (i.e. UV bulbs). power god protects them! /s Nuances right appreciated Possible threat = quarantined. 

Break quarantine = jail. 

This hard solution. law since cholera, smallpox, Spanish Flu, on.

So abide law fuck die. Either fine me. Laugh face, touch you, beat ever loving dog shit them. Maybe it'll send message? mean, option explored idiots? Florida man says, “get kids school we’re paying it” work pointless unless nation wear masks.

wow. He's one watch, gets covid, wonder much money they'll ask congregation help pay medical bills. Missouri requirements populated counties/cites . governor worthless, mayors trying. Indoors required. Outside gets tricky. think safely distance OK, you’re somewhere lot people like boardwalk outside bar, wear mask. **Note**: keep following closely Italian situation. last thread closed guess edits original title, though everything accurate t, trying translate Italian English also focus main news, otherwise “good news” flair seems kind weird (like time). Here’s hoping post stays time interesting valuable discussions last time, fact like exchange opinions information here, people make points informed way ask clarifications. best could literal title translation.

Note media focuses always bad news, instance particular case title leaves that: 1) 800 recovered, 2) total active cases keep decreasing, 3) 1/3 new cases comes antibody testing. \*That\* good news title leaves (how else would websites make page views otherwise?). Anyway, here’s hoping post stays. Although milestones previously identified reached good trend, wanted give general update week.

**Italian values peak** (end March): 4,000 ICUs, 28,000 hospitals, 700-900 daily deaths, 82,000 self-isolation, around 6,000 new daily cases, 105,000 active cases

**Today 07/08** currently active cases: 13,595 (of those, 8,460 Lombardy); 71 ICUs, 899 hospitals, 12,625 self-isolation mild symptoms without symptoms. 15 deaths, 193 new cases (as stated title).

Since February: Total cases: 242,149 total deaths: 34,914 total recoveries: 193,640

I keep updating good news milestones reached rather every day keep attention higher every day getting better better although occasional clusters far however contained.

Several regions reported **zero** new cases: Province Trento, Umbria, Sardinia, Aosta Valley Molise. **zero patients ICUs** Italian regions

Next milestones plausibly reached: 0 ICUs, less 500 hospitalized, day zero deaths, zero active cases Southern regions. think eliminated completely numbers high, optimistic go 10,000 active cases reach 0 several regions South. really wish countries took notes.

To answer questions asked previously: 1) antibodies level: studies North show prevalence, Bergamo likely around 50%. central-South regions local studies reported far 1-2% prevalence, herd immunity explain decrease. strict lockdown cautious reopening do, stopped virus North. 2) new cases, 1/3 antibodies, rest mild cases, cases remain high viral loads. Mandatory masks high levels compliance likely happens. 3) New clusters contained. Travel still subject quarantine countries. Flights Bangladesh banned yesterday Rome Fiumicino airport 30 passengers flight Dacca tested positive covid-19. 4) Italy, must test negative twice order declared recovered, takes weeks. applied number active cases would significantly lower.

EDIT: Spelling, grammar New law solve easy:

Churches pay taxes crisis over. USA#1  need work turnaround time. Waiting almost 10 days first potential sign infection useful.

You can't get STILL IT. immune system always activated keep reemerging nervous system causing shingles (and even so, still manages cause shingles sometimes). rest life. 

WTF? trolling point? God heal them. It’s good. Lol wut? This. Basically forced work go prison average small town churches fine, it’s ones thousands thousands visitors, think they’re called mega churches people (about 80%) recover disease without needing special treatment, majority – especially children young adults – illness due COVID-19 generally minor.

However, people cause serious illness. Around 1 every 5 people infected COVID-19 develop difficulty breathing require hospital care.""

This posted somehow ignored it.

As long term affects, said based several reports NY area, full data yet. POTUS casting shade him. Someone ask keyleigh mcmenace Look stock market bubble look tech stocks. Specifically take look Tesla. cautious locking country fear mongering two different things ''Over 40% respondents active psychiatric illnesses, 40.3% reported chronic fatigue problem, 27.1% met modified 1994 Centers Disease Control Prevention criteria chronic fatigue syndrome.''

40% quite big percentage think. Even 10% would terrible. long term consequences known yet (as chronic disease needs 6 months) Israeli doctors found mid term consequences 50% patients. 

Want take gamble mid term turn long term? Mankind might not. Me? will. I'm fragile shit. gonna last years us hiding houses, live never returning normal, can't it. 

Also I'm gonna wear mask outside hiking trail nobody around. Fuck that. natural selection about. Darwin awards everybody involved God punish Christians betrayal. live SA... want another quarantine. I'm personally hoping Oxford vaccine works September really help us immunize need like vulnerable front line workers we're well past holiday weekend I'd say there's really conclusion reached cases trending back down. there's real point freaking day two spiking numbers, focus bigger picture. God may work mysterious ways, virology pretty damned straightforward. Well long CEO got bonus government bailouts , everything seems pretty normal wonder would happen government implemented program give workers enough income monthly pay rent, bills, food also prohibited employers firing employees refused work due Coronavirus concerns.

I think see retail industry completely shut overnight, rightfully so. Retail workers front line, getting paid garbage, expected risk lives people buy new garbage need. Grocery stores one thing, stores selling luxury goods business open right now. fucking mess is. studies countries global health pandemic plays this? Around 40% Americans obese. wonder America coping bad. needs serious campaign Americans improve health diets future hope pandemic shocked lot people looking themselves. Medical treatment go far people don’t take action themselves. look diet Japan Asian countries, average diet consists rice, fish, meats vegetables much better overall health. Damn right I’m sorry. camel stupid I'm sure your's rhetorical question, day age would like ask dont believe climate change model concerned air quality. pollution? real, beginning thought would handled least somewhat decently 4+ months later it’s worse ever here. must vote murderous thugs out! almost 10% population. Can't put djinni back bottle. Mmmm Christ-like surely same, negative antibody tests also margins errors. However, though think level correlation give less plausible idea what's going on, despite presence big margins errors. two limb... body ain't right. Nah they've pushing lately. alternate phrase tactic ""just live it"" aka *just suffer die it*. Suffer die rich powerful goal. research (including this) shows situation plausible, hard say whether specific conditions apartment building hallway would make likely. virus particles fall floor get blown somewhere else, amount virus remains air enough get sick, would fine. feds withhold money states. That's offensive. dog able avoid situations put danger. Good them.

Now could get people Arizona, Florida, Texas follow example. Well, state sharp rise. I'm disappointed humans happy science proves right again. 1. Kids great maintaining PPE, washing hands, avoiding disease enabling behavior. part schools spread disease much. 
2. schools adhere adequate social distancing
3. 30+ people cramped classroom next dozens classrooms circulating other's air prime situation enable spread. 
4. spread get carried home. there, grocery store, work, etc. 

It's safe without stringent precautions logistically enable without spending lot money federal government want provide. Oh, sure; get that. something's motivating *believe* Coronavirus fake hoax flu; I'm saying shoes feel like would motivated believe people saying real thing dangerous, agony etc., vain. 

Hope makes sense. “We finally hitting numbers needed hit March, it’s *July*,” said Dr. Thomas Tsai, surgeon researcher Harvard co-authored testing analysis. “And interim, hundreds thousands new cases erupted.” could predicted administration consistently failed address substantial issues would abandon citizens like this? Nobody could seen coming.

^(edit: grammar) President? makes think ""pikachu face""? I’d hope American Academy Pediatrics advocating well. hey, that’s bunch Physicians, Bro old lol, there's like 9 billion people mofo glance first systematic review household clusters COVID-19 found 3/31 (10%) due child index case

That's high enough warrant concern.

Also keep mind still know long-term effects infection are. get back school, situation control first. Shoot space. think Elon Musk *agitated* lately unless also gras fed free range. believe saying coronavirus ""Cancelled"" lives IE killed people students going school I'd bet parents going back work. end hanging streets. even get fact NYC daily case rate less 1/100,000 right now. probably 1/1,000,000 September 1st (congrats them).

At point bending curve would change? Still unfortunate actions doesnt affect others associated him. ""Fake news!"" ""Liberal lies!"" ""China!"" Dude, [Fauci admitted Congressional testimony lied public snarky sarcastic hearing one point turned confrontational. Rep. David B. McKinley (R-W.Va.) asked Fauci whether regretted forcefully urged people wear masks late March, administration advising public consensus whether “Okay, we’re going play game,” said. “Let explain happened back then. time, paucity equipment health-care providers needed. … want divert masks PPE away used people. enough, recommend” wearing masks.""

Fauci's recommendation public wear masks, Spring, even though knew necessary safety.

Notice he's implying there's enough masks health care providers now. promoting woven-cloth masks if, claims, enough medical grade PPE everyone? truth there's still enough non-woven, blown-fiber masks health care providers, essential workers public use.

No one yet asked similar lies promoting woven cloth masks safe, even though we're similar situation: US mass producing even KN95 style masks stonewalling obvious fact could mass-order China. he's promoting practically useless masks safe that's easier saying ""we want public buy limited supply non-woven, blown-fiber masks government going anything expense unavailability right kind masks"". 

Fauci's still thing, except he's using slightly higher quality lie blaming everyone else credibility problems US health officials.

Today he's blaming ""polarization"" ""politicization"" coronavirus, per OP's post. [A couple weeks ago blaming ""anti-science"" people public health officials' lack people listening authorities anymore lies. he's liar #1 explained clearly. Thanks taking time that! Nevermind none protests coincided infection spikes, mask wearing high them. Whereas since day one churches COVID-19 Petri dishes, conservatives frequent throwing temper tantrums non-stop social distancing, mask requirements. book stores and/or cafes. entirely unplausible, read Bible. God harden people's heart (Israel) receive judgement many times. knows, maybe modern Christianity far along God mind decided fix it. 


Regarding whether God wants go Heaven, admit mouth. Oh shit victim Oh come 130,000 dead. cannot grasp this. Saying want wear mask right incorrect, least see someone might say that. ignorant selfish view, least semblance logic. 

I cannot understand wanting keep people wearing masks. Even decided right wear one, would deny someone else opportunity make decision, too??

I suppose pastor, sounds like power/control thing. plenty people this, too. China already wrote playbook January Asain countries followed back then. states biggest protests ones spikes right now, Minnesota, Washington etc fine. known time outdoors activities lower risk, Japanese study says 19 times safer indoors. Little Caesars thing family got child I've always special place heart it. love real, actual, good pizza though I'll take look pizza subreddit.

playing gotcha whether individual viruses poor *candidates* herd immunity thru whidespread infection change whether wrong *definition* herd immunity (Which we're actually talking about).

Here, i'll go first- sure, chicken pox poor candidate herd immunity thru active infection vaccine instead available, vaccine, that's chicken pox parties common doctor-recommended practice vaccine.

Can admit wrong definition herd immunity including infection tactic? *are* wrong, that's actually talking about, yet keep focusing chicken pox hiv instead herd immunity. actually talking individual viruses definition concept mis-using, want dicker around ""bUt ChIcKeN pOx hIv!"" land. individual viruses case example try walk thru refuse acknowledge herd immunity actually is. 

**Forget individual viruses. Herd immunity conferred thru herd widespread prior infection. Full stop. part definition. wrong.**  feeling Coronavirus daily death reaching highest US whole too. 3 4 week death lag longer younger people. late last week, 4,487 tests conducted across four testing sites specifically protesters resulted 62 positive cases COVID-19, positivity rate 1.4%, department health system Minnesota, HealthPartners, tested 8,500 protesters several clinics positivity rate overall positivity rate Minnesota currently 3.6% 3.7%, according health official. 

I'm sure trying get at. Contact tracing what? determine spread it? begin with. infection rate among protestors lower overall infection rate Minnesota. Natural selection. following clip Prince Egypt mind last night - seems good place post it: 

This Final Plague - one killed firstborns Egyptians Biblical story Moses. interesting animated rush air... sounds breath. 

You know, book churchgoers read time - supposed - got pretty interesting stuff it. stuff pride hubris leader bring horrific, incomprehensible consequences his/her followers. Especially double wrong path! mean, guess book written bunch dead Middle Eastern guys maybe write off, huh? message could *possibly* still deliver readers book 3,500 years later huh? message... indeed. That's true. Sorry fall left wing media lies. entirely unplausible, read Bible. God harden people's heart (Israel) receive judgement many times. 


Regarding whether God wants go Heaven, admit mouth. appreciate natives protecting already fragile communities. Montana. closed reservation overlaps Glacier National Park people complain able access entire park.

 love things good folks entitled protect necks. know Karen's got able vacation freely right?

Our state going get bad we're tourism state summer.

 matter quick maffs figure good combo Montana. care though because: ""We're small sparsely populated"" less 10% estimate accurate. Herd immunity occurs roughly 70%, assuming produce sufficient antibodies. Pre-existing conditions everything corona. idiot can't see significance. someone could seen coming... Looks like we’re track 100,000 cases day, Fauci predicted. kind graduate program do? curious bc neuroscience labs paid us teach two times. distinctions possible funding sources U.S. foreign students ... good questions seeing advertised reserved frontline workers ones know simultaneously argue:

1. hoax
2. Death rates low
3. protesters' fault

That's right, even pick one. argue three even though they're contradictory. Why? time act back march. witnessing downfall country sadly. live Arizona horrified acting this. went different places witness little people affected this. change life slow witnessing psychology test put action. people act responsibility given little information lacking leadership? answer surprisingly no. blessed learn college, also know information I've obtained shared less 10% total population. didnt background would probably boat everyone else... see trends two week scale county map tracker  
  


Arizona, Florida, Texas, California looking hot. I'm little surprised California, seemed control flattened curve. states, I'm little less surprised given seem proactive responses. Yeah, account fact lot leadership outside maybe tech industry relies ""butts seats"" prove working. getting work done ever since set flexible hours get constantly interrupted extroverts want chat, leadership worried we're slacking since cannot see us every day submit itemized lists daily tasks call logs. soon allowed back office, be.

What I'd like see end stupid open plan office. terrible idea was. I'd follow favipiravir want put hopes alternative. Right on!!!!!!!
If gold would give right now. keep seeing articles headlines like **CORONAVIRUS FOUND HITCHING RIDES POLLUTION**, panic inducing AF, read article like yeah, virus get stuck shit floating air, it'll never make sick.

Responsible communication ought focus exclusively new research impacts safe behavior. example we're thinking cleaners back. means wait hour re-enter house, say so. means can't safely people house yet, say that.

""We used special machine keep covid alive air hours"" great all, useless public safety discussions. TrYiNg 🎻  Fair points. Anyway, feel like I’m nitpicking, appreciate good news regardless. 👍 Bro...go worship Orange King! spike New York. sure talking about. bet it’s impossible get tested.

Nope, spreads far far easily indoors. fact changed. forgot sauna cold shock therapy bro!!!!!!!! Sure COVID?

Since infections come risk death serious, sometimes lasting health problems want prevent many infections vaccine available, according Dr. Fauci could soon winter. According article, rose 65.1 66.9, 1.5% increase 1 month. Technically, though, Christian thought Jesus sacrifice (the final sacrifice) Communion commemoration sacrifice wine standing blood bread standing body. Catholics take step transubstantiation.

Moving Denver next month. two comments made happy read. sad part alot students rely sports scholar ships. highschool football team, alot teammates worked really really hard specifically college scholarships. imagine schools closing sports down, make really hard people. hard put mask I’m really religious I’m going avoid religious debate. expect reactions.

Every degree away optimal beer mouth. /s needs be, understand people want sacrifice pandemic. lock throw away key. reread thread comments. re-read seem neither understand conversation specific comment. I'm responding someone says zero information virus. plenty information virus viruses class. Additionally single sentence comment seemed respond fact virus goes away body kicks it. nothing fact damage happens body fighting virus. Certainly damage happen. virus gone, damage ceases increase damage done done. never said anything people getting sick bad outcomes.

Additionally, better participate conversation. Saying one 25 year old healthy woman significant lung damage contributes nothing conversation. Quantify source points want make. percentage people permanent lung scarring? significant scarring? impact daily lives? get information? Vague boogeymen useless feel bad writing it. gets geniuses think people keep going work dinner movies malls everybody getting badly sick around them. surprised see NC's hospitalization numbers continuing inch slowly acceleration. 22% last month, period TX quadrupled, AZ tripled, GA doubled, even neighbor SC doubled. Still heading wrong direction, though.  another 30 years nature us!  heard ""its hoax"" believe mean hype hoax, virus exists, over-hyped.  


Number deaths continue drop, true.  


I mean protestors fault, hard get mad someone meeting friends supporting massive rally millions people. Can't arms protests, mad others disease point view, (even agree one cause, disagree another). would nice Canada levels per capita testing. thing 99.999999999999 percent people recover.

Do know death rate corona? [Question] [US] work casino open month. They've recently disclosed staff employee coronavirus. I'm terrified getting myself, worse, bringing home family. I'm also afraid income/being eligible unemployment due turning work. anyone know affect claim unemployment? possible could fired uncomfortable go back work? That's happens think entitled. Someone gladly took job bet  mask shortages Putting PR fire? done remarkable job shown really shown countries deal global pandemic. US atleast stand proud dealt virus sure churches messed up, article says 650 cases linked. Funny they're bashing churches nothing said thousands millions protestors congregating.  Really??? Twitter epidemiologists thing last week. lie would they???? Mother isn’t going like can't argue even simple math science Trumpettes. sound Fake News Alarm bots come running dumbass defence. I'm sure parts country different Maryland schools crazy overcrowded, trailers outside overflow. exactly plan cutting class sizes 10-15 room 30 right now? Without developed nations social safety net, us shuffle public work face eviction relate increase testing? per capita basis US ranked near top globally countries 10+ million citizens. Yes, tried talk us cancelling - asthma. way! ended getting refund yikes. shouldn’t disclose medical condition get refund travel state global pandemic cases increasing exponentially state mandating travelers self-quarantine 14 days go there.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* I’m saying deaths dropping, saying trust Florida Texas’s number much trust China’s. explain protests contagious Florida, Texas, Arizona, Georgia, nowhere else?  Dude, DISCOVERED concept herd immunity noticed enough children **caught recovered from** measles Baltimore community, drove transmision disease. literally observed infection-conferred herd immunity first instance. concept CAME ya dingus.

When measles vaccine came out, people already measles get vaccinated, herd immunity obtained thru combination recovered infected people vaccinations. people born 1957 get measles vaccine already caught measles, already immune ALSO participate herd immunity today. 

Again, demonstrably WRONG. Meh - he’s trying sell product even though knows there’s little value people come office space. Thank you, I'm really sorry situation well. hr lady tried force resign refused, made clear wanted continue work remotely want they'd need fire me. able get unemployment. would def recommend quitting, make sure fire get unemployment. ok find job cares wellbeing. Best luck! Fair point. ""Literate assumptions"" then? risk getting viruses activity almost zero. However, there's non-zero physical-risk driving car highway motorists. She’s qualified Congress guy  Oh got pay cut didnt get bonus year already. Im sure next year might give back call raise. Christians listen teachings Jesus. follow teachings jooz. Unless take account Jesus basically progressive rabbi, hateful Christians love quote Leviticus. let fuck up. can’t argue stupid narcissists become even so. Neat fake news article. compares cases, deaths per million. tries use America's superior testing (thus finding cases) say Trump's response best.

Compare death rates friend :) answer. devil, why. grand father like figure throne. It’s collective us  hard say. That’s stupid defeats purpose bubble.

Glad Manitoba isn’t candidate. College football probably happen simply many schools need money college football generates them. Flattened vertically nuts lazily stupid? Mom dad charged murder. Damn covid 10 *laughs american* heard yesterday 75% NYC parents wanted schools open. Seriously. insane. trying make situation worse? threatening lives every man, woman, child state

It's Florida citizens he's put danger. tons tourists visiting returning home states. ~~retailers~~ minimum wage employees enforce mask policies anyways

There, fixed you.

There stories people getting fucking assaulted (or shot) trying refuse service someone without mask. taking risk 7.50/hr?  shoes, shirt, mask, service. 19 Damn that’s actually travesty. Human brains don’t operate nearly well temperatures far room temp. Please tell you’re Canadian getting elastic? Try cutting elastic replacing ribbon tie behind head instead. Organized religion cancer edited comment. getting ad wouldn’t let scroll anymore. refreshed browser saw rest article. User error. :) definitely different senario there

Hard compare two *at all* we’ve smashed two quarterly goals home havent seen one office year. makes sense right... somebody said we'd 60,000 cases max moved goalposts again. guidance feds/ lack compliance population/ cherry top: governor odds state congress entire time. 

He's literally sued person running November

Edit add: feel like NC eventually join states Trainwreck course. ignorant governor. He's trying losing slower places. maybe mortality rate kids low, even debates kids give adults.

Fuck information repeat CNN says  Lord giveth (corona) So? say COVID SARS mortality. say Israeli doctors say. 

In Germany starting specialised clinics treat long term effects. knowledge starting get now. 

0.3%? 3x flu? That's hopeful! Well rhyme doesn’t work America instead humanity. originally let’s laugh industry never... 
We disagree last part. agree can't treat everyone, healthcare can't treat everyone. mask. rules distance measures together. parties normal gatherings. Continuous reduced operating capacity businesses. mean even discussion whether children go school normally again. everything put together. think viable solution create new kind society 0.6% people possibly dying.

That suggesting insanely grim. think worse keep postponing keep looming threat might saved 2 years vaccination. saved is. quickest vaccination development took 4 years.

 think already lost. 

If government people eventually stop, can't keep up, atleast view. cases inevitably rise case lockdowns accepted anymore.

Than flattening curve first place maybe dubious.

I think save lives eventually creating society makes people unhappy. think would save QALY's end making holy war accepting harsh pretty miserable defeat.

I think indefinitely flattening curve waste QALY's although feels deontologlically just.

Ira Helsloot someone also proposes inevitably cost QALY's example. Lockdowns weren’t necessary? See also: water wet Trudeau looks damn fine beard agree. looked comments almost missinformed time read article myself. damn fault pandemic wiped 75% demand ( 95% peak)?

While agree complacency industry, would’ve happened airline - even spectacularly well run one fantastic customer service.

It sounds like you’re saying “well deserved,” little bit mean spirited given actually suffer (front line mid-level employees well customers).

In short term, depressed demand result aggressive cost cutting survival. cost cutting enable airlines reduce capacity scale demand, streamline operations adopt leaner, agile structures - probably make profitable genuine recovery kicks gear next year. big ones survive likely thrive - even lingering impacts business travel, etc,

For rest us, crisis make pleasant travel experience long run - trust that. Higher fares, fewer flights, fewer options, crowded planes maximize margins, etc. linger well beyond Covid. 

So yeah. Kind shitty around. Boy, it’s good thing Coronavirus doesn’t spread protests riots. Otherwise, might see real spike cases.  I’m sorry. That’s really shitty. really bringing terrible people are. might part areas reported ton new cases yesterday held holiday delay getting results lab. Worldometer disclaimer yesterday's cases LA county assigned previous days.

It seems like John's Hopkins that.

In case, expect soon 60k day new normal. course could go higher that, 60k seem nice comparison. Time tell. “In Quebec, residents left days soiled diapers, going hungry thirsty, 31 residents found dead one home less month, leading accusations gross negligence. Ontario, military found shocking conditions five homes: cockroaches rotten food, blatant disregard infection control measures, treatment residents deemed “borderline abusive, abusive.” normally agree getting quite close ""clearly dangerous"" side spectrum.

The problem is, enough people exist finding validate other's nonsense. instead one kooky person continually rebuked real life, entire subreddit/Facebook group/Discord ""We must something!"" morons. seeing beliefs shared power. Even Kanye made comment vaccines mark beast. nonsense becoming problem.

I respected rights Intelligent Design morons speak, rights flat earthers moon landing hoaxers because, general, topics harmless. Antimasker/antivaxxer/scared everything white same/ people actually dangerous I'm less inclined defend rights speech. started watched Contagion nights later watched Outbreak. chuckled little bit Outbreak since antagonist actively trying stop cure... thought “that far fetched!”. It’s almost shocking real life paralleled movies. I’m glad particular virus takes weeks kill rather within hours exposure. mean, stronger approach leadership. Denying funding school state, more.

I'm going waste time looking statues, might able remove positions, revoke Miami-Dade's status, making unincorporated terrority again. Obviously non going happen, likely national guard forcing schools open. knew raise kindness heart. figured upcoming mass exodus teachers willing part spread explanation seems likely. waited 8 days PBC, friend waited 10. definitely looking week+ old test results, last couple days. 25% entire state infected covid, would expect could many 25% covid hospitalizations covid primary cause issues. But, 2% state carrying active disease, number drops 2%. believe point pandemic, crosstalk low enough negligible. trump post taken down. think important topic lot kids could get sick. state March already outbreak school wife going home school (not online learning thru school) 5 9 year olds. cases show death rate lower lower. Cases rarely equal cause death. Even CDC saying death rate getting low may even qualify epidemic. So, hope states already legitimate first wave, seemingly flattened curve (like northeast)? destined like Florida months time? know virus gone anywhere, chance states (relatively) okay? possible keep rate infections low enough overwhelm hospitals, pipe dream? La county baby number 1! People need go eat restaurant go bar huh? don’t get fair texas GOP able thing, apparently choosing He’s talking Ron DeSantis! Hopefully glad think way, 17 Ive forced go whole life.

Im total loss reason PhD scientist training, vastly different non-biological field. Could please recommend resources one learn understand better? Something covers basics, paper abstract scare away we're hovering right around 30%, Pence comes today says ""Arizona's positive rate flattening"", try spin dumpster fire state positive. Last week way go fishing passed Carolina Beach. 3 100 wearing masks would surprised. really living repercussion investing education next  scary &amp; makes wonder ever change US. seems need total reform world work USA. US employer holds nearly cards lives. TMC Houston surge capacity right now. 38% ICUs' beds, ""sustainable surge"" included, covid say. Except strangely labeled think 38% 38% total Phase 2 ICU surge capacity.

They 615 Covid-19 patients 749 non-covid-19 patients ICUs right now. They're 80% Phase 2 surge capacity. this, I'd say 45% ICU patients Houston's TMC Covid-19. 55% non-covid.

On June 30th, 35% ICUs' patients covid-19. (480 covid-19 1350 total ICU beds occupied June 30th).

7-8 immunity thing vaccine never comes, NZ end screwed end too. brasil one place would want live circumstance. pres worse ours! Florida right? Look test positivity rates, currently reliving April warmer part country. They're making Olympic sport anti-intellectualism. Small Government™ Right, save one life going church months, worshiping socializing online. right call. mean, even close call either. give break.

If lived time vaccine within grasp society, different, don't. figure out. I'll answer using counter argument point coming incredibly narrow even sure could construe anything last response attack you

You going circles discussing somebody online, simply commented article, Fauci divert Fact. 

In regards standards academics follow

The credibility source something makes hate them, make outraged, irritate annoy me, anything opinions anything life, people either stick fact not. People literally free follow whatever standards exist nation, workspace culture. 

I'll happily explain reformulate comment people want challenge it. People general say want lives depends factual nature saying, statements par. Chronic lung infection common ailment grand scheme things, cold light history gonna loving Fauci. worked Sweden? (Genuinely asking) I’d argue Brazil Sweden handled worse. every country better isn’t saying much. man culture indeed giving wife :/ don’t get don’t understand *get* beds available want need one? Fuck no. way talk beds instead lowering infections kills me. Protesting didn’t help surge either. Seems like fingers pointing everything else. Yeah, certainly look less scary, mean..

look, got Arizona building temp. hospitals, got Gov. Texas warning death rates masking up, got well known cycle infection hospitalization ICU Death (and death reporting delay)

One thing horrifies lack competency, management risk completely absent, people die global pandemics given, response. game chicken, virus, blink magical, take measures addressed. overload areas US lower caseloads areas Canada testing.

The testing done asymptomatic cases caught. We’re winning race become biggest losers. guy said April needed opening guy disclose conflict interests think he's auditioning spot WH coronavirus task force. LOL Yeah, super hot days pretty much write-offs recall. hard enough get kids concentrate they're stewing juices extra desperate get building. Thankfully, school year MN starting Labor Day ending shortly Memorial Day, ton days bad. Gotta keep providing answers til get one people accept. matter prior answers prove lying point.

I’m terrified don’t know make living otherwise. southwestern Ohioan, agree. hell well educated professionals decades experience, sacrifice hard work resumes, giving unsolicited advice ?  
At time nation's history God speaks president wise advice leadership tweet away, allow tempted medical devil-speak. *insert name EVERY country here* handled coronavirus outbreak better United States did.  Threaten huge fines well *spread Covid. Cthulhu probably already it. He’s around forever. That's true said people every state living near major cities. almost 1000 test sites state can't speak well distributed rural population compares states rural areas. far cry ""people Texas can't even get tested,"" though. develop pontifications adhere them.

The irony. Never voted guy, sure will. shown excellent leadership covid I'm proud him. I'm sure much dissolution liberal party seen making covid bipartisan/political issue. imagine level stress daily press briefings since beginning taking questions media. yes... ""chemical concoctions"".

Why bring anti-vaxxer nonsense this?  money pool public health regulations required footwear stores restaurants, can't public health regulations require masks?

When public safety requires people cross street crosswalks, can't public safety require people wear masks?

edit: oh, way: masks required Spanish Flu, people cited wearing masks. Using dogs know get COVID-19 may create mutated virus attacks dogs. nuts respect people never got/or get unemployment. 

So left without income time too. 

Plus anyone service industry getting massively screwed right now. friends find second/third jobs... also NYC one state already mid lockdown, 3 seperate states properly locked back yet. Leviticus looks like health code take another look it. 

Like back legit reason eating pork, bugs, rabbits. still is, we're better able clean animal get rid parasites diseases people never think wrong.......much less admit it. Pence better get messaging line Father saying. article also states quote Fauci saying *some* deaths *may* also said. since dead aren’t tested, it’s impossible know exactly many due covid many due illnesses. That’s far cry “specifically states people dying home (other) medical conditions...” 

He also followed mentioning death certificates take time get reported it’ll take time determine many deaths excess well many directly related Covid-19. 

So I’m sure cases people neglecting seek treatment conditions due fear covid-19, seriously doubt accounts even half excess home deaths seeing. LA county seem always backlog always blame backlog? movie theater bowling alley still closed + people going eat shop. Yea, remember Republican Nancy Pelosi encouraging people hug Asians. Eh question arrows actually help. passing someone cart really high risk? lol, get lot that. Honestly, teacher I'd looking work. plays Rugby #9. Put shovel! work state Florida attorney courts system similar situation going on... courtrooms opening up, many taking advantage videoconferencing infrastructure place. office working remotely months, able office work easily laptops home, required return working in-person next week. 

It's really weird watch office go protective us, seemingly reacting sort directive get asses back seats. Even though we've multiple people test positive virus ""skeleton crew."" Well said. medical conglomerate going make billions survivors disabling lifelong health conditions Greenland? notice florida governor lacking tests average citizens know subreddit meme land tolerant alcoholics /r/Coronavirus drunk. Looks like downvoters wrong. Sorry didn’t fit narrative today chill think second see why. First can't mass vaccinate whole country week. take time go stages. vaccine reached critical saturation, continue careful. everyone stops distancing day vaccine announced finished new spike wait distribution. 

And even long term studies potential vaccines. may work well distribution stop new side effects discovered. example Swine flu vaccine used Sweden 2009 turned Narcolepsy possible side effect. Something like 500 Swedish teenagers ended narcolepsy used vaccine developed record time. 

So yeah tey going want take staged approach this, giving vaccine sensitive groups first carefully studying effects field, ready pull breaks soon adverse effect shows up. everyone stopped careful situation may new wave already process decide hold vaccinations critical issue solved. 

It could disaster. Giving whole country vaccine might take year. time measures remain place. agree keeping kids home better option possible. Distance learning good regular school, kids going get regular school experience year matter what. 

My kids early elementary, rules would follow next year sound tiring scary young kids. Even kids go person getting two in-person days per week start, knows long since superintendent already said expects closures. 

Also send kids, would careful physical contact them? young need hugs, want view exposure risk. 

Consistent work home seems much better stressful hodgepodge. realize everyone keep kids home, manage somehow seems like obvious choice. That's impression want people have, mission accomplished. 

The problems run much deeper unfortunately. Like restaurants example, places open 1/2 capacity outdoors.. enough customers. staff ends underpaid, followed suppliers getting less money, end way farms. now, majority new cases centre country. used north eastern part Romania severe lockdowns, quarantine lot tests performed we're lot better moment life pretty terrible it’s devastating watch uncontrolled pandemic play country. feel much worse state’s shelter place order. know anyone else, Karen's I've known self-loathing anti feminist misogynist women. I'm sure are, strong thread running group. Something wife noticed too. Entire family healthier since schools closed we're stuck home. logical explanation: jesus wants dead. Mandatory testing everyone, NOW. Anyone symptoms positive gets quarantined 2 weeks minimum fined $1000 violations. Easy way compltely eradicate virus state... county plus immediate neighbours! would comparable Italy done. FMLA applies locations 50 employees. 30 people work place business exempt abiding FMLA rules fire you. Plus worked 12 months making FMLA claim serious illness lasts least 3 days diagnosed doctor. parents become eligible given kids get sick bounce back day two anyway. Maybe consider Bergamo 122k inhabitants NY 8200k. Maybe. Like N95 right? get one? Lol read 500-1000 papers? even read 10,000 papers day, mean smart proper actions.Seems like realize statistics work.Get education dude.Because read lot, mean expert smart.Stop living denial dude. R’amen got talked shit wearing mask old friend followed gem bill gates conspiracy theory. 

The pandemic basically climate change high speed.... bunch idiots know lied foxnews. fundamentally dishonest. can't speak Bay Area

You obviously can't. don't. people kids want work home. I'm guessing reddit people without.l kids skew greater.

Extroverts bosses also want work home. 

I think people work home certainly ly end office. Honestly, even sleep night point? Yeah, thanks info. I’ll wait till trumps office believe would force vaccine get reelection. Call crazy! like he’s done anything like already. Lmao! thing happened NY. love God, move past Iodonnis ""it's flu"" meta analysis early May?

Head r/COVID19 look IFR studies estimating 0.5%-1%.

134,000 dead right 40% year's worth infection despite life altering infectious disease policies social awareness. Flu averages 35,000 free spread, open schools sports, people going work sick.

Stop. Stop Iodonnis ""research"" early may. concerned getting sick roommate, get one. legal right make get tested weekly. That's great news. Congrats Here: may bit dense, comments usually helpful. would matter? Federal govt tell towns handle local public health issues? 10 million residents, largest US, think scale issues. 

Of course backlog probably continues point they'll announce another backlog tests today, find ignore backlog comments, kinda cancel out, look trend, and.. yeah good.. Gotta love knucklehead Governer Okay guess wrong say every week can't increase capacity all? best do? meant gas chainsaw...limited I'm ottawa; active cases 50 implemented mandatory public masks. went grab food yesterday everyone masks on! 

Go Canada! Yes 1st grade teacher, regularly get spit coughed accident. kids also touch everything put fingers mouths without thinking it. It’s also going impossible socially distance I’m trying teach kids read. It’s completely different situation supermarket. real daily number due releasing backlog one day? definitely different. taken back flippant person replied grocery workers. guess redditors general comment grocery store workers got downvoted fair amount. news, sky blue. Stupid people screw always hate smart people stay trouble. quick google stroke symptoms man came trying make America great again

It obvious everyone never intention, remotely capable leading country world. Let alone one. There's elementary school road finally able expand three story building could away trailers back. imagine would like schools start back. know primary school used volunteer bring subs time divide kids among several teachers (which nightmare itself). Twinkle toes seems go to. :P said, ""It’s federal law, can’t fired staying home sick child. Yes don’t pay you, can’t fire you."" 

I telling 10 years working retail saw dozens people get fired exactly that. always disguised something else, everyone knew called much gone. 

We talking people worried losing jobs dismissed fear law gets sidestepped companies time. law good job protecting people. would agree FMLA better anything, dismiss people's fears law silly. want say good, gullible good people infected association. Though choose knowing full well consequences. Guess I’m torn issue. Colleges followed Ivy’s lead started, let’s see they’ll follow governments. Same. totally get children need physically present school benefit rich learning environment build social bonds, risk high. would risk (albeit small one) future harm child kawasakis disease, would potential expose older relatives well.

Real tough decision, going get worse action taken. think California posted 11k positive tests today too. Yes one party running headlong fascism, corrupt open, denying science, accelerating climate change, endangering American lives, colluding hostile foreign nations...but party wants tax everyone little give everyone healthcare education, they're bad, really. :/  kids die flu! /s Lol kayne trump promoting dangerous conspiracy theories regarding COVID 19 mean Cthulhu currently social distancing better majority United States? do. 

They also, law, need wearing masks. 

And didn’t say couldn’t protest. 

I think they’re self-harming idiots. Lol. article following categories bar chart:

Nah, we’ll get herd immunity like 80% total. It’d less, nobody’s anything protect them. School ""free daycare"" safe place put kids required law presence adult. sure working parents somehow became bad guys. people tolerate this? much worse. Thank god monsters deserve everything get Another partial full year online learning certainly ideal, incredible people think negatives somehow outweigh accelerating outbreak historic pandemic. Yes, person learning going much much better, information available home ever before. Teach kids keep safe shit eventually over. think depends crowded store is, really. I've seen work, store pretty sparse, find hindrance. acceptable job best, much better expected. call Aang 1 man army (and diplomatic corps)? deaths increasing Florida Texas. Woodwinds require lot air brass need lot leave puddles spit behind. I'm really hoping figured time son goes school. see, Iasi sounds like. Thanks good luck friends would regularly get norovirus least twice year first grader. hard teach kids basic hygiene? remember total germaphobe ten.. reason find Japanese would totally pull off.

Saw concerts bands enjoyed near silence performances awesome. McDonalds bought old Timmies coffee supplier. want original tim hortons coffee, hit mcdeadcows. now...  hope so. would second civil war. God hate country sometimes Something something, practicing preach. outside month. Swedish population individual basis social distancing extent much US (with strong healthcare infrastructure). Look Japan even stronger example, similar situation plus masks. Even governmental response weak, people matters. think governments response poor (and numbers reflect relative immediate neighbours), citizens simply reduced interactions significantly. 

Sweden Ireland neck neck deaths/population, Sweden outpaced us. think Swedish population infrastructure much better built social distancing healthcare quality, Irish government response better facilitating crushing curve. Otherwise we'd look like cultural brethren England Northern France.

Also, trust China's numbers second (the government horrifying autocratic state), government went harder lockdowns pretty much anywhere else. makes sense ""slammed"" much smaller overall extent we're defining many places. could assholes pay employees anyway? money that. would take walmart target nationwide- masks would mandatory within hours. think contact tracing good option jobs teachers want alternative short term. Agree. I'm happy stepped right thing. naughty boy countries gone serious lockdown. countries need strong lockdown (although definition. people consider South Korea lockdown several shops publics places schools closed) precisely countries masks use always high. really wasn’t limiting teachers. Reading comments saw mention healthcare professionals well. really thinking workforce whole. rebound would benefit millennials opportunities certain sectors. 

There people crazy high risk thing it’s smart decision self quarantine much possible hoping vaccine.

Guess wasn’t negative enough though. It’s easier catch downvotes sub catch coronavirus! Maybe read wrote, teaching lessons homework. never taught married teacher. Nice thought study deaths way average. Like Texas 55%. 

Let guess... looking spot behind podium? guys get along with

Enough enough bullshit! lot things forcefully opened should. Schools main question. I’m one semester away bachelors degree, even NYC, I’m physically going classes regardless “they” say. I’ll take online classes I’m 1000% sure physical life isn’t risk. ironic thing would lose entire life quest furthering life education...

For younger don’t option online learning, well we’ll see. can’t trust “they” “they” whoever “they” poorly handled pandemic. hope history books don’t leave countless bad decisions made set entire world back months. lockdown 4eva crowd obviously hasn’t seen impact lockdowns state local budgets.

Like Gov Whitmer Michigan right? Oh wait...she told Trump fuck threw hissy fit Twitter realized authority. control flow federal school funds incentivise preferred course action. Hey... that's bad idea, actually.

A good part next Presidential administration's job cleaning pandemic, preparing next one, generally right thing people US.

Anyone feel like Biden/Fauci ticket would work? ""Hey you, sounds like fun.. none sir."" Sometimes ""available beds"" misleading. staff cannot always accommodate patients. Bringing beds solve problems. Staff gets longer shifts run short PPE. Patients moved Lombardy first, northern Italy, entire Italy.

Even abroad, Germany took example one confused bud. people infected, die. hard understand?!  Hitchens spinning grave numbers referring hospital patients, ICU. It’s incredibly funny me. I’ve seen large number people past days post Facebook “Jesus died us” later post “I’m wearing mask, health isn’t responsibility.”

Classic stuff. Way follow lead. Truly one knows body respond one safe severe symptoms. lot rituals surrounding food preparation meals prescribed Torah Rabbinical interpretations Torah. 

Basically, order food kosher, animals healthy slaughtered clean humane way (by standards people modern slaughter equipment). Fruits vegetables carefully inspected insects cleansed them, pork (the meat needs cooking destroy diseases may carry) allowed all. meat insects (as in, rotting) salt throw stew hope alright like many others would time; throw out, insects kosher. 

Pots pans need maintained carefully supposed use pot meat use dairy, end keeping good track kitchen conscious food preparation potential cross-contamination. Also ideally, washing hands cooking case handled meat dairy last meal one. 

At mealtime, supposed wash hands eating, need wash dishes well again, want cross-contaminate meat dairy next meal can't afford two sets dishes. 

It's kind stuff, plus lot hygeine laws. TL;DR, traditional Jewish law requires wash hands conscious eating put body, cuts significantly disease within community. Title made go “no yes” stats weight/BMI 65? COVID seems brutal co-morbidities obesity cardiovascular diseases. brought friend. virus doesn’t give single fuck weather temperature. spread easily summer imagine damage it’s going cause fall winter. Remember! Less testing = less cases. hope Americas able follow soon (I know sounds impossible, guy dream). He'll piece turd till end. anything like Houston they'll say 0 say ""we it!"". Everybody handled better United States. like CEO donates salary get bump stock right sell shares? hasn’t changed right. keep hearing Florida governor talk death rate low healthy young people fine they’re ones spreading get question who’s filling ICU units it’s young people healthy getting getting ...the governor Florida doesn’t want address that. want change people SHOW young people ages vent American churches always shock money grabbing are.  That’s going happen. populous country already worst leadership prevent reoccurring. makes despise people trump fucking moron, oklahoma wear mask everywhere. 90% wearing mask inside grocery store get dirty looks, even older dude say ""what's age? Mid twenties? scared flu"" 

I expect trump trump feel like I'm another universe bad dream ordinary people get triggered wear mask.....I'm always speechless Well I'll give kudos admitting anger management therapist called anger management issues.

I think wrong cause people life like mean parents are.

Not sure assume worst parents want go back work. That's another bad habit assuming worst people drive anger something thst might even true. Probably mad saying something therapists dint teach should.

Guess neither us know unless study something. can’t help remembering months ago virus would “going away” summer heat. Yet life Arizona now. 

I’m Florida seems like local state govt areas seem denial, far behind you. 

Good luck everyone! Well, took 28 days us go 2 3 million, based lack changes many states still rising, since late August 28 days away, would like argue it’s likely hit 4 million end July. That’s 20 days 50k+ cases needed, seem reaching every day. Holy shit!!! new cases surpassing new recoveries!! Fuck!! likely. already teacher shortage, really need ""make room"" young teachers. way salary schedule set up, get benefit bump. lot movement upwards schools. move administration, additional degrees certifications. think many viruses running free Africa almost impossible establish died Covid died something else, many places resources test deaths January, agree. Oh, US contractors. Ok, case I'll agree. huge market, excluded go broke. mean, look China. Huge assholes. still deal cause money. Also, serious systemic issues handling long term care homes, pandemic exposed, people feel great deal shame. fair amount confidence lot change, officials along spectrum work change it. Bullshit. know SINGLE parent thought distance learning grand adventure children. fact, parents talked despised it, included. Teachers stay...we need get pandemic first. Universal, Busch Gardens, Sea World reopened June 11- yet everyone's freaking Disney. fuck even going parks right now?! fucking stupid!!! Well fuck sideways, don’t say!

Even bystander/child could figure locking staying locked occurred. look Italy, Spain, UK, NYC ask question - virus surges Florida, virus act different locations? DeSantis end guy prioritizied politicial ambition businesses opening health safety citizens - nothing cautionary tale. Still shitty illusion safety. One party one single person comes sick infect dozens even hundreds people. infected people might interact thousands students single test comes back positive. described blatantly unconstitutional, violation medical autonomy Federal funding makes &lt;10% funding schools, rest usually allocated property taxes local taxes  play devil's advocate here. would keep campaign websites up?

-Trump Also tested nearly double amount people YTD.

Tests

Oregon: 275,727

AB: 493,935 actually removed part worried covid. also explicitly said okay watch mass home even reopen worried catching it. 

That's diocese least. I'm getting downvoted making exact comment made daily discussion. People want hear guess. guess long die fine end ICU while... They're raiding steal miracle cure themselves. better Canada regarding face masks. Karens Kevins. Trump wants stake easy understand, 
but irresponsible position first. wants somebody else one say no.

He wants children go back school. could that? must Democrats deep state preventing children getting education. opening happen protests? current spike aligned timeline protests?  Exactly. anything, worst time Arizona heat. cools down, activities outside. Also couldn’t sued endangering workers right something like that? HALF issues president make political, would wear mask cohesive policy national, state local levels. remember, matters Americans freedom choose healthcare insurance... wether get medical care. huge /s  year never ends...

Yes goes on, friend... Sure, think way NOW, back radical concept set apart.   know ramped production PPE yet. hate leadership. :( people ""let's wait another day declare pandemic, astronauts iss yet infected"" Hmm? PREFACE: *much* theming design thrills. love roller coasters, Six Flags/Cedar Pointification (tallest/fastest/mostest all) kind bores point.

1. Star Wars: Rise Resistance (Disneyland, Disney's Hollywood Studios). Caveat: *really* looking forward riding year, everything I've seen ride-through videos puts top list despite personal experience recommendation. completely new experience attraction design philosophy.

2. Haunted Mansion (Disneyland, Magic Kingdom)

3. Hagrid's Magical Motorbike Adventure (Universal Islands Adventure)

4. Superman: Krypton Coaster (Six Flags Fiesta Texas). oddball local choice, pure roller-coaster-dom, one *the* best designed coaster experiences America. Smooth, fluid, exciting despite 20 years old.

5. Guardians Galaxy: Mission - Breakout! (Disney California Adventure) Truthfully car parked.in sun probably disinfect quickly. indoors ac. people except say construction workers hide inside. think evenly spread out?

Half country lives like 30% Ontario still *overwhelmingly* old people get severe cases. seen drunken runs Taco Bell executed better US COVID response. care small number teachers could get sick children suffering? shut grocery stores hospitals, too? Tampa 100% ICU capacity. could say miracle people decided work together towards common, healthy goal all.

Not really, that's EU about. Yeah America (except Canada) Failed. Someone load last save file. Looking global stats, daily deaths seem level since May. I’m saying that’s good, interesting relative known cases, numbers deaths decreasing. would assume reading headline. Although right hot everything inside, fall winter it'll easier outdoor activities, dining, events. seeing foreign companies hesitant US contractors help alternatives possible. I’m saying shutter US economy think effect growing. Jesus made clear: go fucking die, phony Christians take seriously.

Considering even authorities many states counties take seriously, think schools will? need time money make work. school districts always begging funds. spend $200-300 school supplies start school year kids. get funding daily sanitizing, PPE (kids always own), barriers space kids.

I browsed article real quick caught childcare centers took number precautions, including disinfecting surfaces every hour, allowing children share supplies, organizing no-contact activities.

That happen public schooling. kids' lockers like 9 inches wide stacked next other. Lunch rooms band rooms always packed. Classrooms casually cleaned, students packed side side.

Discipline too. Public school teachers can't anything child fear lawsuit repercussions. Imagine kid acting spitting everyone. then? There's slight difference population density though. 200 years without ""Bumfuck, Nowhere"" us. Everyone pastors behind shit arrested, main guy one guys pushing too? confirm, close friend's sister nurse everything happened there, poorly mental health-wise. See removed numbers know article numbers dont match websites. However, Sweden still going less economically impacted countries.

The US CDC estimates IFR 0.26%. .26% within incredibly wide range.

Also, you’re going make claim like that, provide sources. deaths I’ve seen hands police drivers. need abrasive it, it’s bad look you. 100 million doses work definitely bring us close normal. Congrats! I’ll honest, idea Canada handle coronavirus know better job US lack testing removal liability? patients dying become infected? none above? ""We cannot play game statistics,” Infectious Disease Specialist Dr. Manuel Gordillo said. “We see young people getting extremely sick, young people ending ICU sick enough go hospital hospitalization could costly.” Last month Sarasota Memorial reported majority patients ages 25 45. Eleven patients even age 25. Doctors say trend continuing July.

Folks going keep making fun sub, real reason I’m terrified. I’m okay health 20s don’t wanna get dicked COVID, want friends family get sick. That's really works. small business startup asked advertise local paper, editor would jumped opportunity. specifically prejudiced selling ad mask maker, much even talk it. husband offered resign it, let it, even though writing popular column three years. important her. 

The advertising would helped out. masks sell $10 etsy make 20-30 per day. math. real job produces real income pay taxes on.

As mask quality, anybody makes 20-30 anything per day, eventually gets good it, ridiculous talking point. Silly worry drunk drivers, laws! still like lot Doug Ford's politics, shown hard times arrive he'll act best interest people's health. Democracy that's really ask, party wins regardless politics respect one another human beings.

That's far cry leaders US behaving like full blown sociopaths. Trump clearly one, know rest empowered political climate... death count hundreds thousands ""leaders"" simply give fuck. People dying dismiss nonchalantly inconvenience. disbelief (non-Trump) leaders would behave way, much population would find appropriate. actually based New York. Amazing got specific tests America can't  It’s amazing main stream media refuses discuss age group people ICU right now. talking relatives Florida want discuss fact death rate low increase cases healthy young people Better dump toxic waste Hudson light fire. ...oh wait Hudson already filled toxic waste, need match.

I think answer that, amateur, armchair thinking.

Thanks advance.  justaflu bro US purple stop arguing wearing masks, stop groupings hundreds people. socially smart. know, stop fucking spreading it. Lol ok. Positive flu test positive covid test. Totally.

And fucking right. Wrong. death labeled pnemonia people dying home ""heart attacks"". Asymptomatics also end symptoms severe sickness later. start feel better around 11 day mark takes deadly turn. Hmmm... organization denied, months, masks provide benefit reducing spread virus transmitted via respiratory/oral tract? one avoided declaring pandemic well met definition one? Maybe actually something sooner, position say accelerating. mental gymnastics trying reconcile Olympic-level. Must nice. used difficult get hired PA teacher, talk lack enough teachers near future.

People keen going education work 60-80 hours week school year (every good teacher tell case) pay average best.

Now throw pandemic interest sure drop. wear masks stay home much can. rocket science. mean concept germs theorized far back ancient Greece, mode transmission speculated via airborne pathogens got miasma theory. Germs thought spores Roman Emperor Varro even suggested existence microscopic organisms spread disease. Ancient Indian physician Sushruta also speculated transmission could occur physical contact. ideas expanded middle ages renaissance. teacher, confirm kids filthy vectors disease, killing grandma grandpa. Duh. university said students leave they're allowed cars first year campus. completely prevent anyone leaving campus sure. Sweden got pretty close problem doubled ICU bed capacity first month. reason get overwhelmed, peak April number covid patients would normal ICU capacity pre-pandemic. 90% ICU capacity nationwide scary days.  dieing

For second, thought said dieting, truly scared lol. April (of next year) spike might control. least something important. opinion protesting completely justifies midst pandemic. Fewer. Fewer!!! Mo money, mo problems... sounds like 2 paths! Italian grandparent, may shortest path.

Yesterday supermarket employee told woman ""please, put nose mask"", gentle firm way. everybody fine that. (I live Lombardy)  Brazil UK similar. India surpass them.  first job, process order bag Maam/Sir, understand airborne vs droplet transmission.

The question efficacy indoor vs outdoor spaces, question was, cloth masks effective? answer yes. since 100% people access surgical masks N95s, best encourage kind covering time being. Also, everyone coughing sneezing, sputtering public indoor spaces. already mentioned, protecting solely, protection people. Even stopping droplets macro micro, would argue makes difference.

The next reasonable step look using inside vs outside. I'm disagreeing point. think something better nothing. People complaining wearing masks period, hard stop. think would accept wearing N95? wear one every day, they're hot, everything condenses inside, comfortable breathe. think generally encouraging wearing masks sort help compliance road, again, something better absolutely nothing. 

We know indoor spaces recirculated air problematic setting airborne pathogen. information widely disseminated public. Apart people forced work, etc. willingly go sit inside restaurants etc need critical thinking own. Absolutely. cold hard equations, right?  

The ones invented, mean. UK worse prior last wek. one cares words like hear. seen bad people flipped started enforcing drunk driving laws late 60s 70s badly flipped seatbelts. 

It still bad tantrums people masks. folks substantial control issues. Thing ain't yet. Ol'Gammy better watch out. Vice President Mike Pence later announced CDC issuing five new documents next week contain guidelines schools parents ""tough"" existing ones.

""The proportion truly asymptomatic infections unclear appears relatively rare appear major driver transmission.""

They made assumptions back basically zero COVID-19 studies available review. They've reluctant change stance ever since. Please find study shows fomite transmission primary driver transmission. able to.

I also seriously question WHO's ability review studies. reported hydroxychloroquine study Surgisphere cancelled trials based it. study ridiculous amount red flags data obviously fraudulent anybody common sense.

I think following situation closely enough. blindly defend uninformed. 3 million cases, increasing 50k per day. Downvotes translation, good grief. best kind OP get downvoted. amount people social media enjoy whole thing social anxiety super high.

Not really mystery aren’t massive spikes infections protests, churches bars seeing cases. Maybe Texas sheriffs permanently stripped titles arrested public endangerment. many people turning virus political issue want listen government officials, science shown fact get someone killed think right. seems obesity overweight normal U.S. many people realize average American unhealthy weight many obese. think also people hear obesity disease, long feel mostly healthy, can't diseased obese. 

I also think way covid talked gives people false sense security. hear repeatedly people certain health conditions high risk severe disease get covid, sounds like number people high risk small minority people. obesity number one risk factor, 30-40% Americans risk. Polls don’t tell truth it’s sample all. like tossing coin 50 times. It’s won’t follow trend. 

Don’t get people love poll. Death toll irrelevant since countries count differently. 85% deaths nursing homes. outlier. Locking swedes working age would nothing. Also cause deaths since 00/01.

Please stay topic. Thank you. entire school systems shut days result normal flu seasons. makes sense shut longer pandemics wider spread, deadly, less treatable Oh don’t think  “active euthanasia” happened Sweden.

I’m disagreeing BTW. situation first. 

IMO questions solved money. concern fund relief? fuck said Isnt we're wearing masks? Half Florida cases ENTIRE pandemic last 2 weeks. 

it takes 4-5 weeks time infection death getting recorded published official records. There’s push get kids back schools. I’m parent, get it. Even pediatric society pushing it. every study says children aren’t big vector covid base conclusions testing data. Well, young people asymptomatic. course they’re going underrepresented days. kid isn’t symptomatic, they’re getting tested. lot places don’t even test young children begin with. Think it: little jimmy appears totally healthy you’re going swabbed hell it? No.

There’s lot signal disease causes inflammation issues asymptomatic people. So, start wide research it’s complete gamble novel pathogen.

Finally, teachers staff aren’t young! Like doctors nurses, entire economic plan rests treating people expendable covid meat grinder. send front!

It's possible would diagnosed correctly person, also possible been. trouble rare diagnosis, symptoms easily identified something else. wheezing shortness breath attributed reaction post-nasal drip sinus infection. 

I correctly diagnosed reached point clearly needing hospital, took heart losing 2/3 function sick. Even thought something like chest infection, able walk 10k steps taking kids trick treating. trying lose weight (but thought failing), fact I'd gained 25 pounds fluid largely around lungs mostly hidden weight loss. Yeah bc businesses physical location lose license compliant. Individuals much protestors walking groups thousands, sometimes shoulder shoulder, hours... many wearing PPE **absolutely** aren’t.. mhmm... Specifically wrong Feb/March? knowledge recommendations extremely consistent available data given time. thought still trying identify cells could fight off? However, getting sick depends much virus exposed to. walking street air flows past virus particles, probably going get sick immune system handle viruses.

On hand, indoors poorly ventilated place, viruses going hang likely breathe large quantity. Depends wich Timezone count mean social workers, police. point view, Doctors evil. first blindness, deafness obliteration. can't wait. Also demographic changed southern states. much younger group catching virus death toll specific group expected anywhere near high older group dominated northeast outbreak.

That means take even longer take time younger people infect older people. happens death rates rise sharply.

I think like 6-8 weeks outbreak start showing real death rates. don’t agree. infections Finland Finnish problem, it’s Finnish nationals. isn’t Finland asking Sweden close borders then? here's another doctor calling what's gone akin euthanasia:

Thats article says all. Duh church's fault get sick-- god's plan die (or survive need dialysis rest life). 

Also, Jesus preached mask-wearers trample personal rights. true follower expected argue people minor inconveniences prove point. Charles Darwin would proud. know you, recall weeks ago debating several people reopening soon. patted head told unrealistic expecting us remain lock down. yet, are, facing another nation wide lock attempt get back control. wonder much damage economy time around. sucks I’m child pastor, I’ve warning shit months. probably hasn’t hit church yet, wouldn’t know haven’t gone back all, seems like they’re testing God. 

You know whole story Lucifer tempts Jesus wilderness, way see basically churches testing God like Lucifer wanted, he’s going protect aren’t careful purposely subjecting covid risks. That's true, many deaths historical? know current risk level need know current number active infections. medical researchers public health officials don’t seem bothered fact smoking leading cause preventable death America? infection fatality rate 0.6% 5.6% depending age dangerous. doctor told 6% chance dying today (a full 94% chance surviving), would feel comfortable reassured? read 2000 year old book answers wearing mask today manage pandemic necessary, something wrong society. Hospitals close survey rooms. ordered close government. Covid way recoup lost income. 

Nothing I've said false. I'm amazed upset getting something common knowledge universally accepted

Got good laugh We’ve literally eased restrictions indoor dining, pubs indoor collective worship, ie virus thrives most. Let’s see September. suggest Lancet study. Also, I'm beginning understand sub known one big punchline. bias ridiculous every time I've seen positive news gets downplayed ridiculed.  Again, every accredited source weighed school closings said schools problem scheme things, especially grades 1-4. values money lives seem like joking matter you? 130k+ dead americans something approve lawmakers joking about? that, think. human brain stubborn thing trying maintain emotional equilibrium, optimizes attention emotions things nearest/most relevant moment. way feel random person died across world different way feel random person died front you, different still way feel beloved family member died right front you. 

The numbers, intellectually scary, grip viscerally given RELEVANCE personally. ""Oh? thousand people died? might looking another big spike?"" see this, understand implications fine, simply scare much would if, dunno, family member cared tested positive COVID. makes relevant. 

As human adults, lives nearly constantly busy one thing another. Work, food, companionship, children, personal needs, etc. harsh might say, difficult lot people actively care - simply enough mental/emotional power immediate needs care people can't see apparent relevance them. centralized HVAC probably safe. Strongly suspected published March number South East asian countries along China.

Maybe donate $2-$5 million stimulus money got education least next generation follow delusions. realize support local businesses ordering takeout? chaos pandemic result non existent pandemic? I’m saying it’s good chaos normal. I’m saying nothing pandemic like first paragraph article explicitly says. also think it’s good expresses concerns might put measures it. 

For you’re right borderline misinformation. opinion you’re getting article isn’t true. That's terrific, might want inform GOP leaders. Might good lesson schools reopen. lovely place called gods will. Churches open CA banned singing... That's folks. number pneumonia related deaths many times higher past years, chances high covid related. parents vacation outer banks week, next week daughter near town (10 minutes away) farm (crops only, manned laws) in-laws live parents allowed see COVID. super anti mask, can't imagine they're going beer runs every day grocery store runs like every year past. Shocking look states voted 2016

 

You cannot say unnecessarily politicized 1 side, seeing results this. can’t get tested ohio Covid pandemic worst it’s even discussion opening schools? Also bull crap kids less likely spread covid? makes 0 sense. government mess it’s really pathetic, let’s forget 19 million people still unemployed republicans don’t want extend enhanced unemployment. cares act expiring wich means evictions go roof people won’t money support families. what’s Congress do?

NPR good pieces eff Sweden? live? like parents can't opt out. 

Homeschooling keep kids home safe. Possibly. CoULd PrEdiCteD ThIS??? Plus wearing masks. That’s making huge difference Wouldn’t call constant confusion. would call naïve early confusion China’s initial reaction “NOBODY SICK NOTHING HAPPENING PLEASE IGNORE HOSPITALS RUSHING BIULD”

Once got SK, Japan Italy got good data. knew early 2 week asymptomatic transmissibility thing knew masks didn’t protect people wearing them. Heck even got whole genome sequenced late April  yeah wearing masks stupid sure 

but inside sharing recycled air driving new infections mostly really is. Mask compliance shown way behind every country including US.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* [COVID-19 survivors could suffer severe health effects talking about? would expect deaths start going imminently, unless since mutated less deadly form.

Also possible we've learned marginally better help lower death rates ICU, even surviving means long term effects. It’s even 50% though, it’s maximum £10 off. Weren’t studies yesterday tying increase spread indoor dining? Unless people wear filter face, can’t really help much. time virus circulated air system it’s already it’s second round possible infections. Yes. reading recently obesity is/becoming number 1 risk factor. way educate Americans national level... savage year 2020 talking here, floods recently Japan, Center China top ongoing pandemic.

I guess Mr. Earth done yet. pandemic definition superspreader discount week June 30, Arizona reported 55 new coronavirus cases per 100,000 people per day. That’s 34 percent second-worst state, Florida. It’s double Texas, another hard-hit state. It’s triple US also maintains highest rate positive tests state 25 percent — meaning quarter people tested coronavirus ultimately it. That’s five times recommended maximum 5 percent. high positive rate indicates Arizona doesn’t enough testing match big Covid-19 outbreak. Ron DaDingus Unfortunately, facts always work timelines required public health policy. entire premise outrage non-starter conversation. That’s try get messages via Onion South Park ... forget Q, places look real crumbs. Latino kids least affected Latin countries...compared what? Kids different ethnicities? Latino adults? two elementary aged boys, I'm fortunate school offering 100% virtual learning option coming year. minds, worst possible outcome us boys might repeat respective grades next year. that's unlikely outcome. return, boys stay safe make them, part decrease exposure risks teachers fellow students. think would irresponsible anyone option take advantage it. “Ok, ok, play cool, play cool. scientists saying we’ve ignoring it, can’t go hat hand. Alright, alright, we’ll say evidence ‘emerging’, yeah, sounds like we’re still things right.” Add pending mass homeless issue that’s less month away possible mass hunger stimulus checks stop coming. talking points going interesting sure. Completely disconnected reality. wasn’t Linde promised test begin with. foreign minister usually stuff. works *not* stupid population. 

I’m really starting lose temper. gone sort morbid curiosity watching slow motion trainwreck actively disgusting infuriating. 

I’m grateful live state governed morons, come enough enough. There’s joy getting say, “told so” considering enormous human cost. 

Wake fuck up, idiots. You’re literally killing yourselves. No.

And given Trump administration's apparent involvement process, assume vaccine comes process, US, going marginally effective, benchmark be: ""will convince sissies get back work, earning money us?""

Myself; plan trying go another country they're serious shit, like France, get vaccinated there. hasnt reopened worldwide locally, Zoom till next year LEAST! stores area armed security guards enforce it. Uh, local hospital admin recently posted Facebook hospital ICU wait list due Covid cases begged people wear masks. people started replying ""I called hospital receptionist said beds."" ""I know nurse works hospital they're saying health issues people put going."" nurses hospital joined thread calmly explain people may mistaken Covid th reason increase begging people wear masks adding many patients 40. turned giant shit show there. Yes, this. certainly appreciate sources however masks, much like every thing days, become something little common ground. people even think critically enough understand ""CO2 retention"" nonsense know source(s) would break them. 

This battle wills. That’s way works. fuckton money also help pay new jobs. total denial severity situation incredible. I'm sorry strong correlation IQ religious beliefs... wording.... he'd actually acknowledge statistic not. Hmm, correct. wanted see what's happening countries well. wear masks entire time
 take breaks. Concerns wearing maaks long real thing construction mining fields present joke. article includes original tweet. haha makes sense. I've never heard called confused OP downvoted aggressively. Makes sense might harder teach foreign languages video, guess lot passionate virtual language learners ""sort of"". ""it depends"". Full fucking stop, black, poor, chances getting poverty far less likely white person similar circumstances. Full. Stop. goes deeper heeding Jesus' words. Christians also whatever takes win souls Christ. Paul puts pretty well here:


1 Corinthians 9:19-23 NASB
For though free men, made slave all, may win more. [20] Jews became Jew, might win Jews; Law, Law though Law, might win Law; [21] without law, without law, though without law God law Christ, might win without law. [22] weak became weak, might win weak; become things men, may means save some. [23] things sake gospel, may become fellow partaker it.

It's basic concept Christianity lay aside rights others, like Christ humanity. Unfortunately Christians get labelled selfish goats described. agree, mostly. capacity makes total sense prioritize PCR right call.

The caveat Italian poster detailed use antibody testing contact tracing / infection spotting there, successfully too! complicated remember ins outs. 

But impression Sweden planning that, know sure. 

No matter, situation prioritize due lack resources, makes sense prioritize PCR hold back antibody tests. great man said, ""religion poisons everything."" vaccines currently development enough though? Yeah thanks. I'm inclined build wall tho said main cause. say factor. japan Friends Trump get handouts taxpayer money, corruption. Film @ 11.  People getting assaulted enforcing mask rules, retail workers put kind danger. think people reading book closely.

If wearing public health concern, least makes look like uncaring fool rest society. Stubborn Nowadays, start blame Chinese I’d imagine it’s easier stores employees enforce it’s law, even real reinforcement. It’s difference employee saying “my manager said so” vs “you’re breaking law” non compliant customer. related, sight apparently tip top shape. One best friends moved South Korea always gets called Chinese people even pisses off. He’s always nice would upset. really hate it’s never talked about. would assume Italian knows anything Italy? need censor them? dangerous. sub like thousand Members. even stupid, freedom speech.
It goddamn Internet. want take sub down? Hijack two thousand sane people downvote bullshit. Willfully ignorant people worst, religion breeds idiots millions Figured much. point I’m writing year entirely No, inundated US posts. courts unfortunately thrown people point mandates polio pre-vaccine, measles pre-vaccine, etc. etc. Spanish flu began appear San Francisco fall 1918. first documented case late September; mid-October, city 2,000 cases. city's Board Health enacted various measures try curb disease, banning gatherings, closing schools theaters, warning citizens avoid crowds. Professions served customers (including barbers, hotel rooming house employees, bank tellers, druggists, store clerks) required wear masks. October 25, city passed ordinance requiring everyone San Francisco wear mask public group two people, except mealtime.[1] Happy cake day! can't even name actual hockey player days 🤷🏽‍♂️ point natural selection running course. Fauci even try anymore? doesn’t emigrate country appreciate him? Man, much gets past guy it? went first time ages grab Hot &amp; Ready pizza Little Caesars, wore mask out.

However, time poor teenager (who mask wore properly!) behind counter tell EVERY SINGLE PERSON clearly displayed signage window: 2 customers time.

While less 6 people wearing masks, read signs, see little stickers ground said ""Stand keep distance"".

Every. Single. Adult. told read damned sign door. teenager. Dude 17 even. Nobody read sign, nobody saw almost nobody lobby except two extremely spaced people. Nobody even tried read sign - pandemic, there's kinds new rules policies everywhere!

What's sad none folks like anti-maskers, just... care trying aware. Like like day them.  Ehh think double effect seeing everyone things stopping say ""wait... thing real, one crazy"" ? also fact right , leadership answers thing new takes time make reasonable deductions data takes time get enough data even make deduction.

The politicizing everything helping slightest noise filtered out, think large reason people lost faith said 'eff it' bunch overpaid babies capital hill fighting turf war side thing: Humanity. already outbreaks daycares. Parents continue take sick kids school lie exposed virus airborne, airborne virus particles go right mask? *The Vatican entered chat* go get booze food Denver area wearing masks No, not. clearly talking antibody testing since said 'regardless symptoms' implies antibody tests. still needed symptoms time get PCR test. 

And moving goalposts. bad news promised delivered. Period. told lies facts ~~on matter~~, imo. history SARS/MERS type vaccine developments bleak I'd probably optimism you. actually even made person worse tested it. tip hat first person get vaccine cause takes serious Kansas numbers good are, ironically hurts efforts. None lives matter anyone friends family even then. think generations people giving one squirt piss going change soon, sorry good luck world. Jews lower casualty rates plague others groups. course, others took mean Jews plotting make everyone else sick poisoning water means, stayed healthier. Crazy much stuff Jews blamed throughout history. seen single infection neighboring cities 3 months. 

Bro takes one idiot went town 4th infect whole down. can't believe we're still arguments every day we're breaking records. thank you. thoughts inchoate laid down. posted yesterday/this morning I’m posting like site


http://covidactnow.org/us/az data SARS1 survivors correlate neurological problems SARS2. similar enough expect similar study, possibly severe neurological outcomes survivors. Thats fucked blows mind. wonder something King thought inspired historical event.  flat world people??  What, Mexico think better virus?, started massively testing numbers going explode soon. easy write discount people’s differing opinions saying “schools baby sitters parents fuck around day.” true, know it. Think little deeper issue. Working, day care, ability teach work time, etc. “When safe?”

(Gorbachev hangs Valery) Yeah shit  natural outcropping core practices. Evangelical churches interpret Bible literally. Thus, evolution true. Earth 7,000 years old. course physics lie touts universe that's 4 billion years old.

They're steeped tradition ignoring science expertise. experience they're also susceptible conspiracy theories since millions scientists constantly lying public -- must Illuminati! track record cultivating kind thing neglect shit conditions, *before* pandemic, yeah it. going find biblical justification Sabbath Sunday, regardless Paul decided meeting. mean upcoming global warming summers? it’s already summer fuck outside right now. starting point dumb think weed illegal. degree lot deaths are. People scared going hospital seeking treatment heart attacks / covid, would rather die company family isolated hospital *could* saved. Atleast case uncle. talking circles. 

My argument Fauci making hopeful guesses instead preparing possibilities waiting data become available, obviously opens possibility corporate interests. 

You counter argue anything, comment dislike claim emotional reactions Fauci 😅 

Have fantastic day best wishes you. Lol happened person running show claimed disappear like miracle. u make statement like bound create complete shit show. Geez. people seriously idea real hardship is. seriously understand you? There's big difference inside building one room together people know connections making feel comfortable getting close vs outside constantly moving around people know want stand talk hug shake hands with. Shut fuck up. People running around crying criminal dying caused way damage virus God fearing folks. REDDIT fucking gay, lmao. gun hand. disagree point ur head. seem remember lots people sub 

Those accounts largely deleted recycled. always influence operation. Malaria caused parasite virus. Looking vaccine waste time.  Atlanta sheriff... literally not. literally chaos returning pandemic subsiding, direct result pandemic subsiding. also possibility chaos could cause infection spread infected patients seeking care uninfected patients. honestly I'm realize could lambs slaughter staff.

and families kids. kids bring home families. mean cone shaped plague masks middle ages actually good form catch coughs? need dick someone’s beliefs. OP smart worship middle pandemic, want people do. ideology begin with. They're extreme right-wing whackjobs brainwashed think everything government attempt stomp rights liberties. According true detective, person arrest sheriff governor (in least one state). manager. reason antibody tests delayed want ""build robust organization around tests"". 

This sounds really good, well thought though. even know Antibodytests really worth, rush it, capacities developed. New York population 19.5 million. People seem forget state actually NYC. look statistics, per 1000 people upstate NY generally getting hit harder NYC was. dad zoom call governor state talking churches reopening. governor basically said start anyways needed get front least could try help safely. People insane man. Germany, thankful outcome far, things course weren‘t perfect. way little PPE hospitals. People still allowed travel Italy late February celebrate carnival causing major outbreaks predictable. course little tests available beginning first wave March. People waited one week get tested.
On hand people may complain masks still wear them. We’re obsessed rules... gotta make sweet Jesus green. Wow. Colorado closer Italy guess - we’ve masked since March gone grocery &lt;5 times. insane. Oh wow. heard this!

Thank sharing! even right? daily new case counts declining May June recall part narrative.  case noticed, situation taken significant turn worse past couple weeks guess consistently lagging indicator following case spikes region around globe..."
