0,2020-11-22," expression intended taken literally. Right. vaccine takes long time create still shit, like research create vaccine like science fair project, either. Interesting, taught opposite business school point bothers them. should. shitty humanity selfish. 

But point valid too. People really think get sick, get it, move on. media keeps pushing idea live die it, young live. pushing idea get permanent damage virus. ""people long term effects"" count. death count. people knew may potentially alter lives forever, they'd cautious, people don't. PerkinElmer lab California, fwiw. wouldn’t surprised problem happening number places, soon. Money. Fair guess.  people don’t purposeful intent getting others sick.

They intend wear masks pandemic around, not? don’t think anyone fault that. certainly won’t. get frustrated see bunch jerks right thing it’s simple do. desperate, auto section like Walmart find RV toilet paper. That’s awesome. I’ll getting flu shot target haha ever used standard viral diseases?

Can guess mean grammatically incorrect statement. asking science determined goldilocks region I'm talking about, determined infective mortality many viruses, 1918 flu, ebola, measles, small pox, etc. found virus like ebola, example, deadly seems stay within African region. Contrastingly, successful viruses actually ones non lethal like common cold. combining features infectivity mortality really makes virus deadly. know virus comes country yearly, poses biggest risk old young.

The good old ""but flu deadlier"" argument. Yes flu virus cause great concern. However determined covid contagious 2X deadlier flu. stop comparing things clearly understand. Coronavirus flu, completely different virus living.

Famous last words covid patients deny virus days die. That's according clinical colleagues. hell guy smoking. know restaurants massive vector transmission yet governor unsure that? fuck smoking? say drive gatherings indoors, disagree extent whole lot exposure see drive restaurants outdoor dining. People packed sidewalk - Los Angeles true areas obviously true trendier parts LA.

Statistically much likely exposed expose others exponentially larger group random people especially since idea kind safety precautions taking.

Also LOT outdoor dining gathering bars done people hosting people dinner homes - lifestyle thing.

Of course world filled idiots measures cut number exposures well theoretically give people second thoughts evaluating risks. step foot restaurant even open thought unsafe even outdoors many people assume safe open. Yep. Seeing lot state plates weekend socal.  One favorite spots Long Beach closed permanently. Little Vice 7th Redondo. would China need cooperate US beat COVID-19, already beaten it. It’s done patents too. Executive branch CYA No. find 17% restaurants close first year, 90%. 

About 5-10% restaurants fail year. Back 2014 got 5:00 got ride 'local' social services office apply food stamps. got around 5:30 already 40 people outside waiting. 

By time doors opened 8:00 120 people line. telling employee getting number got spend next 9 half hours sitting waiting room number called. job make excuse get work afraid I'd get yelled fired work day also get food stamp approval, people waiting jobs taking several leave without getting food stamp stuff down, probably went hungry least days longer.

It definitely Texas problem.  things??? Flying actually appears safe. Planes great filtration. issues everything plane air filtration flowing. Yup; *never* dude. Never everrrrrr, like people *never* interacted Black Death, polio, smallpox, SARS-1, Hong Kong Flu, Spanish Flu, two world wars, holocaust, AIDS, everything else. 

I really think sincerely appreciate word ""never"" means. stating now, human society goes extinct Earth explodes, worry COVID capacity limits stores, etc.? one shocked amount mink farms around world? Damn, sign up? get 3090 cash! thing cooking home...

Edit: Nvm, I'm idiot. see there. add one posters said, time start rationing care exhausted possible solutions. means healthcare workers going testing positive, double stacking ICU beds within single rooms, doctors taking far patients normally would, non-ICU staff moved ICU, pediatric health care professionals moved adult care, splitting ventilators, etc.

It worst possible type situation, seeing early New York beginning this. think projected numbers within 2-3 weeks hit capacity almost every state, another weeks nation wide rationing care lockdown instituted nation wide. point Federal government obviously really care, state something it. Hopefully state governor actually cares; mine clearly doesn't. republicans? Republican doctors? Guess can't see narrow view echo chamber. course, first, shiny new 1st place badge. Gvt start processing new car request immediately. second hearing 3025. leadership Texas fat pile stupid trash. bad they’re stupid find better people. remember something looks like might help, may still idiotic.

If outdoor dining responsible .01% infections, make sense shut down?

You need clamp order bang-for-the-buck. Governors orders caused that. Lots people got clue cook Oh boohoo. get fucking deserve. part moral degeneracy &amp; ignomy modern GOP. Umm, no, eat propaganda. actually look original data. Often calculations. Reviewed literature viruses, similar one, many function differently. terms transmissibility, incubation. There's lot look here, start analyzing examining specifics. since January 24. know means. used give plasma $20 college make extra cash. hours reading book listening podcast I'd get beer burrito money. place would 100 people waiting every race age. could get $40 usually around $20. might sound like much, difference eating night going hungry Welcome America. terrorist attack happened stadium killed 5 people injured 20 others, responsible would sent chair. 
 
If virus visits stadium virus kills 5 people cripples 20 others, cost business. 
 
Funny times live in, eh? fuck. Ted Cruz feels utmost importance Thanksgiving dinner family. actual fuck wrong country? Yes! Go get yours! always spread good word target!  Except 36 Dem ones, right? Nah, Reddit super community driven. get weighted feeds use /r/popular that's weighted feeds still based others enjoy, rather yourself.

Nothing like FB, Twitter Insta, shows thinks like see. I'm complaining pay schooling. even find college fund fact. I'm surprised even one grew food stamps trailer park 13.

I'm saying use entirety savings plus use credit cards fought disability. Homelessness even table, real possibility us college fund. main problem ICU beds full mortality rates everything car accidents covid heart attacks going skyrocket. 

That killed people NYC -- ran beds staff. scenario play Midwest state-by-state peak passes. government won’t pay people directly stay home won’t pay bars/restaurants directly close still cover rent, going continue happen Good thing doctor. wonder how'd feel doctor refused treat family member based political officiation. bet there'd hypocrisy there. Go America, guys keep getting massive numbers. I’ll stay watching safe distance Australia Anyone brain knows flying hasn’t safe. multiple cases news flights serious risk vector. Man, fuck you. skepticism new vaccine bad now? thought questioning things integral part scientific method? prime example it’s law policy doesn’t make right. mean “these people”? way? 5-10 % new restaurants survive 3 years? Whaaaat, thing?! one weird safe ish pandemic plans Thanksgiving? It’s gonna like 50 degrees rainy decorated garage plan outdoor, garage doors wide open, masked gathering hot cider crock pot pile blankets. It’s going family four, husband’s parents, 87 year old grandfather DNR forms prominently displayed home since turned 80. Sometimes get sick nothing attitude this. Welfare dirty word US. Stimulus check palatable politically. Italian, used stupid politicians don’t worry :) wonder military vaccinated yet? ask National Guard sent completely overwhelmed El Paso morgues wearing exact PPE $2/day slave labor. Mask, cap, shitty plastic apron, disposable boots, masks. prison uniforms / fatigues underneath, suspect wore back prison / wherever sleeping.

Bodies infectious. Lots people worked got bad April got infected; careful Township assistance terrible. next city over, friend ran township supervisor promise would take care poor people. 

She won, (previously snooty holier thou) staff quit protest. filled office caring supportive people, took seriously role transforming peoples' lives. advocate tax increase support does, people city approved it.

There's community garden there, yoga classes (at least pre-covid times), anytime plug someone services, do, smile. leadership looks like. helping hands do. Ugh, lazy writing last episodes ‘2020’. it’s getting absurd. 2021 guy here, remember 200k cases daily? MERICA!!! WOOOOOOOO! 

/s fuck corrections officers first responders way whatsoever, fuck mourning them?

They quit time want to. Every day life CO choice abuse someone vulnerable are. sympathy all. Wouldn’t nice able safely party add night club end summer? mean obviously I’ll hold reckless shit longer numbers aren’t significantly then… it’s fairly reasonable goal think. means lost job July 25, 2020.

That's extra $600 Pandemic Additional Compensation expired. Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Compensation allows get unemployment 13 weeks state normally allows Pandemic Unemployment Assistance lets otherwise ineligible types workers access unemployment expire late December.

Your argument may fine four months ago, missing point. hard find recent subway attacks. timeline vaccines arbitrary- research benchmarks need met determine effectiveness, accounts far *more one* vaccine hit marks appears promising &amp; effective. vaccine effective simply virtue taking long time make. Blue lives matter means ""keep killing blacks"". dont actually care law enforcement republicans wear masks? drug addicts treated OD? People speed treated causes accident? intolerant you? apply someone share political beliefs? think point opposite. making fun people. So? 

A 2-4 week lockdown might save 1000's human lives NJ. one talking 2-3 month lockdown again. believe lot countries holding long possibly medical officials 'review' numbers, race public perception, hospital capacity.

If people revolt begin ignore public health measures, approve vaccine quicker. hospital capacity, gets point places capacity, approve vaccine quicker. Home avocado toast actually pretty cheap - loaf bread, bag avocados, everything seasoning Trader Joes. got weeks worth brunch $10 Probably good take downtime proper recalibration. False negatives might lead infected taking precautions killing loved ones. Dis*gusting!* read Texas, don’t like state. Can’t read this, one push noted others. I’m sure connect one push COVID. Reddit midwits...they call evil this, he's right. people post ad nauseum bad income inequality is, get Murphy's case trying stop it. realize, shutdowns without financial support small businesses simply means small businesses go big corporations survive, right? Thus, continues consolidate wealth squeezing middle class lower class. reasons taking vaccine matter experts say.
We term that.. least two month. Texas want EMTs...? EMTs go away.... NJ’s hospitals good shape, aren’t wrong balance things.

But states either overwhelmed brink need act. That’d lovely. hope happens!! Again, estimate SUPER conservative. Thank Russian trial и я начинаю чувствовать себя невероятно странно! also know much treat NY hit. people believe made worse wearing mask aren’t going care leader says. Trump never said masks bad idea. Americans want..that American’s do.
And message super muddled officials people mask side...skip masks social distancing private. 5-10% restaurants fail year US normal times.

They exactly stable industry. maybe plan new surge january able blame brexit related problems covid.  Already failed business Seems like refusing answer questions, wonder why? kind lawyer takes case hammer state court could option 11, age, they’re still typically going parents say. taught 4th 5th graders. lot regurgitating parents say. years later starting think themselves. also rebelling more. 

Of course exceptions. personal experience teaching age 15 years. except actually emergency funding citizens access situations... go pharmacy (or pharmaceutical section Wal-Mart) buy water? 

No. buy grocery store like relatedly, vitamin tap delivering mega doses vitamin local nature preserve?

There's also fish market river nature preserve. excellent source vitamin diet though, many people make bullshit analogies bravado?

You tell us low p-value *does not* mean study design good--in fact, bad study designs severely distort resulting p-values! *If* study design entirely good, low p-value useful suggestion truth--or still misleading, chance. answer 2 weeks Thanksgiving. um, ok clear I'm pro vaccine generally, Polio perhaps best example comparing uptake vaccine yearly flu vaccine comparing apples oranges. 

The polio vaccine also rushed people terrified needed fix kids. turned vaccine produced Cutter labs accidentally contained live virus gave thousands kids polio, resulting dozens unnecessary deaths hundreds extra paralyzed kids. Cutter vaccine debacle benefit leading much effective regulation testing vaccines US government, that's good, taking away crazy anti-vax misinformation, history vaccines still perfect. 

And flu v. covid vaccine: true flu vaccine may change every year (or may - scientists predict flu strains likely prevalent given year means years getting vaccinated strains vaccinated prior years), incremental changes something generally well studied researched, completely new vaccine completely new disease. Maybe step back minute let go ""*everyone think think literally devil incarnate*"" mentality.
 
Just minute, go back virtuous hatred.
 
It propaganda may cause relatively healthy person consider facts make different decision might present circumstances.
 
We're talking highly transmissible virus relatively low mortality rate. Upper 90% survival rate. we're coming months seemingly wanton destruction people's lives livelihoods. some, cure worse illness. maybe not. maybe worry let everyone else same. article mostly talking Pentagon itself, building people work there. would speculate military personnel going considered one first tiers get vaccinated. like 2 million uniform another million civilians, services already pretty streamlined vaccination programs anyway. get like 90% people inside couple weeks. hell “Ohio first time reported 10,000 new COVID-19 cases day Monday.”  People turn protests loud hardcore few, I'm talking everyday people. lunch lady work, friends friends etc. seems many 911 conspiracy believers. personal take. go looking them. know live *in Minecraft*.

Visit homes *in Minecraft*. Take heads *in Minecraft*. threat talking Minecraft! disagree. overwhelming assumption everyone full display movie E.T. Extraterrestrial. Hazmat suits. Isolation tents. Decontamination showers. Airlocks. Pressurized biohazard rooms. Quarantine detention. Mobile labs. Government scientists. Police tape. Military checkpoints. Federal agents. Disease surveillance. whole nine yards. rolling immediately contain destroy contagion aggressively. got delayed intervals sporadically active negligence. Since get expected security theater, assumed actually threat. course CDC would taken now, right?!? Right?!??!!! Time gather indoors family friends alcohol PRIVATE homes. Thanksgiving still carries case UK far I'm aware across rest Europe. Damn Americans weird bunch - also get random drug tests professional lives right? weird. However justify rushing take first kind vaccine. logically impossible say 100% safe, therefore perfectly reasonable cautious regard.

My original point raising alarm dystopian character perfectly reasonable too. long standing tradition left leaning politics criticising systems power - irregardless heavily moralised context specific issue (see overly dramatic ""you completely willing kill others"" comment), proposal undeniably regards new system power weighed such. I'm perfectly fine taking vaccine, I'll take proven 100% safe. Restricting access society raise alarm much prospect fellow citizens dying. solidarity minimizes risky behavior, ya dick  Money issue, biggest issues isolation difficulty online classes imo. must nice live parents pay rent think easy. one going uproot life media psychosis 99.96% survival. Maybe rich snow birds might fly Florida. National lockdown bitches come entire pandemic, cruise lines canceling one-two months time. Biggest bar night year. anyway, stats proof, describe degree uncertainty something

I think reliable indicator describes sufficiently low level uncertainty, called ""proof"".  literally live rural America. people want reopen, many want vaccine. That's choice. COVID 0.7% fatality rate, 25% fatality rate. gonna disrupt food supply chains. Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* No, probably difficult. choose what's easier put risk. wouldn't, you. Take guilt shove ass. reason shit go away think vaccine weeks away actually working us, because

because propaganda effort piss poor.

""There's light end tunnel! months! miss one holiday season!""  city 5 million people - way bigger wee hick town single Piggly-Wiggly three opioid clinics. likely won't. Law Enforcement really enforcing mask mandates complaints I'm pretending all. option *choose* take not. like bit end guy riding around scooter box labelled ""urgent blood"" lipstick. surprise box ended holding stash pot, coke money. misread ""honestly, idea support just... stupid."" would explain huge uptick starting roughly 1 week post Halloween? Surely everyone didn’t start getting infected prison, universities, assisted living, etc. Halloween. simplest explanation Halloween parties indoor gatherings. events fall social gatherings. cutoff equals small vs large gathering probably debate. I’m trying say 6 people dinner together driving current wave, believing 500% increase infections starting 1 week first fall holiday correlation.

 study contact tracing PG county Maryland summer showed 66% infections acquired family friend social gatherings. New Years fun *I imagine lot people testing prior Thanksgiving, even though state essentially 4 week lockdown.*

Its better people least get tested go rather nothing. Good Minnesota giving people easy testing option! Ah they’re pussies death rate isn’t concern. don’t even right, btw, digress. also civic duty slow spread protect risk health care system staring barrel it’s inadequacy. 

In short, don’t fucking clue goal desires. American! already had, request, p-value percent chance results random, therefore tested hypothesis incorrect. 

There's nothing correct p-value 0.0001 means 0.01% chance results actually random, meaning 99.99% chance stated efficacy levels correct.

There's nothing correct that. Yes is. need preserve individualism. Covid lockdowns introduction communism. Elon musk stated twitter covid lockdowns fascist. Collectivism lead communism lead incredible tyranny modern technology. coronavirus never symptoms. people don't. situation exploited believe media propaganda. like Vietnam war. like Afghanistan war invasion Iraq. promise ones dying covid. Feel free save comment check back want confirm virus states around November 2019, University Southern California research already confirmed this. control Wuhan December/January mean YouTube can’t teach quick video music catchy graphics? world coming to! /s nude, wearing mask Tdap, Chicken Pox, MMR, polio, flu, host vaccines FDA approved children age 11 anti-vaxxers still risk kids lives.

This bigger Covid people actually know this. yet see school 1-12 mentions influenza actually new mutation every year. believe everyone led believe influenza virus never goes away(comes back every year)but strong enough threat society.

Edit: without pandemic dont even think would learned hard say saying shouldnt care people? people dont choice yes matters.  pretty obvious ur sociopathic ass trying say. even went say care either. study really needed right now

Really...

This America doomed  Triaging Trump really test limit power presidency. 

still become powerful. sure insane outliers (and USA big place fair share), crucial people middle sway either way want alienate tip balance. think time accept vaccine way going stop wave. People stopped caring virus. USA perfect cultural storm something like covid thrive. large population individualistic people love conspiracy, believe ridiculous shit, anti science. Thousands mini governments thing. culture tough guys rebel law face danger head on. never going end well us.

At end day, vaccine works lose around what, 500k? population 320 million, good luck convincing randos losing 1% population matters means canceling holidays eating overpriced shit restaurants another 6 months. social distancing Wild Turkey Wednesday. flagrantly ignoring fact.

And thousand times over, 2 vaccines ready go. one holiday season. one. Australia one densely populated nations planet earth. Noone lives rurally much country uninhabitable. sample size results? Wild Turkey Wednesday cancelled? Man, fuck 2020! don’t think negative consequences preventing large gatherings people? think peoples jobs economic activity comes from? Restaurants alone make 4% gdp. 

Do think children learn better classroom sitting home front computer? Schools large gatherings people confined space. 

We live magical world choices don’t consequences. believe it’s worth sacrifice that, sacrifice. thought irony pretty well explained top comment peaked interest. going about? *Even thee quarantine, still worth IMO. Even symbolic solidarity people*

Do avoid eating caviar ""symbolic solidarity"" people can't afford any? cars, drive beat 25 year old Honda solidarity poorest society? not, there's absolutely reason whatsoever gather Thanksgiving participants dutifully quarantined 14 days. Zero reasons. Nada. Zilch.

Repeat: **if quarantined 14 days, GO GREAT THANKSGIVING TOGETHER!** listen anyone tells otherwise. earned it. needed another study topic? Cue conservatives talking ""don't need unions government regulation anymore."" Like business miraculously grown conscience since radium girls. now, headline something dumb.  they're primary drivers? course.  think anywhere near enough concrete data declare that

This precisely article arguing. many posters quick judge title, saying bullshit. That's problem here.  There’s huge delay here. Today’s number included delayed count that’s cause relief. Apparently still 15,000 antigen tests verified. sounds like vaccine require two shots 3 weeks apart, another \~28 days achieve immunity. Plenty people gonna first shot acting like completely immune worry anymore. need shut enforce it.

It's simple. bad stay far in-laws. 6% red zone. Staten Island getting close. go pharmacy (or pharmaceutical section Wal-Mart) buy water? relatedly, vitamin tap delivering mega doses vitamin local nature preserve?

Seriously though, many people make bullshit analogies bravado? there's lockdown Germany news social media fuels distrust everything. Whether political process vaccines. think people see month 50 million people got vaccine nothing happened enough people fall line after. get seriously ill people took vaccine fine. Either way come April ain't wearing mask grocery store anymore. feel like read someone else's comment.

I speak POTUS powers.

I said Biden shutdown. Like Trump.  Tnx. :) thing know risk small. Especially considering covid vaccines right RNA vaccine something never used authorized before. Every news article 2 weeks:  

[NUMBER] family members tested positive Thanksgiving gathering. ""Don't make mistake us!"" Im talking like everyone wore face mask, face shield ban gaiters. people actually considered clothes possible source contamination. saying stay home Thanksgiving scientific.

What bloody hell talking about? 

People different households mingling drive infection. Yeah tough either way. want ""reward"" people brave enough stand guinea pigs, also want wreck trial. lose/lose. Physicians, nurses, health care workers dont choice.

a) always quit

b) vaccine....

So yes, choice. Multiple them. I'm really loss point trying get across. Right man, sounds like awesome thanksgiving. ""This [advanced Pretending people going uproot entire lives small risk small infection hilarious hilarious friend. article plainly states clear contributing spread. That's argued.

What clear touted fact whether major vector fall surge. Sure, problem. certain percentage population needs vaccinated get virus control. want info, look sterilizing vs non-sterilizing immunity. Yet, Herald-Sun's bleatings, Andrews government remains popular - far state opposition.

Don't give Murdoch much credit people tries brainwash little. feel sorry small business owners made significant cash outlays stock perishable foods Thanksgiving. warning them? state compensate them? might attract flyers lowers risk infection in-flight makes people comfortable flying again. Also, lowers risks employees. know break you, none outcomes going change pretend virus exist, actually get significantly worse rages unchecked society. also treat secondary infections antibiotics. 

We need stop comparing pandemic different virus 100 years ago existed antibiotics plumbing rural America. one earn prestigious title ""Top Civilian""? feel like top civilian.  Wonder TSA guilty superspreader events? United States enters chat.

Gives round applause.

Then walks dark corner.

And cries. Missouri?

I'm saying every case least appealed use American: ""Y'all fucked' soon pandemic became big news US, father, former healthcare worker, immediately started wearing mask brought several masks bought. Me, believing CDC, stupidly argued virus different blocked masks.

Sadly, many people dead, infected spread false CDC statements. hard wear mask yo. Literally sides protects us covid protects catching influenza common cold. They'll probably wanting mask soon... Please, share! That’s true. I’m sure nurse practitioner telling that. 

Is easy get? Hello no. depends severity mental illness, treatment methods used. 

In simple terms, someone schizophrenia repeated psychiatric admissions better case someone depression receives counseling social worker month. I’ve clients claimed major psychiatrist issues receive treatment, people primary care physician prescribe anti depressant actual mental health treatment. person could truly severe issues, record treatment non existent. problem every 1 person ""travels safely"", there's 100 people \*think\* they're traveling safely get someone sick.

3) effective vaccines covid don’t use virions all, kind. RNA codes virus’s signature infective spike. spike forms Corona around virus.

4) Flu epidemiology absolutely relevance

5) vaccines already proven 95% effective. wrong.

That's right now. We're middle pandemic, half people think end world get together Thanksgiving government oppressing they're asked wear mask. rest us get ride train vaccine fully available, get told overreacting. Done. Good luck! took every single precaution! matter? let Darwin take over. world, live it.   Ugh, selfish morons. Gonna dark, dark winter. Better let Gavin Newsom know  ""Brace yourselves, experiencing severe turbulence shortly hereafter!"" It’s almost human beings social creatures don’t want spend entire life devoid social interaction. outside masked gathering outside screen porch driveway garage multiple heaters fires 40 degrees. 

Everyone stayed masked eating eating stood least 10 feet anyone else. 

I feel safe enough. * sigh * yeah, us know already. whi going fly going listen cdc. Similar production timelines. Everyone started research time testing. actual design vaccine slow part. waiting trial results. taking vaccine mean going keep taking precautions? Lol- okay. Good luck, you’re going need it. Please see home state Wisconsin evidence.

I'll see Wisconsin, raise Florida. Way many state residents here, brought bad habits them. Dumb selfish ignorant Americans. Definitely going really tricky Thanksgiving holiday think see mostly Hospital testing much higher percentage positive difference me, read half article, read entire thing PLUS study itself. Yeah, non-woven blown-melt material good catching particles unlike cotton masks.   State Minnesota launched free mail-in saliva test kit two weeks ago, 150K ordered since then. demand high enough put daily limit. imagine lot people testing prior Thanksgiving, even though state essentially 4 week lockdown. don’t know accurate result would be; based 33 covid cases shit? Looks like Black Friday event Walmart. least reports anybody getting crushed death seriously injured process. 

People naturally going afraid locked together someone might infected since increase odds infected well. individual human instinct run away. That's pretty normal. 

But societal point view, temporary restricting movements 20,000 people test covid, allowing leave, seems responsible thing do. Right, hypocritical position complain income inequality shutting indoor dining, also complain failure government provide support. That's ideologically consistent. moved goalposts. argument people ""actively [be] running getting sick"" show profession adequate respect. activities ways keep people ending sick.

By way, one sick person created hundreds patients real life (not potential model scenarios), epidemic would months ago. real life, takes hundreds people spreading make one person sick enough become ""case."" Yes, less severe enough data really answer accurately crowd offset previous Trump morons wanted vaccine saying vaccines chips them? else come out? got certain number results bother calculating efficacy accuse something similar attempt side sort thing used beds available anywhere. another bed nearby hospital (or even one nearby) would redirect patient there. 

Hospitals communicate like time.

The biggest problem current virus surge happening everywhere once, going beds free anywhere part. Anyone know wasn’t even one secondary goals studies?  cannot understated MASSIVE news is. (and attenuated vaccines) ones administered huge majority global population thanks cheaper easier production easier storage/distribution. also proof research design portion pandemic response works works exceptionally well. literally change world. Sex workers get laid....off Okay, still makes OP’s article blatantly false. 

Also used 6 layers gauze. Question everyone i'm sure wondering 


Does 95 + 70 = 98 ? know true would considering cases received Pfizer vaccine (I think Pfizer, might Moderna) asymptomatic. 90% effective issued half dose followed later full dose booster. gotta think that's they're going deliver That's easy say runner duck People proactively getting tests Thanksgiving.

Nevermind fact wont get results time anymore Whitmer piece crap believe covid real maybe sign petition vote certain way. name list show breathing get vapor rub cough drops little cold live NYC dont car. dad would pick us train station honestly, sounds exhausting we're already tired.

Ill see months over. :( hard though unless chain AFH/ALF there's honestly fucking money pay employees PTO 90% time. retried/elderly citizens US fucked beyond measure. bad enough I've made silent vow need go near full time care home unless shit changes (M4A, etc...) never enough financial security pay ridiculous cost basic shit care via insurance gutted safety nets. would also believe disinfecting shared plates customers may effective one think, workers may sick still show work oh stimulus duh  40% selfless Americans know sacrifice means. rest (sane) world...Yoo Es Eh Yoo Es Eh....

/s mean? 30-39 year olds families worry about. going bars like college kids people 20's.

I interpreting split cohort; younger side cohort might still participating scene; older end might families, etc. I'm making broad assumptions here. believe first time read it. selfish colossal pointless waste health resources. going take flying knew sick care infect lot people. know way  Wow, return normalcy spring question? Though feel like plan US probably lag behind month two. Everyone expecting first 3 vaccines effective. wouldn’t get approved otherwise. least 2 candidates ended last months. happy virus actuality, last patient jerk. ""What's that?""

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Right - laws getting together, husband ones put foot down. Husband works factory sees 100+ people day, he’s going risk getting parents sick. know. know, may need regular SARS COV2 booster shots. simply idea right now. Back March knew less virus it’s spread airplanes. knew less course COVID. think decrease due lack information number cases, could wrong though. Jaime pull up... link sources magnesium? “Possibly” still reported COVID proven. can't work nature work

So can't bartenders, masseuses, physical therapists, plenty others. specific sex occupation stuck bad place life

This projecting morals onto sex workers though. leg stand going make sweeping generalizations. I'm vax denier anything lingering question that... vaccine announcements seem calculated? numbers coming one sparks high stock prices optimistic news making hesitant take seriously. I'm sure numbers correct way news treating seems calculated me. 100,000 lbs equipment

resistance training never equipment. need think box, like many already done, cancelled bankrupt gym memberships. dont u need 80% herd immunity? 60 70% seems exactly would expect. There's always 30 40% Americans answer poles like batshit insane. like matter consensus world comes least 30% people America want completely opposite. 

That said think 40% may answer polls disdain answering polls actually real life, especially due politicized nature virus fact unnecessarily controversial election.

So might 40% first 30% first month two maybe even 20%. kind doubt goes 20% considering issue falls realm anti-science Trump fanboys. 

I think matter vaccine supplies ability distribute fast enough staggered distribution course couple months.

The people willing take first protected first simply higher risk choosing wait next batch.

There's kind plenty time percentage go people get little comfortable idea...but time expect keep high vaccination people course multiple years probably smoking hope rock hard.

I expect eradicate virus current vaccines. knock level like serious/mild flu 20 30% people never going regularly take almost matter what.

The flu vaccine gets 45% adults simply feel like getting shot somehow fear it. Ideally get vaccine high average immunization rate people want get mostly bring friends family, maybe eventually learning better process.

It really depends persistent lethal virus 60% people get vaccine quickly get 70 80% people vaccinated. think much convincing them. They'll mostly experience least outbreak area close enough effectively see backyard.

At end day Republicans mostly killing Republicans guess that's freedom means them. much people self-destructive kind short timeline. place went ever since city tax revenues paid rural infrastructure Adults thriving right therapy feel lot comfortable eye eye contact. hope stay safe work many older guardians kids losing parents removed home want keep safe possible. I’m glad office mandating us home keep us safe also clients vaccines announced far, 90% effective, 10% people less severe symptoms?
If so, much less? 
Has data released showing this? Title opportunity missed: Sex Workers Laid Unless you’re French Laundry health officials. it’s acceptable. 

And subs case downvoted reason me. I'm young healthy getting mild moderate illness suck I'll likely fine. terrifies potential long term effects serious illness. I'll roll dice 70-90% effectiveness immunity almost 100% chance worse symptoms. Hell, that's better usually get flu vaccine. quality control there?! thanks.

I think would wise avoid knock-off COVID vaccine offered random Alibaba seller. many reputable international companies manufacture products China high quality standards. would immediately assume quality compromised.  massive dose tho

it feels like 4000 day pointless need getting equipment handle good vaccine. can’t 30 percent populations risk dying get inferior vaccine. trial behind many candidates' trials, seem double dose Kenny assuredly trying all. yeah, industry group want go unbiased opinion. milk body good according dairy council. Yup, that’s biggest risk community work keeping client safe ""Come fly coughy skies"" It’s “unethical” every potential treatment? No. Going route would quickly bankrupt company, wouldn’t new treatments. exception urgency situation.

You somewhat valid points public pronouncements, it’s difference I’ve seen Moderna Pfizer/BioNTech approaches.

Moderna’s CEO bit salesman. Nothing wrong that; company needs that. public statements closer describe: casting positive light possible results early possible. Fortunately underlying results are, fact, quite good.

Pfizer/BioNTech taken opposite approach though - public statements lower range could get away with. initial announcement said vaccine “at least 90%” effective, turns meant 90% bottom statistical range uncertainty. Actual efficacy identical Moderna’s, announced 95%.

Oxford/AstraZeneca appear gone closer Pfizer/BioNTech route regard: one dosing option appears give 90% efficacy options lower “headline” number they’re touting far 70% - they’re rather conservative. bad ""speed"" prevent Wuhan infecting entire world. Go cruise ship facebook pages. tons people-- pages upon pages-- complaining trips cancelled March, rescheduled re-cancelled July, waiting first ship available book vacation. They. Literally. Don't. Care. read stories people trapped board 6+ weeks, phase them. guess stories people suffocating death hospital beds enough get point across, nothing be.

Let's use trend actually benefit society. Let's put call anyone wants cruise right now, mask free. Let's put em boat sink middle ocean. That's one way collectively raise IQ fraction point one day. Nevada article written? Sure, long reporting income properly everything board. Poor little one. know younger children tend better covid outcomes generally infections flying around, likely children put positions like *don’t* good outcomes. That’s even outside stuff like chronic conditions arise viral infections, complications high fevers low oxygen... Clinging desire catastrophe... Getting effective RNA vaccines huge step forward. Research start focusing create temperature stable delivery systems. good future. No, really not, felt rushed correct dangerous myth, express clearly words people understand. bad, sorry.


The *null hyposthesis* ""the treatment effect"".

A p-value number Assuming study everything right, assuming null hypothesis (that is, assuming *the treatment actually work*), result good likely p-value says.


What person replying said wrong. may paraphrase them, said p-value Assuming treatment useless, there's much chance works.

That's contradiction.


Please read link gave previous reply, time energy to, let know makes sense. necessarily say exactly I'm saying, make another extremely important point: p-value good study protocol--*it reflect errors researchers made designing carrying study*.

In link, there's great example: flip fair coin four times get four heads row, that's p-value 0.125, 12.5%. mean there's 12.5% chance coin fair, beacuse we're assuming is! result that's 12.5% likely coin fair, *if* flipping correctly--and medical studies *a lot* harder right flipping coin.

(EDIT: wait, p-value four heads three? idk, need coffee lmfao. hope got point across! know garbrandt read comments. Really tired ""we've known since X"" keep seeing sub regarding every single study, every topic. No, haven't. We've suspected. still know anything sure. data, better. 70% protection? way earth taking lol Wait, what??? Vet med different practice level. obvious physical difference patients. pathophysiology cats, dogs, others quite different. Oh no, get it. 

...sorry repeating obvious joke? Another Aussie indoctrinated nanny state government completely overlooking pain lot fellow citizens went through. combine vaccines one we'll 355% effective regards hospitalizations, [all give data released CDC regular take nit-picking inclined.
 
As second statement, we'll disagree. People make decisions themselves. Unless position elected appointed leadership that's do.
 
Certainly, outcome another person's decision affect you, also depends upon decisions.
 
Living defined independently individual prescribe exactly entails. Different people different tolerances risk assessment risk aversion - none identical.
 
Finally, comment: hard sit still bit let shit pass?
 
That's right question begin seeking predetermined (by you) answer.
 
I'm sure mother father ever told world, get define people ""need"". faster learn that, sooner over. Never, obviously. Regardless, anon posted argument paper sounds valid (even though I'm extremely skeptical zero respect 4chan), friend considers person credible, thought I'd seek second opinion. could give Oxford vaccine glorified chimp flu virus like zero risk. Exactly.  source stats? never seen stat before. much decline positivity rate going well. 

So again...huh? least corrupt Eastern Europe, Greece is. Herschel great character. I'm convinced made cotton candy. Remindme! 3 years Kidney stone epidemic incoming... Plus bet lot places eventually require children get vaccinated go public school—at least expect live. Ya huge risk, guy basically geared started producing vaccine even confirmed safe effective. Can't stand agree stances...right... Eight weeks lock supplies needed get versus shit show United States? 

If choose two would you? might. I’ll mask sniffles, anything I’ll top getting flu shot every year (just got yesterday). Oh take year travels plans. feel sorry anyone unfortunate enough come contact get infected. Sure, still wearing masks window. actually true, open 10 days May closed right that. scale 1 - 10, fucked nation? fucked Los Angeles? worked months. industry opened up, safe. crazy use savings take couple months off? I'd personally want wait negative test kid. wait fourteen days test Im sorry isn’t vaccine going free readily available U.S. like um everywhere? mean tension Twitter, etc inflates. Many convinced America terrible place cops lining pick civies daily basis. They're free believe whatever want - make true - sound quite dramatic.

Protests justifiable means part group event outdoors year. saw many protest stages bands performing. Drumming, etc.

I stand observation many went protest outside socialize make methods available year. got 2 words people: long haulers. 

Even besides death hospitalization, post viral syndrome looks like really sucks experience...the residual symptoms staying significant number people hospitalized seem debilitating really awful. Hey, congrats mate, hope August works out! *with proper precautions Alright cheap hell. inevitable result society built around greed competition instead co-operation empathy. Workers never anything expendable unless revolt.   Yeah 70% anywhere near good enough test dummy this. end January 30% immunity due vaccinations acquired. add 10% month thereafter. It’s light switch, R value go past worst April May. important catch asymptomatic since US noted around 40% positive cases arise asymptomatic spreaders [easy answer, even denialists afflicted room temperature I'm arguing saying, say I'm gonna masking flu season on. I've flu horrible. imagine people masking future, Asia. someone coughed face COVID positive, soon could take test positive? (Swab test, UK)

Long story - much drama re-live here. Well thats lie  Tysm sharing experience thank thr encouragement! 
I expect easy hopefully disappointed. daunting moving new country gotta gotta. information rural vs urban mindset comes people responding Covid. family NYC family rural attitudes toward Covid different, I’m trouble articulating that’s case even though makes sense me. Gotta government useless get those. bigger problem LA indoor social gatherings, outdoor dining reason cases 4K daily. honestly can't believe light end tunnell. felt like would never come even month ago. Ardern said Biden wanted pursue discussion New Zealand's response further. cautioned nation's model may able replicated everywhere. “While New Zealand number natural advantages assisted us managing virus, absolutely believe international cooperation continues key getting virus control,"" Ardern said. ""We happy work country share knowledge data helpful.”

Didn’t read you?

Also, NZ 5 million people 25 deaths. Might nice talk find she’s done, cause take place US 5 million people there’s lot 25 deaths. 3 small kids exposed officer wasn't. I'm confused Yeah winter going suck. like holidays? I’m decorating first time 10 years. think it’s helping iust alittle. try make sit porch least half hour every day suns nice. Interesting &amp; thank you! shut New Zealand.

We need shut down.

Biden's plan seems Trump's plan. comment possible ideas. One reason might immune cells body competition antigen. limiting dose, strongest responding cells survive form memory. giving much antigen, weak responders survive strongest responding cells even die off, resulting poor response later. 

This competition seen process somatic hyper mutation B cells. response antigen, B cells proliferate begin randomly mutating B cell receptor (which later becomes antibodies). B cells compete available antigen, mutants strongest binding surviving produce antibodies. high dose lead antibodies weaker affinity antigen Yeah guess rounded 51% 6/10.

Or 53% count everyone voted third party/ independent spoiled votes. fellow Floridian, plenty in-state residents bad habits well.  Iirc Oxford private institution. I’m hearing well. People 100% pro vaccinations skeptical one. someone covid, reason get vaccine? intention hurt *small* businesses. massive anti-small business sentiment within local, state federal government country gives opportunity they’ve wanting along. efficacy percentage give mean works 70% patients? stop virus/symptoms 100%, greatly reduces (by 70%)? care /r/HailCorporate, miss going Home Goods think got Placebo Vaccine? linked sticky thread atop covid 22 subreddit. 

I wish could say certainty joking. Immediately eventually? Cause I'm first half I'm absolutely getting vaccine feel proven safe agree lol. I'm saying protestor demographic demographic that's filling hospitals. going get extremely bad year over. Bars clubs going absolutely packed over. Roaring 20s 2: Electric Bugalo come! that's spreading virus tune 4k cases daily. would like think would work plenty nurses record stating covid patients still denying it’s existence. 51% 47% win Biden popular vote. Great title song. cautioned findings prove causality

This important. Vitamin often linked sorts health conditions, it’s pretty good proxy persons overall health. 

They proven vitamin factor body responds covid. There’s certainly harm taking inexpensive supplement, it’s sensationalized headline. know youre alone. Lean havily coworkers. seriously burned ptsd. work things crazy, coding people nightly leave work see people walking around without masks blood pressure spikes internally rage. stupidity america gnawing inside. Im going fucking lose it. 50% study participants healthcare essential workers. still studio audience point 4chan become leading authority vaccines? I'm Canada tracer app, even rolled province yet even know anyone else that's actually installed it. agree. trying make light situation, availability hospital ER beds. trying make sense article particular case (my first thouht was: little girl going OK?) totally agree larger issue failure government put restrictions stop spread, addition people stupidly irresponsible, uninformed, ultimately childishly selfish - created additional crisis people sick things cannot get medical care. specifically remember first post saw like vaccines announced. People commenting, ""Absolutely not. moment get vaccine, masks going trash."" barely month people already warming idea new goalposts.

Fucking ridiculous. People need aware they're manipulated. believe would really vaccination rate get economy opened back quickest. said two weeks ago RemindMe! 3 years

Replying say hello future self. pandemic sucked ass! It’s hard take politicians seriously won’t even follow rules. Trump blame that, mention EVERY govt executive filled appointments history suing trying dismantle govt office hold. Thanks advice!   Username checks out. think sub somehow convinced folks risk/reward ratio equivalent *hide basement 2023* somehow ""not giving fuck"".
 
In reality, degree people take precautions preparedness behavior dynamic change time. Risk assessment aversion two areas humans largely suck - better worse. accurate analogy OP saying Bugatti faster Lambo, coming saying Bugatti faster black, response Yellow Bugatti still faster Lambo.  I'll probably wear mask indoors get jab yea, high risk, elderly, essential workers done, time start opening gradually. course helps physically fit, it’s fucking immunity, acting like offensive people passed away healthy.

Also, ton people overweight, cannot lose weight physical ailments, disabilities. OMG. None idiots wearing mask they're packed like farm animals. Good lord.  “sterilizing” immunity? I’m sure that’s thing heathcare workers, would zero issue. First responders work whole time always left equation. hate ~this~ country, something fundamentally give here. Ok, get then. Risk covid. That's choice smart one eradicatingcovid risky though - causes new mutation occur like MERS? take couple years globally. saying conspiracy going on? one side official strategy hidden strategy lead Tegnell? Löfven, Hallgren Carlsson also conspiracy think acts alone? see lot people saying ""I wanna see [insert name powerful political figure] take first"" like...even Fauci/Biden/Harris/Hillary/Obama/John Cena released video getting vaccinated, people would turn around say ""they're getting injected saline!!!11!1!"" better vaccine actually better can't easily deployed. vaccine good enough manufactured easier deployed easier developing countries. know going long long journey back reading last words ""return world without restrictions"" gave much hope. 5-10%&lt;100%. Thanks that.

If outcome vaccine works 70% people, i.e. contract it, 30% significantly reduced chance seriously ill virus would say that's good result.

What struggle numbers involved draw conclusions, take point methods test difference chance reasonable certainty. think I'll reading methods reliable are. We're nowhere near peak US. Thanksgiving ramping cause disaster Christmas follow suit. rolling vaccine US begin mid December first. people protected we're well January. (The vaccine two shots four (Moderna) three (Pfizer) weeks between.) that's result expect dosing. Full + full give protection half + full. 

Not necessarily.

The Oxford/AZ vaccine uses viral vector deliver payload. possible start full dose, body produces robust immune response viral vector SARS-CoV-2 proteins produced viral vector infects cells, could cause second dose neutralized quickly able work produce SARS-CoV-2 proteins. incredible. remember feeling pessimistic month two ago. They're talking daily death tolls. assume laws saying ""It's illegal outlaw crossing state border changing law take minimum 4 years take effect""? helps. nothing wrong cautious. unless anyone autoimmune issues y'all getting vaccine comment political relevance pandemic.

Corruption country affects efficacy care. 90% effective specific dosage (half dose first time, full dose month later). truly INCREDIBLE news third world countries. happy. Thats BS. People read checking thumbs up. Gov States way heads. start pushing freeloaders corse hard working start getting shaft. tha fuk think money comes from? People great helping people take chances away attacking orgs form simply beliefs. Dumping EVERYTHING Gov stupid childish. ends striping hard working ONLY.  time nationwide activation military start setting field hospitals. National Guard regular army necessary. need start creating spaces inevitable patients. immune compromised people likely attract covid probably. prevalence genpop definitely wasnt 11% think saying 3.5k *per day*. know lot family said early on, dad vehement supporter belief vaccine would take 10 years basically altruism way virus. it’s rare I’ve able say this...

*BUT F—-ING TOLD SO* dark hole sub obvious detriment USA pandemic response. must named, can't deny must named giant part current predicament. Even Norcal we're getting point weekly deaths start comparing wiping local small towns. 

This week's deaths would like half Dixon's population died. 

This week's average confirmed cases would like population Davis Fairfield infected single day. know Greek guy worked hospital city along coastline. told corruption. director hospital son without medical expertise, given position management. guy rarely showed work.

It seems fakelaki system collapsing pressure pandemic. incompetence corrupt leadership symptoms problem. really fishy since target part virus. Lmao China socialist way. workers means production? No? it’s socialism.  theory problem, A) message Thanksgiving clear then, B) people would already removed population. people care. Even so-called progressive pro-science areas, need government prevent selfish motherfuckers hurting community. think vaccine starting roll greater vigilance make pretty close peak. Soon tens thousands getting vaccinated daily. hundreds thousands. It’s always darkest dawn. say that's uncivil? 

Saying people take risk, suffer consequence risk, that's unfortunate, totally understandable fact life. choose drive car, get accident unfortunate, try reduce risk, end, die, die. like Inspector Clouseau (Pink Panther) movie, Hudsucker Proxy. Hiring worst guy possible job.

Unfortunately, think, like movies, turn successful it. calculation, I'd say low side. want factor locked R rate, rather happens remove restrictions. Otherwise, going full-on NZ/Australia-style elimination strategy keeping R number 0.5-0.75 range.

1.3 seems get R rate without legal restrictions, relying closing large-scale events like concerts, etc., goodwill (but means all) population. 90% group quite small. Might fluke. second week December telling. article details one studies:

**'Oxford' COVID-19 vaccine found safe clinical likely countries giving free vaccine, yes, necessarily let pick vaccine would like. mRNA vaccines hard logistics deep freeze required, much expensive, know fast different options produced, quite likely places free program Oxford vaccine.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* hope sir. Bbc reporting weighted average, sky news 90%. saw NHS plan aims inoculation everyone 65/at risk Jan initial doses start Dec.

If everything stays track NHS aims UK vaccinated March. 

Tremendous timeline achieve it. correlates MCRs reunion tour rescheduled
for late summer. surely vax developers fellow emo kids mean white house run people either senile, end life end this. gonna thinking long term? dead five years anyways. No, spoil someone's re-election, course.  John Glenn hospital divert, even ones area do. find space, imagine COVID fatigue within public we'll get hit even harder. 

I wonder time. Granny Dump Day divert. COVID? Maybe. working well, feels like normal summer guaranteed. normal spring realistically possible well. denial, could positive way looking things. Lol, case, good day :) wait marriage first it’s safe Jerry Jones deserves season. fans not.  implied Indians aren’t Asians 9 goodnight :)  What, people even feel it? estimates 10% world population already got October. That's almost 800Mn people, probably lot now. 1.4Mn people died. That's less 0.2% mortality, high estimate. 90 year olds kidney disease getting classified covid victims. attitude. 1 350 Americans CONFIRMED positive week. 

Even testing there's still estimates double triple true numbers infected right now.

If ever year push Thanksgiving spring time, it. Bringing Lamb slaughter. coronavirus vaccine developed University Oxford UK stops 70% people developing symptoms vaccines companies Pfizer Moderna showed 95% Oxford jab developed company AstraZeneca lot cheaper easier store, meaning transported Oxford researchers performed large scale trial, 20,000 volunteers, half UK, rest Brazil taken medicine test safe effective found effectiveness jab rose 90% group volunteers given half dose first, followed full dose. clear difference stage.**  Anyway, good discussion. wish good night :) That's mask mandates probably stick around bit till known. (vocal) majority convinced vaccines safety lot disrupt mass immunization.

They actually good points, pandemic needs end already. distribution look soon? countries first get it? I'm assuming UK. many US Canada get? rest Europe? Yes?

The mask magical barrier prevents 100% things getting you.

Similarly, 6ft magical distance stay 6 feet everyone can't catch virus. yeah don’t represent major part population Oxford University said interim analysis phase 3 vaccine trial showed efficacy vaccine 70%. came combining results two different dosing regimes, one 90% 62%. 90% regime involved half-dose first full dose vaccine later.

This interesting. I'm sure mechanism much lower efficacy full dose-full dose -regime would be, least part could random. Even massive sample overall, 131 cases two dosing regimes control group, cases control group, handful cases per dosing regime. single case would swing efficiency estimate multiple percentage points. 5 cases imported overseas today.

As Saturday, 21 cases remain hospital 1 placed intensive care unit. total 28 people passed away due COVID-19. total 58,064 patients fully recovered.

As Last Monday, 4,227,877 swab tests conducted. 741,700 swab tests per 1,000,000 total population performed.

The air travel bubble Hongkong suspended 2 weeks due new outbreak virus Hongkong. nurse like this. told patients second floor would love hear her. 4m doses ready go UK, 96m still come. mention it’s quite bit cheaper. wonder might see (presuming truly less effective) distributed majority population (say &lt;60’s) older age groups getting mRNA vaccine “In entire world, China ability get zero. countries don’t ability,” Zeng Guang, chief epidemiologist Chinese Center Disease Control Prevention, said webinar hosted Chinese media September. “It’s getting zero, even control first wave epidemic hard.”

&amp;#x200B;

“‘Clearing zero’ actually economically effective way epidemic prevention. don’t that, problem get troublesome,” said. “Use heavier hand, get zero, people feel reassured.” literally article yesterday someone know (they got negative test result) gave four people plane. like lot excess deaths year. given option I'll taking one. know sounds little odd I'm little scared mRNA since new.

That said, I'm open whichever one get. Hmmm, year now, incorporate vaccine flu shot? flu shot made response Spanish flu. it’s cure actually small dosage Spanish flu body develop stronger resistance it. It’s kinda like buying insurance. 50,000+ participant Phase III trials publish peer reviewed results NEJM, Lancet, Jama etc. plenty documentation start - trial protocols instance public. mentioned elsewhere, anti-vaxxers simply can't convinced stage, indirectly shamed coerced (1) seeing peers taking (2) restricted things like concerts / events result taking vaccine. no. Two different ""ways"" giving vaccine tested. One ways give 90% efficacy one 64 thus average 70  NJ. We're seeing uptick cases NONE us looking forward Part 2. 

I already see nurses eyes. Especially ICUs. One kindest, optimistic, upbeat nurses would ever meet started look. 

And God make sad. think worth factoring whatever percentage population infected recently enough immunity event, trying model progression case numbers. could high 30% time non-risk groups vaccinated.

Secondly, worth mentioning R(t) = 1 (allowing population immunity measures) means cap case loads; mean start going (although percentage points population starts happening appreciably). *could* either rapid spread, social distancing, combination two months even vaccine program finished, that'd normal healthy. 

That course depend extent success protective measures program though. Interesting see situation develops. opinion, majority people convinced vaccines safety yet, also group refuses vaccinate. Based. Fair enough Except Musk nukes, way making them, would anyone allow nutjob like weapons mass destruction. So, invest money yet ;) Would physician ever suggest patient takes RNA non-RNA vaccine, increase chances developing immunity? know, old *""two condoms must better one""* approach? Seems like vaccine poorer countries. shorthand wrong factor 100.

3.5k 3500. 5k 5000.

We're 260,000, 350,000 would 350k. possibly said reasonable certainty vaccine prevents serious illness 30 people contracted virus given jab?

It's extremely likely 30 exposed virus, 30 fell ill. look numbers placebo group, 101 fell ill. ""only 30"" wrong way look it. Imagine perfect vaccine prevents infection 100% cases. results would say ""0 people vaccinated group contracted virus"". always look numbers, 30 101. Since 101 much 30, results looking good. good mRNA results difference even larger, still good.

Obviously scientists look numbers say ""well, gut tells difference numbers big enough, let's approve this"". methods ""test"" difference give chances random difference got lucky trials. case, say very, very, very, extremely likely difference really vaccine works 70% get (and reduced chance severe covid 30%, I'm sure statistically significant finding right now). Two weeks later: health care system collapsing. Somebody something! did. said meant like sigh relief. another example text conveying tone message. ""Hey, Gary. Sorry interrupt daughter's birthday party, we're actually going need come Saturday help stack corpses freezers. What's that? Precautions? Uh, bring trash bags PPE want. See Monday."" - management take don’t lawyer yet. take serious get lawyer. Time get lawyer , specifically lawyer specializes worker’s compensation. 

What doctor saying issue? Google doctor name make shire IME (insurance medical examiner) list doctors.  Broken childhood, military, trouble forming maintaining relationships adult little interest around family have.

Actually time military period lot people around holidays, we're scattered now. General Sherman Hilarious 'trust science' crowd suddenly decides 'acktully I'll wait', usually based anecdotes superstition. better hurry pump vaccines. done following guidelines. theres garbage filled shit smeared paper? Probably January, maybe late December lucky bet it. Fuck feelings. Got deserved. 

It’s people like reason people like care got sick despite giving everything outside house sympathy, fucking idiots read studies skim article? They're claiming conclusive evidence exercising dangerous anyone contracted COVID.

They find potentially serious issues majority COVID-affected individuals concluded study needed determine research means.

Calling article bullshit based handful anecdotal data unwise. quote great Mark Twain:

*Never argue stupid people, drag level beat experience.*

If ask nicely take seriously. quote facts, they'll say ""fake news"". stand ground all, they'll call asshole.

Some people can't reasoned **period**. Unfortunately grandma, people need see dead body change mind. paywall, go ft. slaughterdale BEFORE???? live IN. work morons every day. far know dodged far.  Looks like mRNA way go *All farmed mink in Denmark culled* 

That posted article. surprised journalist really check actual status Denmark.

So culling continuing even order deemed illegal? It’s me... 🤷‍♂️ see common US, employers even want require masks state/local mandates required it. see even less popular. quit never signed shit. 

That pretty much sums *the Utah community*. gave virus May.

Thankfully, medical professionals carry on. there's nothing Biden curb rate infection. got governors pledging implement restrictions dumbasses like people follow anyway.

Fuck it, lets keep bars open, let 'em rot.  merely pointing something you......didn’t. ye, kinda. life, specifically medicine doesnt work way. constant down... phase immense success always come big dissapointments. expect someone getting approved efficiancy numbers drop 50s range followed vaccinated people dying news making big deal it... still probably seen dinner parties.

Eventually, yes. That’s it’s important everyone else get it, can’t still benefit herd immunity. done away despicable industry.

10 14 million mink culled far. Non-infected mink farms continuing cull mink voluntarily farms refuse it.

Honestly, sounds negligible. clarify what's question exactly help answer it.

Adenovirus (a common type virus come across everyday lives) used vector (a 'carrier') modified express spike protein found COVID. vector itself, although important, one several factors **may** effect efficacy - either increase decrease efficacy, actually know get trial results. answer question: "" Idk increases decreases efficacy"" - know point. ChAdOx-1 (The Oxford one described thread) shows likely 70% efficacy, mean we'll necessarily see results J&amp;J since also dependent many factors specific type adenovirus (Oxford's one common adenovirus chimpanzees), adenovirus modified, dosing regimen etc etc.

Maybe one place one city, many places fucking joke. trust treat paper cut. hear people sing...\*🎵

IIRC, end well protesters. know downvoted, never said get it, concerns. There's difference concerns whack-job anti-vaxxer. 

Would concerns abated learn vaccines already rigorously tested side effects worse associated flu vaccine? Jealous screen name. Germany already 200 daily deaths average, peak 300 deaths last days, worse first wave. slow make new measures, often bla bla nothing happens. least consider prolong lockdown 20th December. took every single precaution except ones inconvenient us. chart also 'cost' column. stop admitting sick people hospitals. Problem solved. normal person concerned side effects, companies making too. Ignore /u/sam1405 (probably someone living mum basement trying edgy website) focus companies publish understand side effects, side effects prevalent exist. 


Then weight sars\_cov\_2 possibility covid developing. 


I believe anyone really see simple things soon weight parameters. like horrible swine flu vaccine hit norther europe swine flu, sars\_cov\_2 real fucking world. real effect unless belts opera specific vocal gymnastics require extra long notes amplitude. 

You're Larynx changes pitch tone notes, lungs air bags make go, unless extremely damaged going make much different. muscle memory training mostly throat ears. 

That's old people still sing even though reduced lung function youth, makes voice decay aging larynx larynx vocal folds age along rest body, affecting multiple aspects vocal fold anatomy function. muscle vocal fold atrophies, much like muscle elsewhere body. flexible tissues responsible vocal fold vibration voicing (known superficial lamina propria) become thinner, stiffer less pliable. addition, tremor larynx may add wobbly quality voice elderly, similar way hands may noted shake. Together, changes sometimes result voice perceived sounding “old”. Let guess, “Plandemic?” small sample size

11,000 people small sample size? Assuming get people come back second time True, yet doctors tell people wear mask stop spread virus...

I guess long fear getting sick, matter... Wonder guy. Age/ location seem Like said, fucking moron. better shit toilet?  September, 50% country wanted vaccine. Recently, Gallup polled 58%. rate, we'd gave 74% Americans willing take vaccine March 2021, enough achieve immunity. Except requires “right dosing regime” poor places often difficult achieve. narrative think trying pushed? incredibly infectious deadly disease running rampant US? that's what's actually happening...  said don’t support people, find way make money outside system despite closure. 2 doses? cynical side says there's profit motive play.

Contrary many believe, big companies often play long-game. Planning ahead many years. Could setting stage annual boosters and/or related vaccines?

Maybe none companies listed that, pandemic illustrated well, one take anything face value. Hope best, skeptical cautious along way. Ok, playing devil's advocate, someone to.

With said, based publicly released information far, vaccines looking promising.

On aside, extra-low temp requirement Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine likely much issue many led believe. However, increase cost distribution somewhat. Whether difference matters, time tell. God loathe Trump. \*insert Marty McFly meme\*

I kid. Even vaccine, think we'll return ""normal"" quickly. hope summer. 

Disclaimer: I'd love wrong everything fine April. countries really open. demand 14 day quarantine arrival effectively bans people coming tourist. new study 240 patients showed benefit, single-dose 200k Getting oxygen set pain too. Overflow rooms already difficulty providing adequate care still hospital Wait, storage -70 C? That's cold Transparency Bidet team, assemble! what? He’s charge whole time good news vaccine antibody side. would change? He’s attention praise. safe, get authorization. Would feel ok know 40% people come contact might get employees sick? comfortable responsible bringing home disease kill elders people know extremely vulnerable cannot 3 people 100 die. risk management cannot even begin allow operations high risk margins. Vaccines great step forward need realistic fully reopen quickly safely. Dragging shutdown another year waiting see goes tremendous collateral human, educational, financial damage. test capacity almost ready need roll asap. Exactly. expert. yes, God warning us pay attention x values americans wana accelerate shit cause stupid people

They probably know use tho.. Agree. me, photo Robert Marsh look eerily like Harold Ramus Egon original Ghostbusters? concerts return return twice well. least know I'll going bars often before, least first couple months. can't imagine concert festival fans going everything afford go get another booster. risk low. 1. I’m saying haven’t seen information ban mink farming Denmark. Asking question I’ve missed info. 
2. post comment saying ill informed refrain commenting
3. conclude source, later update, trade banned, paused.
4. ask examples misinformed. 

I’m done discussion. It’s really leading anything. nearly enough people wearing mask Bay Area. Stopped reading “DEY” assure scientist pharmaceutical industry works new drugs, testing RIDICULOUSLY overkill. fucking way thing going harm slightest. Well, hoping so. 41 immunized child new MMR vaccine booster maybe ~15 years ago precaution. husband little older also new MMR vaccine 20s due employment. No, flairs reflect changes headlines. know Pfizer Moderna one not-for-profit cheaper produce. 

Jumping conclusions, American ones might prohibitively expensive developing countries. genuinely think Moncef Slaoui accounting distribution hurdles?  Yes, Dear Leader making matter fealty avoid basic hygiene certainly help. Evidence, proof 70% weighted average two different regimens one 90%. Though less efficacious two, it’s much cheaper needs stored refrigerator unlike two require freezers (one requires like -80C around -20C believe). huge rural developing areas. Yep, Taiwan, Singapore, etc. look eminently livable right now. people think chicken littles screaming past six months?

They probably think happens liberals big cities something. idk. I'm anti vaxxer said concerns side effects even said wanted vaccine. Go back /r/Conservative facts fiction. super sad Can’t wait turn hulk taking mystery juice shot case less more?

1/2 initial dose leads stronger efficancy? thats great news get effeicenny 25% less vaccine.  Fair question, guess subjective depends much someone trusts official data.

BMW thought provide accurate pollution data diesel vehicles someone found (years later) something right. feel trust eroded large corporations. Sub-prime loans -- crisis came, everyone said ""they knew unstable"". somehow stopped before.

Lately many scandals admit, trust 100% Sorry three Providing issues getting enough doses roll fairly quickly yh could looking around April majority population vaccinated bitching real, refusing implement common sense mask mandates, voting president whose incompetence made pandemic worse. 

Please see home state Wisconsin evidence. Sick antivaxxers going get people killed. Hello Australia. 14 new cases today memory. Save breath, people even know cells RNA DNA. cells are. DNA/RNA are. America


Fuck yeah Man, glad charge. plan dumb naive. risk reward ratio really low. would recommend anyone older 40 get MMR shot. Alright.

Prove it. Quit come help state believes virus. Probably better pay Utah That's ridiculous, global pandemic world full developing nations one person bring country cause national outbreak. going come closer eradicating eradicating Flu vaccine last forever. get immune years scenario that's scenario likely ever eradicate GIVEN also genetically stable enough, unlike flu. .. short .. going eradicate highly infectious disease mostly produces short term immunity vaccine also produces short term immunity. 

THIS AIN'T MEASEL VACCINE PEOPLE. going last life half life anything really convenient like that.

Why would say things obviously false? Even true, would still result vaccines faster every company government ability make knew so, 'recipe' speak known  


I'm sure whether correctly understood saying here. Yeah, that's case current pandemic next one. reason private companies close release vaccine fast prospected return investment. take away get fast vaccines future anymore. You’re wrong

Isn’t sad think about? could reduced lot deaths shoving people sun little bit giving salmon eggs Bad time drunk drivers...get word out.😳  agreed, blood test every expensive. know Moncef Slaoui? ""Not actively running getting sick"" = Eliminating recreational drug alcohol use, eating balanced diet, getting adequate rest, staying hydrated, exercising regularly, driving safe rates speed conditions, avoiding risky behaviors.

Everyone following list showing respect health care workers whose job keep alive. Yes, major problem Ebola vaccines. It’s switched chimpanzee virus ensure one before. That’s pretty much boils to. one mRNA vaccine 1 year point. using non replicating cold virus vectors new. vaccines 90% effective, would go AZ JnJ Alright.

Prove it. Look - despise every single republican politician - even accept leadership (however poor) needs maintained. scale 50 million initial doses....a thousand impactful. 

I imagine top level politicians easily first groups. surprising, flout basic hygiene way show loyalty Dear Leader. 100% made right choice. think we’ve forgotten lasting, debilitating effects don’t understand don’t know treat effecting people 20-40 mild case covid didn’t require hospitalization. Scarier covid itself. EA, old rascal! They’re yet report. Expecting results next weeks. expand trials times covid slowed UK time got going surprising it’s taking little longer results pull through. darwinism work disagree sentiment. based presumption people deceive start. believe people inherently good, simply trying survive. yes, ample cases fraud abuse, exceptions, rule. fair people genuinely need assistance driven hard prove it, sake preventing statistically irrelevant number cases fraud. believe money lost fraud simply part cost helping need. spent time, money, effort resolving problems push people deceit, fewer people would resort it. Crime falls, need lifeline get help need, economy, society, culture benefit it. realize covid studies changed stuff often remember one study saying typical brain tickling test works starting day 5 infection. another study said contagious day 1.5 2 contact. competitive professional natural bodybuilder squat 500 lbs. soldier, infantry Marine. patronize subject matter understand literally live everyday. zero data suggest resistance training leads prevalence, ZERO. since forum praises data, check out:
 doors open fresh air circulating, masks worn, items clean, reason facilities closed. Woooweee got us helluva b ball team! Definitely, possibly...misspoke rude it’s simply interesting me. much happening right go back complain February, anyway. I'm sorry, I've spent holidays alone really hated it. Thanks taking one team. Hope next year good time. have, alas, still found proof anything, either direction. Canadian History class talking Hudson Bay Company would like American History class talking Louisiana Purchase. It’s incredibly important part history. ovaries would appropriate...and probably invasive...you missed opportunity ""breasticles""... argument ""my job keep alive, show fucking respect field profession actively running getting sick.""

This equivalent taking shit floor saying ""well job clean up.""

Yes, job clean first place. hospital rural Texas, ICU hospital full weeks. state sent us critical care doc New Orleans run ICU. 

I'm primary care doc runs rural health clinic county - last time ran vent residency (2015). hospitalist team staffed hybrid MD/NPs critical care docs. Thankfully state stepped help.

Right now, many patients managed Vapotherm attempt avoid intubation. RTFA kid geometry third probability. Oh nooooo! block total stranger never want interact again! do! 

Lol safe buddy go out. will, remember people don’t get make choice make. Ken Paxton. Dan Patrick. Greg Abbott. legislature awful writ large, three monsters never allowed escape true legacy. I'm afraid cars, I'm playing traffic either. I’ve lived say is...Fuck Texass. treat workers like shit. elect horrible, stupid human beings positions power. still much like “old south”. Corrupt, ignorant racist claim good Christians.  True story. used work guy shake breakfast, shake lunch. dinner came actually ordered ate two different heavy fast food dinners. ask says shakes substitutes ""meals time"", meant could double dinner. told that's worked, insisted sound diet.

If think that's dumb, used manager would drink meal replacement weight loss shakes *in addition* regular daily meals snacks ""the shakes help lose weight."" 

That 25 years ago still alive assume handling pandemic dumbest possible way, probably wearing mask asshole instead mouth. based what's happening Florida bars we'll get well vaccine arrives... :-/ would say get ~5 months since covid forgot add funerals list thing people missing money put fighting claim could done right think fucking paid come ahead evenish. disgusting. deserve benefits. Senators house sure taking cut anything certainly front lines anything. “horrible government”

- political much? system must certain amount roadblocks many people making dishonest claims. 

How many? Natural selection simply simplicity. silly willy, yes fly work. keeping minimum right much put off. It’s pretty easy get idea people traveling quick look. 

The amount people flying vacation/pleasure (whatever want call it) disturbing. Yeah highly biased main stream media of... National Geographic article lmao label science proves wrong “media brainwashing” lmao 

And sadly leave house cause I’m essential worker. day hear families lost dad cause three people isn’t ten. boy lost parents within days one picture grandma okay. 20 year old can’t walk end room without gasping air despite negative two months. people telling “I everything could, one gathering couldn’t bad.” 

And listen I’ve snarky well get point across you. maybe friends safe bubble four people don’t see anyone guys. hope that’s case. really I’ve seen virus it’s not. 

All I’m saying you’re going hang 4 people sure it’s risk ABSOLUTELY take. Mental health important it’s seeing four people slipping kind depression whatever it. know risk. guys feel even little sick reschedule it. masks, outdoors wait bit till get negative test. smart safe. no. im trying figure waste time agree anyway. Really don’t feel bad them. Sorry That’s definitely fire hazard.

so? 4 C way freezer temperature though, 0 C water starts get solid, freezers usually around -18 C. Fucking Sinclair Broadcast site. I'm sure cropped photo happens look like horns totally coincidence. totally missed point. similar thing Halloween too, drive thru trick treating. Kidlet got dress show costume, drove family's houses instead going neighborhood. ideal made best it. Podcast/episode? Got link? Reminds legal system  odd. bodies already refrigerated trucks, might well take places cheaper crematoria. think compliance lower quarantine orders? Even crazier regard black death, religious zealots would travel Europe go town town flogging way punish hopes God would show mercy since widely believed time plague punishment humanity sins. lead people getting infected one town, travelling another reason inflict flesh wounds onto course spread disease. somewhat agree everyone going different risk tolerance. think important trustworthy local government health departments issue guidelines people actually follow. Maybe areas, safe gather small groups indoors. probably many places summer, right now, think country. 

And easy telling high risk people stay home want get sick. Many people still leave homes buy groceries, get necessary medical treatment even work essential jobs. Even quarantine, still leave house occasionally basic items. You’re far likely get virus half people grocery store partying weeks aren’t wearing masks majority people quarantining wearing masks like be. case agree: it’s fucked pack bars without safety measures. It’s impression upvoted comments sub usually people talking don’t understand people something boasting don’t see they’re parents live half mile away since june last year. That’s say attitude: looks like people competition behaves *better*. way black white situation nuanced, pandemic complex across board. amount bureaucracy involved making harder people get benefits need often costs much people making ""fraudulent"" claims. Somehow regular person get extra 10 bucks ebt card entire system must erected stop you, billionaire pay taxes fine. commit fraud massive scale get bailed government (2008 banking crisis) pay fine costs 1% stole (wells fargo mass fraud comes mind, financial crimes fall umbrella too)  


We spend much time crushing regular people rich suck world dry. done already.

Funny, say possible solution (infect isolate done it) I’m looked weirdo. *segue Show take 100,000 lbs equipment facility 30 degree weather prolonged period time maintaining security reducing chance degradation. cannot. need to. viral load prevalent amongst avid gym goers would seen data now.

Lots non competitive athletes thread idea takes achieve high level performance gym. Lots people understanding cardiovascular exercise resistance training two completely different things.

Locking resistance training facility doors open, masks on, items clean fine. Hell, hands physical therapy massage allowed state training, requires zero contact another person, not.

Its laughable. much fuss even leading cause death US... However common sense dictates mouthwash neutralize virus mouth. problem respiratory virus it’s deeper nostrils tracheae mouth. Also virus enters cells wouldn’t neutralized surface cleansing more. letting millions die plague 21st century terrifyingly dystopia? Also also yes. Nope reward systems neighbors report gatherings. truly needs group effort track scumbags give deserve! 2 half weeks, one infected person bar leads 256 infected people, many age demographic ... 1 2 dead weeks that. That's one person carrying virus there. probably 5 7 carriers bar. multiply initial figure 5 7 ... one superspreader, watch out. right turn county disaster area. 80% people get asymptomatic, means spread even symptoms, means eventually everyone going get unless vaccine effective. Either way, people get quite ill die. I'm downplaying severity it. nasty thing, contagious. also overblown, people, big deal. 

I'm relatively young, quite healthy, contact anyone high risk category. get it, I'll isolate I'm better, I'll move life. 

I'm sorry everyone willing hide basement boogeyman goes away. makes sense. agree aren’t sure would happen time. I’m sure extrapolate you’re saying really appreciate discussing civilly. doubt outdoor indoor but.... literally thousands people partying major cities country announcement. Idk... think us support new admin also self aware actions. Yes read article. Daily testing works better high compliance rates low community spread. community spread, removing isolation requirement make things worse. UK tons uncontrolled spread already. change isnt likely help anti-vaxxers, also thinks pandemic vaccine found. Without taking fact access months later consideration, partying again. Brazil's health ministry said Sunday sign non-binding letters intent purchase coronavirus vaccines four companies Russia's sovereign wealth fund, adding purchase depend approval nation's According ministry, officials met last week representatives Pfizer Inc, India's Bharat Biotech, Russian Direct Investment Fund, Moderna Inc Janssen, unit Johnson &amp; statement, ministry said legal technical departments analyzing documents presented five entities determining best way go purchasing vaccines ""the opportune government contracts place guarantee access 142,900,000 coronavirus vaccine doses, enough immunize least third Brazil's population, officials said far, Brazilian federal government's main bet vaccine developed AstraZeneca PLC, already signed supply Sao Paulo, Brazil's largest state, local authorities signed deal China's Sinovac Biotech Ltd test produce vaccine locally. Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, long-time critic China, dismissed vaccine untrustworthy, without presenting evidence.

Gotta catch ‘em all? Yup! Yeah bars clubs closed CA whereas fully open Texas evidence people go there. people give virus people. deep-fried ice cream long ago. interesting novelty, recall actually tasting good. Can't imagine restaurants would use good-quality ice cream it.

(~30 years ago, seemed popular Mexican restaurants US dessert menu. really know since think thing Mexico.) predict restaurants bars close thanksgiving. governors starting crack down! mean business We're extra cautious right husband working covid patients several family members health issues would dangerous covid. know sister law going help cooking works home go out, MIL. Yup, 3-4 meals everyone takes masks 15-30 minutes time. Well, live? live FL maybe party together take pics send dorky ass shiver away Vermont. not? Republicans snapped fingers dropped taxes rich. go one way?

/doesn’t debt Gavin Newsom smiling fact put many people work Christmas. business French Laundry Taiwan never locked anything one best performing countries comes Covid. question get it? 


I work group nursing facilities.  resources house vaccine.  doubt facility able administer vaccine in-house like flu shot.  
  
I wonder going get access vaccine coming month(s). feel like makes sense distribution truck vaccine event parking lot. They’ll probably go eat loved one ICU, “the hospital won’t let us in, something pass time stressed”... took stats AP course, around 2006. otherwise remember learning besides one instance. Yeah, good luck that. don’t get infected people quarantine. everyone quarantine indefinitely? much fighting around Thanksgiving. can't believe it. LA never indoor dining. closed outdoor dining put massive number folks work right Christmas get middle finger, lot. story serve reminder us cancel Thanksgiving, Christmas, basically anything else planned first quarter year. We’re together need stay safe, stay home, stay course. economy wait people! personally know Purple Heart Vietnam vet huge scars arm literally blown gave going VA hospital bureaucratic nightmare care shitty far away. thankfully good health insurance job used instead. business shut down, someone let go, go unemployment. get stay home, even opportunities work. works many. 

If can't pay 20 bucks instacart, friend deliver groceries you. worried ""shifting risk"" need to. Plenty people care risk, fine idea getting it. 

I agree it, isolate go public till better. 

As rights, thankfully way laws united States written, rights protected US constitution, that, eternally thankful. must high. That's many people left per 100ks look great. essential workers actually live city. Speakeasys. Even Enlightened Boston Cambridge, it’s impossible find bar acting like bar.

Hell, joined speakeasy gym Chairman Baker shut Commonwealth. wonder fast they’ll get tent forgiveness. Countries starting push back won’t provide evidence said tests affected countries. It’s actually huge deal trade standpoint lot industries depend heavily Chinese consumers. single country world taken similar action banning trade goods. Cool, I’m blocking now. shows mask mandate Kansas, cases decreased counties observed, continued increase counties examples? Right tribe me, wife, son.

Everybody else fuck die far care. We're staying inside. need shoot welfare officer something? skim article. instead requiring/offering daily testing 7 days. every wealthy country doing. next step testing everyone every day/week/whatever, easily achievable pooling low positivity.

For sure clickbait misleading headline though.  don’t know you’re talking sounds like tradition need embrace non-American watching outside:

Wow, government really hates guys, huh? Well, better work lower daily case number. Come on. Gotta push through.  production ice cream involve much manual operation meat plant.

So, long workers food factory didn\`t spit icecream, safe.  That’s nice way dodge fact odds majority people dying ridiculously low.

I’d love see age demographics hospitals currently “overrun”. Well hopefully virus controlled time see rest country -- governed sensible people. G-19 leaders. honestly understand humanity. one traveling anywhere, state, country, especially country another one except essential essential services. prolonging pandemic basic thing. Avoid people.

 [cbc news saying US could reach 70% vaccinated qualified statement little next reply comment chain, care read that. However, talking values here, practicalities. One set whatever boundaries values one likes, including ones bring two values competition. happened repeatedly discourses restriction versus freedom relation pandemic responses.

That said - gyms, restaurants high street clothes shops essential services survival humans.

I'm old enough rise flame-bait. People visit families care them. didn’t care family would stay home. need extreme isolation pandemic. think misunderstood xd he's disabled. works currently (but accounting). graduated university September bachelor's degree accounting, decided wait till elections get accounting job, rn online work. he's searching job tax. I'm also moving another year need set things first also need savings side. 
He's immigant yes, situation bit special. family offered asylum fleeing government Venezula. father worked Venezulan government oil, pretty well themselves. Government pulled crap flee preserve lives pretty much. everything including social security, legally, five years. political turmoil backlog family revieved citizenship asylum yet even gotten appointment. bs, happens. he's planning try different route.

As fallback plans honestly family disliking relationship. Granted they'd take back to, leave, it'd drama. 

Nothing situation easy. even things work uncle, citizen, lives state SO, could stay him. happened fall love someone country also another reason, apart health, wanting leave. I'm comfortable mentioning much idk depth get sub. long story short abused child teenager. still see abusers. need get away. would much easier healthy great job lots money. life afforded either. last big family dinner. food served individual containers 'serving', everything pre-packaged. I'm kind lucky even COVID looking retrain anyway (and keep IA card part-time work) mentally ready big change unlike lot people industry. sitting juices hours, falling apart soaking greasy liquid

You make sound like bad thing! Currently drooling... Texas them. That's bargain. honest gotten 95% effective vaccine done this. would waste energy, since time get everyone able get it. battle Stalingrad lasted year 2 million deaths, yes got hand people one another I... Wow. That's brutally cynical. die. feel bad anyone can't get treatment. time, seems way dumb country going learn body's start piling up. claims denied initially, large percentage yes, nowhere near all. 

The system HORRIBLE think people sometimes forgot everyone applying benefits truly disabled. people deserve denied I’m afraid. sometimes people denied reasons medical condition. work table 30 years, you’re even insured SS disability benefits, regardless lost use every single limb. 

**I work SSD attorneys familiar process. one jailer? give money, fucking ghouls! was. point Reddit leans left can’t critique democratic governor criticize republican president. It’s dumb point corrected him. Literally killing people leveraging willingness save people lives them. America truly evil country.

We'll see, government gave conditional sailing approval decided accord start business, say numbers January lead another delay.

Mitigating spread continuing take precautions proper vaccine created. Also, cure can't worse virus itself, fear rushed vaccine. I'm sure sending missiles Israel certainly help aid. think sarcastic.

Good fucking luck there! get vaccinated vaccinations plentiful since natural immunity contracting virus May.

Sweden 6400 deaths right (maybe more, there's lag 4 weeks way report deaths), closest neighbour (Denmark) even 800.    
Sweden twice cases rest Scandinavia *all together* even *test less* per capita.

They're ""surprisingly well although well neighbours"" - majority world FYI; they're surprisingly bad although bad worst hit countries.    
And that? Well... long story. read article. You, clearly, not.

Your link supports exactly article CDC Kansas Department Health Environment analyzed trends county-level cases mandate went effect two months afterward. Though rates considerably higher 24 counties required masks, two-month study period brought growth cases control even reduced them. counties require masks continued see cases increase.

Which KDHE supports reason make sense reason said make sense anyone reads it. 

It's apt analogy, clearly worked instead refuting made word salad insults due well represented comment. Sue court then. employer can’t retaliate reporting safety violations (at least MI) fact rates similar outside now, otherwise would worse. 

Think way, numbers US three weeks now, would great news. Sometimes things go better could have. health care 40 years. last decades, putting fires. crisis highlighting issues health care delivery United States.  That’s reason excuse irresponsible harming people guise “freedom good time”  hit nail head. There’s much shaming individuals everywhere makes sick stomach. governments one clear job provide common safety citizens completely failed us.

I’m thanksgiving responsibly direct family (parents brother) start casting stones everbody remember really failed. It’s actually true laws wouldn’t even allow Biden thing 
And much American population outright disobey rules spite government can't come anything sounds reasonable time shocked either. People would take mask wearing seriously politicians would lead example stop photographed midst crowd without masks dinner parties telling people stay home. point isn’t proven. half dose arm study wasn’t full study terms participants. spamming comment repeatedly doesn’t change that, explain half dose/full dose would effective.  Probably company tells truth. Yes actually care moral virtue signaling champions world, ones told yet, heros wear capes wear masks, thank saving mankind. Fuck anyone worried catching spreading virus stay home good luck rest America who’s barley making lockdowns misrepresent you. told someone educate brought bible. accurately pointed bible educational material therefore serves benefit. making correct decision block you. fact like half reason even testing people first place. dunno, bet well. see others it, becomes mandatory certain things, crucially options 90% effective so.  Right on. happy accident. Always unnerving hear dosing error, glad know turned good news. yea 16 would fair age, trials children 12 started last week extremely slim chance adults issues vaccine children would grow 3rd arm something 11 year olds really given much autonomy. Starting rationing less care anti-maskers pandemic deniers would good start. still looking job Agent broker? work larger company offices Chicago. let know. Might able help out. Crazy times all. realize science fiction dystopia also mass deaths - cremated bodies fast possible.

More importantly middle ground two scenarios describe. I'm super jazzed vaccine, tricky part though available people massive winter/spring peak. I'm hoping people taking precautions jump gun stop taking precautions meantime . sucks, vaccine still time protect us darkest phase pandemic reading article confused, half dose effective full dose? Yes, technically right safe work environment, one wearing mask concerned virus, health department osha turns anonymous tip concerned employee, boss knows exactly fire poor performance. issue switching jobs much harder now. got new job ended quiting 3 days lax mask wearing wasnt comfortable covid protocols ( interview seemed great, really pissed realize sucked mask wearing) Back old job great covid safety afraid try finding another job ending unsafe environment. You’re adding word “fuck” make seem heartless. engage argument don’t. one stopping anyone taking precautions feel necessary protect themselves. Find job work home pay someone pick groceries you’re scared. It’s you. Amen amen.  people luxury going somewhere else middle pandemic escape wealthy. largely wealthy (and WFH privileged class) going rural areas escape everyone else stay city, shackled job. know single person left home, I'm part unwashed masses.

Once again, division wealthy vs working class. think US necessarily lacks knowledge do, rather lack necessary. However, help welcome anyone. Yeah I'm good getting poked Good point. also: fuck it. I'll take vaccine left nut point. “need“ would preventing catching coronavirus spreading people - likely end hospitalized dead you.

Or never ever physically interact anyone 21, hidden obvious health issues? professors, classmates, parents, grandparents, cashiers, bartenders, dating hookups, roommates, etc? Plus families catch get sick? live work alone wilderness get supplies delivered you’re risk others, that’s people don’t need vaccinating. paraphrased Peter Hotez working Sanofi vaccine worked original SARS vaccine eradicated: yes. That's planned himself, actually. Taking first available vaccine build resistance virus, taking best one determined data. Seeing 10,000 deaths 1 week crazy We're talking antimasker social butterflies...not going mask. Listen, still work essential services job liquor store. I'm ""scared""...I worked way first lockdown I'll working second wave's lockdown too. summer long, people asking want go drinks...am going bar, taking mask, getting smashed friends getting smashed suddenly, turn around someone's laughing talking face? Oh hell NO! What, work least month? what? Maybe I'll breath can't even carry groceries car house? it'll take 15 mins walk stairs basement laundry? can't get bed make breakfast? 

It's ""rare"" might think. know guy 50s died ventilator. pre-existing conditions athletic. friend, 40s, unfortunate enough get work...she hospitalized dehydration, go ER post-trial blood clot leg, long hauler shortness breath (she never smoker), chronic fatigue aches (headaches)...and energy anything since contracted virus early April...and end November. smallish circle people know. people know? 

It's nothing wear mask delay seeing people while. mean I'm living life. I'm fine going drinks friends. talk via text, face time, phone whatever. worth long hauler knows long sake hours socializing.

I'm telling you...it looks like sucks. I'm going anything absolutely necessary, I'm going wading crowds day Christmas shopping, I'm going anyone's christmas dinner, I'm going holiday drinks friends  get mom take coronavirus seriously? almost 62 high blood pressure asthma. told went mall sunday (""there thousands people there"") also wearing mask getting nails done. 

She even acknowledges two aunts (my dad's sister brother's wife) doctors super concerned coronavirus. said ""shouldnt set alarm bells two concerned people doctors?"" says ""nope!"" 

I really know get point. hard us replicate success given stupid, brainwashed, self-destructively non-compliant many people America.

 [Vaccine Possibilities | Pipeline long vaccine protection last?**  one can’t answered total confidence way waiting watching. able give meaningful answer well that, fortunately. last couple days, long-term comprehensive look duration immunity recovered coronavirus patients. fact, appears largest detailed study post-viral-infection immunity entire medical literature (!) It’s multi-center team La Jolla Institute Immunology, UCSD, Mt. Sinai, looks 185 patients range infection experiences, asymptomatic severe. 38 subjects provided longitudinal blood samples across six months.  already seen convalescent plasma comparison samples various vaccine Phase trials antibody response coronavirus infection quite variable, case study well. gives wide error bars try calculate half-lives, it’s even clear kind decay curve antibody levels best fit (it might well different different patients). one figure take home 90% subjects still seropositive neutralizing antibodies 6 8 month time points. authors point primate studies, even low titers neutralizing antibodies still largely protective, humans work similarly, that’s good sign. even better sign, though, numbers memory B cells, long-term antibody producers help provide immunological memory. B-cells specific Spike nucleocapsid coronavirus proteins actually *increased* five-month period post-symptom-onset, thus apparent half-life all. interesting variations antibody type (by end period, strongly IgG, others dropped off), paper notes, really don’t many viral infection profiles humans compare results to. B-cell memory overall, though, looks long-lasting, expected results stretch years. it’s worth, patients survived 1918 influenza pandemic B cells [**still fresh neutralizing antibodies 90 years, rather hardy.  immune (and immune memory) component, cells? news good well. CD4+ CD8+ memory cells appear half-lives least five six months patients, helper cells (crucial memory B cells respond later on) completely stable entire period studied. Again, viral infection studies compare one to, numbers look consistent long-term protection via reactivated immune memory.  whole set patients, clear immune system’s famously individual character full display here. heterogeneity could well reason [**real cases although still seems rare. Different components immune response (both antibodies cells) varied widely among patients, differences became pronounced time. Nevertheless, five-month time point measure five components immune response memory, 96% patients still positive least three (the categories IgG antibodies Spike receptor-binding domain (RBD), IgA antibodies Spike RBD, memory B cells aimed RBD, total SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cells, total SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ T cells).  line: Taken together, study, [**several past months, [**this recent paint consistent picture strong, normal, lasting immune response great majority patients. Add results we’re seeing two vaccines reported interim data far, think **the prospects lasting immunity vaccination also good**. Remember, early vaccine data suggested antibody responses least strong found naturally infected cases. seems (so far) every reason think vaccine-based immunity good better conferred actual coronavirus infection. much look forward data shore conclusion, that’s looks moment. Mobilize national guard units, particularly individuals medical training. already happened. people giving freedom see it. collectivist ideology paving way Communism. Future communist governments use technology control population abuse power. That's societies work. 

They start slow masks, lockdowns, mandatory vaccines airlines, drivers licenses, etc, etc.

Does anyone see going? Mandatory vaccinations abused governments see electronic communications phone activity. Look modern history. glad least country producer  also send food. mom works main Mayo campus MN whole department booted space put another Covid Triage area. said several departments (derm, family medicine, etc) converted covid care already. Preach.  issue hospitals handle much. get point, cOvid becomes much deadly Well, comes post-Thanksgiving spike time ruin Christmas. seems kind obvious. People willing cancel Spring Break safe, 9 months big holidays coming up, people's resolve slipping. Unfortunately bad decisions 9 months make still problem now. right going serious problem that. feel people work Industries used work food service industry. Everything that's happened 2020 seriously affected family, I'm sure affected millions people United States world. really put perspective things matter me, unfortunately going movie theater, bars restaurants longer priority me. plan stepping foot another bar movie theater go restaurant it'll get to-go orders would much rather take home eat house. Unlike Pfizer Moderna one require freezer. So, merry motherfucking Christmas galloping towards us, dance edge Apocalypse. (talk shithole country, geez)  Priorities filling open spaces criteria like age, overall health, would still need open bed. forcibly removing someone previously given bed make room her. That's fine. asking feel bad antivaxxers. taken aback someone callous residual spread deadly disease.

“In United States, community transmission remained high many places schools started reopen August, proportion infections children continued climb, says Ashlesha Kaushik, paediatrician Sioux City, Iowa, spokesperson American Academy Pediatrics.

But unclear often outbreaks originate schools contribute community transmission, factors, including easing restrictions businesses gatherings, also contributed community spread. Increased testing later pandemic probably also boosted case numbers, says Kaushik.” Thats exactly concrete objective evidence assertion potus like... 90+70, 160% protection! interview Dr. Peter Hotez Doctor Radio talked high titers Sanofi vaccine. said neutralizing antibody titers strongly positively correlated protective immunity animal challenge trials.

[Here's print mentions antibody titers bunch stuff. [is soap fine washing away covid germs? mom fan, suspect fan base old realize they’d better every concert die either covid old age. part it. Also im assuming would done genome testing etc NZ find clusters linked think point people said “fuck it, it’s gonna go away, might well go on” (In worst case, new recombinant virus could appear RNA vaccine another virus would lead another worse pandemic).

I’d worried vaccine causing pandemic weren’t already pandemic impossible get without vaccine. fair, two factors mention important firstly, acting early. New Zealand went lockdown 200 known cases secondly, underrated opinion, weather lockdown. 7 weeks lockdown saw unseasonably fine weather especially April. Despite lockdown able go walks bike rides play within bubble outside. surely helped compliance levels stay home especially also continued get paid. That’s good. kids would end heavily indoctrinated parents beliefs. ""personal responsibility""

Aka, problem, mine Oof, sorry hear that. Lawn order... could also give know faking massacre taking guns nasty w*tch Count mother one thinks family worth risk...in phone conversation informs 8 y/o niece quarantined past week teacher best friend tested positive, also sobbing opted going home Thanksgiving Christmas year.

I love miss family I've seen since May, skipping single year holidays stay safe seem like super huge sacrifice me. Sadlibs 250k! like test faith think he's Arabian Jewish kid 30s middle east white guy wrote Constitution Ask they'd sign legally binding contract waiving right ventilator hospital bed in-exchange holidays. country can't even fucking wear masks dip shit way Unfortunately NYC spring. happens can’t handle volume patients. happen almost surely US coming weeks. Apparently size important, then, comes making intelligent health policies. US 27% bigger. we're going end 400-500k dead americans time done... 98.6% americans served Vietnam killed combat. Still, something create lot income someone. Yes Mel Brooks said  

# “Tragedy cut finger. Comedy fall open sewer die.” No. people called idiots refused wear mask, social distance, close business thought taking vitamin enough deterrent stop spread covid. jumped promoting Hydroxychloroquine miracle cure. literally possible regardless politicizing. lot Americans believe government working interests. one party other. whole system corrupt listen. could cure cognitive dissonance. gives insight people care pandemic keep traveling flying. figured media circus. “worth risk” means don’t care risk pose essential medical workers get Covid end hospital, carry communities asymptomatic super-spreaders. RIP get it. Like parts thanksgiving suck, I’m absolutely devastated I’ll skip thanksgiving due quarantine. It’s one times get see nieces. forget things surround holidays well like Christmas shopping events like lighting trees ice skating shows. amount traveling get around holidays. hotel stays. bringing gifts family nursing homes. amount doctors/nurses taking holiday time hospitals start filling up. ones resort violence, arrest.

For others, craft messages designed hear. ignore dismiss them. treat like idiots. condemn uneducated. try deal racial equality pandemic response message.

The US terrible job messaging, going way top. think superintendent poor enough incarcerated. conventions too. yearly plan big one year obviously get cancelled hope next year really go it! Well huge sample size, guess doctor family health clinic moving direction.

For youngest kid ear literally explode we'd get antibiotics it. basis think risk big “well let’s wait make sure”. 

There's reason vaccine usually take 10 years sure safe (and even sometimes aren't).

And talking new kind vaccine lot unknown top that.

Back summer, patient erupting shingles sores trying figure out/remember level precautions needed use appropriate signage put door. So, like usual, go CDC website find info. charge nurse, mostly kidding (?) says, ""Oh, fuck CDC."" deflating felt way. 

Obviously, still rely CDC Biden's administration repair work do, think receive warm welcome. Cases dropped. Looks like hospitalizations next couple think pretty clear employer ignores workers' safety, time first responses looking past. I’m sure would also parents pull kids school prevent vaccinated.

Good. I'm planning pull kids daycare week. - appearing altruistic - obviously domestic political point scoring. first thought. want go bar get beer. /s? Oh, way 1/3 parents. Awesome! I'd love know progress made treating/preventing possible long term effects disease well. continuing collect data everyone study, least another year so.

It's likely general public access vaccine summer fall next year. lockdowns work though? Melbourne cases atm, second wave. Age alternative facts. And, yet, SD's cases clearly rolled 10 days dropped. Uh, almost Farr knew talking two grades protection, sterilizing immunity means get infected all, lesser grade get infected mild symptoms.   yet known various vaccines produce. Water also reported wet, experts say.  I'll give guy points creativity honesty. saw two women bus stop probably 4 months ago anti lockdown protest Adelaide kid one sign like “please think children” like turned Simpsons fukn dumb people. Jeez experience. kid goes ear infection, fever comes antibiotics every time.

Movies TV shows drastically negative affect public's opinion CDC, thinks huge pillar fighting diseases like said military checkpoints, hazmat suits, on. that. mostly collective scientists doctors outline real authority fast gets done. You’re wrong, decreasing...but hospitalizations deaths haven’t peaked yet (2-4 weeks behind case rates). AND...Thanksgiving. I’m guessing we’ll see dip next two weeks we’ll see case rates go up...not Dakotas Iowa, across country. Family takes breath away literally. undermines point how?

That’s anecdotal, I’m pretty confident lot people don’t believe virus real, it’s dangerous. one. Masks religion Freedumb 160,000+ cases every day tells people smart... Yep. work one. really hard stomach going work past 3 weeks. going get worse. *facepalm* Europe going winter, Australia going summer.

Silver lining! Nah, would incite mass hoarding. Refer shelves stores devoid toilet paper weeks reference. People selfish jackasses. El Paso thinks that's great idea. Onion literally wrote story satire months ago... can’t even. Thank do.  entire situation boggles mind. nobody: 


americans confronted problem: JAIL America. never give people help. always make sure much bureaucratic red tape many flaming hoops jump put way. fuck wrong you? can't order free test without symptoms. That’s world live in. people attempt treat real illnesses berry juices plant oils instead actual proven medication. half arse lifted restrictions soon . Countries hard lockdowns expected less drop gdp year. Australia almost back normal big Christmas sales expected new jobs. state NSW announced 4x$25 voucher every adult spend restaurants, pubs, cinema food entertainment places TLDR: lockdowns work elimination possible think right people sick of. They’re sick hearing claims millions people gathered street summer “didn’t spread COVID” simultaneously told they’re “killing grandma” want see family members.

It’s weird stance take. Stop weird. Start consistent. Isn’t Europe problem? 

Your ignorance assuming it’s uniquely American thing. It’s not. It’s Western thing. Sadly cannot afford option I'm struggling even pay groceries point. Doctor Bosnia suggested days ago use Vitamine rehabilitation. dreaming real doctors Bosnia front Belgium? :) Sadly, yes!!!  Yes - agree there. Exactly... Especially pigs. looking one inhumane industries examples humane treatment employees. drive every day multi ton deathtrap machine high speeds never accident, much less died.

So guess airbags seatbelts traffic laws totally unnecessary, it’s panicking sheep need them.

Or I’ve lucky. going need UV light bomb place. Yikes Every time world faced new revolutionary mass communications technology (e.g. printing, writing, newspaper) issues. It’s due authorship, importance written what, sourcing &amp; citing became prevalent early days printing press. faced new form communication fears there. adapt bc that’s done history.

Nah end world, end lot people live world. 11-14 year old denied appropriate medical care parents believe anti science nonsense? think depends country moment. family planning interstate holiday live Australia (2 hour flight) NZ it’s similar friends told me. No, death rate total deaths. specific, graph 7 day moving average new deaths / day, normalized population. 

 

It's rate deaths per infection that's trying say. rate, total. hear millions heads exploding! couple different issues think come play (although medical doctor, take grain salt):

First, infections reduce vitamin levels. known fact get sick, vitamin level drops. hard differentiate people already vitamin deficient deficient illness, unless person thorough medical records demonstrating this.

Second, doctor sees low vitamin levels, obligated treat low vitamin levels. know vitamin affect illness, especially respiratory tract illnesses. would malpractice doctor treat someone low vitamin D, could set double blind study group Covid patients low vitamin levels split one group receives vitamin one receives placebo. would super unethical run study, know one group going worse outcomes. don’t know much, don’t know whether low vitamin prior infection, every doctor regular vitamin deficiency testing, leading back point #1. 

So really tricky thing actually test. know helps, much known, hard set clinical trials determine. government needs lead actions words. long schools remain open virus going spread. understand completely. One intensive care doctors locally said need herd immunity start living life again. manages patients ventilators. posted Facebook like flu... meantime, nurse covid unit minimal help, patients falling, cared properly. Patients far ill ever seen flu, thats even long term effects.  think might area based end username FYI, getting money. fight make money permanent, rather congress renew every couple years. doubt benefits get renewed, issue making permanent, Bush Obama refused do.
 
Thank God Trump Mitch McConnell. there's evidence natural infection leads poor immune response possible re-infection. would depend reach herd immunity No, misinformation. 

Covid survive several days outdoor surfaces, apply unemployment benefits? hell, roommate household guest job let work home.  ""Could be"" theaters New York currently scheduled reopen 6/1/21 (closed since March 12th). I’m sure everyone employed hoping same, summer holiday months usually shows best. Spare effort......except maybe monetary, probably gonna much I've seen many articles lately, pointing givens things large portions country refuse 100 years later. 

I wonder we're ever going devolve level cholera makes comeback much country becomes ideologically opposed indoor plumbing. Ah random article Time, Sweden absolutely finished now! Kinda glad see this, sports bar area canopy seating setup also put tarp walls. place packed elbow elbow daily. better seating inside. Yeah, glad Republicans, Trump's leadership Mitch McConnell, finally made 9/11 funds permanent. remember Jon Stewart thanking that, really touching.

Sad everyone renewed benefits couple years (usually increases). Lost Pizzanista last round lockdowns. wife first date it’s Sunday mac-and-cheese pizza us. thought rapid tests don’t work well.  number people close proximity biggest factor determining risk. Filtration provide clean air, airplane filters circulate enough air prevent airborne transmission. Lowe humidity airplanes adds risk. Here's [an like learn more. Holy shit, too. :( exaggerated. many people US care neighbors community. sounds right. Everything's gonna suuuuuuuuuuck. John Stewart, *The Daily Show* fame. functioning government could plan like right US. And, man! can't fucking wait it! sucks someone else posted, truly lesser two evils. Hospitalizations rising rapidly, way save lives stage take drastic efforts. also know drastic measures work, think LA county making right choice here. 

I hope state government everything power help fund local businesses restrictive phase, I’ll best ordering takeout liberally personal budget permits! primarily speaking universities, think lasting effects K-12 (especially 6-12) well. feel bad 2 birthdays ruined COVID. :( Literally useless system.  Mitch McConnell never denied benefits. renewed increased everytime. permanent. worry, worry! They're working getting numbers down! Ohio Uber driver start turning better-looking stats hopefully next week! know disgusting. 

That they're forcing inmates that, easily risk prison-wide outbreak. enough deaths warrant corpse transportation hours end. think frustration government keeping everything open. People trampling eachother death giving eachother Covid next week black friday. pathetic response Trump admin gives many feeling ""fuck it, not, spreading exponentially already.""

Not I'm defending people course. Even back knew cover nose.

I’m going print hand 20% people see wearing chin straps covering nose.

I still can’t figure purpose protest odd way clueless.

I’m constantly dumbfounded “mask nose” people. Yep, gotta look small things this. 😂😂😂😂I saying need some. Yeah think close 4/5ths  No. think people least listen. bit misrepresentation. 9/11 first responders go without. funding always renewed increased. permanent. welcome. :) frustration watching tons people come COVID dying covidiocy's going last like April. 

Oh yeah, mind really *is* matter shit mental health completely ruins good time physically healthy body offers. I've hospitalized mental health reasons sucks much ass. :(

I send best regards wife's mental health hugely affected this, recovers quickly we're woods. Depends state. CA generally presumed fault state work comp claims. first responder fault issue presumed compensable. Add governor's order early summer recent senate assembly bills truly becomes benefit delivery system.

Fuck state isnt covering first responders. Especially state federal govt abandoned people nightmare. Latino immigrants cling natural/homeopathic cures

in experience, immigrants likely get vaccinated they've seen first hand happens don't. Anti-vaxxers tend Americans cuddled herd immunity bubble selfish prick become patriotic.

It's worse. people selfish, consciously want hurt people. Yup, tons distancing everyone wearing on. political people pretending rallies dangerous. Obviously Trump rallies bad (and likely worse), excuse these. Tens thousands businesses shut years many many small businesses permanently gone lockdowns. 

There currently provision welfare choose quit based health concerns, think would good idea introduce one congress. 

As rights infringed lockdown curfew, let's start with: 

The right move freely states, right travel freely please. theory regarded stupid work huge economic moral cost gaining naturally would lead minimum 30 million global deaths time infected enough people 

90%-95% effective vaccines allow reach herd immunity without costs  Fuck pro slavery bullshit. It’s shocking I’m desensitized point keep I’m stay healthy hope turn vaccine. 

Its like grief fatigue don’t know else explain it. Sort feels numb. He’s gonna get denied care due algorithm prioritizes someone younger position. like evolution? Covid weed people display specific feature, like realizing wearing masks washing hands smart things do? past 6 months different hospitals different regions approaching going capacity. This.  I'm glad worked 1000% correct. watched reports Denmark closely - dodged bullet. public isn’t educated fact we’re one bad mutation spreads unchecked (lockdowns infected areas happen US), vaccines don’t touch it... changes game.

Granted nearly mutations don’t change much, there’s always chance, especially amount spread US world much deadlier strains and/or strains vaccine useless begins spread.

The #1 topic I’ve following months. One little change spike protein elsewhere we’re whole new ball game. Fingers crossed make pandemic without mutation like Spanish flu. Stay safe there! One reason top 733,283 reasons live Tixes.  ""My family always said won’t us – protect ourselves. go work come back home. wear mask, wash hands, it’s OK us congregate.”

I trust family friends honest, **not** trust anybody’s subjective interpretation careful they’ve been. know many think careful clueless. Consider countries represented too. Well, 4 250 people however big plane was. Compared like wedding 40 guests get infected Yeah, evidence January 2020 super reliable. 🙄 me. confidence next Thanksgiving Christmas won’t quiet, at-home affairs again. I’m going get attached timeline keeps getting pushed back. 

Nicholas Cristakis, physician sociologist Yale, thinks period masking small gatherings last 2022, 2024 things really feel back normal. 

I highly recommend giving r/covidlonghaulers Amen that. Think working home many things posts delayed Reddit. might attempting cut backlog replies total reach 1,000. Reddit experience declines read replies timely fashion. 14 minute delay posts killing unpopular commentary single account holders. course we're talking Texas here. self-serving governor senators done nothing drive Texas ground everybody lives here. shameful part embarrassing part idiot voters even know what's happening keep voting useless f******. know, really much accepted even outside pandemic. People right actually enjoy rejuvenate holidays instead abused and/or exhausted. Cheer up! Eat strangers. add Thansgiving food suggestions, delicata squash pretty easy cook. rind edible wash it, cut half scoop seeds, slice desired, cook. squashes tend small overwhelmed leftovers. 

You cook slices pan, little bit boiling water start soften (probably 5-10 minutes depending thin slices are). also recipes cooking slices oven baking sheet. tastes good plain, add either pumpkin-pie-type spices (cinnamon, nutmeg) savory spices (rosemary, basil).

If that's cooking want do, there's always canned cranberry sauce. :D points infection viral shedding (i.e. infectiousness) high test sensitivity extremely low

Can please explain? rapid tests test positive based viral load. viral shedding high viral load low? I've always said, take word it. Google ""BLM protests virus spikes"" see yourself. studied epidemiologists. Facts facts. feel? ""Each us took exactly one precaution, make sure collectively covered all!""  law enforcement Millennials occasionally show polls so....there work do. “You might assume 95 every 100 people vaccinated protected Covid-19. that’s math works.”

First...line...the reddit hive-mind real. husband really wanted us gather 5 family members, stayed firm decision us get together anyone. story shows happens ""it happen us"" mentality. Nope, going risk it. correctional officer first responder? Except businesses shutting down, said quit feel safe.

And right exactly infringed here. Anti vaccine sentiment bad outside hardcore pre-covid antivax crowd.

Man, really hope right. 2020 taught aim expectations low. totally right. say pasteurization works yet seen works *OVER* 156 years? Scientifically, say pasteurization effective process century half. moment now, could change.

/s TLDR study linked results suggest significant public optimism regarding potential value vaccines reducing burden COVID-19 warranted, even vaccines development shown moderately efficacious. surprisingly, vaccine-associated benefits increase greater levels efficacy infection, infectiousness, disease progression, mortality. even vaccines 50% efficacy threshold established June 2020 FDA guidance document could make valuable contributions COVID-19 prevention efficacy COVID-19 vaccines currently studied phase 3 trials soon reviewed FDA, important, one contributor overall effectiveness vaccination programs may eventually part. ultimate success COVID-19 vaccination efforts depend embracing wide range vaccine efficacy profiles time authorization approval, managing expectations regarding vaccine contribute public health responses tandem continued use non-pharmaceutical interventions, investing substantially rapidly efforts rapidly deliver vaccines large portion population possible quickly identify respond sources vaccine hesitancy. strategy would maximize individual population benefits authorized approved COVID-19 vaccines increase likelihood approach high expectations placed upon them. Cruises take months even get ready sail again. sail dates available doesn’t mean it’s going sail. None ships equipped sail yet. Instead they’re giving passengers 125% cruise credit cruise gets canceled, many keeping deposit get extra refund.

As someone waiting cruise industry come back get job back, hurts, sailing happens again. tbh, china's government way better Trump's pandemic. least say hoax suggest people injecting bleach dismiss covid deaths 'almost nothing' skip g20 covid meeting golf. lied covid twice year, trump lies twice day. Governments different imagine US normal president... Post hoc ergo propter hoc. Hospitals overcrowded made early mistakes care, made early mistakes care overcrowded.

About NYC; Cuomo admitted mentioned bad policy reversed May 10th. Though idea free beds critical cases, many care homes indicate could follow proper precautions, agree still bad decision.

Can clearly state trying prove? Forgive confusion. filling bars right now, telling nurses suck quit. Folks drink beer home zoom friends ICU capacity comes back control, vaccines ship. hard ask people listen state legislature actively undermining governor. 

Appeals hedonism winning better natures. hospitals keep filling up. sucks, hope nation get shit together enough help life. Well, good speaking could! Hopefully things improve coworkers! Ugh gross. really think something you.

And... won, thanks playing. wonder would feel doctor watching people die state calling fucking hoax? would feel, Mr ""think feelings""?

Imagine doctor watch someone die Republican. happen. tax cuts defense spending.
Yes... started saying people denied treatment politics.

Imagine someone denied healthcare.. happened healthcare all?? worries, year, getting different licenses. figure NAAAADL (non-automated automated assistant assistant Driver Liscence) we'll get renewal anyways cases hospital? Soooo, 20% people asymptomatic, vaccine also shown reduce symptom severity.... even work? don’t know, maybe listening people like Steven Crowder make think way. can’t cure stupidity. pisses see people proudly posting pictures gyms wearing mask, wearing mask chin wearing useless mouth shields, high end gym city considered joining cause took pandemic seriously would sanitize everyday, force members social distance wear masks keep reposting stories people wearing masks wrong simply wearing probably stopped sanitizing, they're even hosting workout classes masks closed rooms live city private hospitals already 100% capacity.

The gym used go sign saying masks mandatory even staff wearing them. know people do. one else rides car kid, I'll keep fresh one two hanging case need swap one I'm wearing reason. several masks each, always wash laundry, dry hot dryer.


All mask police (who tend wear masks themselves) assuming everyone else crappy hygiene funny. 


The outspoken anti-masker work guy walk restroom stall head straight back work. Bypassing sink. Luckily handle food. Even start allowing employees wear mask memo specifically Associates food prep areas permitted wear masks Herd immunity incoming America soon? Wow. Big step.

But.... people might party home?  getting pretty obvious vaccines safe effective. way social media one person get seriously ill one trials plastered world headline news immediately, take look one person stroke (turned unrelated) another person died (had placebo, unfortunate him). Define 'plenty'.

Melbourne subjected hard lockdown, yet handful denial shitheads - quickly dealt police - turned protests wave moronic placards. think quite reasonable. cut customer interaction time too, unless die. go wayyyy up. one tell beef. /r/InclusoveOR Easy answer. Pork Chops. Thank God overreact virus like Wuhan right? Yes, let’s please encourage panic-buying PPE go another round scarcity. think open degree people actually took right precautions.

People keep saying this, aside specific places, doesn’t appear doable Western world. Every European country fucked, America fucked. Even places good mask compliance (NYC, Boston, lots NJ) spiking moment. It’s virus, it’s going spread “open up.” vaccine relief this, don’t walk line opening things shutting back down. Rural America makes food great plan! Jesus Christ simple Google search would wonders. 

But without even getting that, sense urgency around Covid, Chinese working vaccines way advance whilst sitting thumbs, think tiny bit strange there's practically news reported Western media them?

It's hilariously tragic. 
There's idiots die Covid still believing fake.

And opposite spectrum, there's idiots also die waiting vaccine, convinced Western-made vaccines always superior.

You know, unethical big pharma companies decades trying gut regulations. 

Also, congrats missing point. read another article stated numbers higher two labs Cleveland Cincinnati report couple days...well last days 8000+ cases day regardless numbers terrible.

C'mon Ohio, get shit together stay home. want see family Christmas rate look like cards wife nurse immuniser - 8 percent hardcore vaccine deniers population. Mostly affluent well hardcore disadvantaged populations.

I sure significant cohort people might hesitant susceptible outreach - like disease.

We fine. 🤨 risky masked contact distance someone got 15 days' isolation testing positive? Active r/louderwithcrowder 

now makes sense. Downvote move on. province? Quebec held finally let through. little fanfare even think know anyone wife using it. new year going horrific. Lest start increasing taxes

And instead simply going billionaires make sure loopholes exist anymore Thank detailed explanation. guess time tell vaccinated people still spread virus. fear people don’t get vaccinated think fine majority population vaccinated. linked before, no... UVC reach surface meaningful Well really fit lungs jar, one said sealed. mean basically proven mummies. shady surgeon implant glass around lungs immune!

&amp;#x200B;

Big pharma trying get pay vaccine solution simple along! Man Americans stupid. chance almost visit one lines Central America. wish would have

I wanna know food comes Oh well, get voted often usually deserve it, except one, really trying tell write hundreds thousands shorthand. Yep. Places violate order fined risk liquor license suspended. already well north 20%. 

source? Yes, actually given mechanics virus spreads. think it’s tooth fairy work? Gotta love dumb fuck comments like whose statement ""It's bad, come on."" mean honestly I'd defend anyone goes underground government decided can't make money. already Covid? proof immunity counted? Yes. PA revoke liquor license administrated state level. municipalities revoke business license. could make really difficult ever open back again. I'm excited day rolling vaccines manufacturers' problem - want slice 8 billion people needing vaccines? Better hurry Oxford/Moderna/whoever eats lunch. 

The fact many vaccines looking good enormously reassuring one way another things ramp quickly. Alright cool guess it’s better nothing , probably get 90 percent ones come though respectfully disagree. vaccine properly explained personally decide want it, able to. Kids smarter give credit results take 10 minutes rapid test I’ve got friends 20 years flying jets currently driving SkipTheDishes Uber.


You need get different industry man. know it’s something want hear, reality. People behavior think underestimated discussions. try look clues regulations thinking people act like machines response regulation. 

One shouldn’t forget sociological factor (guilt, shame, fear, feeling duty/responsibility). stage wouldn’t surprised affects spread anything else, degree case would obviously vary societies depending public’s views trust authorities.

When situation turning worse, everyone talking virus. changes behavior. seen anecdotally times situation gets serious starts reversing even though restrictions necessarily imposed explain it. I’d guess that’s fear/shame/responsibility work. Yeah move find new job middle greatest economic depression since 1930's global pandemic, easy sorry guys going this. plain unfair. Good news horrifying news? Selfish fucks. remains statement fact. neither nice nice. simply is. call Melbourne's lockdown 'one' 'short'.

To date Melbourne lockdown around 160 days restrictions around 240 days. yeah. logistically far winner cost wise there's simply comparison.

If get dosage right efficacy around 90% far winner. point ill fitting N95 advantage purchasing something supposedly better can't follow usage instructions, picking user friendly effective item consumer priority. wasting resources buy one fit supply limit means interfere access someone actually would work for. /u/smileedude 

Adenoviruses used vaccination, yes, different strains used different vaccines immunity possible. second booster shot adenovirus different surface proteins first adenovirus vaccine shot. 

The applies vaccines, vaccine uses adenovirus strain lead immunity vaccine working.

Also need two doses vaccines need see cell mediated adaptive immunity ensured second shot, first shot may prime immune system develop full fledged immunity. NZ fair share types showed clear effective consistent communication unite people instead divide them. 

There even ""jacinda virus"" bumper stickers etc. But, overall, majority population got behind gov initiative due respectful consistent message education adressed corners population outlined would buying plan.

This defeatist attitude anti vaxers etc deserve worth effort educate treat respect fuels fire. 1918 Spanish flu H1N1 still circulates today even vaccines. H1N1 caused swine flu pandemic 2009. vaccine weeks away.

***EXACTLY HUNKER FUCK DOWN!*** Given know Covid, possible vaccine help things quicker normal? Here’s thinking: 100 people get covid. vaccinate 10 them. vaccine “kicks in” (for lack better term), 9 people won’t get Covid. importantly, 9 people asymptomatic/presymptomatic spreaders Covid. 

Isn’t huge benefit? Herd immunity would mean essentially eliminating virus altogether. enough people get vaccine continues circulate probable COVID becomes another seasonal flu. article garbage.
 
[Go source information (which presently, there's much nothing yet 
Likely Federal recommendation coupled various State recommendations dictate plan distribution. America truly doomed country. Millions die followed advice president. Truly shameful. sweeping generalization isn’t true across board, go guess! I'm trying argue it, figured person replied mixed type hundreds thousands shorthand trying help future comments.

Again, there's nothing post title comment one replied indicating we're talking daily numbers all. lot places, testing resources starting become scarce high demand. 3 days+ even get test Walgreens/CVS locations point...what’s use?  stops going getting Antibody test independently (outside ethics morals)? I'd probably want know. Personally I'm belief vaccines going effective safe, knew antibodies I'd say ""fuck it"" see going back living ordinary life skipping mask everywhere could. announced optimistic vaccine results. People think get shot oh, March fine. idiots easy spot Oh no! procreate crazy lady? Look TP recreational section. Usually TP RV bought. could also argue almost year pent-up demand industries could see spike demand back pre-COVID levels quickly. ""common sense"" mean thinks Same. feel like don’t excuses. Coworkers kids running around don’t. don’t reason distracted feel like I’ve slowly ground since start pandemic. Maybe it’s I’ve almost entirely isolated since March. I’ll likely isolated end pandemic can’t/won’t travel see parents holidays. Entire populations people areas vote red deserve deprived medical care majority voted red. Providing public health depending group people ""deserve"" based location disgusting. Even determining gets access health care based voted abhorrent.

It's fucking outbreak. need \*everyone\* treated vaccinated. Denying anyone care and/or prevention punishes everyone, republican otherwise.  No, study hope/wish be. think is.

My concerns election come pass clear studies interfered with. would argue premature argue small social gatherings driving lots cases

A lack evidence mean lack cause. that's many people know got it. 

It feels little like ""kids can't get it"" narrative couple months ago, BS absence kid testing data, many kids gotten negative test results. Lo behold, testing ramped up, lots kids found positive

Even examples article imply know anything.  Louisiana 220,000 cases. I'm sure appropriate draw conclusions data, article says clear exposure information paltry 3,300 cases. 

Same Colorado - cite 10,000 known case exposure sources, Colorado nearly 200,000 cases themselves. terribly shocking lots clear-cut data jails nursing homes... people can't leave places, course known exposures. 


I'd argue there's much community spread people know got it, suggests even small multi-household gatherings pretty damn risky.

Might they're primary drivers? course. think anywhere near enough concrete data declare That's I'm hoping... 95% 60% enough life go back normal. feel proven safe

What qualifications able opine subject, may ask? meet people time work social media say believe get vaccinated. hardcore swayed alternative news sources, especially seeing many 911 conspiracy believers there. consensus countries March mask usage. I'm trying simplify best want listen. 

I told stepmother: ""I wish could credibly say provoking God's wrath, certainly provoking wrath health care workers. thanking God well positioned, avoid worst plague century room people live with. That's it. simple. one first non essential workers vaccinated. virus going rip though little church, mark words."" Exactly. Spanish flu huge death toll, spread world, anti-mask movement, yet people forgot it.

 Even words often used describe pandemic, imply pandemics happened before. 

Humans stupid evidently learn little past dont remember past 100 years.

In similar vein, people talking recent troop losses middle east like high. grandfather's generation, survived WW1 Spanish Flu would laugh us.

If lasts 2.5 years, medium sized blip history compared events. spot queue lol FTFY: badly thoroughly TRUMP ~~the CDC~~ sabotaged CDC's ~~its own~~ reputation credibility 2020. Shocking everyone still focused symptoms neglecting asymptomatic transmission.

Doesnt article kind say opposite? says symptomatic spread real infected coronavirus likely pass virus others *in first days symptoms appear*, new research found. 

. . findings line contact tracing studies suggest majority viral transmission events occur early, especially *within first five days symptom onset*, indicating importance self-isolation immediately symptoms start,” said leader researcher Muge Cevik. 

It seems saying symptomatic spread real problem. Dreamcast get smashed. Scored small bird, would plenty happy cooking large one many left overs. mRNA technology vaccine based completely new tested side effects may may appear years later. vaccine first time mRNA used scale. *If* side effects take years develop, know. mRNA many years researched studied need rapid COVID vaccine became basis COVID vaccine development. like watching history books written page page. 

It tempting look certain events throughout history think, ""wow dumb back what,"" feel smug human progress since then. collective inability mildly inconvenience save millions lives one events. &amp;#x200B;

the people immune (regardless efficacy vax).. means there's less chance ""FIVE PERCENT"" even encounter someone who's infected. 

&amp;#x200B;

the flu vax NEVER 40-60% effective.

&amp;#x200B;

even get it.. fact lot people offers degree protection - basically mask.. Entire populations people areas vote red deserve deprived medical care majority voted red. Providing public health depending group people ""deserve"" based location disgusting. Even determining gets access health care based voted abhorrent. 


It's fucking outbreak. need \*everyone\* treated vaccinated. Denying anyone care and/or prevention punishes everyone. first human mRNA vaccine trial rabies vaccine 7 years ago. They're fine afaik. training contact tracing, surprisingly high number people picked cell home phone. Well NSW got result lockdown that. First all, neck tattoo now... 
Secondly, I'm saying he's thin, I'm saying can't tell someone TOFI. Thats fucking point TOFI.

If wanted call chubby, objected. think missing point.  Yeah, got bad enough Labor day Halloween, Thanksgiving going insane. Living bud Want strike first responders. Continue this. No, remembered wrong.

The black lives matter protestors remained outside maskee height activity summer months.

People also staying home ""rioting"" people quarantined due pandemic. US recently undergone extended stage xenophobia nationalism.

When US stage xenophobia? targets change, xenophobia always there. Get ready. wave like NY wave 1.....but everywhere. reads like tag line Jason Statham movie  Evidence? picture shows callous disregard health safety others doesn’t it? intentional act caring?

Hey, go too. found pulse oximeter helps assuage feelings - also tracking hr workout. Get familiar what's normal you, workout 'off' day. Better safe sorry.

But yeah, I'm right you. soon found exercise causing complications younger people underlying conditions, workouts suffered.

Mine also decided go virtual week, although case numbers steadily risen two students Covid (and schedule worked wasn’t exposed, fortunately). starting panic decision many students said missing class travel. One seeing sides family, one side major hot spot, taking 4 flights it!!!

End December going brutal. You’re asshole wanting keep grandma safe healthy. Stand ground respectful. family wants see other. It’s tough situation navigate, advice keep mind sometimes it’s say matters, *way* say it.
Let know would love see it’s safe, can’t wait see next year things better.  Legit can't stuffed going back this. win. must missed something, I'm wrong. Ciao.   dealings US UK/Europe markets, across pond whole different story. Everything's dead quiet; online shopping delivery companies course busy, highstreet retail - honest dying trend anyway - well truly, use topical expression, ventilator. Socialism fails everywhere implemented. Germany, china, Venezuela, quite others. always ends disaster. know costs entire weeks salary buy bag chips Venezuela? China.... even want talk China uses socialist power. People get ""disappeared"" time express difference opinion government. actual Nazi style concentration camps right now. Uighur Muslims China put camps killed. want United States? Um akshully, that's what's happening here. people read article 95% less likely comment people read headline 

/s Even covid always Christmas shopping online. like crowds Considering initial person responded addressed misinformation even stated misinformation could found post, seems like willfully obtuse argue avoid see harms producing. reread comments find misinformation stated. read comment again. Law enforcement.  Yeah, that's really went down. Fucking bonkers. Quit job ASAP tag shame employer social media MERCHANT DEATH. demonize them, people like things bad right now. 👏 👏  really. thinking Mississippi maybe Yeah, surely know covid exponential growth overwhelm hospital system earth, soon morgues overwhelmed.

This kinda easy error make. calmer periods easy argue there's barely hospitalizations, heavy restrictions? exponential growth starts react fast, there's roughly one two weeks lag restrictions hospitalizations. wait till hospitals almost full late.

Still one wonder places knowingly let situation explode. sad number one person.... entire family, groups friends, entire lifelong connections. feel like want angry something. But. Right now, watching causes much sadness. 

It's crazy think basically everyone ever met life going this, too. worry smarter, Christmas going worst lives. chance. Particularly year. like episode Dirk Gently's bridge, one knows hell going on. Simply existing business public spaces without mask “callous disregard”. Personal safety degree still heavily falls individual. absolutely brutal , starting feel irresponsible am, going do? 

If people want take personal risk guess right, sucks dragged along ride.  get glad get mad....and every right control body mind...but, agree approach matters. empathy ultimately follow instinct. getting teeth pulled, getting covid would put sure need done, correct? well...tell double visits asap. Truly. It’s almost like government supposed help people times crisis. even know misinformation talking about. read personal anecdote. Even without covid, feels like normal exercise session several weeks cause muscle soreness another dimension. california passed presumptuous clause workers compensation claims. Employees Covid19 presumed contracted job unless employer prove otherwise. friendly businesses insurance companies least prevents sort situations. Something tells overturned though couple appeals. Holy shit lmao feel like people may understand issues Police military murdering civilians issues riots, it’s damn Irish.   actually said since comment spreading misinformation. saying them. unless side account his, can't actually know that. right. get determine feel.

I sorry feel belittled. sucks. However excuse spreading misinformation ridiculing someone else insulting them. one insulted belittled regardless feels responses. Interesting one authors called ""heartbreaking"" result. Seems fairly intuitive, no? Yup, we’re point growth curve people go: “wow, fuck come from?”  like half million significantly disabled people survived currently it?

Now im downplaying (of course am). I've isolating. luckily seen horror people experienced. There's way they've recognized far. People even go doctor. Shoppers, bout workers? work retail store packed normal year. It’s scary ""they're jobs""

Reminds great line ""Thank smoking."" 

The Yuppie Nuremburg Defense. owner restaurant Los Angeles, can't even fill limited outdoor seating. People staying law staying middle friggin pandemic. Even restrictions lifted business would still eviscerated except pandemic would last way longer lot people would die. Really feel love fellow chicagoans , seriously. Yeah, ton respect good chunk family pandemic (and presidency situation well). pandemic really laid selfish people are, point asked I'm going 2 family reunions next year family gathering Orlando winter, real. ""If time, God take me"" thing say it, grown religion still practice, baffles they'd leave everything chance, especially take account world around us. Lol wut? fine Italian research team, confirmed Italian govt... hey, freedom remain ignorant. Doctors nurses don’t run vents, respiratory therapists do. Canadian department store chain. health system government cranking APNs instead making investment physicians. Crit care APN takes 5-6years (including nursing school) vs board certified critical care MD taking 13+ years. 
Last surge hospital crit care attendings greatest bottle neck, PPE, nurses, ventilators, etc..
Lack proper maintenance long term planning health system really showing pandemic. argument really going ‘my job taking care sick people hard many sick people’? Went looking small turkey chicken quiet Thanksgiving home immediate family, could find nothing, stores insanely crowded. LA suburb. /sigh. \^ whiny child are! Bwah-ha-ha! ""business"" must hotdog pushcart! Ha Ha Ha! I've spent almost every Thanksgiving alone 36 years. Checkmate, Covid! absolutely deplorable reason country needs suffer crash burn United States nothing fucking joke least government wise policy wise foster child threw streets 18 left dead homeless 10 years finally addicted drugs stereotypical things happened people poor finally get barely scraping skin teeth government needs pay pay dearly they've done us. article says it’s people coming home thanksgiving I've seen too! That, old ""let take mask talk phone"" ""let take mask hear me"". 

Do people really understand entire point mask?? God hate living Texas. I'm sorry dumb. job can't done home, risk getting sick matter precautions take. insistence people like making changes lifestyle killing thousands daily. amount rationalizing changes that.  Context matters. Herd immunity vaccination always happy path, never changed. Herd immunity letting virus rip population still fucking stupid. Unfortunately, ""enough Americans"" + antivaxxers 100% Yes hospitals take care people get sick. are, people getting sick. Stop whining job. quit. Way fucking selfish idiot. People always complain wanting get away people. year it. time read books find yo inna peace y'all! ron desantis fascist sack shit. risks weighed unknown risks COVID? seems strange spend pregnancy told worry like, microwaving avoiding lunch meats like, there's new pandemic pregnancy general considered worth precautions (at least considered good enough reason get accommodation teach online). saw updated CDC list conditions later labeled higher risk workplaces already used earlier list decide get safer position. can't get vaccine dangerous work public anyway risk else lose health insurance right giving birth... get could risks vaccine that'd frustrating even option. Grateful done pregnancy point. fuck religious rambling? You’re writing irrelevant nonsense me, Jesus Christ. course, retail workers taking (or made take risks too). compare retail work optional family visit extended family disingenuous. Interesting. Part.of me.womders would enough? could vaccine 2x many people.

I know virus never going away see becoming far less deadly bear future people exposed it. Evil Another embarrassment entire fiasco. said still going work. everything right want - wear mask, wash hands, stay six feet away people - working indoors enclosed space people 8+ hours day still chance catching airborne virus. sucks. Anyone else gonna chill home kill grandparents? It’s option, let’s honest, nobody putting gun head.

They said, first option safer, end sick, won’t meet couples that. It’s really big deal grand scheme things. Let’s move Thanksgiving June call good.  Would anyone actually oppose that? America really land selfish, ignorant misinformed. insane think would ok right now. -Chronicled Princess Urinal almost American people *trying* get infected...?

The rest world understand logic yank 2020. Madness. full support terms went through, I'm going put domestic violence much gendered crime. 75% victims women 90% abusers male. someone tells abusive experience, 9 times 10 abuser man. make anyone's experience less difficult, let's pretend abuse completely random. That'd fucking great.

IF killed themselves, there'd far less boaters terrible people destroying coast coral reefs remain keys. It’s Florida I'd wager 1.5% tested positive less likely flying (due sick enough want to/cant fly, actually caring spread), even though I'm sure number also zero. Yup. fact ive used Healthcare France England used live growing up.

But live USA, get deal bullshit here. Evil acting like you’re pro-life you’re dumbass hypocrite Yep, try look hopefully people love things. let chips fall Thanksgiving around corner, people get together someone else house indoor. necessarily. Infectious Disease doctor hospital got it. How? Constant exposure even mask safety precautions available. Also, check people said non-Covid, turned positive. Poor guy even go stores, work home. mild case recovered.
The chance getting right things still work outside home, kids going school.  China reported 3 domestic cases today, vs 200,000 US. US health agencies still denying coronavirus transmission cold chain logistics possible, despite evidence China Singapore. 

But I'm sure right workers got infected simply big dumb-dumbs forgot wash hands like you. people expect? We. Warned. You. I’m tired hearing patients. known serious months. **listen.** regret means nothing me. Never underestimate people’s stupidity. head TGA (our equivalent FDA) said recently, that's Skerritt said hoped vaccines would approved early January, first jabs administered Minister Greg Hunt said hoped entire population would able immunised end next want see Australians option vaccinated course 2021, distribution process set achieve Skerritt said Australians waiting COVID-19 vaccination would also allowed jump queue willing healthcare workers vulnerable would offered jab first doses secured Government, Professor Skerritt said nothing stopping medical companies selling additional vaccine live free market economy,"" nothing stopping companies long TGA approval put vaccine market Honestly , subreddit filthy. Florida pretty good.  I’m one outgoing, extroverted, social people ever.... guess what’s important need hangout friends family? Public health global crisis.

I text, call, FaceTime people. online therapy. get outside. don’t put peoples lives risk miss friends. fucking sucks, it’s need get side this. I’m sacrificing country. wish people would Game on. Wow, looks animal cruelty biting us ass again. Shocker. ""Freedman points flight length might impacted masking: ""It would really hard people keep masks entire 18 hours.""

People actively avoiding infection. honestly idea Covid vaccines. occured writing.

My guess, would similar finishing anti-biotics. It'd less effective, grant long term immunity and/or worst case, act training ground virus evolve around vaccine weakening killing it. thought China started reporting 0 daily cases back April?

China doesn’t need democracy big brother... mean communist party knows best!

In fact don’t need democracy look it’s gotten us, also don’t need freedom speech either I'm vaccine expert understanding point vaccine introduces antigen (foreign virus) body body's natural immune system make antibodies virus. way, exposed virus, already antibodies needed fight it. 

The second booster shot would reinforce memory, extend effectiveness vaccine. push people getting together someone house friends actually matter? Makes upset I’m early 20s boring. Yeah Trump ignores altogether. leader. I'm honestly afraid move now. Americans sound like monsters. Thank answer. work rehab care worked hospital setting three-month rotation. worked year PRN nursing homes started. taken break working pandemic hit. I’ve signed state’s medical reserve corp I’m trying wrap mind around exactly happens patients they’re triaged. read book years back happened certain New Orleans hospital lost support, involved triaging also accusations mercy killing (no one prosecuted). imagine like same, it’s natural disaster localized one area. hospital help eventually came people airlifted out. isn’t going happen pandemic.

Keep informed: [CDC Hospital Reporting Forgive don’t excuse thousands individuals jet setting across country haven’t left house 9 months still going get worse gets better.

I agree that. Saying hospitals going ""collapse"" within weeks fear mongering. I've never said anything anti science lol Lol risk life see NFC East team play. Baltimore Ravens too. Mid December: ""We idea numbers high.""

Late December: ""What? course we're celebrating Christmas.""

After Christmas: ""New Years totally on, bro.""

Mid January: ""Nobody could foresee COVID catastrophe life-saving vaccines close."" Agreed. biggest concern would whether everyone truly access vaccine. already know struggles get vaccine rural areas, especially either two cold-storage vaccines ones go market first. Lower income clinics might also trouble accessing storing enough vaccines help local populations. long properly address concerns, I’d feel comfortable financial incentive. also think get another stimulus check anyway even then. something called vaccine reactivity makes disease worse, seen yet COVID new vaccines, something watch for.

It also design requirement 50% effective, actually 95% effective. 

Imho, said done, turn vaccine reduce spread, too.  What’s going benefit they’re dead? Done👌🏻 Lol what?  lost “Operation Warp Speed”. Lot trolls today, jeez. Lots Ventilators

you sure? say ok It’s honestly guess. I’m thinking logistics everyone getting it/enough agreeing get it. 5 month difference conservative. depends it’s distributed. Name doc? soon get Canada, will. people wait year there's least vaccine this?    state disgusting. really shows state sub user getting downvoted speaking facts time admit country care one bit working class. treated like beasts burden, human beings, capitalist class everything get away every turn extract wealth opportunity rest us.

How much willing take, America? equally good. would wear surgical mask everyday stuff. Save KN95 go hospital, crowded areas, seeing/taking care covid patients.

Some people love lolling around luxury petri dish. healthcare system completely collapses... season closer Last Week Tonight, John Oliver says something course next several months depend highly key factors. least willing kind work together fix issues.

We watching UK cooking show previous remarked judges frankly really nice. Sure, still judging, decent people versus usual reality show stuff. general UK offerings better US, even given seemed much ""We've rough year, let's see humane help; we're together"".

Then saw Oliver bit, considered country we're living &amp; said ""uh, yeah, that...""  really lunacy. case loads hospitals fraction see next month. people hospital likely got infected October numbers less half now. 

Even vaccine can't treat everyone short amount time. sick, vaccine help. 

It's still going get worse gets better. virus survive frozen food packaging, mean outdoor surfaces (bus stop shelters, exterior door handles, outdoor ATMs) winter months? state bro, I’m native. didn’t vote him.

Well, okay then. /s Right? It’s unreal. Yet we’re simultaneously experiencing modern science marvel politicization country caused masks become topic can’t even go thanksgiving Christmas safely. know logical answer irrational anxious part thinks test got lost 😩 Nah would better archived end pandemic. Meme subs horrible. serious doubts get approved US. IDK situation EU. AZ stock slid 2% announcement data. don’t fly. I’ve asked long time ago, curious anyone knows info there. gym requires masks throughout class everyone pretty good wearing - time pulled drink water. Everyone 6’ apart well. don’t doors windows open, air isn’t stagnant I’m guessing air cycled reasonable well. class usually 45 people, they’re like 12 total. temperature checks symptom self reporting door. classes, use fogger disinfect everything spray equipment heavy duty disinfectant. feel somewhat safe going frankly, put like 10 lbs closed I’ve finally shed of. 

Long story short - anyone heard reasonably well mask-required gyms terms safety? haven’t able find good information that. think started researching 'two full doses' group statistics part 'headline' results whole research project.

I imagine they'll recommend 90% efficacy regimen based research. suspect ""I'm antivax, trust Trump administration"" group come around firm ""I'll absolutely get it"" side again.

If something rushed election, I'd still firmly crowd would've waited Canadian European approval. since everything thusfar announced election, sign up. actually British don’t think Warp speed anything Full think, originally enough 2m people. Could wrong though Pontius Pilate summons hero...

Though bad rest US right now, even we're relaxing much responding slowly current rise. Start fining people doesn’t follow mask mandate lol . Money maker Italy , probably won’t happen USA though county (Summit, CO), sends patients Denver. reason 9100ft altitude, Denver 5280. want patients lower elevation. precisely, republican governments rural voters elected removed financial support rural hospitals allowed free market thing, resulting shutdown thousands unprofitable rural hospitals served communities. I'll leave figure mistake. ""Conspiracy theorists"" question theories tend accept incredibly improbable things facts.

I think accuse employing socratic method. ""questioning"" highly selective. Exactly. Like would love first I'm healthcare worker/first responder I'm 20s close last line. thing going essential worker (but one front lines like nurses). said could. Exactly giving Trump people types powers wouldn’t perfect scenario whatsoever really wonder why. think early users doom gloom type set tone?

Obviously shit FUCKING SERIOUS still able celebrate wins. ""Everyone problems right now, count. Stop complaining."" - boss 2 hours quit. Wow, saw last night someone (regular person, media) posted video. lot conjecture fake news meant scare people. Guess not. It’s available century.

Even every year, anyway flu shot getting second shot big deal.

The economic impact virus whole separate issue. never denied covid seriously wrecked economy. IRA, tax break middle-class. can't afford save money, fuck you, sayeth government covid moves in, covid moves out, one explain it

it possibly people take preventive measures actually helps prevent stuff happening. I'm happy you, choice. Many people poorer countries able to.

Yes! understand everyone acting like terrible thing! hate seeing family holidays, hate feeling guilty I've chosen to. ban dancing well? Ahhhh!!!! 🤯 degraded, might fight rights. psychological humiliation part system would think, local mall announced Santa year. Absolutely. AZ little bit interesting situation. sample size half dose regimen much smaller. 90% chance due smaller sample size actually working better? AZ pivot focus half dose regimen, thus extending trial? Probably results looking for. massive improvement risk population vaccinated. 100% agree you. 

But have, begrudgingly, remember everybody lives extremely different lives me. start realize scenarios travel unavoidable.

As example, participating tax program Puerto Rico. I’m required tax law Puerto Rico 183 days year. imagine happy I’ve I’ve literally forced get plane go Puerto Rico, come back home, traveling twice pandemic. 😫

Most recently five days ago. currently waiting see got sick. 

But also educate myself. don’t partake food drink service. near literally nobody I’m airport, ever. bought seat next I’m sitting next anyone. wear medical grade N95 mask don’t remove ever touch face.

I hope precautions work. I’m also fairly certain everybody items listed above, would transmissions virus planes. I’m protect stupid people wear shitty useless masks order drinks plane. explained me: body might wiping initial chimp virus fast learn anything useful fight covid thinks chimp virus bigger problem. shut non essential stores Quebec. streets literally empty first wave. People even afraid go grocery store. Must've unwillingly forcefully expelled cloud aerosolized particles, alongside obvious. wondering North America implement COVID response like China, locking 17,000 people get tested would break whole host laws likely would considered human/constitutional rights violation. That’s going do. Thanksgiving April. Poland suddenly looking better: US equivalent numbers deaths 11/21 4,994(very bad) 2871 yesterday 1357 today That’s thinking. Trump would come claim meant Easter 2021 start. 😒 still incredible. IMO headline downplays efficacy since two different dosing options. 90% half full strategy right line Pfizer Moderna vaccines! Yes, NY pretty well poorly beginning. Reminds Sweden. I'm still gonna pretend like countries currently getting hammered learned lessons. USA, including NY, Europe horribly ones well usual suspects Australia, New Zealand, Vietnam, S. Korea etc. Hope jinxed lol. legal, known I’ve saying whole time. &lt;rhymes dump preaching muh freedumbs... normal Easter

Well, guess Trump right all. vaccine lower efficacy work harder vaccinate people. 

I predict US least Pfizer Moderna vaccines first choice AZ distant 3rd. that’s AZ vaccine even gets approved open question. Many analysts serious doubts get approved US AZ stock slid 2% release data. probably learn lot friends treat pandemic mad China got handle virus US?

No need spread lies. first time 300 days, Victoria active coronavirus cases state’s hospitals completely COVID-19 first time Victoria coronavirus patient hospital since February 21.

Wow amazing. proud Victoria Australia vaccines require one dose. Rotavirus, Hep B, Diphteria, Pertussis, Tetanus, Polio, Influenza, Measels, Mumps, Rubella Pneumoccus require multiple shots (usually three) additionally need renewed every year. three initial injections happen early childhood, usually 4-18 months age.

I would honestly surprised, vaccine would required one injection. good sceptical, many things seem much less weird, one information put perspective. look Sweden June-October almost lockdown policy. alert: exact curve NY.

Could big reason curve went down, COVID-19 SEASONAL disease?

No, CAN'T be. reason Covid went June DE BLASIO punched out. That's part blows mind. can't 1 country hoax. Every country world basically every doctor+nurse **everywhere** lying virus. *ever* history global conspiracy EVERY government planet agreed something. Give fucking break. Nevermind logic preceding whole thing, would every country want tank economies? ""Because want control people"" 

Can't handle man Surely prioritize children? thought “the rules” worked rationing care. yet rural voters national public healthcare system. work rural county zero ICU beds.

I know surrounding cities 99% full. 

The day sick patient needs transfer, there's bed them... Well, much could death sentence person. applies postal service, too. handle well, suddenly second wave hit worse, Greece yesterday reported 103 deaths, that's equal 3,275 deaths US Thanksgiving, Christmas, don’t statewide mask mandate, etc. 

We’ve hit 4k cases day (based test administered) last Monday. crunch numbers alongside Dchapman77 seeing case counts % positive growing exponentially right signs slowing. peak summer maxed 5,450 case ~22% positive. We’re ~17% positive right close 5k cases/day week. difference summer counties put mask mandate place (albeit without teeth) curbed spread initially. people tired covid want gathering small groups friends family, letting guard around people trust. summer traveling nurses come help sent patients New Mexico treatment. don’t luxury time around. DChapman77 also tell numbers wise hospital bed counts worse peak. taylor ham, let fools tell otherwise.  half-sister called psycho go wedding fall. Yeah, wedding 100 people masks pandemic.

Wonder implication J&amp;J vaccine, uses similar technology? seem think work one dose, main Phase 3 study using lowest dose tested Phase 2. also started second Phase 3 looking 2-dose regimen, can't find details actual dose sizes. I'd problem per se - happens country rolls vaccination scheme without internationally recognized certification go it? beat virus,we still left country full people said really fucked shit. can’t ignore problems anymore...we need counseling Also, 4 people could infected airport prior flight. guessing. 

There way reliably tell someone infected/infectious, we’ve known since like January. immunity, guess I'll die then.

This guy either troll complete moron. [archive link anyone trouble accessing article can’t , legally, physically short handed. Oh well, may can, curious, report data process leads 90% efficacy? promote two full doses giving 62%, could say half + full = 90%?

Is transparency conducted study? sounds like none 3 preventing spread virus? wonder polls studies widespread anti-vaccine thought really is? know tend vocal, would imagine would key part public health policy; percentage given population would reject vaccine? 

I'm sure regional variants, one would need account depth/strength anti-vax feelings. US, we've seen local breakouts (I believe) measles years ago, attributed anti-vax delusion.

I suspect live ""hot-spot"" mindset, I'd love know sure. I've thinking lot different responses different countries. 

The difference social technical responses. 

I fear many US future respond ""no worries, american exceptionalism create vaccine thin air quickly, need quarantine/change behavior"" rather recognize much need both, anything specifically american, thin air, vaccines come Step 1: get team gay ready

Step 2: get people wear masks

Step 3: murder children

Can't that, we? (Note: post simply like put predictions look back later. welcome discussion please downvote simply disagree.)

So smaller states (Dakotas, Iowa, Wisconsin) started downward trajectory big ones (particularly California) still rise. knows testing delays impact week's data suspect we're going find country's testing capacity near maxed people getting tested Thanksgiving. best guess right we'll hit close 3 million tests. Maybe 7-day average, think there'll least day two many. 

So let's say 7-day average 2.6 million tests. I'll assume positivity rate 8.5%. (The current C19 Tracking Project average 9.8%, rising sample pool going include lot people ordinarily get tested). would put case number 221,000. 8% positive rate would 208,000, 9% would 234,000. high end testing prediction would 3 million. 9% positivity rate would 270,000. Low end, 2.3 million 8% positivity = 184,000.

So best guesses 7-day averages look like around December 1-3. Low end: 184k. High end: 270k. likely around 221k. 

Then question becomes much Thanksgiving spread changes numbers, we'll start see around December 11-15. want vaccine one question. got exposed vaccination visit, would vaccine protect you? we’re averaging based weight, lot notches belt, boys really puts perspective thank you. I've heard too. Apparently cheaper live cruise ships full time pay live retirement home.

I looked verify this, given incentives loyalty discounts cruise companies give frequent passengers, easily believe it.

Other benefits include constantly changing scenery, endless mindless entertainment, wide choice food, etc. One serious downside course inability landlocked family friends visit. Yep, except think technically lying. probably think they've safe. learned one thing this: people think safe actually idiots. 

It's dumbass anti mask people find frightening. morons ""do everything right"" walking petri dishes. saw great example three weeks ago getting curbside groceries: woman pulls mask immediately walking grocery store, touches carriage, itches nose eyes. obviously know this, imagine probably talks safe being. Also, adults bringing unmasked children store. mean, children immune right?

Holy hell I'm freaking sick this. Sad it’s 7 months later kind posts news. know it’s talked nutrition supplementation mainstream media vaccines coming results around time? idea talking about. Truly asking, bit early declare safe given sample size, phase 3 trial 5% normally testing duration? Got proof that? they’re children you’re walking outside, assume lot risks liabilities since care.

I know that’s terrible say work children lots insurance liability issues even yeah walk woods could issue professional. also assume isn’t isolated enough child patient wouldn’t feel comfortable talking loud much super isolated don’t parents would comfortable sending child there. hope daughter family reunite soon, health issues. know feel, it’s scary. Wishing great outcome! guess high limit people used stay lot sun prolly made lot vit awesome!  convincing aguments imo - whatever complication rate vaccine, expect better death rate full covid.     
Have weight two up. Imo 5 years we're risk unknowlingly developing cancer catching covid immunosupressed... would bank maintaining flat 99.998 5 years. I'm trying say bars great concern grand scheme. money wasted spent stimulus, could paid care workers million dollars remain care homes 4 6 months needed ride out. lockdown measures closing bars, schools restaurants blunt approach nuanced problem, using broadsword instead scalpel. 40 50% deaths places like NY, NJ Chicago area occurred care homes. one knows long-term effects shutting schools hospitality industry have, though Puritan instincts always us condemn pubs people frequent them. take one right now. gotta convince liberal hospitals stealing souls aren’t allowed back community July. agencies tried outbreaks. Aka outdoor sessions clients got greedy expanded office. It’s also eye eye contact stops opening up. I’ve adapted roblox sessions use work communication online safety skills asking 95% effective better 70% effective? claiming vaccine effective. claiming true effectiveness half dose + full dose regime could much lower 90% figure widely circulated british media. could case true value low 70% effective. example 30 cases v 1 case best estimate would 97% could low 90% high tiny sample size Mine 22 ng/mL 2017 started taking 5000 IU per day I'm 86 ng/mL limiting factor necessarily ICU beds, staff ICU beds. state field hospital people need oxygen even took get going one run it. 


When there's localized problem solution travel nurses that's tough country. feel like government works, big words scare tactics. know compensated don’t give it. likely government knows owe you, never make easy. Serious question: know unsubscribe sub? *...(Joe rolling blunt).....They combine Vitamin DMT give everyone VitaminDmt shot.*.  


(Guest) Okay talking grandma concentration camp know people voting you, want see happen look huge post Thanksgiving spike numbers Canada since Thanksgiving.  exact masks I've using CDCS website article warning masks NIOSH approved, got little concerned. **Global** study, hmm people wont like remember April people speculating whether could even vaccine it’s never done coronavirus before, three they’re effective. get choice I’d go Moderna one, seems effective least amount issues (95% cold storage required). 
 
Truly remarkable despite pushback refuse informed, science always wins. Manufacturing AZ vaccine started back summer. s’joke would mean virus far less dangerous currently think. Somebody r/dataisbeautiful made graphic: someone gets insurance authorization hospital-to-hospital transfers, true transfer requires doctor calling accepting hospital get accepting physician bed number. can’t transfer patient full hospital; don’t send ambulance patient away hospital blindly find hospital take them... people hundreds thousands cases per day statistically that's still lot people dead, something like 250k 9 months see true commodian... Post Thanksgiving going nightmare. take C, Zinc. Canada 40 million regimes order three announced vaccines, expectation least million doses January.

Nobody expecting first three vaccines effective. PM announced last week Canada looking spring relief, 2022.

This doesn’t include 4 vaccines Canada order options 3 current vaccines Canada exercise.

Canada fine. Couple sources anyone No. Read it. even translated two full doses left effective half dose followed full dose? !RemindMe 10 years Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* lots stupid people either misunderstand purpose masks somehow think liberal / conservative conspiracy. also lack education / common sense ""bubble"" means-- despite analogy perfect (e.g. people talking ""patching"" bubble multiple bubbles makes sense all). leaders urge people stay home plenty people care. Every time leader opens mouth there's army shit-for-brains cry foul. 

In short, Dunning-Kruger action everywhere look. believe Pfizer started trials recently course theyre close completed. work ICU? nurses country dealing reduced hours pay. There’s hospital verge “overload” short time periods never sustained. I’m nurse I’m teacher virtue signaling hilarious point porn stars likely able work right now. imagine much fewer working, porn industry surely filming (hopefully precautions). said “protesting” “celebrating Biden”. virus able detect political values skips believe correct things. life worthless? ok strip others business/employment, ability move freely personal life enjoyment? completely skipped everything else wrote state agenda. Where's compassion rest us? show 15% figure taken from? family thought good idea hold gathering 10 people. far nobody's infected (gotta wait 12 days see though, said gathering two days ago), right we're trying talk holding even bigger Christmas Eve one. briefly due weird rules many flights airlines make order keep slots various airports. rules relaxed number flights dropped considerably.

Anyway, situation sucks both, US Europe. vaccines horizon gives reason screw completely truly available. wish luck, friend. infuriating read. Sign already old codger! Yep, wrong. point, treat Americans like bunch entitled people. know treat differently make sure communities same.

Do want, leave fuck alone. I’ll return favor.  ...flying petri dishes... key ending lockdowns restrictions gets dropped laps 95% efficiency people refuse take it.

The idiocy country know bounds. Would air purifiers impact all? I'm really sure. moved Florida North. I’ll probably wait 3-6 months (assuming I’ll even access then) see data efficacy safety much larger group receives it. That’s enough make feel comfortable. Especially efficacy numbers Unfortunately, problems matter - you. matter boss, many positions leadership equipped deal inrush many problems many reports last year.
 
So statement rude, may bit seems first glance. (Absent negative historical interactions shared time reading comment.) You’re retarded enrolled AZD vaccine trial US got first shot Thursday full dose (disclaimer may gotten placebo), experience taken account theory full/full regime may less effective.

I don’t know exactly designed vector, late thirties never stronger reaction vaccine (tetanus included) entire life. I’m talking full blown fever two straight days, almost passing twice due low blood pressure, horrible headache, teeth smashing chills, barely able move arm looks like taken hulk transformation basically commission two days. 

There something vector use caused innate immune system call bloody murder. honest I’d doubt anything left vaccine create immunity onslaught.

If look phase 2 tolerance paper earlier looks like reaction age dependent older volunteers show strong reaction... doubt full/full ends chosen dosage. article. Go read it... source. basically already record level hospitalizations charts levels within 2 weeks. Awesome. Burying Grandma Christmas going gift family year many science deniers. Thanks. read that. article OP? get worried stressed this. Headlines positive tests ages recovery headlines isn’t norm. It’s possible could happen you. also probable clear present negative result. Would make sense comply request negative test (to show good faith), address remains positive well symptom free? Higher anticipated still like 60% last year Bonus points person playing cowbell wearing reaper costume. first time seeing idea. sure feels like fringe idea.

Now, certain practices should/can encouraged course, like masking sick washing hands properly, think large number people suggesting physically distance 2m lockdown winters perpetuity. stats link literally show men die every age group except 80, presumably much fewer males age group. 

The least lucky (in terms total amount deaths) 60-69 males. focus women men hit harder? Yea thank you! thought saved post there.

Air flow laterally airplane, mostly vertically. simulations describe effect may want look into. Dead man walking. that, people keep saying hospitals ‘empty’. ‘ER’ tent. 4 non-Covid rooms actual ER. Everyone else inside Covid patient waiting room, hard get, even making one person rooms two person rooms. 10:1 patient:nurse ratio. required get doc’s note sick Covid work. it’s mild-moderate Covid, must work. hospital nearby, they’re using basement parking garage. 

But ‘hospitals empty, it’s hoax.’ enough people traditional anti-vaxxers may distrustful surprising political angle related it. Biden, Harris, Gov. Cuomo, top democrats railed covid vaccines implied, without evidence, probably unsafe Trump president developed. Millions probably never get vaccines that, millions otherwise reasonable generally anti-vax. Good safety effectiveness data bring back board. months self observation others took it.

what think trials also depends long immunity vector virus (i.e. permanent one might use vector years)? Exactly. talking man who, even skyrocketing cases across country hospitals overwhelmed they're start talking seriously rationing care, decided skip pandemic session G20 conference go play golf instead. 

Fact is, knows response whole thing criminally incompetent, knows since lost election, people going start actually calling face. ^

I used go least week, sometimes more. may literally cry first time I'm back movie theater lol fall camp well. I’m young, I’ll survive likely, sure body may take bit recover, eventually likely I’ll adjust. Spreading concern, risk vaccinated I’ll feel lot better. would efficacy 28% lower first dosage 50% LOWER?  keep thinking posts summer people chanting ""We NEVER created vaccine coronavirus!"" ""We NEVER created vaccine less 5 years!"" they? consider candidate vaccines didn’t make phase 3 vaccines?

My point drug companies won’t even submit application doesn’t pass testing. Therefore, expect vaccines put submission effective. Ozone insufflation tested pregnant women found different applications got rid virus TOXOPLASMOSIS. tested SARS, obviously probably wildly different state state regardless federal guidelines. understand point, really problem self-destructive rural people *in general*. Generalizing never 100% fair, let us talk problems manageable way. Whether like trading education economic future youth additional years life elderly. Depending outlook either worth since need qualification doubt something

I'm saying think he's wrong anyway I'm saying need rich dude's opinion vaccine instead scientist's Huh weird become worldwide outbreak Italy

But Wuhan, China

Those pesky facts help shilling, they? I'm doubting you, source? (For no. 2) need use arguing point lol Nobody wants hear bullshit man lied us March. Yes, get telling entire nation masks effictive helped ppe supply chains first responders. think lying shitbag shut fuck up. Honestly think half country fucking denial. Sometimes seems really hard people accept that, yes, living terrible global pandemic actual disaster. People got fucking comfortable, felt safe. Accepting global pandemic happen kind rubs lot people wrong way.

A lot things still go wrong modern nation think people accept legitimate dangers control. Fuck, I've even heard bullshit liberal relatives initially refused believe pandemic ""bad"", thought overreacting, might wear mask everyone else want social distance, thought life would go back normal month. emailed brother multiple times trying explain March shit serious thought doom gloom. No, stay safe careful lot people going die country prepared this, can't pump cure month. might little bit board still think optimism unhealthy dose denial, months claiming fearmongering.

People like feel safe refuse believe world still dangerous. think coping mechanism, ignore shit control pretend is. extreme side, get people walking around refusing believe it, dying ICU still refusing. worked last minute, stop denying? final moment, denying fails keep alive, can't learn mistake.  work governance must create policy covers risk. literally put establishments reputation line. got

Basically explained impossible eradicate smallpox methods anti vaccine people tend advocate- hygiene, proper diet, economic improvement, etc. basically none applies India. made open idea vaccination actually work save lives.

Then explained mRNA vaccine technology works, there’s virus mRNA molecules actually degrade short time thing left body plans destroy spike protein. Essentially might safest vaccine tech ever created.

Finally explained don’t use vaccine this, stuck alternating lockdowns roughly 70 percent population it, kill millions USA. 

I didn’t push traditional vaccines don’t care doesn’t get shingles vaccine, personally. framing covid vaccine way protect vulnerable explaining worked it. 

Of course, already believed Covid threat hoax, wouldn’t bothered didn’t least baseline understanding. people know think it’s big deal impossible. going case everywhere. wave like previous waves occurring cities others. made easier move patients around. Now, hospitals filling everywhere disease waning anywhere.  Eventually, nowhere left put patients. Well know hope catches corona thread. ❤️ Also Oxford appears 90% effective half dose/ full dose routine. remember mink farm thing? Hope foreshadowing... Damn. whole neighborhood sucks. *laughs Pfizer* tens thousands (possibly hundreds thousands i'm lazy add totals every vaccine study) members general population already received vaccines  Wtf, recommend 400 IU day one bought, take 1000 IU day anyway, know could go much higher. see large families Utah getting together many pre holiday events well course, Christmas. ""waaaagh suck arguing can't respond"" I'm layman, understand mRNA vaccines specifically? Sounds like concern vaccine? US least put money project warp speed, maybe goes well people see benefits. also Sinovac's vaccine. Sinovac chinese company Reddit cover lot, extremely important developing countries.

It's currently Phase 3 probably 90-95% efficacy well.

And people worried it, tests done around world, China. Pfizer submit interem data like 2 weeks applying approval? sympathy. Everytime major hurricane, told exact hour hit. told evacuate over.

Many kids.

Daily, 16k people die starvation actually. dont see white knights complaining easily preventable deaths. 

What care deaths, seeing headline comfort home inability people see missing social activities upsetting astounding. really miss going bars friends get called alcoholic understand that, plenty idiots everywhere, even Germany tons (I know bc work them), presume stupids always can't understand Canada well summer things started getting worse September. Something happened sudden influx dumdums spreading Covid. outdoor venue one cars drive into? BOC shows normal places people watch cars. Kind like drive theater. sure that's case here? kind attitude keeps pandemic going. got 90% twice there. think meant one 62%. Something keep mind soon vaccine circulation couple months many companies schools probably start requiring vaccines forcing people may reluctant unwilling receive it. Similar vaccines. isn’t bad number start especially considering many probably get it’s while. say bodies immune system reject/fight much...or something along lines. 1:10. impossible give good care. Regardless reality, people around keep saying hospitals empty. free point errors

not really error, nitpicking 2.5 R crazy high. UK lockdown avoid going 1.3. percentage population (accounting meeical staff old people first) probably even lower Oxford vaccine might good Pfizer. 70% score average two regimen doses Oxford experimented with. One gives 90% 64%. Exactly, significant takeaway - offer sterilizing immunity / completely halt transmission get COVID sniffles, that's really huge concern. also widely produced vaccine go countries huge populations like India etc., crucial get borders open again. tried two dosing regimes, one comes 90% 62%. Weighted average 70%. 

Astounding. product sufficiently effective safe easy manufacture distribute. beginning end. politics allowed even though politics killing us. 4m doses already ready UK Covid-19 numbers showed enough people. Hopefully, things start changing gets much worse. last three Monday mornings full great news. I'm starting like Mondays. also state clear case?

Which makes pretty random arbitrary thing roll right - sciencey all. Yes get many people vaccinated possible. I'm excited get grief Christmas going vacation skipping large family Xmas get together again.

They canceled guilt trips anything I'm never around holiday anymore. 

At least one thing look forward winter. I'm hard reset 🥉 Currently area implementation small cases still single digits (Beijing, Kashgar, etc. previously implemented I'm talking about, soon number cases exceeds 100 basically implement citywide).

&amp;#x200B;

The official line is

""Personnel risk areas COVID-19 Tianjin, leave unless required.

If leave (including ill cannot treated within area, move across region routine school work, etc.), bring 7-day negative nucleic acid test certificate. take public transportation traveling.

&amp;#x200B;

Whether people low-risk areas Tianjin need nucleic acid test certificate go abroad depends control measures destination, recommended consult CDC destination phone specific control measures traveling.""

&amp;#x200B;

Personal addition: destination cities (Xi'an) require nucleic acid testing personnel Tianjin, Shanghai, Inner Mongolia, cities may follow suit!

&amp;#x200B;

Tianjin Binhai New Area already conducting full-scale nucleic acid testing. think anti-vaxxers could convinced peer reviewed papers studies, way trusting humans me. 

Their every argument starts conclusion ""vaccines bad"". know ""beat documentation"". Stress it. sign gastro esophageal reflux too. heartburn? agree, sadly. birthday April don’t think I’ll able celebrate big way. said, I’m really excited happiness side thing. We’re going roaring 2020’s can’t wait. Apparently Americans okay this, sight mind mentality. feel like media/gov need blasting images social media/tv like US goes war. 

Of course doctors nurses want blamed making decision grandma die got diabetes heart condition probably wont survive covid, Americans need see images take pandemic seriously. read wrote? There's need go full socialist fix shit. mean anything anymore. 

A single death tragedy; million deaths statistic. Ah, anti-vax stupidity even started yet.

As long family good - get coming them. Sorry healthcare workers gotta deal them, way want it. try turning again? never worn masks implemented lockdowns thousand people die every year flu fhe US? Japan tests 20,000 30,000 people day, upon average. Japan population 1/3 US (about 126 million). Yet test maybe 1/100 amount people US tests. insufficient actually test trace. playing dangerous game. really. Dinner 11.6 

He still hasnt tested positive wait...it changed. There's snippets online Getty son good friends Newsom awhile long ago, give point previous decade, related women. Sterilizing immunity course goal strongly suspect second batch vaccines manufacturers get us there. first set results - 70% upwards several 90% remarkable lead return normalcy besides countries frankly might overdoing terms border restrictions etc. vulnerable populations vaccines, risks community transmission really merit strong measures. Length immunity would also appear bit non-issue based recent studies. honest things mind staying outbreak superseded, larger part population washing hands regarly, confidence working home sick I'm fan face masks crowed public transport. said I'm desperate able return world I'm anxious meet parents fear might get seriously ill world get nice pub day.... free. need vaccines produced get around world. Given quickest vaccine ever developed german measles took 5 years..

Most vaccines developed provide robust immune response minimal side effects. That's part hard. part takes years. Tuning immune response.

These covid vaccines effective many saying aftereffects shot like hangover. reason planning staggered vaccinations household.

So yeah 10 years get vaccine mild side effects flu shot... 1 year feel like spent night drinking.... average score two regimens . first one gives score 90 second one 64 Ohhh it’ll fun! Like Twilight, argue got better vaccine... “I got Moderna, so...” there's nearly zero chance mutating vaccine released (assuming ones news successful say). Individuals paying access bot would obviously choose 95 percent one. governments health authorities making decisions availability, logistics, pricing, might smart go less efficient one, get quicker.. might come insurance covering / public health offering Oxford free, pay one mRNA options wish. choice 70% free 95% for, let's say, $100 clear. THANK SCIENCE!  3 promising vaccines amazing. wonderful news. Pizzanista DTLA still open. get drive. Three Mondays row good vaccine news. might starting like Monday mornings. reckon it’ll get MHRA approval week tbh. They’re saying stuff care homes open visitors end year implies vaccine drive starting basically now. 12 morons. 3 got infected anyway. I'd expect almost airlines flying LA Dubai NZ least 3 meals Yesss, places too. Publix supermarkets area, give 10 dollar gift cards flu shots every year.  somewhat suspicious country would us right now. Like wow, things must rough allow us Americans covid in. month November GREAT. great. past two weeks? fucking blessing. Good shit. different GDPR laws EU v USA. Essentially, legal sense, USA provide overall expectation privacy, EU does, data collected EU would stored/processed differently, worth US publications given EU readership likely minimal. Hence, ""our website currently unavailable EU"". Wait, 18s allowed vaccine? brother high risk 16, allowed would included early January? would much appreciate go socialist. want see United States collapse like countries tried going full socialist. sleep Holiday Inn? US standard, know.  Solid result!! efficacy close 90% given specific dosage. Especially great news 3rd world countries, much easier produce. point fault voting corrupt party. passed point many years ago.

I keep trying help fellow Americans impactful way know, vote Democrats. make plenty money would happily pay significantly taxes meant neighbors could healthier, educated, happier. want live country many unhappy idiots. 

The working class needs wake fuck start voting politicians actually give shit clear every one politicians Democrat. 

Should've Bernie. least guy genuinely cares American citizens. He's bullshitting.   3 vaccines, 90% protection more.

Beginning end boys. Yeah that's bit weird, i'm reserving applause get knowledgeable take tomorrow half+full much better full+full looks backwards enough suspicious.

Hopefully, [Derek Lowe publishes something time wake Yea I’m pretty sure we’ll shortly referring one ~90% effective well, it’s solidified they’ll half first dose regimen data finalized verified.  Anybody asking food stamps looked on. Unfortunately people think poor means moral failure. Neofeudalism. We’re serfs again. make sure we’re woo-hoo-ing praising science, show/link sources studies best can? 

There already anti-vax movement brewing beat documentation... I’ve seen little that. error correcting enzymes mutated less flu.

It's likely vaccines may effective 4 many years. entirely unknown yet. unlikely probably quite impossible route transmission.

You would probably touch exact spot droplet landed fairly quickly happens, immediately touch inside nose eyeball/interior eyelids fingertip dipped droplet. Anything short unlikely cause infection. makes complete sense. Exciting news regardless, also given, reading correctly, exceedingly low rates side effects. release highlight ""
No hospitalisations severe cases COVID-19 participants treated AZD1222""  Sure, people like Mich McConnell don’t give shit what’s better long term, strictly *short term thinkers* . thought long run, climate change would top priority instead burred issue. decrease viral dose though producing milder illness. might rules abide press releases. Hopefully scientific paper released following weeks. much he's done want know real inner monologue like. spontaneous aneurysm hate everyone. I'm 28 work CNA LTC facility positive Covid residents (no symptoms facility claiming might false positives.) via googling cuz noticed ""N95"" mask employer gave KN95 curious difference found lot ""N95"" masks provided employer counterfeit NIOSH approved (not sure facility even realizes not). I've working covid residents last 2 nights wearing masks. I've religiously practicing hand hygiene careful. wondering chances getting covid circumstances? they're showing symptoms, I'm keeping much distance possible providing care practicing excessive hand hygiene. Lol. Sacred what? never said anything neglecting anything. Change energy industries needs happen, can't like flipping switch. would cause complete crash economy. everyone afford tesla runs electricity. use gas power almost shipping industry. would come screeching halt oil industry went poof. Think act. needs done gradually. let emotions cloud judgement.  That's good. wonder also distributed end year? looks like UK might get bulk, countries get also? Let's also note vaccine easier produce, store transport. likely play bigger role fighting virus developing world especially cheaper produce others. welcome fact team behind honest (or assume) presenting 70% effective rather 90% get give half dose followed full dose, means trying get headline present facts trails. overwhelmingly good news.  I'm sorry facts facts.  

If want government works, stop electing people insist cannot care hurt proving right.

Who view people insisting government can't possibly work? Hell who's charge pandemic? bang job done! guess I’ll pass one well, vaccine tops 99.9% death rate comes COVID 3-4 meals? airline booking with? believe it, ""best practice 
"" guidelines specify keep doors closed rooms without negative pressure. see. Tbh, truth statement. many businesses permanently closed going take least half year societies readjust. China lockdown three weeks (during new year season) still many businesses closed good. Shut downs dont work.. would require 100% compliance would never happen. Get fuck outta *extreme left


but comment ideology particular, mean extreme. ""Eat, drink, merry tomorrow may die.""

""YOLO!"" quit never signed shit.  even see 3000 deaths day January.

We pass number December, Christmas. 17th... Hmm guys trust political website health policy journal?

Yes I’m aware health policy journal still arguing masks 2020, least acknowledges didn’t work 1918.

Experts reviewing evidence 1918 concluded flu masks failed control infection. December 1918, American Public Health Association recommended “wearing proper masks” compulsory medical staff, occupations “barbers, dentists, etc.,” “all directly exposed infection.” committee also found, however, evidence “as beneficial results consequent enforced wearing masks entire population times contradictory,” thus committee recommend “the widespread adoption practice.” committee recommend persons “who desire wear masks” “instructed make wear proper masks, encouraged 1919, Wilfred Kellogg’s study California State Board Health concluded mask ordinances “applied forcibly entire communities” decrease cases deaths, confirmed comparisons cities widely divergent policies masking.

Not going ration card; going burn lot Nurses Doctors busting ass save us. Thanksgiving I'm thankful done. last people care poor uneducated, actually. true crisis situations.  Shameful. I’m curious DeSantis found him. 

Was browsing conspiracy forums picked random name hat? Still terrible headline replace convid fever. call means testing. Means testing check people giving aid actually need aid. Means testing supposed allow government help people need limited resources government. misused Cons 
to dissuade everyone — especially people need — using service. reasoning goes “If need aid receive aid, means dependent aid” point helping people get back feet lot cheaper scraping rotting corpse floor. I'm guessing ""america bad"" thing, guy bunch stock BioNTech, kind weird keep coming it. two people wear masks stay 6 ft. apart, they’re 70% effective according CDC Furloughed and/or laid off.

This pretty shitty. stimulus time around either  live Reno. People care. whole state needs shut down. ""God works mysterious ways."" need get shithole state give fuck well being. (among others) fallacy is: false dichotomy.

A correlative-based fallacy statement falsely claims assumes ""either/or"" situation, fact least one additional logically valid option. case, least one many forms economic principles.

Capitalism capitalism's sake lead negative extremes unlike see purely communist state. said many degrees capitalistic models social nets factors considered, still operate free market. Whereas many pundits political figures would believe American Senator Bernie Sanders socialist, calls democratic socialist. world definitions still much believer capitalism private markets. Europe several countries leaders parties far left leaning see America. world standards, Sanders little left middle. Joe Biden right middle. American whole right middle; though minority subjugation￼, moving direction similar far right fascism.

Don’t throw stupid shit around. internet exists now, least attempt use educate little bit. But, perhaps they've gotten better, repeatedly seen cases people testing negative infecting people contact day later testing positive? tests indication whether person infectious, although requires sufficiently high viral load test positive. thought considered people infectious reach point would get positive result? Chinese bars airports populated US. still get Remember Redditors, outdoor transmission real. Wear mask EVERYWHERE, including park, car, even house.

Tonight want say words carry us enter winter darkness. year, world changed eyes. Earlier spring, faced gigantic challenge form pandemic. new corona virus forced us make great sacrifices. much hold dear give up, much everyday life cancel avoid. tonight, late November 2020, clear time return normal. Therefore, will, again, ask something difficult, absolutely necessary.

The little respite got summer autumn really over. Back then, neighbors friends could see eachother outdoors coffee, could meet fragile relatives fresh air. Life turn normal, times beautiful summer days almost felt way. spring, many said nevertheless made life easier coronavirus strike bright March dark November. November. Human health lives still danger, danger increasing. people infected, intensive care units used seriously covid-sick patients, people die.

Let us remember 6000 people Sweden already died covid-19. Let us remember around every deceased person people deprived beloved parent, beloved child, beloved friend. Let us remember burdened care nursing staff were, let us remember still struggling day night save lives.

What country wrong now, suffer later. right now, enjoy later. affects Lucia celebration look like, Christmas celebration look like, still us Christmas. may sound harsh, may sound brutal, that's harsh brutal reality is. know flatten infection spread curve, done before, spring. Back then, coronavirus came country, agreed take responsibility. took responsibility Sweden. protected ourselves, loved ones, people even know are. took responsibility gave staff health care nursing care chance address acute crisis. together. strength, Sweden's strength.

During autumn, many neglected follow advice recommendations. see people starting take responsibility again, travel decreasing work home increasing. Keep going persevere. everyone more, me. stay date advice recommendations apply are. meet people live with. live alone, choose one two friends hang with, keep distance. Stay home slightest symptom, wash hands, often thoroughly. employers, possible, enable employees work home. things would like do, necessary, cancel, avoid, postpone. get this, new norm whole society, whole Sweden.

To feel everything dark now, want say: Everything hopeless. Sweden tested, yes, Sweden stand ground. all, healthcare system work, despite all. Houses roads built, despite all. children get education desire learn, despite all. going take situation seriously, going control, firmness, courage.

To feel really concern you, want say this: Even become mildly ill infect others, restaurant, work, dinner, bus, store. stranger infect become ill, friend infect may need care. grandparent infect may die. people make sacrifices, people show determination, self-discipline, sense responsibility.

When one day crisis, everyone able remember helped other. Remember solidarity, remember feeling community, feeling right. Remember pushed spread infection lifted country. must, now, show cohesion, responsibility, stronger virus defeat.

Now this, together, Sweden. took Moderna 25 days actual produced vaccine time virus sequenced. That's incredible. Nah, fine leave open. worried, stay basement Same, zoom school worse school could probably convince Rapture already happened. helped May people stimulus money coming in. extra unemployment. lol. Better hope de Blasio say OK. Cuomo forced say de Blasio authority say that, fact, OK de Blasio fink. virus 99.8% survival rate lmao um yes people going continue live lives like normal. 🤣🤣 yes does! Nobody cares. due respect, offence intended, I'd concentrate sorting shit US giving advice people countries you.

Relax everybody, take mask, enjoy thanksgiving... Idk got downvoted, said true lmao. agree 100% pharmaceutical companies kept accomplishments quiet left vaccines shelf collect dust another year, public hesitant. thank science eternally grateful accomplishment instead whining. experts doing. ""skeptical"" global warming, change fact experts field come conclusion happening. Experts done testing vaccine (which also part reason vaccine quick, fact required infections phase 3 trial happening fast) FDA approves, agree vaccine safe use. ""skeptical"" act like saying ""hmmm, get experts field telling safe I'm sure fancy number data stuff, science wrong sometimes, might sit one out"" integral part scientific method options nearly unrestrained capitalism USA, authoritarian ""communism"" China, North Korea Venezuela. (I put quote marks there, China's North Korea's so-called communism barely fit definition.)

I wish Americans would willing learn countries, whose populaces enjoy far better qualities life - New Zealand Scandinavian countries. Heck, countries even enjoy *more freedoms* USA, ""freedom"" defined terms ""freedom from..."" (e.g. school shootings, violent crime, crippling debt, public good degradation, fear fellow citizens) well ""freedom to..."" (e.g. carry gun around public.)

Heck, love capitalism much, try emulating personal favourite, Singapore? one profit-driven countries world, second New Zealand terms ease business, much government policy bent towards helping large corporations here. yet, population enjoys arguably best public infrastructure anywhere world, literally best education system world, high degrees government support (e.g. 80% Singaporeans' homes built government provided heavy subsidies handouts), nearly zero violent crime, etc. throughout pandemic, citizenry enjoyed comparatively swift decisive action, two rounds free PPE, multiple cash handouts, rapid economic reopening, 15th lowest number deaths-per-capita world.  funny, half yall dont even visit grandparents anyways, sudden virus visit ... okay lol Bars indoor gyms closed, too. leaves grocery shopping. stores occupancy limits. alone. left since December (had baby stay first 12 weeks since vaccinated, Covid). well baby visits pediatrician that's it. long countries keep away Americans $$$ literally posts thing thread every day haven’t noticed, zero respect anti-mask morons. hope stupid fuckers bottom hospital room waiting list. People right thing priority. Definitely safer trying fly going using arms tall building takeoff Oxford vaccine behind schedule due safety concerns put trials pause. Trump’s political rallies. Halloween. Possibly Election Day. Total lack respect half population follow medical guidelines. upcoming soon fallout holidays. dumbass parents (in mid 70s) going stepsister's place Thanksgiving. stepsister school teacher who's in-class teaching entire time (gotta love Texas R propaganda) going sports gatherings, etc masks on. seriously asked mom get order went.

Wtf people thinking?

If get sick, can't leave Japan come see them. allowed hospital anyway. even could, allowed come back home Japan afterwards. fucking selfish irresponsible, I'm made asshole discouraging this.

I lovely gathering Zoom friends, ideal, prevented us DYING. post whole article require 14 day isolation amongst requirements. would hazard guess UK SK would amongst those. plenty healthcare workers getting unfortunately see HIV Defense Squad today. make alinated people, rest family fine living life enjoying it. US white house outbreaks. tested daily, even without contact traced close contacts? thought whole lesson rapid testing without precautions cant prevent spread. UK want rush approve US does?  Im pretty sure you’re one who’s prepared sufficiently lol end day yourself. UK effective thrown towel, months ago.
Quarantine mandatory enforceable financial social support must provided, difficult domestic situations alternative quarantine arrangements must also made available free charge. 
This done state Victoria Australia knocked virus out, serious critical difference us UK Boris. even tourist fucking country car, let alone hop plane go somewhere else. freshly renewed passport 2019 fine sitting loft, thanks. Endless 4 ply toilet paper avocado toast. Could imagine... gives us hope US might actually get vaccine someday! Even **are** moderators bad idea. like there's vetting process moderator cellphone video convinced me. Anywho, I'm happy know side 3% guys on. think reopened economy is! Surely everywhere envy South Dakota soon! desperately tried get trials. That's gonna fall deaf ears lol No, is. 

It's worded way worded uses false correlation. NZ lot things going it...

The Island bit definitely helped.

Smaller population definitely made containment bit easier

Lower population density prevented/ slowed explosive transmission events like seen NYC NE NJ

Better education helped even know...

People able trust government opposed US where...

Well, know...

I family NZ always wanted visit, year/ ever let us I'd tempted whatever stay come back shitshow...  South Dakota spent covid relief money tourism ads though. person know that's bitching 75 severe asthma. tears anecdotal. Medical people family tell stories. believe fox news family Good segment. Thanks sharing. Outdoor dining reason LA's cases 4k daily, indoor social gatherings are. Patching tiny hole pipe going fix water flow there's three inches missing line. zero evidence showing us outdoor dining risk. pushing enforcement shutdowns. addressing real problem indoor gatherings. ga, may participate competition mean happy that, power you. pretend second I've ""just fine"" without things. *can* live without lot stuff, absolutely want to, definitely taken toll mental health.

Let people want. wild concept. exclusive dinner parties week :( Yikes. That's pretty crazy. First, negative test result night mean it. Second, 17k people could instead 30 40 initial 7. justifying 9/11 victim shaming us? Dear god, sick. Stop generalizing entire nations please educate maybe pick bible you’re Covid joke. never know body respond virus. could easy, could long lasting health issues. 

When see even athletes like Cody Garbrandt end health issues post-infection, doesn’t make want take chances virus even young healthy. Statistically ok, knows issues I’ll may deal line get sick. Even physically healthy people end issues. country needs unionize, greedy capitalists treat blue collar workers like garbage. special kind stupid. see WI GOP coming around reasonable time soon. mean huge difference 1918 vaccines. multiple vaccine candidates seem safe effective. Maybe irony strong suit. ok though bro tried, that's what's important.

Did fun? fun we're winners! expected 5/10 - approximately proportion voted Biden trump. guess rounded intending hurt business? need tinfoil hat theory? Thanks, Wisconsin GOP! think I'll that. driving crazy respond professional way/opinion, worse, forget it, type out, deleted. P100 kind use put solvents wood stuff; totally different kind thing paper disposable ones doctors use. thing happened ""REOPEN ECONOMY"" people got way couple weeks shortage paramedics.

Now ""well can't controlled people"" idiots go them. People fucking stupid don’t realize masks help minimize lockdowns. Serious value money. Got it. You’re talking people likely opposed doing/public health guidance. Given holiday travel anticipated drop 10% year, there’s pretty huge difference done done. pandemic gonna politicians decide. gonna people decide. RemindMe! 2 years ""let virus run course"" plausible. control this. keep altering posts you’ve responded America unified recovery trial like NHS we'd get promising treatments quickly. think means he's going spit us. hostile expect sex workers, like every worker, report income IRS? following state mandated health protocols Nevada's sex workers? Would consider hostile told expected food service workers wash hands? mean kind makes sense. think people advocating countries export vaccines protecting people users subreddit never want lockdowns end. read 90% effective dose tested enough people call safe yet. actually think ""Canopy walls"" reason cases 4k daily copious amounts people socializing gathering indoors?  Yes - also whether payload immunity lasts longer vector immunity. I’m wondering whether AZ vaccine suitable annual boosters turn necessary. search numbers probably confounded asymptomatic people searching pre-T'giving test, read much them.

The travel numbers, though... used FEMA DOD food stockpiles distribution. everything solved free market. That’s *the point.* SNL live since November 7, 2020 watching rerun.... shown put mask paper bag, container airtight, OK use 5 days. drive often, maybe mask rear view mirror OK use while. One long time making.

Thank scientific research!  bullshit. Outdoor dining reason cases 4k daily. Indoor social gatherings are. tired drove X restaurant saw people standing outside science fucking showing us indoor gatherings. personal anecdotes translated opinions insane. two aspects trials, safety efficacy. 1+1 dose regime contribute safety side, generally gets ignored, obviously sexy efficacy data. 

On efficacy side, baseline set 62%. probably get updated interim results relatively shortly - happened Biontech-Pfizer, test population expanded second wave triggers ""events"", we'll get data greater levels confidence. Eh, partially true. Funding participation big reason phase 3 trials tend take longer. It’s easier get statistically significant results wait while, need fewer volunteers. COVID widespread, get effectiveness results quickly since people contracting disease. Hospitalization rate meaning number total infected need go hospital given time, total number population. yes leads deaths. get treated anything, covid, room hospitals?

As last part, making decisions themselves, making decision others.  ""living"" defined everything easily infect covid. things avoiding risky things worst manner. need crowd bars unmasked, need 20 person thanksgiving dinner flying across country middle fucking pandemic.  Honestly, hard sit still bit let shit pass? mean complained FDA approving vaccine election. trying interfere, succeed. lot people, included, like nothing vacations bored. happily spend week beach resort, next year plan take five-day cross-country train trip going anywhere room, observation car, dining car. I'll look scenery, read books, decompress. That's idea vacation, yeah I'd want cruise. That's great news. Cheap, easy transport store, yet effective vaccine compared mRNA counterparts.

Although potential caveats viral vector vaccines? viral vectors new thing used past? Hospitals can't place 1-year old adult ICU beds. pediatric neonatal beds children. Remember rich. Americans poor. least long term side effects show (for vax virus). like mesothelioma sub. found interesting lockdowns statistically significant effect.

Pretty shocking costly measures terms public health side-effects economic side-effects. thought trusting science this.

“Internal lockdown associated nonsignificant 2.4% reduction mortality week (P = 0.83).” would better half shutdown we're going last 10 months. Yeah FDA definitely stood end. long people dying outside hospital sidewalk.  never said acceptable.
 
And must live ideal world positions leadership ever occupied qualified people.
 
Back Earth, case. And, better worse, problems - especially personal nature - largely own.
 
The point comment merely suggest even people may act rude manner presently might necessarily defined perpetuity. year taken toll lot people - leaders included. hard sometimes bear responsibility trying keep ship running, preserving many jobs possible still trying accommodating comes problems every single report.  40% country believed Dear Leader said hoax lol. know long vaccines expected last?  like flu vaccine good around 6 months? think answer know yet, follow question... would know information? Wonderful. Great, constructive comment there. I'm expert never claimed be, still think pandemic really going die 2021, year beyond that. agree totally. many secondary deaths. also comes experts' confusion (although conclusive) spread much expected Floyd protests. No. Calculations IFR take account. Also hospitalisations numbers are. bigger problem LA indoor social gatherings, outdoor dining reason cases 4K daily. Yep. see old people giving one ounce fuck I'm like trying protect people? due date late May, I’m curious timing go. loathe distance teaching worried going back unsafe conditions. r/teachers know person nightmare accurate reporting quarantining. Get full body sun special vitamin producing lamps buy. take supplements [Yeah look geriatric protestors Lots people struggle get working places decided without. think others feel you, I'm saying anything wrong it. going real un/underemployment problem. well 40% hospital admissions LA County right 65! reflect recent surge cases past week. So, protecting seniors stabilize health care system sheer number cases. contagious rare, could vaccinate elderly see dramatic drop outbreaks.  California deaths consistently lower. might trail — well see.

Again tell percentage lower deaths attributed outdoor dining. making policy decisions devoid data facts.  sure, whatever makes happy dude, sorry dick. cases going up?
 
Easy question. Yesterdays (and last weeks) US numbers look better expected cant explain since restrictions seem minimal. mean stop going unnecessary places. still safe practices use going out... people don’t use them. Well nothing left embrace it! /s 6 60 worries me. one million Americans traveled plane Friday. take 3 weeks see spread day alone, mention days travel people traveling back home Thanksgiving. scenario repeats Christmas people socialize New Years Eve. hit peak yet, long shot. AMURICA FUCK YEAHHH strangely still tries getting help experts despite smarter /s going herd immunity, done summer promote spread virus (such allowing large gatherings again, even air-bombing large groups people virus)? authorities truly believed herd immunity, would wanted virus spread much possible milder summer months get everyone ready winter. rate infection drop low levels summer must catastrophic failure herd immunity strategy something mainstream media would reported on. agree. Honestly, that's like threads like headline. 90% people going see headline, avoid comments, think, ""Well, Oxford vaccine sucks!"" 9% people going go comments think, ""Oh, half dose great Moderna Pfizer."" 1% people probably realize really need wait see data *all* vaccines making conclusions. exactly fantastic people FDA similar bodies around world (and probably moment). forget making states fight PPE, taking shipments selling friends resold states markup. Giving certain power players heads stock dumps/buys. much. taste *prison guards literally site*



Nah late 4000 Benghazzis...... probably reddit deleting account knows? I'm right you. saw breaking news wanted share it. mistake expecting circlejerking redditors enough brain cells think past post's vote count: post downvoted, clearly means wrong downvoted May? Bruhhhhhh Maybe get included Australian New Zealand travel bubble? Wait. Science?  listen that? /s


Seriously though. next fight anti-vaxxers. I’m sure they’ll characters screaming wearing masks. Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* 2000 day = number 1 cause death day.... Pretty ironic freedom might downfall country lmfao 2000 day = number 1 cause death day. Irish guy seem grasp fucked live country civilians murdered police regular

[Are ""leading behind"" Incredible it? could correlation wonder? Hmm.. let's wait phase 3 results India wherever else trials occurring Doesn’t strike safe though. they're going jump queue they. decent politicians wouldn't, they'd accept whichever risk group wait everyone else group. anti-vax people think politicians jump queue like prove something good enough proof anyway. Statistics produced specific concern leave whitewater now. people upset this? great news! says herd immunity 40%. vacine 95% Rt restrictions sounds right. However sure restrictions lifted Rt go 2.5 least. puts herd immunity 60%. still reasonable. get 80% would hard get enough sceptics anti-vacers resisting. know UK, corner Germany released specific sites target capacities vaccination centers recently. works 0.5% population per day. course lots variables, ballpark figure seems achievable. Yes man, happy :D It’s beyond evil. 

“Your husband died service State. Claim denied Please vacate premises office people family work government. that...*checks records*....is longer you.”

But shouldn’t shocked. country sends kids war, the. Doesn’t care end STREET. many ways realistic result better ammunition anti vaxxers. governments ought making free everyone. full doses effectiveness 62% combining strategies around 70%. obvious data 90% dosage strategy less percentage vary lot 1 2 cases. Well guess I'm gonna try meet sooner stupid stuff like playing Russian roulette pretending pandemic exist. Win stupid prizes Carelessness tying shoe laces properly.

Letting 15000 people die small country like Belgium mass murder. know. news/actuality program tv saw interview Greek man living one islands. showed using hose cleaning little terrace.

He said pay water since 70's! Apparently, village counsel, water company, governmental organization bothered slap snout!

How found out? anyone care? Greece got massive economic financial crisis northern nations bail out...and criticized tax payers giving billions nation fakelaki culture.

It boggles mind. Italy barely better. demanded cash EU, Spain, pandemic hard hit them. Well happy UK Brexit much worse. pandemic hitting many European nations pretty hard. 

But shall never het coin back southerners. never position bail us ever need it. Maybe indeed split Europe, Nothern EU Southern EU. Maybe foce southerners adopt different mentality life finance proper economics. 

In scenario, die. better like Germany e.g. collapse. strange media reporting 70% efficacy averaging two dosing regimens. Giving initial half dose followed full dose 90% efficacy. That's Darwinism, baby. believe India massively involved manufacturing vaccine. give shout India. Serum Institute India, biggest producer said India get 100m doses December. 40m doses already prepared early November.  
  
They also responsible producing doses [GAVI COVAX countries, essentially list 91 low income countries.  
  
Other this, lots countries struck deals AstraZeneca production/buying doses people. Yes since reading stuff, train lot less, worried virus know it.. Drives insane :/ air filtration makes much safer. stuff actual time air running full blast thats issue. Another fun fact texas, TEA(Heads education) told schools lose funding next year go full virtual learning anytime remainder school year fear writers 2020 setting us big disappointment December finale raising hopes up. True Moderna one $50 per patient opposed Oxford one £3 per patient. Im sure whether truly costs produce whether US thing making money leading factor.

I guess ultimately every vaccine widely used due demand. think cost ease use going play big part though governments likely opting that, expensive vaccines effective. matter one groups given full diese group 1 half? It’s weird efficacy would much lower group makes think don’t yet enough data (not enough vaccinated people exposed virus).  daughter attends college state fly home. campus dorms closing January 10th. I'm scared she'll catch spread whole family. We've isolating goes class lives dorm. can't even get test testing symptomatic people. virus going around?  Word 2020 science attack. There's probably others. hear them. Perhaps higher initial dose caused body develop immunity vector. found sister flying boyfriend Nashville Friday friend's 30th birthday party. He's flying Europe Nashville parents live. Shit makes angry. Trying convey information fit 30 second soundbite Americans damn near impossiblity. look ""t test"" would give good starting spot. looked study yet probably used version ""chi squared"" ""binomial"" test. common group tests. Insurance companies use similar tests predict get accident banks use predict charge credit cards.

Enjoy, stats interesting fun forced study them. three.

Let's roll sucker get lives back. faith back March would maybe one two vaccines time great news. anti-vaccine people seem suspicious covid. ever asked doctor hospital years data approved medication they've given? likely answer never, determined see vaccines 'dangerous' even though tested 40,000 people now. I'd take chances 1 20% chance getting critically ill. three months 4,000 people 1,000 burials sea. Cruise ships already floating disease vectors there's *not* global pandemic. anyone would choose *now* take cruise mind-bogglingly stupid. Results interesting one though. Half dose + full dose month later got 90%. Full dose + full dose month later 60%. Hope hypothesis why. I'm heading /r/covid19 (science moderated) see think ha Honestly I'm completely fine Republicans giving Trump credit this. Whatever. Go it. get vaccine get back regular they'll continue wearing masks social distancing everywhere.

They're going mask distance. even now. Things finally looking up! What's next? Covid stingrays. convinced Trump family members took it. convinced matter ok, they'll continue wearing masks social distancing everywhere. wanted spit assholes public wearing mask like goddamn chin strap, true. that's whole problem, ICU's filling covid-19 patients, room diseases accidents.

Some urgent procedures postponed go long... 

This meant write ""the medical system collapsing"". simply rooms left doctors left time treat anything... people dying ambulances home much higher rates normally. Nothing wrong graph, going second lockdown Melbourne wanted like NZ 0 active cases. fire seasons getting longer, fire getting formerly unreachable places used wet burn. instead 3 4 months dry area bushfires, 7 8 months places like rainforests alpine heath bogs burning. FWIW, downvote you. concern probably comes right place. fail see statistics support point.  That’s Pfizer one. Moderna one.  Yeah long term effects vaccine novel virus already discovered? *That’s uh.*. he’s sceptical about. go half dose plus full dose that's 25% less vaccine used per person, meaning might actually 5m doses ready 120m way. LoNg TeRm eFfecTs?? 4 87 lot higher. fact can't run 90% efficacy without context. submit 90% dosing figure regulators surprised get pretty skeptical data infections dataset (the FDA told Pfizer revise interim analysis checkpoint 32 infections higher number deemed insufficient determine efficacy) went H20i year shit spot single person wearing mask. decided leave 3 hours becoming apparent huge risk. even called large groups believing covid wearing masks, heard tons ""Covids hoax"". (H20i maryland ocean city car event btw) ton people still jobs, yeah :( I'm Mitch. must mistaking mother Herman Cain. I'm neutral observer read entire chain comments gotta say, seem real fuckin dumb Here's CSL press release claiming manufacturing start 9th November: seem better immunity western world. remember reading post sub months back said poorer hygiene leads immunity towards Covid. Also Covid actually dangerous virus compared infections floating around. 

Makes sense think bit it. millions could die pizza place closed; unfair! /s\*\^&amp;\*\^\*\^\*&amp;(\^\*(\^\* Well hope allow add debit card use like NFC. IMHO refusing wear mask grounds health insurance companies deny coverage. insurance investigator finds anti-mask bullshit someone's history, denied health coverage way arsonist would denied fire damage coverage. Also note article, “There also intriguing data suggests perfecting dose could increase protection 90%.” Cool first. Hell yeah pump full go pub fuck fluke would statistically significant though. guys didn’t literally bring cases zero Thats good see this, crazy see low effort putting general. world wanted, could choose tasks fix one one every year. no, lets take 10 years happen No, all. believe handled safely take vaccine available.  mean, long term thinkers, climate change even thing would changed moment learned stopped things long got point want factor locked R rate 

During worst months summer went 1.6 worst places. Many 1.0-1.3 even september lockdown. (Most places 1.0, 1.3 highest places UK lockdown). 

With R0 1.5, avg UK seen year, number 70% efficient vaccine 80% population plummets 0.66 would incredible.

(That without factoring Oxford vaccine maximum efficiency 90% avg 70% according trial).  Sweden can't legally lockdown,

what dumbass country. Good point developing countries. People self isolating cannot fully contribute functioning economy? 9/11 again. Agree that. handling exponential growth, want trying tread tightrope around R0s 1.0, disaster waiting happen. need aim 1, leading eradication.

When comes back, use nation's worth trace testing capability cities/regions affected. Much better society general happiness percentage population unable leave homes, wanting concern everyone else, whatever like.

Or least seen enough others know worth living with, treatment/prevention longer issue (vaccines etc).

All imo ofc. Priorities differ people, put ""the greater good"" ""don't care"", may come different assessment situation. I'm disappointed outside ANZ I'm from, Western country even tried, especially given many Asian countries try, succeeded. think could done well Vietnam, tried. People can’t afford it? also countries can’t afford cold chain -70C.... lotta counties  owe anyone excuse. State intentions get it. Heard Maricopa county near ICU capacity staff even beds pushed in. wouldnt shocked moderna pfizer also plumet 60% teritory. also small samples profit organizations, clear reason storm sensational number increaso stocks... get 70% dose 90% 1.5 doses dont call 90% one 1 dose take 2 shots make baseline? believe it. 4th peak around December 5th.  vaccine contains adenovirus based vector. initial high dose, body probably builds adenovirus based antibodies rather ones bind spike protein. So, second dose, adenovirus based antibodies reduce response spike protein. That's hypothesis Yeah I’ll take it. now. be.

If flip fair coin 10 times comes heads every time, statistically significant result chance happening 0.1% time. However, 10 flips tiny number expect effect disappear 8 subsequently flipped coin 1000 times.

We could issue 130 positive cases spread across two dosage rates positive cases placebo group. Also trials tested everyone weekly allowing test sterilizing immunity. trials far tested prevention symptomatic COVID. half full regime lowered incidence asymptomatic COVID best news far. first tested indication vaccines slow spread. true value 62% effectiveness expected number sub-group would 38% x 30 = 11.4

my guess regimes 70% effective got lucky half dose + full dose regime unlucky 2 full doses regime I'm guessing done enough testing small large dose confidently state cautious rigorously tested? heart breaking. Fuck man... think use data point leave people life future, IntergalacticElkDick. Called it! way. point consider contagious next week regardless test result. kn95 rating system used overseas asia. effective lol pork knuckles great. actually ""knuckle"" part pig...it's meaty part leg. theory yes, compared 2 others 95%, would want one? comes counties case this

Not ""every one"". even close. Lots people give up, rightly take sign serious virus is. idiots literally drive another county evade ban, ""everyone"" likelihood small minority. math correct. real world different 🙂. Even R value 1, disease longer sever mild, already won. Hospitals loaded, ICUs free patients etc. Finally like common cold Near-normal spring likely. stop hearing hospitalizations deaths really elderly immune compromised vaccinated, that's matters. post comes extremely entitled. friend takes home, surely disrupting family life quite bit. mattresses offers, asking nothing return, aren’t standards? offers use car free charge get work, yet audacity pay gas too?! I’d interested hear side story.

r/choosingbeggars Well official strategy (flatten curve, like western world): claiming contradicting another strategy differs official one, try infect many possible without public knowing it, makes conspiracy. 

And no, think talking herd immunity work epidemiology counts strategy. n particularly small sample see Pfizer Moderna's data adequate, yes, course interim analysis three vaccines would need borne full results. fair though Pfizer multiple severe cases, one. Hm, OK "" u/blankthrowaway8 "" posts party line China, I'm sure I'll take word it. Cuomo say. He's holding holiday shopping. SPINELESS ok many doses able produce?? UK USA almost normal hy march-april..what EU? fucked up? dont hear anything receive march doses able vaccinate 3% EU population... tiring narrative, agreed. No, can't say do. can't remember read bit concern becoming immune vectored virus. want say WaPo overview status tracker... Venn diagram circle many people China part, also others trying escape lockdown wear mask properly.

However government react it. Roadblocks set (even trenches dug roads) people official permit leave enter Wuhan area.

People wearing masks escorted home police. Sometimes drones loud speakers admonishing them.

There even reports people comply, apartment door blocked rebar could open door little get food delivered. Also doors welded shut allow one exit could monitored.

There selfish people everywhere rules punishments needed protect protect others times crisis. need lot data arrive that. one major advantage mRNA lack vector. can't stress important is.
But along comes cooling issues unfortunately think would become post-COVID long hauler pushed exercise intensely soon could acute phase. river styx one greatest scientific achievements last 100 years? quickly? I'm curious, ever scenario local court denial higher court approval designed ""better ruling"" used widely support cause? 

I'm curious right we're witnessing Trump's campaign start shitty lawsuits local courts getting denied. So, appeal goes line, ruled favorably, set precedent cases? vaccine 1/5 price, needs kept fridge rather deep freeze, nearly effective Pfizer Moderns offerings.

Very uplifting news mean vaccine would widely available April? mean enough everyone? so, predictions things get back normal fall? florida tourism industry. do, need understand best mix testing method it’s uncertainties, periodicity, cost efficacy control. Testing whole population area costly difficult, need understand strategy work better. Go lock skepticism sub Reddit, there’s lot people sane there. essential worker bullshit? kind fantasy world live in? world think world could completely suld shut month half? greastest scientific breakthrough far 21st century... think context matters well. family pod isn’t taking risks (not going out, etc.) properly quarantines, risk basically 0. Unfortunately requires every single person right thing, hard. Conversely, actively traveling ones likely caught SARS-CoV-2. People staying home anyway pull average (by existing part population). Blue lives matter really matter. Desperate people experienced loss likely flock churches... setting itself, mixing different household parties like hypocritical Gov Newsom caught that's partly blame massive surge. past couple months i've probably received half dozen invites bday parties, nuptial celebrations, 1st bdays, etc... i've declined. know couple ppl basically rented entire restaurant patio invited 20+ guests private event. 

Also, closing on-premises dining way signaling public time hunker stop socializing. stage pandemic everyone jaded really takes extreme measures jolt ppl normal patterns behavior. is, I’m ‘expert.’ I’m doctor, epidemiologist, virologist scientist,” Lamb wrote internet site, Beyond Fold. “I also don’t need be. Experts don’t answers.”

Wow. 

I expect PhD MD statewide data management. would expect masters degree public health, epidemiology (bio)statistics. 

But article says $40k/yr job really low someone masters taking significant responsibility. like calling cancel thanksgiving calling cancel black friday. Can't flow shekels interrupted guess. actually German nursing homes react know someone positive home. close home, separate everyone test everyone every days new cases popping tests people recovered. used work rather great, lots Germans contagious many ""imports"" nursing homes take place, well longer PCR turnaround time, huge outbreaks unfortunately.

The technique works full-country-level obviously, need quite lot tests. China ""mega-city level"" works them. Flatten curve main strategy. Herd immunity said desirable secondary effect letting virus spread long could protect elderly... secondary effect obviously played part chosing strategy fight covid. LeBron self serving shit heads everywhere pal. rights well said. almost impossible understand complexities headline, tweet. amazed. capitalism. Big money made everyone wants piece pie. unseen amount effort since hit west hard. think Doctor Dildo would popular ship entertainment. Perhaps healthy young person wait later next year find places give vaccine, go one distribute one prefer. 
The sooner need it, less choice have. 

On hand: risk highest? going sooner rather later. perhaps vaccine lower effectiveness better higher effectiveness later, almost risk infection actually first months spread worst? adenovirus always thought children atom farfetched fallout games pandemic shown otherwise. could easily group fallout worshipping plague lol Thanks, makes feel better this! sine wave? makes perfect sense sources explain it? Checking in. comment chain gets better better month feels. course were, guess what? families go legally either. collateral damage people value supposed personal “freedoms” covid “hoax”. shit show. Agreed. wanted say take you, kinda defeats purpose haha. dunno might work get high profile politicians celebrities it. [Take look Elvis Polio sub political ones insane. Hardly reasonable people they're always blowing everything proportion. They've gone deep end Surely one best things no-one vaccine got severe covid. seems protect nearly 100% hospitalisation even stops 70% catching disease. That's huge.  Pfizer announces 90%

New competitor, moderna comes 94.5%

Pfizer second later, 95%

Now,

Oxford comes 70%,

What? one cares?

Goes 90%

Not vaccines, add up. different opinion. minimum purpose covid-19 vaccination make sure end hospital. People comorbid symptoms mild symptoms stress organs. achieved vaccine, I'm sure sufficient.
Note: dad heat disease live poor country. pfizer us sadly could phrased differently. agree you, defeatist attitude, see would taken badly someone bad spot. would taken back well? I'm sure grown since then. got lucky too. bad spot. get daughter weekends literally food, jobs, knowing going make next month's rent. got shit together, asked help employment WorkOne state, 8 years later small house decent car worry free clear. I'm taking classes learn (general maintenance, fixing broken machines), little little I'm making even gains. I'm religious, really like phrase ""God helps help themselves."" Fixating fact bad spot get anyone anywhere. interesting. 70% pretty bad compared two others 95%. Governments.are buying anyway. get 70% one still worry risk around take real. 95% much. Also slightly surprised Thai travel bubble going - although might linked China. Glad got one vaccine. Hopefully go December, even become available finally start putting end madness. Chances could politically motivated? 26. Drop out. Work part time bartender pizza maker. Pay low rent parents. Self teaching coding.
Stress levels low.

I think time young adults reconsider college. mandatory. never been. okly times Gt campaigns officially questioned. 

As insufficient testing, that's effective point exponential growth. Kind like fruit flies.

Day 1: 2 fruit flies

Day 2: 3 fruit flies

Day 3: 782 fruit flies think anyone understood wrinkles human immune system testing certainly going answer questions. It'salso individual. Dosage tests way finding dose works well whole population. probably case would better smaller larger dose (should e.g body mass?). dose need establish dose use going \*one\* dose though. need figure one works well average.

It also shows important test specifically children. child weighing 1/3 adult going get ""too large"" dose receive adult dose? might gove high adverse effects, tests also suggest could give lower level immunity. Let know find anything. must included half full regime reason. Adenovirus immunity preventing second dose working thing think of. They'll get beginning matter national security. that's common sense something general public understand. Really shows dangerous disease is. Apparently 1-2% prevalence (1% plus already knew positive get test now, plus false-negative result time) hospitals already heavy stress.  pockets humanity wouldn’t. Sad true. Remember you’re looking biggest pussies scared anything sit subreddit getting fear 24/7 love see fake bad news validates existence here. one know actually like people, quite opposite regardless political affiliation. It’s frustrating see Europe, used part “Global North” producing “cheapest”/ least effective among new vaccines. population old, need vaccine effective possible!  telling sneeze mask? would fucking disgusting people said clearly read basic health statistics, stated 1 10,000 infected people age 40 dying (it's probably even lower now). virus dangerous elderly immunocompromised average sub-40 year old really death sentence. story. People simply ignorant beyond comprehension. one compare terms safety others?  Excellent response.  Something consider participants Oxford trial swabbed weekly, whereas Moderna Pfizer tested symptomatic infections. trial protocols same, possible would found similar levels effectiveness. always say, insurance companies don’t make money giving away. place every country got money pay millions doses vaccines. thin air, many governments get money pay things.  What's wrong that? I'm aiming PhD future, got start making contacts. That... doesn’t sound legal?


ETA: work Amazon , infamous shitty treatment employees, even don’t use PTO get Covid Yeah, point politics actual science wanting save lives. Ah yes, emigrating told escape persecution better life totally comparable entitled wimp can’t wear mask avoid partying weeks. I'm curious GSK-Sanofi - I'm disappointed far out.

Agreed temperatures - people overblowing worries logistics. you’re really scared take hydroxychloroquine

Lol.

But seriously there’s lot strawman arguments it’s even worth it. one live vaccine? wondering medication take makes can’t receive live vaccine. city goverment contracted Belltech Logix help tech needs, BL uses contactor companies hire temporary techs....the way worked out, techs meeting people face-to-face ""essential workers"" also uninsured ""contractors."" 

...i live 15th largest city, richest country earth, city government's full-time techs even recieving healthcare. fucked up. Capitalism evil. Lower 12.5%, think. save link, seperate paper suggested 75% infections occured 4 day window symptoms onset (from 2 day 2 days after), least dividing 25% 2. one people........yeah. 


Until concert touring back full swing, I'm still unemployed. that's going last thing come back ""normal"", sadly.  UK failure leadership think. help, non-stupid population helps more. cop shot guy killed 4 Dallas cops. shot suspect survived. insurance claimed work related originally. 

Insurance companies fucking evil   get lockdowns become default public policy ""contain"" anything government like.

For reference, think issue contentious one. criticise black-white nature people saying _definitely true_ _definitely false_, Tegnell Giesecke still said done questionable things. opinion, half anti vaxxers talk instigators. ""Rushed"" least clarified idea vaccine development process works people easily avoid wasting time reading rest comment average then? would great could test everyone infected actually stayed home. reality unless everyone forced tested, cost asymptomatic would actually obey stay home orders, studies like absolutely pointless. 
Unfortunately live reality people even believe Covid-19 exists, others think spread phone masts/5G heads state go around spreading rumours mis-information it. Article NAU Flagstaff, ASU. Wow, Redditor knows professor friends. would assume anyone cares income inequality would also suggest government provide said support  see. didnt count number countries, northern europe, value whole doesnt seem much different, id include eastern europe.

Yeah even worth arguing kinds people. Cancer? way NHS works, suspect whatever available effective RNA vaccines go key workers/people high risk categories, remainder public get Astrazenica one.

Longer term, pass. probably depend initial round immunization actually case numbers real world. NHS wasn’t safe now. senior Tory even recorded saying ‘scrap NHS’ entire party would voted next election. Alright.

Prove it. Congress needs get shit together. actively spreading disease. manifesto. Also, Das Kapital, that's much longer text. I'm calling names insult me. They're different annual flu shot. Risks quite low harm cycling dosage. 10000 one week, 5000 next. Vitamin intoxication possible rare. annual physical back February doctor updated vaccines, nice seeing news like this. Read AZ release. much want return normal think probably overly optimistic. important remember we're intentionally infecting anyone COVID trials run current conditions. actually know effective percent large crowds masks. also takes something like 6 weeks effective. point vaccine let work current conditions enough community spread drops near zero. Things better next year still take time get normal again. Dammit, Kevin. week we'll protests ""REOPEN CHRISTMAS!!1!"" takeaway it’s 90% optimal they’re gonna give people less optimal dose regimens Polls already showing 60% US plan getting vaccine. number steadily growing since summer vaccines continue trials. time 60% already want vaccine get least 20% willing take it. read posts dude, you’re fuck feelings crowd. talk feelings.

Just like rest them. minimum intelligence required understand new drug application process rigorous statistics involved. 'opinion' invalid. Stop spouting nonsense misinforming people. Jesus Christ. weighing something like $10billion spend option dropping 90 70&amp; effective costs $400million

US GDP $20.54T. difference 70% 90% efficacy could mean ending pandemic two months sooner.

$9.6B 0.56% one month's economic output.

Ending pandemic would probably increase economy 5-6% immediately, $47 per person cost would probably boost productivity $1,000. tax take would justify extra cost, never mind overall increase productivity.

That said:

1. Oxford *may* get 90% efficacy different dosing regimen; 
2. important thing get people vaccinated way reduces transmission seriousness disease, worry details later. 70% valuable 90% three six months. 1st full dose wait 4 weeks 2nd full dose = 62% protection

1st dose (half) wait 4 weeks 2nd full dose = 90% protection

The reason probably body mounting immune response vaccine backbone, chimp adenovirus, thus making second booster shot less effective. 

Results preliminary may change. vaccines targeted children adults? heard NPR broadcast talking left impression studies approvals would adults only. don’t know case. guy worst governor US competition Noem Kemp. wait 12 months, you’ll probably get pick. it’ll first available offered first batches.

I'm starting get tired winning. morons can't keep masks on.

Well thought U.V. light sun kill virus. doesn't, baking inside hot car long enough surely will.


Besides, Covid-19 spontaneously appear inside someone's vehicle. expect tourists San Luis Obispo county

lol lovely. Please provide examples misinformed about. 

You repeating pretty much exactly quoted another article source. think get it, even mention suboptimal dosing? Like use optimal dose, no? FUCKING FINALLY privileged jerks received top line medical care unavailable anyone else....but also first line vaccine arguably longer need. Infuriating.

The way could even partially redeem would get national stage - shout hours need wear masks, reduce travel, take vaccine - rolling sleeves taking shot Fauci himself. is. son works assisted living facility got Covid outbreak occurring there. two weeks required use PTO, one week PTO left. company allowed accrue “negative PTO” forfeit one week next years vacation. illness contracted facility. 

Now he’s recovered they’re sending memory care units therapy, he’s one workers immune disease. benefit illness (his company charge billable hours) penalized PTO. 

After recovered went back work, received care package blanket, mug box hot tea mail. Also people deficient . I'm Switzerland. There's major distrust science medicine somehow Bill Gates conspiracies took hold even amongst reasonable people circles. Facts dont care feelings? Get help man youre way angry. Also virus made political ""your group"" talk covid without politics would talking entirety. insult please take downvote! Ok, fact remains covid vaccines tested accelerated schedule relative vaccines. testing simply can’t robust vaccines time gets rolled out. clarify this? don’t know takeaway asked doctor’s office setting, no. asked bar, maybe yes. keep mind there’s something called vaccine reactivity, would unnecessary risk severe(haven’t seen yet) US understand consequences actions, China offered win-win US rejected favor win-lose, game started, one winner. best guess money vitamin-d. cheap cant patented. Damn. must diffucult winter times. Good luck bro. Unfortunately, live small city. work largest vendor industry, many people living major spots like LA, Nashville, Chicago, NYC, work going crew need fly get jobs.  


It's depressing stressful sure, anticipate least *some* work next year. nearly year-long global tour lined year, I'm sure. feel like I'm starting see glimmer hope horizon. Zeneca block say various dosing? election according lots commenters saw. Check similar stat state. really worried. 

As person risk vulnerable groups I'm going way back queue vaccination.
By time turn think around mid 2021 negative effects many vaccines well known. im sayin lied, small sample werent challenging trials. infections vaccine group percentage would go drastically. obviously big incentive go public create buzz 50dollar vaccines... didn’t get scholarship student loans cancelled Cool respond jail...you’re stretching definition word P-value super super low, seems suggest probability Null Hypothesis (the vaccine anything) disproven due random sampling error. propose? There’s warnings months exactly this. There’s crazy spike past couple weeks. There’s way people didn’t see coming, yet, they’re still choosing put many others risk.  *Cries American* Sign may true insult me. Way different time, think - sadly. 

This day age internet made way easy find (mis)information corroborates world view. 

As others said...you hear ""hE tOoK SaLinE dOsE!1!! LoOk ArtiCle billgates5gchip dot com!!1!1"" MURICA! know people gonna think bad vaccine, especially moderna Pfizer hype 90% efficacy listen think better vaccine 3.

1. safety, even though efficacy 70%, none contacted virus severe cases require hospitalisation. say even though vaccine provide full immunisation virus, provided enough initial immunisation body fight virus, compared without vaccine. means unlucky 70% contacted virus, chances asymptomatic require medical attention.

2. cost, vaccine reported 10 times cheaper compared moderna Pfizer ones(reported around $20-$27). means poor developing countries afford them! important huge chunk worlds population living developing country. made possible Oxford pledge non-profit WHOLE course pandemic.

3. talk availability, Oxfords vaccine much simple manufacture claimed already supply chain provide 3 billion dosages vaccine. sufficient vaccinate 1.5 billion people, 20% worlds population fraction cost compared 2 candidates. Also, Oxford one doesn’t require ultra cold freezer storage. vaccine also made anywhere around world require ultra high tech equipments. remember studies vitamin beginning CoVid, weren’t aggressively studied like everything else now? vast majority covid positive republican....

...until people working freezers re-ignite rampant community spread You’ll actual blood either way, actually.

Almost like need larger, cohesive government larger cash flow help prevent economic pain times see herd immunity really work since Dakotas aren’t anything mitigate from, mind asking? Pakistan, people like well.  friends. forgot obvious one. Lol, progressives funny. Dems promise moon every time fall it. somehow, think, ""Next time, they'll listen us."" played hahahaha variation, describes two different dosing regimes. Please read. Every one qualifiers failed state true US. Chronic violence, corruption, deteriorating infrastructure. making point us. likely like normal flu seasonal. reason gotten hit hard entire year brand new one built sort immunity yet. 

From I've read, get flu covid shots. making shit scientist idea work. Shut fuck up.

FOOD contains modified DNA moron. things genetically modified contain RNA mean they're dangerous. RNA vaccines work injecting viral sequence codes antigen, cells read produce actual antigen without needing infected virus. RNA degrades immune response antigen persists. RNA integrate host genome: RNA body uses short term produce proteins (that's called messenger RNA, carries message translate DNA proteins) last long cells. Degradation important feature DNA/RNA: means body regulate much particular protein made short period time amp reduce protein expression needed. RNA stuck around ages would possible finely regulate protein expression way body currently does. Therefore, RNA vaccines undergoing process degradation every stand RNA body undergoes. chance RNA somehow incorporate DNA strand, work like that. RNA vaccines sound scary reality exploiting incredibly predictable pathway body safer many older vaccines. Yeah. Death negative side effect virus. obviously better alive dead, knows long term issues going bring everyone infected. Early mid-December UK. talking NHS rollout plans yesterday concluded data proposed meant AstraZeneca's vaccine effective would available December. reading comments bunch YT videos. Unreal many people believe illogical conspiracy theories. mean indeed conspiracies proven true, like 90 percent load BS. ones involving coronavirus BS get. One step closer sub finally redundant. Seem recovering fine without US, US seem Chinese goods fine however many dead per day.

Sure cooperation would make everyone's lives better, lets pretend A) China needs anywhere much US, B) China forget shit US currently still harm China. Every single medicine earth, including paracetamol ibuprofen, side effects. vaccines gone rigorous safety testing treatments earth. side effects paracetamol likely severe vaccines. ridiculous read bullshit Facebook them. Grow up. 99% people cought perfectly fine, scared february mad justtheflu bros, nation wide lockdowns know theese numbers, pathetic... think Black Friday much issue.

said profit retail entities Great thanks. Since I’m lazy read whole article (it’s cake day :D!), specifically mention doesn’t stop virus? national healthcare worker strike order. number one person.... entire family, groups friends, entire lifelong connections

So true. hospitalization figure also represents team doctors, nurses, healthcare professionals another case piled already overflowing plates.

The numbers huge, like said, imply much one Even true, would still result vaccines faster every company government ability make knew so, 'recipe' speak known. people working would move things along, dispute that? It’s really 90% effectiveness headline news, editors article aren’t job. Feel pain &lt;fist bump live sports tv 

I specific contacts you...but tried looking television crewers (at least) work utility? I'm sure tough nut crack/break into...but...TV still happening, COVID procedures - actually hurting people. Yeah, primary issues year absolutely won’t go, won’t care virus want throw anyways, get peer pressure coming second persons dinner originally considered going all. people like type 2 what’s going make things much worse mid-December emergency approval front-line workers.

The gen pop vaccinated full approval given, expected April earliest.

[What emergency use COVID-19 vaccine good APNews overview situation. Here’s relevant October, FDA officials told vaccine makers two months safety follow-up half people enrolled studies requesting emergency authorization. data expected enough FDA allow vaccinations certain high-risk groups, front-line health workers nursing home Full approval vaccine likely require six months safety follow-up well extensive inspections company manufacturing sites. leading vaccine makers expected complete process next spring summer. FDA expected grant full approval, would allow vaccinations general population.

I’m sure got downvoted. I’m presenting facts quite carefully.

It’s important understand emergency use approval isn’t approval gen pop access vaccinations. It’s great thing! going stop deaths among gen pop. get medical advice YouTube doctor? That’s hard no. average person going exposed high titer virus like infectious disease doctor may around covid patients day Uh oh. private ones.  still everything right STILL GET INFECTED. fun dying alone room alone miserable. One major differences Republican Democratic policy Republicans would deny benefits 1000 families prevent one fraudulent claim. Democrats would rather allow one fraudulent claim means 1000 people need benefit get it.

The philosophy applies voting everything else benefits people.  Today's low number may due weekend effect. However, number already began decrease yesterday, government raise social distancing level tomorrow, worrying worst.

So also hope numbers go soon. depends type riding doing! riding group, people competitive, high HR spikes common. triathlon vs clock, smooth consistent best. 

The max HR young men able hit around 200 210 20s, declines age. (Not sure range women). spiking 195 close max HR. level effort sustainable long time, ""red zone"" spike builds exhaust muscles. training Ironman, long race really careful managing output. 

Sometimes unavoidable, lowest gear road gets super steep, time manage HR target zone. Looking back training program (its years since last raced) usually 120- 160bpm. mostly around 135/145bpm range. 

One thing mention HR - fit get ""elastic"" HR get. Basically body able respond increased effort ramping HR really high, recovers moderate HR quickly. woah - masses havent vaccine yet. Well see happens happens. Good news? Yep. im big mouth bass. plan die young need save retirement Yikes Well lovely Northeast Florida you. believe earlier year people driving Florida stopped certain entry points asked quarantine 14 days less stay less 14 days. simple test: ask ""Who's pres!dent el#ct? Come on, *whooooo's pres!dent el#ct?""

The anti m@skers able bring give correct answer, sent home treatment. It’s Sunday Thanksgiving. wish exception. Prison guards mot first responders. literally last responders. tests reported September 4th? two months ago?

Yup. tests expire december\~January. found key realize things bad compare Black Death pandemic Genghis Khan days I’m really going argue US February. It’s relevant much bigger issues. would enforce this? listen months stop selfish cunt? UK government announce Monday self-isolation longer required come contact people tested positive COVID-19, Telegraph Contacts test positive asked undergo daily tests seven days, allowed go business meantime, newspaper Ministers say current system requiring people stay home 14 days dismantled nationwide January, pilot schemes succeed, according newspaper. FYI 1.39 million people Earth died virus. hardly qualifies “nothing.” 

1.39 million almost 8000 million rounding wear mask socially distance things go back normal faster. Downplaying pandemic prolongs it.

Wrong. soon enough people stop complying pointless restrictions that's it. That's fastest way this. 75% people decide tomorrow lockdown narrative fall apart. apologies. meant ""you"" ""all people currently booking cruises"". you, yourself. LOL. literally millions snowbirds NY elsewhere moving (FL) permanently. without people like afraid shadow. Dork. live rural area. Doctors come afternoon check patients go home. night one doctor whole hospital. RNs mostly run hospital. critical care doc ICU. RNs call ER doc shit hits fan. go labor middle night nurse call OBGYN come in. 

So many people realize bad lack doctors rural areas. time vaccinated freight workers high risk workers- way out. six months placebo group infected 0.6% rate 10% rate. going use rate use rate. 

This RCT. Effectiveness go down. RCTs measure efficacy. Hopefully social distancing well. Yeah cutting anyone life supports nonsense, can't claim good person touted hating *flips notes* lending helping hand rapid tests less accurate, exposed family around. earth would around someone tested day? mean, sure look words. pictures worth 1000 however. prohibitive fines would offset profits businesses willing endanger public health. dense it? thought could get away it, said. wrong.

Blows mind every time. capitalistic, for-profit everything country, really, really makes despise it. hope never go shit like this. context matter herd immunity regarded like said, fucking stupid without virus. Hence point.  flu shot one dose, before. first time supposed go back get booster. One step closer solving overpopulation.  ""How die hoax lawl denied""

Maybe missing something concur least you’re admitting formed opinion without looking facts, picture. Please, you’re ever selected jury duty think conversation ask excused. cases caused indoor dining? LOL wrong again. still seem confused, CHOICE work hospital, anyone else’s. 92 percent gain immunity within first month first shot recommend reposting question r/COVID19. It’s strictly science based version sub. strict moderation keep conversation purely scientific rest us soon nope. “a virgin Cuba Libre, hold lime” clearly havent seen horrific images countries like France, Italy, UK,etc

This pandemic hit many health systems hard. never said scared ok lol. gotta take precautions normal cases surging time around, doubt believe first. They're likely spreading it. 

And gotta get 'em Facebook does. whole thing nothing serial killing meme. incredibly glad immediate family page precautions distancing. feel bad people deal COVID deniers families. 

Also, first time I'm thankful grandparents already passed suffer fucking pandemic - inconsiderate family members putting lives risk, keep extreme precautions preexisting health issues, dealing isolation loneliness. fucked feel thankful important people life already passed, are. We’ll way past winter average American get vaccine.

Plus takes one month 2nd jab get immunity. 6 7 weeks 1st jab

Late summer see R0 drop noticeably. 

Even front line workers get first jab January won’t immune late Feb/March here, AP stat offering I’m glad took it. definitely wasn’t encouraged counselors actually rather difficult course. high school AP stat class tougher Stat 201 class undergrad, go figure. heart attacks, strokes, cancer treatments, poisonings, shootings. miss anything? ordered online pick nearby restaurant I'd never last night, arrived, found much like bar restaurant. Plenty people there, drinking hanging out. even 21st birthday party progress. felt endangered I've year, course order 15 minutes past pick time, got soak stupidity extra long time. get people. Yeah, mostly rightist buzzterm decry anything good done people.

Things like open-source projects pretty much definitive proof issue. politics. u read sign walked in? ""But number still 42 per cent number passengers screened [this weekend last year].""

So, flights 58% weekend compared last year. 

Look, know bad people still traveling US, whenever see number, compare something meaningful. 

Our government worried airline industry much worried virus. Many states telling people travel, federal government's radiologist Dr Atlas said skipping Thanksgiving crazy still get together. wants everyone get virus.

It worth freedom people actually influencing lot young dumb people think okay party pandemic. started Instagram call @influencers_spreading_covid need know wrong think it’s okay put us risk make pandemic drag even longer biggest problem right is, schools arent closed. Otherwise lockdown would lot effective.

It Germany. Partial Lockdown, schools open. Covid Cases drop. ...and yet 2 weeks ago, copied/pasted exact comment 3 times post People sick lockdown. blame them, especially young people. age partying least 3 times week taken away would've drivin insane real quick.

Unless something dramatic changes mindset country, hope. 2 million weeks, 15k deaths, 100K hospitalized on. Still 100% masks. Business usual places. Numbers mean anything anymore. Good one. I'm kind loop happened Oxford vaccine ?? closer trials?? Publix shop cistomers give zero fucks calling someone type behavior line. saw poor asshole getting bitched multiple women produce section wasnt wearing mask. Clueless idiot didnt see big deal. Signs doors. 
Now Florida step up, announcing masks strongly advised interstate signs arrival signs airports. Hey, saw comment thought I'd offer encouragement. 

What posters saying unfortunately true- degree. got hit ground running ASAP situation avoid waiting around responses sucking resources dry. Apply help soon able. sponsoring visa? so, help navigate U.S. healthcare system, get physical ASAP determine level disability.

On bad side, American veterans spent multiple tours overseas gotten disabled wait **years** disability diagnosis. easy you, make mistake. need begin research best path forward even thinking booking ticket here, cause nothing get *then* applying medical disability benefits result much time waiting using SOs savings supporting you. I've seen relationships sour one half becoming resentful contributing team, person. 

Do friends here? support network help? vehicle lined up? insurance? sure coming from, U.S. healthcare system bankrupt time insurance, medicaid/care, disability help pay medical expenses. cruel, sooner expect this, better be. 

All said, welcome you! us friendly, social people good bad time. least I'd like think so. get armor together wits you, learn systems booking ticket over.

Best luck! Since must eat restaurant avoid dying? Get take eat house/tent/car/park bench!

Edit: waaaait minute... silly willy? semi regular runner this, I’m pretty nervous returning sport. Take slow, I’m going push PCP get good cardio workup can. don’t think it’s relevant there’s half percentage difference infection rates placebo vaccine?

My point looking raw infection rates group do, ""percentage point difference"" two groups grow group exposed virus. group exposed virus expect happen time. 

In limit entire population exposed, extrapolating current rates, one might suppose 0% placebo group would Covid-free, 93.3% immunization group would Covid-free. ""half percentage difference infection rates"" would grow 93%. makes percentage points odd metric use. either. No, fuck this. people idiots, monsters, both. 

They made example of. act like this, make family sick we'll hate you, too. Hope homeboy good insurance both, yikes.  get that, know we're lucky much family close by. everyone that. also makes even important nix big gatherings traveling year safe. I'm sure find something works family though. I’m glad I’m one three outbreak monkeys call friends. Lol good luck covid dude. Try walk incubation chamber apartment. vitamin supposedly helps. 911 again, first responders denied health care front lines I’d also add 18 hour flight according article. Consider indoor environment could 18 hours people get COVID?

Healthcare workers closest comparison likely better PPE (and better fitted PPE) still get COVID.

So, I’d say 4 people catching flight pretty damn good, comparison possible indoor comparisons. Outdoor events much safer. I'm lot skeptical indoor Halloween parties trick treating. going get horribly biased results posting here. RIP. bad hes around give sermons. fucking texas.

They're run un-empathic shitstains verge going full blown fascists. yes will. system must certain amount roadblocks many people making dishonest claims. It’s unfortunate legitimate claims buts it’s necessary evil time. Thats said originally. Yeah. Nah I'd say Trump administration CCP responsible, can't blame one need remember branch government controls funding. awful place ask. reason data polluted people typically concerned. worried would become slob pandemic tbh excuses go pub/restaurant use exercise bike least 6 days week 20 mins pop. Nothing amazing coupled occasional half-hour walk I'm lowest weight since teens. It’s judge’s fault interpreting / following law. It’s even insurance carriers fault. They’re shitty soul sucking jobs, assure excessively miserable. That's unemployment works, get food delivery I'm rich enough shift risk someone else.

No one cares rights. don’t think saw single person wearing mask last time Naples. Florida doesn’t care. step-sister family going travel see dad mom Thanksgiving. would two-household affair, five people, huge thing.

But husband got exposed COVID quarantine they're dinner home. 

(Which makes wonder many people get knowingly exposed think way go Thanksgiving anyway, end positive infecting others.) mostly younger people. I'd willing bet none die night out. anyone explain rationale? don’t understand change. always spend Thanksgiving alone due living far family, that's tradition too! Write cards, wrap presents, put tree, watch family-favorite holiday movie, etc. Helps still feel festive connected loved ones. :) someone lives LA lead bigger parties. could hang 6 max sky limit. Hell yeah great see humans humans again! Remember 9/11 first responders? got screwed. Uber eats offered 20 discount 40 groceries. I’m cheap anyone...to honest service issues. stock green onions? Ok. Charged wrong price 2 items, couldn’t get cs refund right amount see point view (they bananas advertised .03 yet charged .60 lb.)

I brought chicken breast cheaper drumsticks requested wasn’t charged less. also charged less paid beef 🤷‍♂️

You ability communicate shopper though option replace items similar even “oh forgot add this, grab it”

The prices pretty similar see store, charge 10% service fee plus 4.00 delivery basically even 20 coupon little cheaper would paid get items myself. course tip workers, hey least it’s option...Publix much better experience though, even Walmart new program get free day delivery $35 order haven’t really dove one yet pay fee similar prime one people wear mask car yourself, tell. super paranoid weirdo type. think I’m heated that’s hilarious I’m not. one getting heated someone internet chose hang 3 people pandemic. 3 people. Lol. Imagine paranoid freak like man. worst part dynamic situation is. Case numbers rising everywhere, simultaneously. Hospital capacity reached yet, locations hit capacity fewer options remain transfer patients overloaded hospitals remaining slack capacity. 

Pretty soon, many regions, simply option move patient requiring urgent care another hospital. mortality rates explode. really going argue US February

Why not?

Is wrong call U.S. fuck up? Hold accountable?  know everyone’s first instinct say “What morons! would this?” consider even today, thousands thousands people stood line hours get tested think test negative today, means safe travel Thanksgiving. course negative test today means negative today, people false sense security. Since coordinated response situation government (at least US) authority, lots people *still* don’t fully understand virus works, steps need take protect themselves. Bad information = bad decisions.

I’ve conversation mom, intelligent reasonable person, loves cruising, spend days reading COVID news like do. cruise lines say going put measures place make safe, believes them. say going require testing boarding, assumes sufficient. explain 14 day incubation, infected still test negative, would impossible maintain sufficient distance ship. broke would possible safe get ship, understood.

Perhaps government ever came consistent message-maybe form PSA, like one saw every ten minutes month vote mail- things like incubation time, infection rates, negative test means, maybe people could make better decisions. lot people blatantly ignoring rules, I’m denying that, people might make better choices better information. won’t lol agree. make sound serious (as be) making min three weeks, make sound like joke starting three days love kind statement accepted around here. People like, ""experts say vaccine available everyone April, think actually available everyone 2025."" r/iamverysmart also failing grasp fact infection spreads, people get sick, people go hospital, hospital ICU beds get taken up, people die. manageable circumstances, death rate around 1%. heading *unmanageable* circumstances. *That's. whole. POINT!*

And would challenge you, personally, stay fuck away hospital get sick can't breathe. Forfeit hospital bed someone less dense. offense isn’t Canada timeline? Japan? Lmfao ""recently"" Avg California 49.37 / hr RN including overtime Holiday. Cali Rns hit 130-140k Annually.

That cost living high there. majority RNs make six figures. Also, travel nurses nurses work lots overtime make 6 figures. make much. ?? agree ? 

Uhh care saying nurses make 2x civil / mechanical engineers make.

That complete lie. 4 person Thanksgiving dinner outdoor restaurant turned 12 person private party, cases going go Well put money safe investment accrue intrest pay people need would free time.

Don't want sense accomplishment overcoming challenges nonsensical system. think veterans feel much happier receiving heart medication years legal arguments.  think gonna read this. Come on! it’s not. I’m ready vaccine government already concerned started paying take shot many people would become even suspicious. suspect adjacent countries reporting correctly general rest southern Europe(Italy, Spain, France) even worse. sorry loss
JAILERS FIRST RESPONDERS dont something stupid, people did. mom choice, reason caught cause someone fucked up. virus doesnt appear. always source. people partying going taking risks dont responsible virus spreading to. mom sick cause asshat hospital decided special. know why, that's way happens. Someone sloppy cost mother. Evil demonrats using COVID poison TRUE PATRIOTS MIND CONTROL SOROS CHIPS





/s /r/conspiracy Texas shithole, glad left. Yeah, thumbs you’re really worth time talk to.

But I’ll say this. health responsibility, much like mine isn’t yours.

I stayed home months. Sacrificed financially, mentally otherwise. I’m weighing risks do.

I’ll gladly wear mask I’m grocery shopping. I’ll gladly stand social distance line post office. I’ll gladly follow every gym restaurant guideline, I’m sitting home pretending thing kill ... won’t.

If you’re afraid kill family. friends afraid kill family. make whatever arrangements need make stay away people.

Don’t expect everyone though.

I’m done now. Say something else pretend got last word smart. Gavin's forced 10 people next dinner party. He's hurting too, please nice Hopefully five year old someone else life learn empathy compassion from. Maybe get lucky cruelty skips generation.  Every single precaution would include quarantining two weeks beforehand, getting tested close day gathering possible, get together everyone socially distanced properly masked (ideally face shields too), frequent hand washing, properly ventilating venue either opening windows enough air purifiers running space. quarantine event.

I severely doubt that. I'm going anything Thanksgiving also plan spend money black friday. family almost never does. crap really need anyway. 

Don't assume things. makes look foolish. Republican. Riding river Styx (Reuters) - Australia's two populous states reopened borders Monday four months, Victoria stamped second coronavirus wave, raising prospects quicker return normal speedy economic recovery.

New South Wales Victoria closed borders early July, first time century, contain COVID-19 outbreak Melbourne, Victoria's capital city. borders last shut 1919 Spanish flu pandemic. healthcare worker, wish die ventilator..... comments Mark words, ~~Easter~~ ~~Memorial Day~~ ~~4th July~~ ~~Labor Day~~ ~~Halloween~~ Thanksgiving mass casualty event!!! Funding vaccinations everyone go Congress. That's McConnell Trump Biden. That's airline-funded studies want think There’s reports people hospital ICU Covid say it’s hoax. wish could deny treatment, would spread it. That's whole point - many quitting number cases pushing people beyond limit. quitting due exhaustion illness. take places. idea hospital looks like staff? horror show. People die dehydration, infections, electrolyte imbalances 2 days, long Covid takes them. Well guess lot studies sub studies could one interested people already .. probably asymptomatic people might get want see react it? could one like It’s good. Yeah fatigue people never bothered trying right thing first place. see people walking around grocery store mask hitting bars weekend complaining covid fatigue. Give break. State this? Generally point claim ALJ cancel interview. adjuster stand-in interview employer insurance lawyer ? post reads like came edgy kid still grade school. 

Wear mask. It’s hard. don’t solve global warming international humanitarian crises. wear cloth face may avoid killing someone’s grandma.  It’s hard. don’t want you’ve convinced don’t anything it’s gonna solve entirely human suffering one simple step. 

You break lazy, thinking you’ve found philosophical panacea excuses lack action, projects failures help world around mistakenly assuming everyone behaves you. dad pissed wife coming over.

If father, I'd make lack visitations permanent this. would, costs thousands dollars per month acquire medications. also said current infection rate continues referencing past influencing future.

Regardless, don’t think it’s relevant there’s half percentage difference infection rates placebo vaccine? amount trained medical personnel still believe nothing staggering. Uhh ?? agree ? outside Software engineering nurses make 2x civil / mechanical engineers make.

Avg California 49.37 / hr RN including overtime Holiday. Cali Rns hit 130-140k Annually.

Most mechanical / Civil engineers know 70-85k top 150-200k make partner one like 100. people stop money buy groceries, bad economy? everyone needed use directly groceries either spent items months long deep freeze appliance shortage. people spend money, keeps people employed. Thats stimulus. There’s big difference “I’m tough situation” “I future.” OP said latter. That’s simply untrue. fair, partner still making (small) turkey year two us. We’re planning legendary portions leftovers. think lot others same. Yeah. tsunami good comparison. One happened different parts world, every time rest world would watch horror, announce “but could never happen here, nothing worry about” needs stop, virus...hospitals empty. Stop trying throw everyone’s freedoms want live real life drama. ok thing before, now.

Hope insurance enough hospitals take in! reminds 9/11 flight attendants ""double indemnity"" life insurance clauses voided attack considered act war. Looks like sleazy used car salesman good site somewhere takes common denier narratives? Like ""it's flu"" ""look Sweden, they're great"", etc.? Yeah probably we're hell long way Anti maskers special level stupid, “I’m special things know shouldn’t I’m otherwise good” almost dangerous. LA trending well month so. Damn. Well that's fucked caught via work. 

Reminiscent 9/11 first responders life long health issue battle. live hurricane county. tell people, would skip driving New Orleans week they’re get hurricane, use risk calculation here. Save big gatherings next year. Woooh less half time grandpas dead 15 years wish area rate low... sarcasm. Good see people enjoying life I'm physician upmost respect admiration first responders Texas. worker's comp system heavily weighted employee, opinion/experience... giving benefits first responders contract COVID jobs no-brainer. long account data likely find compliance location population large that’s good. sub probably made monopolize censorship anyone else could . Sounds nuts first time. internet knew changing

What would wanted control narrative?

Could also plain old cognitive dissonance , many worldviews challenged lately Yeah there's enough people picture statistically likely one survive (assuming whole bar caught it). get disability married. financial support spouse, 100% happen. bigger picture probably industrial farming animals treated general. Covid20 doesnt change obscene. Also? Mitch McConnell trying push skinny covid19 relief employers pay employees contract covid job.  places you’re taking likely close point. It’s sustainable. going say, must American thing 🤷‍♀️ know, make people live without tips? What's right thing? Allowing dining rooms remain open? Yea, makes sense. US obviously suffering.

But exactly China missing working US closely? fact say completely unironically hilarious. Oh man, hate people don’t catch obvious sarcasm. Lmao would hate someone didn’t catch obvious sarcasm front me. I'd rather 10 people mooch taxpayer money one deserving person go without. Cases rise. start care 1:500? 1:100? parents grandparents? work SC hospital system part prove beyond shadow doubt caught covid patient co-worker covered workers comp. part hard since contact outside world blame that. Half country settle worse society burns people like worse them. Standard math courses high school 9th 12th grade pre-algebra, algebra 1, geometry, algebra 2. Statistics elective calculus AP course. went school one worst states education time. tested quarantined better us early on. I’ve learned people anything let them. don’t think. assume it’s open, it’s go. _They_ won’t experience bad thing. they’re shocked do.

There bad ice storm home town several years ago. sister worked mall. mall never closes. didn’t—until late. highways already shut closed. long open, _people kept coming_. Many couldn’t get home stranded ice.  Moderna's vaccine [doesn't actually require extreme -- remains ""stable -20° C (-4°F) six months, refrigerated conditions 30 days room temperature 12 hours.""  You’ll blood hands don’t.    flew florida pennsylvania 30 bucks. costs 25 dollars per night stay dorm January 19th. Wtf else supposed guys bright bulbs lighting way well cha? folks know quit insurance jobs soon got door. certainly pin blame anyone sticks out. know folks need jobs pay enough hurt others. parents obsessed collapse society nearly 15 years now. honestly seem want happen. That’s cute many believe little fraud there. Removing barriers fraud exponentially increase amount people taking advantage system. 

Have seen many people taken advantage COVID handouts year? big businesses scamming PPP handouts individuals filing fraudulent UI claims it’s huge waste money really, go bankrupt. sure places NY we’ve told months get tested matter feel. I’ve gone get tested multiple times feeling fine. lets find cliff put sign saying ""This way prove earth flat"" solve anti-vaxxer problem. getting vaccinated May dude. Family everything. 

It doubt is. best interest stay away. could either missed holiday season many enjoyable years one know it, ... last holiday season one family members. us, make right decision. 1. That’s data I’ve gathered far proves 2. isn’t place I’ve gotten participants Yeah sure people cannot sent almost mandatory. I'm homeless Yeah already ahead article calculated :( though point 2k deaths per day article 7-day moving average. 7-day moving average currently ~1550 (due weekend dip). rate we’ll week Fuck them, zero sympathy. Sucks kids got though. Well mean it’s good we’re better states zoom school fucking sucks

id rather take chances corona atp Spreading deadly disease thousands millions people seems like American way recognize Thanksgiving. We've come full circle! Fuck Sinclair broadcasting. issue people seem understand hospitals overrun COVID patients, beds staff people heart attacks, strokes, car accidents, etc. People die otherwise would not, even die COVID. Whether deaths 'counted' COVID deaths really matter. They'll still dead. includes senior living employees well think everyone option dude. us seriously fucked Time exposure + ventilation key. I'd take 1.5 hour plane 30 hours train day.

If manage keep mask entire trip (home airport, security, boarding, airport destination) okayish. flying safer area least.

Driving would ok well. isn’t place getting results know sucks, it’s grandpa lockdowns worth it? Joe Biden literally give shit. Whatever debt forgiveness rolls available behind wall severe, blanket means testing. anti-maskers going become anti-vaxxers. Oh yea baby!!

Show money!! Thankfully Murphy right thing Also China food self sufficient. China can't import food people start starve. shit, Sherlock. Curbside baby. hope curbside sticks around permanently over, love it. I’m eastern PA. pains see guys suffer way are. remember y’all getting hit hard northeast back April. It’s unrelenting y’all ever since. least enjoyed low case counts summer. husband didn’t change much day day regardless case counts nice knowing spread mitigated degree here. sars-cov-2 mutate like influenza virus. much larger proof reading genes prevent mutations. size means mutation occur less likely function. small virus lean genome every nucleotide counts greater chance mutation changes function (sometimes making non functional). large genomes many mutations anything. FWB turned plandemic conspiracist :( Protip - run TP, always use shower! *doesn’t catch obvious sarcasm* it’s insane either way. shut outdoor dining LA. sucks. i’m server. hopefully we’re able curb spread now. feeling it’s late they’re shutting travel, don’t know effective closing outdoor dining be. sure getting downvoted... loss inventory crazy hit top slashed sales. Lots people say things like ""only old unhealthy people never death anyways die covid"". last line preemptive defense untrue claims. gonna drive 17 hours home? Btw car guys ever see movie ... four weddings funeral?  Covid restrictions?? restrictions?? Aside virtue signaling, actually point make? Let's interview together present interviews equally valid. I’m pretty sure grandpa cremated $500. Either got best deal turned ash Tony’s pizza oven. No, actually correct. true influenza, SARS CoV2. asymptomatic presymptomatic person infect people easily first 5 days coughing, sneezing person Day 10. I’m stupid. state doesn’t allow wrestling, meanwhile almost every state currently wrestling. states kids get fucked? goes every youth athletic event. Guess what? Closed state residents flock open states fun, meanwhile you’re basement thinking you’re saving lives reality losing own. don’t fly commercial holidays you’re going homeless ? whole family getting together I’m asshole telling no. “It could Grandmommies last thanksgiving”. well stupid fucks, probably infect 86 year old grandmother deadly virus. don’t know I’m going grandma gets sick. Remember Florida data scientist fired refusing manipulate data? Aslo trump's administration hiding truth, making data speading misleading info covid everyday. Collaboration requires countries provide truthful data info. though, guilty got caught, guilty didn’t catch it, fuck hypothesis abuse victims abuse perpetrators randomly distributed among genders? hypothesis, fact. Every abusive incident real damaging. fact overwhelming majority victims women mean experiences abused man invalid. damaging pretend gender role here. fucked prisoner slave workforce hauling bodies. one thinks they're problem.

It's toilet paper problem. ""I'll buy pack two make sure one since hear people panic buying."" Multiply everyone else visits store, toilet paper gone. asked (very busy successful) workers compensation lawyer many clients’ claims denied insurance companies. said “all them.” deny many possible whatever grounds can, even it’s illegal so. Doesn’t matter. Insurance companies really don’t give fuck; see money, people. statistics many people actually get long lasting effects? There's history bad vaccines. think prudent wait while. want get right away fine means go it. Personally, I'd like wait hopefully turn correct may want study up, gonna age like milk You’re aware hospitals literally falling apart 250,000 dead right ? Probably twice unaccounted 

Please explain hospitals full nothing ? what’s like awfully wrong like time Big difference protesting outside summer masks celebrating pub, dude. one, one shown cause spike infections. Everything indeed bigger Texas - including level utter contempt front line workers. You’re objectively wrong asymptomatic people high chance spreading virus people close, prolonged contact with. clear one mindless drones sub eats confirmation bias propaganda make seem smarter talked owner restaurant nashville actually sales *increase* May. put signs every nearby apartment building curbside pickup. plus good food enough survive. stated publically: ""We offer public 10,000 locations"" Yeah, kind point: separate society infrastructure high low risk people feasible. were, low risk people could whatever wanted one would mind, provided try seek medical care get ill injured. 

I accept many people going catch unfortunately die. That's say everything close there's single case, rates exceed hospitals handle. everyone hung sauna whole thing would blown over! data showing outdoor dining causing increase cases? mean true open air setups. pretty well set up. seems like pointless restriction put place given Thanksgiving going destroy us anyway. even think given positions underpromise deliver, could sooner. 

People positions don’t want underdeliver. Voting Republican, practical sense, doesn’t help unless filthy rich. That's definitely feels inside hospital. Patients infected and/or suspected covid made maybe 10% work month ago, probably 50% more. Happy cake day! Great news!  Thanks, good idea. Outdoors alone magnitudes less indoors tons masks way distancing White House party rally. deserves politicized one side much worse masks distancing indoors. Nah, get essential workers sick unnecessarily. Calm forever bullshit too, vaccines already coming Hover hand master race Also indoor dining NJ already restricted he’s selfish, he’s going taking care get sick. bet he’d expect take care got sick make feel bad didn’t. I’m sorry dad way. right protect yourself. hope works out! Let's hope so. Seems like Texas state government trying bring much death possible make death painful possible everyone involved. Also think certain medical centers going try keep ICU beds open inevitable stroke/heart attack/etc. comes through, probably COVID patients die even though open bed dynamic. like hospital really function every single bed COVID patients. take ICU bed 3 weeks sometimes discharged die. That's far longer heart attack patients (of course know this, I'm saying). What's happening awful, since prison guards ""first responders""? We've gotta save government dollars *really* need it, like Raytheon. now, restaurants shut business pickup delivery. 
My dad restaurant. insane. F restaurants suppose now?
Fucking people dumb asS Made believe freedom. WEAR FUCKING MASK AVOIDABLE!! GET LAWYER

Do try deal state Office Risk Management without lawyer.

Lawyers help process upfront cost you. going even get vaccinated? curious people going stuff afterwards America's idea cooperation deal covid. would China, country matter, want cooperate United States? America publicly stated views China enemy. Chinese perspective, cooperating United States mean helping America hurt itself. good deal sake economy. better China reduce reliance United States developing new markets. all, Americans ones trying contain China, way around. welcome. see something worries though- mentioned fiance currently without work well? also immigrant without citizenship yet? 

Those two things alone- degree no- death knell here. stable income sizeable bank account balance fall back extended amount time here- don’t mean blunt, make it. go back moving here, make harder return future, mention wait longer if/when visa expires. 

I really hate say anything negative here, cause love see someone really walk fire better themselves, become stronger side, succeed. sounds like disabled comment, fiance without work must incredible insurance situation make it.

Again, encourage you. must plan sustain alone comes it. happens split whatever reason? forbid death decline health- situation life turned upside game-ender. 

My best advice *look possible negatives well this, good stuff*, play devil's advocate here, really try step look situation third party perspective. think could still make worse happens? Would advise someone care situation move here? emergency lifelines prepared? roof head means eat end alone?

If answer honestly, still confident could it- welcome U.S.A. Lmao country even let [you leave house exercise walk generally affects dumbasses wear masks. kind thinking perpetuates myth people got sick they're idiots followed zero precautions. makes people think ""I'm like them, I'm taking precautions, can't happen me""...which exactly problem.

It's possible took many precautions one person exposed work wearing mask, transmitted rest family decided make one exception party.

The take-away ""don't make exceptions no-gathering rule, matter safe being"", ""they're probably lying"". pandemic really shown everyone works healthcare we’re disposable cogs system. It’s depressing. get lip service sometimes mostly shamings wanting adequate staffing, access new ppe regularly (how manufactured used), wanting work 16s every day. Yup, that's take too. public health departments ensure establishments shut down.

I'm sick hearing ""my freedumbs"" ""my money"". Selfish people get bent. see, *not* telling nurses quit job constitutes virtue signaling. Well sure, virtue glad signal.

You want get it? Let's it. assert videos mentioned, showing situation Italian hospitals trusted. one example March: one week ago, showing one ICU bed left: saying doctors actors, making look worse is, patients faking symptoms? would tell five year old believe? Let's start there, find baseline debate. honestly think majority US population vaccine distributed weeks?

do even understand logistics involved? 2 doses full vac? availability? April would godsend. still planning going Nashville? Please say no, really don’t want ilk. Outdoors masks chump change spread compare reckless indoor maskless shit many doing. see CuriousShallot2 already explained want re-iterate feel like super dangerous summary, don’t want anyone like “what, don’t want part SARS-COV-2 injected me”

The vaccine helps body recognize virus’s envelope. It’s like received email said “click accept wire transfer” instead site stealing bank credentials explained “lol pls don’t click links emails, u get hacked” Uh Broward County? Cmon. 

This Trump, DeSantis whatever politician wanna blame week. People need get shit together. Rich people get home visits  Numbers actually never matter. unnecessary death singular Hey man, diss Tengri. Mongolia locked capital one community transmission. 1/5 size ""huge headache""? Right VA treats 7 million veterans. mean they'd get great care since would 1/50 size total population?

The US better actual metric like life expectancy, obesity, diabetes, infant mortality despite spending *way* healthcare.

I love ""source"" coworkers talking people something. coworkers care much better? really arguing people need healthcare ""basic needs""? basic need you? 

I personally know 2 Americans gone Mexico gastric bypass surgery costs prohibitive America. Republicans gonna republican. Yes, since that’s happening, ? immediately fix ?

Oh that’s right elected officials got dismissed senate. Thanks Kentucky ! I’m sure agree assessment. people believe Covid made worse wearing mask. believe it’s hoax real virus. I’d like think everyone knows could happen get (or spread it), really don’t believe everyone well informed. That’s problem put leaders, spread false information played damage does. Okay maybe prevent waves start vaccinating people? make people even skeptical. That’s Europe China did. Australia New Zealand stopped allowing international flights.

This December going something straight horror movie us. Someone ironically mentioned maskless assholes become anti-vaxxers. bourbon!! 
And....Louisville sluggers....
I’m sorry guys. buddy works hospital Duluth. words day: ""Everyone getting COVID."" Cheers, mate! big numbers need track hospitalizations we'll start run supplies room people really makes wonder treat family gone fuck even choose path life? I’m sure you’d rather take chances drunk driving too. Society says choice recklessly endangers lives don’t consent. What’s threshold taking seriously? Going walk, taking public transport, means thinking it’s hoax? YES YES WOULD!  Show one article someone pushed front subway. One. true gerrymandering similar shenanigans We're approaching four weeks Victoria without community transmission. think vaccine available CVS. requires special storage handling Yeah.. Irish guy watching across pond guys really stupid amount protesting celebrating streets pubs done year lot would fine year Earth pandemic happening you’ve played right it’s hands 🤦🏻‍♂️ GOP goddamned disgrace. crazy went bike rides get coffee Grove still first week COVID. Crazy old Brendan Schaub. Always stuff like laughs. Yes expect people stay home literally every holiday see sharp rise cases followed deaths people letting people bubble normally bubble. 

It's unreasonable expect people care lives others. Welp, US pretty much fucked. best protect loved ones; wear mask, social distance, get tested periodically. Suburban Philadelphia. 228 per 100k last week. around 40 summer. Living Australia, safely go watch sporting events eat dinner out, know grandparents prefer. second time CDC made broad pronouncement week. seems like Trump losing helped CDC find voice again. Cancer isn’t highly contagious. *looks 9/11 ""heroes"" getting fucking penny help medical care maybe 15 dead... 6 months.* Herd immunity vaccine herd immunity possible millions deaths. weird! Exactly this... it’s thing socialism/communist/republicans evenly Reddit/Twitter... Facebook (Democrats evil) Trump effect Twitter/Reddit Sanders effect

The people “minority” always scream loudest. Exactly. Repulicans treating doctors like shit doctors beforced treat republicans harming them. students moving residence halls. universities closed campus Friday, students need go home. lot trips impractical drive (20+ hours ways pick kid).

Most people traveling dumb dangerous, decent portion limited choice. 9/11 directly lead deaths amounting multiple times occured 9/11 innocent people country unrelated it. Wafflestomp response providers are defined term “emergency response providers” includes Federal, State, local governmental nongovernmental emergency public safety, fire, law enforcement, public safety telecommunicators/dispatcher, emergency response, emergency medical services providers (including hospital emergency facilities), related personnel, agencies,   Correct- virus. inert protein spikes resemble proteins virus generated ejected cells, immune system produces antibodies recognize spikes looks incoming viral particles. mRNA molecules actually degrade within 1-10 days inside cells. ""We're New York, worry."" actually heard this. got 12 hours notice lockdown south Australia, much food waste. lot western countries (THough IMO boobs thing arse backwards).

Thats reason. Australia/NZ behave completely differently similar ratings. 90%+ immunity holds up, there's reason think won't, give fuck backward bumpkins do. I'm born, raised live right middle it. hope go 4 funerals next year then. Thanksgiving event year (not huge, bigger I'd like) suspect certain half family never take shot. Fuck. Bryan Callen? Always loved him, hope isnt same. listen, one thing don’t half population actually try make worse political points. half opposite liberals want liberals. level idiocy really isn’t found population wide NZ. insane! unbelievable get worse. idea got information. stopped trial point death participant, quickly returned death nothing vaccine.  means restrictions personal safety tasks habits could cause deaths taken. paint rosy picture I've tried explain parents year, insist ""being careful..."" ok travel. shit - nobody like ""what I'm risky..."" Everyone thinks safe. 
 
And side - even everything perfectly, trust everyone risky contact everything perfectly, everyone risky contact everything perfectly. guess case though, everyone things perfectly, we'd done now. literally know assumption hold based ground truth. that, mere fact people willing risky contact you, suggests not, fact, things perfectly. Afterall, drink beer next mask off, means drink beer next another person mask off, also type person drink beer next someone mask off. on. 300k deaths. point, let young healthy get sick. protect old vulnerable vaccinations. hospitalisations fall off, release restrictions. Covid huge health crisis young even rare severe cases. Compared rest world, would say Americans poor. bizarre claim, very, privileged view world. Great news. not, I'll glad pay mine pay forward others too. Lmao Trump History books right now? really stupid think second something happens history book? government literally given timeline hes still managed take miserable outlook moderna/Pfizer trials get away that?

Some studies shown 20-80% covid cases asymptomatic. Surely trial results totally invalid?! I’m already seeing shit Twitter big cities Midwest maxed ICU beds, literally people getting rejected basically given morphine sent die. incredibly grim... completely avoidable. i've hotspot italy since beginning i've never stopped feel sorry u.s., pretty much tell badly expertise is? seems exactly occurring. seems plausible reason got better immunity rates (90% v. 62%) lower first dose. know, first reply made little sense thought maybe meant reply someone else. Little know follow steaming pile nonsense see above.

In nutshell, article states counties adhered statewide mask mandate saw reduction cases. provided link data one counties article referring shows cases drop, instead increased. whole basis article false, nearly identical story Kansas City Star newspaper August. article talk house parties get-togethers (or abortions) causing rises. Try reading it, maybe? click link provided?

Whatever do, please reply random word generator, hilarious! know someone rural area.. drive 'hospital go die at'... right city. 

I think might perception local care sub-par even dangerous times. I'm getting trial shot J&amp;J 2nd week December, control group worst fear honest. still lot people parrot 'correlation causation' every time, get, but.... long going toxicity levels, there's zero harm supplementing vitamin anyway. get objections.

1) taking Vit supplements months studies. That's because, said, might help hurt. I'm probably deficient anyway. 

2) however, true correlation equal causation, known sick causing lower vit levels. I've seen good evidence Vit helps COVID. 

Again, taking there's harm suggestion studies helps, still actually know. Gotcha, thanks explanation. makes sense. silly argument. 1) antibodies disappear infection over, supposed do, otherwise whole body weight would nothing antibodies. mild infections, disappear quickly, serious infections, hang around longer. indicator much threat body perceive virus be. 2) Antibody response COVID vaccines shown stronger longer lasting natural infections, suggesting vaccine effective getting immune system take virus seriously. See 3) Memory cells long term players immunity, manufacture antibodies quickly upon re-exposure, people circulation antibodies mean immunity. vaccine candidates effective eliciting memory cell response. look mutations Covid virus, ""mink mutation"" show altered antibody response, 15%, memory cell production affected all. Scientists specifically said expect mink mutation problem vaccine perspective. mutations impact effective antibody response. I'm disagreeing Medicaid expansion (lack thereof) caused hospitals close. closure hospitals reason many rural people currently big city hospitals due Covid. merely minor contributing factor. hospitalization rate per infected.

Indeed reading seem hard, you. !RemindMe 4 years doesn’t prevent COVID, part interesting: researchers provide proof showing mumps IgG titers, levels IgG antibody, inversely correlated severity recovered COVID-19 patients previously vaccinated MMR II vaccine produced Merck.  signed up. bit drive would worth science. funds

That's US specific limitation. Universities countries patent profit research, Oxford iOS famously US. link that? Food service jobs special requirements public health impact. I've heard outbreaks one hep B positive kitchen worker bare-handed salad prep hundreds people exposed. Testing fine. Mass interstate travel lax distancing problematic parts. states requiring visitors get negative tests entering state numbers would indicate people trying get tested comply mitigation measures.... tell us? claim moral high ground wagging finger everyone without worry pissing businesses. gave shot? local adult physicians carry it, neither pharmacy. people locally carried vaccine pediatricians, cannot treat adults state. option county heath department, insisted making bureaucratic chore. problem everyone going pay lack civic duty. It’s going cost us terms economy, grief families health care. Dysfunction never good society. interesting part: researchers provide proof showing mumps IgG titers, levels IgG antibody, inversely correlated severity recovered COVID-19 patients previously vaccinated MMR II vaccine produced Merck. They’ve already lived life, don’t fear covid guess isn’t surprising given coronaviruses species often enteric pathogens (not all, course). sounds like got Vax. Congrats! trial find sure not? shit it'll take Easter one talking multi-month lockdown March, either, happened. think we'll return ""normal"" quickly. hope summer.

You're right. Unsure downvoted. Nothing hate reading snappy intellectual-sounding buzzwords parroted place. Really moves Overton Window something something Schrodinger's Cat Slippery Slope Fallacy. Something tells lot people are/were ""brave"" wear mask terrified vaccine. easy tests available people access private care? can't wait ""Coronavirus eradicated"" news 2 3 years (maybe little more). can't wait stop wearing masks financially blackmailed

I love even *literal financial compensation reward helping end pandemic* viewed punishment everything government bad.

It hurts brain. Same. Also, things like commercials comic strips showing people wearing masks look current immediately recognizable future year (and next, probably, though suspect vaccine distribution underway, creative direction likely shift look antiquated). guy scared shitless vaccine. Look media consumes, surprised all. obviously ""extreme "" bothered read article. “Nazis” haven’t existed roughly 75 years. 

Prejudiced assholes? course exist.

I don’t like opinions, right hold opinions. right hold yours. don’t “hear out” don’t want to.

None even applies previous post.

I simply pointing hypocrisy people urge others compassionate, turn around shame, wish illness upon, celebrate someone gets sick / dies, didn’t agree them. Obviously made mistakes listening disease control authority probably right reaction. Also consider forgiving no-masters towards mistakes (ex-) president, sounds like cheap excuse me. Well business model kill animals profit. surprising. people won’t camps manage quarantine. It’s response fires, floods, war, etc. one pulling grandma home case messes quarantine talks mailman long. 

But grandma 3,000 neighbours move avoid threat far worse Covid, still mitigate risks somewhat, even inherently imperfect. Nevada's unemployment anything like states, probably want starve homeless. Last night watched Anti-vax episode Family Guy. 
I feel got useful information people get sources. American here, how’s effectiveness vaccine? So, mud hope, then. Maybe Wuhan... I’m sure. least state think big part issue lack enforcement rules especially winter coming. Restaurants guidelines don’t seem follow much. warm weather states 100% agree you’re saying New England outdoor dining isn’t going feasible soon mask mandates aren’t enforced indoor settings. YoY, passenger volume around 55-60% week. However, people considering is, almost ZERO international travel, accounts large percentage total volume last year. TSA can't provided YoY domestic travel bet much closer normal activity numbers show. agree, 1918 flu reached small towns years later far isolated. think there's county US without cases, 8 months first positive tests? 9 months?

And vaccine effective regardless geography. Anti-vax philosophies limited geography. True, want people around understand *we need hospital* sufficient actually cause happen. need something new talk about, coffee hour fellowship hall church. Thus far, seem think happen magic … click heels together three times repeating *we need hospital*. long ago get shot? getting vaccine ASAP. definitely wear mask whatever like now. I’m gonna weight lifted shoulders. Waiting CVS
to call. cases increasing decreasing Dakotas Iowa?

Why hard answer? Something wrong? full sending patients away turning away patients would normally hospitalized. don’t know people think collapsing healthcare system looks like. It’s building going explode something. It’s turn away people need care, giving subpar care getting care. CHP provides security governor. think project already exists called internet. “Well haven’t seen full hospitals clearly it’s government fabrication make us wear masks” uh ohhhhhh far actually know measurements played trial across nations. right. Stay denial needs emphasized. affects you.

A new covid infection endpoint.

It's endpoint, start point, mutation point. I’d pistol whipped called self defense. Every day sub paints darker picture me. apartment complex empty urban college town... really hope comments wrong. Cause plays like that, harder imagine everyone know making this. Covid aside, hospital chains built system. specifically build large central hospitals smaller hospitals chain out. whole point smaller hospitals send worst patients bigger hospitals.

It interesting though rural/urban dichotomy geographically seems match mask/no mask split. Vaccines free Americans 100 people LOL! live three blocks idea even happening. people Trader Joes morning. Completely agree, Guatemala sunbathing since March (as soon read vitamin D). 

Why spread across media news now? may miracle cure, saves couple lives would worth That’s fine, you’ll freedom go restaurants, pubs, etc., whenever want, too. Don’t confound issues spending preferences changed. officer kids table restaurant think people missing psychological effects means. Everyday stuff closing means it’s safe out. People start hopefully check complacent look behaviors. “Maybe stay home”

We can’t pretend fighting pandemic means get normal social life. need make bigger sacrifices take seriously again. I'm guessing pay attention fanta menace rally dc, 10k preexisting conditions hanging together. people think good estimate April May, that’s keep seeing lot. Head warp speed even came said May good. Safe != risk free Yes, sad helpful spread Covid-19 high able achieve statistically significant results much faster usual. I'm sure works validity trials, though. Yes Onward Covid20 subreddit Yep it’s not. Even link says it’s up. began month 5% slight 7%.

But Mayo Clinic clearly graph-

[Mayo already tried sledgehammer drive bulletproof glass last riots...That window got shattered pretty bad still held. mean unreasonable people want eye test general population make decision. Americans aren’t scientifically literate enough interpret 300 page report Pfizer. Honestly 95% sub isn’t either. bunch people start taking covid numbers go down, that’s test right there. overly optimistic thinking got vaccine everyone going get too. Im saying extend lockdowns. think open degree people actually took right precautions. dont part. assuming much beliefs im pretty certain know u stand for. know people think vaccine sketchy people willingly take it. ur gonna ur super conservative places opening completely soon vaccines come available even though huge majoirty people havnt taken it. live Texas practically open state arent good. ah, fellow democraticunderground.com member see, strange see shift well even long flipped maybe 2013-2014??? mean really, luck, preventative measures even important compliance, US commit lockdown even couple weeks everyone gave idea entirely

Even covid cases surge hospital beds fill, nearly everyone speak to, strangers, friends coworkers seem say things: ""it's bad say"" ""they're lying numbers"" ""it's never going away may well get it"" variation those.

Really sad see state rampantly misinformed egocentric people denounce distrust data matter legitimate fit narrative. really feel bad people choose get vaccinated? people refuse wear masks “taking away freedom” uncomfortable? clearly don’t feel bad people endanger. Like OP said, long everyone wants get vaccinated hospitals resources handle stupid people don’t get vaccinated... matter? Thanks! Luckily, neither us actually caught it, grounds lawsuit. fallen law safety precautions anyway. fiance exposed...which puts third party exposure worst. need stricter safety precautions. Honestly expect much lower par flu shot point city hospitals cities citizens trying best responsible follow rules refuse accept patients rural areas they’re actively protesting virus restrictions coughing other’s mouths fun

How saying that? said nothing beds, said nothing staff. said point hospitals say fuck people taking seriously time assuming every person rural areas covid deniers. Ty wondering! looks tired. Poor guy. problem directed people wear masks March, despite consensus countries easy obvious step. Rational people ignored wore anyway, people questioning everything say. can't gain back credibility easily fumble. end goal show people get vaccine still healthy. Question color would appropriate? think? Seems like many “taken”. Maybe red? tested positive covid, virus currently known resurgences months later, showing literal symptoms covid, common viruses applicable demographic, heaven forbid talk covid discussing her. thrown jail, isolation cell superspreader. sure you’re downvoted. It’s difference 50% effective vaccine virus mutates every year (flu), 94% effective vaccine virus barely mutates (measles, covid). I'm honestly burned whole thing celebrating, anyway. I'm also worried could spread people honestly trying hardest safe.

But yeah, sympathy. see nothing mentioning daily, words death toll, usually cumulative thing. actually taught statistics couple years grad school. want pm specific questions answer point right direction.

Larry goonick's ""cartoon guide statistics"" great intro book makes easy pick up. includes stories people came basics. 

Most testing used experiments actually simpler stuff. ""controlled"" experiment bunch things could explain difference outcomes see starts get complicated. I’m speaking general like article spoke general. Sure could go individual individual fruitless conversation hand. problem rural areas hit hard still refusing institute guidelines contain spread. rural folks abiding guidelines? Sure, majority **not**. clearly stated article brazenly apparent look current society. see nothing mentioning daily, words death toll, usually cumulative thing. great take assuage curiosity news compared successes vaccines. Thanks clarifying! shit becoming cliched. Stop gathering groups, stop acting like impervious it. depends. 

For risk, probably. 

For maybe not. HK$5000 US$650 nurses well. Nurses weird demographic seem polarized matter even though that’s horrifying it’s real would think Texas, Arizona Flordia would gone way down, people would outside fall months rates still winter, summer. I'm sorry taken toll mental health refreshingly honest psychopath What. senate! got sent home thanksgiving already. Whole week off. Good luck getting boomers go along that. (I don’t mean sound quite snarky might.) mitigation efforts implemented shit, IMO.  !remindme 1 year  Sorry saw now. excellent news. Strawman argument. didn’t say hospitals cuss patients don’t beds for...  considering wearing something (like various colored ribbons people wear different causes) indicate vaccinated maybe reassure worried vaccine safe.

I join you. it, care everyone else long impact me. ruggedly declined transfer. rural areas aggressively ant-mask anti-distamcing summer. time check cashed. Absolutely sickening even though saw happen months ago, plenty notice even Covid taken root US, yet we’re go shit winter think government would purchase 6 weeks food 330 million plus people? don’t factories farms know right? words people never learned China's experience Chinese New Year. Expect cheap christmas presents ebay, purchased never used Field hospitals guess. Turn large convention centers stadiums hospitals fill beds. China. Big question is, find enough healthcare workers work them? couldnt care less, inner circle thriving thats really matters. “We effect endorse them” talking policies made people hate us enough fly planes buildings. That’s exactly said. can’t spin “scholarly studies”, entirely said blame 9/11 exact quote mot even mention event. lacks empathy completely asinine. also say would go away like miracle. religious speak magic. 94-95%. appropriate term. high level efficacy vaccine, par vaccines diseases completely stopped worrying ages ago. Also, vaccine-induced herd immunity eliminate much cases efficacy implies. comparable flu vaccine situation.

The reason would linger anti-vaxxers. feel bad kids anyone can’t get vaccine due compromised immune system lives anti-vax community, anyone else. True, take good news get it. Could imangine Trump six seven million votes? I’m probably considered far left agree everything said. 

Name calling holier-than-thou attitudes either side hurting everyone.

Some people care ego actually solving problems. Cases peaked 7 days lockdown started Oct 30 going since. lot weird comments pushing island excuse. 

She's saying Hey Joe, here's tips. offered access health officials advisors, team people came perfect solution NZ. Sure, solution USA going require lot input totally different answer, understand hostility idea offered support waste US different. Pretty sure people referring well aware there's bigger diverse divided population less border control.. Mandatory quarantine testing: science fiction dystopia

Mass graves refrigerated vans: hallmark free society Still waiting fema camp shirt Jade Helm.  


/s LMAO 85% pharmaceutical companies corrupt scum world.   Idk fuck got graph thats literally [fake 20 deaths great statistic sweden considering number [daily deaths cause usually Death rate increasing

[Doesnt look like herd immunity false narrative? cant call science false disagree lmao totally right honestly think it’s one big reasons it’s become hard get people take virus seriously. People forced go work unsafe conditions they’re told it’s safe, they’re told that’s unsafe see family friends. virus spreads time, exchange money creates magic barrier prevents infection. It’s transparently bullshit totally undermines messaging needed stop spread. they're waiting see exactly long takes autoimmunity show occurs, frequency autoimmunity problems is. seems like they’re passing responsibility controlling outbreak individuals individual choices,” said Ellie Murray, epidemiologist Boston University. “A pandemic failure system failure individual similar narrative played September, universities shamed expelled students partying instead providing clear guidelines resources, Dr. Marcus way distracting harder public health work need do,” said — example, implementing mask mandates, addressing societal inequities ensuring enough personal protective equipment health care workers. Yes, dying cheap, thank you, rough year everyone. That's said though 70% believe trouble is, transmission rate much higher, even though death rate lower SARS MERS, sheer volume cases make likly death rate inflated. free stay home then. 

Don't try say stay home might get sick home. checked search terms “Covid symptoms” “Covid test” state USA whole didn’t really line well way cases spread. 

And believe opposite. Covid hasn’t able sustain 6-8 week rally time, anywhere, we’re coming now. percent positive tests already leveled last week even showed decrease today first time months. 

I used data call summer peak it’s aligning way now. Thanksgiving may result slower decrease numbers, suspect we’re summit peak start back end month. mean like hookworms rural Alabama? thought eradicated them. Generally considered third world problem longer tested internal parasites, raw sewage ground lack proper sanitation... poverty line still poor. Exactly. There's also residual effects virus. Police say 39-year-old filled form stating legitimate reason leave home like watching orcs.

Nailed it. 0 deaths acceptable. values profits lives?

Full lockdowns need instituted vaccine 100% rolled zero community cases worldwide 14 days. “Collapse “ isn’t defined. state medical personal overworked protected; nurses picketing safer conditions; ICUs full they’re using areas; patients wait admitted. 

It really sounds awful, say shame us anyone traveling thanksgiving. Experience shown that’s going big spreader event.

Stay safe, please great state Texas four refuse take vaccine protest closures mask mandates. mean problem Alex Jones saying vitamin helps insinuates covid fixed get sun/take pill. someone get covid doubt going outside help doesn’t protect entirely. 

Patients stay hydrated probably better COVID prognosis dehydrated. mean pandemic cured drink water? Well, least get cliffhanger December won’t wait long next season start. concern start. solidarity inside EU comes global pandemic, vaccinating one country solve global crisis. really hope others going same, otherwise Europe fucked. Amit-maskers: No. 

Rest us: Shit. bible educational material. Sunday numbers always low. Yep. guilty tone deaf here. feel like life experiences discounted boomer. Ah well. Thanks input.

I take experience account next time. Good job taking care moving forward. hope best you. Perhaps private healthcare better resolving issue like national healthcare. could implement higher premiums get vaccinated. I’m huge proponent vaccines think given nature quickly vaccine implemented I’d like see data safety efficacy first. don’t think that’s unreasonable.

How reasonable depends. leaving house unvaccinated time get vaccine? understand jokes? do? Lol can't even think that. radiologist trying intubate. Thank could always wear nijab... ""Take hilarious personality test..."" wife: handle alcohol, one beer, go tip 3 grand!!!  agree majority time definitely parrot parents say year March Believe not, lots countries earth handled crisis less month hard lockdowns central coordination less back normal. East Asia dominate next couple decades like US WW2. Yeah lol I'm little skeptical. anti-maskers would give bullshit excuse always said wear masks. Ah yes, misinformation That’s guys haven’t graduated “society” yet. You’re still pretty primitive, believing you’re independent individuals. 
The sad thing is, it’s impossible careful pretty much. food store went many provisions place keep people safe March nothing limit capacity, one front checking masks managers chitchatting non-mask wearers right front face. Even someone online without mask coughing fit 15 feet away me. 

It’s insane. feel walls closing family. least 38. scares quite frankly acute traumatic issue like car accident God bid type health issue kids need help beds doctors available. 

I mean states Midwest converting children’s hospitals extra ICU space 🎉😓 LOL! went shopping day yesterday Walmart Neighborhood Market Pasco, FL. 

Overheard woman phone shopped:

 ""All turkeys 14 pounds,"" whined. ""We'll try somewhere else."" *huff*

(I chuckled inwardly, I've shopped small birds last 17 years since marriage often involved going Thanksgiving relatives.) eat food prepared Publix even though shop there. B E U F U L

T E L N E noted states took international flights VIC didn’t deal incoming traveller quarantine, allowing deal local surge. states current cases quarantine, excepting currently Adelaide nipping outbreak right Stores closed earlier people needed extra time stock shelves. absolute agreement. system completely broken. 

I get jimmies rustled people without idea system works claim know fix it. 

Stay safe there. Informed citizens like kind society cannot afford lose. caught news home lol? country pretty much needs dismantled started again. fucked beyond repair. think entire thread NPCs I'll bet paid people get numbers would rise dramatically. 4/10 voted trump looks like spot Ah yes, misinformation  Lol. Kansas study found out? Kinda late pandemic, right? think even conservatives idea fuck Benghazzi even means anymore Yes, also changed. effective vaccines, yet. good deed goes unpunished. Gates's reward devoting fortune combating disease internationally. either  bartender hotel bar nyc, like 9 months Depression. BC. provincial health officer thinks worth using...  Completely different outcome definitions trial. always need read fine print :) Moderna/Pfizer Phase III verify efficacy \*getting\* COVID19 disease, Oxford vaccine Phase2/Phase3 testing immunogenicity getting infected SARS COV2 virus.

Those DIFFERENT outcomes, specially COVID19. Phase 3 Oxford vaccine US (I part it) also measuring getting COVID19 disease thus, PCR test done trial, get PCR unless actually get sick. Moderna Pfizer. ready bet come back, also see another claim 90-95% efficacy too.

Oxford also getting small subset volunteers weekly testing, looking infectivity effectiveness too. Neither Moderna Pfizer shown data yet.

This conjecture, expect Pfizer come top terms global efficacy, generates strong humoral (antibody) cell based (CD8+ killer cells) immune response... (its mRNA encodes binding protein instead whole S-protein). Moderna probably similar lower efficacy Oxford former nothing terms cells latter showed stimulation CD4 T-helpers (even booster anything there) TRAVEL work...and like said...I've working EVER. 

New COVID procedures schedule reshuffling means longer trips frequently. lot staff either fired, left due extended furlough periods...so less people work. 

I could handle lock down. could handle tests. could handle fear uncertainty. 

What *really struggling with* right now, feeling like escape work. went usually traveling 210-220 days year...to 280-290 day pace. HUGE change, really affecting me. 

I keep feel like constantly edge another shut down, want best prepared possible...that try make whole shutdown/furloughs. try keep chin complain much know MANY PEOPLE STRUGGLING....and total 1st world problem.

Thanks coming TED talk. grew NZ hippie circuit fucking hilarious depressing watching one love types passionately spreading q shit begining trump presidency rally racists neo Nazis chanting jewish people replace them. organization starts physical altercations Trump, proud boys, recently ousted leader saying longer pretend cause white identity nationalism. Trump fed fire muslim travel bans, painting south americans evil people, telling black congresspeople go back came from.

A lot people voting people actively vote. people always ashamed general public agree ideals. Trump gained 10 million votes 4 years losing support political party voters. people types listen reason. celebrating finally someone represent white house. kept away first place public shaming. telling can't publicly shame people, thats kept away first place.

We make shameful people prevent future generations becoming like them. Racial relations US become better overtime become shameful racist. Publicly shaming people works worked. want give platform treat equals. N quite low give statistically significant results. Like 400 low. People ridiculous Beginning year cancelled Disney world Orlando trip. Last week rebooked holiday mid July 2021. Fingers crossed 💪🏼 Looks like every day folks commuting LA county gather. California purging currently leadership end next election. union 😳 wtf Erm... Greece Eastern Europe true. first started workplace 3 cases cases started declining, shut day sanitation. work place 10-12 confirmed cases factory 400-500 people. shut sanitize. believe they’re enough.. see. clue is. Hope he's okay, exactly news worthy. you...not? went looking Vancouver January 23rd one had.

I old ones SARS.

Too bad almost no-one knows Pasteur fraud whole foundation germ theory bogus pushed forward predator class. Adherence guidelines pretty high, right untill massive wave protests. point people said ""fuck it, going start back square one again,"" went normal lives.


There real psychological effect missing Easter, Memorial Day, summer vacations, 4th July parties, see mass gatherings politicians supporting participating gatherings. That's spoof account, right? Problem best case still live March get vaccine. Maybe longer, seems nothing approved kids. know kids typically get minor symptoms, I'd rather chance it.   especially since probably going last one due holidays...

it's like making party middle rather sparse minefield... yes, lose extremities, one hell party :) positive side 2 3 say no.  Almost makes think 2 3 Americans dumb. Trump would protect us may cost us lives. True hero american peoples even more. clearly understand risk. cost like 2 cents 2 dollars. course be. good answers what's happening government support small businesses - particularly bars restaurants, worst places go take mask off.

I'm saying alive without business better dead, dead family members, hospital COVID. also better overwhelmed healthcare system can't help everyone. lesser two evils. Home Brave, man. mean study ongoing? mean? I'm good 13.

Stubborn ... that’s funny way spell idiotic. response unscientific. gone, troll. 
The truth none people actually give shit workers. Yeah shit asking antimaskers states sign since ""hoax"" all🙄
Triage going happen lot places whether like not. people took seriously get prioritized. control people states believe, I'm sure point making here. helps 75% Australia stayed COVID outbreak free economy could prop Victoria. think anyone wants go WH holiday party anyway.

Poor Mink :( really was. moderately terrified caused go deaf, apparently pus exploding ears particularly abnormal thing toddlers. knew? sucks they're treating way, honesty I'd grateful anything safe point. so, Thanksgiving, travel across country congregate family. - definition - made people different generations. 

This end well. Ten thousands lives could save Thanksgiving would moved Spring. once. year. past vaccine deployment. 

Thanksgiving something people agree upon. mechanism sun something. make every year. change it. change ten thousands lives, change different date? Science! works.. bitches Quick, somebody make gif! LOL Government issue ID kind checking personal information. US, required give ID unless committing crime. Sure, many problems come backing line giving 'proof' vaccination go long way. Literally first thought. ""are yet?"" I’m worried work in...well “worked” music industry. feel like I’m going really hard time crowds this. going eradicate virus people still catch least rarely. one going forget cognizant now. world stumble along like without war blame often. people going understand virus cannot contained it’s flu, common flu never rid matter people suggest. That’s folks modern flu added chesty cough. Don’t fooled trickery control. Equating editorial piece New York Times conspiracy Facebook garbage idiotic hot take I’ve ever read honestly. yet? uhh visited boise Halloween night... uh... people dont care much masks... Yeah that’s Pfizer’s CEO said. Hope JnJ others follow, wouldn’t mind study longer wasn’t global pandemic. Haha. think smart move get needed data 2-3 months, apply EUA, cross placebo patients, way wouldn’t drop out. want collect study data propriety it’s first clinical trial AD26 platform. far COVID safety, I’d rather fly eat inside restaurant. That’s choose two. 

Airplanes better air circulation filtration standard hospital room. Living Mando life rapid one less reliable, no? know several people get tested waited week results, even waiting get test taken. I'm sure rapid one available everywhere perhaps? like dumb? paying people stay home, instead handing trillions businesses. People going work. People exposed work say ""Fuck matter see people love inevitably get I'm exposed work every day."" Also LARGE group people America who've told identity hard worker, shut without giving come suddenly identity feel defensive weak. way combat issue paying people stay home shutting everything down. clearly seeing happens social safety net place. linear graph completed live time linear regression collecting data seeing bigger picture could dip unnoticeable five years data?..but whatever. confirm. Pediatricians want negative COV19 test treating in-office. 

So come Urgent Care, tested prescribed antibiotics *if* evidence simple ear infection. 

Complaints Urgent Care rise pandemic spikes. Primary Care doctors demanding negative test results seeing *all* patients....and Urgent Care centers seeing everyone result. Add recent demand testing, Urgent Care centers swamped. literally said agree guy. Stop defensive learn read. yea that's recommended protocol healthcare workers face shield plus n95. problem masks n95 seal well part air going around edges. sad number one person.... entire family, groups friends, entire lifelong connections

And yet we're *still* seeing people travel! even freaking thanksgiving. know people going eastern European country, flying America, 'because open'. seem understand cases pretty much time (caveat since testing really in-place first surge) *have* travel. can't wait see resurveyed month. Authoritarianism right now. must messy ;) It’s almost like shit works??!!!!  remember good jobs walking top 2x4 walls pulling trusses 30 feet. experience really helps now, extremely stressful. Yes, parent post said stupid. You’re redundant. vote him. city vote him. county vote him. It’s like Mexico too. idea, I'm making policy here! much hate thread people flying...

I live Colorado. get see family year live Georgia. 

Why shouldn’t fly home next month? I’m taking risk seriously plan everything power stay healthy keep parents healthy. 

You guys act like people aren’t autonomous adults make life decisions weighing risks benefits. see downtown Paris called ""lockdown"", would really see tons people streets care less meeting rule... Plus, meetings upto 6 allowed many people abusing that. think really stand back let others vaccine first already infected. Time start scaring people straight. showing gated communities work go there. time. Ah, well, that's better past weekend suppose. Thanks context. Several years?  [Jed Bartlett headdesk instead. Shit, I'm sorry. least able get another job. can't even get one local grocery store. watched whole thing. state got it. made clear msnbc anchors viewers wear masks, masks protect wearer well around them. get then? Problem conservative side agrees response coronavirus. Bad guy? like bad ass. High five! Honestly, risk regardless young am. Lots COVID long-haulers young people 20s 30s. average age, iirc, around 40. exactly old people. know long symptoms last; may even permanent cases. thank you. giving money normal people stay home letting ultra rich loot money would certainly help. likely want news interfere election. hand soap wash away virus. kind mild surfactant break lipid membrane virus. need special anti-microbial detergent 80% alcohol hand soap long washing water slough off. Correct. agree totally agree, big. definitely big cafe culture. know first-hand many people kept illegal parties basement dinners, grand scheme things, really small percentage thousands people going restos, bistros bars every night. American got running Feel-Bad Event Year. mean people stuff general comes handling raw meat, otherwise get cross contamination. Lol. That's exactly think works. I'm guessing things worked way decades ago? may want look vaccine trial actually involves think it’s done laboratory conditions. It’s much “in streets” already. point making unique USA. Stop full yourself. bunch people sick decided get tested could get false sense security travel Thanksgiving

That sound like plausible explanation, thanks! sure Illinois implemented anything beyond ""advisory"" whatever week ago. really good wages college etc well time. know lot retired guys making almost $10/hr retired 20+ years.  make double average wage town. That's offer certain people stay us save house. Eliminating rent, electric bill, etc makes easy save. never chance. Third world countries don’t need vaccine, die 60 diseases, like malnutrition even diarrhea. people 70 least 3 additional pathologies die Corona. Look stats. HazmatBiden.jpg Good response. Made rethink thoughts. Good them! Strange though... seems like whenever hear statistic X % people choosing stupid answer almost always 1/3. Hell, least they're consistent, even consistently wrong Okay, get blood draw every clinic visit go to, 4 go near year.

Bingo. People cry *BU* *MUH RIGHTS* selfish short sighted. trade stops “hard decisions” include shelving Thanksgiving travel plans, according CDC.

People's poor judgement life partners never fails amaze me. wife responded like generosity, wife. Minors already give consent certain medical procedures. example, abortion. 

There zero reason minor give consent abortion flu shot. It’s ridiculous. 

Maybe consider instead dropping medical consent age across board something like 16 allow *all children* *any age* right defer medical professionals disagree parent. It’s happens parents can’t agree anyway system already place.  yay vaccine literally going available next 6 months everyone. hold 6 months “Where districts barely contact tracing all”

If manufactured data, make study confirm set narrative. Idk are, real life ground true. Lives matter here, confirmation bias. live Texas. Wow  Also, rural America today rural America then.  good roads, medical facilities, communications, electricity, sanitation, on. Headline read

She's already said model may work overseas. Also, weight America sorting fucking shit first time history, solely land Biden. Americans need take accountability, exact way did. NZ government solve covid problem, did. \*I agree mandatory COVID vaccinations. avoiding air travel case. think need better protocols protect elderly. I've heard 25 million doses every month. get large percentage people vaccinated, take long. Oxford vax could change timeline though. Hum. Grocery clerks, maybe. HHAs, maybe. Custodians, sure. teachers healthcare professionals, no. right around 14-15% around beginning November.

In states like North Dakota youre seeing downticks reach 25% number matches NYC otehr early hit areas experiencing. intial threshold 20-25% seems entry level Herd Immunity. lot laws make much sense think it:

Who cares Australia gets Chinese travellers per capita? According study, Covid19 spread Europeans, Chinese. Proud state making incredibly long lockdown, feels like pulled back edge cliff honest. close control virus couldn’t contained, today rest states Australia learned mistakes realise going hard start best option lockdown lasts months longer expected. ‘Close country foreigners.’ think responding wrong thread fake quoting build sort pathetic transparent strawman. Careful buddy, I’m American sir, are... (checks numbers) completely correct. nice day. Yes, this. got titer booster last year. Hopefully one created immunity.

Cough, check. spread first couple days, check. Yes CDC panicked first months. 12 days hospital far, tell unlike flu ever had, really intense I'm charge.

But shutting simple process almost every country able figure out. Yup, need many studies order conclude something many variables. 

So far best way get via indoor close proximity. Mask that's spread.

The next best general close proximity/being crowd. nurse, imaging professional, I'm already, feels like beginning. I’d expect standard travel vaccines come    No, called science history. 

AstroZeneca released data vaccine less effective Pfizer's Moderna's. means would take time vaccinate everyone achieve herd immunity.

Dude, even bother responding; know talking anti-scientific nonsense makes eyes hurt. reason child consent vaccine reverse child’s best interest. disproven anything btw, unless saying vaccine already distributed billions. know, *in streets*. try pretend results identical. article even mentions clinical trials, mRNA vaccines caused temporary side effects 80%-90% trial participants, mild: sore arms felt cruddy day two. one fell seriously ill. **Though could change vaccines given billions people, early results suggest bad reactions rare.**

I travelled Australia portugal 5 weeks ago using 2 different airlines 3 different planes making 2 stops , even audacity leave London Heathrow small day tourism around city , guess never contracted Covid, behaviour whole trip even London like Covid exist , used public transport touched every surface possible even wash hands occasions 😅, guess arrived portugal safe sound , contract Covid , far 5 weeks trip got tested 2 times guess covid nothing..

I think get Covid easily plane perhaps I'm immune knows. Wow doc talked him? Im almost 19 reason know put condom is... alternative sources. school said ""Sex bad"".

Seeing live USA situation country directly impacts me...yes, post going pertain mind. premier victoria, led every coronavirus briefing 129+ days, polling better premier country. leadership widely endorsed. Overwhelming Australian particularly Victorian response respect follow advice science backed authorities. really giving get vaccine, huh. found today, live Canada Canadian citizen, STILL fly US, always able fly US since March 2020 borders closed. 

I'm fucking shocked found today many people circumvented rule entered Canada/USA FLYING could driving!

It's obvious, rules place protect people, fact airlines busy now, tells us COVID19 second wave going fuck us over. Pfizer Moderna's vaccine effectiveness? Like hell would inject something that's 70% effective! Based what? Sour grapes? constituents dumb too. least ones vote. CDC Kansas Department Health Environment analyzed trends county-level cases mandate went effect two months afterward. Though rates considerably higher 24 counties required masks, two-month study period brought growth cases control even reduced them. counties require masks continued see cases increase.

As evidenced article, link, KDHE's website. 

Insulting change fact failed read article spouting nonsense. rate declined rose counties mask mandates, unlike counties without them. 8,000+ cases Sunday.....everything big Texas except IQ's never got it. don’t even remember hearing already sexually active stable relationship way engagement. Actually, would 2006. Maybe time came out? Ask Noem, seems think control per Trump's orders. Well really matter passengers coming Australia bet mandate anyone flying Australia must vaccine certificate.so every airline flying Australia need rule. I'm would expect well run countries   wise Historians' gold. would like know also. shut everything extended period time, there’s amount money fix damage come. Many people careers, jobs, businesses actually vested interest keeping. Give people choice good job temporary government checks, they’ll take job every time.

A lot jobs won’t people side, businesses fail across board. “Free money lmao” won’t fix everything, unless you’d also okay paying incentivizing businesses lay people off. Tell dead meat packing workers. what's defense Italy infecting Wuhan? Chaos cultists I've ever seen heresy influence Nurgle  I'm really sorry. 

It's like countries idiots like that, America another level this. quite surprising me, start whole thing sure USA would one country come top this. dumb people get elected first place ? like someone spent alot time effort figuring correct way win lottery, uses effectivly win, offers help others win. That’s totally fine, happy Australian government acting accordingly, however still poor negative public response. point every country facing issue, others. Acting XYZ country better example handle mess little pretentious.  yet find charts state include IHS (Indian Health Service) hospitalization rates. Maybe first receive vaccine. know. Since distributing it? Shut down! Don’t worry economic, health social costs. Forget MILLIONS people die measures. Forget lack evidence lockdowns positive effect. SHUT 2 part vaccine... Nutjobs exist everywhere. Luckily absolute minority majority rejected conspiracy theorists. Well that's good would rather people die. Sociopaths. article states pretty well. That's absolutely crazy doctor makes like 80,000 pounds. That's like upper level manager private company bachelor's I'm definitely willing take it, although likely able July. I'm pregnant, there's enough research available risks could present baby. I'll definitely encouraging folks get vaccine. mother told today going sisters house TG. hang kids- going ""in person"" classes time even spike town. asked smart thing do. didnt answer. asked going MIL's coming home. said ""No. safe""

So mom gets Covid ends dead sister. me. I'll sitting house immediate family turkey, fixings Covid Ah efficiency c*pitalism never heard actually enforced private businesses. Probably live, people wear masks police... school US used give us flu shots go doctor it. pretty sure that's low income area needed proof flu vaccine anyway. Still employed living within means hey, could way worse. Two points:

- ""those test positive asked undergo daily tests seven days."" makes risk minimal. rapid/screening tests (which I'm assuming kind tests they're PCR's pricey take longer process) unlikely get wrong repeatedly.

- alternative many people contagious required stay home forego income unnecessary harm inspiration others get tested all. First lab confirmed case. plenty suspected cases dating back October. long run paying people $1000 get vaccine save way costs. Yup. hoooooooooooooooooooooomins USA want stuff. nearly (except Easter, Easter still gave shit back spring) *have* mass casualty events extent. Hey, thanks taking time share experience.

Must nice, got classified 1% good enough work SC, part even spent year trying work instead immediately trying get disability. asked applied year. said would prefer work sense every job denied injury saying would much lability employ eventually got hint applied disability. 

 trying get lawyer got denied lawyer would take seen DR 2 years wanted see DR therapy come back see 6 months. 

So injured enough one wants take risk, injured enough get disability.  

I drive uber injury enough pay bills, enough get cycle. glad money earning retirement, super long term screwed, next 20-25 years going pain literally figuratively doctor denied opportunity practice politics, cant treat anyway. denied died covid due republican policies dumpster fire White House. Mask mandate continues, gathering mandate changed ""recommendations"". Looks like right  people keep confusing guilt regret. It’s whole experience one massive transmission vector. So, wrong exactly? Avoid crowds, except mass rioting? Fauci put report?

Enjoy lockdown About? already happening. big concern thinking people simply going lie. 

If go restaurant vaccine widely available think it’s safe assume people won’t it. blend crowd won’t know has, taken vaccine.

That’s thankful it’s 95% effective. trying say? start wearing masks, guys. get jab contagious. VERY. No, would blood hands. would closed businesses. Jesus. Imagine seeing US government response COVID fucking assholes getting vaccine first? 

Fuck everything US.  Yeah shit worth end says soon possible. many tens millions skeptical get people get it? showing wants first get vaccine get it. That’s invalid survey conversation.   issue

What kind side effects people experienced? didn’t vote man, assumed he’d least Florida residents’ best interests heart. mistaken. I’ll never forgive death toll. losses friends family sustained.  remember right, China actually capability self-sufficient, import goods variety. anyone ever feel like we’re pleading void? family history psoriatic arthritis too... wonder plays it. Hope feel better soon! Hello no. never considered perspective. totally mark, though. going die who? people like seem problem government spend taxpayer's money on, know, taxpayers. People making fun me, know they're making dumb choices, like straight lifeblood me. invigorating know intentionally ignorant people dislike direction headed. true people, many people, yes, true. Military apparently. ""Rules thee, me"" motto, all... article definitely worth reading full commenting China actually hide outbreaks, hence fact reported state media. thing measles, mumps, tick-borne diseases, I’d say 99 percent time covid, people receptive. wanted stop outbreak, it’s politicized. Every time get phone, you’re hoping don’t get cussed at. Probably half people call skeptical combative. refuse talk. deny positive test results. hang up. say they’re going hire lawyer. give fake people they’ve spent time fake numbers. lie tell they’re quarantining alone home, background hear beeping scanner Walmart.

Behaviors like big part we're managing pandemic poorly. large number people simply see part society anymore. : (  Oh protests wrong? flu contagious kills quite fair amount people per year despise fact we've got vaccines protect elderly.

Now, coronavirus obviously much bigger deal, thankfully deadly thought (as opposed stats hand back March). idiots prolonging virus. think important shame people like these.

You're totally right, 8 straight months warnings exactly did. /s Indeed, disability claims typically initially denied every state, Texas. neighbor got 30 years worth payments doctor resubmit paper work disability originally claimed denied. 

Covid caused lot new situations dealt before, precedent deal them. Unfortunately, take time, government funding programs, probably law suits resolve them. 

For example case - get sick working job, due exposure work personal time, family member? None side cases would normally claimable work comp. would tell? front line personnel assumed exposed part work due higher risk exposure? so, percentage? defined ""front line'? Doctors? Nurses? hospitals? include private clinics? hospitals, cleaning staff get included? front desk personnel? Orderly's? Admin staff? Police? Firemen, EMS paramedics? list goes on. Congress likely make something happen help situation. Texas blue red? That’s pretty fucked talking coworkers stories people would hearsay within hearsay. Hearsay squared. That's rely it.

Both articles link talk Canadians leaving Canada medical care. anecdotal cases coming US, there's evidence going US widespread. Even Daily Signal article citing Fraser Institute, 2 sources far unbiased, found 63,000 Canadians leaving. That's little 1 1000 Canadians, there's data many go US (but obviously them).

Studies shown [this article points out: earth would pay it? Obviously leave ""basic needs"" point out. Complex procedures US easily run $100,000. minuscule fraction Canadians could afford go US healthcare.

The thing [happens 320,000 Americans going abroad care. (I'm sure covid fucked gonna do?) Meanwhile US spends 18% GDP healthcare Canada around 11%. Canada spends around $5,000 per person--less half US does.

Why say VA doctors less qualified? heard part problem. Golly gosh gee whiz hope turn badly hope come contact safe subject f\*cking idiots' whims. think millions new cases daily Christmas. ground zero cleaning/searching bodies exposed chemicals/fumes/smoke/and knows else. started get sick/cancers. Congress denied funding healthcare. Families ruins brave ones running everyone running out. John steward stood congress, highly recommend searching speech/asswhipping congress. never even remotely close official government line. Where'd get impression? Wtf Yeah, graduated 2009. understand. took years get stable enough feel like real adult. one year, got taken away anyways. Never hope. get better. got tricked hope Obama admin. ever end trap. semester hell. gotten progressively worse gone on, weekends time homework, time something that's coursework extracurricular related feel guilty it. things used ligthen mood destress worth-it anymore energy. feel delusional nervous craziness going everyone/everything acting though totally normal. 

I can't even begin explain much stressed mess semester. Life gotten crazy feel like barely keeping head water past eight months. 

Stay strong, folks. power this. There's Chinese place near called ""Your Kitchen"" I've ordered previously DoorDash.

Now DoorDash sending emails saying ""Hungry? Try Kitchen Again""

Why yes, try kitchen next time I'm hungry. Thanks idea. I'm guessing article proves people negative IQ.  They've time. turn now. edgy dont remember wrong, one recent new cases China this, closed whole city tested millions (Imagine millions dollars something like this). point worthy stop imports.

They also vaccinating people now, essential people port workers, frozen foods problems continue happen countries, China cannot stop food imports whole globe, still need import lot food. want safely missonary Like 95% people commenting read headline lmao feel like I’m screaming void point go. state it’s work comp program. states employer friendly others employee friendly. states employee friendly; insurers, TPAs employers penalized heavily bad faith claims handling. penalties collected state penalties paid directly injured worker. much anti vax, vaccine rushhed know basics like safety, long prevents infection etc. Sure thing... around 59% (as today) point never said ""vast majority"" hovering around 50% months depending poll sources 40s 70s. USA large diverse
 population even accept covid problem, id say anything 50 point miracle. Source number: like source, whole bunch number. put numbers pop 331M aprox. would around 195M care (or think hoax admittedly get survey). short, story rest America. areas got bad masking up, likely take vaccine. areas whole thing ""made up"" we're dying Biden win wont willing get vaccine. People continue believe it’s problem impacts they’re sick, like entire pandemic. Live USA.

Have family France.

Already lost someone know covid.

It upsets still people take seriously. Especially drastic increase cases week alone ability lead even deaths, especially strain medical staff endure year. 

Everyone safe please. really impact lives people know, strangers ones know too. 

Wear mask. Social Distance. travel across country Thanksgiving. Shelter down, help out, lets slow spread. Go 2 million! IT! still remember horror NYC April, also remember ""We together mentality, people cheering health care workers would leave shifts. Seems like lost since then. I'm sorry. 2 weeks later gonna see record numbers ""We regret getting together X occasion."" article posts, right?  lesser two evils situation. dont think youre completely wrong take one trip hospital right clear EVERYONE lesser evil is. shut things properly time. yep like flu then, lots deaths, least hospital system get overwhelmed. 

Though social distancing still needed Well, gay. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ Well going backfire Trump members clan start running independent splits GOP. Yep. certainly care healthcare workers.

I hope stage mass walkout. deserve it. American govt 2020 completely abandoned people. incredible. like moment show character something wrong never thought capable of.

Congress give wooden nickel help stay home cover medical costs even though right they've gone home pay great health insurance. Yup. celebrating start covid panic figured proved right.

It's like virus can't decide wants know they're supposedly waiting for. Another 3-6 months arbitrary number. There's already nearly long evidence suggest safe. 3-6 months new administration vaccine still going 3-6 months show anything. we'll see much larger pool vaccinated people, meaning there'll negative reactions (like vaccine) people use justify wanting take it. Hell, saw thing HPV vaccine must recently. Hundreds thousands safe administration peele would point save 1 2 random reactions reason avoid it. problem, however, HPV. People dying exponentially something needs done sooner later. live Kansas City, MO exactly happening here. city wide mask mandate since start pandemic followed well. small rural areas wearing masks whatsoever shipped metro area due limited hospitals / icu beds therefore metro area wearing masks getting turned away ICU space due rural non-maskers sent here. Man thats awesome. Crazy think places essentially controlled virus successfully USA we're staring barrel shotgun loaded darkest winter we've lifetime. 

Freedom that, time go visit family.   ""Working spending money fine, everything else risky."" I'm shocked false narrative. I’m spamming try help people don’t know they’re talking about, like you. 

Yes point isn’t proven, here’s something else consider.

The Pfizer/moderna trials tested participants symptoms, whereas Oxford trial tested participants weekly, symptoms not. Seeing least 20% covid cases asymptomatic (some studies said 80%, say around 40%) Pfizer/moderna efficacy results really questionable frankly quite unreliable. Oxford study much accurate. 

Also expect explain half vs full dose effective lol? It’s triggers immune response don’t claim understand mechanism behind that. neither. seemed talking different things. Get sun Scotland lol.. either ...and rest wear masks forever badge says ""Ignorant - stand back"". see ur logic mostly agree. definitely wont jumping get shot time know whatever concoction theyve spun wont cause cancer issues 5-10 years line? find flight doesnt rule say makes sense reason tracability this, would HUGE catastrophe lied something like this, would literally destroy trust vaccines &amp; public health decades come. enough damage done already Oh, sweet summer child. live rural area 40% people see wear masks public. friend hospital says send dozen people nearest city (2 hr drive) every week. Shit Department Give liberty give death! Studies indicate 40% currently unwilling take vaccine...sigh... Dissonant policies also run risk fueling mistrust resentment public already beset fatigue pandemic politics, Dr. Tuite ""If you’re average person looking what’s allowed what’s allowed, may make lot sense,"" said. ""I get together nine best friends sit around table restaurant. can’t house?""

This article makes excellent points. course there's risk people house. point article politically-driven policies maintaining indoor restaurant dining forcing 40 people work together open office allowing 500 people gather church service would cause way harm six people dinner party house.

And people see dissonant policies assume policies equally ridiculous listen them. That's saying. They're saying simply matter safe is, solidarity cannot quarantine. nice idea sentiment theory, know practice even reasonable logical people want gather truly believe safely. Well yeah..a lot rural hospitals ventilators well staffed ICU ... might 1 2 beds 30 makes sense going cause massive problem millions people ignoring CDC recommendation travel Thanksgiving going make problem million times worse  haven’t made argument right party trumps everyone else’s freedom make living , grocery shop travel without douchebags actively trying harm them.
Meanwhile anti-maskers Reddit telling others freedom go outside non-existent “stay inside”

Suddenly freedom movement gone “right party”: Everyone live life freedom everyone wears mask socially distances.

The likely cause delivery vector virus itself, first dose immunity vector, makes booster shots bit tricky thing.

If someone would kind forward site searches user history, I'll dig posts long time ago said much, prove post-hoc analysis. So... yea... want people avoid family, even though safe possibly be.... people might able that?

You guys think good mentality? That's lunacy...  Good you. wish happiness! agree disagree. J&amp;J already made deals manufacturing plants US start production vaccine. months ago

I agree. current front-runners 
  bet people (if given choice) would choose one dose vaccine multi dose one.
 
I agree well, fact, J&amp;J's shows much efficacy Moderna, Pfizer Oxford's, would probably gold standard going forth. However, point information now, vaccines coming two shots J&amp;J's stage Moderna Pfizer maybe another couple months person truly awful scary. many students come school symptoms exposed Covid lie quarantine. 

I also can't teach usual way want stay far away kids possible, classroom management suffers bit skip lot fun lessons they'd involve much potential covid risk. make sense contributing factor could since spring, AA meetings online, church basement stumble get help. provide evidence vaccines RCTs results were? Otherwise you’re blowing smoke.

Commenting I’m super curious see intelligent amazing response mindblowing revelation Checking Canadian hospital staff, casual coverage staff make take unpaid sick leave since casual staff sick/vacation time. 

It's sadly we're seeing, hazard pay wishful thinking... wish they'd support us we're sick. wish Operation Warp Speed, here! Acknowledging people exist communism. Tired wearing masks maybe? I'm teacher hybrid school right now, unfortunately let work home (even though cases spiking right risks high baby). :( Won’t antibodies vaccine though ?  good analogy that! I'm going use one. Thanks! Wrong

Wrong scary... swear criminal abuse medical credentials anti-science. (Dr) front name convenient trying spread propaganda worry, discovery vaccine given immunity shortlived due new Season Spring Qantas doesn’t care. want borders Australia open. customers live rich countries and/or afford pay vaccine. alternative Australia closing borders longer, enforce vaccination board even state didn’t, don’t want risk leaky border closed they’ve resumed operations. wear mask large number medicines discovered repurposed accident, penicillin Viagra anti-vaxxers realize unvaccinated life like, many change minds.

I'm guessing kids need vaccination go school. Many jobs require vaccination. Flights, events, theaters, restaurants. would go deciding gets hospital bed 1, 5 people critical condition needed it? almost breaking point. Taking necessary precautions, wearing mask, keeping distant refraining parties zero negative consequences. everyone that, wouldn’t shut downs, therefore impact economy, whatever worry about. It’s really hard. many people dim refuse that, problem. deaths currently happening, hospitals packed capacity.. that’s negative impact. 

And nowhere say “vast majority”. like alter words (I actually don’t like case unsure. fact shows credibility). it’s 30% lasting effects, assuming 60% population gets covid, that’s 1.36 billion people. Even it’s 10%, almost half billion people lasting effects. That’s lot people health problems, strain health system far. Exactly. add virus spread aerosols September 18th...several months pandemic.

Edit: letter Hospitals average run 75-80% full almost time, takes one catastrophic event run 100%. vaccine granted emergency approval, pressure developers offer immunization trial participants received placebo. many people cross vaccine group, companies might enough data establish long-term outcomes, safety, long vaccine protection lasts whether jab prevents infection disease.

I get it. inconvenient put risk. Pretending magically compelled helpful though. remove giant stick ass? problem?? Take step back try look outside perspective first comment may come across. 1 truth 1000 lies Wtf thank for? Old news Read article. Two dose sizes tested. Giving small first dose full sized second dose later 90% efficacy. know truth statement, know sentiment behind too.

But, like, whole ""get nation addicted painkillers drug company representatives wine dine doctors"" saga like, years ago. pretend every doctor every nurse Asmiov's Three Laws coded conscience? Hey, hospital photo neighborhood. That’s reassuring. long awaited sequel One obvious measure take double triple number medical school students year. Sure won’t help pandemic. plenty coming. Missing point completely. OP's example individual rural hospitals fewer ICU beds (ie) accommodate lower patient population corresponding hospitals city. population support ICU beds single hospital.......... would open hospitals?

Also, users struggle maintain empathy someone even voted individual region voted, sounds like problem y'all's hearts rural people. depressing? never flag waving RAH RAH patriot, traveled lived abroad, least appreciated opportunities American woman afforded care country. devastatingly sad watch fall apart see breathtakingly selfish huge number Americans are. article broke heart read summer things gotten worse since then.  Keyword: Trump hate people I'd say evidence support suppositions. Look measles outbreaks occured. uneducated impoverished communities.

You're also forgetting poorly educated economically depressed residents cities, that's theory putting forth. Cause yeahhh, people willfully ignorant point. I'm seeing upvoted comment gloating. Indifference? Sure. Anger? Sure. Sadness? Sure. feel emotions knowing people overwhelmingly supported getting situation. Personally, though, I'm mostly pissed people. villainize city people intellectualism every turn. lot people asked situation - deal it.  12% trust vaccines general 10% would like study efficacy taking themselves.

While appreciate sentiment behind this, many 10% knowledge patience necessary read (and correctly interpret) stacks stacks raw trial data? know don't.

Because gonna that, left trusting word scientists medical professionals say ""we're confident vaccine safe"". already right now. Dang, that's crazy. hand that's great there's much demand vaccines.

I went Safeway 10% coupon (x3 family), got feeling many people went yet it.....certainly peak hours. authority shut borders. 

He literally can't NZ did. happens someone like Iran notices goes “hmm, us army basically medics, seems like good time go cluster bomb phosphorus max injury”  mean Applebee’s always gives 1 500 chance getting food poisoning there’s Probably not. it’s already going take several months widely available young healthy people. we’ll see lot data first couple groups given priority feel comfortable taking it’s widely available always use tape/vaseline seal ill-fitting mask would superior cloth mask. long give others higher age group asymptomatic carrier (though guess could give another 20 yr old gives old person) yeah, hear you. 

I'm saving like 1-2k travel tho. Ain't mad that. testing plan public record. look fda department, students also option taking incomplete, provided professor agrees signs it. means student assigned grade ""I"" change normal letter grade completion whatever assignments left (up professor), time limit year. Presumably folks small towns private insurance? I'm going copy post couple pages up.

 *You’re graciously assuming many rural folks insurance begin with. ones previously demanded individual mandate requiring insurance removed ACA.*

Not them, course, expect rural people higher % insured urban. quite possibly less. would suggest 62% protection per study, bad - pointed participants vaccine cohort developed severe case hospitalised, whether half full dose. understanding mRNA factor like different port body. 

It’s simply entering engaging different genetic code vaccines order produce antibody response. like general process pretty much every vaccine process. again, correct I’m misinformed. 

And it’s also impossible determine common medicine won’t cause long term damage. It’s gamble public taking essentially since beginning modern medicine. look like vaccine development outside US similar time frame dont think rushed You’re spot Seems vast underestimate thread amount people refuse take vaccine short-term due worries safe well tested could be. 

There monster PR exercise front alone - even crazies won’t believe science. That's right. matter fact, healthcare worker. told expect inoculations. best guess end December. That's still month away.  Nah.
 
Would care discussion substance previous comment? detract productive conversation? people giving freedom see it. collectivist ideology paving way Communism. Future communist governments use technology control population abuse power. That's societies work.

They start slow masks, lockdowns, mandatory vaccines airlines, drivers licenses, etc, etc.

Does anyone see going? Mandatory vaccinations abused governments see electronic communications phone activity. Look modern history. Didn’t control enough NYC, obviously. It’s back strong before.

Australia New Zealand require people quarantine 2 weeks enter country. Americans see evil tyranny. two countries also isolated developed countries world. infinitely easier keep track coming in.

Vietnam shares border China, also required 2 week quarantine travelers. Here’s excerpt BBC article:

“Enforcing social distancing quarantine relied entrenched system ""loyal neighbourhood party cadres spying area residents reporting superiors"", says Phil Robertson Human Rights Watch,

There undoubtedly ""rights-violating excesses"" process, told BBC.

""But many people hear episodes government's total control media,"" adds, citing cases people fined prosecuted criticising government response.”

Unless you’re island nation way ocean, can’t stop virus without “violating rights”

We need national lockdown US, mask mandate fines violators, everyone tests positive needs forced participate contact tracing threat fine. Americans fucking babies need hand held this. quarter million dead get worse someone power actually cracks down, supreme court would never allow that. guaranteed lose least half million lives matter do... American system government completely powerless pandemics. happen years learned nothing Yes start analyzing “specifics” someone asymptomatic happens to, say, go grocery store, even without mask, very, little chance actually spreading virus, couple 99%+ survival rate asymptomatic people present incredibly small risk actually harm others. responsibility decide close contact with. mean Republicans?

Hang there, shall pass I'm sure base goal, last year's sales, sure much. manager announced left night guessed why, probably right. Unfortunately people think stupid makes cool.

The problem whenever high risk event make sure beforehand risk covid small possible make sure get high risk event dont spread afterwards.  
People treat like diet ignore completely every second day like one cheat day planned accounted for. Hopefully everyone knows now, use TP substitutes like wipes paper towels, flush them. Paper towels specifically designed break apart wet, means stay together long enough plug toilets clog septic systems. separate garbage next toilet good idea here.

So far good. Good work Cambodia 🇰🇭 sooner corporate greed comes end better. Capitalism existed less 1 percent time human species we're facing existential threat it.

Of course, corporate class would sooner country descend civil war status failed state would give ounce wealth power.

Hope works you! posted reposted days. instances goverment fails people pandemic. tragic example yet another. we’ve collectively forgotten internet shopping?  I’m saying precautions bad universities first line scolded contributing spread

Its universities. entire govt's push make universities self sustaining. researcher, think idea much money takes build facilities labs employ people actually make difference. reducing funding education universities, making universities operate budget get getting lot state international students. pandemic, universities forced either lose quality researchers forced continue classes collect fees. govt also blame. Investing research thing govt much used to. 

Having said that, ASU Michael Crow suck. little more. dad 68 delivers babies hospital owns gynecology clinic. can't C-section home.

Are families hospital/retail workers also prioritized, them? work home, live brother girlfriend work retail. extended family decided going Disney World important thanksgiving Christmas us year, gall say sad couldn’t join us “because Revo wants us quarantine 2 weeks.” Right park opened bigger 35% capacity, too. It’s absolutely heartbreaking frustrating see people take seriously. mean, idgaf them. care innocent people people may spread to, healthcare beds could taken them, prolonging pandemic selfish idiots like experiences diminished exceptional rule apparently NEEDS outlined. Really? Embrace suck, march Zoom. spring situation regions (NYC example) short time. 

Now countrywide expected virus peak season last mid-March. different situation. RBD-specific antibodies detected 111 959 (11.6%) individuals, starting September 2019 (14%), cluster positive cases second week February 2020 highest number (53.2%) Lombardy. study shows unexpected early circulation SARS-CoV-2 among asymptomatic individuals Italy several months first patient identified, clarifies onset spread coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.

Having virus present Italy September 2019 quite bold claim. anyone provide insight this? I'm supporting claims all. fact I'm somewhat skeptical, interesting nonetheless. Huh? defending people getting care basis republican, wtf about. saying nobody denied treatment arguing lol.

My life impacted covid early March.. hilarious. actually think know things. one internet, go back r/politics. People still don’t comprehend exponential growth. I'm thankful 95% extended family side science 5% knows damn lonely make fuss anti-science views.

My mom's birthday July 24th also celebrated *exactly* would've without pandemic. don’t get it!! PEOPLE SHOPPING CROWDS FUCKING PANDEMIC?!? No! dare find positive meaning it. obviously means masks social distancing 2025 earliest. New normal! Well president downplaying whole situation months. second Trump said CDC recommendation wear mask suggestion wouldnt wear one basically heading path going now. though. using experiences abused insult ridicule someone else spread misinformation. would damaging address issues. Yup exactly, plaintiff's need tack-on whole ""pain suffering"" endure painful litigation others get claims without jump hoops. Texas knows probably first many claims making hard get paid. Oh Brazillian Government, huge surprise. 

/s don’t know name, there’s reason would know anything relatives friends. don’t burden people personal problems, whether it’s person internet. I’m sorry loss, I’m going judge people internet decent time family friends, making rational, grown decisions so.

Weird explained detail 2020, yet are. don't. busy whole time, even since black Friday sales started weekend. seriously ignorant think compares 1930s Germany. CDC recommends, ""If employee confirmed COVID-19, employers inform fellow employees possible exposure COVID-19 workplace maintain confidentiality required Americans Disabilities Act (ADA).""

But that's recommendations. think there's legal requirement. recommendations inform employees exposure see. Telling coworker, even would obvious anyway, probably thing illegal Yerp. Selfish buzzword here. Selfish entitled. look family members act like fcking idiots, yet shake head what’s going on, they’re selfish people know. 

One family members got promoted large gathering buffet style food bowling alley. saw friend her’s posted picture. almost DIED covid. I’m thirty. She’s selfish person, though. I’ve actually found lot peace zooming acting dumb realizing that, DUH, person WOULD act like that! pay attention negative people...hope everything works you~ used food stamps college. FANTASTIC! eating top ramen thought apply. would like hope food security gave opportunity accomplish academic goals become better member society. Hey ok, I'm Texas governor insists mask order cannot enforced law enforcement officers going something. Oh, he's sitting nearly 16 billion dollars worth aid could easily going towards unemployment small businesses, least temporary stop gap measure (6 billion CARES act money 10 billion rainy day fund specifically meant emergencies like this). top extra money fiscal responsibility state (which credit for). 

But instead he's going keep state open fully, allow indoor dining, etc. despite fact entire western half Texas start ration care, we'll fucking CNN Dallas we'll stacking bodies outside Parkland hospital right Christmas hits (our modeling says we'll hit 3500 cases day Dec 1, literally next week) think last minute panic buying lockdowns come effect? last minute thanksgiving buying? grateful live state. Yes. Still different purposefully infecting people. someone took tests confirm infected assaulted others coughing spiting them, would example purposeful intent get others sick. important EVERYONE REMEMBER:

The mask you, others. 

Some person building probably sick, improperly containing illness. We'll get lockdowns become default public policy ""contain"" anything government like.

I predict Balkanization America within 2 decades. Maybe one. denied rewnewing immediately. dragged feet.

Imagine first responders thing. clear, I’m referring social security claims, Workers Comp anything else. 
 
And point said “who cares” implied anything like that? Article says eithere confirmes virus came bats, might diverse something found bats. Inconclusive, view. enjoy shitty freeze-dried food unless one else food all?  Better nothing still make dent final death tally. Lol yeah... first thought where’s union, remembered it’s states, considered evil something. Dude. Look way. mom got ppl like stories. People like mom take precautions got people stupid thing again. stories. cousins got brother go attend it. victim. That's made people mad. could've mom except probably old grandparents can’t agree. 

Our mission quarantine people contagious, merely exposed. 

The risk contagious person testing negative small, smaller every day 7 days testing, smaller risk people breaking quarantine given far larger numbers people quarantined exposure leads ro grounding model.

I agree it’s crazy compensate people good citizens losing money safeguard community, aren’t U.S. need limit number people ask make sacrifice unnecessarily. Regular testing that. Ignore him, quick glance profile he's COVID denier, outside sports subs comments r/coronavirus /r/politics disagree, deny facts, show annoyance, likely also Trumper. 

He numerous comments denying proven COVID death count, chance he'd listen reason uncounted ones.  That’s really vaccines work tho...

Also, skeptical doesn’t help ensure safety. don’t know anything say “We sure safe??”. actual experts handling challenging it... feel you. 

Did stint Navy, got worked job almost twenty years, suddenly unexpectedly let go due ""downsizing"" '09.

Had jump several hoops get assistance system paying decades. heck banned last comment?! respectful response!! honestly full shit, dont derail random stuff, im talking death rates.

Why dont look forming consistent arguments going weird rants. 

still waiting source right travel lol I'll take chances. could long term effects vaccine, makes dick fall three years? I'll take chances too. Fuck it, let's roll dice, locked long I'm ready party experience Colorado similar. didn’t mention amount paperwork need bring filling seeming forms filled online. till Musk gets done nuking polar caps (or say).

Not expert terraforming... People give shit unless theirs. then, real them. Tribalistic bullshit. Ohio Uber Driver Total Landscaping plainly false, HIV curable proper medication live full life. 12% positive rate, record test levels means highest levels undetected cases community. hope right, fear not. 2-3 months 30% country infected around 10% vaccinated, thus quite close full herd immunity. pandemic nearly then. GOP sign stimulus - Pelosi made clear wants liability protections. GOP want them. Oh well, difficult completely remove variable world wide pandemic.. let's skip part. Probably important. Haha Thank much kindness good will! really appreciate it! Bless you! EVER HEARD STRAW????

We've also canceled. hugely disappointing, I'd rather accidentally kill parents. celebrations future. schools don’t allow students stay dorms I’ve explained Welcome America! Insurance companies friend. State agencies aren’t either. fact, friends poor people one extremely old white presidential semi-finalist. realize lost colleges don’t allow students stay dorms? one permitted dorms break school. paywalled tho would difficult without daily testing participants.

You could hope antibodies tell something check less frequently, maybe, think finding asymptomatic spread definitely secondary concern trials. Hope drugs Ben Carson got. Dude... death sentence. big deal, I'm sacrificing business, mental health, well-being depend virus poses essentially zero risk me. see CDC, survival rate anyone 70 incredibly high. told survival rate 99.99% beginning this, would never locked down. 99% have. 

You people live world obsessed fear. love afraid, ridiculous

Edit: right travel?

As fundamental right inherent American citizenship nature federal union, the right travel in United States basic American liberty. The right precedes creation United States appears Articles Confederation.

That means whenever want. 5am 10pm. wanna midnight, right so. I'm free human feel like go fuck yourselves. feel like close fucking year dealing bloody well knew better, irresponsible, selfish dipshits. Going funny people getting Covid people insist doesn’t exist... I'm little lost sarcasm not.... rambling about? Dont fucking attend... I’m assuming haven’t spoken extensively EVERY person going thoughts covid. there’s single person going don’t completely trust, wouldn’t go  Let's pray first responders say thanks. Clap heros airports. time take care them, nah that's entitlement program. Smh time bring up. many times going see stories like this? We're 9 months in. learned now, won't. longer feel people story, angers bc infect made right choice gather. ones end suffering. exactly continues spread. ""Not me."" Except yes, you, friends, family. airborne virus, doesnt gaf are. You’re assuming everyone gets vaccine hasn’t covid yet I’m reading right? flexed pcu 5 patients usually 3-4. charges swat nurses take patients. Sooo many codes rapids everywhereEven non covid units much acuity covid patients less nurses. Also patients like almost icu basically. weekend literally drowning. anyways hope something happens it’s gonna get worse obviously. patients flying states too.  mean 6 weeks community transmission (because again, takes effect 3 weeks) enough prove virus gone certain area (all active cases quarantined, entirely plausible active cases time takes effect), rules relaxed further, like mask mandate lifted/only required certain places. I'm happy moved away. Fuck Texas. lived 27 years always kind bullshit. workmans comp myself...fuck insurance companies much!! Even cruises [free even lose it. Furlough days covered Fuck entitled plate rat Like, realistic &amp; optimistic! moment? already there? Sure come back, quarantine. one country already. silly point. Texan them. happens firefighters time Texas. It’s horrible. El Paso twelve morgue trucks. That’s twelve semis hold bodies outside regular morgue. prisoners paid 2 dollars body move dead trucks people like guy still wanna talk survival rates. sick tired explaining co workers Family friends government needed close things people dumb careless.

If people would reduce private contacts like supposed people would basic things like standing 6 feet apart talking someone hugging ran public maybe wouldnt need second lockdown.

But people dumb careless selfish nearly everywhere world, purely relying people right thing going work. Never. x1000, state fucked. hope images recent football game able shame antivax politicians form mandates. within realm possibility reach million casualties. 
The complete total failure government?
The complete lack basic human empathy vast majority people ? 
Or fact even concept really big deal, considering fact possibility absolute worst loss life American history ? 
I cant even care anymore, tired. think corporate class bad now, wait till start hemoraging money new tax plan goes effect. firing people left right probably increase prices products effort make back losses. Enjoy corporate America lasts, cause become hell earth. Bruh voted joe biden opposite inspiring read much work, think would quote sensation intellectually enjoying hours grotesque tentacle hentai flicks without experiencing form sexual arousal. Hope^tm. Lol Hey genuine question. trials vaccine going 6 months time distributed. think additional 6 months bigger population size reveal? feel like itll echo current results show, no? still waiting Trump’s healthcare plan... can't scorn churches neighborhood organizations [...] surprised sacrifice least keep neighbors safe.

How would explain number churches news insisting holding in-person worship services even though known conditions spreading disease? small towns everybody knows they're willing even wear masks? General strike.  Thank reconsidering person made false claim ""But coronavirus rates still higher counties adopted mandate"", clearly going outside parameters study. Thus response proving wrong improper. 

It also take CDC study realize masked mandates cases per capita entire time August, total 26% cases per capita, August now, non-masked counties massive boom cases surpass masked counties 26%. part churchgoer refused wear mask got me. someone religion preaches importance caring neighbor good human callous refuse wear bloody mask? It’s flabbergasting. Take shot every time someone website cries capitalism. Easiest drinking game ever. Flatten curve lol’d always mild symptoms. keel over. &amp;#x200B;

The reason want wear mask save you. care someone else's grandma.

I either. care you. 

The difference willing admit that.  still mention live entertainment.... Somehow everyone forgotten live shows banned since early March. anything. massive conservative media arm spin everything favor times everything. Hypocrisy damned.  it’s done, sure that’ll though likely insurance bill slightly lower notice parents plan anyway. reddit, all. mean, I'm gonna go birthday family birthday family nothing's really gonna change

And family mean like 5 us Don’t believe everything media tells you. Characterizing protesting “Rioting lawlessness” nice way prevent shame people exercising first amendment rights. makes risk minimal

Given increasing awareness role superspreaders / single events propagating virus, think fair alternative many people contagious required stay home forego income unnecessary harm inspiration others get tested 

A better alternative would government provide necessary support allow people isolate. would address risks. severe case? person scared go work, go

So work business didnt shut down, arguing sake currently provision welfare choose quit based health concerns, think would good idea introduce one congress. 

no shit, stay fuck home stop getting everyone sick stupid right move freely states, right travel freely please.

You get car travel ever want. idk talking about. Id like source ""right"". lol I’d class pc gaming device that’s primarily use for, everyone else answered question Share results/paper/project us. I’d like see it. can't find got 2 ICU bed number. Sparrow Ionia Hospital lists total 0 ICU beds occupied COVID patients 40% capacity overall. I'm alarmed hospitals keeping up, least saying night I've noticed exact opposite. NONE hardcore conspiracy theorists Facebook think fake... overblown. Seems like people's reluctance take vaccine that's issue... point see anyone could legit deny SOMETHING happening.  It’s Trump used it, it’s obviously found successful various situations various people Right time considering delays. watching Arkansas weeks ago move pretty quickly google trends. want stay weeks ahead, check google trends put terms: Covid test, Covid testing, Covid symptoms.

Track top areas (states, cities states) past 7 days. weeks, you’ll start see trends emerge areas moving list know become new hot spots weeks ahead. Agree.

these really matter. 

All matters Covid. mention open borders thanks Schengen. Yeah impressive work Deutsche. hard rain gonna fall. not. job hunting alongside people class also internships year. Every company knows this. one surprised see lack internships resume 2020. going okay. assuming people actually take vaccine. again....people carrying lives enjoying themselves.

Also issue bar open? legally open people nothing wrong.  understand difference live attenuated vaccine vs mrna vaccine containing spike protein coronavirus, idk tell you.

Live vaccines always risk giving virus. Chickenpox vaccine another. brother got chickenpox vaccine. common, happens. know doctor nurse ICU’s. would quit indifference nightmare fighting everyday.  catch bar spread grandma two weeks later.... makes feel better, remember taking online courses student. great student fine online courses, also felt like don’t learn much. Even work put time needed it, reason it’s in-person learning. tried save online courses less important topics things pass pass (but didn’t see actually needing using future), it’s unfortunate isn’t option now! talking people trial may since become pregnant, number cases. 30,000 people, might happened. mega church, people disposable subscribers whatever happens God's anyway. disagree. Society needs get spread low possible rapid possible. longer uncontrolled spread, likely new mutuations. 


If get total case load small (ie: hundred thousand active worldwide), there's relatively low risk dangerous mutations.

 
If millions active cases going on, there's going constant risk dangerous mutations, risk government mandated restrictions, even mutation evades vaccine.

Anti-vaxxers clear risk everyone COVID. Don’t even go back fair, government pretty much singlehandedly held economy last Recession TARP bailouts “quantitative easing.” difference common people need direct help, banks auto company executives [Here's tweet, includes free Tell Thanksgiving next year. want Thanksgiving without people loves next year due Covid. live small beach town east coast Florida. masks needed social distancing.

Children. enough people see given thing problematic enough, it'll naturally join sort list. says means months vaccinations drive community spread 

Not indefinitely Yeah that’s I’m saying Still seeing people simply giving shit since gotten colder. Apparently wearing mask rendered good preventative measure, nobody cares go lives - wearing face mask like going outta style (which soon, ironically). Ah, marriage, woman thinks, ""Aisle, altar, hymn."" Well, I'm woefully behind cleanings suspect least one cavity lower right side. I'm still debating. single confirmed case food preparation entire thing? Fauci basically saying slightly conservative version guy saying. comes 300,000 cases day I’m sure empathy much rational safe. See since US vaccine expert really cant find way believe I’ve got chicken freezer parents raised, I’m going cover herbs bacon roast stuffing. 30 people come country Ok, doesnt change ignorance original post. Well math technically 5% (8/170) cases came vaccine group 95% effective. 2/170 it'd 99% effective. right tho, situation Italy way worse government plan vaccine either, US does. 


We fucked happy it. Quick - go take 40,000$ loans full college experience! Stupid stupid does. They’ll eventually get it. personally would a-OK clubs, bars, etc. serve allow anyone gotten vaccine proof anti-bodies. they’re shunned society they’ll cave get it. I’ve students like honestly advice consider taking semester year off. Don’t wreck GPA something beyond control, don’t make hate school much things return “normal” you’re still resentful system. Especially it’s impacting mental health, ability learn, ability enjoy college—take time away. We’ll come back. lower enrollment right now, colleges welcoming back open arms you’re ready!

Edit: I’m dumb read last sentence again. weren’t senior I’d recommend taking easy courses right now, that’s likely option. I’m sorry advice probably doesn’t apply I’m going leave case anyone else reading might need hear it. really wish use low-income people like soapbox freedom one important things precisely much else set stone 

When conquer pandemic enough freedom fear mitigation measures taken away back I'll consider normal want go back wearing masks. miss spewing germs others faces. US fucking stupid. benefits? put signs, people want? /s know people hate Florida, etc. honestly, one knows guy's situation. He's best current life. telling people move nice rational thing say. hope State Government gets act together starts enforcing masks etc. They're going watch ERs fill capacity people dying parking lots. Let's see spurs action. Federal Govt's leadership complete disaster well (as obvious everyone point). think stories need told. Sure dummies going bars COVID spread people think one picture one party. makes sad. built career around higher ed admin online environments: best practices curriculum development, faculty engagement, student experience, etc. took time last year son everything that's happened, I've looked ways get back industry consult assist. 

The jobs there. Colleges universities pushing topics onto unqualified, inexperienced staff members budget cuts, librarian responsible training faculty use LMS. Forget best practice, basics. blame them, hate see wish could more. Won’t cook off? trying stickler here; legit question Yeah. Cant tell people do, turkey, apparently. lol god sub cluster fuck liberal bullshit. Huge surprise eases mind some, mRNA vaccines new think. Moderna working decade several human trials, going several I've seen, depends load, severity, etc. hospital one busiest EDs entire nation. busiest I've seen around 60 waiting spot ER. scans wait waiting room, matter doctors admitting discharging 50 beds making space. 

In department, sort ""fast track"" area less severe stuff like xray case experienced. go there, get read treated, good go. People usually less 2h total. 

I can't speak hospital, beds stay full around 5p midnight. empty beds I've seen filled within 10 minutes. probably depends manager duty, adept keeping staff patients moving. Spreading virus others isnt freedom. Like mask-denier going get shot...sure. Well going 10%. Positivity much harder predict depend testing. I'd say 10% bad all. Spring numbers much worse. That's great meme people Reddit circle jerk fact people turned away border. Canada Mexico rely us way much ever actually keep people out. muh freedom going eat? I’ve heard methods like that. I’d really like develop something like that, definitely takes him. I’m teaching something spring I’ve taught past, maybe could start smaller scale. keep teaching class, could build options time it’s like experienced. Playing devils advocate: 
21 days slow spread quickly becoming full year. 

So many people know don’t know make ends meet year; service industry wiped another round lockdown nail coffin many employers area. Lots hungry scared people there. ""Save Turkey. Stay Home eat regular year."" One top 5 causes death. Youre selfish ignorant. setting buildings fire instead! believe science!!!iii11i

/s might take month vaccine produce antibodies though. person wearing mask story picture person TV supposed matter? trying score political points? Careful... that's slippery slope trumpism. We're gonna hell time digging mess *because* majority Republican party lives fantasyland. definitely need pathologies left. think yourself. yourself. Selfishness.

People died virus. It’s insulting families people don’t take pandemic seriously. Hopefully still collect fur. Would shame kill benefit. That’s workers comp is. make newly disabled destroy what’s left health quality life fighting claims. literally tell paraplegics they’re able go back work.

I’m glad finally getting attention, 9/11 first responders. always hyping vaccine though. fault bunch voters opposite idea.   300k people dead less year. COVID cannot kill OP they're personal lockdown. heart rate usually hits 140 I'm panic attack terrifying. last minutes! America dumb fuck yo ""Herd Immunity"" theory tossed around like mad game volleyball. term used bane subs existence, now.

Looks like good sign science finally progressed this. good sign.  test 2.24 million people COVID-19 day city? Amazing! UK making lot noise wanting approve US, think that's driving it. EU follow. They're set late summer can't see long require vaccinations done enough ahead time taken effect everyone involved games well buying tickets view events person 

Especially Japan get's top things high vaccination rate negate risk clusters starting That’s financially logistically possible majority students. campuses completely shut break, even international students. 300k Americans disagree mean people ask can't make absurd laws rely people making good decisions. People general shown incapable making good long term socially responsible decisions.... use prompts laws get people halfway decent... approached like adults, didn’t work. approached like children, still don’t work. 

I don’t think anything work besides excising sources misinformation lead people stances. something similar happen 9/11 first time responders? thought before, large percentage population retired income taxes would less effective. Thanks pointing out. TIL think lot this.

I sometimes worry I’m aware enough- try be, best look variety sources. try stay date. could probably more, it’s depressing sometimes take step back sanity.

But talk friends legitimately idea. They’re intelligent people- maybe throw radio car news work. Thats it. news get 30 minutes newscast, depending source, likely biased... gives small sliver what’s going world.

Hell, cases, news covid, go way find it. It’s often mentioned news. doesn’t make front page anywhere often March, despite situation far worse ever.

It’s really shocking. People bring pissed governor locking closing things up,.. simultaneously know bad numbers are, spike occurred. one fucking year real excuse see family piss away?! Come people!

I work small office two others also contact exposed person throughout day. told today expected work wait exposed coworker's test come back action taken.

Probably another 24 hours most? I’m sure someone better answer this. Source: opinion higher test volume would waiting 5 7 days first test deaths happen nursing homes. That's completely false. 63% I'm still baffled people feel need stock toilet paper pandemic. mean covid make shit 24/7 I'm extremely nervous vaccine I'm pregnant. think recommended get baby born June, is, might hold data pregnant women.

Not this, business class least 25 people, drink service, food service. even two hour flight, every single person plane mask point. Business class least 30 minutes maskless, transmitting passengers.

South Dakota has...none that. Thus way import many cases back Feb/Mar send China's test kits countries? paying? I'll honest, seen enough data Sputnik sure. claimed ""effective"" 20 events. reference everyone else upwards 90 first eval.  strange keep hearing people say ""I want first"" - wont be! Healthy people wait months (hopefully) see makes difference they'll sing different tune. alot countries Europe started implementing restrictions like France, UK Germany went back lockdown cases inevitably start go again. Well great news. hello happening anytime soon really. know dont watch Fox news matter, consider nothing.

Some people plain ignorant themselves. he’s saying 99.9% death rate. comment sarcastic Why? 

Besides Sinophobia, course. normal covid-19? mutant strain Denmark read /r/covid19 Oxford trial tested participants weekly two tested symptomatic cases. Seems like testing everyone weekly would also drive apparent effectiveness including asymptomatic mild cases.

So seems like good news around. Science basically focused every resource COVID since February we've got point may vaccines calendar year.

Is chance people power money saying ""just keep single focus mentality see get breakthrough cancer quicker too"".

I mean, we've seen possible. try it? sincerely hope go back fragmented focus everything little bit real advancement. meaningless. dealing small number cases study, extra COVID cases make huge difference efficiency readout. data have, confident readout. start breaking sample smaller slices make study look better, looks weak.

When go regulatory approval, probably relying average efficacy. in-laws still believe less harmless regular flu. found out, next week pastor retiring small gathering. made plans wife visit following see grandchild. Let's say coming over. want jerk. I'm crazy, right? right! Cooper speaking later afternoon. 👏 Well obviously Noem could done much deaths per capita COVID state nearly identical. Thought already lol [archive link anyone trouble accessing article took part study skeptical results. Let explain:

In March taking care parents mom got sick. classic symptoms, able cajole way getting tested (when states refusing anyone deathly ill), tested negative PCR 7 days symptoms first appeared. dad symptom free.

Fast forward October get test kit seroprevalence. Unlike regular antibody test blood draw, use card bleed finger poke. [Also, say study website ""tune"" test way sensitive regular lab assay antibodies, seems like would introduce greater risk false got results back, tested present antibodies. parents also took antibody test (labcorp blood draw) tested negative antibodies. I'm skeptical numbers. depends fast roll vaccine. perfectly doable get majority vaccinated say April start rolling next month there's issues getting enough supplies vaccines. That's amazing. three effective vaccines combined already able cover large stretches world next year.

Hopefully nightmare finally end. mean adenovirus based vaccine would work subjects already taken one?

Yeah, doctors wearing masks since right around 1900 keep patients getting sick infections.


They even know viruses 1918.


Yet 100 years later trying explain luddites masks grand conspiracy make T-Rump look bad. Canada gov said back people 45 probably get vaccine 2022.
I assume agencies make sure every single country gets risk population healthcare workers vaccinated really fast. believe imminent return normality. Well, guess cant cosplay conventions closed....Um. Yeah.

Nice headline photo btw. weird interesting. Biontech German company, belongs two immigrants Turkey vaccine developed Germany. like: Humanity, fuck yeah.

Also, none would possible without scientists world contributing form research. Bravery ??? Disrespecting important safety measure since crap began call brave?. wonder cannot get rid COVID. Yet another narrative makes absolutely sense. hear every day. 

The virus flow air infectious aerosol ever gets intake location filtered out. 

It doesn’t go directly mouth intake. 

That means virus floats around airplane, past many peoples heads, potentially multiple infected sources ever gets taken care filtration.

*The reason everybody plane doesn’t get infected, they’re wearing masks.*

If aerosol virus floats past 64 peoples heads makes intake gets filtered well, yes, there’s benefit too. reason Ivermectin getting little promotion: pharmaceutical companies greasing right palms. money making bonanza going allow cheap patent medications ruin them.

Another success Operation Warp Speed. Many vaccines given multiple doses - MMR, Hepatitis B, HPV - it’s way fine tune response/result specific longer-lasting response. need multiple dosing wanted make money - would increase cost single dose.

They've probably gone vacation 5 6 separate times years, plane travel everything. I, child, immunocompromised. truly know would happen get covid. yet somehow still find ways manage make feel guilty wanting anything right now. 

I think main problem Americans entitled people world. Reasonable otherwise decent people can't fathom idea might make lifestyle changes collectively want get hand virus. go act like WE'RE crazy nervous virus killing literally hundreds thousands people. power refused anything it. saw CDC pleading Americans travel. literally always way. That's I'm hoping for, here's something consider - work one tour time. even there's twice many tours going out, still earn one paycheck. there's way recoup lost wages, bummer.  


It's also possible artists, hurting lost wages 2020, going scaled-down crew sizes order try make bigger profits 2021. result would fewer jobs industry, significantly harder workloads (which already pretty hard normal gigs). Oh, talk fans going everything afford - hit really hard year, chances able afford much next year.  


I think 2021 better year colleagues 2020, expect us start ""normal"" years 2022. I'd love wrong this, everything I've seen inside business, see 2021 amazing year artists people speculating. vaccines, doesn’t spread exponentially, flu control. would we? contagious without symptoms, develop... spreading unknowingly others might older comorbidities. upsetting people refuse wear masks distance. (Or, even worse, say ""If scared stay home!"") takes us adhering precautions get handle get back normal sooner. laws written rich ""people"" feel guilty  expensive private company Tens thousands people already taken various vaccines trials. first. Murica! favorite line: Gov. Abbott’s heart goes them. 

That’s hilarious, since aware shitstain doesn’t heart. Meanwhile... TSA reported millions passengers taking flights.

Also, successfully got refund American Airlines started second thought flying looking data living rock.  n=2741 way smaller number arrive conclusion? vaccine n ranges 20-40k live Europe, people fail high school maths struggle certain modules, might stats... Business usual America. They're lucky charged millions dollars medical care top everything. They'll probably applying UN certification least successful vaccine out.

Not good gold standard US FDA, good enough countries worldwide Something like 10% population age 10 under, people probably get vaccines yet Phase 1 Phase 2 trials tested vaccine safety young children. Eventually, they'll pediatric trials prove safety children, that's 10% population cannot get vaccinated.

At 90% efficacy, 90% vaccination rate (all adults young adults), 80% herd immunity level, vaccinating every single non-child country could approach herd immunity anyway... still less half number passengers flew days leading Thanksgiving 2019. nonetheless, it’s strongest three days since pandemic emptied American skies back March.

I know it’s still huge number people traveling reading decrease 10%. Right it’s close half number compared last year. That’s massive difference. serious question mix match vaccines? mean really need to, guys meet outdoor lots spacing ventilation(if weather permits) good distance like 5 meters mask medical grade mask respirator. Also, keep short. Good luck essential infrastructure falls apart there's one fix it. Without essential workers, there's power, internet, trash collection, farming, food packaging (so maybe population food lockdown fucked supply chain people starving), goods produced, hospital supplies replenished. Even strictest possible lockdowns, enough people still moving around spread plague. CDC saved pleas late. People made plans paid airfare. Well fair, Florida relatively low population density allows healthy lifestyle winter months, careful do. 

I'd imagine people staying condos / houses/ timeshares maybe Airbnbs, hotels. necessarily ""tourists"" rather part-time residents Florida. 

I'd definitely get NYC, Philly, Montreal, etc stay house/condo Florida winter instead situation. would also absolutely never go eat inside restaurant go bar indoors Florida pandemic. That's irresponsible. thinking vaccine technology yeah sure right Boy isn’t shame TSA powerless anything prevent this. have, sooner three months initial infection. recently recovered he’s protected antibodies. He’ll first group get vaccine hopefully year. We’re hoping he’ll OK then. finally provided full PPE job, people wearing surgical masks residents weren’t even required wear them. science behind “low transmission outdoors” still mostly based one study outbreak China (which happened winter...when people wouldn’t spent much time congregating outside first place). Correct. INJECT STRAIGHT VEEEIIINNNSSSSS! Im implying anti vax theories anything, world world people people always get suspicious anything goes well. 
I dont think lying padding stats, least want think would would erode credibility vaccines need most. 

But like us election..people think rigged without evidence people believe people tell believe.

Even though us efficacy isnt good, would prefer take oxford vaccine given choice. trust more. think bizzare all. fact, could make convincing argument quite opposite. 

People age 60 A) risk, probably likely stay isolated

and B) probably less likely essential workers

 C) less likely going bars house parties stupid stuff like 18-29 year olds

D) less likely live children exposed via school daycare middle aged folks sure decided 'big 3' ... malaria cause INSANE number deaths two all. relatively rare mild although kill people. would MUCH better focus causes diarrhea treating tuberculosis wanted prevent infectious disease deaths. 

Problem malaria caused entirely different kind organism likely can't vaccinated against. correct, count number friends personally know died. number 2.

My wife started taking vitamin supplements 2 months ago. Fingers crossed! think mean terms eradicating uncertainty worry Covid finally bringing finally justified flu like comparisons beat annual vaccines upcoming treatments like flu. long majority society keeps taking vaccines, sting Covid gone. It’ll another virus like flu cold handle certain medicine vaccines next big ones rolls around, hopefully way prepared. Melbourne: one short, hard lockdown.

Montreal: one never-ending soft lockdown.

It's crystal clear better strategy is. discouraged result it.

Nobody happy hoping people dying people literally sending death threats people trying save lives.

1) want take three vaccines.

2) wear masks take precautions. 


And almost always people. 

Can imagine one last people get virus die? tragic that? 

A vaccine available mean people take precautions almost over. get virus last couple months around, that's awful. Also 140usd month near poverty China many things actually subsidized schools hospitals.

Literally It’s really simple. culture eating shitty putting money unhealthy fast food chains perpetuates unhealthy lifestyles fills hospitals. pay healthcare unhealthy folk.

Swedish data delayed? remember first wave reporting delays always made look like curve dropping, forecast line shows, that's mirage.

Do countries similar large reporting delays? countries always report cases/deaths ""today"" (regardless actual timing), curve correct shape, data less precise? muh scaremongering hope so, there's also getting everyone vaccinated, many people vaccinated single day? assume 1 million vaccines administered day US, would still take 330 days vaccinate everyone. Actually Canada needs worried permits flights US. lot snowbirds US (literally read story CBC yesterday it) Florida full, doubt try fly back Canada treatment. Finally Pfizer Biontech, latter develops vaccine I’m checking life never normal folks wearing masks summer next year folks, bodies streets trolls, won’t leave house next year folks, How’s mental health holding up? sounds worse is. basically meat bone crispy skin it.

Still better 'Flu Vaccine' numbers still reduce thing nuisance (but ever present 'nasty flu') though. That's grade-A satirical writing. win Mencken award. forgot part island. put perspective, rate deaths nearly caught cancer heart disease. 

Per CDC, top three causes death pandemic: 1) Heart disease: 655,000/yr. 2) Cancer 599,000 3) Accidents: 199,000/yr.

At current rate, 535,278 additional deaths next 12 months. 

Can vaccine change that? Yes. Better work fast, though, number deaths per week accelerating.

Wear mask. Think God save religious? Believe away, necessarily save everyone around you. ""If can't wear mask protect neighbor, never, never talk God."" We'd run testing capacity long get there... someone ELI5 vaccine different mRNA ones? know mRNA ones work sure onenis different I'm hoping try ship Canada. 

I actually read another thread, ""Well hospitals over-flow, always Canada."" Wut? coronavirus sub. purpose. idea would know everyone believes risks new vaccine utilizing new technologies strains credulity.  state, rural population fought sued governor every mask mandate, shut down, mitigation, ect.

Now they're absolutely fire covid honestly, sympathy all. thumb nose science apparently ""a Chicago democratic big government conspiracy"" cry situation made worse willful violent ignorance. Seems like primarily reddior video gamer based much post. I’m sure that’s opinion formed I'm sure would lurking comments come defense easier produce distribute third world countries? rural hospitals closed. unexpected except drive rural areas.

Because idiotic health care system, rural hospitals simply can't afford stay open. Still another days yet, imagine there's going shift air travel automobile well. going difficult thing estimate around. restrictions travel 

Nope, planes kept flying (empty). well long stay away family, good Cries American conspiracy theories Got it. looks like Canada things control late August cases started shooting again. happened?

Vaccines wouldn’t that. side effects body would noticeable 99.9% showing relatively short amount time. 

Historically speaking, don’t think there’s ever vaccine long term side effects showed years later. I’m wrong please correct me. bartenders could would. past 4 hours, every state US except 4 leads google search: Covid testing

This one makes sense people seeking false security negative test visit family. necessarily take mean actively self-assessing symptoms. 

But ""Covid symptoms"" reassuring search term. Reality vaccine: 

""When last time took mask?""

""Yesterday.""

I meant, front someone else.""

*Gestures* ""I much older kids."" highly likely multiple vaccines approved vaccines approved faster vaccines available anyone wants them. Plenty medicine side effects, is. 

The second point dumb conspiracy theory territory. Like said, point making ""cure"" common cold virus every time mutates. specific vaccine Covid19, one saying immunity last forever, enough make pandemic way managable fucking pandemic.

The third dumb confirmation bias. vaccine foolproof way get Covid19. one cares got flu time get flu shot. YOU. Yes chances getting Covid19 actually dying really really small, think lottery winner kind life altering side effect vaccine science really experienced with?

I wish people would think big picture here, we're lot people you, think important part, realize equally shitty time everything everyone around goes even shit. 

So stop dumbass take vaccine, yourself, everyone else. mean, never chance *wouldn’t* return normal disease fatality rate 98% rate go care rationed.

So many deaths new york city places attributable lack resources. enough nurses, patients kept paralyzed sedated longer usual. Slower time extubate, greater rates reintubation, greater likelihood ventilator management suboptimal.

As week two ago, Utah started stretching thin, getting worse. case fatality rate go start providing worse care. GI stuff one I’ve watching closely. UC but, remission 4-5yrs now. heard people needing get som GI tract removals damage done Covid. 

Thank hard work dedication. even bother bringing something like ""incubation period"" clearly know enough kind conversation? References? kidding me? literally think makes perfect medical sense compare NFL athlete.

How this, get simple facts head:

1. overall health determines efficiency immune system

2. immune system deals viruses

So using simplest logic, see athlete gives much better chance surviving viral infection.

Maybe going fast you? seem way much trouble grasping obvious concept.  say bad. anything way said seemed like thinks good killer never dead know always right? aren’t many excess deaths time year. I'm skeptical even could gotten memory two people test negative, one person twice (PCR antibody). Since March I've working home living alone going stores inside buildings. Important note headline efficacy metric 70% (or 62%, 90%, depending measure it) apples apples comparison Moderna's claim 94% efficacy Pfizer's claim 95%.

The Oxford trials participants get tested weekly, thus revealing asymptomatic COVID cases counted COVID cases, believe Moderna Pfizer included cases participant symptoms. Exact this. legal ways help people die without pain suffering.

But need days/weeks realize.

If thats good bad depends single case. 

Thrust german law, really bad topic adenovirus vaccine, stronger first dose might provoke immunity vaccine Borders ports entry place US national government constitutional authority enforce public health measures. Everywhere else, make next, strip remaining scraps authority left national government manage pandemics?

I think make excellent point, I'm mistaken authority applies international arrivals departures. majority activity seen airports domestic travel, might trickier enforce. 

Of course, Department Homeland Security actively participating process I'm sure could extend shoe-bomb/full body scan mandates also check temperatures, contact tracing, etc. I've barely heard anything since began. Ah China, mess. strategy isn’t sustainable, tourism shut well many exports economy still suffering. mention they’re subject random lockdowns certain cities even one 2 cases Publix Carolina's 10 dollar gift cards...yeah Thank you.   quoting you, numb nuts.

Gotcha. Yes, preconceived notion welfare recipient. Send back.

I’m one them. 🥒 American, agree. danger others. one less effective much cheaper produce easier store. it’s probably better option developing countries fucked. Isolate get groceries delivered then, scared. right stop right stop them...  surge plan plan. everyone live city need farmers grow food. need cotton textiles. need soybeans food fuel. 

Yes, fuckton people live rural areas *don't need to* support industries need fuckton land. effective others? Takeout delivery high risk way communal dining is.

Most restaurants handle safely come brief period time mask; pay leave quickly. restaurants curbside pickup almost contact someone restaurant come puts food back seat.

Once masks come relatively small area going strong possibility people becoming infected contact. Even social distancing sitting long period time people wearing masks virus magically disappearing immediately outside.

One absolutely known risk factor length exposure amount viral load. Passing someone briefly street relatively low risk opposed sitting long period time.

And others pointed out, outdoor socially distanced dining really reality happening people congregating streets outside especially restaurant hipper type gathering spot. great race among 4 great nations. went months one giving ground. 

The first fall Russia. second bow Brazil. continued pace till 5mil. gave race. 

Then two left looked like young turk, India would get ahead. Record breaking 97K new cases single day, keeping million behind old master till 8mil. india's spirit broke started falling behind till reached current average 40K+ new cases. 

The grand old master, champion champions finally said 

""Enough, fuck ya'alls. lack spirit balls compete me, I'll myself""

And shined race, first breaking India's 97K record surpassing record 150k, 200k new cases. 

Once India kept million behind US. could manage million new cases time US 3mil. 

The US truly master, exceptional core. 

*Reading wrote made sad* That's main concern, yeah, mean realistically want get COVID either. work state run hospital I'm situation. get covid use sick time/vacation time. Yeah, better wording probably ""shutdown"", amount effect. No. Fucking. Shit. agree family course receive benefits, philosophically draw line? answer seems impossible here.

Putting onus applicant prove got work slimy mechanism employers avoid responsibility employee's health. Unfortunately, since nationwide (worldwide), exactly plethora medical personnel available.

“Nobody ever went broke underestimating intelligence American public.” haven’t hit dtla one yet one street always poppin. countries similar delays, hidden report deaths report date rather death date Sweden does. Thanks perspective! actually DM'd guy weeks back seemed experiencing same, brief bursts pressure day so, said went away year. I'm super worried, bit annoyance - still able workout everything fine.

Maybe guys rest us be, Cheers give up. many intelligent people sub. Y’all stay safe season. Lots nurses 10 Covid patients work. There’s way provide care people need. gonna best. However, hope folks keep healthy don’t end hospital. *do not* want inpatient right now. Remember cases regimes. So, among 131 infections, would expect 6-7 severe cases, none. Still small sample, bit positive. argument Canada Australia.

Really sure part getting.

That's like two people arguing Lambo Ferrari fastest chime saying Bugatti faster both.

Nobody cares part discussion.

Enjoy rest day, even waste time replying. 

I read it. 👍 always assumed test material fit, means material much effective cloth air moves it. Fit varies much person person mask mask can't imagine trying quantify it.

But air need come sides freely. tighten adjust fit create little leakage possible. always use paper clip clip ear loops around back head tighter fit. I've heard little under-mask face brackets help also, especially narrow face. playing around mask lays cheeks helps lot.  Joe Rogan just...dangerous. gives lunatics gloss normalcy helps shit enter mainstream. already know infevted people immunity 6-8 months minimum there's evidence may last years. Currently there's reason believe covid vaccine long lasting.

I'm testing. Test many people slow spread, vaccine end thing. keep quarantining? obviously assume people hanging homes without masks giving other. Spoiler alert: are. Boone, Iowa, March ONE respirator hospital. friend asked normally need to. “We borrow one Des Moines send patient there.” Oh again, still unable perceive type sarcasm. I'm right wing, never made predictions, making joke. Hope day gets better! Looks like oxford vaccine effective Pfizer It’s cold people like deadly others. say you’ll wear mask distance “when reasonable” you’re going feel really awful “reasonable” situation turns transmitting someone high risk. everything you. Stop selfish - don’t want vaccine fine, STAY CDC guided precautions you’re going way.

Edit: active member r/EndTheLockdowns...I’m shocked Thanks! key word reputable international companies. testing like March?
 
If today's testing capacity then, think people would gobsmacked cases circulation time.
 
People going travel they've decided getting virus 99%+ people survive low enough risk them.
 
The world need permission move on. It’s ridiculous original comment removed rude all. 
 
All said would surprised you, random Redditor, information actual vaccine developers didn’t have.

Also think distributed widely UK least, already big head start production here. EU would probably prefer BioNTech's US Moderna's though someone 30s, going last group receive anyway....

The main reason posted personally view news articles masking 1918 made 2020 blatant propaganda misinformation. people dig scientific journals pre-2020 articles, see it. 

Now people go 2 ways realize this. 

A) Misinformation ok achieves public masking

B) It’s ok mislead public.

Gee, wonder too. 🤔🤔🤔🤔 information already posted. Australia already started manufacturing too. incidence transmission hospital, quite lot. Masks silver bullet, combination distancing staying outside they're pretty effective. designed group sizes dosages themselves. must expecting sort different results beforehand. fluke? East low democracy index though Mind speculation side results way are. might completely different mechanism behind it. seems plausible enough me. enough doses one vaccine everyone. need vaccinate 7 billion people. companies estimating produce billion doses next year, even incredible feat. need vaccines get, every company, get done.

70% also fine. use plenty vaccines range (the standard mumps vaccine get baby, name one). dramatically giving two doses, plenty high enough hit reasonable herd immunity. Adenovirus carriers also new human vaccines, look insurer essentially putting onus family sue. civil court plaintiff, prove got COVID work private life - difficult probably trauma inducing family try recount activity.

Uh, no? would fishy? Unfortunately that's works. compromised immune systems often can't take vaccines, vaccines % people benefit shot. English isn’t good, China guy.

Also fine”. wow.

Good work. tracking chips put vaccine invade privacy. thing actually read article.

It's average 70% effective based permutations different doses they've tried. permutations much effective, ones actually going use.

This, way, true pretty much vaccine ever needed get multiple doses fully effective. So, MMR, shingles vaccine, HPV vaccine, bunch them: lower effectiveness one dose higher effectiveness multiple doses. 

We use ton vaccines 70% effective range one dose. Getting second dose (or case, second half dose) boosts percentage lot. That's second doses called boosters. right. commented read article. 90% effective GREAT especially easy 3rd world countries administer. 

Sorry dummy earlier corners cut. created record time, started 10 years ago. Life full mysteries. monetary issue primary power. Without stimulus, low wage workers need survive long demand Well constantly live prospect mutated flu. going firefight. understand mechanism, really think would wise. Exactly! trying figure bothers people say Pfizer vaccine, seem like want talk :( might right approval timeline visting care homes talk relation care homes given stock rapid lateral flow tests screen visitors. think it’s strange they’re speeding things thousands people dying every day?

There two ways speed vaccine development: cutting corners burning money.

These vaccines sped burning money: spending would normally spent especially taking huge financial risks running phases simultaneously rather one thing time.

But end result safe effective vaccine tested tens thousands people. There's reason tested dose. lower dose showed higher effectiveness could roll out. That’s cool, may name it? Mine stopped functioning  Even assume ""mutated Covid"" keeps ability transmit presymptomatically: 

1. sudden increase deaths non-immune populations would noticed quickly;
2. Local lockdowns would likely stop transmission beyond wide area sudden uptick deaths, compliance would likely high.
3. Even spread, great bulk population would vaccine-induced immunity, meaning R number, therefore caseload, going get crazy high.

For threat, it'd to:

1. Outlast vaccine-induced immunity (which could boosted people noticed waning immunity early adopters vaccine);
2. transmit another method bypasses vaccine;
3. Evade detection/lockdowns — could would much stronger MERS-like fatality rate.

While random mutation could happen time, selective pressure virus vaccine developed, become less deadly local populations bother getting revaccinated immunity fades. Immunity means protection disease, mean body able spread virus. Sterilising immunity means can't spread virus, really significant. Wow would incredible game changer, I'm glad it'd affordable vaccine world get.

Anyone know long till may see results mRNA vaccines?  can't wait never go subreddit Yeah, feel hopeful unlike normal anti-vaxxers, people particular vaccines actually swayed data. getting voted, vaccine used majority world. Oxford tried succeeded well. main one continue main one.

They created cheaper vaccine easy transport hold, vaccine 90% effective first inject half dose second.

You excited vaccine. real win. vaccines super hard transport. dope day/night. Thank you. kind information needs continually pushed out. Keep saying pushing everywhere can. anti vaxxers are, shitloads people fence. Thank-you clarification! it’s similar Australia New Zealand... except borders still closed non-citizens. Uk starting early december, recently leaked nhs documents show plan as:

Care home residents staff, healthcare workers - beginning December;

Ages 80 plus - mid-December;

Everyone aged 70-80 - late December;

Everyone aged 65-70 - early January;

All high moderate risk 65s - early January;

Everyone aged 50-65 - mid January; and

Everyone aged 18-50 - late January; bulk group vaccinated March. Well blow down, might way thing afterall. initial trials vaccine include people 18 (informed consent becomes lot tricky demographic). believe since expanded trial include people 12-18 range, since results yet, expect initial approval granted people 18 years above.

Once test results come younger people, approval likely expanded (assuming results good) timetable may amended point. people trying refute normal spring article we've saying insane thing I’m worried anti maskers anti vaxxers harassing people still spreading make worse like now. don’t understand people aren’t fined jailed risking others health stupid egos actually want understand issue, please research socialism communism, look China.

Convincing group vaccines safety essential high amount immunization. people idiots, need insight, understandable given studies hard interpret many.  That's pretty egregious straw man argument.

False. take large doses every months small doses daily. really need bother sooner weekly.

But want tested know levels low. point spending money levels normal. Plus without testing, know dosage enough not. I've never subscribed, want able ignore sub want to. However still come many times day... can't wait stop that. Symptomatic would better term. efficacy still gauged severe disease. That’s exactly educated science trolls Reddit do. don’t want believe simple. _Hamilton_ singalong? know way treatment way better.   I'm watching world burn island (iom) gets everything free covid since May.

It's fucking horrifying I'm outsider. stop testing 98% problem goes away. /s Thanks sharing reasoning, don’t think reasoning sound.

One. interesting story, unfortunately haven’t provided information here. drug? offered? problems wife have? particular doctor see unfortunately known taking sponsorships drug companies?

I also feel like reaction situation might’ve find different doctor versus never listening doctor’s suggestion experimental drug again.


Given disease hasn’t existed five years, feel like can’t fault they’re five years worth clinical studies. also feel like trying new vaccine killed Americans months soldiers died combat wars entire history nation kind different thing.

So, five years rule makes sense comes therapies cancer. father-in-law type cancer survival rate increased years many years thanks therapies come last five years. followed five year rule, would probably dead. cancer drugs experimental many cancer therapies cause long-term side effects. Cancer still wild west. That’s comes humans diseases. Like going say following oncologist lunch get cancer? gonna die?

 Two. think understanding backwards here. I’ve heard common colds caused coronaviruses. much rhinovirus coronavirus relatives. 

I don’t find fact vaccine eight months suspicious, colds don’t kill anyone. whole Covid thing kind big deal right now. course bump top priority! also, cold describes bunch similar symptoms, they’re caused many different viruses. also, sniffles, doctor going try swab nose run DNA test see particular virus was. It’s sniffles. I’m already better.

There’s several reasons vaccine timeline quick. first almost soon disease recognized, Chinese researchers sequenced genome published everyone see! Isn’t technology wonderful? one piece needed make vaccine beginning! fortunate thing biology failing slightly way virus reproduces harder, impossible mistakes made reproduction, called mutations. yeah, tell virus circulating around United States came Italy China, it’s still similar enough original one keys still work. DNA code creation proteins. One proteins spike protein sits surface virus. Recognizing particular protein shapes bad making antibodies attached immune system kill viruses recognize specific invaders. spike protein star show.

The mRNA technology used vaccines come ago, good thing try on. There’s sudden demand vaccines generally, usually people get certain ages predict much need make. making technology instantly manufacture something high development list wasn’t need it. One use cases make vaccine really fast. That’s traditional vaccine give copy dead weakened virus body finds makes antibodies matched surface proteins time don’t get sick. Instead mRNA vaccines make one spike protein. MRNA stuff interfaces DNA body’s protein manufacturing Ribosomes. It’s stuff reads DNA genetic code actually expressed make RNA lab. Especially they’re cheating making RNA codes one tiny part virus, it’s one matters. vaccines made virus parts, grow takes year. new vaccine difference adding chemicals milk making ricotta cheese hour kitchen, versus aging Parmesan 24 months. cheese, one takes while.

The thing made vaccine development go quickly government promised buy doses failed told vaccine manufactures make test distribution stuff once. Otherwise, would starting scratch couple weeks. Instead, made along, smartest thing could’ve possibly done. government intervention, pharmaceutical companies would’ve unlikely spend billions dollars kind gamble.

Three. probably coincidence. I’ve gotten flu vaccine off, mostly on, I’ve never gotten flu. likely case exposed flu years, part people got vaccine prevented spread. 

One day, visiting nephew one, helped feed highchair. thought would funny game fed food. loved it, though got gross baby fingers mouth. Less two hours later started feeling sick went home. later found flu! never got it, maybe stuck disgusting baby hands mouth instead sneezing face, vaccinated get flu absolutely close contact pre-symptomatic individual.

Also, sure even influenza? many people call random disease involves getting sick winter influenza, even it’s confirmed infection.

Finally, extremely important every year flu vaccine covers three strains prevalent end last flu season. takes many months grow vaccine parts flu virus gas one ready time next fall. lot time, guesses wrong. shown got vaccine wrong strain flu, lessen severity disease. We’ve already seen that’s case Covid vaccine. Anyway, I’d love see mRNA technology applied flu they’re working something date takes fucking forever grow virus parts chicken eggs.

Four. It’s weird see worry risk dying Covid, concerned long-term side effects vaccine. long-term side effects Covid? certainly exist. Covid fucked lot people up, probably permanently.

 also 34 years old pretty good shape. doctors love see wellness blood test numbers. good cholesterol good. would touch getting virus 10 foot pole. I’m worried dying, worried long-term physical disability. know women age Covid long haulers indication gonna happen them. think special, suggest go running forums start reading stories people excellent physical condition go check stories professional athletes who’ve really bad time virus. 

I sick often, truly sick, find experience mere fact existing deeply deeply unpleasant. don’t care sick two weeks straight hell virus.

As claim ""long lasting symptoms"" certainly majority cases much yet understood so-called ""long haulers"". claim limited evidence support wide-spread issue.
 
As three days ago, CDC reported cumulative hospitalization rate 228.7 per 100,000 population.
 
A far cry erroneous figures 5 - 10%. lead ""more deaths"" fatality rate considers deaths due covid regardless hospitalization status.
 
Regardless, point combat claimed falsehoods, point individual risk/reward calculations people derived back March shifted November. see living life important contracting virus knowing data points. advanced track HS geometry, algebra 2 (included trig), pre-calc, calculus. normal track began algebra 1 ended pre-calc.

Then college (engineering) calc 1, calc 2, calc 3, differential equations, advanced math variant.

That’s basing on. point pet think inconsistent part reading report. 

“That's vaccine might stop getting virus, it'll protect getting sick.

And matters everyone still get virus infect others, large numbers people unprotected?”  real incredibly smug, out-of-touch statement. me, health care leaders saying use sick time week vacation, well telecommute, 5 weeks COVID one test able get negative (this March), even tho doctor diagnosed anyway due symptoms wasn’t allowed go back office. boss tried force apply short term medical. COVID charge code, forbid use it. It’s bullshit. That's almost impossible know certainty way virus behaves near zero contact tracing. It’s fantastic. hit stride quickly it. orders came vaccines announced. IDK pessimistic, I'm hoping caution. explained one article. lower dose means stronger immune response excess deaths negative peak indication people died peak would survived long anyway.

79 studies (5340 individuals) SARS-CoV-2, eight studies (1858 individuals) SARS-CoV, 11 studies (799 individuals) MERS-CoV included. Mean duration SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding 17·0 days (95% CI 15·5–18·6; 43 studies, 3229 individuals) upper respiratory tract, 14·6 days (9·3–20·0; seven studies, 260 individuals) lower respiratory tract, 17·2 days (14·4–20·1; 13 studies, 586 individuals) stool, 16·6 days (3·6–29·7; two studies, 108 individuals) serum samples. Maximum shedding duration 83 days upper respiratory tract, 59 days lower respiratory tract, 126 days stools, 60 days serum. Pooled mean SARS-CoV-2 shedding duration positively associated age (slope 0·304 \[95% CI 0·115–0·493\]; p=0·0016). study detected live virus beyond day 9 illness, despite persistently high viral loads, inferred cycle threshold values. SARS-CoV-2 viral load upper respiratory tract appeared peak first week illness, whereas SARS-CoV peaked days 10–14 MERS-CoV peaked days 7–10.

### Interpretation

Although SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding respiratory stool samples prolonged, duration viable virus relatively short-lived. SARS-CoV-2 titres upper respiratory tract peak first week illness. Early case finding isolation, public education spectrum illness period infectiousness key effective containment SARS-CoV-2.

You see things go.

Imagine large meeting table. one side board directors Pfizer, corner sits PR manager side heads science departments researching vaccine.

And PR guy asks; 'Can make public statement vaccine 90% effective?"" Board looks people white lab coats. say: 'Well, *in principle* say yes careful overstate still things EXACTLY sure studied vaccine yet 3 years...'

And Board says 'Wonderful! take yes! world looking us all!' lead scientist goes: 'Wait minute, would like time to...' PR guys says 'I'll go draft statement! investors shareholders want know all!'

'Indeed, says Board, agreement?!?!', raised eyebrow somewhat dangerous look eye, staring guy white coat.

And lab chief researcher cracks whip... people get human, make mistakes, compromise possible without detection. whgen clever chemistry student says: 'Ummm, RNA issue (or whatever)...' told stfu. time. Focus that. look issues later, may even issue... But..but..

And group think well established. People look away, fall line.

They performed two studies. One 8900 people got two full dowses month apart. second one, 2700 people got one half dose full dose month later. first study got \~62% efficacy, second 90%. combined efficacy 70%.

What people mention though, two studies equal. vastly different numbers participants thus different confidence ranges. second study could real efficacy 90%, 100% 50%. even 10% 2700 participants lucky. reason many people needed study combine two studies analysis get reliable number.  Communists, commonly known days, rose twitter.  UK bought doses vaccines significant numbers.

The Oxford/Astrazenica vaccine one ready rolled en-masse kind timescale outlined above, however. hyperbole idiots.

You got right. vaccine coming masses next year, what's long term goal? going get vaccine, know every 6 months? mean, like normal flu seasonal take one every year. Also, happens normal flu shot? know dumb question, get shots once? Thank God scientists scientific method!

China’s vaccine effective retroactively cure people already died covid. invade Taiwan. first enough doses experiments. agree. really need study this? mean test lot find lot separate spread around. study need, waste money... get sentiment. risk hand technically proven safe goin die  It’s triumph science, honesty reporting data science. 

It also illustrates people don’t understand statistics past headline! 

Imagine said 90%, antivaxxers would said lying.

I’d rather facts people didn’t understand exaggeration cherry picks figures. seriously whatabouting Holocaust? Doesn’t report released Astra Zeneca state dosing regimes returned statistically significant results? Someone math margin error would large. Probably fluke, 70% much certain. Brazilian? yes, get tested want so?

I live India city next Delhi, city one largest outbreaks. easy get tested right already city live in. call number testing lab, come house, get tested positive, someone tells medicines delivered hospital. friend experienced got tested Covid. 

Do idea experience Brazil? Look gerrymandering voter suppression, get back me. Watch parties night probably contributed lot outdoor neighborhood celebrations. believe you, harm trying. expecting worst family surprisingly chill this. may stories like may tempered expectations. one ten applicants actually need assistance mine necessary cost. politician actually died COVID? Given fact GOP fucks get virus high risk category find statistically improbable none died gotten extremely ill. Except Christie, nearly everyone gotten basically fine? CFRs hospitalization rates looking like days?  disagree. Antimaskers twats. Anyone else worried side-effects rushed testing? fact universal health care part DNC platform pandemic tells everything need know America. Schools finally close much argument government experts *sighs American* fucked day one federal plan. Literally need get everybody 6 weeks food. Everybody (literally) doctor dying stays home. essential worker bullshit. Everybody brief quarantine bam plague over.

But piecemeal half ass shit perpetuating pain. terrifying thing governor good part Texas GOP considers *moderate*.

They'll probably nominate mutilated corpse Mussolini 2022. Y’all pussies don’t go bar still afraid big bad virus, losers never even left house covid Yikes, feel you. caretaker, think reasonable thing either veto trip make care conditional willing risk life stupidly. all, one mop consequences. saying wrong honestly corner could possibly cut? following standard protocols data still reviewed scientists agencies.

If significant wide spread side effects show 30-
40K subjects trials running on, see would show regular population. would love see past instance it.

The thing skipping long immunity actually lasts side effect shows like couple year. 

Now first issue understandable concern. know enough know immunity ends even does. stop us using vaccines.

The second issue interesting, say, look past. look present. vaccine related long term complications. vaccines follow principles different. Also, back point, real fear. Thousands dying daily millions getting irreparable lung damage. Right now. maybe little risk fine dandy considering cost is. 

On general note, vaccines unloaded public without scrutiny. allowed jump lines queues.

If feel comfortable it, take it. bookmark post. 5 years line turns everyone dead vaccine, give permission come laugh highly improbable vaccine induced death. That's way optimistic. possible probable. forgetting part, relevant question. wonder trial stacks Pfzer/Moderna terms picking positive cases.

Like press release cases presenting compatible symptoms tested virological confirmation COVID-19 PCR. addition, **weekly swabbing done detection infection** assessment vaccine efficacy infection. 

The UK trial, Brazil one Suspected cases presenting compatible symptoms tested virological confirmation COVID-19 PCR.

Clearly already big difference two. Moderna/Pfzier testing present symptoms would understandably difference two. needed medical check work visa Greece. supposed psychiatric physical check including x-ray everything. asked envelope cash signed papers. refused would turned application.

Greece without doubt corrupt country Western/Southern Europe. Corruption part every day life here. No, spending tax payer money. spending money programs benefit tax payers. Yes. also consider lawlessness windows lobby building smashed mulitple times. may impressive previous two, far cheaper easier transport. It’s 90% effective one two dosing regimens. Keep mind literally less 10% price Moderna Pfizer ones. probably end used vaccine globally. Yeah violates 14th amendment vaccine free US citizens dw actually saying less american.  course would be, like Canadian grocery store various companies groups around world.

Say one thing (because free), pay people hero's pay first responder pay $2 hour? Nah discontinue brag quake profits No. law says. even really political, fact party platform. Yes I've looked AZ press release breakdown distribution covid cases (131) two regimens. likely 90% result infections coupled small dataset (n=2741) compared 62% one (n=8895) I'm pretty sure scientists behind still ready declare victory yet... Seriously. feels rude. Hey, wrote PM CPR question reddit year ago. I'd love could find time read :)  live, provincial government makes decisions based outbreaks show up. problem that, already made decision late. you’re reactive virus lose.

But also said restrictions decided consultation business community, medical community.

It’s wonder cases per day capita Canada. personally like details correct. important worth two minute Reddit post reckon. quintessentially Texan underrated general 👍 ... bromance Grant Sherman one ages. They'd say saline injections honest. oh sub news rich white celebs politicians caught it? foh valid running story fat christie dumb gulliani’s son caught it. don’t like it? don’t click. *sigh* guess would watch. fucking end us already. did. Nurse practitioners physician assistants manage without supervision missed 95% effective figure indicates effectiveness infection. 100% effective preventing severe disease/death. Hey, hit bottom, one way left go! long, looong way think rail extension delays Canadian problem?

Those people taking whatever precautions necessary protect themselves, government focusing best protect individuals like ... hindering harming lives people would statistically 98% recovery rate. Check Rhode Island, Ocean State! It’s beautiful! 

I bet every state sub, many cities. Providence sub gets posts every week someone (often TX FL) asking it’s like live here.

My family emigrated Netherlands. care opinion now? Want hear grossly miunderstanding modern republican views? think worse people thanksgiving fine. So, think Xmas fine too, virus much prevalent late December. questions supposed ask much money stake -- think people cautious vaccines await mass-rollout-testing results might right.

Let's see results 1 million people vaccinated, we'll see clearly. Death tribunals, GOP warned them.


Oh wait...  &lt;“They stations hallways,” Pate said. “They patients hallways curtains trying privacy. It’s like playing Tetris hospital equipment.”



""Normal life!"" U.S.

/$ Welcome beloved home state! hope enjoy here! aware take necessary steps protect likely get infected, right?

You aware responsible health, responsible mine, right? stupid strong one. Man, America great? One's country must absolute hellhole even consider migrating US.  statistic unreliable. We’re right go 70% combined figure (remember 62% effectiveness overall) data released. preliminary results small sample sizes BBC since edited headline linked article - mods same? That's strange, recovered COVID march get HR \~150bpm without feeling sort ache chest. Cut back training month everything returned normal. That's 95% efficacy means. mean people got vaccin, 5% got sick. means people got sick, 5% got vaccin (and 95% placebo).  actually joke. Vaccines make carrier.. statistic unreliable go combined figure 70% (remember 62% effective overall) data released. small sample size preliminary results. Yeah, first sure vaccines 90-95% effective one two doses. Looks like 70% indeed comparable numbers we're seeing, might increased first dose halved. Since vaccines coming closer closer big steps happy about. 

I since questions left find reliable source about. 

Can anyone recommend source stated difference vaccine others take years develop sure safe? 

Thank advance. Yup, true Pfizer/Moderna data well, believe, say ""70% effectiveness"" actually increases 100% goal avoid severe infections (which potentially important goal). statistic unreliable go combined figure 70% (remember 62% effective overall) data released. small sample size preliminary results.

See [this There's speculation 1/2-then-full dosing effective full-then-full induced immune system reaction chimpanzee adenovirus vector first full dose, reduced effectiveness booster immune system targeting adenovirus platform. read one comment day said: “Imagine every single person ever met life, dead” hits hard. dripping Rudy. viral vector vaccines new well Zero effort troll... Pfizer Moderna similar asterisks. final analysis showed 95% overall effectiveness. different vaccines this.

This statistic misleading go combined figure (62% general, 80-90 half-dose) data released. small sample size well.

See [this  Trump family already got virus though... wife’s best friend one them, flying Hawaii vacation next week. layover Seattle tried guilt wife meeting layover. put foot said isn’t happening. wife friend pissed think overly conservative high risk group. one cases none it.  member service industry, never worry making Thanksgiving plans. year like every other, wine tacos! think showing proof you’ve vaccinated become regular thing. least places make effort control it. Let's hope get cliffhanger ending. That’s Tony’s special pizza extra organic taste 'Could', probably guys anything organizing it. Welcome world outside USA. I've telogen effluvium major illnesses twice life, way covid. autoimmune disorder, get hit strep flu harder most. normal thing happens body's resources stretched, stops hair growing. body recovered new hair starts growing *all once* old, halted strands get pushed *all once*.

My honest suggestion women chop hair off, get wigs wait growback period. last time, much happier. piles hair around chair pick up, wild unevenness makes look like showered brushed.

I got wigs www.wigisfashion.com got nothing compliments purple hair, great. Probably since even Taiwan Vietnam aren’t discussion, akaik. That’s unreliable stat. data released go combined figure 70%. [See  Somehow miss numbers look daily counts. Like yes, 1,956 deaths lot 205,000 new cases lot, number add up. accurately, tell body make antigen. dont want click. Copy paste Quebec larger first wave ability test people. ability provide mass covid tests cases less deaths per case. Manitoba hand never really first wave. current cases prairie province's probably least 10x bad reported numbers. 90% stat unreliable shouldn’t using data released.

See [this handful countries punching consistent zeros determined lie. 80-90% one unreliable stat now, make good interim vaccine poorer possible drive, someone pick up? news, cities world report roughly one third population already antibodies SARS-Cov-2, go up. Combined several vaccines available shortly, herd immunity well threshold preventing community spread know it. Good bye closed businesses forced behavior!  funny comment  However truthful is, always people like denying it. truthfully, that's America does. Except countries strict lockdowns Covid.  I’m new CA. people hate much? I’ll alone well, don’t want kill mom Christmas. 

That said, I’m making good Italian. I’ll workout morning continue binge watch Criminal Minds. It’ll also around 68* later sunny I’ll read porch later. 

It’s gonna great. keep talking facts, sending opinion pieces, hard data back points? 90% plus 70% equals 160% yeah you’ll good. selfishness is. They'll probably better. Oxford vaccine comparatively low levels neutralizing antibodies vs mRNA vaccines, prevent infection animal models. best vaccine going Sanofi protein-based product, makes many antibodies insane.

Also worth noting Moderna's vaccine stable 30 days refrigerator, 12 hours room temperature, think indefinitely -4 degrees Fahrenheit. know they've making mRNA vaccines years, tested functionally-identical products temperature stability. BioNTech says product needs -80 freezers stable, truth tested stability warmer temperatures first mRNA vaccine they've made. likely -80 temperature recommendation overkill, testing indicate vaccine capable transported stored much higher temperatures. Moderna one £25 Pfizer one £15. one £5, quite.

I also think might used lot initially, better vaccine’s get released (Novavax’s, Imperial College’s), usage drop quite lot. makes perfect sense. Thank explaining me. One aspects thats pretty specific SARS-CoV-2 highly conserved (the virus even brings RNA proof-reading genome it), especially Spike protein target vaccines. viruses, especially influenca, much higher variability makes designing vaccines harder. way got lucky Covid, like seasonal flu shots mixed protection winter there's new strain.

From technological point view, new mRNA vaccines good step forward. easy mass produce able used purposes (possibly cancer treatments). major downside necessary cooling RNA quite fragile.  double dose standard dose. 90% figure 1/2 dose + full dose. stat however unreliable.

See [this That's major part moved Japan 20 years ago. Houston, still cesspool idiocy. lot people take vaccine see everybody else taken fine “at capacity” isn’t light switch. flexibility slack medical system operates. 

I’ll use region example I’m familiar it. Miami hospitals reached capacity August. able cope working double triple shifts. brought unrelated specialties, like dermatology. Infection rates dropped crisis passed. 

Measures work, temporarily. Doctors can’t work 100 hour weeks forever. hospitals reach capacity time eats slack - can’t transfer patients can’t bring traveling help. That’s scenario we’re approaching. happens patients sent home die, aren’t quite sick enough (which result death). beds enough nurses manage patient load, people die. December bring. don’t change course January even worse. 

This called greatest public health crisis since 1918 reason. many essential workers required sign Covid - 19 weiver.
I swim coach public pool. need open. necessarily essential all. Ppe = given face shield... Told sign covid - 19 weiver order return work. lose Unemployment stead long time job pt time $11 hr. . work 0-12 yr Olds mostly. sign weiver sick. pay system. get usually hourly bonus $2. However bonus blackmale. bonus incentive go work because... whatever reason work shift, take bonus whole check want to. Sick? Emergency? Requested time inconvenient....

Somehow.... Unemployment pay system, minimally reduce hours meant time eopened Oct... owed unemployment $160. thought virus care old are? Putting inexperienced fools charge things long agree him.  little red planes plague inc game. I’m crowd, point hypocrisy see it. expected bad that's disappointingly low. Meanwhile Aus, following lock luck America probably issue future uptake common issue early parts rollout supply short &amp; even pro-vax may sceptical taking vaccine new? vaccines made mandatory past long general population already got them? many vaccines made mandatory year public launch? ""rationing care"" works US ? ethic committee gives national-wide recommendation ? doctor charge decide (with risk lawsuits, sanction board) patient pays gets bed ? think everyone figure level risk want take. it’s losing depression going walk friend choose walk. still gotta smart it. Wear masks, don’t touch, wash after. safe Yeah, socioeconomic destruction left wake going take lot longer repair development vaccine. Sadly, answer Thanksgiving anyway extended family. Wait, *now*? They're making decision now?? I'm willing one first people take it. I’m personally concerned vaccine safety. one last ones get one I’m higher risk group. time get likely close year since development started many given ahead me. Important information might missed reading headline, pointed dosing regimen (n=2,741) showed vaccine efficacy 90% AZD1222 given half dose, followed full dose least one month apart, another dosing regimen (n=8,895) showed 62% efficacy given two full doses least one month apart. combined analysis dosing regimens (n=11,636) resulted average efficacy 70%. results statistically significant (p&lt;=0.0001). contains copies dead 14 week old fetus 1960s... light everything, actually expecting like 3 4 10. Nothing title actual Greek article! 
Fake news OP! Pretty much. wish companies regularly would receive fines kind consequence. 

Like certain % approved claims originally denied something. far common. Full dose , 30 Days, full dose 60%

Half dose, 30 Days, Full dose 90%

They still research optimal dose

(Memory reading Article cant remember trustfully was) really makes rest us christians look bad. jesus said love one another, spread deadly virus. want vaccine im genuinely concerned side effects. Titles reddit cannot edited. That... doesn’t sound legal?

Welcome 70 years weakening Labor concept ""Right Work"" states! disagree. underestimate little employers want deal covid. Many employers jumped masks quickly, well- want deal section general public wear overly violent. giving indications mandatory  Yeah, really news matters, even efficacy rate. prevention onset severe COVID-19 always goal. lawsuits pandemic malpractice skyrocket medical costs. beginning realize restaurant owners rely restaurant feed families pay bills, right? needs stimulus intervention point. even two four weeks detrimental business. live USA 1 million? 10? 100? 7 billion? Point being? transmit virus, people feel virus could kill ones properly locked up. dad instead sitting home waiting liver transplant decided go massage cought it, brought home mother cancer. sad, die, going blame spreaders, rather blame lack precaution parents known better... roller coaster me. 

These soaring highs felt accomplishment modern science, counter balanced crushing sadness (probably) 250,000 deaths US *alone* (sorry world statistics hand - equally tragic). 

Maybe EUA's (and countries equivalents) lessen overall deaths though....but still. still lot dying come cry happy tears all. Frozen food, virus. Fresh food? Rots day it’s dropped house (literally). Damnit I’m far work. it’s same. don’t get old booth. 

Is is. sucks. r/antiwork would like recruit you. I'm sorry, think BioNTech one does? source info? People avoiding question nobody knows would happen disease, might trouble ro create herd immunity different results depending half dose, trying work head. 

Would half dose essentially group scout bandits immune system basically thinks “what fuck this?!”, rounds boys fights full dose given, immune system ready opposed surprise attack full dose first time round? Insurance companies wait enough people die affects still turn profit later overAll less pay out. even close vaccine prospected profits incentive. Good luck NGO government make vaccine scratch. recruitment process would taken now. work like that.

ALL vaccine research/manufacture global effort undertaken large multinational companies. competition see nation produce 'effective' vaccine.

Different pharmaceutical companies chosen take different approaches; partly dont want everyone's eggs one basket, also for-profit organisations targeting different parts market looking differentiate products.

The Pfizer Moderna vaccines use completely novel process eliminates need 'harmless' virus carry COVID proteins body.   human immune system extremely effective given chance sometimes neutralise viral vector chance deliver 'payload'.  Logically, really expect effective traditional vaccine like Oxford/Astrazenica one.

But completely new process never seen outside laboratory before. relatively expensive, tricky manufacture, store distribute. Astrazenica produce traditional vaccine significantly cheaper, much easier manufacture, store transport, importantly GOOD ENOUGH allow semblance normal life resume, that's massive win them. everybody saying flu will.expect.first class hospital care need it. Colleges require it, like require proof meningitis vaccination now. Hospitals, nursing homes, etc. require staff like require flu vaccines tuberculosis testing now. Probably K-12 schools enforce like enforced H1N1 ten years ago. alone help great deal. legal, is. Indianapolis 12K people football game last night ffs Shed tear? I'm going weeping dangerous ""both sides argument"". Comparing antivaxxers believe vaccines safe like comparing flat earther someone believes able avoid climate change without drastic loss life collapse. first one wrong much really hard argue explain, second one might bit optimistic knows. reason already vaccine fast prospected profits take incentive away would need wait 5-10 years longer get similar vaccine. really hard grasp pharma companies investing lot ressources want get return investment / infrastructure / expertise / etc... Take away helpless hopeless next upcoming pandemic one put effort new vaccine anymore. also bright eyed optimist thinking people embrace logical solution works free world. Look around you, people wearing masks skip vaccine. caused tremendous flareup happening continue cause them. way vaccination also entry way spot (5min) testing. enter public space either need present non expired test don’t one receive free test. It’s “fearing covid”. It’s compassion towards vulnerable yourself. lives worthless. think key word “consistent”. Even Fauci politicians federal, state, local level contradicting reality covid. everyone news junkie, hear example restaurants open indoor dining think “oh, well must safe then!”. sucks, that’s are. *joe rogan breathing heavily* get office suite multiple doctors nurses like Trump. ride around hospital limousine breakup boredom maybe sneak McDonalds drive through. think super underrated comment. Yeah, 90% fantastic feasible goal, 70% accessible also really, really good. point easily accessible, safe, reduction capacity help. slows rate people overwhelm healthcare system, that’s win. start attacking effective vaccines   makes absolutely sense.

""This fire extinguisher successfully put every fire could happen tests.....seems fishy, let's use it."" AMERICA FUCK YEAH, LICK BUTT SUCK BALLS.

Little know, towsrds countries. american citizens. Also, may prevent infection around 70% vaccinated, good, also may provide protection severe symptoms 30% doesnt gain full immunity. may still barrier protection vital. companies made vaccines said risks highest risk people know want biggest get togethers.  biggest covid denier know mid 70s severe asthma. Seemed like starting understand minute, they're back thinking big thing all. heard morning hospital north us full shipping people out. Lets say go store, buy stuff, bring home. get COVID that's time outside house weeks. 

Is contract tracer going think got food package breathing store? Thanks work! Thanks letting know. try reserve judgement media facts out. there's robust testing already swine flu vaccine had. get rid incentive big pharma even produce vaccine fast costs effort return. Sure next pandemics waiting happen due mass animal farming. different vaccines numbers analyzed reported independent agencies - no, gone lied. anyone know prevents infection disease? I’ve gotten those! like “wtf?!”  eat, plain white bread? Pork knuckles fantastic. Chunky bit meat wrapped fatty tissue, oven baked crispy crackling outside, perfect Efficacy rate might high, however vaccine majority world get. Pfizer Moderna vaccines excellent, countries can’t afford believe U.S. maybe Canada Australia mass use them. Europe, Africa, Latin America Asia mostly go Oxford one maybe Sinovac one China. Covid-19? Return sender... disagree. instance, local contact tracers trace back contacts one day positive test. actual argument someone insisted meant infectious long felt unwell. infectious longer tracers would go back farther, right? NFL- hear player exposed, give test, three days later he’s good go. consistent message sent. willfully ignorant, yes, working incomplete information. don’t know week feel sick. don’t know faulty tests are. lots people like mom deniers, don’t pore news spend hours reading details. might understand it’s serious say government still failed them.

The government made damn sure knew fill envelope mail ballot. couldn’t get away ads, everywhere. feel like still recite it. wish taken coordinated effort situation. Yeah, early subscriber sub switched places (that weird). barely pay attention numbers state drive visit every again. There's much far precautions go. America gonna America North Dakota South Dakota running neck neck worst response COVID19 measured cases per million people. Seriously. almost feel like weird crackpot discussing vaccines positive light. Almost everyone know thinks government gonna inject alien goo. Whenever invention gets misattributed Reddit, always gets attention. little annoying right company getting credit. don’t know evolution work pretty fast- someone might workout fly hit ground weighted average Formal happen. neither experts apparently. I.know viruses ""conventional"" vaccines, carrier time yes. general rekommendations focusing amount supplemenation really wrong approach focused blood levels. state/governor really respected handling situation California measures taking protect people. 

Then dined out...wah wah

I wish harm hope speedy recovery. Just...dang dude. go something stupid like that? from? Yall mother fucking national guard help bodies. normal. needs stop. Something needs change. Now. Ok, mistake then. People stripes get looked country getting food assistance, unfortunately. understand correctly that's related type regimen used person-to-person variation; effective dose regimen hit 90% whereas less optimal 62% way read last week two weeks ago matter disputed lawful foundation missing fact ""illegal"". probably straight illegal contestable difference law terms although something contestable illegal point simply defined act situation specific laws pandemic situation like (same thing case countries). They're panic buying TP know going get bad, thing going make bad, therefore ensuring need hoard TP.

The lack logic impressive. Given seem know shit this, know whether safe effective get one earlier vaccines come out, Sanofi one later? Yes no. similar MERS vaccine developed tested volunteers 2018 (but never needed mass vaccination). 2 years data volunteers, show significant long term side effects.

Man, [you kidding](http://www.opensecrets.org/2020-presidential-race/sector-totals?sector=F). includes non-campaign money, yowza. There's natural immunity gained via infection well. surprise 20% population infected time vaccine widely available spring. overlap (people infected also get vaccinated), 60% population getting vaccinated + natural immunity gained prior infection= sense normal again, especially majority risk group vaccinated.

We're lucky vaccines looking incredibly effective. explain that? certainly unlikely point something statistically significant mean can't fluke. seems deficient real issue  hold vaccine taken hold. Alaska next August books rolled over. Fingers crossed right direction then. USA #1!!! Bon fuckin’ voyage totally agree Don’t worry. Gov. Foghorn Leghorn looking us. brought back football!

Even people dying, still get sick. many people getting sick lead triage rationing healthcare. also susceptible mass death event natural disaster terrorist attack. fucked situation, one things CAN'T change without collective people opting taking action change. 

I completely agree; first responders soldiers earn respect. position, more-so risk willing take cause/people. ultimate sacrifice. never want people change minds?

Yep. also see lot ""I got shot still got possitive Covid almost died!! vaccine WORTHLESS!!!Thank god Dr. Oz, super red currents superfood supplement saved life! barely felt sick 2 days, completely well!"" stuff.

Humans gonna human. 

But self preservation is, most, powerful instinct. people know reality, even refuse acknowledge others.

Why assume people getting together friends Covid denier?

Maybe they’re like me? know virus real, understand they’re really, really low risk anything bad flu ... they’re willing weigh risk live lives.

So don’t wear mask don’t want to. Immunity long lasting repeat customers rare. You’ve seen information that’s information coming developers, whether requirement irrelevant, that’s vaccine works. vaccines may come future able prevent spread, not. believe it’s dangerous spread idea you’re vaccinated can’t catch spread virus, will, higher likelihood asymptomatic like everyone around vaccinated. people believe somehow immune dangerous still affected. It’s important people understand now, rather thinking virus later. vaccine may come prevent infection spread, humble opinion not, ones aren’t it. we’re concerned can’t vaccinate, that’s crucial information. Right concern preventing death, done vaccines. ones I've personally worked for, 11 12.

I've seeing lot websites people link here. hate crass - pretty shitty family hold financial well-being pressure intending silly family celebrations global pandemic.

I don’t know situation I’d consider reevaluating relationship longer financially dependent they’ve shown true colors time. wised now, much information need? see reason people would changed mind Christmas. Let's hope I'm dead wrong whit that. probably least worries, yeah, wish best - great songs. don’t understand subreddit allowing politics, especially randomly divisive broad comments meant divide stereotype entire groups? Marked moderation. fascinating, thanks sharing Amazing almost political victims R next names. seems unfathomable me. many hospitals SCC :( reported England hospitalisations severe cases people given vaccine.

A brief summary BBC states 20,000 people involved trials, 30 received jab contracted virus 101 received dummy jab contracted virus.

Can someone explain meaningful data draw conclusion? know things work vaccines surely science behind must analysis 30 people?

How possibly said reasonable certainty vaccine prevents serious illness 30 people contracted virus given jab? And, given 20,000 people involved trials reasonable assume 1 3 ratio infections representative sample?

I always hopeless science completely uninterested, maybe someone help looking untutored eye, confidence making statements based number people involved trials. Here's quick math... said 131 COVID19 cases across whole trial. 90% dosing regiment quarter participants, let's assume quarter cases, 33. 

90% effective means would 30 cases placebo arm 3 vaccine arm. (The math use based assumption amount people vaccine arm gotten COVID19 number people got placebo arm. 27 ""protected"" -- 27/30 = 90%). incidence rate low, there's lot uncertainty. Maybe 15 people vaccine arm ""should"" gotten it; case 12/15 80%. 

Basically, even though numbers seem large, low incidence rate means there's still fair deal uncertainty around true efficacy. cheaper store transport produce.
This brilliant news model shows Covid ICU patients doubling 10 days. Although we're already full, guess can't happen.

Very first comment see sub. Yikes :( churches insist events Oklahoma... happens.

Hope happy, evil mofos. know else cause rise poverty, homelessness, unnecessary deaths? climate crisis mass displacement follows it. really point arguing “climate change happened before!!” reason neglect it, shows done basic scientific research topic. There’s major difference natural fluctuations chemically/physically altering state planet manmade means interferes natural balance planet self-destructive extent. 

Also interesting you’re using “unnecessary deaths” defense America’s absolute apathy regarding climate change economic success dependent incessant warfare strong arming countries since ww2. Yup. We're going hearing lot stories relatives die TG/XMAS/NYE/NY/SB parties.  though hard determine exact cause get from, would love see statistics this. would expect 90% hospital would want evidence support it. Ya, skimming abstract, samples lung cancer screening study. even misidentified ""Pneumonia"" patients. Although used ""proprietary"" serum test. think needs peer review conclusions made. Hey mods! I’d like dispute incivility comment. There's overstating that. There's grim reality coming people really can't even imagine now. (Or ignore it. feel like crying desert.) There’s old saying among consistently fucked VA, “the VA made vets could get screwed country again”. important thing misses (1) going blend vaccines 70-90% effectiveness west, 70% upper bound (2) single severe case reported vaccine cohort AZD, way better Pfizer Moderna. even country vaccinated vulnerable populations 'only' 70% protective vaccine, hospitals relatively empty, essentially reduces virus flu-like condition merit strong border controls apart maybe cheap rapid test borders infectious patients. Agree completely eradicate COVID-19 way would blunted dramatically way think flu. Eradication never realistic long-term aim anyway imo. 12 million still immunity time vaccine out. lot likely immune anymore infected August. ebt rep LA. not. daughter exposed California Highway Patrol officer tested positive. point go gatherings then. It’s range 62-90 depending amount dosage given, average 70% 4d 2,000 year chess game.... Fully agree. non scientific destroying lifeline businesses have. think things somehow shield human behavior motivation drives people protect others. Much cheaper, stable transport specific regimen give protection little lower two? sounds like great addition vaccination effort, especially countries less extensive cold storage. Fantastic news amazing speed researchers. read earlier snow birds coming Florida right now. Jesus christ. no, least much; we’re still talking sample thousands. odd. aye; virus knew would happen prior full access vaccine.

it's many folk wanted full body student nurses doctors switched from.education internship style learning beginning.

it's late that.

Hope there’s people like time Given user name, guess could make better use one many makeshift morgues? people said making vaccine would impossible reacting us batting 3-for-3 far vaccines late stage data in? everythings god's will...... thenwhat difference anything....  Yup. helps think backwards, go reverse halves every day. 
 
But here's trick viruses: example one lily becomes 2, 2 become 4, 4 become 8 on. viruses, one 'Lily' become 3, 4,5... however many people someone infect. speeds process even more.  Getting outside walk talk great! Powerful. someone America know Covid now, oh god doing. schoolmate reported days ago CHP officer? children 11 get exposed CHP officer Gavin wife? timing seems right public dinner had. restaurants increased sales May restaurants closed lowering number competitors.  weird. reported right read this, sky news 07.42 90% effective.

What fuck? Company making rapid progress manufacturing capacity 3 billion doses vaccine 2021 rolling basis, pending regulatory approval.   vaccine stored, transported handled normal refrigerated conditions (2-8 degrees Celsius/ 36-46 degrees Fahrenheit) least six months administered within existing healthcare settings.  Thats regiment dependant. regiment showing 64% Africa unaffected? common sense would lead believe covid devastate African nations. . Based Phase IIs, I'm quite certain J&amp;J Novavax similar results Oxford - 70-90% protection depending dosing regimen (they mRNA vaccines either). We're going number choices Feb-Mar require freezer temperatures. promising.  but, asians aren’t susceptible island nations (but don’t talk UK) lucky it’s shut proper quarantine welfare measures protect people!! It’s totally normal 2000 day die country disease stopped staying inside wearing mask! Ah Texan way. Makes wonder people take chance finally get rid someone revenge, without ever prosecuted passive-aggressive act sharing fine meal (at expense turkey populace US).

Most people Danny DeVito, 'Throw Momma Train'. healthy, go mask-less two weeks, inhale deeply store visit 'ole granny, hug old bat 'heart-felt', dark 'I love you!' watch unfold.

Not give anyone ideas. might even consciously kill way. yes obviously exaggerating, referring ""no normal 2022 crowd"" routinely ignore evidence rich countries, especially developed vaccine, reaching point much sooner understood Think children watching adults act like make decisions like this. Either become way violently backlash like wild empathy. only. never question. Stimulus checks used multiple times, include 2008 recession.

It literally whole point, even name... Yeah. neuro told I'm like... uh?!?

I think trying calm Dad worried home but, buying it. Seems like papers presenting evidence steady IGG following healthcare workers, might best sample regularly re-exposed. Oof :(

I admit sure nuked fragile plans actually go try making friends area California in, don’t mind asking? new normal immense mistrust broken relationships across nation.

The virus? Hopefully we'll figure out. good.
The best ever tasted Muchen, good old days could drive around half europe. 0% chance I’m taking new vaccine first.

What say makes sense. luck 40,000 (or many depending counting) already took problem! many many even given chance take it, probably millions! think thats whole point. Decisions public health based people translocate minimizes effectiveness said decisions. 

Ergo frustration necessity counties taking charge, instead different approach. majority recent popular posts thread one, damn sad getting absurd? incredible pain threshold.  Exactly. 

And suffer “mild” infections? Especially 20 40-something crowd? Yeah. “long haulers” they’re dubbed. wouldn’t want one rolls dice thinks they’ll get mild infection lingering effects. It’s best option. Broad quarantines aren’t working.

It’s UK that’s deploying fast, frequent testing part quarintines don’t hold. fully expect quarantining compliance worse U.S. Thank you. surprises though.

Further - major problem way people seem come understand range potential responses pandemic neglect acknowledge political socio-cultural contexts. quite different policy set available UK available many US environments. Sounds similar experience, though little fatigue five months out. find little fishy utterly incapable critical thought majority Americans seem be? Well, I've always knee pain. interim doctor, would take look? pay businesses lost income $aud750/wk employees lay off, minimal paperwork initially.

It's [dropped recent times due general stingyness, honestly can't imagine small businesses could survived without it. biases speaking assume America similar, worse execution benefits big businesses. it. boundary defending. TL;DR Kick one Republicans voluntarily got virus. Truer words dude. sound like you’re 12 concept responsible drug use. holy mother covid, art within us, hallowed spread bane. done, Europe, Texas. Give us day daily deaths, deliver us unto ventilators, deliver ventilated morque. contagion, time greed, economy grinds on, spiritus sancti, Achoo. Three five us pharmacists nurses thing really blows mind it.

My grandmother sisters nurses otherwise involved medical industry (X-Ray tech), wife's grandmother, anti-vacc ex-girlfriend.

Not single ""ignorant nurse"" story surprises me. That's something someone then. bill defines first responders are. moments exactly like this. low quality content, even sub... automod must alseep behalf us Americans actually taking seriously, humbly apologize rest world ignorance masses this.....plauge ridden country... assure like people refuse wear mask take virus seriously. 

My heart goes people lost someone covid. I've seen many family's lose loved ones this, almost lost one own. 

To struggling dire time. Please strong hang there. know put much stress many people, pass. virus halt us forever. Keep guidlines given cdc, beat this.

You strong people. Keep hopes up, anyone needs someone talk to, ear open.

Be safe everyone. people keep rainy day funds, good Somehow don’t really feel bad. There’s simple rule people can’t follow don’t adhere it. didn’t go. don’t understand. mom isolates us works hospital. dad lives cause accepted risk. live one person barely go out. stay home shit. don’t understand it’s hard gather fun. something yourself. google it, understanding side effects minor, normal vaccinations. far, FDA fine it, even large scale deployment.

Fortunately us, FDA kind stuff long time.

And fortunately, 70,000 people US (and many elsewhere) took small risk worry it. standard procedure many disability claims, state aid claims numerous places. 

Take IL aid example; may changed Covid, years ago order someone get food stamps, assigned meeting time state. person make meeting, paperwork said ""call ___ number."" 

That number unreachable outside line. 

If missed meeting, they'd get sent paperwork stating ""you've automatically declined. may legally appeal wish."" though could afford attorney need food stamps. 

Nobody tells people reapply unless cakes say they're recording call use rather firm tones voice. Well, always wanted practice medicine. Time loosen regulations. Yet got elected. That's frustrates whole thing. Bolsonaro, Trump, Putin, many others past... bad country, yet get elected. Ah man sucks.  I'm guessing Texas prison guards included. hope right, seems like lot people - including dying - still denial. well said. [Narrator] would prove mistake. Hopefully good things look forward coming year... sure much hope year. whole thing made sort things painfully clear.

""Good luck own"" ""It's fault prosperous"" seem like values embracing.. Yet we've somehow got there. Bryce lost 12 points 2018 generally good year Democrats. average iq america going steadily. even. inject mRNA gets translated viral proteins ....its bs point.

It's bull shit every single time uttered. society incredibly divided matters principle, simply possible way us anything together.  Well that's dumb. definitions first responder individual states? Spent avocado toast mean, I’m sure UK much functioning government... true asymptomatic person little chance spreading. Large chance spreading. variant much transmissable, reasons yet known. lethal. 
But yes, correct, fairly high survival rate overall. frozen bodies ... quite chilling

Let's round applause tonight's open mic performers, folks.  Thanksgiving sucks. Turkey bland boring. Hardly worth dyng over. here. husband high risk (we take immune system suppressing medications) many friends family members taken attitude ""It's bummer guys self-isolate protect yourselves, we'll see whenever safe come again"" heard since. asked. offense two people came September, seemed random (and apparently is). everything, possible, makeup virus unlikely mutate rapidly enough problem vaccines. opinion piece posing unlikely results? Pathetic. believe hard data, emotions. still going in-person classes social events March shutdowns, graduate college less month get enough work done, can't drive, may well damn disabled work anything freelance writing *maybe* remote position, see life changing much get COVID shots, either. :( China lucky Xi dictator life! 

It’s shame highly educated technocrats couldn’t crack conditions led worldwide pandemic caused many suffer  Unfortunately next week night fighting caseload instead lying bed worrying it.

And week that, week that, community starts taking seriously.  seem like FEMA prison guards either really. theses Federal definition first responders grants security guards prison guards seem included them. We're unreasonable; mean, one's gonna eat eyes. No, UVC kills virus shield earth atmosphere. Uh okay? Yes, pushing through. Wish everyone could see 60+ hour work weeks feel like. grateful keep helping others can’t much longer without breaks fucks sake. since America bail anyone isn’t “too big fail” ?

Exactly. That’s fucking problem. 

And yes agree monetary issue secondary health safety issue, point monetary issue cannot ignored like past 6 months. I'd consider security guard first responder check laws. “It’s easy don’t allow anyone in! Indeed, sympathies situation. 
Ensuring jumping frying pan fire wise. thing they’re tons industries survive restaurants open. still contagious you’ve vaccinated get virus? quickly eradicate system? doesn’t make things better, it’s slight consolation, appear dipping terms test positivity percentage peaking 10% recently parking lot analysis ist bs. could reason. nature exponential growth would led growing numbers fast. virus wouldnt taken break septembrr december. security guards first responders too? I'm owed lot discounts college days. always dudes picking like small women, children, etc.

Fucking cowards.


Id knocked piece shit out. look way, itd stopping terrorist. guy attempting spread deadly contagious virus. people assaulted get sick died?

They need throw book piece shit make example him. stimulus cheques went earlier year? buy SPY calls? believe main reason churches wanted stay open 

Sunday donations people know extended family circle acquaintainces taking COVID least seriously ones *most* active family activities. family (and maybe church) matters them, nobody else does. guess I'd agree idea society atomized, I'd argue per-family (hence popularity cutting called “toxic” family members).

I suspect never actually toxic family member known anybody real life has. (And read internet, might unrealistic idea ""popular"" is.) Like multi-decade addict stole everybody family (and entire rest family also cut off), person refused decades get help increasingly-bad mental health issues. hardcore deniers / anti-maskers, point get take things seriously, literally lock rehab facility. brainwashing deep

Of course, never happen, likely way start experiencing enough personal tragedy **might** start questioning beliefs. emphasis ""might"", since we've seen COVID patients dying breaths still deny existence pandemic. feel sorry 3 attend got did.

My stepson's father might take big party. legal recourse gets us COVID. china, Russia India

lol

China least claims Russia India? Really dude? expert field vaccines medicine general?  monetary issue secondary health safety issue... since America bail anyone ""too big fail"" ? 7 days row though alternative broad quarantines already know won’t hold. people exposed, symptomatic. I'm it. ""1"" person would fall ill high risk elderly needs stay home let rest us live lives instead trying quarantine entire population. point we're ""saving"" lives. We're trading lives. happiness financial security traded away someone else's trade longer agree to. hell lot us left live over? fear Covid. fear insane life ruining regulations. protests nothing way vent pent anxiety lockdown replace year's lost music festivals. 

It could anything triggered them. Roll dice black guy died.  understand defentions are? Pollution ""capitalism"" thing. biggest polluters earth place like china, Russia India counties claim socialist nations. People wont even wear mask here! live fucked world don’t Almost every ""news"" happens Covid, applies many infections diseases flu (assuming similar severity symptoms). course try intense exercise sick, exclusive Covid! wonder many businesses make getting requirement way flu, exceptions medical... Americans first scream rigged numbers talking COVID stats other, successful countries That's I've thinking. Household transmission 10-40% range IIRC suggests normally highly contagious. maybe pandemic actually propelled primarily superspreader events, possible could circulate undetected national holiday (like Christmas) creates necessary conditions huge multiple superspreader incidents.

I also wonder superspreader events when, whatever reason, virus become airborne. Maybe function environment, spreader themselves... Next big news capacity opening overflow school, forms, previously closed hospitals. know someone experience. Running 3-4 miles 4 days week, got covid, run half mile two months shortness breath. Took 4-5 months get back still fatigue sometimes. get false negatives. Fewer get false negatives once. frequency testing that’s key: “effective screening depends largely frequency testing speed reporting, marginally improved high test sensitivity.” agree earlier point though, can’t expect people quarantine without financial support. I’ve read half comply.  

So think cost/benefit question is: quarantine lot people effectively regularly test far smaller number people? 

I’m U.S. ~a third us believe whatever makes us feel good quarantining question. I’m testing team. “more men die, women affected” need EBT call ask it. 

You mean Europe? Yeah, OK, thanks asking. Taxes used us, people. article April, since well established PCR tests detect inactive remnants virus RNA. Even time ""days"" known major overestimate realistic scenario..

Most recent guidance/research says, uncommon channel (not totally risk free, nothing world risk *possible* though reevaluated turns cold outside temperatures make virus likely survive surfaces would you. 200.000 cases day, fly US probably less risk infection ones already US. research shows safe! research air travel companies commissioned! aleady see people get flu shot, KILLED vaccine, swear got flu it. millions getting year odds people coincidently come flu around time get vaccine anything around 25 75% people flu asymptomatic get someone appear know infected.

it inevidible vaccines roll millions getting least people concidently start showing symptoms disorder body quiety probably reactions really coming vaccine. relative bad reactions several different vaccines vast majority without anything sore spot arm couple days &amp; talking Dr whether getting covid19 ones become avaiable.  Good point, different scenario. Vaccines take 10 - 15 years pass safety standards. lot vaccines probably lot quicker that. one get 7 billion people quickly possible. they’ve working less 1 year. I’m science welcome news vaccine understand people worried. No, examples *fucking capitalism*. vaccine ten years? False.

is denier talking point tho? seems like type thing sub saying march  fact even happens fucking outrageous. everything money. 

I’m saying shouldn’t imposing restrictions, continuing impose restrictions zero financial relief wrecking havoc American lives without contracting COVID-19. 

If federal government paying affected restrictions lockdowns that’s fine, cannot continue put millions Americans work pay dime. Seroprevalence studies shown much wider prevalence, e.g. seroprevalence across Karnataka 46.7% (95% CI: 43.3-50.0), including 44.1% (95% CI: 40.0-48.2) rural 53.8% (95% CI: 48.4-59.2) urban areas. proportion testing positive RT-PCR, ranged 1.5 7.7% rural areas 4.0 10.5% urban areas, suggesting rapidly growing epidemic.""  know get it, dry cough pretty weird (like flu-like) freaking persistent. fatigue hits like ton bricks. trust body. government completely failed us. think presumption 50-60% country going get infected 6 months shake out. We're even 5% nationwide yet, even generous handwave accounting people never went statistics. also discounts infections ultimately mean mutations, least might enable reinfections. seems likely without vaccine, pandemic would take least another year burn out, longer.  nothing money. uh, got proof fake? American education system failed us. know true is. I've read countless stories people covid positive working closely(like hair dresser) dozens people knew zero spread parties wore masks. Brazil get money buy vaccines? Eh people existential. Even I’m dropping existential dread this. worrying killing others good enough. Tbh it’s easy improve life point since haven’t really gone last months. money buy anything. stupid stimulus, can't work cause kids home. Rent huge impossible pay. hell able spend money???? country would immigrate to, could go anywhere? better life. curious.  order Schweinshaxe No, I’m Texas people don’t need reach brain one. still need dig pretty deep nostril though swab 10sec each. It’s best time year!

I don’t forget. need travel visit family, ""bubble."" Dont gotta remember deny killed ever happened first place. going apocalyptic Christmas. okay, need to. US market based system, price healthcare simply rise people decide get sick, socially distancing, forgoing thanksgiving/Christmas etc, high prices attract healthcare providers able cover left surge. failure, market provide market balance.

... think that's we're supposed believe, right? something goes wrong prison, guards first respond. Holy shit.... errr Good grief people. 
They called baby wipes.
Use put air-tight bag throw away.
One box 200 count go LONG way.
Leave TP ladies guys. 
Believe not, cleaner. Ok, that's fair point. sure, I'm fine people returning home reasons. long quarantine. I'm saying holiday travel happening though. Like stay put. things go smoothly, year since started getting bad. “We’re supposed help people.” 
“We’re supposed help *OUR* people, Bob! Starting stockholders! Who’s helping out, huh?!” Yup, surprising honestly. work furniture store, people special ordered June may waiting spring. considering surges virus everywhere, I’m hoping “non essential” manufacturing doesn’t get shut down.

P.S. arguing COs first responders, are, per definition first responder. true ailments right now, CoVID19 straining resources throughout Midwest.

Please stay safe. want stalk people reddit, make explicit. Noone know beefs otherwise. link evidence sunlight inactivates virus fact suggests UVC, component sunlight, inactivate it.

Sunlight definitely kills virus. question quickly, especially winter. know people depend low wage service jobs pay bills feed kids, right? it’s waiters cooks getting fucked this. It’s small business owners too. Maybe they’re rich enough give fuck about. 

No, jobs aren’t glamorous Silicon Valley 6 figure white collar cushy positions. they’re people got. Well even true, I’m sceptical of, still likely originated China, exactly transparent government! constitution needs overturned there's pandemic seems. much bigger something relatively trivial states rights. needed top approach federal government including distancing, masks, group restrictions later spring. 

We get it. this, going get worse. patients still play musical instruments ICU !RemindMe 4 weeks  actual blood hands dont shut them. 

People going actually die covid. live NJ lot restaurants arent even attempting safe indoor dining measures, pack full. idiots dining soon sit sit remove masks entire time.covid

Here's thing lot restaurants NJ. refuse adapt. websits, doordash, outdoor dining, food aint good enough beat competition delivery take out. Lockdowns merely hastened failures. going out.

Impossible need work outside house. point practically virus catched poor working class everywhere. Yep, case, sticking million people planes today really bad fucking idea given level spread right now. It’s absolutely indefensible. Two week quarantine (with even grocery trips) makes sound pretty safe me. 
But also kind unrealistic... hosts buy Thanksgiving groceries two weeks ago? everyone fill gas tanks two weeks ago? Etc.  
It still sounds fairly safe, limited community contact last two weeks. public servants, COs propagating prison industrial complex people feel least. 

Classic Texan ethos would say dont like exposed disease choosing work somewhere treats people subhuman, free find work elsewhere.

Pretty difficult feel sorry Texans, least modern overseers, chosen treated like time time again. recently seem like Greece quite well. ICUs full death rates 1/2 France Italy 1/4 Belgium Czech Republic's peaks? initial capacity low comparison? Nope. deserve burn hell. Denying valid insurance claims killing people money. 

Getting murdered mugging actually humane since much quicker. Texas

Telling workers families Togo pound stones


Name iconic duo Ditto Maybe I'll stay bubble NWT now.... assume like Australia caps number people allowed country overwhelm hotel quarantine system. Yet people traveling Oct 18. about? Sensational headline? Ok. never connected anyone thorough messenger,discord, twitch, youtube, Skype, zoom, reddit, facebook? inventing reasons seek help scared, rational. pretending covid get going stupid careless effects far you. 

We near end. Stop making excuses kill others yet actual healthcare worker gave firsthand account along sourced stats reject well. actually told nurse like double shifts overcrowded hospital staff literally dying viral load, quit. That's despicable. Absolutely inhuman. participating trial then?

Because AstraZeneca one requires covid positive well , I’m one get 100 per visit spend 80 shuttle people actually influencing lot young dumb people think okay party pandemic. started Instagram call @influencers_spreading_covid need know wrong  College four years long. Many people across country already school. Think little here. 

Stop blaming kids, blame colleges want.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* real person? Haha makes laugh people like exist. Carry almost there, almost... read articles ;) yo, know kind thing frustrating. people sub seriously need check holier-than-thou attitude. /r/coronavirus greatest example posturing virtue signaling I’ve seen site. too! tithing done online isn’t money. Exactly. ""Its almost completely harmless. It'll magically disappear. Plus we're rounding turn."" .... abyss hell! tragic, I’m terrified triage becomes thing. One thing slightly annoys feel like I’ve reading exact article 7 months now. get actual numbers projections this? feel like people becoming numb headlines never seem come true. realize point will, worry cynical people seeing “boy cried wolf” situation. discomfort smallest way help fellow human beings China, DRC Middle East. 

You discomfort stop man made global warming.

You care people. scared time ass person far away another country.

Now want compassion. want mercy.

You deserve it. Yo....a 400' python arms! current rate infection, well 150k day atm. Vaccine rollout starting january earliest general population. much population well get infected get vaccinated. imagine raging infections rate along vaccine finish pandemic quicker. imagine going reach point 250k+ infection vaccines roll out. guess? I’d rather alone Thanksgiving without loved one (or more) forever. Common sense, people, right? even good TV! Black Friday base model!! Contrary might think, purpose agencies *not* give people money. make process dealing difficult possible we've demonised idea government giving people money helping much basically treat anyone needs help support (even people legitimate claims) like they're lowest scum Earth disciples Satan deserve much kind word.

It's really disgusting. system actually helping people making hard possible get money might actually better society. affecting thinking

Mmhmm, there's anti-intellectualism playbook trope #13 right there: ""You longer agree bullshit, arguments it, clearly place people dangerous society. Change mind conform ostracized!""

Maybe take advice, hon. Here, I'll help you: #blocked Yea real shame. Chicago, they've shut everything again, part (except outdoor dining... pleasant experience November part world). think lockdown necessarily bad idea, given shit show virus causing, I'm round there's aid. Many lucky enough able work home, bar restaurant owners? They're screwed. Many classic, old, beloved establishments already shut doors.

As Aussie, there's reason know this, state Illinois (Chicago's state) exactly financially well off, governor basically stuck either sacrifice local economy risk overloading hospitals. feds, led stupid orange piece shit, declared pandemic taken care sometime July. really wish we'd take page Melbourne's book, hands kind tied. I'm round lockdowns, would could properly manage financially. can't.

Rant over. yea living pseudo-developed country kind sucks sometimes. Dude, fucking beer belly, double chin, NASCAR loving mother fucker; he’s stereotype it’s pathetic. ever liked kid, adult relationship man.

The relief get seeing knowing dad less moronic kid. LOL That’s wrong. People asymptomatic means “easily spread” virus. It’s symptoms cause spread, coughing, sneezing, excess mucus saliva expelled body. chances people contracting virus someone asymptomatic drastically lower unlikely happen unless close contact person extended amounts time, like spouse family member. thought pretty self explanatory stuff fear mongering sub hand Username checks out. governor everything keep Florida top covid infection rate list,

But Florida top list. getting panties bunch? really really questionable tbh. get wrong, really want Christmas year, close economy 3 months start March start again. Cleaner, stronger, wiser.

We're cycling loops hoping every time cycle, virus goes away something changes.

No widespread availability proven vaccine = rising deaths. Gyms absolutely worst place go thing gone. too, everything overpriced like crazy. find identical stuff stores half price. Post weight. $1200 month since first one. worried mortgage crisis! Denmark decided start bat farms order produce bat fur coats instead. cause concern? first weekend opened months already announced shutting back voluntarily. even read article? plenty space people grouped together. happens underpay people, force work toxic environments, treat like expandable. would anyone right mind want RN? friends engineers. Save level school (bachelor's degree) treated like GOLD. bosses treat utmost respect. RN friends get treated like shit. admins talk like working requires training. replaced like cashier Walmart. 

The pay also worth it. know area starting pay RNs amount 10 years ago. 

Hospitals also miserable places work at. something hospitals turn 55-year old adults messy,gossipy middle schoolers. outdoor dining, basically dining again,large portions prototype became current front-runners. way vaccines worse covid. Sometimes given good choice I'm hoping deny second time. Insurance companies shady undignified live South Florida. Governor idiot. senators. open wants. partake foolishness. Protect myself. Limit contact people outside pod. Ik agree I’m talking abt title CDC also need remind ""those people' eat laundry pods put fingers electric outlets?   future reference one sign this? Honestly, sounds like took seriously most, thought could get away one special occasion. I'm advocating it, snide remark really fitting.   dont know say curbed Seoul yet hopefully numbers go soon time well. said annoying see coworkers properly wearing masks work numbers high like this. it’s specific LA dining. would be? Covid global problem must long lost cousin

But seriously, went wedding August (yeah, know) ended reading 4 books week every night preferred read alone engage whatever brain eating conversation extended family around fire. bunch alcoholic morons watch Fox News read books. I’m you! Stay safe comrade! guess somethings aren’t bigger there? definitely sister. open inviting lunch near house (which always turned down) won’t invite house it’s one bedroom apartment shares BF. keep home. won’t go peoples homes either. Believe scholarships exist. Plenty people school scholarships. 

Why insist bitter? someone get college? That’s enough, please stop. ""We experiencing catastrophic turbulence shortly hereafter, hope enjoyed flight."" Huh, lint belly button I’ve seen different set ups. ones insane ones 4 sides closed door flap opening. Makes absolutely zero sense give anyone goes crazy side eyes delusional substantially safer eating indoors. I’ve seen tent top, though, sides open. it’s bunch big dining umbrellas overhead. don’t really bother me. see country nuke entire industry (Denmark #1 mink producer world) officials order dig dead bodies burn concern get groundwater infect people - pay attention. It’s like Wuhan literally welded people houses stop spread. understand fully took drastic measures stop still could. said thought wouldn’t get together WOULD WEAR MASKS okay read? This, feel this. get treated like constantly starting really get me. live AZ this. Outside dinner exception going bathroom, masks outside aren’t eating. Whats even worse personal stun bunnies, aka Canadian Snowbirds, flying south winter. Naturally, mixing among fools, getting nice infected, likely try fly home 'our medicare' instead paying US version. lie, try board, infect every passenger. may return spring super spreaders like Heir Trump, Lord Lies, Duke Denial, Knight Naught.

Florida needs grow pair go draconian them.  problem isn’t whether want stay home. want stay home, wife wants stay hoke, best friend wants stay home can’t people like won’t stay home. work we’re essential workers hear lot stories people “weighted risk” weighed wrong. kid lost parents cause weight wrong. families duct taping crosses outside hospital windows. nurses quitting. Every day go work clench jaw tight I’m scared getting people like “live lives.” 

So yes denier. might think risk real disease real actions don’t take account people risk lives “live yours” really what’s fucking difference know it’s real act like it’s not. Back toiling away office 9 hours day...Thankful job know I'm well but...fuck. u see raft 300 people come ashore know Broke college kids attending school halfway across country. Sure. Money lives. Makes sense fucked.

What college accepting folks brain dead enough fly pandemic. Well time head woods get one. They'll fine! /s never opened Last time Mass incense, left soon priest came (I’d asked told particular Christmas Mass incense free) still ended ER, month prednisone afterwards. I’d totally healthy prior walking in.

I would happy all. Millennials 40 I'm democrat I've always found creepy. One friends crush I'm really confused response. really curious marriage like Jr's current gf tho... cancelled Lunar New Year holiday (Their equivalent Thanksgiving/Christmas) last minute Like 4? Nothing worry about, I'm sure flu. Stats even offered, let alone required, much US country sucks disabled. treat chronically ill like shit.  Sorry bearer bad news. :( good help government increased unemployment benefits. government give 1200 6 months ago say fuck said contagious. also lots traffic laws. 1/4 million Americans dead this. hate American people much? Welcome rest world Exactly. People catch real quick. /s  It’s gonna interesting see happens, say least. longer upset it. expect it. Seems like badge honor make harder rest us. 

I’m RN taking care Covid patients. I’m also gonna keep working extra shifts cover nurses symptomatic Covid work. It’s getting exhausting. 

People free whatever hell want. Hope works them. Hope there’s enough healthcare workers keep suiting showing up. didn’t think anything would happen something happened guess shouldn’t done that. Well might reconsider going there. Nah dude, it’s US. Y’all fucked.

Here Canada lifted pickup trucks rednecks getting putting skull themed mask. complaints, fuss. 

Occasionally you’ll see dick nose that’s it. everyone giving everyone space. complain locked down. masks purel norm everywhere. drink mean there's still takeout, delivery, drive thrus open. live Long Beach southernmost part LA county lot wonderful family owned restaurants neighborhood plan support eating around twice week (and cooking rest meals home) leave big tips help get tough time. Hopefully get stimulus directed food service industry. I'm pretty sure news China HARD locking cities came like year ago. What, y'all think fun? losing many good nurses this. work, pressure administrators, deaths make almost impossible continue. Someone needs address issue. toll takes, nurses need time usual. problem coming soon shortage hospital beds, shortage nurses. People go hospital, one take care them. pretty. Covid patients dying dehydration infections Covid takes them. People responding comments. discussion? Calling people names don’t want hear answer incredibly immature. upsets you, ignore move on. It’s also like Covid going permanent thing either. personally love Thanksgiving really wanted spend family year I’m canceling Covid. Given news vaccine lot hope big Thanksgiving next year I’d rather miss one holiday kill someone’s grandmother. It’s “living fear” temporarily cancelling plans. could save 99.9% people. Oh. Wait

The link cdc screengrab jerk you’re responding made correct assertion it’s unlikely, let explain further. mutation rate SARS-CoV-2 considered fairly slow. article state key genetic region codes spike protein appears fairly stable. may likely render vaccine useless, isn’t outside realm possibility, albeit fairly small one. far vaccine research virus primarily targeted spike protein. definitely ways make work. friend early Thanksgiving parents (to avoid week of) roommate bubble ate outside, parents ate inside, glass sliding doors them. side brought food. seemed pretty safe compromise, family members refused come. insisted wanted ""real"" Thanksgiving, Covid thing. mean, yeahhh...don't all? jfc let's little less selfish figure ways still make work. How? Oh I’m sorry dude. didn’t mean last comment misinterpreted. absolutely think you’re “one people.” Now, made comment, hang two covid friends play Russian roulette covid Petri dish apartment think keeping safe. you’re fun size version covid dummy doesn’t mean you’re still covid dummy. least people know theyre putting risk, think long wear mask hang buddy that’s feeling sick. 

Lol hope cleared up. fact you’re heated shows know you’re wrong. stay home, call two buddies Skype zoom whatever stop risking life fucking apartment hang odds good [a lot doesn’t seem uhm... helpful aware death rate? whole family over. Can't live fear. Everyone knows could possible get/give can't miss out, guaranteed tomorrow anyway.  want sweet sweet tuition money lol They're trying go Japan route. Except UK Japan. kind pandemic special bunch celebrities people feel alone Thanksgiving day. Would give something look forward see celebrities also alone household.


Except would extremely functional, government Would like hook inside tied around hips?  Yea I'm sure we'll issues that. But, enough continue drag pandemic another year? likely. good positive give up, also cruel pretend OP tough situation. affect everyone equally. people need Jesus Chancla! patient ask take - told absolutely read safety data it... assuming proper protocols followed, 100% recommend line it. pandemic needs end. America. They're likely send us bill check. Incorrect... nutrients must delivered intravenously. try police officer? Exactly. good partnership, side provided something side couldn't. wages. healthcare. jobs. apologise indolence. nah made bed refused wear masks yell nurses trying treat them. let lay it. im tired letting idiots face consequence's actions. Get out. Go park corner away everyone work even hour day. start that. agree 100% America giving first repsponders healthcare, name less iconic duo think really believe virus hoax. easier say covid hoax say okay people dying hurt bottom line 401Ks. People accustomed telling convenient lies.

I think cruise ship packages same. think people weigh risks rewards, decide cheap cruise worth risk. Also, people appear smart appear poor impulse control. think factors real actually believing virus hoax. Maximum suffering = minimum expenditure. it?

No. Assuming they're lying, wearing masks washing hands day square notion think big deal. initial remark makes sound like putting level anti-maskers people think hoax/fake. people know live  *you* caught virus *you* one died, I'd fine that. Seriously, could care less people purposely make sick die sickness. problem *I* forced go work come contact someone like you, *I* get sick even though wear mask correctly consistently, go except work supermarket.

How people *still* fucking understanding simple point?? got worst, low-effort trolls good point? Yes, thank you.  ...and still are. Actually, anecdotes type data. one 20 something...out millions...gets infected used cautionary tale? could walk outside get hit bus. odds would still same. Snap outta dude. sound like scared shadow. Yea, we'll see. definitely expect lot people refusing first unless there's mandate. I’m trying save planet I’m trying reduce effects ongoing pandemic. retarded illiterate? understood point grander scale humanity selfish inherently, it’s excuse take easy precaution current issue. argument like saying humans selfish shouldn’t drive car sidewalk? shouldn’t take shit buffet food to? it’s big issue that’s easy avoid simple efforts. I’m trying solve global hunger climate change. Jesus y’all dense. people put flu vaccine various reasons, putting risk. Cash incentive would motivate people delaying.

Don't worry convincing anti-vaxxers others margins, they're unreasonable. really excited over, worry whose fault go forward, much better seeing hundreds thousands deaths day. Maybe read one comment Broward County....what shit hole.  possibility get power. speaking president put safety Americans whats pocketbook. 70k hospitalized couple days ago. 14k us bad shape. 

A days thanksgiving us dying per day modern wars. heartbreaking. pork knuckles. 

pass. second time. third time three years getting court date attorneys work I'll considering different exit methods. least Washington state worked able seen doctors get treatment. literally every single aspect life shut going week two forced cold turkey medications.

The fact treating state workers like cold surprising. needs bar set low treat humans Texas. Yeah must buzzkill someone offers pay trip. hooker, done dumb shit money. 

Maybe work personality people offer pay visit too. Hell, he’s good enough dude, he’d probably fly party teach human interaction works. born/raised Florida Man ready anything. working number hours permitted visa - thats lied. process trying get visa extended - expires December. Thats going happen - sent home instead. think estimates around 70-80%, ""kick in"", infections gradually slow there's less less available hosts. also might work grocery store someplace multiple low grade exposures worried, get groceries delivered house. never leave. 

If person scared go work, go. Plenty people sitting around home collecting unemployment despite opportunities work. 

You also likely get walking someone passing. even less likely get surfaces. Contraction virus comes sitting speaking close proximity infected person ten minutes. Wearing masks, outdoors reduce risk dramatically. 

If someone spend time high risk demographic, take increased precautions. doubt. nobody right limit rights low risk people protect high risk people. get take rights make feel safer. 

Also, meant affects, effects Yes, many quitting totally exhausted hospitals stretched limit. better hope someone duty get sick need EMT, doctor, nurse ... course, Covid showed kind people shitty part modern society. find mask wearing form ""shopping cart"" theory applied global scale. bunch degenerate selfish scared losers lol. hell yes.

only nobody getting shot wearing mask....yet. Literally first result Google. ya go. Good luck, Father Time undefeated. interestingly, referring BLM protests, *very* highly masked, epidemiologists found significant virus outbreaks lined timeline location even massive BLM protests. observed many events city (I work downtown neighborhood), I'll damned things probably 95% masked higher. proof alone effective masking preventing viral spread.

No one believe me. look yourself. Google ""BLM protests virus outbreaks."" Looking states past year stumbles imagine amount next 6 months literally told comments I’m “one people” reason serious outbreak today. dumbest shit I’ve ever read. guilt tripping someone spending time two people fucking idiots partying bars masks shit like saying it’s people like we’re hitting 200,000 cases day I’m going call stupid. tip tiny, beat hat! Faux fine yes I'll bet look like million dollars thing. without feel guilty either, what's like? :) think point remain friends. Ok. Fair enough. Enjoy upvote tweet missing it’s minimum three weeks starting... three days now.

Why start they’re serious it? dont like birthdays either, nice family least person rather internet. county county shit misses fact everyone comes counties case this. expect tourists San Luis Obispo county make restrictions Los Angeles/Fresno etc make here. ouTsidE pOd....lol....who actually talks like that? Dork. believed virus fake, hoax, political gambit, overblown Fake News Media basically flu hyped up, would take vaccine? 

This type person probably get flu shot either. would let government inject something arm probably side effects making feel sick?

I eagerly waiting turn get vaccine, I've already gotten flu shot, I'm believer science medicine, vote group usually also does.

I see anyone small towns everyone thinks stupid fake virus going want vaccine something that's ""not even big deal."" would proof they're ""scared virus."" l irrational need appear *not afraid* discouraged peer group. get vaccine, LIE friends neighbors rather admit possibly fooled libbrl media hoax.

These areas going continue outbreaks, especially fall comes 2021 ::shocked pikachu:: there's another outbreak church. 

I'm going avoid areas several years. going continue disease reservoirs comply literally anything. messaging 14 days [**2020-12-07 01:48:18 UTC**](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2020-12-07%2001:48:18%20UTC%20To%20Local%20Time) remind [**this send PM also reminded reduce spam.

Needed food stamps getting fired without previous incident 10 years ago. 30 year old single white dude asking food stamps looked on. Yeah everyone knows 1000 dollar checks gonna implanted bill gates trackers, straight government three letter group waiting take guns, know come take them, spending dollars. Also checks specially vaccine spread touch turn liberal. LOL -3 downvotes reason? Redditors strange honestly, here’s upvote speaking truth  neighbor wife got Covid past week ""friendsgiving"" gathering adults. 12 people got/had there.  went back home kids rest fam spread further. Luckily pretty responsible staying home.

His father (whom I've known shoot breeze often) dropping groceries front porch struck conversation... 

Him- ""Don't think little suspicious suddenly huge rise cases? mean everyone wearing masks big numbers.  seems fishy""

Me- (dumbfounded) ""Well community spread linked private social gatherings people distancing wearing masks. know people walmart wearing masks shopping food make dinner bunch friends kind like really wearing masks counts""

Him- Maybe, still seems fishy me. edgy! yes, nurse doesn’t want job he/she hired for, absolutely quit. isn’t prison. Thousands people packed stands, yelling, cheering, shouting, therefore *spitting* air seems like legitimate problem pandemic. also sneaking suspicion virus-deniers less likely get tested make numbers ""look better."" fair, even CDC even suggests traveling way stops people rise up,"" Atlas said. ""You get accept.


And Dr Atlas trying stop Covfêfé-19, nope wants people rise local governments trying stop spread Covfêfé-19


Apparently 1600 Pennsylvania Ave full people hate democracy citizens. Haha right? vast majority Americans covid fatigue really care much people forum. bunch nerds guys are. still everything ""right"" still get infected. I'm done trying adhere rules made can't even follow. point lives sure....

Hope gets better. Wearing mask, Floridians, cause secession. Blows mind selfish pricks can’t make minor concession betterment fellow man global pandemic. threats consequences... Don’t believe everything read Reddit, either. life...

Let’s get carried away... exact danger going on. Rapids reliable, get PCR exposed family also need tested. happy ""judgement"", warranted. seems way United States. 9/11 responders, Veterans... Disgusting. Drive thru dude. I’m heading one right matter fact. Yeah definitely isn’t. Lol I’m glad we’re finally page. See? don’t fight! agree! know ""some people care get COVID long bed next them?"". people love food stamps, long getting too. aunt came MD AZ. stayed friend family went stay mom stepdad house they're going Thanksgiving aunt's house Thanksgiving. aunt could end spreader. told mom said want rude, see sister. said sister need fly Thanksgiving could end infecting everyone there. feeling one end Covid. told thanks thanks. /r/copypasta One hundred percent apparently people like wearing skin better know mean. Wisconsin here, Tavern League calls shots. weekend Widow’s Weekend, men hunting flood north bars women flood towns. next couple weeks going awful us. Right, definitely wasn’t lowered risk catching Yeah don’t many friends even less close ones I’m grateful ones have. Living Japan, still hear colleagues go indoor lunch events drinking parties.

As much harms people see (Japanese typically Judgemental), say ""fuck image right thing contributing recent growing spread"". Holiday movie - that’s great idea! sharing! wear godamn mask. gonna praise CDC guidance, masks protect wearers insurance himself, added we're married. also insurance home country, convert international insurance use America till his/get own. Well that's parents kick getting married someone dislike lol. Really tired hearing guy droning on.

We get it.

We're horrible, need shots. got it. 

And 'got it' first 100 times said Fauci.

Just get us vaccine already... Nah dont know. believe hearts ~~min...~~ lazies theives society ruining America.

And thats good enough vote on. would first responder Texas? Lol good god. Bad wages, respect, horrible benefits. seen SNL skit yet, think enjoying first thing think looking groceries. saw 4 night carribean cruise $400 room. me, anyway. like Trump blaming COVID Europe funniest thing I've heard quite while. Take state. like they're lowest scum Earth

its enough they're struggling, verge homelessness worse. must degraded whole way through. evil. C’mon man. Common sense answer great, considering rate infections Sweden increasing. Hopefully Sweden move away industry like Denmark Netherlands have. takes one. Texas particular.  Thats good analogy would affect neighbours. That's legit boat I'm in. one travelers. supposed do? homeless University allowed back campus January? 160 rest sounds uncomfortable letting contagious diseases spread among prison population cruel regardless did. already society. think agreeing. think people care get virus likely end asymptomatic mild symptoms. fuck wrong world.  Hope strategy. It’s time elected officials offer monetary plan individuals impacted mandatory killing individuals’ incomes. much now? feel awful nurses support staff. Doctors tired too, support folks work caring patients, I'm sure tired, especially confronted patients think virus that's ravaging body hoax. 

When hospitals overtaxed, likely numbers keep rising, nurses quit save mental health, blame them. Aus too, fatter (as country) memory - decent standard nationalised healthcare. Hey, that's like health insurance! No, dumb unlucky. would call dumb lucky conversation never end. 

So I’ll say everyone decide risk factor is. 3 friends tiny apartment 3 hours. far that’s okay. hope continues okay get prove wrong. already visa, got 10 year one 2014 like 5 years left it. 
And yeap I've thinking different options, however can't apply disability till citizenship right? 
He's still working his, system taking extremely long family he's going go route getting via degree (he bachelor's). I'll wait till that's sorted apply green card via spousal route. disability that. 
But fact things need cheaper great help me. 
My fiancè also insurance think I'll eligible use till get mine. insurance country birth, plan keep buying meds till insurance citizenship sorted out. (Shipping meds cost much).

Okay lot us college students forced campus go online break. else supposed go? lack concerted effort world’s two largest economies cost both

Back earlier part 2020 China dealing covid, America affected yet, American attitude covid would excellent opportunity take advantage China. instance, US government saw covid opportunity attract businesses China America create jobs. America dealing covid, American academics suddenly come idea China America work together deal covid. Awfully convenient, it? understand black white thinking going on. There's lot people besides ""huge gatherings"" ""absolute loneliness"". many cases sure beats family getting severely ill covid. something address cause problem rather addressing symptom problem? Idiots.

Morgue overflow symptom problem, problem addressed national guard. first result, LITERALLY first Well that’s insane yet happily fight peaceful blm protesters Ok feel like policies go beyond simply consideration demand conformity... example social credit score china prevents getting jobs low *Too much guilt apologies fact, enough preventative action fact. I’m sick it. almost empathy people feeling bad stupid.* Thanks invite, mate! think I'm gonna see happens summer big fat massive forest fire season first. baked said added nothing conversation There's evidence study. 2000 people dieing every day last week. think probably give businesses time prepare. person that’s idiot, yes should’ve easy take seriously. problem there’s lot idiots. Thanks, part feels awful taking they'll get it. family anti flu shot/future covid shot thinks hoax. Unfortunately, best mental health take break point.  'Murrikah!  could watch US election like that, sad watch Popcorn. people partying spreading covid year unlucky suppose. haha thing  Side question - people call stimulus? Isn’t welfare check? Stimulus economy, people buy groceries. It’s really incredible Operation Warp Speed pulled here. Less year first infection states first inoculation vaccine. Congrats made Operation Warp Speed success. News permitted 

You work confirmation bias. Unfortunately stuff politicized. parties absolutely dangerous, even outdoors. Masks much close together. people wearing masks those. thought pretty much shelved vaccine project completed. I'm aware. thirty anything stay shape, 45 do, thankfully I'm able. message clearly lost leaders. People deciding don’t care going socialize anyway.  Get it? People know risks. gone 9 months. Everyone knows. Honestly zero could probably bone Rushed vaccine gets approved Asia/Latin America/Africa: Furious redditors yelling developing country governments insulting entire nationalities people

Rushed vaccine gets approved Europe/USA: Redditors cheering happy must mean something people hoarding toilet paper bottled water again.  see would controversial either side. Republicans love pro-veteran aspect, democrats love giving healthcare millions, *fucking everyone* love saving money. Sort of. states hospitals ask state regulatory agencies initiate ""crisis care rules"" something similarly named legally allows choose gets care.  Without that, legally obligated try treat everyone least try find somewhere get treatment, waste time kill patients might otherwise saved. Yeah agree. speaking Canadian perspective, population health concern right best care elderly terms LTC managing chronic diseases inherently come age baby boomers getting older. years forward, generation suffering greatly COVID related long-term issues, strain healthcare system costly. Local idiots idioting again. cause ripple effect across country goes long enough. really, trying tie virus, work comp claim, get money.

Its disgusting money grab. Got it.. That’s literally said lol give Texas back Mexico please? Except prisons make great incubators contagious diseases. there’s one thing I’ve learned growing first responder it’s pizza party hero bullshit ends dollar. soon want good insurance, raise, disability forget stuff it’s “ job help people”. teachers college student, apparently getting Vaccine 2nd phase rather 3rd, follow news, second get vaccine, drive local CVS fast possible get shit veins. she-balls.

Hang 'em testicals and/or ovaries! didn’t say less dangerous you’re stupid think it’s dangerous. get covid, doesn’t matter around 50 people, 1000000 people one dude named Dwayne, got it. Summer concerts happen 2021. cannot go another year loss. inner fascist thinks would much easier forcibly vaccinated them. arrest them, vaccinate them, let go. tazer works shooting two barbed needles skin semi random placement bad hold vaccinate them.

Sadly there's two doses needed BioNTech-pfizer vaccine, maybe wait one need two doses put holding cell week.

Just keep register people get vaccinated. compare housing registration (from tax records etc) go houses people vaccinated non medical reasons nurse two policemen. say either get vaccine voluntarily fined amount money they're held fined larger amount money. Problem solved. fine even comply encourage people actually turn appointments opposed deciding vaccinated home would convenient.

Since people told happen beforehand get people go appointments. Give people 2 chances get appointment time(with fine miss first one). miss send round vaccine squad. Make vaccinations done time 24/7(run people vaccinations shifts). Make mandatory employers give employees time vaccinations. Make vaccine free person recieving it. Give people every chance turn vaccinated, fail use vaccination squad.

Yeah they'll cry violation rights(which probably would be) point say fuck it, they're endangering others willful stupidity. like they'll stop antivaxxers forcibly vaccinate them. It'll miss homeless unregistered people it'd get enough coverage work.

Does completely bypass kind trial system, yes. terrifyingly dystopian, also yes. would work. Air travel got damn near every corner globe couple months. Florida. livid idiots city post town's fb page complaining virus numbers false, hospitals labelling everyone dies ""Covid"" death get money, etc...
Meanwhile one idiots went work nursing home mom gave entire wing 15 seniors Covid. Again, ANGRY. pray idiots get it, live physical ramifications, pay nose FOREVER. think form just-world fallacy. Oh beautiful must good person. Oh successful must hard worker. Oh homeless bought Starbucks coffee everyday. That's companies trial participants every news network, Dr. Oz last week likely media go distribution begins.  Auto accident claims adjuster, health insurance course. Brendon shcaubs gonna going crazy. new car?! true, mind reporting every time I'm done accepting terrible parts society. time highlight get changed. I’m sorry people living state care them. Full profit people keep businesses running lulling citizens feeling like everything fine rest world reacting. It’s tough lesson learn, none dies becomes critically, chronically ill it, made bad mistake lucky. Can’t unfortunately doubt take long I've got lot lot anger this, find cathartic unleashing idiots like this. know I'll never change mind, I'd rather direct people care about. herd immunity kick 20-30% population already infected recovered? Ok sorry. Hey everybody, fuck everyone else, allowed feel sorry guy whomever approves sympathy. 

Where FUCK say ok party socialize? fuck say people hard time going without socialization important everyone else? fuck throwing CAPS me? I'm throwing parties? I'm telling people throw parties. Stop? Stop what? Commenting reddit? aware death rate is? Lol That’s I’m doing. won’t even give 5 minutes go kitchen make toast without approaching me. stay room, going bathroom kitchen need food, won’t even stay away tiny amount time takes people stuck working stadium? person gets sick goes super market go to. one person making choice effects self highly possible 12 million might need vaccine since already virus? Chillingly relevant *The Atlantic* article:

[How many Americans die? new analysis shows country track pass spring’s grimmest  friend lives Florida always sharing videos partying huge numbers maskless people. asked evidence restaurants contributed surge cases. provided evidence. wanted clear evidence specifically outdoor dining asked. SINCE ASKED, we’ll see experts said... [not good, champ.  Man sub full pussies Ummmm... Holy shit ridiculous. going try convince group 50+ less dangerous group 3 it’s gonna happen. That’s stupid. thousands millions people visit other, live together groups 3. guess must responsible insane spread made 3 people groups! idea sick many people get admitted hospital. normal intensive care work, way extreme. This, sucks students right colleges think stagger departure days anything. brother forced move dorm fly home, said flight completely full :( least he's self isolating think be... Welcome America. Land screw working class, especially rich Trump forced us crap, smh. It’s huge venue, group runs remodeled encourage social distancing. announced shutting back today, one last places reopen. Sure limited many people allowed enter, Jesus man, don’t think anything deserve getting operating license removed. Maybe read article, offered masks, shut back down. seems they’re one responsible bar/club owners area here. employees/owners clubs bars organized protests months ago open back up. seems perfect example self regulating. property one hottest city, probably ranks one expensive, yet still decided shut back really can't even try reason them. even believe ""the good book"" seems problem going take care fuck about? really idea atrocities US military government committed? really want us bow listen blindly? fuck dude. Really?  They're performance artists putting real life showing ""The Last Supper."" Humans creatures habit US so. Fauci seen pandemics US dealt one while. 

He saw coming, especially Trump helm GOP let bribery charges without witness period US first cases. even hear evidence then, would trust evidence anything else?

I'm part. two types anti-vaxers. religious anti-vax trust issues anti-vax. religious anti-vax Christian Scientists, Mennonites, orthodox Jewish etc. 

The group grows shrinks based perceived risk public trust government, pharmaceutical health care. Taking measles example, group less likely vaccinate pharmaceutical scandal like asbestos baby powder, health care professional fuck like two babies killed improperly mixed vaccinations Samoas. 

In US outbreak community, raising risk fear vaccinating, anti-vax shown rush vaccinate vaccination rates communities remain high years afterwards. 

The ""measles going sweep across country kill us all"" media anti-vax fearmongering never anything worry still isn't.  lol @ scared losers sub jealous people enjoying life probably won’t even get sick. Trying? 🤪 It’s Texas. WTF people expect? Hell yeah 2a work EMS clinicals many hospitals. scary see amount people coming getting intubated put ventilators... us later find test positive covid. One example, small hospital, less 6 hours 5 people intubated. either tested positive previously never recovered.

I want emphasize, high survival rate mean won’t struggle months months. friend currently it. survived... also developed encephalopathy, cardiomyopathy, a-fib. virus nothing play around guys... part stop going unnecessary places while, over. people keep going out... end spreading everyone hurting family friends many people. Stop going out. faux one thats made recycled bottles makes look like goldendoodle makes happy. love fur look, would faux vintage. China makes sense, standards animal treatment quite different there. clearly haven’t read dune 1.39 million individual lives, like yours. People families, friends children. Yet call “rounding error.” Disgusting. 

Literally every single doctor health care professional disagrees you. wrong zero evidence credible source back idiotic statement. That’s great news me. read numbers 10% down. I’m going check numbers. Y'know dude. hard sympathy anymore. understand incredibly hard away family everyone knowingly goes large gathering, ignores social distancing rules, masks wear proper protective gear, maintain cleanliness basically risking covid.

And sucks. I've worked covid unit 8 months now. 12 hours night I'm risking health population listen public health guidelines believe covid infection happen them.

I still give damn good patient care empathy time low. It’s important note lot travelers could college students. schools in-person learning sent students home past Friday, thousands people fly drive home campuses shuttering. least school, people allowed remain campus break students nowhere else go, largely students can’t get back home countries students may sheltering away bad home environments. stupid real somebody paying you? I’m actually okay this. I’ll take downvotes shouldn’t messing restaurants another stimulus passed. going hurt lot workers. many travel Thursday... something similar Christmas, cook side dishes, swap dad cooks. eat home connect online. Meh, EMS getting middle finger government since began. somebody downvote that? Partially closed. Davis square bars outside drinking. dont even understand reason masks. protect everyone else you. They're trying assuage guilt using us it. I'm interested, people tell feel them. Yes, BioNTech original developer vaccine. workout home. found cheap weights FB Marketplace. I'm hoping find exercise bike cheap soon. 

I know things hard, small adjustment make. big sacrifice. see lot people saying surge right result Halloween (among general lack protocol) haven’t seen anyone really mention street parties Biden announced president elect. Don’t get wrong, voted happy he’s president elect didn’t celebrate outside household. bringing seems silly ignore it. Ding ding ding!!! winner!!  Oh, absolutely. selfish. see logic, care surviving Covid not. to. Reason dead.

The thing people recognize physical boundaries; absence appeal reason unreasonable. happening massive wave? Like don’t understand harm could do. They’d lose tourist revenue sure they’d still get some. wouldn’t killing 50 people day like gonna get worse. Here’s cease &amp; desist letter FDA telling Xlear stop promoting spray Covid cure. cites study referenced above. article posted prove dining major contributor LA dining hasn’t indoor since start Covid, article seem focus outdoor dining. Obviously, would foolish post article doesn’t relate post’s topic hand “proof” something. Large Thanksgiving followed small Christmas funeral. 👍🏼 blame both. Politics wrong inaction, people wrong responsible. Even politicians inadequate, contradictory self serving, make right everyone be.

I understand logic laying down, think makes right. sound like fun friend! /s. You’re right. massive failure Trump administration. leadership moment crisis, millions people getting sick hundreds thousands dying. Everyone shares house respectful towards you. Asking distance demanding. say doctors texas refuse treat republicans. Two play game. point, level community spread, there's way know someone contracted it. won’t. mayor control. control schools opening closing. also thought that’s may hit state’s threshold said response people angered schools shut gyms dining.

Cuomo today announced plan shutting nyc. hit 3% tests returned positive 7 day average total 10 days move orange zone shuts indoor dining, gyms, hair salons. 7 day average 2.5% stayed 8 days now.

It would probably take least 5 days reach 3.0% 7 day average needs 10 days that. you’re looking probably minimum 15 days indoor dining shut.

It would need hit 4.0% 10 days close outdoor dining likely soon.  That's good one   Iowa too. Mayo clinic common place people serious condition sent. Pregnant women complications, children undiagnosed conditions, accident victims, adults serious illness, etc. Yeah, mink farms probably shut anyway. see points. chance people get infected frozen food really small. think better send test kits countries facing severe outbreaks. That's good thought. refuses use technology, thinks get hit hidden costs. cell phone, let us email photos her, thinks charged. asks us print photos (which actually cost money) mail (which costs money!) Looool. good idea could place orders her! think that's wise decision? Lol stop believing fear mongering bullshit. people played Idk made chuckle. Nice work tiny, covert human! 1000s americans came China ""china ban"" small portion actually quarantined. majority got temp check airport told self quarantine, unsupervised. 

That quarantine. change wish see world routine testing work. symptoms reason suspecting it. didn’t even know tested day. Thank judgement though! Hahaha sweet. see getting downvoted... +1 me. live NC shocked see many empty driveways looked front window around midnight last night. many people away holiday. realize things said misconstrued? okay, denial. Texas sucks tHaNk HeRoEs!!!!11!!!!111! husband’s cousin got married yesterday. don’t know many people attended wedding obviously didn’t go, know “kept small” due Covid. least 10 people bride’s paternal side family alone, I’m guessing 40 so. part baffles she’s ICU nurse NYC hospital. people know better! small quantity idiots vaccinated last month ;) judging people least college fund draw protect family.

Murphy well early pandemic. blood hands don’t. you’re locking virus 99.7% survival rate, you’re moron. 

Stay inside. won’t miss you. Redditors lmao Yes, sides. Heres someone involved moon landings take opposite side things, heres muppet conspiracy theorist lives parents basement. like season's final episode Game Thrones still good. We've seen politics build years, finally comes violence drama everybody participants expecting time.

It's going pretty way starting new season. don’t “rush them”, what’s best solution? Well also promise look till get feet cliche sounds. I'm relying only, lot pressure one person also hate sitting ass. He's also pragmatic person we've discussed things quite times still are. 
Tysm! That's led ww2 takeover Nazis begin with. Thank explaining me. Texas teachers told same. Can't even get disability pay because, ""you can't 100% certain got school."" What? took 5 years get disability approved. initial reason denial could move arms legs. use them.

All people fine 

Stop afraid.  Pulling kids school locking parents’ business protect octogenarians pants head stupid. 

You wanna stay inside? Stay inside. idiot MIL trying visit past weekend husband flat-out told no. seen since January going weddings carrying like normal. husband pacemaker son (my husband) heart condition well. would ""apparently"" devastated caught covid insisted get see us. told come we'd wave car 🤷‍♀️ hurt. eventually changed mind gonna come granddaughter child exposed work. HATE HATE HATE mentality absolutely see someone. Let us fucking live see us later. Ugh disgusted I'm thinking we'll need wait Thanksgiving weekend know difference last &amp; year people may cancel day even show flight without calling. getting harder take thing seriously. read article said North Dakota hardest thing. 1 thousand north Dakotans died Rona. average guy 80 years old. know thousand people. I'm sure big deal statistical perspective non issue virus impacting life. lockdowns what's getting me. I'll wear mask, give shit sacrificing economy sanity save someone else's grandpa know. Asians wear masks. Mericans dont school completely closing break, I’m even allowed stay pay them. I’m driveable distance I’m super stressed, reading thread makes feel awful friends school live far away choice Going work right Christmas, seriously know I'm going survive Thanks! understand this, people need use airplanes get home things like college 7 day average rate per 100k 29 LA County.

Below Thanks. Yeah definitely know that's like. Hang friend. social contract prevents us turning Christmas alone last year. actually nice day. talking family phone, made sure favourite lunch, wine, good movie. Took nice afternoon nap cat. holiday alone good opportunity spoil bit - indulgent food, play new video game, sink hours book you’ve wanting read etc. Thank concern. us working COVID patients already COVID - whole family last month. like weird flu (I'm thankful like many others), tolerance exercise much less weeks (decreased endurance, subjective occasional breathlessness... someone used long distance running, weird).

Not sure writing this... glad vaccine may horizon. Dude - hang - 2 months Abbott Republicans start blaming everything President Biden. far, 23 Texas correctional officers died COVID-19.

Wait. happened Blue Lives Matter? really link feb article november? much known then? Lol thanks hadn’t seen yet! takeout. food good ppl come support it, surely. ones us making sacrifices much minority. virus May, got essential employee. still wear mask social distance it’s right thing do. I'll one better. Selling avocado toast. sounds like ahead game, smart move. Yes, correct- cannot apply disability United States citizen. medicare/aid unless someone wants correct me. 

Anecdotally, I've seen many people attempt come think ""I'll figure get there, take care get feet""- almost never happens way, system chews spits hurry. happy planned got strategy down. 

I meant said welcome you. course hindrance goals, that's anywhere. Truly, wish best luck both. sure either vaccine gathered efficacy data one shot.

I see couldn't. People trial still people things 4 weeks shots. 

But data relevant drug submitted prescribed use. I'd bit surprised made first shot enough seriously mitigate covid 

In traditional vaccines least, would. awhile. would rage back.

The 2nd shot needed 'set' immune response. participants mild side effects 2nd dose first. 2nd body learns bastards come back swarms it'll stay ready, goes Bill Murray vs gopher it.

In future, ideally, exposed virus ""in wild"" much smaller 'doses', body recognize quickly pick stray little buggers without knowing happened, like pathogens anyone ""immune"" to. Exactly this. wanted stay dork campus 25 dollars per night January 19th. ticket home 29 dollars. Like excess money weather pandemic. I'm loss words people look fact people absolutely choice whatsoever Look street parties Covid surging.

North Dakota heart epidemic I'm sure street parties ND pretty solid Trump. compare metro non-metro areas cases per capita double rural areas. (obviously assuming metro areas bluer rural).

NYC slow growth cases yet seen surge could correlated celebrations. Currently areas worse right mostly ones went Trump (Yes conservative parts city !)

The celebrations saw mostly masked outside orders magnitude safer drinking indoors bar.

But absolutely people avoid gathering together large numbers inside much possible. Wearing masks would prevented lot misery dealing with. Uh, HELLO??? sympathy left give people. Remember article couch potatoes heroes right whatever. HAHAHAHA. hermit losers going pathetic lives subsidized praised anymore. We're going normal, bitches. Thanks kind words! I'm glad posts helpful. :) 

Yep, remember stories too. sad think situation region could better everyone Sweden behaved similar ways neighbors: there's reason outcome much like Norway's Finland's. yes, shocking sad. I've spent years referencing Sweden's leadership traffic safety car seat safety particular, watching government follow anti science policies just...strange.

Well specific background do, generally always looked Sweden model rational, humanistic approach government yep, strategy is... Strange. put mildly. 

Thank sharing thoughts! American tradition. gives shit think Lysol wipes paper towels Tampa area bar/club scenes look like also. St. Pete's, Clearwater, Tampa, Ybor, even Brandon local bars. packed, super sweaty, drunk, mask less get Uber. Thanks guess, Uber seems scare enough people wearing even want to, can't bars? time numbers much worse California hard lockdown year Oh extrapolation 100% exposure definitely unrealistic.

Nice chatting you, too. yearly traditional tent burnin' don’t live Texas, someone “essential” worker told go back working high risk office environment January even though we’ve successfully working home since April (my job requires phone laptop, laptops already used phones home) - notion might even eligible workers compensation die super enraging. It’s something we’ve raised union there’s relevant precedent live nobody answers.

When think incredibly severe law wearing safety toed shoes, usually incredibly infinitesimal risk - level cavalier disregard employ safety around COViD blows my
Mind. Sick. Imagine anything resembling leader right now, might otherwise damn clue anything. Oh well. Probably insulated box dry ice keeping cold - normal freezers can’t handle dry ice. Yea COVID there. Florida crazy already wild people news stories COVID scared IT! doing, instead focusing closing businesses angering healthy low-risk people telling can’t go friends go gym, focusing building infrastructure provides high risk people need live lives (groceries, etc) without telling entire world pause.

Focus protecting helping vulnerable, handcuffing struggling small businesses chastising people going grab drinks friends. Yup, Indiana ( hospital rhymes scent) saying liable healthcare worker getting covid-19 work even though treated patient confirmed covid-19 time wearing PPE. nothing ever gets past mask... even though virus airborne surgical mask adequate airborne precautions. would also require China provides truthful data. understanding: Instead asking everyone stay home they've exposed regardless whether they're contagious even infected, people instead asked take daily tests tell they're contagious. Contagious people stay home. work workers’ compensation. come surprise Reddit, Texas really awful WC laws. going COVID-19 virus, WC doesn’t usually cover viruses they’re considered “diseases life,”just like wouldn’t normally able make WC claim died flu common cold, even caught work. HOWEVER, states passed presumption law COVID-19 presumes virus arises course employment WC cover it. TX done this, knowledge. think early pandemic, since expired. sell already fridge. Excuse evil language puts `;` behind `if` block? also formatting. 1% fraudulent.

The real fraud insurance companies/Worker's Comp worker. Lying, sacks shit, are. Brazil giving promise ring essentially. Drive thru realistic alternative small business owners restaurants shut down.  ok, one we're continually denied. So, 9/11 responders again? ""NEVER 4GET HEROES"" 

 *immediately forgets* Unbelievable Sure family sad think understand -- rich people's *money* stake. Texan, gotta say FUCK TEXAS. state many people like man wrong. They've let virus flourish lack action. son born 10 days, setting COVID tents temporary morgues hospital overflowing. family friend one hospitals ventilator entire hospital ran sedation meds give patients ventilators, they've scramble find solutions. much hospital staff either quarantine hospital unable work. insane. sad thing going get worse idiots cancel Thanksgiving Christmas. Fuck state. entire family taking pretty seriously. one sister questionable LT police. Im taking seriously. country hates, loathes, absolutely despises, anyone isn’t wealthy well-connected. That's socialized healthcare hobbled politicians seek destroy institutions contract buddies. Like system, needs funding protection survive.

I get political that, subreddit. Ok Mr ""hospitals capacity bodies burning pits"" blame both. Everybody think themselves. Unfortunately seems like never do. That’s got cold think everyone moved parties indoors. hope see significant number people continue take precautions first dose, contract COVID, mouth social media vaccine work. could prevent people vaccinated getting it, think useless. anyone sent thoughts prayers? hope sneaky mention pizzagate consipiracy nutjobs loved ones getting vaccinated first opportunity. care about. Everyone else responsible bad choices. Apparently greatest country world also dumbest much pay you? read somewhere reddit there's state insurance regulator state call tell bullshit dealing with. thought lpt post cannot find now. matter unless I'm personally affected

That's alright. don’t know... numbers shocking - 10,000 dead one week? week! remember week... it’s short time. Canada recently passed 10,000 dead (currently 11k). response seems really inadequate leaders trying, lockdowns happening.

For reason hit hard. I’ve got family US. concerts 10,000 people. think people dead. 

It horrifying. appalling people still arguing details, masks, conspiracies... bodies piling up, hospitals swamped. 

What going on? people even argue? 

I understand 123archer mean, really do. think know right going start asking 10,000 means besides money. 

Be safe. Spreading disease Thanksgiving tradition! Man that’s sad. I’m optimistic things month now. I've convinced previously hardcore antivaxxer friend take vaccine becomes available. simple information process vaccine works it. feel like pretty successful campaign fence get access right info. it? I've never cruise. seems pretty cheap. take someone else 200 person.  politician epidemiologist judge office. governor needs take decisions affect people’s lives take everything consideration, accepting painful trade offs. RIP brother. probably got work hence “in line duty”. Fuck ever blocking family. regards second paragraph.

You need accept people catch this, percentage people die. It’s going happen.

The idea “separate societies” silly. shouldn’t that. one society BEST protect need it/want it, understand it’ll imperfect accept certain level death.

We don’t ban restaurants carrying shellfish menu small percentage customers deadly allergy; take many precautions possible keep customers safe, allow restaurant continue business usual.

What we’ve shutting entire restaurant; literally figuratively. Exactly Mitch didnt want give money Jon Stewart pushed envelope, exact reason wouldnt allow another stimulus exempted employers. 

There going lot claims like this.  behavior determined wanting keep job get kicked grocery store, give fuck more. dad's thousand miles away basically hermit virus, he's mixing now. probably care somebody else's grandpa know, don't, 8 months know anyone who's seriously harmed virus. Meanwhile dismantling sectors economy nothing help workers, keeping nail salons open telling people can't see families holidays. could keep bars open summer seems prices listed WSJ article must include memorial. Either that, WSJ readers/NYC government schmucks getting taken cleaners.

The prices direct cremation generally much much lower. distance NYC: 

NYC: [""Direct cremation New York City generally obtained around $700 – $900 depending cremation services provider select. ... direct cremation available throughout Manhattan, Brooklyn, Bronx, Queens Staten Island PA: $1,816 average, $700 via funeral home, $175 $300 actual cremation process Louis, MO: City, MO: City, KS: searching that, I'm really interested Google ads get week... Folks gotta understand. People workforce like fifty dollar band-aid cost hospital quarter. overhead still wanna charge extra two bits.  Already along wife. 2 days leg aches, cough congestion. Within week back working running. flu Christmases ago, worse. real problem. wife clinical pharmacist infected week ago hospital. She’s feeling pretty good luckily, congestion, hospital 200+ employees currently said. know that's bit topic far, 23 Texas correctional officers died COVID-19.

And there's people still saying fucking flu It’s nice hear someone talking actual herd immunity, morally bankrupt thing everybody gets Covid whole lot people die call day. I'm sorry went that. life gotten kinder ? get worked out? thought that's pretty standard. remember going weeklong cruise $700ish. applied food stamps, threw bunch options qualified let ke know options, also registered vote.

Truly California socialist hellscape. Interesting, I've never heard that. know married ppl disability support? I'm sure sure thing? perhaps coming story may make people realize gatherings worth it.

Nah, going happen. exact stories coming since pandemic started basically, always new ""If knew."" stories. *internal screaming* Fake news That’s literally 1984 type shit. You’re dumb times 10,000 coming 10 days Thanksgiving.  We’re gonna die! Well would dead person need benefits? like use them! /s I’m reminded 9/11 aid held up. wonder John Stewart Covid benefits be... #**DO NEED SHOOT WELFARE OFFICER SOMETHING?** dont know Scomo came really low popularity Bushfire crisis whilst Hawaii relatively ok crisis approval reflects that. could better, didnt fuck badly. canceled Thanksgiving plans father, seen since January. Let say people going ahead gatherings: fuck everything hold dear.  Plenty ""surviving"" going Florida. snowbirds head South Dakota winter business booking. Doors open head over. Yeah another 10 years Jon Stewart gonna take cause. fucks sake.  appears failed... Everyone feel bad now... friends laid drive Amazon right now. bad gig meantime Thanksgiving others mean Christmas alone many Americans. Korea New Zealand islands rest world. It’s magnitude easier contain situation. much popular 15% memory.

In event, earned 70% - things like daily briefings soforth. government stuffed quarantine hotel, really worked ensure public buy act. Yes, unjust. comment referring literally lived outside denied assistance didn’t kids recently moved NJ Europe. governor seems like sensible person. No, want keep funneling money overextended airline companies.

They’re worried citizens. everyone? lol Yeah, stories like important helps bring home reality transmission easily happen make one exception rules ""doing right things"". kind communication much useful ranting dumb, selfish, entitled everyone (much agree frustration). feels like really don’t understand plight people actually can’t leave homes. aunt uncle, serious health issues, outgoing giving people. always big events house staples community.

They aren’t leaving house want to, it’s flat don’t choice. uncle dinner plate sized hole side lung wide open world. aunt lifelong smoker COPD.

They CANT leave it’s heartbreaking. Normal cannot come soon enough rest family planning many things zoom time prepping stuff afterwards mental health hurting virus worse. 

We haven’t lockdown NYC months. Tbh yes... would feel way, parents already quarantining. indefinite prisoners protect old farts idiocy? Everything changes beginning 4 weeks second vaccine dose becomes readily available. I’m giving single moment past that. point elderly infirm exercise *their* freedom stay inside long want. guess new ideas, think phased approach many states implementing good balance. People eat go gym long positivity rates stay manageable levels hospitals occupancy rates stay low enough. 

I might agree actually way healthy young people completely form separate society us want bit cautious right now, think that's feasible hopefully last months.   

I think businesses forced shut cases spike receive compensation, workers find unemployed result. outdoor public spaces probably remain open, still want socialize outdoor options well homes. Well spending money moves economy economy provides essential services entire population vulnerable depend survival... it’s really simple make it... old you? plenty shit. homeless three years hearing. it’s 4% Holocaust. man tried beat that, looks like fail. wipe everything get made fun told I'm overreacting. I'd rather overreact underreact. Well man good luck, really hope get better. Paranoid delusions nothing laugh about. shouldn’t harsh. want bubble boy near future suppose it’s hurting yourself. Good luck. Whilst terrible lost Father, dont think would withheld reason barring thought best thing based balance probablities would expect. Americans still buy ""stuff"". fewer opportunities spend money experiences, even spent things.

And percentage Chinese GDP depends American tourists? Hint: little spoil party one bit.  Pendejos, oh it’s culture blah blah blah. Stop blaming culture lack sense. Stop narrow minded. bet voted trump elections. Even tore kids away families. Well, Singapore road rail links (with Malaysia), short boat ride away (from Indonesia). Oh Texas,,,why make want cry? lockdowns arent empathy

you think old people wanna stay locked day unable see grandkids? I’m anti-vaxxer means, there’s way hell I’m taking vaccine rushed bunch capitalists hell bent reopening economy. Okay thanks much response! Long Beach takeout

Tom Yum Pizza best Dear Lord people going hell. Like needed extra shit deal aneurys. I've compared dieting many times!

Not trivialize covid anything, much incremental spread, rationalization, justification denial same. Yup.  It’s killing spirit us. Fuck Texas. Might well Afghanistan.   Dr. Atlas fucking fraud. much choose respect fact. really there. Greatest night ever. Yes, people massive blind spots. half state ignoring governor case. We've faired quite bit better tham 4 neighbors (who #1, #2, #3, #4 country cases per capita), luck seems run rural areas take attitude neighboring states had.  overview, state Illinois.

Ive following experts majority pandemic ( bit ignorant Lombardy got creamed). Im going stop listening now. Life many Americans likely back mostly normal summer unless something unforeseen interrupts vaccine devolpment. Sadly, it'll gift many people accept science. There's real tragedy. hey guys, thanksgiving, right?  **""Most rural areas hospitals closed due lack funding.""** \- pure BS glossed try prove point without anything back up. 

There 6k hospitals US 120 rural hospitals closed since 2010. small percentage way create issue discussed post. IE: Closure rural hospitals = many rural people big-city Yeah, can’t remember holiday give virus laden blankets native americans not? Viruses Thanksgiving. American apple pie. Wired excellent reporting pandemic. didn’t expect tbh. Also cost efficient: AstraZenica vaccine doesn’t need extreme cold storage transportation. union strike rule fake union. Get together members start unofficial union sickout. Haha means much. 328 million people much need dose this, number lot lot less. helps people work healthcare mainly preventing sickness. Also helps people could better response vaccine Misleading title. combined result half full regimen, full/full regimen. think simple, imo, due urgency. Plenty pharmaceutical companies received funding set production lines pre-approval I'm assuming (and could wrong) easy switch produce competitor's vaccine (plus whatever intellectual property stuff go they're different companies) I'm expecting multiple vaccines market produced time take get. Makes blood boil  make vaccine sound cool? I'm disappointed that's what's it. Oh, worry, he'd abusive piece shit months.

He pretty much wiped ass RIVM (Dutch CDC) guidelines Corona initially, saying ""it's flu"", week past easter.

I one either, first one walk out.

I'm absolutely sympathetic problems, troubled times whole thing landed store in, mean lash weeks end employees.

...

Now, kicker, give context: get time loss family. ... pretty much verbatim responded.

I really feel bad guy, despite little less asshole last months worked there, seriously, crossed lines again, people snapped.

...

TL;DR: worse context history months horrible relationship.  would definitely hope so. husband planning try another baby next summer, means may cutting close, get get pregnant. seems like vaccine approved, phases receive it. experts saying young, healthy people last receive it, 2021 think saw somewhere possibly 2022 based predictions. maybe unable get vaccine, employer continue encourage WFH wear mask go office?  remotely comparable. compare Hawaii New Zealand want that's it. worse visiting all, better getting tested visiting. least way people test positive cancel visits. Yep, exactly. It’s drastic backup plan desperate scenario. Andrea, cannot leave house walk dog exercise. US A.

 Thanks incredibly intelligent thoughts. US. 

I asked rural states seeing surge (Dakotas, Iowa, etc) seen cases peak start decline.

That topic hand. stay focused.

Even testing increases cases increasing decreasing Dakotas Iowa?? Exactly. Science stagnant. 1978 42 years ago know making safe vaccines. compare science 42 years ago helpful, imo. else going meet goals glacier melting?  Why? framework dealing covid disaster scenarios. Would rather agency tasked thinking kind thing plan?  Seems like votes don’t agree you. Story 2020 seems. Take super power last 1000p years they’re guilty stealing land enslaving people.  finally got Medicare Expansion Virginia, late rural hospitals.

Most smaller hospitals also labor doctor attached, again, mother going labor might two-three hour drive ahead her. Bingo. Guys... gay use toilet paper? Sadly knew would play out... 

Trumpets want take risks ‘country folk survive’ get sick gotta go hospitals city... 

If competency, rural areas low infection areas low population density. didn’t happen. victim blaming thread hilarious. guys really get idea people catching COVID could slogan entire American response. leaders going Americans make decisions. THEY? Salmon expensive don’t mega churches lol point.  fuck would hundred people town?

And everyone like everyone hillbilly trumper either. 

Shocking know.

About 60% voted Trump. yeah it’s 100% either way. don’t see difficult understand. feel like infection virus 60 million world wide cases now, decent number random permutations. Oh okay yeah flipping away open tab absolutely problem, lie that. think frequency zone stop listening normal session though. ADHD fun.....

Nobody said gives immunity. Learn read crying reddit, it'll save grief. absurd policy certainly absurd applied here. efficacy part trial over: interim, met endpoint. There's still ongoing US trial, design full + full shot sounds like going problem FDA gets readout. 62% efficacy going cut 94%,95% mRNA vaccines. probably need add half + full arm COV003 fast humanly possible want even chance they'll get FDA EUA. also cause serious constipation take much it, girlfriend learned. careful. data prevalence ""long-haulers"" aside anecdotes? highly doubt remotely common people suffer literally *permanent* (as they're often presented) side-effects mild infection lasts less week (which majority infections young people are). Watch 8 people. machine starts beeping prisoners/guardsman load body onto trailer slap new one in.

That site infomercial selling test kits, real science. Yeah, job. little one sided say ""back Earth... problems largely own,"" excuse boss dealing problems paid deal with. 

I work industry rapidly scramble keep production transitioned work home. hard months, bosses never acted callously towards team, professionals.  person living so-called ""third world"" everyone keeps referencing (Brazil), I'm cautiously optimistic results. agree price storage important factors, I'm really worried logistics two different doses one month apart. big country, would likely result lot wasted vaccines. great public health system consider everything else, particularly good vaccination campaigns, really hard get people 1) act they're immune first dose; 2) come back second shot one month; 3) keep track actually got first vaccine (some people definitely try trick system giving ""stronger"" shot first).

I know one two-doses vaccine offered public system here, one HPV. Numbers drop dramatically first dose, meaning lot people simply bother coming back second shot. 

I'd like know numbers one full dose compare get one low dose. Since two high doses gets 60%, I'm imagining results encouraging. hard choice make. comes me, course I'd rather optimal low-high regimen, follow general I'm afraid lot people stop one low dose.

Amazon bunch sale. bought $30 one seems working. true 48 participants results posted yet. definitely outdoor setups meant mitigate spread functionally indoor setups, hurt situation further. I’m you, biggest issue lack enforcement rules combined lack stimulus allow things like indoor dining closed. long bigger issues don’t change, would nice see small steps taken towards fixing issue. I'm sure Oxford Pfizer vaccines, we've also seen uptick volunteered infections too. Normally people purposefully infected test vaccine, especially mortality rate high COVID. volunteered likely sped trial periods significantly well. (albeit participants, likely placebo, survived sadly) going come states, usual. states highest regular vaccination rates requirements are, incredibly, two poorest least educated: Mississippi West Virginia. Mandatory religious/personal exemption allowed. 99% vaccinated...my assumption COVID added list.

This primarily required attend public schools. kids country get vaccinated. 

Employers choice make - whether worth fight battle. weigh vaccinations kind. Nope, protester demographic goes home spends Thanksgiving holiday families, parents grandparents filling hospitals. Oh aware something wrong Gardasil vaccine. remember mom making get soon came out. arm hurting fine. ""Just 2 weeks!"" Yes did. picked USA posted picture Instagram biking contagious COVID weird flex everyone that's worried pandemic. started hitting mainstream news took pretended never happened. said even worse things podcast feels people taking pandemic minimal public health protections government taken.

Brendan ""he's comedian folks"" schaub A) vaccine effective (90%) American vaccines administered correctly 

B) it’s much cheaper produce 

C) it’s much easier transport doesn’t need stored -70 degrees

D) uses adenovirus delivery vector, new therefore known safe long term. mRNA vaccine American vaccines brand new nobody knows long term affects 

E) Pfizer’s vaccine mostly funded Germany 

Conclusion: America definitely got KO sorry disappointed slightest surprised. first graphic literally entitled:
 COVID-19 Activity Indicators: Laboratory, Outpatient/Emergency Department, **Hospitalization** Mortality Data
 1, 2020 - November 14, 2020.
 
Additionally, section entitled *Key Points* third bullet point states:
 overall cumulative COVID-19-associated hospitalization rate week ending November 14, 2020, 228.7 hospitalizations per 100,000 population. 

Reading hard. TSA reports two million travelers last two days. much going explode? **Long term immunity, looking Campbell*  No. original discussion Lambo Ferrari. spoken. hope won’t time capsule time *thought* really bad pandemic—but which, retrospect, seems complete holiday compared pandemic followed.

(In short, may governments learned lessons year put practice prevent another, far worse pandemic. go back January 1, 2020, factory farming failures stockpile masks all, we’re screwed.) heard opposite, put higher priority advising positive tests vs. negative. patents owned University spinoff Vaccitech, full for-profit company. They've using lot weasel words ""It'll non-profit **during pandemic.**""

Compare Moderna NIAID owns several patents it. Moderna candidate much governmentally owned vaccine.  pizzanista probably best pizza LA. arts district one still getting business. strange flipped politically. Anti-vaxxers used left wing anti-big pharma crowd. significant number belligerent antimaskers California. make badge honor go around dicknose chindiaper public places. brag defiant large private parties unmasked “prayer services” really social events. community spread due delusional people. School requirements force lot parents get kids vaccinated We’re already well north 20%. time vaccine comes there’s good possibility we’ll already 50%+. Remember disease experts saying reported numbers like 6-10x lower real count. It’s still net positive. People won’t drive say Burbank Ventura regular basis happy hour. able trust government opposed US where...


Can imagine Hilldog trying lock enforce masks? think non-zero possibility may preferable timeline sadly. Even thee quarantine, still worth IMO. Even symbolic solidarity people can't quarantine two weeks, thing right stay put. 
 
The way see it, like shaving head loved one cancer. utilitarian issue. saying people can't see family working high risk jobs front line, can't isolate two weeks ""we back together."" person like ""well, *I* reason see family..."" like person saying ""it's like shaved heads cure cancer anything."" Sure. still dick. rules thee Source? healthcare professionals could selfish patients... Well probably field. Sure good 10-30% probably money. Most(i imagine), least based 1 2 med friends, duty feel belong/make knowable difference. thing insurance policy good gives right sue insurance company. They'd still denying they'd catch virus spread everyone encounter ICU whichever rock live under... best $4 pie ever eaten. eviction yes would.

I'd love gig job crap right guess what? government cut stimulus unemployment, job still furloughed, landlord care. Fuck guess. Several 

Millions upon millions people 40 contracted virus. Maybe billion. sample several must good enough Yeah still cuts significantly. It’s like dam stops 95% water getting side. Leaks still happen. really is. sad best vaccine world people don’t trust it, won’t work.

Even typical vaccine enthusiasts fan particular one. thought huge mistake appoint guy financial stake Moderna used sit BOD head operation warp speed. Made look suspicious Moderna ended one front runners.

Sure maybe everything legit way played out, average person can’t possibly know possible ways conflicts interest trump public interest. 

And isn’t like hasn’t happened before, like opioid epidemic. health care system whole system inherent conflicts interest never great public trust. People don’t like thanksgiving need learn cook better. It’s far superior Christmas. gifts, good food, good drinks, work, family time. It’s American Independence Day, really, it’s personal.  How’s Hawaii comparison?  blaming group workers instead government providing proper goddamn support people stay home? Oh, I'm well aware. can't leave let back in. suggesting move right now. would think extremely hard impossible depending country. Also great caption whole year general... asymptomatic infections way less dangerous. Yes, could still spread virus body would know fight virus elderly know give single fuck. grandpa (who lives Florida) 94 he's going massive indoor funerals - usually people died COVID, dining indoors, visiting friends, etc. parents report elderly Florida similar. like they're sweet spot they're already close death utilitarian risk/reward balance tips towards living lives worrying it. 5 days give accurate early result isn’t creating camps people Covid; it’s handling Covid people camps. Huge difference. give restaurants guidelines set-up outdoor dining instead completely shutting down.

The restaurants street correctly. Spacing outdoor tables far apart, putting plexiglass tables. re-opened weeks ago making sure could set-up safely they're told shut again.

Pretty much signs point bulk transmission happening small indoor gatherings let's shut one activity might mitigate spread, going cause people gather indoors. logical thinking point. Oh oh go, Lets get military logistic chain moving now!!!!!!! find hospital capacity thing immediately shuts people arguing social distancing masks. 

ICUs failing brink failing virus surge. 

It’s hard argue freezer trucks piles bodies. Seriously though, know utah places charging almost $300 dollars damn covid TEST? think much treatment going be. FML Take whatever chances wish. looks like sucks royally. risk sake going dinner party bar seems magnificently foolish short-sighted. lot long haulers 50. 

To able run, walk stairs, damage cerebellum resulting person falling time, wake feeling like there's heavy weights legs, brain damage mini strokes clots...ugh...no thanks...I value independence freedom mobility, health, mental clarity give me. long term side effects concern vaccine? actually healthy people randomly develop conditions years later?

I thought concern rare side effects see high population, long timeline. trials much larger vaccine trials think. would play shit outta that. Python Deathclaws? Ghouls swamps since bombs? Yes please. don’t get these. remote island somewhere two people one died would saying that’s US equivalent 150 million people dying? everything spin back America? Several current vaccines new technology (mRNA vaccines) cannot compared mumps vaccine directly. would spend time reading them. 


I think lot people share concern, one them. point I'm gonna though - lasting effects vaccine unknown, lasting effects getting covid. case me. I’m 30s, older separate measles, mumps, rubella shots, required get 2 fresh MMR shots university went get another degree. issue get right away additional documentation. That’s sad. 60% wouldn’t enough full herd immunity. actually don’t think people Much choice believe. long hospital stays ICU treatment costs, can’t see situation health insurance company allows coverage without vaccinated without well documented, legit medical exemption. becomes business risk. Even employer provided plans.

“We know influenza need somewhere around 60% population immune herd protection, measles 95%. novel coronavirus probably going fall neighborhood 70% so,"" says Dr. Jeremih pretty well proven fucking hard 'shield' vulnerable populations even drastically lower levels community spread seen America unless dedicated staff (whom isolated population large).

In Victoria (which eventually managed eradication) virus still spread like wildfire nursing homes operating federal government guidelines prohibit shared staffing facilities, state run homes prohibited single death.

It's entirely possible, needs wider community support staff recognition must isolated community they're working in, big fucking ask hard maintain length time. Maybe much. bougie girl dog purse asking dog wants even gives thought. already shortage nurses pandemic. hospital already capacity COVID, anyone can't get bed ends taking space ED. Med/Surg overflow rooms OB floor enough people staff OB nurses trained take Med/Surg patients. Yep, vaccine specifically came department dedicated recouping funds university sex workers feel they're entitled circumvent state law make extra money?

Do understand socioeconomic system we've built works wherein can't pay food shelter dead?

The government providing people support need stay home fuck's sake. workers giggles. Shhh. You’re supposed talk Pfft. live rural area deliver me. Excellent news another vaccine coming. we're 3 way? Exactly. reminds people abortion also birth control. Like sane person positions.

It becomes obvious competing positions realize really preventing abortion, keeping status quo socioeconomic control women

Modern birth control allowed women actually sex fun, delay getting pregnant focus career, etc. allowed lot freedom latitude lived lives. joined workplace. stuck first dude knocked up. trapped bad relationships fear means provide. consequence eroded nuclear family, father sole provider, head family. allowed lot women claw towards equal standing men society

So totally consistent people anti-choice also anti-birth control. positions aligned motivations cofactors necessary? learning vitamindwiki.. primarily response article stating researchers ""discovered"" link. link discovered well 6 months ago.   right trials participants go lives normally, could mean quarantining risky? I’m sure add model? seen q-tips? Literally war crime. lot immigrant communities (due trust issues) seem big anti-vaxxers US (my experience area immigrant Somali community seems distrusting vaccines medical professionals general). Though, I'm sure we're going see special anti-vaxxers specific covid 'cause believe covid real, they're generally anti-vaccine. 


What grab bag! !RemindMe 2 years Unfortunately, means need wider-scale study. So, adding arm US COV003 likely, delay results. someone lost *finally* becoming airline pilot summer years training...PUT COACH! I'M READY PLAY! think age 12, though. apply younger children, particularly infants toddlers. Found dead-end Walmart middle manager. Today \~29k tests

Yes

29k :))))))))) I'm planning head line get vaccines. want chance study results &amp; finding jumping make mistake - absolutely plan get Covid Vaccine. however plan never, ever take vaccine matter what.

OMG, sounds like living hell. real life would manageable. zoom even moment one paying attention pick nose. bright side one notice fart. 😷 How? said italy September. say started italy. There's proof italy September. studies accounts suggest hospitalization rates much higher flu nearly age groups, including adults 40. There's also concern studies potential organ damage even mild cases long haul effects, long haul effects much prevalent flu (and much stranger/ variable). real concerns. 

They become less valid know millions people hardly anyone know gotten Covid (because know working safely home friends staying safe careful, think -- folks know got likely got workplaces spouse's workplaces). anecdotal I've seen also aligns data far. flu, vaccines horizon, anyone lucky enough avoid far careful still get vaccine can. 

The focus solely deaths ignores many aspects Covid present issues public health, potentially longterm depending long frequent issues persist. data fully awhile obviously still issue. course, deaths elderly, vulnerable, healthcare workers exposed directly definitely pressing issue vaccine delivery. production massive, think full rollout happening April, say. Waiting people jump pharmacy counter! JK live America. clearly remember multiple months straight-up denial blaming big cities. loss words what's happening shameful response federal government organizing covid rallies—removing social distancing signs, telling people liberate! Saying 99% affected! let covid control life! Covid Nov 4🔥👀 Ya, feeling run dry ice. Honestly, I'd take whichever became available first. Listen man seen stock photo text says “vaccines BAD” keep fake news peer reviews yourself. /s depends honestly that’s kind thing may want discuss doctor doctor *is* open knowledgeable supplements. concern typically rebound effect: kinda nutshell- take something long time, brain kinda goes “Cool! don’t need make this!” But, thing is: might actually need extra assist it’s working, generally don’t fix what’s broken.  said rushed hospital tested positive covid.  *developed* tax payer money, associated Warp Speed supplier, part deal operation receive almost 2 billion dollars deliver vaccine.

So although tax-payer money technically fund development, certainly incentivized it, receive source that? make sense. Well perhaps method used Pfizer/moderna studies, testing asymptomatic participants, massively harms reliability studies, yet one questioning them. really don’t understand definitive please don’t spread fact. necessarily, patients swabbed weekly check asymptomatic cases, whereas Pfizer swabbed patients showing symptoms. 40% people virus asymptomatic. Pfizer vaccine likely much closer 70% effectiveness. 
Moreover, traditional vaccine means understand risks much more.
It's also cheaper easier store.

This hailed We'll literally celebrating everyone else? Nice strawman lmao. 

Once get vaccine, stop quarantining. Thanks. curious come things. I'm guessing answer there's well established formula leads sound conclusions otherwise job, even though untutored eye numbers involved seem large enough representative sample. I'll take look.  crack facade? point there's risk people going gatherings thinking ""Well possibly COVID thanks test, go bars go cough grandma risk-free!"". possibilities false negatives getting infected test Thanksgiving, line thinking exactly airtight.  90% wasn’t statistically significant relied upon. Read article. 

Regardless 95% 90%. Like said - I’m going take Pfizer Moderna vaccine — people want take vaccine, I’m happy them! dont like seeing types comments suggest stay ""new"". time see posts ""whats hot"", negative comments downvoted hell. internet every single subreddit gets trash commenters, thats time comments get voted removed.

Also bubble anecdotes internet arent helpful. Like discussion rural areas population burden cities, could avoided easily. friends couldve born raised NYC exception rural towns, know. cant represent whole rural population, indisputably vast majority anti-mask.

this like cities people everyone board masks either. burden rest communities too. 28 Days Later... paper towels stores south florida lately...around me.

Bollocks.
"" data continue accumulate additional analysis conducted, refining efficacy reading establishing duration normal. evaluate data given number ""events"". intervals shorten participants reach 4 week + 15 day probably need add half + full arm COV003 fast humanly possible want even chance they'll get FDA EUA.

Perhaps we're scared virus (I certainly know would survive it) rather spreading vulnerable? know, actually care country unlike fake patriots. Go get sick care lol, literally body. However you, end affecting. rights end begin dipshit. think that's point /u/SapperInTexas making.

I think point people rural areas vote Republicans think take care want pay taxes etc. shit hits fans, need take advantage social services built bigger cities.

E) Pfizer/moderna trials tested participants symptoms, whereas Oxford trial tested participants weekly. Seeing least 40% cases asymptomatic, Pfizer/moderna efficacy results questionable  I'm still staying positive. 3 vaccine candidates seem offer relatively high degree protection. 

Makes wonder else could whole world picked problem worked together. Really? mean get stakes much lower, care less people still get it? Yeah, sure 11 year old going pay vaccine provide insurance information. idea read article. I’m glad he’s speaking lasting effects apparently 10% Covid-19 survivors experience. vaccine working much important pfizer moderna. vaccine stored normal fridge 6 months. much higher production capacity. 90% effectivity need 1.5 doses instead 2 means people get vaccine. produce 200 million doses 2020 3 billion 2021. (Way pfizer little 1 billion doses 2021). People dont seem hyped one pfizer one much bigger deal, even though little less effective. ""Social distancing"", know means? means maskless persons  Ha almost got there.

Aesop Rock another class altogether. math terms he’s imaginary axis. Well, understand science works. one finds whole article really funny? want tourism - well hit tourism spades. Welcome rest country! airlines gladly take dead people's money. disappointing?

A) vaccine effective (90%) Pfizer vaccine administered correctly 

B) it’s much cheaper produce 

C) it’s much easier transport doesn’t need stored -70degrees, crucial developing world 

D) uses adenovirus delivery vector, new therefore known safe long term. mRNA vaccine Pfizer/moderna vaccines brand new nobody knows long term affects 

E) Pfizer trial tested participants symptoms, whereas Oxford trial tested participants weekly. Seeing least 40% cases asymptomatic, Pfizer results much questionable US sells tons pork foreign countries. And, order make sure shareholders 'suffer' lower expected value, plant workers forced suffer. TEC coolers? quick glance shows get 70c ambient temperature. people this? name, there's picture dude stage mic, looks like might singing.

Let's use brains put two two together person could possibly be... prioritizing reduction sever e disease Someone counting chickens they've hatched.

Let's see happens rubber hits road. Wow, much lower case number near 50 thousand getting month ago! Great news! bashing big cities... Counter point; herd immunity 70% effectiveness 70% need 100% participation full herd immunity.  30% population sits 90% effective vaccine still 63% immunity pretty close vs 49% immunity.

Although controlling pandemic 49% immunity got lot easier controlling pandemic 5-10% immunity. would agree except deliberate attacks cutting education budgets, spreading propaganda, using trauma cycles keep people powerless positions.

Not mention politicians following propositions people vote for, billions spent corporate lobbying, general misinformation. 

Yes people need accountability to, blame equal. People might want get tested see family fly. Yes could sign influx people symptoms, also could sign people taking precautions think real ham changer. early videos hospitals overrun Italy, Spain, Latin America way scarier videos came New York last spring. HIPAA laws important, specific case think creates huge disconnect public's perception hospitals look like crisis zones, actually look like. 

People also understand difficult treating Covid patients sick time they're hospital. people think patients hooked machines hospital, think imagine patients chilling bed bunch machines them, sit like without constant attention medical staff. Like might seen relatives visited hospital precovid who'd hooked machines. covid patients like, all. Treating incredibly demanding staff time they're ICU, they'd basically dead life support systems they're hooked to. mortality rate would lot higher pandemic happened 70 years ago fuckton people live rural areas need to

What even mean?  matter state officials? matter people taking precautions? 

Stay home people! Get groceries delivered! Go work mask up! Double mask! Get smart! know. decreasing. [LIPS TOUCHED DEVIL'S VEIL SHALL TOUCH assuredly. I’m fairly certain popular models getting regularly tested parties tested planning make film. Complaining COVID buying meat factory farms hypocritical. I’ll listen Fauci. much this. Watching two Ardern Collins prime ministerial debates October perhaps pleasant political experience wife fall. wonderful thing progressive government trustworthy leadership. Go New Zealand. Hope learn them, pandemic. Weakness part human. would never expect anything less. vaccines usually 10-year trials

But it’d preposterous wait 10 years context disease. No. no. chance would take vaccine first 3 months lol, dont want Laboratory mouse vaccine hitting nice drink almost year, almost bottles hard cider.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Healthcare professionals aren’t saying “fuck you!” patients don’t enough beds for...  Oh yea, get wrong. whole, vaccine news getting *far* better expectations.

I live US, doubt I'll get Oxford vaccine end. average 70% still good, especially vaccine cheap easy mass produce, cold storage problems others.

The Oxford vaccine going save many, many lives, period. Individual liberty murder others? Yeah right.

Qantas airline, central government administrating social credit system, get blind high horse already. Another 20,000 coming every day (we like are)

The jokes write it’s brainer take anyway continue allow Covid ravage society. Yeah 60% already say take vaccine even FDA approved. It'll April vaccine even available general population, number going lot higher. people willing get vaccinated, want little time sure safe.

Also vaccinated summer (and US, countries different) chose to, couldn't. surprise sure selfishness. fact think **remotely acceptable** extend lockdowns we've eradicated COVID. already highly controversial trying implement restrictions 2000 people dying every day. want extend lockdowns COVID deaths literally undetectable background noise, one selfish, 330M people told put lives hold rightfully refuse. “Employees either genuinely held religious objection [...] receive reasonable accommodation”: long pastafarians include new religious rule vaccination new religion created “just” get vaccine exemption (similar church universal suffrage created)
Special casing laws based religion weird... Thanks! makes sense agree you, triaging different refusing care. individual liberty live life see fit better business owner chooses operate business according personal beliefs? enough folks disagree said business's ideals business fail, right? could easily say cities going also self inflicted. won’t.

Selfish people selfish ANYWHERE hurt everyone - whether you’re city country.  

It’s selfish people county perfect goodie two shoes cities. definitely top 5% something people empathy fantasize they're justice rampage comes actually denying someone care one actually wants implemented.

I view comments lens frustration sociopathic actions congregating large groups without wearing mask seem bear significant consequences it. also meant medical professionals area hit could fly areas hit. everywhere surging time nobody come help Oh neat, heard that. 

Can used treat disease, kind thing people treated Crohn's end getting sick?

Either way good news, imagine Crohn's would huge risk factor otherwise. There's major difference 100%, hundreds jackasses packing bar without masks Totally agree...but mindset directly cause thousands others die permanent issues get treatment. imagine getting hit drunk driver crippled life hospital room you, fucking COVID deniers took precautions disease? COVID partially, people, preventable wearing masks, staying home, distancing. Part wants say *choose prevent it* made choice get treatment either. I'm saying right, *definitely* right deny people care bunch idiots wear masks.

In midwest there's people literally using dying breath say COVID real.

All say careful get badly injured right now. many places right get severely injured turned away every bed full COVID patients. Fearmongering? like lotto winner thinking offer financial advice rich Especially WH. TL/DR: ""‘They’ve following science’:"" much hate republicans love hate fucked thing rural America continuously votes for, never forget democrats responsible absolute vile healthcare system. They're bored something guess. Step one: small relatively isolated country population isn’t aggressively stupid unique, original, high quality comment.

Redditors think express memes. fucking sad. 1st world yes. 3rd world no.  Totally agree.

But forget getting caught without mask pubic mindset.

It's getting caught taking unnecessary risks risking public large.

And way see would rewarding wearing masks consistently ahead triage que.  Joe gone called dead children child actors? Like really,

Is... bar now? Rodarmel, chief nurse Research Medical Center Kansas City, Missouri, said sure much longer go like 61-year-old loved job 42 years nurse. now, said, relentless influx COVID-19 patients deluged wards worried hospital system collapse, staff along due burnout contracting virus themselves. Meanwhile, outside hospital, many fellow residents refuse wear mask otherwise protect communities virus, driving infection rates ever higher. hospitals say fuck people rural areas who've taken seriously  Here's video PHX probably get LASIK occasionally work self paranoia would happen lost glasses situation replace (like remote location something) agree, honestly important point can't! Tens thousands people, minimum taken us, probably millions us. I'm right smack middle St Paul, actually. work Minneapolis. went get tested (this 3 weeks ago now), ton testing places taking new clients (which IMO fucking crazy pandemic people need testing), appointments completely full, required physician's referral get tested. place found would accept even though showing symptoms HCMC. proceeded lose sample. Lol. Clusterfuck.

I guess maybe landscape changed since then. RIGHT afterward talked lots free saliva testing locations kits. Bad timing part, guess. I'm sure relevant urban/rural divide know people communities already seen lot unnecessary unexpected deaths tragedies others. example, two co-workers high school, one lived wealthy suburban community one lived resources urban center. first one never known anyone high school died, second one lost 17 classmates. 

I sure lot death danger affecting people around would change way see it. COVID, lot us lost basic expectation daily safety, us never that. guess would follow there's reason change behavior then. What? Who's? vaccine 90% effective. large group people still thousands cases deaths people get vaccine. knows they'll do. I'll care much care transmittable illnesses. 

If catch it, that's shitty. mean need rewrite rules society make sure one ever catches again. would much room activities First Class... Yes, read FAQ Wallstreet Journal written lawyer said employers *require* vaccination. don’t think employers will, think see fair amount advantages given vaccinated.  next pandemic, could less 100 years since global commerce rising standard living accelerated likely hood. reminder, wishing harm onto anyone celebrating result ban. includes saying deserve it, abandoned, etc. *this reminds MURDERED store* self inflicted. want hurt everyone else too. stormed state houses guns, shot retail workers asking mask up. never ends. Yeah, I'm going hate people getting tested holidays. think lot people assume definitive, therefore going reliable, is.  Wow Mississippi West Virginia leading list surprises me. Thanks, TIL realize vaccine widespread, employers start mandating *is not* rights infringement.

I hate restrictions much anyone people like refusing vaccine make last longer.

I understand weary vaccine either vax restrictions. Well, dealing with, managing personal problems employees may effect ability work *absolutely* part job. fact, would say managing morale readiness team one important parts leader's job.

Also, point out: remarkable pivot excusing lack empathy bosses, immediately accusing lacking empathy. driving point home dude. people denying covid-19's existence lay literal death bed, actually dying covid-19. 

the cognitive dissonance real.  Sad, especially happened chris delia. Havent followed since then. Absolutely fucking joke.

Just put perspective, looked numbers resident state Arkansas. southern, rural state pretty dang spread total population estimated break 3million 2020s.

So 2.96 million people, *2,357* deaths. Again, large majority population [redacted], [redacted], uneducated Neanderthals. education standard one lowest entire country fifty states.

God, truly disgusting think about. doomed, many know pa going tests. No, it’s okay gloat people fucking dying pre-conceived notion think believe. (Shocking know) wind losing $300 time work, possibly spend night two jail, finally agree weekly payment plan ultimately costs $60. Never heard that.

Not sure honest. Think flipped Covid politicized.

Issues flip political parties time.

Republicans started party civil rights well.

The party lines seem totally incoherent me. issues don’t belong one side another. Covid different. Sweden, far right party roots Neo-nazi movement pro-lockdown. 

Seems tribalism coherent ideology. people really believe hospitals empty hoax. It’s disturbing.  A. experience similar virus 2002

B. never much money, urgency cooperation dedicated developing vaccine

C. Different phase trials overlaped, reducing time testing. can't breath! much carbon dioxide!  /s Yeppers. almost like pandemic response sabotaged purpose, cronyism. think Brownie heckuva job type situation though.

Frankly, institutions need re-earn trust. absolutely deserve right now. work re-earn trust, they've undermined useful.

And what's prevent MechaTrump taking office 2028 exact thing? Well, we've got radiologist running federal covid task force...so apparently anything possible field radiology solution too: maximum test capacity. (They didn’t prepare well since calculates would bo second wave herd immunity) ones tested ones ill/risk groups many areas.

Expect daily cases flat/dropping, hospital admissions deaths soar. x% effective mean context? x% recipients get sick? 100% recipients get sick x% less sick? x% recipients produce antibodies may may get sick? support jailing people unprotected sex? Alright.  vaccine results light end tunnel.

clearly level isolation sustainable years, needs sustainable months now. France recent survey found 54% would get vaccinated Since vast majority people anything sniffles, really notice much going on, except elderly people dying.

We get see theory tested next weeks. I'm pretty sure we'll notice it. I'm still planning looking work outside restaurant industry second truly open back normal expect everyone masked anymore. want since closed space people eating without masks option moment seems seasonal grocery warehouse work since know there's pandemic. That’s going stop getting vaccine  Trump gonna like: NEED PUNISH COMMUNIST LIBERAL GLOBALIST NEW ZEALAND SUPPORTING FAKE PRESIDENT ELECT BIDEN  u studied ur whole life physician ur dealing patients u choice friend. lets real here. Yup....just till Holidays. *Big sigh* proudly capitalistic society I’m perpetually amazed continually want outcome ability return normal completely divorced effort actions part. 

We assume pain prolonged half measures crappy public buyin means place took painful punctuated whole measures. general public really doesn’t know science works, even long take papers published. general public doesn’t really know figure source credible (ie. lot misinformation spread). way! So: bad conditions have, likely bad happen health. ""Told lock down"" funny way saying forced welded homes. sick could thrown camps Uyghurs. called people outliers. want know definition outlier is. far know president biden pleading people wear masks follow guidelines health safety experts. 70+ million people said, ""nah, I'm okay guy tried run bus road Im okay handling pandemic right now."" 70+ million outliers. flu vaccine mandate semester. would beyond insane covid vaccine mandate. ...and everyone wants cancel everything. commenting say God's work appreciate perseverance correcting misconceptions. Thank keep up. Selfish people, think :/ risks vaccine minuscule best 

Except know yet. long time especially NRA vaccines.  make past years....just saying. Exactly. People ridiculous. basically dollar store vaccine. Perhaps glass would better option. well... good thing condom, 30% ""fails"" immune, 70% virus eventually dies greatest world! many hats? Honest question, “many” ? don’t really see people saying it’s hoax. 

Downplaying severity, yes - really don’t see people calling hoax Ridiculous. People state don’t care, going lives though nothing going on. much bloodwork complete follow up? agree, suspect social anxiety/introverted crowd somewhat enjoying avoid social interactions easily, effective vaccines mean world returns level normalcy sooner later ant means they’ll back feeling social stress anxiety around people work recreation. Always good get confirmation suppose. disagree. Tofi's skinny fats. Especially men. think one important measurements metabolic syndrome health men waist circumference? 
The healthiest men waist circumferences around 80cm maximum. clear cut-off around 100. 
I seen plenty people like Jeremih, facial features, really bad metabolic health markers. 
There's barely anyone 6 pack abs visceral fat take extreme cases (bodybuilders, strongmen). 
That's reason south-east asians normal BMI, look skinny shit loads visceral fat. puffy fat cheeks well.  Joe Rogan right! no. onion often funny entertaining. Since places really started hammering home ""no exhale valve masks"" - supply kind respirators come back. 

Supply 3m cartridges never really ever stopped. Medical professionals buying quite work decontamination procedures...and bulky. 

I buy ANYTHING respiratory related amazon. chance counterfeit DAMN HIGH. mask itself...fine...but carts get grainger, mcmaster carr, reputable suppliers. saying shouldnt care people?

Only purposefully choose harm themselves. empathy people. save try better world, burn ground. people dont choice yes matters.

Who choice? said health care works far, absolutely choice. Multiple choices, fact. Yeah leadership fuelled divide. sounds like happy things laugh face country offered expertise bringing people together upcoming president who's (hopefully) going try heal divide? options there? wait certain number positive cases draw conclusions efficacy vaccine, drawing conclusions subset cases A-OK?

Seems like they're playing little fast &amp; loose rules. work math backwards 131 total positive cases reported...and looks like difference 60% 90% efficacy reading half first-dose group could little 4 5 cases.

They need lot data convince lower-dose group really 90% effective. Nah. straw man/ad hominem type thing. actual, existing standards health care triage. difficult question. wouldn’t say accepting educated around science - Murdoch way we’d track USA 2.0. Still got rednecks around parroting trumpisms whinging masks. likening Dan Andrews dictator ripping Steven Marshall all. fave adelaideans celebrating made hard lockdown literally 3 days lol 90% efficacy rate vaccine mean 10% dies, means 90% immune virus first place. apply 0,66% mortalitly rate 10%, get virus, even would severe vaccine helps immune system fight. rly good points glad u brought up. know used extreme examples. However ur saying flu vaccine well studied even though changes every year. working sars early 2000's lot research ground work covid-19 vaccine. somewhat well studied ur gonna go there. 6x undercounted globally: undercounted US: math. watched Cuomo's press conference today, mentioned April starting low risk vaccination 70% June July?

Also, I'd vote man ran President. everywhere.  virus could kill you. ICU beds city nearly full. means assholes like packing airports week make treating car crashes, heart attacks, strokes, things ICU normally handles far deadly. Today again, Italy's death toll 630, 3,465 US equivalent deaths, 3091 yesterday, 3806 day before--I know Italy's death rate continues highest Europe Hostility idea support, just.... American. 

FTFY religious state, must appeal secular organization try avoid dying. that’s true. History shows that, often, civilization imposed wishes unwashed masses. Military service, Public schooling, Taxes, yes, public health measures like vaccines. shame. Publix let employees protect themselves. hope so!!! 15,000 delayed? even spread week.... yeah, I'm little worried vaccine, time since I'm low medium priority time reaches side effects already known. Hopefully, require person *both* doses two-dose vaccine. Otherwise, might well vaccine all. Hopefully, single-dose version available point. “Some may die, that’s sacrifice I’m willing make”  I’ve taking Vitamin D3 religiously since 2011 rarely get sick. cheap possibly effective “tool” mitigate issues virus. planning stopping it? There's literally nothing encourage people stuff boost immune system (regular exercise, healthy diet, smoking/drinking etc.) fight easier end getting it.

For reason never get rid influenza common cold viruses.

1. Highly contagious, mild respiratory viruses spread fast. masks lockdowns social distancing voodoo going stop them. measures completely failed. 
2. Highly contagious, mild respiratory viruses simply extremely high number people contract either mild symptoms completely asymptomatic, allowing go unnoticed long period time. Since vast majority people anything sniffles, really notice much going on, except elderly people dying.

By time even notice virus there, already far late anything stop even could, time virus already taken hold point keep spreading herd immunity reached. Sunlight free. Right, assumptions get made. beer bar since March CCP bot typhoid mary's motivations partially financial self interest, applies directly. Idk, remember people trying pass fake medical cards medical condition wearing mask public. long someone posts ever verification vaccinated someone sells knock offs online? see happening. anyone expect differently business men invested meat industrial complex? 

Look conditions treat animals really expect care workers?

While might sanitary Upton Sinclair's time, still brutal af.


The good news become vegetarian help out. Try cutring meat consumption instead possible buy local farms farmer's markets. also incredibly safe actual airplane due way air circulated actively filtered ever 2-3 minutes.

I know personal experience anecdotal, think planes safe people saying are. many international trips per year, first couple years got sick 50% total flights (on average, got sick either traveling place it, always day two flight). number slowly came following years I'm sure started building immunities foreign infections (and started following tips reduce likelihood infections). happen domestic-only flights, reduces chance airport likely culprit. also continually sick 2-4 week stays foreign countries. thing consistently tied illnesses long, foreign flight.

I suspect residence time airplane 2-3 minutes, may help filter viruses somewhat, there's still plenty opportunity virus float around nearest passengers decently high viral dose. We'll see. hard thing study, study thus far I've seen conducted N95 masks, people wearing flights currently. here, there's incentive resturants enforce it. app QR registration, service customers. ID's anon/tokenised. Sydney, AU, state giving vouchers stimulate economy, resturants need comply COVID regulations benefit. Maybe conspiracry theorist change minds small handout. Lmao guy still mad 2-0 world wars. gonna tell communites us. That's good here. probably assumed line profession healthcare original post I'm discussion like 3 different places. Hard keep track. Lol. 

Anyway, people healthcare probably first round receiving vaccine main issue us finding reason avoid getting it. didn’t anything special. says won’t work US. quickest way convince people get famous person get vaccine. Think Elvis polio vaccine.

The problem unless Donald Trump Joe Biden get front camera national TV get vaccine, going get anywhere close 100% vaccinated. Even then, people divided told scientists idiots, choose continue live Hoax/Big Brother/Fuck Science fantasy world. Yep clarify, Moderna’s vaccine stored normal freezers long term storage normal refrigeration temps shorter periods. Pfizer requires ultra low freezers. ppl stupid? pandemic worse ever far spreading idiots cant stay home bc wanna eat fucking turkey understand Australia got rid lockdowns right? get Chinese travellers US per capita, give crap see often.

Had 18 think community cases Perth, unknown source. back April, memory bit hazy - post lockdown, single case community since.

In light thread atm Wuhan, check Perth snap maps night week believe me.

Curious going move goalposts here, I'm going assume going landborder Mexico Canada reason? People don’t usually regret something. regret getting caught. getting that? thats absurd im sorry hear that

what dont like specific thread seems grow worse hivemind every passing day

it seems like take next step past go bars anyways saying enough

they get getting believe issue people not...it'l taking next step going anyways get flack one reads article... vaccines roll **force** Spring, meaning vaccines available everyone, normal Summer possible? I’ve seen conflicting reports long would take actually get population vaccinated high enough level virus isn’t really issue american living NZ, wasn’t. Much better Drivers. California driver, didn’t even know inadequate skills living Europe. Insurance companies work hard find ways deny claims. government service agency thing. Proving person caught virus one particular location virtually impossible. know it.

""Risk life us. get sick die, screw family over.""

Heartbreaking story. exactly what's going on. parents playing cognitive dissonance games family's. 

They believe family, get infected. there's Christian Dome houses, like protection Angel Death.

A curse houses, wishing safe gathering infected, quick recovery quick death. still need studies say this? envy situation are/were in. That’s saying. feel fortunate wife able work without interruption whole year. 

Perhaps said people families ability save money should. Good luck you, hope everything works out.  unregulated capitalism good. really, drive bit outaide city buy meat small mom pops farms raise animals slaughter themselves.

I personally eat meat, step forward progress know. going start wearing everywhere. Sorry. problem can't handle truth. 🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️ Freezer space also
. Rural Americans want 2 things cities; 

1.tax dollars

2.their ICU beds

And, change, even get sick this. ""For proudly capitalistic society I’m perpetually amazed continually want outcome ability return normal completely divorced effort actions part.""

You described everyone 40.  Churchill said “you depend Americans right thing, they’ve tried everything else” fucking truth true, what's point asymptomatic people wearing masks?  Rogan heart hearts believes sauna heat shock proteins elk meat cures Covid-19. wouldn’t bother opinion. Lab mouse here, you’ll fine. Seriously, fear normal healthy, questioning healthy normal, inaction based fears worldwide pandemic situation foolish. Don’t science denier, you’re better that. people won’t get vaccine. profits. meat plant execs betting many would get Covid. hard convince people give dining fucking governor went dinner party multiple families. governors politicians caught breaking rules. Good luck convincing someone really care start caring now. antigen self-testing kits reliable? one take sample nose place fluid. tells answer 15 minutes. 

If work, get internet? Unfortunately, injury compensable, must 'arise of' sustained 'in course scope' employment. 

The injured worker must produce evidence infection occurred work, work activities. simply enough disease discriminate employed unemployed, first responders covid-deniers.

California took steps time ago amend law cover first responders acquire covid. state senator state representative not. post history suggest good handle facts surrounding COVID19. belive solidarity good thing? (healthy) wearing masks asymptomatic infections, say way less dangerous!?  flus like popping every years? Every agency tarnished reputation 2020 bending knee evil. discovered among social circles selfish pieces shit possible psychos also discovered many businesses agencies filled brim absolute cowards.

This pandemic could end 24 hours I'd still live knowing utterly pathetic world live is.

Edited adhere censorship guidelines apparently can't discuss who's blame pandemic. almost zero international travel. plenty international travels. No, flights aren’t full, there. Even country closed, still connect. flew Chicago Frankfurt three weeks ago. Wasn’t allowed enter country kept Istanbul. agree 100%, laugh little - make point people understanding exponential growth post linear growth example: 3, 6, 9. think meant 3, 6, 12... Elon Musk want hurt bottom line, go ahead throw opinion completely biased un-educated.

Look, I've rabbit hole government evil never relinquish power given. still believe honestly, ask beyond personal feeling action allows rather saying everything slippery slope.

To claim masks indoctrination communism bit much would highly suggest speak someone concerns. Genuinely, that's beyond form healthy reasoning defies logic. Seriously, tell EXACTLY CURRENT impact requiring masks would be. authority give government already have? expand power hurt population?

Now started martial law, locked everyone house, arrested comply might ground stand on.

Politicians scum, get wrong, everything preserve position money, Americans damned. mask mandate expand power, take away peoples power. nothing promote protection others. relieves stress healthcare workers. Yup - and, ZERO Vit store shelves now. empathy self destructive morons causing harm society. Neither you.

lol honestly think college students covid immunity seems long term possible buy local farms farmer's markets

A lot times they're sent slaughterhouses. help? exactly? sent Hart Island help dig mass graves. Another redditor said Pfizer trials complete, trial standard every safe currently use vaccine. reason speed paperwork expedited(for obvious reasons). one redditors 2c seems legit virus could eliminated within weeks - frequent rapid testing. vaccine developer, would try delete hide article quick possible -- that's fear, also, buried.

You try re-reading come said one should..... literally said that.

I literally not. I'd love quote said this. I'll wait.  could actually invest IRS enforce existing tax law audits. think one point every dollar invested IRS returned 4 dollars something. would generate revenue encourage actually follow law based real threat getting caught. remember Publix happened stupid enough put writing..they weren’t ones. many kids gotten kicked dorms? thinking might add mix. Great link. share reddit turn sub something else. Maybe another sub dedicated super cute animals, like minks something.  There's also questionable ethics preventing vaccination placebo group already vaccinating public. Potentially years (in case two years).  Still, unless checks two party verification code, faked. Kind like paperless insurance apps: will, way. don’t think know enough right make good call natural immunity enough, especially since virus, like coronaviruses, well-documented ability reinfect us. 

Here’s article explains Yeah but, cant get alimony without getting married first ""Sorry would rather fuckin die"" people questioning CDC also trying rationalize “drinking bleach.” aren’t people would otherwise listened CDC. happens people throwing inescapable cycle poverty businesses forced don’t exist try go back work? people’s livelihoods matter? honestly believe negative impact people’s lives another shutdown? Hello people future. someone still needs care them. said one should..... literally said that.  think ones actually ramming people rd outliers. ones choosing ignore full picture support politics lead actions not. constant ridicule people worsens thing.

But I'm going continue argue uniting population good thing, shouldnt leave millions people behind fallen victim ocean misinformation continue ridicule them. easy ignore here. Steady guess? area they’ve begging Medics EMTs start working hospitals emergency training RNs without experience. It’s different animal completely. ""We believe product never licensed US,"" investment bank SVB Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges said note Monday. ""This belief based design company’s pivotal trials (which appear match FDA’s requirements representation minorities, severe cases, previously infected individuals elderly increase risk populations), based occurrence severe safety events (why take risk) resulted extended clinical hold enrollment trials US.""

Never hell word... CDC one organizations get easily influenced outside forces yet became heavily influenced politics. understand need worry funding power dynamics go scientific consensus expect people follow suit. anyone even moderate scientific education, failures alarming reputationally damning. mutate without infecting spreading humans, ""incubate"" They're saying hospitals empty.... mean **half**istic medicine rules? I’m really excited get back life I’m pretty anxious around crowds again, sure feel first start framing Christmas 2020 test God see put everything aside alone God holiday now. easy frame covid test religious standards truly makes sense religious people ones convinced we're tyranny. even understand trials saints went through? going year without partying gathering groups kind impossible them? Perhaps actually religious like group power influence others. 1-2 punch going right now. 

The spike deff huge demand.

The demand deff people thinking ""I got tested go see mee'ma!"".... Nope, public stupid couple missteps CDC made. majority people believed Bill Gates wanted implant nanobots control minds. blame CDC. saw concert ten years ago thought sucked. Certainly wouldn’t go see pandemic. infectious diseases matter now? Hunger result corrupt governments? Weirdly simplistic worldview, classic take reddit gamer little real world experience curious comment. target groups words? dumb question take 3 vaccines? Would get 100% (or close it) hitting multiple angles? :) Don’t know that, everyone last company liberal I’m sure depends at. bootlicking leaves work them. now?

Cognitive dissonance new #1 hobby USA.  literally said article lmao. people point nuclear meltdown Jacinda. might want unknot panties think fact may reaching far. Also, one forcing live here. fuck back Murica find appealing. totally misinterpreted comment. don’t card. Well guess somewhere haven’t seen 4 years. government issued ID number. give airline check personal information government database stamp tag boarding pass. lets TSA know go decreased screening. manage it, airlines. 

The United States already multiple systems tracking various security programs. would difficult tack vaccine tracking onto it. US it, rest developed world.  GP medical center at. Maybe it’s state thing. I’m WA, Seattle area. pretty good medical care access locally here, compared parts WA US. definitely understand perspective. hope take solace fact I’ll getting vaccinated soon I’m able to. Unlike lot people fully trust mRNA vaccines safe. vaccine developer, would try delete hide article quick possible -- that's fear, also, buried.

You tinfoil hattist. article posted university press release, course would tout researcher's breakthrough way past point realism. still need vaccines. would great get rapid tests people's hands, make big impact claimed, would require large investment congress huge push White House. see happening point? Maybe next administration could consider among many mitigation efforts. would big logistical hurdles -- people good interpreting acting unreliable results like tests would create.

Honestly that’s perspective insider, Every 60 seconds, 1 minute passes hot bartender knew exactly doing! Oh give kids covid vaccine went 25 person gathering me, wife, two kids, mom, mom dad. 

I’m still nervous too. 7 people. mom surgery consult today (she fractured arm two stops last week) I'm worried she'll pick up. immunosuppressants. sister's boyfriend's dad went hospital heart procedure got sick passed away COVID last night. sister autoimmune blood disorder causes blood clots way COVID works retail pharmacy tech. people trying tried best avoid enough. I'm pretty sure that's saying results show vaccine significantly effective virus, regardless dose. point *real* efficacy value might 90%, they'll confirm study people. admit lazy read study, doable posting lots tests.

Coronavirus politicized US far enter-twined politics.

Its fact one party US exacerbated pandemic dont pretend didnt. I'm guessing follow 14 days. Absolutely. grew middle class US, lived Vietnam Italy. Vietnam, saw levels poverty can't even compare US. Even Italy, people earn far less US, least worry healthcare here. many causes this, like: 


\- older average population. 
\- tradition greeting everybody everytime, especially phisically. 
\- tradition sons daughters living family longer. 
\- tradition keeping older parents close, usually house. 
\- fucked NHS plagued years budget cuts. subsequent lack personnel second wave. 
\- first wave populated densely packed areas north region. 
\- first wave hit like train concentrated area, NHS got overwhelmed first period many deaths unreported. think 20.000 excess death respect previous year, added official count. 
\- test much start. 900 deaths 6.000 new cases seemed lot, high mortality rate. 25.000 tests, 250.000 like today.

I'm disagreeing here, advice fine. point actually help. know combat virus, refuse it.

I don’t think anyone enjoying pandemic, even they’ve managed make it. think people skeptical vaccine 1: don’t know vaccines work 2: it’s sudden. 

I’m trying bash personally, I’m pointing way person views pandemic going vary wildly based personal experiences.  Yes, that's get booster shot. Otherwise 70% effective. Uhhh lol there’s anyone knows defeat covid it’s NZ. less 2k total cases went 100 days without new cases. i’m guessing JA offering help knows Biden cares covid, unlike Trump Right, Imperial Germany exactly individualist country comparatively western countries.

I think lot gray areas everyone capable staying in, working home, ordering delivery items. everyone mindful, screaming streets spitting people planes, we’d lot better off. else going doctor nurse?

True asymptomatic people refer people stay asymptomatic entire infection. often know infected antibody test weeks later. I'm familiar terminology, mean 1 million difference year last year comparable dates? less? also poured dirt streets people drive cities. harsh worked.

Nah really: authoritarian countries handled 1918 flu better individualistic countries.......yet individualistic countries decided 20th century. might explained said correctly. 

When referenced “red tape” talking paperwork processed immediately, manner would before, instead waiting 6-months pick pile paper start started immediately. 

The “red tape” context simply someone hurry job (or jobs took precedent) anything done quickly task actually completed.

If CDC employee gets 50 vaccines process would go top list, bottom. it’s faster sense took less time get us vaccine vaccine, faster sense skipped steps. wish could agree first paragraph, 737 MAX, I'm really leery government agencies cutting corners noted half assed quarantine got VIC trouble first place. states accepted military police help, VIC hiring security staff fucking WhatsApp phishing messages. QLD stock piling PPE use workers, even quarantine workers got fresh masks medi-hotels VIC, aged care homes.

On top that? thing happened Adelaide regards too.... people worked quarantine system allowed go work elsewhere, without getting tested, work isn’t secure enough states.

This troubling legal precedents would set expand. minors suddenly give informed consent this, medical procedures? activities?

And reverse? children personal authority consent, authority refuse? refuse medical procedures too?

If child's consent always subject doctor's approval, child's consent anyway - doctor's consent gained legal authority parents.

I hope everyone get vaccinated, trust lawmakers think bills like one through. dropped this:  /s 2000+ people died day. That's bad peak pandemic March/April sucks. know people care others, half time feels like you’re one you’re can. people weren’t selfish, wouldn’t numbers nearly high now.

Even outside pandemic... it’s saddening. need sort qualification opinion feel safe take vaccine? Come dickhead. answer question it'll probably month first becomes available. shit hits fan then, I'll get it. Anybody required work f2f right deserves hazard pay, imo. lot testing done, sadly. Due spread virus fought developers got lot data control groups got sick. I’m tryna manage expectations here, much like federal government tell us ANYTHING. 

Way see it, US says normal comes April/May, see us Canada starting vaccinations month later therefore getting normal month later, also factor US priority customer may get doses quicker. 

On contrary, Canada much acceptant population vaccines (close 80% saying they’ll take COVID vaccine soon it’s available) we’ll probably lower burden disease normal May reached quicker vaccinations. It’s tough thing predict I’m tryna keep expectations check. family asking 30k cover costs related passing.

And likely win nearly impossible family prove loved one caught virus Publix. 

And please shoot one. fact COVID-related lawsuit going difficult win based circumstantial everything is. difference back days wages cost living much better, you’d total skid-row drunk level poverty often see nowadays even everything right. Wait, stats safety vaccines? expect like half year last trial phase Immunity effects. estimated 30% ND SD infected. Rate transmission (R0) decreases people become infected. 

Hospitalizations cases leveled bit ND despite consistently increasing testing capacity. deep abiding appreciation pussies really like comparison.

This history. deny good things life needlessly? U.S. government start distributing Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc’s newly authorized COVID-19 antibody combination Tuesday, beginning 30,000 treatment courses, health official said Monday.

U.S. officials call reporters said doses allocated based states highest numbers confirmed cases hospitalizations, currently soaring nationwide.

The U.S. Food Drug Administration Saturday issued emergency use authorization treatment called REGN-COV2, combines two monoclonal antibodies, used mild-to-moderate COVID-19 adults children high risk progressing severe COVID-19.

Regeneron said expects enough REGEN-COV2 80,000 patients end month. expects enough doses treat 200,000 patients first week January, rising 300,000 patients total end January.

The antibody cocktail among treatments given U.S. President Trump bout COVID-19 last month. declared virtual “cure” COVID-19 time.

The treatment belongs class biotech drugs known monoclonal antibodies, manufactured copies antibodies created human body fight infections.

U.S. regulators earlier month authorized another antibody treatment COVID-19 Eli Lilly Co. Officials Monday said department Health Human Services already helped distribute 120,000 doses Lilly’s antibody patients around country.

More 250,000 Americans also treated COVID-19 antibody-rich convalescent plasma recovered patients, officials said. health experts argued enough data show convalescent plasma effective treatment. Americans love individualism point fucking smooth brained dickhead replying gets exist. live Canada people care others enough social distance, wear face coverings, give parties, okay get damn pandemic with. look number cases per country see much ""every man himself"" mentality gets them. Every day find another reason never go back America, fucking idiot today's reason. I'm sorry talk him. ""unwashed masses"" (lol) really want something, pretty hard make happen without going full totalitarian. *can* find things like Tiananmen Square Stalin's Russia aspirational military side, like said, country concept civil rights gonna really tough time it.  anything, way around, seems increase crime, New York, big cities, year virus one factors causing increase. Houston, we've seen 44% increase murders last year. Besides $150k spare get treatment Republicans voted make illegal. possible around someone virus contract virus yourself? gonna miss, honest. is, unfortunately, misinterpretation. infection purposes trial PCR positive symptomatic infection, data regarding asymptomatic infections. mean? Americans probably huff copium high flow oxygen point pandemic.  Insane delusional people also among educated people. called crackpot. graphs site show deaths going data old goes September. Daily deaths LAGGING INDICATOR. wait 4 weeks deaths start going -- NOW. like June sun belt states (FL, TX, AZ) began large increase cases, 4 weeks Fox News pundits shouting nobody dying Covid anymore disease, shut pretend never said that, deaths caught many people indeed die regions. You... know hardly anyone lives country, right? Yep, dry ice shippers allow Pfizer vaccine stay cold enough 15 days. 

Even worst case Pfizer's vaccine goes dense urban areas closer access high end freezers Moderna/AstraZeneca goes rural areas. Except time government sends checks inflates money supply pay them. punishes get reducing relative net worth Why? isn’t following 100 percent time doesn’t mean won’t. say, ""big Thanksgiving dinners lead small Christmas funerals."" chucklefucks think it'll apply them, course. people arriving California states countries, including returning California residents, self-quarantine 14 days arrival limit interactions immediate household. 

Do call travel restrictions? way! aha rewatched Stand April due COVID. I'd definitely watch remake! ""Common sense"" merely used calling someone else stupid, days. Probably helps able lockdown pay everyone stay home. till Holidays.

I dunno....I'm stoked. got back grocery, liquor, pot store. probably Thanksgiving get host (and gal pal) I'm sure I'll back visit folks next year, long make it. 

I'm going miss family, I'm family, miss beer, football, creative control cooking.

Inb4 ""Singapore free press!!!1!1!?!!1?!"" comments flood comment section mean horribly mismanaged right?

You got right. years ago, highschool went spent $200k new scoreboard football field. time administration announced that, teachers posting Facebook begging people donate basic supplies like pencils paper.

When criticized it, administration said new scoreboard planned years budget change it. course could, want to.

Schools municipal operations shitty financial planning philosophy ""if spend budget, lose it"". years lot property tax income, get higher budgets plan spend all. sometimes even borrow form bonds. economy takes shit property values drop tax income decreases, end fire teachers increase class sizes can't afford pay spent spare money dumb shit like giant new swimming pool ridiculously stupid scoreboard shitty football team never even placed top 5 division. There’s even term now, “caution fatigue”. It’s natural reaction prolonged stress leaves feeling worn less motivated adhere safety guidelines. Oh, 100% agree. Well let's keep Western countries. US UK stronger economic growth Nazi Germany example Nazi Germany used massive rearmament means economic recovery following Great Depression (which illusory sustainable). pretty facetious compare USSR example undergoing massive industrialisation catch West Stalin. Mass released tentative plan month ago. short, goes healthcare workers vulnerable populations including seniors essential workers everyone else. really hope passes. Kids antivax moms/dads able get protection hit 18 curfew Paris lockdown hugely ineffective IMHO. Many bars restaurants closed all. lead rush evening still open.

Anyway data clearly indicating drop important statistics. sure government decide bars restaurants lockdown. Nope.

 

I feel like I'd get bored obviously wrong time, people different, guess. Go source, luke. neighbors kids state soccer tournament past weekend. mind blown even held. Let’s bring kids families multiple states together weekend, send home. don’t words anymore. Americans love freedom individual rights, fight hard protect them. 9/11 gave interest national security new powers abused.

In instance refusing forced wear masks, stay home, close thier businesses etc... foolish lead nothing death. instinct protect personal rights admired many us countries long time.

It also important realise many Americans necessary strict lockdown cause incredible financial hardship. Idk haven’t seen toilet paper CA 3 different grocery stores Thursday now. get states wait open til $600/week expired. Let people whine haircuts eating out, long people getting paid stay home, get state govt's take advantage it. likely general public access vaccine summer 

Yep, although hopefully early summer.  Look article dated. guy made look like fool almost instantly, couldn’t predictable rise infection accompanies cold weather. 

First, claim half almost positive PCR tests false positives isn’t backed sort evidence I’m aware of. Second, even he’s claims true, reason believe so, wouldn’t explain significant rise hospitalizations death accompanied exponential growth. 

Moral story. want see conspiracy search find way justify it. careful get info. [Deaths per million vs concern, look cases per million soft, prior generations go war many americans get killed. Give death INSTEAD liberty! Well paid people stay home might work. Feels relevant: I've twice now, I'll take double amount sir! barely go outside work days, I'm horribly lonely barely seeing anyone anymore outside immediate supervisor go field week lately. 


Seen three friends four times two months. live cat guinea pigs. temptation blow things even chance strange problems 3 months later real agree fucking terrible narrative? american living NZ

Lol like fuck are. How's Maryland time year anyway? That, people free leave trial whenever want whatever reason, vaccines start getting widespread rollout, imagine whole lot people placebo arm nope get vaccinated vaccine nature exposes body enough disease builds immunity. immunity, virus immediately killed unable replicate large numbers spread others. That’s basics believe, I’ve never heard people spreading diseases vaccinated against. NZ. Level 4 travel banned, could use car go supermarket doctor/pharmacy. Level 3 banned cross regional boundaries Auckland alone Level 3 Army brought seal Auckland city boundary roadblocks. yes, 2016 Trump Dec. movie trailer felt unervingly possible. put pic perspective though, taken March mask wearing widely adopted even discouraged Fauci.

Regardless, allowing people bunch like incredibly irresponsible. Won’t matter Thanksgiving send numbers roof again.  Ah explains China committing genocide..... that, filling hospitals covid-19 patients burden hospitals point choose patients choose ones best odds...so get accidents, make sure spouse refrains beating close death remember, unwillingness stop spread means cannot heart attack anytime soon. Good luck. Yeah keep saying everyone different opinion. Lol, one cares think... we've outpouring praises real world leaders, cant say thing country we, sweetie.. 😂 don’t know made laugh hard. boyfriend family migrating grandparents' Florida, different places, I'm really pissed it. course gave 'my family going really hard time need this' spiel, are, damn, many people are. get old ass grandparents sick(er)? I'm super sympathetic family problems hate he's going shit, everyone thinks they're exceptional 'need' more, infuriating. one second think 'maybe best right now,' family *so* special deserves together right ""Let's plan party even though us already Covid! LOL"" We've found traveling airplanes unsafe previously believed. Millions people world fly every single day. corona linked cases airports substantial. 

There's perpetuated paranoid myth sub flying fastest way catch corona meanwhile people fly constantly business. airport related Corona would crazy.. not. job listen experts every day living. fuck someone else's life ""critical thinker"" who, scientist, misinterprets information come bullshit conclusion fucking proteins bound particular way. Sounds good me! There’s suggestions certain vitamins/supplements MIGHT help, nothing definitive. start entire email thing clinton? clarify mean “fear index” non scientific know, level fear least US opinion peaked March declining ever since. 

The actual numbers really aren’t related it. someone explain like I'm dumb (because am). EUA? Approval I'm guessing? 

Also, saying doubt particular vaccine ever get approved. expect vaccines get approved? 

Do still think things back normal spring/summer? know number put Known Traveler Number pre-check mine &amp; valid? may know exact details yet, countries require doctors report centralized database patients receive sort identifier tie back it. Sure people could fake enough decrease effectiveness policy Cities want two things Rural Americans.  Food silence. Here's thing. human brain wired feel like nothing always less risky faced two options...it isn't. risk harm vaccine. risk harm virus. risk harm virus greater. wish could bring scale whatever New Zealand. Please don’t mad question ignorant- know vaccine safe little time? Long term effects etc surely couldn’t studied thus far? similar vaccines market protects covid instead flu, etc?  I’m sure take meaning. anyone seen officer lately? I’m betting governor almighty pissed. Union leadership, worth shit, would dropping hints management no-strike clause going actually prevent strike conditions unsafe. Right, kind stated point fall leaders, falls country. JA done offer Biden team guidance. work, still fuck tonne better what's going year.  Well 4 month lockdown mandatory masks certainly worked treat. friends....you bow one.  nine months now. long takes pump another child. know now. countries comparing chilling meant longer job interruption losing waay jobs. Collective failure, also brutal failure federal govt manage situation make likely people would comply.  “The Vaccines Children (VFC) program federally funded program provides vaccines cost children might otherwise vaccinated inability think potential authorize orders, originally uniformed Public Health Service Commissioned Corps would actual enforcers. PHSCC, command Surgeon General, actually go heavy handed San Francisco early 20th century subsequently lost enforcement power abused racial prejudice razing entire immigrant neighborhoods. actually really surprised Trump jump chance exploit racist history again. shame, think modern reforms might put enforcement good use, FBI done reforming racist prejudice professional integrity. way not? called critical thinking first time see friend person I’m going bawl like baby benefits receive?

I’d least expect insurance cover part.

Can somebody explain state benefits they’re applied average state worker? Great job Fauci, saved Christmas! Wait... what's that? Oh cancelled it. Fantastic work, I'm sure kids happy. Sweden currently experiencing third least deadly year history. 2017/18 deadlier 2020 - data sourced end year, death tally look completely normal indistinguishable recent year. ""denier narratives"", mean facts, plenty go around. Well gotta applaud consistency.

Consistent absolute human garbage.... act like money F sake.... ASU students remote..most students looking even seen campus semester cutting professors. didn’t say bad. support skepticism. merely making point it’s anti-vaxers skip getting vaccinated. Oh, flatten curve?

It's easily preventable, given spread despite restrictions. sources? Figured much.  believe vacation December 10th anyhow. it’s keeping people safe safer, right. Good counter-argument 👏 totally get point now/s numbers beyond grasp now. stay away.  Vietnam 50k Americans died. 40k traffic fatalities year numbers offer perspective me. continue mask exposure recommendations. honestly, might worth faking symptoms close date. assuming takes get test, might enough convince everyone call off.

good luck business model work anymore. make shift e-commerce chance.

Iconic? represent todays Canada. hear see Hudson Bay think Colonizing murderers. Honestly would agree actions affected yourself, doesn't. attending gathering catching COVID affect many people yourself. encouraging considering wife nurse large, North Texas hospital. far expecting 6 million doses [january Pfizer Moderna. That's 3 million people. 

I hope there's us pipeline, many countries I'm sure.

Canada signed deals Moderna, Pfizer, Novavax, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Sanofi GlaxoSmithKline. wall

Hahaha, indeed brand!

But name brand ""haval"" English. obscenely disgraceful, it? Oh my, literal snowflake wild Sure. propose rioting lawlessness good way stop covid, right? I'd imagine it'll initial elation, followed kinda mass (although rolling depending location) depression. economically anything, slowly people things they've wanted almost year now, wondering ""Okay, what?"" Like mass disappointment, realize that, sure, wanted go restaurants concerts bars sporting events, have, problems magically cured.

Still better shit, though. 😥 talking nurse friend phone couple hours ago. absolutely exhausted, pulling 16 hour shifts months now. worried her...I imagine lots front line workers used up. also able get disability green card holder. sponsor needs make enough income support you. doesn't, need joint sponsor agree support become citizen. saying get Inheritance Christmas gift?!? Can't wait! It’s done patents too. Executive branch CYA long remember pack coin Charon. Yes, die economy, nothing next kin!! 

Are really still this? Anecdotal evidence: relatively fit prior contracting Covid July: weight-training two-to-three times per week last decade occasional aerobic training.

After majority symptoms dissipated, still took two months recover 90% lung capacity (I still feel way back). first week difficulty cutting yard using walk-behind mower.

I took slow I'm back able bike swim times per week, process. law unjust? also ""they're jobs"" terrible argument. people usually say Nazi soldiers also jobs response that, fair point. job demands behave way inhumane, keep following orders, quit fucking job try bring justice people allow happen. job excuse committing atrocities. FIRE RISES BROTHER weird they're lumping prison guards first responders? Poe’s Law strikes lol  America fucked every single thing step done single thing right?

America screwed logistics Covid tests PPE back March. screw up. America simply incapable things right.

Have even prepared plan? seem like explained anything they'll ship millions 2 weeks. Sounds like nonsense heard early March millions tests ready next week. happen. US still provides false ones? think pandemic shown us governments aren’t different others. Chinese government power citizens. thought guys want Trump power? one it? still eat indoors.  tent outside restaurant. 

But worry... blend right in. I'm sorry, apologize, thought moment speaking something trolling caricature. Yes, successful France, Italy, Spain, UK...oh wait, they're new surges right now. Riots? Come man. Fauci reminds people exercise take Vitamin everyday might well fear-mongerer. never tells people anything proactive improve health, do. Thanks yous never enough. Apparently job market tight Florida DeSantis go way Ohio find sports blogger / Uber driver anyalize Covid-19 stats him. We're find would happened China lock Wuhan Chinese New Year. known write it, bragged pro business Delaware.  I'm guessing assuming Americans actually going get vaccine? Maybe doesnt way, ya know? Instead jaded, cherish moments like state Georgia told trump go fuck himself. gop eventually destroy splitting even fractious parties lose even power, knows? Go Bucks! leader. fault refuse recognize it. Oh well. net effect, no? falsify data. fun once... want survive apocalypse without eat someone know... I’m tired fucking people. Britain walking compromise line economy contagion. 

What get mass deaths plus bad economy people scared shop girlfriend REALLY quiet Thanksgiving family. I'm gearing argument. It’s poorly worded. buying vaccines five different companies, five vaccine doses dealing something contagious, everything right still end getting it. take recommended precautions - masks, hand washing/sanitizer, distancing, going unless necessary, forth. live three people. Two jobs can't done fully home. Hell, one works school. safe are, safe around are.

Precautions reduce risk getting infected. 100% eliminate it. disease like this, impacted lot habits people around you. can't control them. control yourself, much. certain point stronger peer pressure. believe one republicans time governor tried put things place (mandatory masking, add bars places essential businesses April stay home mandate) put lawsuits stop happening. I'm starting think fed literally CANT another stimulus check. matter want dont, literally one tried. Perfect way break nation, get conspirital. mean, enough people bgg working / spending, government would eventually stop making money too. Maybe much damage done theres enough funds go around.

 Perfect opportunity someone bring boats get ideas staying longer visit. (Wether started not) I'm sorry, facts trigger you? Avoid crowds protest herderherr

You dumb Americans fault pandemic, anyone else citizens U.S.A. disease Canada. less stupid people like  literally doctors health officials saying ROOM even you’re sick Covid. understand ? beds hospitals. 

What earth points matter ? name kindergarten is
""Child's Heart Little Yale Preschool""
The following descriptions searched kindergartens

Tianjin Children's Heart Little Yale Kindergarten established 2011, seven years development, high-end kindergarten three campuses. total construction area 5,000 square meters, 200 children kindergarten, teaching staff 60 people, large-scale kindergarten.

From inception, Little Yale Kindergarten introduced top international education system - Montessori education system, cooperated international Montessori educational institutions build kindergartens Development Zone Tanggu circle Montessori kindergartens, University Science Technology kindergarten advanced Montessori classes. University Science Technology Kindergarten advanced Montessori classes. formed integrated Montessori education system 0-6 years old, providing best quality early childhood education. used lot words actually say damn thing. time unveil mission accomplished banners Fuck Carson Trump Jr. dozens celebrities received tons media coverage COVID diagnosis. yup Yeah, bullshit. Plenty footage people w/ masks. Sharing bottles champagne. gives fuck, right, wanna fun. Lots facilities/hospitals around country telling front-line clinicians “If following proper procedures, really way catch covid work. patient must mask, must you.” Despite changing guidelines every week, burnout. Despite usual federal regulators MIA (all year!) terms speaking direct 180 we’ve taken standards safety, providing leadership provoking others action. (Not go rant,) patients don’t/won’t wear, lose flimsy masks given; staff reusing masks point smell concentrated bad breath ~36 hours, longer fit tightly hours, etc.,. That’s mention lack basic ppe STILL many places. census went laid long-time employees lot institutional knowledge, already shit hit fan numerous ways. lengths person go to, make profit. hope every fraudulent “small” business took money didn’t need year pays price. I'm physician mild case COVID last month, objective standards. pulse ox hit 89 like 10 mins + body aches, fatigue, loss taste/smell. Never spiked temp 100.5, never acute shortness breath.

I used fairly active prior COVID - ran 10ks half-marathons. month think could run mile tried. acutely short breath wheezing, body seem want it.

It's weird. interested seeing long term data comes years come. dont license borrow know far many people enjoy feeling hatred point they'd relish delight everything collapsed. people every side political spectrum. well, except centre, think it.. BlUE lIVes MAtTEr  ethics true Christian without need promised reward. Well live Northern Ireland tend kill without police involvement that’s different story. 100% agree reasons protesting would want protest well it’s just.. There’s pandemic happening it’s unfortunate two things overlap Please proceed crawl ass can't type anymore. Yeah, really.  might want look data. It’s safe all. Extreme isolation even I'm calling for, I'm calling limiting exposure people, normally see said person invite thanks giving. Frustration understandable think end near people different tolerances risk. need patient accept everyone comply. fair, that's pretty far out. lot change many months. mean, done that, like booked cruise August.  Trump inconsistent message masks. good bad? Harmful helpful? seems depend solely mood he’s talking to. Trump muddied truth pretty much said hey believe whatever want, look USA now. good leader would stated know masks encouraged use. It’s they’re numbers. it’s predominantly old people young don’t know.

Thanksgiving Christmas might actually cause realize what’s going grandparents great grandparents don’t show died due COVID. never reason! Cremation much better option here. feels like shit look around wonder we’re reacting see everybody else going business. necessarily.

Plenty kids facing possibility long term disability unknown complications live parents.

Plenty workers deal antimaskers. Rose Garden Ceremony ACB evidence anyone needed. Everyone attendance negative test. Obviously work well. America Great Again? I'm confused get job mate would say take solace knowledge people definitely spitting food kind mentality.

But would mean COVID deal with. teeth big ? sarcasm. ""Oh no, end world. ever survive without fur industry?"". evidence suggests schools opening big risk. surprise medical professionals would make statements line evidence. don’t believe hospitals full can't engineer around need 660 million vaccine appointments happen (minus antivaxxers) waiting month everyone build immunity. think NSW still active cases local transmission too, new local transmissions two weeks either. Anyway Yes that's WW2 happened... I'm sorry. serve miners. SA 6 cases community transmission went immediately lockdown. deal New Zealand's streak broke, believe happen future.

No one wants months hard lockdown know vigilant wary. covid shows even peep community transmission, shit going get lockeddown hard contact tracing going rolled out. Yes I'm pro vaccine, taking new mRNA vaccine immediately. great treatments coming important role ordeal. I'm excited curious mRNA vaccines work out. I'm dumb, really really smart Yeah, sound like institution fulfills role union “What really center response fundamentals around testing, contact tracing, isolation,”

This advice, true, useless. 

Large portions country straight don’t give shit refuse common sense measures. won’t get tested, won’t isolate, refuse cooperate contact tracing.

If Biden puts national mask mandate half country refuse it’s government tyranny, horse shit. State local police refuse enforce it. that's absolutely worse 250k dead. It’s interesting compare Australia Texas well similar population numbers. People trying talk illness becoming real problem local area. state went 100 cases day 1,200 cases day super fast personally know people three different outbreaks, fine, ventilators. every single case, tons positives show symptoms, there’s always one person says, well wasn’t feeling good party/funeral/workday, don’t know would got it, assumed sinuses. recent case distant branch family lady went funeral hacking lung 80 plus year old aunts it, plus cousin respiratory therapist desperately needed hospital. heard got placebo vaccine approved going go back placebo participants offer real dose. know ""approved"" means general availability emergency approval what. friends son makes bows, (as bow arrows) deemed essential. 70% good enough everyone gonna get it. see there! absurd shit lockdown lifted bit massive easing restrictions and... anti lockdown crowd STILL went ahead protest Parliament station? think held there. how’s everyone doing? posted many times lots people studies literally don’t know respond articles anymore literally brainier...anyway offering free hugs 🤗 ""Critical public health policies disregarding economic mental health impact"" sounds exactly consistent logic presented above. Stop pretending know better. Glad know think winning debate club tho labeled overqualified h.s diploma. recession, even get job mc.donalds. could possibly go wrong? Ya know aside global economic collapse seeding possible second American civil war Life imitates art what. aren’t canceling Thanksgiving, sure hell won’t cancel Christmas. Probably Black Friday person purchases give out! Also Hawaii. US even managed fuck Hawaii up. It'd interesting was, hardest thing quantify would probably strength connection. Like, parent's close friends mean second cousin removed, put number that? Hmm... good news animal rights, definitely mean increase plastics waste... naked george got :-P

You know mean... lol Amazing quickly works. Yes. oldest population Europe, probably contributes. anyone information testing positive antigen *and* antibody tests time? husband's grandfather tested positive month ago 3 subsequent (positive) tests, recent today. Last week, tested antibodies, also positive. doctor saying contagious antibodies, can't find resources fully support this. I'd appreciate help input! people stupid, it. colleagues pretty much 100% quarantined since March...until now. Educated people wear masks time they're out, set foot restaurant's table, travel...but half traveling Thanksgiving. That's draw line. Fortunately, getting tested careful something silly, may bad, still going percentage cases tacked top usual anti-maskers case spikes. That's going shit show. Lol vaccine going begin distributed December US. would take 5 months get back normalcy?? Harvard: Yo, want scholarship? Anti-Lockdown Protesters Burn**,** Masks Manhattan New York Daily COVID Cases Highest Since April

Ah, great news extra comma make!  first two months rolling vaccines front line workers compromised people only. end two part vaccine. J&amp;J isn’t far behind. month most. time get approved emergency use, won’t behind longer stage. time general population start getting vaccine. 

I wouldn’t surprised lot healthcare systems already made deals J&amp;J (since household name others). systems waiting vaccine distribute won’t ever see others.

Either way, several several months (they’re predicting around April may) start considering loosening requirements like masks social distancing.  witnessed 100+ days violence left wing groups agitators across multiple cities... open see. left wing groups openly vocal violence burning would happen trump win well. way be. don’t know you’re trying invalidate people’s struggles. It’s extremely hard acknowledging fine. Doesn’t mean I’m breaking quarantine reckless, it’s still hard. 

Edit: you’re “crying almost daily,” sounds like it’s hard 🤷🏾‍♀️ Yep. y'all keep yelling us considerate people complying mandates *we're* ones snowflakes living fear! know exactly feel. You’re right, apparently don’t understand they’re killing vulnerable lives possibly giving others lifelong disabilities.  Ok, everyone ready ""Don't Fear Reaper"" jokes! 4 10 Americans selfish, ignorant, team-killing nimrods Still matter. wife gets 1 new mask every week (these supposed single use masks) due ""supply issues"". 

We spent hundreds dollars buy masks hospital threatened fire anyone brought masks union intervened got end idiotic policy. Aww. Poor workers knowingly take part torture murder innocent beings tweated wike dogs?? Awwww. That's really reassuring since every state's numbers going up. shut schools there's already many people wearing masks anymore. vaccine released, everyone stop wearing masks, causing huge temporary spike. Wow! shocked AstraZeneca would make pledge. That's incredible! source that? questioning I'd like read it. outsiders perspective (I’m Aussie) rejection help goes old tradition American exceptionalism individualistic US socially. think massively individualism conspiracy anti-science stuff. live deep Northern Virginia like 80% blue, gyms/malls/restaurants/bars completely packed awhile. OK, fine, great, known since *very first* autopsy series February done LSU Tulane. 

*Nine full months passed* still recommendation whether outpatients take even daily aspirin anti-platelet agent positive test result.

Excuse French, absolutely fucking inexcusable. much damage happening clots could prevented even simple outpatient study OTC ""miracle drug"" used prevent clotting every major clotting condition? Solidarity trial done worldwide show every major hospital intervention work, done study 100 cases outpatient COVID, would easily establish evidence benefit?

There's literally fucking excuse. None. fucking excuse kind. literally fucking guidance outpatient COVID American Association Family Physicians. could file malpractice lawsuit entire primary care medical establishment, would it. 

The British recently started study aspirin. started it. Maybe results useful next pandemic? words. brothers high school actually one schools still open PA open since August, super strict policies.


Masks mandatory, 14 day quarantine even near someone covid, 14 days cant skipped negative test, lunch must 6 feet apart, teachers must wear facemask, shield.  Ah okay. Well know FDA local health authority publishes data knew exactly link gonna be. Anyone reading comment who's even slightly interested dinos, paleontology, earth history, etc-- read it!

It's long read, one fascinating articles I've read past 2 years. awesome. Rapid City states second largest city local Christian radio station encouraging large gathering pray away corona. holding event front hospital. people protesting mask mandate. gathering pray maskless front hospital basically giving medical personnel middle finger. ""*Bed central location - 25% surcharge*"" problem many get replaced unemployed. went WalMart yesterday get things pack paper towels TP shelves empty TP packs paper towels there. month ago bought pack still packs full shelves never able fully stock still. SAMS worse. Forget stuff like Lysol wipes. Strange collection countries graph. highest hit eu countries (belgium, czech, even france), highest hit us states (even &lt;1 mil ones)  retarded illiterate?!? said “humanity selfish inherently” say “that’s excuse”. That’s like saying “I understand tigers carnivores that’s excuse eat animals”. Human beings don’t give shit other. believe care family friends let’s real. we’re driving interstate asshole cuts sorta wish parents chosen abortion one body parts rot off. foresight buy n95 masks COVID back January (I hoard, bought 10masks total). federal government healthcare giants see would serious begin prepping sooner? Yea really hard? HARD? really worth whining though? really. things bummed PALE comparison sacrifice gains hardly seem like problem. Really, easy. get every one struggling (I'm crying almost daily) shit aint \*hard\*. easiest thing I've ever done, staying home safe. Really article states otherwise. people would give money help one starving person, accept thousands starving people. larger number disables us. People comply

""What expect, nation's full sheep!""
- hoaxer, likelihood Maybe communal family gatherings? Honestly know, I'm interested cause. Can’t called hypocrite don’t make rules break! parent, would like believe that, feel it. Ask r/DataHoarder ArchiveTeam help out. Point proven US give vaccinations schools? UK vaccine I've ever got outside school (excluding ones got young) voluntary flu shot. recommended ones given school. awfully sobering statistics good know. PLEASE, EVERYBODY, PART! whatever keep healthy. based antibodies known disappear specific Coronavirus

Does friend mean antibodies wane actual antigen site disappear covid? former, know big concern would would bigger concern mRNA vaccines specifically. latter, sure concern demonstrated mink strain weeks back think expect Covid virus constantly changing point vaccine effectiveness short lived. feel mate hope luck turns soon.

Thank you. That's private extra steps. Ask date. relatives’ wills are, too. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ Keeping level fear caution exhausting can't maintained 

just terrible excuse people. Negligent homicide  Hawaii, supposed quarantine leaving CA anyway? Ok I’m gonna preface saying I’m native English speaker, pretty fluent it;

I thought “all forgotten” meant “everything except forgotten”? Like would left memories?

And yeah know thing probably haunt us right ‘23. economic impacts alone scarring, let alone many many deaths come.

What meant initial comment “everyone risk” vaguely referred everyone would critical condition risk death upon contact COVID. spend days bed pass like problem, long weak around protected vaccine, won’t risk harming you’ve fended off. believe that’s plan lot countries can’t make however many billions vaccines really needed full vaccination? Asking bc unsure Yeah one buy?  Wait able refuse even parents want it? backlash premier got making lockdown call insane. call was. 

I live Sydney living normal life months. friends
In Melbourne 5 month lock down. Insane. rest country appreciates really hope guys get enjoy fruits amazing work now. time summer too! done great job NZ Aus envy many us watching covid running riot countries  actually made times SARS MERS probably standby next coronavirus attacks humans. I'm fearful dying fear bankrupt.

Bankrupt possible long-term side effects. COVID 19, gift keeps giving. can’t definitively tell either. false positives. sucks. I'm sorry. heard happened lot due Covid. ""Buried article"". Apparently burden reading interpreting information article much people. People done locked . It’s fact. haven’t seen family 8 months. next tomorrow. Safe travels part decide go. Mask avoid can.  yeah work atl airport it’s super busy. went Kroger packed i’ve ever seen guess everyone’s thanksgiving lol. I’ll take cheap like Costco, online TP companies like reelpaper givesacrap don’t seem impacted panic buying risks rare. like medical operation risk failure. call agent orange... knew slush fund moment stimulus bill stripped oversight corporations receiving funds allowed stay anonymous 6 months. wish dead everyday. think good analogy, people actually tend treat dogs better. least many older people vaccinated point, maybe fatality rate decrease bit Try reading wrote then. Ive already stated times, im sure asking again. know brand best vitamin D? Hoping also helps seasonal affective disorder! Nursing home admin here. confirm vaccine mandatory staff. Possibility might condition admission residents. wholeheartedly believe social media lot responsibility misinformation there. new type communication don’t adapt regulate accordingly gonna lot issues long run. Sounds like 1 3 parents waive right medical care get sick holidays family. idiotic answer. 

Crime makes people go outside without masks infect perpetrator victims alike. Criminals even weaponize infection
 threat.

So shove deep. 2-dose vaccine, mean cover 200,000 people? oh fuck bigot. Better under-report early numbers outperform way around. people afford travel economic ruin caused year, 2022 number ridiculous. Spring 2021 much line countries’ distribution plans overwhelming majority adults (example, am, England, NHS expect country covered then).

As conjecture people going airlines don’t require this, tell I’ll using require this. Trump virus? Lol, im kidding... thing going roll around world many times least decade reality shows following individuals diagnosis eventual outcome, warts all?

An excellent question. Fuck em. Thanks! Got turkey breast, I'm going stuff flavored rice skin, delicious: protects breast cooking, crisps skin, delicious. 

Make ahead turkey gravy (using turkey wings), savory sweet potato casserole, gravy stuffed stuffing muffins, braised brussels sprouts bacon, home made cranberry sauce. 

Oh yeah. gonna good. Happily, somehow, Australia missed reaction. I'm curious hear someone unpick Vs finding proportion entire population facing long-term effects show year two?

The mRNA vaccine body make antibodies Covid spike protein, attaches receptor blood pressure regulator. understand body acts antibodies? there's, say, immune reaction blood pressure regulator, shows certain circumstances experience less regularly every 3 months? West River SD would like rid East River SD. One sentence buried article mitigate headline. covid somewhat regular bar. I’ve known several years I’m good tipper (never less 20%), tip character me. think genuinely thought meant leave twenty. benefits never expired. ""denied"" renewing trying make permanent. Huh. think Doc watching Fauci, said last week. Still, he's right; ""don't put brakes it"", *are* going bad way. wonder much due social media echo chambers. ""radical left socialist propaganda app"" *Kristi Noem* spent money tourist ads, general populace asked we'd like done money. Thank clarifying entirely inaccurate easily disproven point making? hope goes trial Publix loses. precedent best nation whole.

That said, Publix doesn’t pay 30k ever goes trial they’re idiots. Send field hospital Staten Island know. makes sense; however, observed French society whole thing. Especially second wave, worse situation got people started dying, conspiracy theories started coming out. Covid deniers, ""it's flu""ers, ""it's hoax""ers every single day. they're getting louder... insane amount misinformation public sphere. Ok, open 3.9% last 252 days. Way, man. Going back original point, makes East Asia=Authoritarian? plenty Asian countries friendly west (i.e. I'm assuming mean ""individualist"") committed sensible administration hard lockdowns, returning normalcy faster west. South Korea Taiwan couple. think slow burn since 70's changing way world works. lot due inflation without wages keeping up. Boomers seem love reminding us could get college. think many boomers legitimately can't understand can't that. cost living college skyrocketed wages remaining stagnant? course not. Millennials know save money spend avocado toast. 

Here second lifetime recession. We'll need see least one make hat trick. yeah, totally fault get it. awareness, winter can't get appreciable vitamin sunlight roughly anywhere north Atlanta. great source handy. know isn’t catch masks aren’t worn cockpit- hindrance crew coordination truly possibly less safe getting Rona sad nonetheless who’ve gotten it. parents complain. Parent complaints drive education. Sometimes better, sometimes worse. misinformed. I've heard Fox barely reports Covid. course far right media even worse. We're country actually making effort spread virus.

You really are. understand it. shoot foot? whatever decide best. don’t need approval internet ppl. secret (New Zealand) fucking love irrelevant time, leaves us peace chill out. Please, holy, let us work together countries try beat thing. Sitting ass anything helped us. UK day still functioning actual Monarchy 

lol yeh talking anymore actually believe this. UK proper monarchy since 17th century dude - figurehead. really huge spike holidays. Yeah, idea people downvoting you. Don’t want end?  you’re welcome first try yeah fast food places going make sure don’t anymore experience high school diploma don’t tell them? Give break. want work find it, don’t you’ll cry Reddit collect unemployment Reminds time aunt (who’s wealthy) left $500 tip young waitress $5 coffee. uncle pissed called dad whine dad hung lol. side effects? isn’t donald trump. Around 50% people voted whoever gerrymandering. problem lies people fellow americans. Whether like fact not, consist people surrounding you. 

If don’t like it, need convince people wrong. grew lot people tried avoid anything negative. Whether news, criticizing someone's behavior. think might older generations forcing kids happy want be, happy supposed emotion supposed experience. Last checked UK countries issues poor public response. isn’t American issue, global issue. Yeah need feed family pay bills things. studies waste time. Anybody believes (and science) already wearing masks things protect themselves. freedumb crowd say #fakenews, #justliketheflu, #hoax. Exactly. bot bans ""incivility"" leaves misinformation. Right. Lockdown tough, well worth it. Feels fucking amazing. would like also know overlap with:

 - health insurance 
  deductible, out-of-pocket maximum, ER 
  copay

 - whether PTO, disability, 
  savings cover quarantine 
  unable work due 
  quarantining/being sick/caring 
  another sick household member

 - childcare arrangements parents

 expensive questions. % capacity either full US gives indication. 

Relevant section might happen anywhere country. According Blavin's report, United States 728,000 medical surgical hospital beds available public 2018, 2.2 beds every 1,000 people, Blavin colleagues 36% beds available typical day, leaving 0.8 empty beds available per 1,000 states lowest available hospital capacity include Connecticut (24% unoccupied beds), Nevada (28%) Massachusetts (26%), Blavin said. way, probably wearing mask asshole instead mouth.

To fair, amount shit comes people's mouths, difficult distinguish two times. say 'misinformation'? I’ll wear mask wash hands *will* taking flights going movies etc. Mission accomplished GOP generations propaganda. Hopefully they've peaked soon witness downfall.

Alot peole going dead Christmas **wouldn't** remote Thanksgiving. Even promising vaccines horizon, going brutal winter. u appreciate dont touch, im sure would think doctor typically resource enough. Similarly cut people house, mom, aunt. part normal group separate small thing. understand risk fortunately mom works outside house room day filling rx bottles especially high risk. No. nothing education. It’s argument philosophy. Many, many Americans believe expansive individual liberty. Well... something flow...

Poop. I'm talking poop, guys. Ok, every little loop hole figured out, awesome them. not, pray I'm wrong issues already exist, yes gonna get worse. state government victoria asked city 4.5 million stay home 129 days stop rising (700+) infection rate. complied. Going 20+ days 0 coronavirus infections. I'm trying hard talk family gathering Toledo, Ohio Thanksgiving. 


I present, obviously. !remindme 4 weeks Yes is, gigantic buffoon. Noem touch reality actually thinks people act greater good instead themselves. Seriously, I’ll cut line want to. 23 year old friend pre existing conditions got hospital month COVID. I’ll take chances tested vaccine. /cries American starting creep Maryland well. stores also priced paper products pretty high markups pre-pandemic people may necessarily willing buy 10 packages stuff costs much more.

Fresh meat still bit challenge lot shops mom pop type grocery stores. Frozen stuff hit miss. None like March definitely moving direction quite here.  point partial public funding, far vaccine development goes largely publicly funded US operation lightspeed... also Oxfords development partnered Astrazeneca, pharm company. 

Also one owns Oxford either, really, besides whatever ownership administration claims it. argument private vs public, pretend Oxford private/public institution isnt subject human greed would erroneous, even overcome better most.

Also Oxford phenomenal job making thing, arent remotely equipped mass produce it. won’t. Military logistics heavily dependent civilian cargo airlines. people determined die? Always possible unlikely. half-full group substantial-sized, big enough efficacy rate easily statistically significant. important, clear mechanism counter-intuitive result would real, something adenovirus-based vaccine developers experienced makes lot sense. world -- immune response vaccine -- insanely complex everything, long shot, intuitive. different than, say, pharmaceutical therapies, results say lower dose effective would strange indeed. seems like job opportunities aspiring serial killers me. job growth? /s Ellsworth AFB. personnel PCSd Korea might able bring them. union workers used handle things back day. Time return tradition

In Minecraft Let’s honest though, people aren’t wearing masks they’re simply dumb continue on. know important. Yep, got one around age. think 3 rounds back then, circa 2006. Oi you! Stop facts! REDDIT!! I'm one saying know yet, one extrapolating data. fact astrozenica data released today says probably wrong. Haha. idea. % people living urban areas USA 83%, Australia 86%. Australia live city areas behaves like big majority viruses? march city summer. Every person went wore mask. Cases spike local church held maskless camp/jamboree last month. Wasn’t like 4/10 summer? family I’m seeing cautious pandemic, know non-zero risk someone could it, accept it. Family important us. I’m going miss parents going air travel. (But decided it) Ask people got $3k felt like dollar to
them Point proven. knew answer, I'd tell you. I'm quite honestly sitting home baffled are. makes sense me.

Meanwhile there's huge overlap people ""fiscally conservative"" politically speaking. idea going bring taxes long term? even 0.5% people get long term symptoms, that's starting become huge number. Someone's going paying medical care disability pay. Guess who's taxes going coming years?

It's stupid, honestly is. people wore masks, models show virus spreading fast businesses would better too.

But idiot businesses actually \*ban\* masks worn inside. neglecting require entry, actually prohibit them. make kind point. SARS-CoV-2 virus causing global pandemic cases continue rise. infected individuals experience mildly symptomatic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), unknown whether induce persistent immune memory could contribute immunity. performed longitudinal assessment individuals recovered mild COVID-19 determine develop sustain multifaceted SARS-CoV-2-specific immunological memory. Recovered individuals developed SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG antibodies, neutralizing plasma, memory B memory cells persisted least three months. data reveal SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG memory B cells increased time. Additionally, SARS-CoV-2-specific memory lymphocytes exhibited characteristics associated potent antiviral function: memory cells secreted cytokines expanded upon antigen re-encounter, memory B cells expressed receptors capable neutralizing virus expressed monoclonal antibodies. Therefore, mild COVID-19 elicits memory lymphocytes persist display functional hallmarks antiviral immunity. brokerage account excited hear Always USA, it?

Oh... understand. /s source “news” fox willfully ignorant, misinformed month ago. Wtf things change? Moved away conservative part FL mask deniers back June, think still wearing masks Publix (some chin diapers think sew/supply masks still). idiotic. known risks, verus unknown risks haven’t even read paper … don’t buy second,” tweeted Philippe Lemoine, PhD candidate philosophy Cornell University.

Science finest. /r/getthatguyabeer It’s really shame don’t enough behavioral health workers so? now? /s many people arguing going hurt progress. Thing is, lot people view ""slowing spread"" problem. feel like government overreach want get costs.

I agree understand it. Hence wear anything less KN95 mask work. So.. they’re saying outbreaks Thanksgiving probably worse imaginable Thank god virus much stable compared flu. honestly one potential “big ones” we’ve warned could’ve much worse. It’s like 7.5 magnitude earthquake. Devastating absolutely completely failed tackle it. can’t imagine bad it’d 9.0 magnitude. 

Even we’re unlucky, still lucked somewhat this. Yeah,my grandfather dead sure hell glad person infected ability make choices handle covid /s Considering construction Monument Health RC Hospital would die found ER door.

Those also people can't handle going church show pious are, need audience Catholic churches closed. Population density far less important majority country uninhabited. NZ urbanisation 86% compared US 81%, 1/3rd population single city. supposed burn gyms? Good Luck get vaccine entire population. Would want somebody eschew quality time family something preventing spending quality time yours? 💀💀💀 hahah random comment article agree more! Unfortunately vaccination immunity doesn’t kick instantaneously. takes weeks. that's alaska. Australia bigger lower 48. Yeah population lot smaller big cities like new york overall Australia urban population living cities (Australia 86% live urban areas, usa 83%). look small low population states USA worse hit moment :( confuse lack science knowledge lack emphasis science learning. learn things literally discovered yet, mean emphasizing already existing knowledge time. Also UK. absolutely case certain things. random drug tests. haven’t happen you, doesn’t mean hasn’t all.

You’re using word logical lot. don’t think means think means. “It makes sense head within worldview” logical.

It proven safe. They’ve followed exact process vaccines prior. reason stage 3 trials completed quickly virus prevalent. vaccines prior, stage took long time simply wasn’t enough infections outside challenge trials fast.  back down! ""Don't want hassled cops? Follow law.""

(I'll believe they're arresting people hear actually happening.) Wow. I've seen exponential curves day one almost square. It’s important distinction first 3 days indoor openings back May, 500,000 people flocked restaurants bars adding summer surge coronavirus cases. It’s reason indoor dining shuttered. saved jobs company vastly overestimating amount parents complain everywhere please! Thank goodness Yeah. problem lack plan. problem lack citizens following guidelines government want put forth money encourage people lock down. Unless government going start seriously enforcing lockdown serious consequences, pass another stimulus, think anything else would work.

That said, I'm open suggestions. can't get much worse now. yeah New Zealand can't relate popular tourist destination who's main income tourism... doubt even need masks next summer.

Took two weeks start symptoms feeling like officially recovered. never actually fully recovered. month afterward dealt bad vertigo, headaches, sleep issues. got better though went back gym. First day back worse first day ever step gym. could barely breathe short row. first time I’d every almost passed workout.

After got really bad. sudden started sleeping 16+ hours day. Could barely go grocery store. Couldn’t care dogs. Couldn’t work brain fog. Looking code like different language. like several months, slowly getting better.

I'm really starting hate citizen. We're country actually making effort spread virus. There's actual disinformation campaigns going improve spread virus anti-mask people misinformation testing negative means can't spread it. either get better supplemental oxygen go graves. known since Spring gets little publicity. seem perfectly healthy fall stroke, heart attack PE caused Covid-19 blood clot. outward symptoms. gets determined Covid test fact. Whoa, 4 ten people willing get injected vaccine nobody knows long term effects of, uses brand new technology (RNA opposed attenuated virus) entire world economy resting approval delivery. Who’d thought Due part also unmitigated spread. Waaaaait second. Last week seeing 95% numbers. Wtf happened here. probably case many countries. rich countries, difference $5 $30 insignificant. 

The US spent $2,000B Cares act, vaccinating everyone Moderna vaccine would cost $10B. Basically rounding error America. Everything point speculation, I've seen people suggesting delivery platform vaccine modified adenovirus, maybe full first dose primes body protect delivery virus itself, second dose virus gets attacked body enter cell start producing spike proteins provide actual covid protection cares, warnings useless, people quarantine-fatigued, vaccine weeks away. don’t think shame intent. republican leadership.

My friend family thought hoax dad died. wearing masks lots obesity everywhere

How defence statement. Yes average age higher. younger people die well. Younger people prior conditions like obesity heart conditions. Saying obesity everywhere supports fact fact people protests, many fact, risk covid.

Especially hospitals become loaded. El Paso, Tx we're already seeing mortality rate rise. We're seeing rise Utah. We'll seeing rise everywhere hospitals can't gain back control. We'll seeing younger people die well since conditions could saved previously able addresses staff. undeniably risk.

Also mentioned risks like obesity conditions, trying pretend age factor? realize wrong? LA! It’s warm enough don’t that.

Not though.  said, please avoid flying.  Please try limit distanced traveled size family gathering x... would different. 

I almost went grocery store yesterday.  mad house... hundreds (or more) people.  

These crowds spread coronavirus... family gathering blamed.

In job... told, ""tell people truth"". always works better likely get cooperation. think number dwindle 20%, perhaps even little lower people see safe effective. lot people want ""guinea pigs"", although personally realize we've probably determined safety already.

And family asking 30k cover costs related passing. 

So sad. mRNA something new we've studying past decade. i've read COVID vaccine first time mRNA vaccine used scale. literally impossible guarantee side effects appear years later type vaccine tested long term effects before. got seasonal flu shot i'll waiting awhile one. since I’m us vaccine trial use two full dose shots, already got first shot last Tuesday pretty sure vaccine..

When get second dose mean there’s 40 percent chance still get covid ?  put wall border texas instead mexico. Oh without doubt, time ex-governor railing Somali immigrants ""welfare cheats"" made quite clear allowed, immigrants people food stamps like would rounded bayonet point, chained together shoved onto barges, would taken international waters would shoved overboard drown.

I exaggerating even tiny bit. know flu vaccine released every year different guessed it. Viruses change!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! people be/were fine.

For things severe side effects percentage people affected usually low. (Think 1% less) problem 1% 100Million million people adverse side effects. Lets say 1 Million people adverse effects 1% serious side effects. Thats 10,000 people serious side effects.


So made numbers thats 0.01% chance serious adverse effects. decide risk one willing take. know long term effects long enough tricky. 


As long steps skipped corners cut fine though. Still hard want number 1 line. important get though many companies/scientists/organizations working risk low fact risk getting vaccine would higher. lose getting type rating? that’s serious bummer. Ten years? won’t even close major issue. Climate change life-altering discoveries much crucial agree you. Using adenovirus 'carrier' results product much stable, count lot time start vaccination programs. might say approach 'traditional' opposed RNA vaccines developed Moderna Pfizer. adenovirus approach presently used Russian major Chinese vaccines. China reportedly vaccinated close million people.

Adenovirus based vaccines well known well tried approach vaccination. hand **no previous RNA vaccine** market. totally novel technology. may problems yet discovered terms stability. *are* working DNA vaccines, command greatest use. DNA much stable RNA. 

There one BIG thing note flurry claims effectiveness. 'science press release', rather reviewed published articles NONE give information whatsoever margin error research. NONE. press release comes numbers given anywhere near firm. 95% *doesn't* 95% period. means number 95 plus minus another number. may even 'minus' part larger plus part. 95 may actually say 85 97 percent. 

All products judge effectiveness antibody response. RNA vaccines make claim also stimulate cellular immunity antibodies. True, false (most likely) ? know. time tell. 

At present time simply impossible judge real effectiveness Covid 19 vaccine. Real percentage expected cases would prevented given vaccine. Antibody titers necessarily infallible stand-in 'real meal deal'. Nobody knows, **or know**, right effective product is, various products compare. could real real world 90% claim Oxford may greater larger claims companies. knows ? Nobody *can* know. Vitamin always shows comparisons, but, causality always near-impossible prove:

• People already healthier overall could able get outdoor exercise, increasing vitamin D.

• People already poor health can't get outdoor exercise, vitamin deficient. 

• People able leisure outdoor activities might better managing health couch potatoes. 

It might ""vitamin make healthy, healthy gives vitamin D"". 

Just popping bunch vitamin pills might anything you. Yeah, comprehend number people planet long it’ll take get everyone? Weeks away... wishful thinking limited COVID.

Back polio vaccine came people couldnt really research like blindy accept certain doctors saying. think comprises physicians national guard? already assigned medical centers, act like ""civilian"" docs, meaning already working regional hospitals. pool thousands army docs nothing, waiting deployed. There's 4500 Army docs, intensivists. Brook Army Medical Center San Antonio already pretty full COVID, deploying national guard means taking away resources hospitals.

The point whole nation running trained doctors. never surplus physicians begin with, hospital policies past 2 decades resulted extremely lean staffing models. Goddamn, whoever incredibly shitty individual. Hope everything works right you. Wait minute... Trump said anyone know sure? Household get-togethers undoubtedly contribute community transmission virus. Canada’s recent Thanksgiving certainly added rising cases; increase may happen here, too, United States embarks holiday season like other. That’s Centers Disease Control Prevention Thursday warned strongly gathering others outside household dozens statements past weeks, political leaders public health officials said previous waves infection could linked nursing homes, meatpacking plants restaurants, problem unmasked people sitting closely kitchens living rooms, lighting thousands small Covid fires burn “It’s informal, private gatherings we’re seeing ignition taking terms infection rate,” Gov.

Such bullshit headline. sympathize laid can't work due restrictions lockdowns, people insisting upon flying holidays taking part gatherings? would say, hard feelings towards u/Dont-touch-my-gems, take medical advice internet commenters. Ask qualified medical practitioner received appropriate training vaccine give informed advice taking account personal circumstances, health history, risk area, etc. Nah, got 10% pay cut lost stock matching. 15% loss pay 0% loss work. Yes, depending efficacy alternative dosing *may* best worlds? haven’t said anything people sacrificed? I’m talking measures control virus. I’m sure accusing I’m sure misunderstood said. happy medium considering lockdown control control spread, mandatory social measures like masks distancing, measures like working home, cleaning subway buses, valuing health care workers, etc.

.We kept virus spread 1% months months NYC epicenter. control virus, place US control it, starting much better place back March.

I never said “ can’t let cure worse disease” I’m sure acting like it’s quote. ehhhh exactly relative individual guess make argument 

but community level that’s really dangerous 

imagine getting shot thinking work symptomaticly infected theres chance might missed boom infected community Yeah like even afford crying? Surely that's 200$ doctor's list. think vaccine weeks away actually working us, people see signal let guard now, help way.

""The boat life preservers way! Time dive freezing ocean"" That's literally advice ever get people try explain I'm constantly tired slowly dropping productivity work. I'm fortunate job acknowledge privilege, that's reason pretend mental health issues I'm facing legitimate. Canadian, still struggle comprehend ""profitable hospitals"". vaccine weeks away 90%+ us nonsense. would cold could spend 10 hours together they're cold? Plus Grandma frail. THOUGHT GRANDMA!?!?

Also don’t uncooperative patient general. Nobody needs extra bullshit handle right. days arbitrary, special meaning most. time slow people love (it always work way get lol) Star Wars movie?  do? Long-term effects Covid vs. Vaccine. I'll take vaccine :P takes flat earth logic feel mate hope luck turns soon. can’t even imagine tough year people aged 17-23ish so. Leaving school, uni graduating uni trying move forward life shit going trying isolate friends that. It’s lot head getting excited big changes early adulthood already precedent. lifestyle choices deemed high risk excluded receiving organ transplants. waiting millions least 6 months diving myself. second so-called ""lockdown"", literally things closed restaurants/bars shops considered nonessential. Everything else business usual. schools open, business require employees go office. really must restaurant/cafe/bars. scarily packed throughout summer, September October. Tiny crammed Parisian cafes thousands people unmasked. stressful sight. I'm happy hear numbers going down. “Wow! don’t say?!”, exclaimed take daily vitamin gummy I’ve taking everyday non-stop since pandemic started pointless study. Furthermore, completely ignoring detrimental effects past eight months society. economy crashed, dozens different sectors bankrupted, children lost year education social development crucial stages lives, increased use plastics, increased pollution, governments brazenly enacting dystopian hells overnight, millions idiots brainwashed afraid cold virus...the making legion hypochondriacs, Munchausen's celebrated. Half people believe totally normal, sane, scientific response virus. irrationally afraid respiratory viruses humans lived (and thrived) thousands years. Efficacy risk reduction. taking vaccine X% less likely average develop symptomatic infection. True. understand recommendation mean scientific...  ...What island non-covid scenarios there's emergency? Seems super sketch people live anywhere without direct medical access. Speed limits honestly exist lots American roads. driven autobahn, think would completely reasonable make rural freeways speed limits.

But lockdowns comparable speed limits. Lockdowns comparable banning driving prevent traffic accidents. I’m stating objective fact. unintended consequences whatever course action take. 

And no, vast majority people get covid organ damage long lasting effects.  Amazing many things I've learned dislike 2020. Pandemic real litmus test.

BOC, meet Smash Mouth. joining ""you guys suck"" list. Yea told family that. Got angry upset responses. Cannot control man infuriating I'm painted baddie 'because everyone else coming'. suspect lot people would go normally going year family shaming coming similar. unfortunate.

WHEN PEOPLE GET YOU, PEOPLE DIE YOU. Eh preaching choir guess.   would assume many doctors National Guard doctors civilian life. may many resources hospitals. numbers get high enough would better combat triage type situations. news outlets going can’t print doom gloom covid articles anymore? sub going do? equipped handle good news! Covid-19 side effects mild, may include muscle pain, headache, fatigue, fever, cough, diarrhea, rash, loss taste/smell, shortness breath, sore throat. Serious side effects unable breath own, pneumonia, lung disease, heart disease, organ failure, stroke, death occurred. Talk doctor risking exposure virus causes Covid-19. Dont think virus gone. pretty much endemic like Spanish Influenza aka H1N1  Thanksgiving June, Christmas July. 


My family brainstorming summer holiday food. Pumpkin pie ice cream, smoked turkey subs, mulled wine sangria, garlic rosemary french fries. could made it’s definitely real problem food (I hope anyone eating pork would cook it, killing virus, 2020 knows...), virus survives packaging someone touches touches nose/eyes get infected. I’d like see probably one order magnitude. Like couple million people vaccine one two months seems longest period time we’ve generally witnessed adverse reactions. probably case definitely front line access vaccine given I’m young healthy. drugs? even responding correct person? Meanwhile, Americans Reddit keep telling lockdowns work, refuse live fear, precautions freedom about. socratic oath: Saving annoying patients ""accidental"" euthenasia since 1,200 BC. That’s shit works lol live rural area populated many nurses (we live two counties hospitals), believe me, lack intelligence astounds me. Nursing, least here, becomes career option many high school stagnant job market take got. still respect hell though. majority population won’t get vaccine several months yet. J&amp;J already made deals manufacturing plants US start production vaccine. months ago. It’s also easier distribute vaccine like doesn’t require low temps storage.

I bet people (if given choice) would choose one dose vaccine multi dose one. vaccine stop person getting sick doesn’t necessarily stop person getting *infected*. vaccinated person could still become infected pass others getting sick themselves. true polio vaccine poorer countries sanitation bad. vaccinated person get neurological effects polio, still passed others vaccinated sewage. 

Studies coronavirus yet done vaccines development means frequently testing people vaccinated see positive PCR test show illness tracing contacts see anyone gets sick. focus developing effective vaccine. Following study participants future may determine still become infected transmit virus without showing symptoms themselves.

Coming full month Thanksgiving, going one bleakest Christmases lifetime many families. And, relatives indication, nobody seems care anymore. heartbreaking. Yes, good news still 501 deaths reported today, equal 2500 deaths US, good news pathetic comment. dumb thing everyone missing always gonna element risk taking new vaccine platform. *However,* likelihood serious complications/death bc unforeseen uncaught side effects vaccine FAR less caught virus basically given point. Monday usually body counts dump too. construction company, briefly isolate, paid extra raise EI full wages interest-free loan. Angry guys talk unbelievable shit may be, also know difference right wrong.

Also, I’m Canada, don’t seem quite determined fuck southern neighbours. think antibiodies good get tested keep mask near go near comment seems imply I’m lying something think scenario “sketchy”.   wear mask? others wearing masks? limit time store 1 hour? hope so. case, probably going fine. even transport them? can't imagine tie ambulances 30ish hour commute back forth. Yes. give vaccine candidate someone, it’s effective, it’s vaccine. Well now, definitely know media rooting for:

* Pfizer vaccine requires two hit claimed ~95% effectiveness? Headlines report 95%.
* Oxford requires 2 doses hit ~90%? Headlines report single-dose effectiveness ~70%.

God hate media. I'm glad worked end. I'm really surprised comments things impossible get. live US signing getting services seems incredibly easy uncomplicated. 

I calculated one point single earner family four gross income around $24K living expanses $1000 month end net $38 annual income (if include food stamps) + free health insurance whole family. addition, kids get $15,000 worth education public school every year. Medicare family four valued $25,000 per year, looking one person working 40 hours week, earning $24,000, paying $3000 sales property tax (directly part rent), family getting $97,000 worth goods services. So, way, long single income family two kids sort-of guaranteed middle class tax system.

So I'm always bit baffled everyone comments system work poor people. long single income family kids really unfavorable.

But two incomes $24,000 pay childcare, lose benefits, childcare tax benefit, move free subsidized health insurance, working more, spend less time kids, less time, end less money. good since I’m AZ trial two full strength doses? excited to

That's happens real scientists moved make room politically minded non scientists  Kind weird news keep doggedly excluding news Chinese Russian vaccines, also found largely effective offered lower costs.

The message largely clear: Western-made vaccines created properly safely unlike ones made Chinese Russian companies. 

Are really stupid?
Well, judging sheer number anti-maskers... I'd say that's resounding ""yes"". understood statistical significance sense mean vaccine dosing regimen working, efficacy certain. 

In fact several observers today trying come confidence interval efficacy based provided numbers. could anywhere 70% 99% efficacious AZ finishes trials. certainly 90% possible too, confident number throw right given low number infections group. People still mad corporatists voted office haven’t done anything promised, way proud admit reform wing party right accept they’re destructive republicans hate.

Just guess. Fair. there’s quite bit intersect airline industry government (hell US we’ve bailed directly).

I’m going go legalese rabbit hole one could argue industry basically public good sort. don’t know whole “private business, operate want” argument gonna work.

Full disclosure intend get vaccine it’s readily available. inside border airline worker get it?  one idea Alex Jones actually correct. Everyone concentrating catching virus (that concept failing pretty hard right now) almost no-one concentrating strengthen immune system body fight effectively. strong anti-intellectual bias America society. people therefore trust con-men “faith leaders” rather scientists. 

Combine infantile notion freedom get ... have. According polling data, mask usage across US consistently compliant 80% range.  Exactly. ""Honor Support Troops!""... long involve giving healthcare benefits.  Vaccine? want vaccine! want another stimulus bill full lockdown stay home without FOMO. didnt consent trapped house eleven months. didnt consent able work. didnt consent able see friends family. didnt consent education fall apart distance learning bust. didnt consent able meet people make connections necessary career

these reasons people kill themselves, surprise ive thought throughout whole lockdown bullshit

but lives mental health issues expendable. forgot. covid deaths tragic spanish flu killed 50mm? covid 1mm?  love Current situation well beyond point masks everyone would help. start (!) winter virus season already numbers. 

Europe (most countries) recognized situation early November implemented full lockdown already stabilized situation. people actually likely vary polls. Id expect first month seeing everyone else get vaccine rest fall line. dare you, demanding benefits family sacrificing country. 

/s  Lol. Watch somehow get downvoted going narrative would fighting let leave. survival instinct taking point pandemic. ""I kill kill loved ones"" kinda scenarios. selfish people ignoring everything thus endangering community. ancient times, threats removed swiftly. mom could've gotten bad one pass away know. People want lose moms guess According link, every single senator caught covid republican. ""we sorry got caught"" ever watch Dr. Campbell YouTube? seems well respected lays things clearly. good mood every time hears gaining evidence lasting immunity. made another video 3 days ago. says immunity lasting natural infection, bodes well vaccine (as would same). placing wellbeing people would harmed southern succeeding country? important around sanctions embargoes hicks start acting right.

PCR antigen tests looking what's snot, considerably lower threshold positive amount needed contagiousness. Unless somehow breathe without getting virus particles snot, seem possible test negative either contagious.

It's hard reconcile many stories ""false negatives"". (1) user error (2) tests probably done long contagious period, lasts days symptom onset, (3) maybe there's explanation. Even survival rate, rest people catch going lifelong health issues. It’s turning even asymptomatic people get heart issues long term.

If you’re willingly locking you’re part reason getting quarter million deaths. You’re reason didn’t even get first wave “second wave” started coming on. effected would say go ahead want, you’re effecting PEOPLE might part .3%. It’s lot people think is.

Families spread apart outside. try force it, less likely people get it. make mandatory. incentivize (since incentives make people skeptical). make completely free everyone wants it, incredibly available everyone.

Despite Fauchi subreddit's users believe, 75% vaccination compliance rate enough return normal. Hell, vaccine vulnerable 20% (severely obese people people 70), death rate would drop orders magnitude, would never risk hospitals overwhelmed covid again. That's ICUs always look like.

Maybe people actually afraid lives health, they'd take action. Instead, everyone thought you. ""Yeah, know bad, x, y, z, me."" is.

My husband young, healthy, individuals. textbook examples people ""will almost certainly recover fully"". Except almost five months later we're still feeling effects. can't smell says cognition seems effected. can't walk ten minutes without catch breath.   Employees walk  Covid pilot comes intercom: “the weather little rough ascent, don’t worry told rounding bend.” Freedumb essential life 'merica Drugs/vaccines tested long term effects (Phase 4) prior licensure. released market Phase 3 (i.e. trials large number participants). Phase 4 done drugs/vaccines market time.

People keep claiming long term side effects, side effects surface within months. wait years years Phase 3 put drugs/vaccines market.

The reason takes years normally due resources funding. Also takes years collect data diseases prevalent coronavirus right now. make sure participants actually exposed virus daily life, chance avoided it.
 

Also actually enrolled large number participants/volunteers. number bit higher normally get phase 3 clinical trials. knows people covid longer antibodies 3 months almost none 6.

We're basically lock Friday. We're state area Governor/state government willing so. However, folks still meet Thanksgiving things get real bad. Triage. clearly missed point saying. Humans trash don’t truly care one another haven’t since beginning time. wearing mask face doesn’t make hero there’s ton things daily cause suffering others way. expensive phone type crap made children pennies disposal cups slurp coffee every day. yeah.

* 1918 flu profile ... e.g. virus targets young people instead old ones. maybe instead 10-15% death rate 10-15% rate death &lt;25
* instead light end tunnel, vaccine comes, ensuring point - every single young American knows fact - thing coming me, inevitability, 10-15% chance dying. One two every ten friends 18 months

That real pandemic. article ban non-U.S. citizens China within last 14 days immediate family member U.S. citizens or/and permanent residents. understand people wouldn’t worth sacrifice? people’s families mean everything them, couldn’t get life without seeing them.  part problem, still would backfired them.

As someone trying get people treat pandemic like pandemic day 1, mixed feelings stories like this. realise information impossible figure enough time passed right? would know lasts year+ length time passed yet?? Serious response:

If everything functioning properly (see question 1), long ER visit take?

I've hour before. thought broke hand/wrist. vitals taken, escorted room, seen nurse doctor, got xray, followed nurse (my hand broken). took longer get someone pick entire visit. can't happen often? Darwinism putting overtime, see. There's lot people subs like /r/collapse various prepper spaces hoping COVID would crisis cause kind failure civilization they've preparing 

So they're really mad suddenly bearings escape route tunnel way pandemic even hits 18 month mark instead drug years trying safe advocating safe behaviors pandemic makes moron I’ll take it. one ever catch COVID-19 me. state level positions. fault rest state full fucking morons approval hearing Dec 10 believe Also... one it. say followed precautions but... didn’t manifest nowhere party. One people “did everything right” still brought it.

People need take precautions though others asymptomatic infectious. Ok probably less paranoid rational moment Alright want simple explanation go. could massive lockdown 3 weeks, completely stomp virus entirely. first day open borders tens thousands people enter Canada Mexico we'd virus spreading rapidly again. scenerio even possible fully shut either border even tried even could there's point. soon open Corona would spreading freely. Luckily shut bar back two days. there's still way know damage done 48hrs. Except wearing masks celebrating end failure ridden presidency. party goers assholes want fun Im disagreeing you. concerns, however, right long effectiveness last. sure state
specifics waivers however form fill ‘opt out’ test. us fill seeing 9/11 first responders treated, none surprise.  american. start Hospo work Whitsundays could get second year. Really derailed plans :/ Cool! Trump? Desantis? Rick Scott? People US exactly zero idea military works money spent on. sub even aware inaccurate PCR tests are? test used around world. give insanely high rates false positives. “Cases” don’t necessarily equate illnesses contagious... bedbug logic. already? arguing whether effective, whether legally encoded function similarly. 13th amendment quite clear, slavery illegal U.S. unless one convicted crime. Good them. Id like see figures many 65s die cOvId rELaTeD dEaThs. I'm estimating even close 1%. world's gone fucking mad. cases people contagious 10 days, considered contagious anymore fever 24 hrs symptoms improving point (it's upped 20ish days experiencing super severe symptoms hospitalized).

You actually continue test positive 90 days initially catch it. CDC recommend employers requiring negative test return work. 10 days considered contagious even continue test positive another 80. safe, wait exercise 50-60 years pandemic.  ""Essential"" extremely broad. Tens thousands people cross San Diego / Tijuana border every day. Yeah wonder key - Portugal curfew restaurants still open... We've going sideways best last weeks, high level. I’ve got sweet, stupid ex moved WI FL. Spoke last night Covid acted nothing worried about, even said couldn’t believe scared it. Lol I’m spending alone, decided I’m gonna Christmas decorations start Christmas cards day. make festive even though I’m myself. What!? That’s main reason - China import food can’t feed people, imports consumers demand variety market economy. import french cheese, Australian beef, American frozen dinners. Restaurants bars private parties whole enchilada. Everything else combined minor factor. think we've learned least now. surprised see one photos article shows airport security line person wearing mask nose...  tijuana san diego border traveled world 70k vehicles 20k people crossing US every day. supposed close border entirely? People's lives depend boxer every day. Yeah it’s hard he’ll get nba HOF. supposed give away? ""We got COVID gathered together family. know could seen coming! We're good, little boys girls. Santa's nice list year, going apologise God bad thing after. We're sorry.""

It's like closing gate cows got out. told, warned. think consequences applied them. I'd say feel sympathy them, capacity sympathy all-time low reading same, god-damn story every week. And, careless disregard spread people even party. know family members, knows else close contact with? I'm just... tired this. I'm tired dang story American hubierus. Anti vaccine sentiment bad outside hardcore pre-covid antivax crowd.

Political resistance acknowledgment virus' existence severity bizarrely somehow preclude acknowledgement getting vaccine soon possible vitally important bring back full 'normalcy'.

As soon distribution begins, I've feeling resistive social precautions clammoring first line get vaccine they'll perceive instant gateway back lifestyle can't handle severed enjoying freely.

The hardest thing ensuring everyone gets *both* doses. Many going feel ""one good enough"", especially experience side effects first dose. fantastic insight. also beliefs PTSD somewhat western disorder well. Especially emotional psychological cPTSD. 

It experience trauma similar fashion. world allowed carry around feelings emotional betrayal way west. 

In west given medicines make us better doctors psychologists. places without mentality, learn get emotional scaring order face world. animals. escape predator stop shake carry - probably better us, east west. 

But west especially, highest percentage people vitamin deficiency, obesity, diabetes, etc. Perhaps important link accumulations bodies accumulations within psyches inhibits rejects change lifestyles. carry psychological wounds become sensitive reactive future threats. Americans normal people would buy going live life get vaccine however 50% people country say they're going get vaccine regardless reason really expect things back normal May yet state voted 4 Trump. Freaking morons Good grief! That’s funny. don’t see many masks picture. people's stories made family change behaviour, means family's story change families' behaviour either. Everyone keep saying ""but special, hur hur hur"" end starting cluster, featured article, etc, etc.

You can't fix stupid. brother St. Paul hospital COVID-19. people like you, might alive right now. Keep fighting good fight. Yes, agree. British people might know theoretical scientific facts, totally abstract everyday reality covid shown knowledge applied decision making even crisis. getting killed expression love.
this deadly virus. stay tf home let family stay homes. remember time reports growing coronavirus cases Wuhan written fear mongering too. 

For it’s worth, I’m virologist I’m concerned COVID-20 emerging one mink farms. I’m saying situation mink point yet, disaster waiting happen needs shut fuck down. Deal. strange spelled 'smart' ""p-u-s-s-i-e-s"" One million Americans US airports , one million Americans tested positive last week 🤷
May odds ever favor  Tradition! Makes sense wish could take break. going school pays bills since live military benefits. feel like choice keep taking classes learning anything. Add Wikipedia see happens basically, yes? POS guy lol happens vote Consevative.

Next talk Kentucky terrible schools. Turn Java script 20 new cases per day: China freaking testing pork knuckles.😂 pandemic made alcoholic view biggest way get virus levels low never let get high first place, mentions. West learn hard way first time. 

Yep. key point everyone missing. cat bag late. Asian countries prepared SARS experience. understood speed everything. Western countries didn't. Yeah, timescale tantalizing clue AstraZeneca results imminent. According virus survive fabric day two, really you. Lately it’s run phoney preachers Freedom again. fair, bigly organized disinformation campaign thing since beginning.  

A big portion necessarily critical thinking skills- forming opinions based getting facts bubble misinformation. Except develop COVID, would place additional burden already squeezed healthcare system. I’d say still selfish. fair, also mentally broke lot people. anxiety. covid continuous cough, get symptom. coughing fits. think antivaxers sides political spectrum. Republicans might forced vaccinations necessarily vaccinating themselves. maybe night two. fly cross country $500 less sometimes. Several weeks hotel far that. True, steadfast anti-vaxxers would see bribe fuel fire. Yes China ""glimmering society"" complete concentration camps, total censorship, 1 party dictatorship. Get grip. governments sane country allowing come dock?  Especially non-essential businesses forced shut down? burst production solved dire shortage defined first wave coronavirus. surplus may enough prevent large numbers record numbers coronavirus cases overwhelm hospitals across United States, something strikingly different surge inundated cities spring: one clamoring sophisticated breathing machines, used sustain critically ill patients, far plentiful eight months ago, New York, New Jersey hard-hit states desperate obtain devices, hospitals reviewing triage protocols rationing care. Now, many hot spots face different problem: enough ventilators, nearly enough workers years training operate them.

.... screw every case, initially. Doesn’t matter obvious damage perfect documentation incident is. probably 4 5 times more. will, least 90 C quite reliably. 

Handling risk depends amount virus. Unfortunately, know minimum dose ingestion. higher aerosol, 10^2 10^3 thrown around virologists, seen really good evidence this.

A speech droplet contains 10^7 10^8. amount would dangerous normal handling sure, 10^5 probably manageable normal household methods. Could please stop posting paywalled articles? ...that's works. neighborhood infected child's drawing. Stop ridiculous. [archive link anyone trouble accessing article Thanks switched original paper colleges chose money lives. Students didn’t away matter. Dropping would devastating effect many students isn’t something do. Holy shit must sheltered would honest feel. Maybe offer zoom meeting like everyone says thankful whatever tradition guys have. would tell really love personal all, fearful health family's health.

I think making smart decision, though. Better sacrifice one thanksgiving risks associated covid.

Also, thank thinking healthcare workers. big brother med student rotations hospital scary year seems like one gives crap healthcare workers, med/nursing students families either quarantine go home to. thank x 100 giving shit Shh they’re already burned out. Embrace courthouse! That's I'm aiming for. wife waffling issue. board start year half gotten married, seen friends family getting married (pre-pandemic) gotten bit envious.

I keep telling that, yeah, huge wedding bells whistles...or stay course get new car downpayment house sometime next year.

That seems snap back reality. Haven’t community case Vic NSW two weeks. would virus completely control stopped international flights 

Everyone Aus took lockdown seriously. Also helps isolated fly afford hotel. Indeed! difference time screwed 9/11 responders 9/11 long since over.

In case workers know covered get sick die. That's likely going change willingness handle COVID patients going forward. Well live Arizona kids, friends kids nieces/nephews entire AZ university system. Maybe learn self serving self reported low effort media reporting investigated looked healthy air skepticism. read article call bullshit finer details, based experience. friends likely avoiding news Covid “mental well-being” engage risky behaviors “mental well-being”. 

They think since got test threw huge party safe thing family Thanksgiving. 1000% didn’t isolate two weeks got tests since least one flew town party... 🙄 Fair; airports also potentially dangerous people wearing masks. science suggests flying general particularly high-risk activity compared indoor gatherings lots family geographically disparate areas mask wearing. No, rare people robust natural immune response covid. Nothing new Lives money There’s difference belittling people calling people something simple wearing mask. Contact tracing places low community spread.  Can't obviously 100% sure, could suspected cases least. course viruses create domestic violence. 

However, major changes within environments create much higher probability emotional reactivity. natural. Here's random study: excuses domestic violence. 

But point since know correlation, educating people deal it. People warned might emotionally volatile right now, especially pent inside. encouraged engage activities order avoid repressed emotions blowing up, pretty much anything do. 

That's something media do, directly save lives. help would perpetrators refocus frustration positive ways. forwarn would victims come safe solutions put situation risks violence. 

Meeting situations increase likely hood violence education neutralizing violence common sense. Blame help anyone. Yeah! I’m going like 4 people cookout. won’t even related! FYI likely removed title must match article title exactly. Peoples responses pandemic really tells need know many them.

If call hoax argue masks go cruises, lack critical thinking skills can't evaluate reliable sources information. know never trust decision making.  could time takes process certain tests such, right. lot docs ""behind scenes"" speak. 3 docs every 14 patient rooms, 2 docs sign admit. already doctors dealing 8 patients time. throw radiology take minutes arrive bring scan, ct take 30m process, doc takes read record, get visit. 

And add half hour something big happening anywhere section (cardiac arrest, stroke, seizure). 

From I've seen, docs work steadily. constantly computers reading, recording, whatever. getting paid.

Because someone online mean wont go school. someone mailing address Iowa doesnt mean staying 15 minutes campus. sure exams need person well. exam time we? virus create domestic violence DeSantis probably scared shitless Biden investigate Covid death numbers. *hunkers hoard pasta rice, flexing claws gently single box orzo rolls floor* enjoying financial privilege.

🤣🤣🤣 Clearly absolutely concern troll trying push skeptic agenda. couple quick questions. think purpose vaccines developed various vaccination programs organised? anything creating herd immunity perhaps?

Goal ≠ strategy fun dying medical staff quits sounds sort similar disability claims initially denied try get people give go away. sort thing lawyers eventually sort out. incredibly infuriating grieving family jump hoops get due.

A public agency private one punished sort antic. Working retail entail getting robbed necessarily 

Being medical professional means caring sick ?? way! Seriously? Trump fans suppressing.  even realize vote suppressing Yes, 7 9yo. Helps I’m state people take seriously kind people getting cruise ships pandemic kind people listen CDC. could probably tell there's Ebola board they'd ask onboard drinks credit compensation. say know better they're Swedish. Quite opposite fact. yeah, sad they're campaigning using numbers mass downvote anything critical Swedish handling Pandemic. Yes, that’s exactly controlled efficiently effectively UK well. Oh... US. Ugh, outrageous! bought tickets cruise little ago, suddenly unsafe? come nobody told me?

I also bought immediately waking coma. something going on? talk mod r/coronavirus deletes voted comments support agenda??? that's state Texas is. governor literally care less seems. months ago thought he'd actually understood severity virus capitulated Trump's rhetoric. Classic GOP governor. thousands people die result. 

There’s nothing do. family members take every precaution, go where, get vaccine soon it’s available. months this, point, people’s brains saturated propaganda nothing change opinions — that’s people dying COVID hospitals still saying it’s real. It’s maddening work office even go vs, work home (I assume you’re office worker job basically entirely done home).

Employers office employees directly responsible much spread. definitely need much time keep news. Watching TV work everyone, focus finding quick online resources keep posted. Completely different conversation asshole. would intensely pissed one patients. asthma, incense Church uses one triggers attack. get timeframe. know fear drives sub science.

Nope. addition delusional unique ways, one radical liberal listens MSM Twitter. got hard day Jr getting Covid. Dude, grow get hobby. got real mad jumped soapbox.

This spring made work due end semester (so basically due dates), weekly schedule recommended week. Unfortunately many students waited last week 5 weeks worth work. 20% student evals complaining lenient made easy procrastinate. 

I’ve also found students aren’t watching lecture videos consistently. I’ve tried one long video, 2-3 smaller videos, using people’s YouTube videos... get 50% viewership (and idea many finish them). I’ve always good evaluations regarding engaging lectures, don’t think that’s problem (though could wrong). think longer lectures I’d even fewer views. 

The options ones I’m trying include more. I’m letting students either opt last exam they’re already happy grade take replace lower exam score (if better past exams). didn’t tell option beginning semester, think I’ll tell spring class hadn’t thought might help reduce anxiety.

That's easy, seize control medical schools Defense Production Act crank bunch doctors nurses record time! one lying. 

Given level stupid takes hold family get together, numbers spiking **8 months pandemic**, bet multiple people lying family not, fact, ""do right things"".

They're making excuse seem flat-fucking dumb are. Lol fun inside nerd hahahaha, oh embarrassing hahahahaha RIP sub continually bans comments show insights political factors driving pandemic, response, lack thereof shows disgraceful lack awareness overall context.

Why bother running sub can't bothered deal realities subject matter entails?

It ignorant nonsense believe myriad problems experiencing unrelated leadership driving public health policy, utterly pointless discussing problems without real world frame reference. Honestly, quite easy stay uninformed. I'm standing people live media/news blackout, BUT. Everyone strengths weaknesses, us can't tell news pure BS ..
 Personally live lifestyle such, cause can't differentiate between. say easy, many is, thats them, folks like myself. And, degree, dangerous put ignorance middle brainwashing also. unlike most, I'm aware news illiteracy, find folks trust focus still iffy, best do.


That said, even ignorant self tell need stay away people awhile hermit *duck now. 8 people vaccinated got covid vs. like 95 people placebo got it, 100 people got covid means 95% effective. yes sample size calculation small, get 100 people took 30,000 people find 100 infections. like infection rate 0.3% 30k, study would need time accumulate infections. others mention, statistically could power test maybe n = 100 infections good enough 80% power (80% time study ability determined correctly). 80% statistical power rule thumb, idea actually used.  Great comment well said. got buried comments, wanted let know really appreciated it. Possibly, numbers could argued inaccurate though. well big differences age distributions. Thailand virtually population UK, except everyone school normal, walking around huge shopping malls, transmission covid nearly 6 months. Enjoy going concerts going sporting events guess. is, definetely. Numbers barely starting decrease.      
With lockdown, take full month come back ""low"" numbers August.      
Without lockdown, can't imagine...  
They reopened soon first time, least two weeks soon. That'd silly reopen now. socialize interact without going huge gatherings confined spaces. See, Americans switch using bidets, get save SOOO much tp! problem takes one irresponsible person infect huge group people. bar packed 100 party-goers might 99 responsible people there, 100th thought ""I'm feeling hot, beer might make feel better"", they'd infect large portion people there. 

And symptomless cases. 


It's shitshow. US already 200k infections day. PA actually enforcing testing state visitors? said need lockdown stop spread.  Thanks thinking dental team. considered sending link article family gathering resulted tragedy say ""I can't bear possibility happening family"" long make clear staying away love worry safety fine - want what's best family, different opinions means. Repeating mean still misrepresenting position. “Ughhhh dieted morning deserve milkshake — Metabolism isn’t fair!” possible know; possible picked thought safe trip grocery store. tough time sure. think lot us going similar stuff lately. definitely alone it. ""Talk it"" best remedy I've found! Exactly! may social-distanced, washed hands, wore masks, ultimately piss wind without centralized co-ordinated lockdown. LMAO, fun inside nerd Thanks explaining that. I've always frustrated go ER, knew simple people lazy.

Nah, that's cool. I'm actually concerned, using example. know they're level one, nearest 200 miles away. helicopter so... get irreversible cardiac brain damage corona-virus smooth brain. 99% guys keep touting include complications get get corona, even survive it. Staff ICU beds main problem. Dont know I'm following joke election. young children? Good luck keeping clean, hands face, mask on. Humans aren’t equipped say “No” attend family member close friends wedding due pandemic. It’s government needs step limit weddings 10 people less. People won’t limit gatherings themselves. noted:

There credible scientists narratives arguing restrictive measures negative impacts. That's nothing straw man meant give platform people want downplay threat argue necessary restrictions. haven’t infected. It’s hard understand. Colds around forever, yet everyone gets time, possible? /s K reposted completely wrong cool Socialization human interaction essential activity. Refer Maslow's hierarchy needs. said thousands people tested different areas, different vaccines different companies. one gonna ""The One"". like flu vaccine many many different companies. Last time went get flu shot required employer, 4 choices shots. whole thing peaks valleys. Today far example went like this:

Woke feeling pretty crappy slept 4 hours first time

After breakfast completely breath coughing. 

Felt bit better later

Later sneezing started first time. Also got first sore throat. 

Got completely exhausted slept two hours. Felt like crap after. 

Feeling better right sore throat still there. 

This weird shit. comes goes completely shitty ok quickly multiple times day. imagine counted among non-insane americans must difficult. goddammit fucking hate country much wish wasnt born american  mean say whatever want, like I. Perhaps someone wants informed involved meaningful discussion covid, without tasteless jokes, telling sub, meant precisely ""high quality posts discussion"" (from sub description) covid, them. like went meme page complaining. nothing high quality, contributing discussion, comment replying to. That's point. nothing stop it. Getting Americans gather 9 months concept like ""world peace."" close bars restaurants. spread someone die happens freedom? everything you? far I'm aware there's data immunity 1 2 shots, prudent strategy give everyone 1 dose hope best always really appreciated I'm sure too. remember close vote Florida, they’re idiots even though they’re still majority :/ nice. Perhaps 2 months another 100k deaths nationwide.  least 50% American population stupid make decisions therefore follow peoples' lead. People absolutely take accountability actions, unfortunately, live world legitimately selfish, short sighted, smart enough to. probably mostly immune due herd immunity. young people probably didn’t even notice. think meant would widely available April. September def realistic timeline everyone vaccinated (if enough people take it...) even bother trying reason drug abusing loser. trash covid after. Mentally damaged. protective pod circle though. NYT columnist pod realized included lot risks decided wants visit people anyway. Everyone thinks exception. Can't disagree dead. part choices. take vacation every year. afford spending $100 week going bars eating out. Thata $5200 year pocket.

Now deny many struggle budgeting, think also comprehending willing forgo benifit future benifit later. Like seeing grandma year see rest.

There lot, whole lot, wrong leadership power North America I'm convinced dump lack self discipline them. Jaron Lanier thinks could totally restructure ethical manner chose to. People probably ironically sympathetic knew nothing March. work retail. still see f-cker come store every day buy two items. read another thread someone brought up, someones response many people would feel skeptical vaccine. Especially antivaxxers. Theyll make seem like there's something suspicious vaccines.  Mormon leader wont suggest masks either. Hes retired surgeon. Hes playing safe ""flock"". realize die cant pay tithing support person's right practice religion, think foolish. expected group celebrates God sending plagues impose will. think made pretty clear want one passover family; gather large groups. Stay home; sheep's blood needed. wife (limit it), August, honestly fine. two friends come witness/record front judge, behind glass. could take masks say vows. regret nothing, even though would’ve nice friends/family there. We’ll party everything safe again. don’t see hard people. Overflowing ......what now??? afraid google  cancel year double next year Reason ask would happen give 1 dose 2x many people? kind ""training"" immune system safer manner actual virus. I'm non doctor trying educate lol. ya that’s actually worse lmao So, hospitals Florida completely overflowing what? Well ""Death Everyone's Destiny"" amirite? need get people tested per Bolsonaro. panic buying isn’t something proud of.  Hopefully not. go people forced deal public. Everyone's high risk, Covid destroys lungs rest life. Nope. Guess need 7 digits. still considered bad thing point tens millions Americans already immunity Im watching series Great plague London 1665 found sobering said people would sneak quarantined houses see friends even riots prtest people able go outside despite sick.

Almost 400 years nothing changed. Italy, created system essentially based age. First one 80 allowed bed. kept lowering age. think time finally got things control lockdowns, reached age cutoff 60's. Pretty depressing stuff. 

In NYC, stopped paramedics revive patients who'd gone cardiac arrest. simply ICU beds them. We'll likely see across country January. 

Some cities plans open satellite ""hospitals"" places like convention centers. problem though becomes staffing, PPE equipment. That's important people take seriously. We're headed dark times pretty soon.  Freaking 20 cases per day precisely method avoid 1500 dead per day bugs point people super paranoid super lax. 
I like middle somehow seems almost wrong. Well...good wanting others see experience maybe learn it, Lmao like [this right Tell CO heavily infected aircraft carrier. 😓  would bet majority traveling also following rules, need break.

You stuck traffic, traffic. major networks last month. Here’s link CBS news covering time sell holiday travel tickets. didnt template similair virus (mers?), close potentially vaccine even science today. science massively advanced doesnt mean fast good enough. bulk efforts attempted tried controlling covid we've centuaries. science explains what's going hell lot better, ability fight changed much. Even gets massive assists advances elsewhere. It’s sad sea levels rising. people want get sick, infect others collapse health care system, what’s stop except common sense? CDC's website. Google it.

Also start pandemic banned travel China directly, called racist ban liberals. mask thing meh issue, first planned white house cancels white house reason might've cause panic countering. Remember people went crazy food toiler paper? really desirable. year draw conclusion excess mortality

What's right wing political trolls inept desperate prove death toll fake? claimants dead came table.
A good strategy.
""If keep denying claims, eventually they'll die pay out."" *brushes hands* mean, could true I’m highly doubting people haven’t hanging friends much pandemic houses. doesn’t seem like something us Americans would patience for, I’m different I’m introvert there’s way people weren’t already often. Plus, going house small group friends separated people outside friend group better around people aren’t close circle. Less spread still. really easy angry people that's all. elect leaders make policies deal real lives real people part knowing that, allowed, behave like this. people idiots people. thing angry allowed endanger many worsen bad situation overstrain healthcare system vaccine impact many die. Vote sick monsters out. That's price freedom. So, totally agree you, bus left station protests happened people sat silently, joined, supported massive hoards. think protesting social justice different attending football game, communities, media, whatever, probably least made commentary types people think equal planes. based upon understanding PCR (as part work) rather something I'm citing scientific literature. Ct values reflect individual's viral load time testing; PCR tests best done days infected, viral load would highest.

I dig far this, one paper shows Ct values change course Ig I'm proud idiot Overheard neighbors resort town (US East beach). symptoms fever, still plan visit family AZ. think conspiracy get tested let family know ""if test results arrive time"". Can't get together family thanksgiving.

Pretty inconsiderate people folks. History rhyming. Ad hominem

It's ad hominem true. thing see going wrong safety issue going 30,000 Phase 3 trials 25,000,000 health providers at-risk groups. nearly 1000x ""study power"" could turn bad side effects. vaccines successfully jump hoop resistance crumble. hate people hear family event Covid spread think ""Oh look, family event everyone got sick. happen us."" get shocked get least one hospital dead.  mom survived covid left looks like permanent lung damage top diabetes type 2 already still refuses wear mask mandatory. According they're bad health anything. reading conspiracy blogs internet. 70 years old. Pregnant women higher risk covid, good informed safe! don’t know long term effects covid, may really done critical step keeping baby safe :) Funny we’ve learned much 8 months yet people still don’t listen. indoctrination crazy strong. Sometimes doubts creeping head: ""Will people think we're actually married ""married?"" ""Will others think got married reasons love?"" ""What tell kids ask wedding ceremony?""

But think could 100k-200k money I'm like...hrm...yeah, I'm good. medium.com may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage, post automatically removed. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

In case, would 0 sympathy definitely going taking physical care if/when brings COVID home. Here's hoping become issue. wife asked move Florida. told there's lot idiots there, mean Lot. Case point.

If want die bad, let them. think bigger issue one asked people that.

They said two weeks, went cohesive federal guidelines response, every state different, president saying wasn’t real wear mask, said wear one, got three days (not really that’s looked).

No one told people would spend seven months apart. year. might done asked. Trump refused right thing it’s confusing hell goes on.

People right thing. one even really asked Texas. road rail links, short boat ride away.

I’m see two family members Thanksgiving. Test, quarantine, drive house Thanksgiving drive back home. testing well. 

It best right now. don’t see friends. don’t eat restaurants. mask social distance. understand testing doesn’t predict future results. Testing doesn’t protect me. captures point time.

Family friends related chance. 60% -80% infections asymptomatic. It’s exactly this. It’s frustrating. need risk-reducing view thing one gonna listen. gonna deeper hole covid sick days maybe. 3 week lockdown started playing football/soccer immediately like 3 times week. Never issues. dad hand conpletely exhausted weeks. way could ran even 10 meters time person's prognosis years contracting HIV, without aggressive medical intervention?

Pretty good treatment. live florida stopped gas station beer last week. Saw customer wearing mask literally 3 clipped keys. People dont care unless they're forced wear mask. feel like mine ones supposed year. Make fun Facebook? Cool

Make fun reddit? way! hurt you?! mean honestly I'm back whatever want wear mask it.  Waste ICU resources US? 

I find unbelievable Americas could flout health care risk like public funded health care. get sick, they'll hook hundreds thousands dollars. worse condition, worse debt become. 

It's waste medical resources ... windfall private health care companies.  Actually, became harder make sustain claim NYC 2007 9/11. fairly recent 

It 77 years since Holocaust. Germany gone beyond make amends. world let go even though countries done (and continue do) worse things. 

It comes point ok say ""It happened. horrible. made amends moving on."" Jesus

I remember younger excited internet connectedness world online. hindsight now, dangerous tool too. new species ability us spread disinformation widely instantly believable approach something need national conversation about. Yes exactly. butt fuck relatives want come Christmas. Stay hell home, morons. J&amp;J may till January. AztraZeneca/Oxford coming mid-December though. someone previously pointed me, many countries good place would notice port workers/handlers getting infected, importing virus major concern? single word ignoring Black Friday right guys? single one going question anything Thanksgiving spending money ass Amazon retailers next day? hypocrisy among absolutely amazing. Watching get played like fiddle quite something. treat like diet. ""I shake breakfast, salad lunch, healthy dinner, giant slice cake? balances out, right?""

True story. used work guy shake breakfast, shake lunch. dinner came actually ordered ate two different heavy fast food dinners. ask says shakes substitutes ""meals time"", meant could double dinner. told that's worked, insisted sound diet.

Mentalities like make surprise articles come out. They’re also meant alive. Sometimes gotta sacrifice one thing another important thing. there's even going room grandma hospital coma ): mutant Denmark strain? even know? Done done. Good luck! barrier entry far lower nursing terms education fees doctors. 

The years spent training one’s youth good health far lower nurses doctors. 

“Doctors aren’t paid enough” sacrificing entirety twenties likely early thirties careers, missing raising families, incurring tremendous student debt meet minimum qualifications required practice. Nurses expectations pursuit subsequent degrees like NP, DNP etc unnecessary practice bedside. 

“I respect doctors,” say next comment. No, not, evident words attitude. disgusting little cover-your-ass comment. I'm making Texas style chili sauce made dried chilis (no tomatoes beans) turkey leg meat ground turkey instead beef. Kind excited try out. I’m sorry seems pretty selfish. know concerned PANDEMIC decides invade airspace? Tell no? they’ll kill themselves. cousin works Baptist Health (big company Miami-Dade) recently told 28 year old preexisting conditions admitted hospital ICU Covid. Spent time unfortunately make it. party somewhere Miami got it. fun games happens you/someone know. think it’s mentality it’s safe. Sure couldn’t going they’re meeting maybe they’re meeting others. response already raised risk saying sick would “wear mask.” 

If stay inside apartment 3 hours amount wearing mask going help that’s virus works. It’s places closed grocery stores open you’re supposed grocery store three hours. Oh interesting, never heard final outcome investigation thing happened mass hysteria. Nothing. want 100% safe staying home. forcing everyone stay home. No, strange all. Even introverted people suffer tht. But, others said, ways keep contact. Calling, videos, texting, even keeping small social bubble others actually also isolating. 

It's isolating causing majority spread. well large gatherings. Wise decision. America jumped shark decades ago.  think Pfizer ran trial, design trial, quality collected data, key getting approval. Yikes. harsh truth is, friend going one day decide risks he’s willing take life. people vaccinated certainly lowers significantly. scenario life risk exist. risk much higher right now, cannot life understand people come say life now. Really? cool literally disassociating every relationship had? get stay pause long majority world decides move together. what? point become inconvenient focus risk realize you’ve literally lost everything worth living except.. still life? It’s really odd many people don’t even want look forward life different currently living US culture, good ill, still enormous soft ware world. Currently, ill. many spreaders almost risky. would never happen reasons. Amazing garbage turd like Trump gets help people actually saving lives die idiots calling shots. got it. That’s exactly is. that? agree more. can't old jobs. i'm losing temp one need figure pay bills eat, forget going get drinks. Sir Wendy’s I’ve ended longer running friendships I’ve learned actually cares doesn’t.

Not really. Australia New Zealand quite well. imposing enforcing lockdowns, think over-arching. Let's get Jon Stewart involved.

I live man, things tempt fate with... unlike summer spend much time inside less space less ventilation. could probably thanksgiving dinner everybody willing park never go inside. Maybe study, trial almost always paid. always mentioning “redditors” grumpy boomer way 

Who hurt angry add, pandemic brought discord server closer together. new social circle online friends watch movies weekend talk pandemic country nice. They’re intelligent respect scientific consensus COVID information. 

On contrary attended wedding August (yeah, know) uncle tried ridicule wearing mask.

Crisis always reveals true character people. Turning cruise ships death ferrys Well yeah problem now.

I emigrated 20 years ago. 

Best decision ever. fucking people ever learn? people already caught vaccinate get people immunitt vaccinated quickly? churches world behave this... Stupid.. Dude Trump hired literal white supremacist fucking speech writer talking deputy agency head like that's dude made racism happen. Yes - fully aware this. One reasons love Costco even updated mask policy week. cannot wear mask “medical reason” must wear face shield. Abbott's killing people - he's kicking dead bodies. He's making grieving families suffer ruin well. seems wash, going going down, hopefully truly Gallup suggesting Hey, libruls scairt fake ""virus"", cheap Black Friday trinkets me!  /s Except risk young healthy adults low. That's gotta interesting mix idiots psychos. Moderna trial get $2200. Thanks exercised months ... preventing harm happen asymptomatic. /s Sorry snappy. get it. year hard everyone. feels like half people taking seriously, half taking advantage efforts made right thing.  also important note study, UK arm, swabbed participants weekly caught infections including asymptomatic. Moderna Pfizer swabbed symptomatic participants. Given this, possible vaccines similar efficacy.  Gosh, finally happening seems. best thing it. developing nations madorna pfizer one expensive much tricky store especially pfizer one. see developing nations pretty much using oxford one reason offspring acquire virus immunity parents? live low medium population city things control. Last week lockdown stabilished hospital \~170% capacity right now.

The country general bad shape, we're heading towards huge second wave, since people 'getting used' virus ignoring social distancing things like masks stuff. There's lot hotspots get crazy next months. guy working CCP? actually trust fake numbers lol !!! one. Comes one's situation risk tolerance.

From individual aspect, waiting long possible get vaccinated often advantageous. However, general population, many wait, herd immunity take longer achieve.

It's balancing act health authorities. Rushing vaccines trying maintain level safety gives people confidence getting vaccinated early possible.

Personally, lack coverage Covid-19 vaccines U.S. National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program gives pause. Another reason wait vaccination longer likely should.

Governments need give people full confidence vaccines safe, including providing full injury coverage. Currently, U.S. government Covid-19 vaccines. One mostly own. Hoping changes soon, herd immunity requires vast majority population vaccinated. hard bit virus fault United States NYC takes seriously, physicians get paid poorly compared places middle country. There's large supply doctors here.

There might reconsideration future, making twice much regional hospital Oklahoma may worth it, means dealing goddamn idiots think part deep state. costochondritis, sounds worrying inflmation sternum. Lasted around 3 months flare again. I'm also flyover country. friends good, ethical business owners like that, that's great hope well. places worked, one place owned people things like commit wage theft, make us work dangerous conditions, cheat customers. know good business owners there, obviously, seems like hard find industries. get vaccinated like like Well, can't put ballot, much Wisconsinites vote fair maps matter suggestion... one WI GOP clearly ignore give fuck less people they're supposed represent.

I hope maps though, Evers veto obviously unfair maps legislature sends way, votes override veto. Karofsky surprisingly reasonable Hagedorn, really see WI Supreme Court overturning precendent allow legislature leave Evers redistricting process, rumored planning awhile back.

If ever fair maps Dems win majority, hope immediately make nonpartisan redistricting process law. Yes need people clean, take trash, restock supplies. also help nurses clean beds, bring food, maybe even lift someone onto another bed.

There dramatisation guy helps hospital Wuhan, pretty Part hospital capacity issues revolve around patients still testing positive, longer needing much medical care. live nursing home need rehab, can’t get stepped testing negative. need place patients go, instead stuck hospital needlessly mostly better. Im presumed positive February, essential worker, I’m talking politics. I’m talking spread inevitable, preventable, people realize downvotes show fear, denial, cognitive dissonance.

It slowed, cannot stopped. 

Fear not! Live healthy life style healthy balanced diet, exercise often, get sun daily, fulfill nutrition daily, stop bad habits, give body fighting chance needs. message authorities heavily promoting long time now. 

The solution is, become healthy severity lowers, survival rate raises, ICU needed majority. Unfortunately protocol probably adopted need most. Morocco. We're getting 10m doses two weeks. reassure you, people talk vaccine dangerous quickly developed it, often taking account fact lot people working hell lot funding usual, much urgent normal. might side effects sure, like vaccine, dangerous vast majority people affected. work indoor dining. worked 6/7 days week since march shutdown. People come resteraunt like crazy. owner's dont care, health department stopped caring calls, think one cooks wears mask whole time. Usually would slowed seems like everyone coming state vacation.

This week first week I've two days row two months since beginning this. coworker said hospitalizations going I'm looking right sources... /s think people New Zealand getting immunology lectures government something? hand textbooks infectious diseases South Korea?

Anyone thinks smart even least bit able take information analyze worth. Take NFL example gave. NFL player gets better COVID 3 days. healthy strong NFL player? No. information irrelevant you.

Not mention stories outliers. What's reported every day people dying hundreds US case numbers increasing hundreds thousands now. see people listening information, you?

I understand stupid people exist world get people like defending stupid people. Dr. Fauci, US' top doctor pretty much every doctor country well begging people wear masks stop partying. say perfectly reasonable people wearing masks partying ""mixed messages""?

Maybe turn fox news? absolutely correct. is. *Rolls sleeve* Let’s this. Uhh, live? that's strange unless live china. Shithole southern state taking me? That's works. get vaccine means unlikely get sick get sick much likely mild sickness.

Also herd immunity binary thing, every person gets vaccinated dampens vaccine's ability spread.

Lastly control close contact with. Everyone social circle said get vaccine long Dr. Fauci says safe. means 20 friends vaccinated I'm going worried house party them. Good point 'Murica!! people get 95% effective vaccines, know one 95% protects? make 100% immune I'm one 95%, give 95% chance catching potential exposure?

With number people refuse get vaccine, want know safe feel take it. matter testing antibodies vaccine given, ""Wait see catch it, people won't"" type situation? earth wrong society need news publish article ""Why want get disease""? mean? someone goes hospital unable breathe effects virus, get treatment, presumably outcome good. Trump DeSantis deserve go jail WAIT. USA STILL RUNNING CRUISES?!?? Isn’t shame. It’s they’ll refuse, it’s they’re going wait people get first stick arms them. Congratulations! Go Australia! like BBC headlined 'Trial shows Oxford Covid vaccine highly effective' hide 20%+ lower effectiveness compared American Russian vaccines. matter maturity, idiots going get people *killed*.

Thank this. also equally applies reservations new vaccines.

Of people know told plan get Covid vaccine initial rollout, almost every single one fully vaccinated also gets annual flu shot.

These people anti-vax. comfortable injection feel yet proven (with time) safety record. Tories charge NHS majority existence. OP sounds cranky. thought 1 million people vaccinated Sinopharm vaccine.
Also Chinese already vaccinated military.
I don’t think would risked military, getting vaccine think going fine wilfully ignoring possibility. 

New Zealand outbreak started family frozen food worker, covid free 100 days. still don’t take possibility seriously. implications global trade, it’s easier keep heads sand. Selfish fucker predicting 2-3 million confirmed cases AMerica Soon !!!!! True, however also likely dosage used practice. Even 70% though enough real good, particularly countries less facilities hold vaccines need specialised freezers. big win. u hurry up? revolution attend can't corona get frustration sometimes it’s still best try explain things people. degree genetics feel like I’m privileged position understand things work. everyone science background that’s ok, that’s it’s important try explain things kindly rather attacking like replies comment. It’s bit harder anonymous platform like reddit found there’s people changed mind exchanging comments (and even thanked taking time answer questions!) always try case. stupid question I'm wondering biological sense. happens someone inject three vaccines? Either time 6-12months? I've read first given half dose rather full dose 90% effective. looks like could even effective others Oof sounds rough. city major outbreak ? How's rest country doing?  raised extremely religious household get guilt feel external, chose isolate yourself. You’re forced quarantine. It’s important distinction, one authority yourself. control situation. choose isolate, choose go out. choices right right suck, get that, doesn’t mean lost ability pick best you. thank careful choosing place communities welfare high regard. It’s selfless thing do. family also decided isolate much possible. spouse work healthcare go work, distanced outdoor activities summer rates low area, decided lower community’s risk severely limiting contact others. Take care, strong decision made yourself. Welcome world health care. disposable Amazon warehouse worker. You’re laughing people want make life better failing due constant lies elite class? earth wrong you? 

How funny, can’t even understand mindset. Talk cut nose spite face. really hope natural, although month I've got nothing hope working much. Thanks reply! Also, one received vaccine needed hospitalization. So, prevent everyone getting sick, seems prevent vast majority people getting really sick. 

One biggest issues hospital crowding, vaccine would help great deal that. oh great another excuse Fat Americans. learned anything last 9 months deserve sympathy catch things we've saying time.

And people choosing travel week option to, fuck you. fun grandma's funeral next month. People like neighbors voted people in. one forced us vote people in. reality American people chose put people first place certain people continue support it. It’s already produced 8 different locations too. Pfizer Moderna swabbed symptomatic cases, Oxford swabbed regularly regardless symptoms, Oxford miss asymptomatic infections, Pfizer Moderna did. think quite likely equally effective, portion asymptomatic cases natural infection, Oxford could effective. Um...so waited 3 days respond. reason Twain said never argue idiot, they'll drag level beat experience. really bad communicating science, from? Check local universities courses communication science outreach, find pretty much Europe since one main issue fueling conspiracy theorists people ignorants certain subject. I'm starting think common mentality Florida recognize mortality. panic emergency happens. Storm coming? Let's board windows get sandbags ready. Bad storm? might need pack car. Virus going around? symptoms cold flu, get rest drink lots OJ. things get worse, see doctor.

They seem doom-and-gloom response prevalent regions. want go one step further...

Once done whole world take new look would take eradicate bug 3 diseases: Malaria, Dengue, Zika. I'd report every superior site, corporate, regional managers, social media department employer  Thank you, easy understand. That's Trump Strain. I’ll probably get downvoted mob mentality.

But think allowed express worry, get upvoted visibility someone explain reassurance people also worried see it.

Instead people worried shunned.

Just wrong guys, support sharing knowledge. vaccine originally developed previous strain virus adapted strain. **It conventional vaccine**, far I've seen

In addition this, higher lower dosage saw **zero** hospitalisations still caught virus. reduces destructiveness virus still massive win, particularly poorer areas vaccine likely (and important) deploy.

Lastly, 95% confidence interval results smaller dosage, despite smaller numbers, still indicate efficacy **at least** 72% (with max value 98%). almost certainly effective, regardless smaller numbers. really impressive, population size greater NZ city smaller Auckland.

In one showed giving people small dose vitamin-d (2000IU), prevented people (~99%) getting seasonal influenza. 🤞 Many people already Covid-19. them, there's even less reason get vaccinated right away. Also, many older people remember days Polio, Measles, etc, 1 200 whatever number, comparison, seem overly scary.

The science good information motives behind it. still early regards vaccine testing. many unknowns. understandable push new vaccines aggressively, danger loss public confidence, turns side-effects early trials reveal. would hurt vaccination efforts far long-run.

Most people going put much faith solely called scientific community, whatever is. Many cynical figure many scientists pushing government grants, bought, work big pharma, etc. Rather many individuals wait bit, seems like significant issues, get vaccinated.

Bottom line, comes selling general public safe effective; building confidence. There's simple way rush U.S.  definitely seamless could been, that's sure.

Would rather get covid? don’t know long term effects either. guess implement findings since Belgium deaths per capita country 1,000,000 residents. unlikely. Also true me. work big hospital owns half healthcare state. extra PTO bank use get tested work 3 days waiting result. Yep. lot willingly ignorant people believing negative test means don’t covid means got negative test. could still incubation period. test ever definitively tell it, don’t. published interim data, probably means another month submit data like Pfizer did. Add another month we’re talking Feb. Fully legal thanks businesses suing state. Can't technically prove got work. There's bunch horse shit like goes job. knew sooooo long ago. Trinity College Dublin study uncovered relationship like April. would go say something like this? fault goes sideways. good example data analytics “number crunching”. Running regression easy, cleaning data analyzing much difficult. requires in-depth understanding variables, well adherence understanding ethics. know must cathartic accuse internet strangers zero empathy, sound like walking trope BS.

check examine science based info: elect McConnell blood lungs leaving open actually true? Aren’t things well defined actual significance numbers statistics? significance number sample? Fine. I'll help you. 

[Here official news release full details One dosing regimen (n=2,741) showed vaccine efficacy 90% AZD1222 given half dose, followed full dose least one month apart, another dosing regimen (n=8,895) showed 62% efficacy given two full doses least one month apart. combined analysis dosing regimens (n=11,636) resulted average efficacy 70%. 

The n=\~3,000 effective dosing. whole trial 22,000 participants \~11,000 received vaccine. vaccine found effective vaccine regimes - two full one, half dose followed full dose, although latter found effective.

You may delete posts save embarrassment now. vaccines pork gelatin them? Asking allergies. Even so, surgical mask filter large droplets protect you. even end getting virus system, concentration determines sick symptomatic be, it’s better wear even 100% 90% effective. Even ever 70% effective, would still fantastic. means average person normally infect two others, average person would infect 0.6 people everyone vaccine. R0 0.6 means virus would naturally stop able find hosts. Well many already quit shit manager somehow got hired fired shit manager another hospital. I'm talking kindergarten level writing.

And every business mother sued pay employee contracted covid. makes sense call center work home. much er. Yeah, immune sense kind immunity vaccine may give. enough protection vaccine. wear full PPE work now, hopefully it’s enough. Imperial College’s mRNA vaccine costs $3, they’re charging richer countries order vaccinate poorer ones. They’re planning vaccinate ‘all people world, whatever GDP’. floridian. Fuck DeSantis.

Chris Cuomo! female correspondent - didn’t get name. :( Death rate lags behinds cases better understanding treat now, course death rates look better compared spring. Furthermore, death rates increase when/if hospitals get overloaded ration care (which already happening parts US, sadly, part Sweden's approach first wave, denying admission significant co-morbidities). Check back Sweden's deaths 2 months we'll see surprisingly death rate holds, 2 cents betting won't.

I get people love jack Sweden, they've done nearly bad US, countries want replicate like South Korea Australia. look deaths/100,000 population low current cases - works can't believe many irresponsible people bring virus visited family members, eldery, Thanksgiving. WTF! generally people get additional MMR shots completing standard series children. pregnant youngest kid 2007, tested blood discovered immunity german measles (rubella) disappeared really wanted get re-vaccinated soon born. Since rubella vaccine apparantly available itself, got MMR vaccine. 36 years old time, prenatal care delivery Indiana. haven’t read specific timeline believe Britain get first doses Actually really important. I'm hypothesizing wildly here, makes sense explaining eastern hemisphere much better fortune west countering this, despite enormous variety cultures, politics, geography. immune profile evolved deal spectrum viruses less similar corona. Combined hygiene discipline, enough pull R 1. hope botch vaccine delivery. use 1000 daily? enough? fairly big man 😬 type magnesium dose? supplements uv-b lights two options.

Maybe much expert. Wonder anyone going give Gavin Newsom shit this, they'll fine since he's Democrat overlord Website available Europeans... tell bar was? Maybe summarize article?
It's annoying Sun-Sentinel bother making site euro-friendly... (My home town Fort Lauderdale). used go cinema least every month.

Yup. major surgery remove half thyroid due cancer. months later hair started thinning falling like crazy due telogen effluvium. Thankfully severe one really noticed. months hair back, thicker ever. seeing ever becoming mandatory outside industry like health care. Public stand Bed capacity made aren’t enough nurses doctors staff them. China Vietnam become islands? Great Britain become land locked?

You’re wrong reality guy.

Also, Hawaii kinda blows island argument, don’t let imagination get way facts. think discount majority people followers. mean positive negative, usually act way align observe people act given situation. Hope Exactly. Damn Americans pesky desire free! sad many others conditioned think freedom rights wanting preserve freedom/rights ""selfish"" unusual considering correlation cold weather + covid work way think does. rewind time analyse Southern USA, Mexican, Pakistani, Indian outbreaks... hot weather still huge spike cases. results mean statistically significant p-values &lt;= 0.0001 then? figured results means 3 percentages Well thank efforts, least!  makes wonder place turn things normal. stay screaming void safe yet still literally killing grandma Applebees. patients made easier move around also many nurses doctors could moved states outbreak moved like texas Arizona help outbreak. everywhere, possible.  Thx, best Yeah that's long term thing. It'd take years, maybe even decades, build kind infrastructure countries present in, say, Europe. Yea I'm vaccinated probably awhile since i'm young adult, i'm going start going back normal life. point, providers decide get care. save 90 year old grandma 25 year husband father?

I envy anyone position.

EDIT: assuming staff. could build tents house patients well, patients need care. shortage healthcare professionals pandemic. feeling pain now.

It’s outdoors, keep distance others without trouble. 12/29/2020 canceled (yet?) http://www.blueoystercult.com/OnTour.html seems like people page strict lockdown we're talking here. original comment thread (literally) doctor dying stays home. essential worker bullshit

I've living Ontario throughout whole pandemic, definitely ""essential worker bullshit"" early stages. grocery stores (among things) remained open throughout entire pandemic? It’s elderly die. Although rarer, many younger people die too. among high percentage don’t, many remain ill unknown amount time due organ damage, including scarring lungs heart, well lots tiny blood clots. mention severe brain fog some. side effects could potentially kill many people years come. disease us want catch. lack empathy sickening.  Technically May still spring. I'll happy memorial day year normal. Nah, make companies enforce vaccine. 

Want continue employment here? Gotta vaccinated. 

Want get commercial jet? Gotta vaccinated. 

Want enter grocery store? Gotta vaccinated. 


In news, new business printing fake vaccination certificates launching next week. kidding! let’s stay cooped home ‘stay safe’ people go store, gym, drink etc day. It’s people packed smaller window.

If true businesses struggle hard every time curfews imposed.  here. soon risk vaccinated numbers start coming down, I'm going back seeing friends family removing personal restrictions.

Honestly restaurants bars first probably March. miss drinking breweries sooooo much. Looks like pretty standard stadium, drive in. Unclear roof retractable, late December Iowa can't imagine it'll open air. springtime, everything unknown. Fear high people didn’t really understand much it. People though going tear population quickly fear panic generally forced people cautious. Ironically, since disease much slower burn—it *spread* quickly frequent don’t see effects weeks later. we’re point it’s prevalent everywhere fear would actually much justified several months ago we’ve got people going “well haven’t gotten far bet won’t.”  why, least US, cross-trial comparisons allowed sort promotional materials drugs. Even similarly set trial vs placebo, still different patients, different circumstances (environmental not), different compounds. 

If want compare directly vs competitor, need head-to-head trial. Careful, mods going sniff ban ass. Lol. Maybe Christmas celebrate one long funeral procession state effectively going every state. Enjoy meal grandma week....get ready bury Christmas. Glad see still alive 2020 lol Ah, old chestnut. Ya, come exact opposite side you. Yes gives CHANCE come show normalize lunacy...but chance.

 crazies I've watched show almost seems like ""hang however much rope want give yourself"" kind show. Especially since conversation. ENTIRE CONETEXT conversation last 5 minutes last 2 HOURS right there. Come forward see yes, Alex Jones co fact nut jobs always believed be! Also important; come forward see someone like Bernie Sanders say 5 minute sound bite. sides equally important.

I see people believe way do, 100% disagree think exact opposite happening. think effective seems like they've mostly directed towards cancer before? proven effective far? Wow, you’re special kind dumb. “ICU’s cost money NO.” consequences.

""No one could known"" coming state near 90 days. Yea ok nvm see sit discussion. reason big hospitals rural areas population support them!!!!! Almost every top-rated comment post summarized following logic, rural=republican=bad.

We 4 ICU beds hospital 100% based population, political idealogy people would believe. Guess also have? Best Buy, chain restaurants, Trader Joe's, Target, list goes on.

Why earth would build giant hospital sat empty times pandemic? would make medical care even expensive.

I'm Republican I'm also way left. participate subs Republican could actually speak without getting downvoted. watch I've seen Fox News definitely divisive, trashy, pushes agenda. said find ""Reddit"" pushes left agenda hard top-rated comments often sound bites snarky phrases, ""where individualism now.""  find types comments behavior equally repulses left much Trump supporters push away right. phase 3 trials basically identifying people later hospitalized.

This totally false. every stupid Reddit comment get 1 USD.
(Yes, afford vaccinate whole world population.) late spring US back normal assuming vaccine widely available. nearly impossible make public continue social distance wear mask. Yeah, probably Government help citizens put we're working. Canada safety net. Lol even mean? may behind, better vaccine, prevail short months.  infuriating national coordination aggregation reporting sewage testing data.

This every treatment plant, every university, every campus based business office. data getting aggregated reported via publicly available heat maps.


(And someone invariably responds ""hey look, 'X' it""- yes places good job this. Particularly schools.  national coordination reporting want see) come anti-vaxxers I’m going call comment dangerous go back reading articles CNN. That's kind odd. I've mentioned medical technologist many occasions never stuff deleted. say miss family BETTER DEAD!!!!!!

Yes better alive make missing easier. Also entering lockdown nearby Peel Region includes cities Brampton Mississauga. last minimum 4 weeks worry time. I’m 40s I’ve got relatives ageing care, honestly amount money required *basic niceness* astronomical, reach point barring lottery win penning best-seller, roughly equal chance occurring. I’ve got choice, I’m currently thinking best bet time comes bunch morphine nice place nature, fall asleep listening world maybe get eaten bear something I’m gone. I’ll research making sure don’t accidentally poison whatever eats me.

I’m literally half-joking. seems preferable bottom-tier-of-*The-Upload* scenario likely faces terms care facility options. Unless country gets shit one sock next 40 years so, gentle nodding-off among sounds birds insects seems like best option. news, water wet. Yes, released deemed safe I'll take it, amount testing gone less normal vaccine. Long-term effects example can't tested obvious reasons. never wear one mandated government

Unless literally enforcement. Like $10 fine. I'm sure will. p-value percent chance results random, therefore tested hypothesis incorrect. p-value 0.0001 means 0.01% chance results actually random, meaning 99.99% chance stated efficacy levels correct. Generally, p-value 0.05 “statistically significant” meaning trust numbers true small chance aren’t. [This explains further. weird know band liberal, especially Eric Buck. made comments interviews across career sentiment song lyrics. Really odd would this. way Stop accepting transfers. 

Some hospitals last wave too... stop accepting transfers still serve community. would guessing values: that's study found. confidence intervals values shared yet, ""real"" efficacy could deviate fair amount found, continue trial.

Someone Twitter apparently claims [that able reverse engineer confidence found half-dose/full-dose regimen would 72% 99% effective based data released. see, still promising result, get data, efficacy might come quite bit. True listen armchair epidemiologists like mfbrucee kiwibattler guy. much reliable source information. understand emotionally people feel way businesses allowed continue unsafe thing unless government pays to? chemical company dumping waste river let say ""well give us bailout, stop we'll layoff workers"". California passed pandemic unemployment extension addition federal assistance. point public health take priority profit. maybe people trying get tested get negative go see families... building applications companies track vaccination employees. Yeah, aren’t vaccinated, aren’t going back office. It’s pretty straightforward. record can't stand Trump. said, ultimately every person gets make choice handle emergencies. different compare hurricane, wild fire, flood etc   Wonder many."" shit "" moments america needs There's 1MM traveler gap YoY month. like John Delaney's idea pay people $1500 get vaccine. get stimulus encourage people get vaccinated one go. Yeah know anything potential long term effect now. Half million Americans died Easter. Australia, New Zealand, china, vietnam close COVID free. Meanwhile, US, Great Britain, Belgium Mexico dealing record cases. common factor? first four islands, latter four land-locked. flat evil. care ideological implications even specifics who/how acquired COVID-19, actively serving active capacity kind public service, die even shadow chance killed caused employment, survivors COMFORTABLY provided day die, period. I'm sick government, insurers, unions, it, I'm tired reaping benefits pandemic, far increased government power largely uncontested power grabs would otherwise seen tyranny scenario, accepting death public servant unfortunate consequence related duties financially punishing survivors man gave life literally state, much. government serves itself, distinct impression elected officials cadres unelected bureaucrats best interests justifying likely unnecessary wasteful position, seek disadvantage directly impoverish single citizen virtue policy, nolonger reason motivation allow usurpatious entity continue granting consent governed.  Excuse me, that's barbaric. expecting there's kind justice dies thing, sadly mistaken. 

No, oftentimes person dies someone misfortune living household covidiot, taken care covidiot, ending grocery store line behind covidiot. Parents send kids school superintendent told safe, kids bring home them. 

It's sad, never vindicating. Idunno, feel like hookers financially secure, solid safety nets. bad feeling shits going get really real next couple weeks country. 

To quote Aesop Rock: “Rain dance unsafely, *brace supercell.*” still lot people parrot 'correlation causation' every time, get, but.... long going toxicity levels, there's zero harm supplementing vitamin anyway. get objections. ozone + spring water/mnt air cured tuberculosis Colorado. got exposed SARS-COV, left medical ozone machine running allow breathe antiviral. *Both applications meant ppl know got exposed need defenses body.

Pretty sad hard reach across people nowadays biased , rhetorical entrenched everyone world view.

As 13 + year redditor , like started redditing. engaging interactive conversations time. lost one huge circle jerk echo chamber another . Pfizer probably approved 10th. Moderna might request EUA week, might get approved 10th, too. Oxford bit behind that. Eh, that's we'll funerals Thanksgiving cases. Tl;dr:

“With combination luck, new hires creative reorganizing staff patients, Utah’s hospitals haven’t eject anyone intensive care units due coronavirus.

Do trouble reading? Premature celebration alpha-stage product barely passed review testing, based virgin tech. 

What could go wrong? People seen 99%+ survivable virus do. they've seen lives like spent cowering fear minute-by-minute basis.
 
And calculated risk/reward ratio values standard, necessary might say, human behavior potentiality contracting largely survivable virus. Asking someone who's unvaccinated mask distances equivalent taking rights away ask wear seatbelt. continue wearing mask case load goes let’s real—we know it’s safe again. cases going fall cliff two months so. Tell California, Oregon, Washington state mask mandates effect months yet cases spiking rapidly need shutdown indoor dining implement curfews. past month, pretty clear mask mandates *don't* work. 👎 [archive link anyone trouble accessing article currently control pandemic people resisting wearing mask, social distancing, traveling etc. somehow think willing wear mask social distance vaccine widely available? Sounds like hospital wants retain good employees, especially done. Smart move part. motivation endless doomposting? dont understand it. 70% &lt; 94.5%. Try again, please. also lot elderly people pressuring families gather. WTF, indeed. may trust trials reason, want see news outlets report mass side affects exactly. can't compare response US Canada's. Maybe denmark canada. 

Normal life already harder POC assumed system systemic issue pandemic would amplify towards groups. sad really. 1. Pharmaceutical drugs vaccines different things. mention huge amount eyes current vaccine studies.

2. common cold actually around 200 different viruses. bet one dangerous covid 19, they'd able develop vaccine it!

Vaccines cures. prevent infection. cure common cold, said, cure covid vaccines come out. So... sure point there.

We develop vaccines viruses. new. Polio virus. Measles virus. shock we're able develop vaccine covid. 

3. Honestly, argument explained ad nauseum. I'm sure know truth want contrarian, not, simple Google search give endless information flu vaccine does.

4. Like flu vaccine, protecting vulnerable. fair enough. least real reason. 

Seems think ""freedom"" whatever want take it. right deny vaccine, need spread false science around it. It'll depend.

Some selfish.

But others choice. Especially outside legal prostituion, many choice first place. makes sense. Carry on! need massive public education campaign safe. 

One heads research groups explained CNN day basically amount time given vaccine, it’s faster volunteers quickly red tape cut. instead phases results sitting desks months, reviewed approved quickly. could true. increase searches could people finally taking seriously wanting info it. necessarily bad thing. can't judge virus based data. seaches beaches parties yes.

Stay well &amp; strong.  anyone cares/is piecing timeline together. father law disabled vet 70, every comorbidity possible. doctors already scheduled early January Jab. Instead many states closed beaches parks trails transmission exceedingly unlikely. Reducing social contact good, hiding inside likely actually resulted people getting sicker.  actual cdc guides 10 days last symptom return “normal” considered contagious. Personally, understand someone feeling like adequate, though. It’s damn guessing game still. I’m sorry you’ve gotta deal right now. Good Literally professions mentioned open Nevada. Get clue Right. party doing, well, blocking stimulus packages...? *That wild shit man....so Grandma get hunt Elk camp?* can’t imagine must like leader history lying... incivility bots here, later man. probably groups, although difference person referring probably fully vaccinated unless home schooling many schools require vaccination records attend TP ladies

Uh what? Well Italy second oldest population world US around 40th that’s expected. family member sudden onset - like one second fine, next felt sick af - fever, severe body aches headache, nausea, stomach cramps, followed shortly diarrhea. assumed stomach bug food poisoning reading people's covid symptoms, really think could covid. sick maybe four days, longer typical stomach virus experience. fever would come go reached 101 highest, 99.5 100. vaccines usually 10-year trials. say will, know long term effects disease let alone vaccine. completely rational want first. idea shaming people cautious we're literally pandemic. us go work coworkers give shit? still stay home, huh? used bartend, briefly (literally got hired February.. whoops!) figured loved quickly everything got shutdown. makes sad friends say “the bar” like it’s satan’s asshole. Like get it’s good idea right yeesh, wanted career there! really hope stigma goes away shortly pandemic fizzles. Here's report excess long period taking 5000 IU day testing current level? closest came cruises Nope. Private hospital chain. don’t care anyone says, things become widely available, popular. Lots want get back normal. rest persuaded various ways. Think employment ramifications moment... send vaccinated employee important client meeting, send antivaxxer put business relationship risk?

The rest? Gift cards (I know people get flu vaccine Publix $10 card), peer pressure, yolo... name it. Pretty much. 

I plan get vaccine, I’m 23 healthy outside mild asthma., I’m overly worried getting (yes, realize asthma puts high-risk category, like said it’s mild know body better anyone else). 

I’m concerned spreading super-vulnerable groups. Yes, agree 100%. Schools area require complete immunization records specific shot requirements order enroll public schools. Thanks! That’s wanted. thought weird someone would post article wasn’t relevant city hand get annoyed someone would mention didn’t apply. People get really irrational points. 10-15% spread significant.  never lockdowns never will. Stay home, curfew etc enforced never  one Reddit answer this. blood tests doctor run answer it. must aware Nevada’s unemployment system runs rock chisel, judge away. fiance (who live with) exposed work HR department still told come symptoms. go hungry. musySt work VA lady desperate advance political career anything please Trump. bofoon. mulitple gatherings since mid july dundas square. Thousands antimask/vaxers.

its going every sunday while... idiots man. idiots.

people going travelling north toronto.. vice versa.. need portgual style lockdown.. parts city worst case loads.. segregated zones specific rules.. problem canada politician wants make choice since blowback top people. 10% decrease people traveling general.

The 50-60% decrease air travel only.

Edit - make clearer, amount people traveling anywhere Thanksgiving projected 10%, amount people flying destination halved. anti-science view. jump though large hoops get one exposed measles history showed one shot. It’s extremely difficult adult get MMR shot, needed doctors prescription letter CDC county health department get shot. Interesting chooses avoidance metaphorical-blood-on-hands situation justify actual-blood-on-hands course action. Canada would well within rights say, ""fuck you."" Sinopharm well, already given million people. trialed UAE (where live), Bahrain, Morocco etc. definitely rolled soon data holds up.

I really doubt Chinese vaccines work - reservation fact reviewed boards regulators developed countries apart China. Peer reviewed Phase III data good, would prefer level rigour. again, doubt China would sell key allies around developing world convinced safety efficacy themselves. majority states parents get waiver, simple one page form Pfizer missed asymptomatic infections

that seems pretty fucking ridiculous Yep. hand, much cheaper easier store distribute, make difference poorer countries.

Main talking points (imo):

* 70% effectiveness, 90% half-then-full two-shot dosage (as opposed full-then-full) although sample size half-then-full group (only 2 3 infections), vs 95% BioNTech's Moderna's.

* Low cost ($3, ~1/10 BioNTech's Moderna's) needs fridge storage transport (Moderna's needs freezer, BioNTech's needs -70C freezer).

* hospitalized cases amongst infected trial, unlike BioNTech's (but again, sample size ~30 infections 5 infections BioNTech's).

* (According comments) Oxford routinely swabbed participants BioNTech Moderna tested symptomatic cases

* (According comments) Oxford easier produce 3-6 months ahead terms production distribution, ~4m doses already available UK + millions need defrosted delivered, ~40m available + ~100m EOY India Here's ticket That's hot take. much ""right work"" that's union busting play, ""at employment"" gives employer POWER fucks every employee paid 6 figure salary. know US trials comes dosing? almost fit /r/nottheonion  surprised.

Look many embracing lockdowns, without questions. could see mandatory students. common schools require incoming students vaccinations diseases.  Thank you, perfectly said. entire family currently home sick covid. caught first responder husband picked work. family suffering continued working kept community safe. non mRNA based drug, going emergency approvals yet, lower efficacy (that still taking asymptomatic account, YET) collected samples tested all. cool.

I mean, could assume two mRNA based vaccines done way, except says article weren't. article also provide source so..

it specifically says article done testing potential ""paradoxical situation get much worse"".

That’s you’re seeing anger resentment thread. don’t see people rural counties passing mask ordinances, socially distancing, etc. Quite opposite. Plus, see transported hospitals right road us. 

In July hospital two miles away full. frightening. medical emergency? 

Are honestly saying wouldn’t feel resentment toward towners taking hospital beds? You’d fine someone coming thousand miles away take bed grandma could had? genius buys publisher paper publish misleading research.

""We found definitive link smoking lung cancer"" Hawaii actually recently issued mask mandate earlier month. partially Asian-skewed culture, mask wearing normalized back like April. businesses said wear masks come seen big deal. Beyond that, there's disproportionate military presence Oahu. Department Defense mandated masks buildings April, too.

Of course, Hawaii geographical advantages, too. everyone else move around country basically freely, quarantine period Hawaii much easier enforce list everyone coming state every day- one driving in.

This also there's really one wave Hawaii, too: August/September one. Apparently state gonna get 44k doses Pfizer month, whatever (the population like 1.5 mil something), disproportionate military presence get straight federal government. might another 30-50k itself, starts add up. lucky, state one wave. course, economy shambles... nearly impossible make public continue social distance wear mask.

I'm thankful though, Australia owes Victoria huge debt gratitude. We'd never expected it, US'd it, whole country would now. think frustrating part attitude enough people willing take vaccine, get benefits living world vaccine covid exists remain staunchly anti-vaccine call people ""good little sheep"" taking it. like teenager living parents' house claiming ""the system"" calling his/her parents fools working 9-5, yet live benefits system income parents earn 9-5 jobs.

Also, whole notion calling people ""sheep"" anything benefit society childish. people understand risks associated taking vaccine likely benefit assuredly benefit society whole. talk ""fuck freedom"" want feel free right isolated home. Sometimes freedom comes expense freedom another. useless apply notions like ""freedom"" public policy individual actions unless able demonstrate create functioning society. Good one, super applicable argument. almost convinced fucking idiot. think ""solution"" perfect - force people minimize higher risk activities.

I think majority people eating restaurants outdoors going start hosting people dinner indoors. Back time seems dim would meet people drinks dinner home meetups would substitute variety reasons. way work; geographically difficult people live over; 

At least Los Angeles weather still public spaces one meet besides restaurants one wants socialize safely (even without backyard). 

My original point acknowledging even theoretically safer outdoor dining remained higher risk activity potentially increased number people exposing others especially since one mingling one's friends large group people. Dude LA county. I’m sorry retarded? It’s 70 degrees year round. Americans hardon ""muh freedom"", new rhetoric ""I'm anti-vaxxer buuuuut"" sad see, especially pandemic.

True, means less points entry control, countries already infrastructure ability control points entry regardless whether people entering via land air. virus entered community, island completely irrelevant. could see still feasible. 

Kids far likely asymptomatic mild disease. One hypothesis could MMR immunity helps, waned less adults. 

Adults travelling countries higher measles levels often recommended booster MMR shot, even know vaccines kids (or measles itself) implying immunity wane. 

I don’t think anyone saying MMR vaccine stop getting covid. It’s quite possible number things (vitamin D, melatonin, MMR vaccines, etc) protect slightly severe covid, it’s much worth us confirming do.

The drugmaker AstraZeneca announced Monday early analysis late-stage clinical trials, conducted United Kingdom Brazil, showed coronavirus vaccine 70.4 percent effective preventing Covid-19, suggesting world could eventually least three working vaccines — supply — help curb pandemic.

The British-Swedish company, developing vaccine University Oxford, became third major vaccine developer month announce encouraging early results, following Pfizer Moderna, said vaccines 95 percent effective late-stage studies.

Oxford AstraZeneca said would submit data regulators Britain, Europe Brazil seek emergency authorization.

The company said early analysis based 131 coronavirus cases. trials used two different dosing regimens, one 90 percent effective preventing Covid-19 62 percent effective.

The regimen 90 percent effective involved using halved first dose standard second dose. Oxford AstraZeneca also said hospitalized severe cases coronavirus anyone received vaccine, seen reduction asymptomatic infections, suggesting vaccine could reduce transmission.

AstraZeneca’s vaccine expected come relatively simple storage requirements, would asset gets rolled out. company said anticipates vaccine require refrigeration, though provided details long temperature kept. Moderna’s vaccine kept month temperature ordinary refrigerator. Pfizer’s kept 5 days conventional refrigerators, special coolers 15 days, otherwise needs ultracold storage.

AstraZeneca said aims bring data studies vaccine conducted overseas Food Drug Administration — would mean agency likely review authorize vaccine late-stage data ready well vaccine works American participants. British regulators already conducting so-called rolling review vaccine.

“Today marks important milestone fight pandemic,” AstraZeneca’s chief executive, Pascal Soriot, said. “This vaccine’s efficacy safety confirm highly effective Covid-19 immediate impact public health emergency.”

Professor Andrew Pollard, chief investigator Oxford Vaccine Trial, said “these findings show effective vaccine save many lives.”

Yeah, everything's fine big vaccine everyone waiting Johnson &amp; Johnson's. One dose instead two, extreme refrigeration.

First saying work say course made gauze argue somehow makes article wrong....I talking MASKS article. Avoid reposts.  None information released.

Christmas: *Hold eggnog.* Given US public healthcare, still - presumably folks small towns private insurance hook whatever cover. like saying rugged farmers use plow rather buying tractor tractor made people big cities. 

Rugged individualism avoiding reliance government, people per se. Even Amish object modern healthcare.  You’re setting major disappointment. Immunity may lost. antibody blood work tests lost Mumps still 2. % capacity either full US state? see numbers people hospitalized idea what's normal, bad, catastrophic. mean treat people simple numbers, point people need ICU beds get them? I've hearing stories since July ""city X hospitals fill up!"" I've yet hear single one actually use triage see gets bed gets sent home die. Yes. Thank you. can't see real issue lack facilities poorer areas country. believe typically groups monitored 6 months normal (non-emergency) authorization given. gets murky scientifically want spoil groups ethically want get actually vaccinated. believe Moderna Pfizer included cases participant symptoms.

100% correct. Doubt vaccines anywhere close 95% effective. fair, setups I’ve seen allow decent amount space tables.  might make small dent. also...it going disaster many people industry. think lot people never lived large city (esp LA) realize exactly many mom pop restaurants are. Within 1 mile radius place, 400 restaurants. 400! LOT. many small business owners staff going losing money/making nothing right winter sets in. incredibly grim.

Buddy, ain't murder happening without *least* light brunch first. God bless America it’s sound epistemology, it’s got us first place. relevant comparison though. catastrophes happened system; unregulated. multiple large government groups multiple counties reviewing data. Jason Biggs fair enough :) Interesting take, especially since claims lockdowns proven hurt communities color more... I’ve got fever. cure cowbell would think rapid test would, given symptomatic previously. basing I've read around here. It’s pettiness. Trump administration helped delegitimize many once-trusted institutions. 

If vaccine fully approved election it’s unreasonable fear done political reasons. covid-relief legislation Republicans interested protects legal responsibility pushing workers harms way.  Yea we're fucked. problem deep seated too. need change constitution. prediction: 10-20 years (maybe more), default pensions receive federal bailout money pretense state constitution must amended make pensions system reasonable. We'll see comes true. Good guess field hospitals. overzealous cousin scheduled zoom 1-4pm, complete Thanksgiving scavenger hunt. translating guy said? Isn’t saying statement could made anything kills someone? something kills definition, without thing happening would live longer.

At least that’s read OPs comment. Maybe didn’t explain comment responded  (Don't Fear) Reaper. trying say? I’ll say biggest employer Massachusetts worked own, didn’t talk coworkers much. Might come twice, “it’s going spread here” way.  Muell3r report there's almost 4 full pages fucking Executive Summary alone summarizes Trump campaign's contacts Russians. need get propaganda bubble.

You also would need show explicitly states ""Trump colluded Russia"". Article headline literally reads CoronaVac deemed best. post headline says CoronaVac reports mixed findings.

Looks like someone like hear CoronaVac better vaccines. make 95% confidence interval three sets data, then? know control vaccine group relative sizes?  I'll tell sex worker friend mine. makes straight cash, benefits anything. legally iffy, never reported earnings taxes. 

Now, savings, obviously savings going last 6+ months. Unfortunately, ""didn't job"", technically lose job COVID, thus qualify type relief (not even regular unemployment). 

Also, ""didn't job"", big gap resume, people hire her. 

So, chose: continue sex work plague, starve streets. 

This empathy comes from. 

While outside may look hypocritical, want clarify point view: see ""losing fucking mind"" ""superspreaders"", ALWAYS people choice thing did. example, weddings (who wants remember fucking 2020 anniversary anyway?). Vacationing/snowbirds (like literally can't go ONE year without rich white ass getting tan Florida??), People hosting big backyard BBQs funsies, college students partying crowded bars lols. None required survive. 

I include ""people struggling pay rent break socially distancing rules survive"" list people I'm mad about. I'm probably wrong here, arent epithelial diseases commonly skin related? Would seem bit odd since afaik Covid effect it.

I medical biological background clear, layman understanding corrections welcome. keep voting red keep getting red policies. hard feel bad somebody embrace conservative rhetoric applies people  apply? Three family members didn’t attend party infected did.

This part people need understand. putting risk.  MN here, ditto us. spread control That's first responder voting Democrats. buy blue line b******* strongly they're willing die catchphrase opposed easily provable actionable items like providing financial resources getting spreading Covid. dose treating well, real reason change it- it’s pretty low considering US I’ve seen crazy unnecessarily high doses. work MIT memory serves suggested 300 mcg effectiveness sleep. said given likely helps little: that’s probably fine improving immune system too. (Just speculation part there) 250k people died u clearly glossed uncle coworker dying. u go check r/nursing. smart, witty, intelligent clever comments. ignorant. *‘Don’t fear reaper’*

Americans pushing 8-9 months lockdown/stay home. us working new conditions 8 + months. vaccines produced distributed overnight.

Some agencies telling people treat year 1 3 pandemic. hoping proactive cautious.  Overweight people. Lmao, suss account pushing pro revisionist bullshit.

This came china. refusing responsible citizen putting everyone risk. infringing rights freedoms fearful, selfish behaviors.

There's cost part society friend.

You refuse vaccine choose, get herd immunity, moving COVID era. directly standing way this.

Do part. know process things, anyone tell popping close together? family also believes Hillary Clinton ran secret child smuggling ring nonexistent basement pizza parlor. I’m sure think they’re right too. :)  think would line larger seroprevalence studies, treat caution. 

Also saying “far less dangerous” still needs look reality even lockdown year 5x many people died compared even “bad” year flu. 

What makes dangerous multiple - first - hospitalization time remarkably long compared diseases like flu dramatically increases burden resources - second - isn’t deadly, many people remain low symptoms - increases spread vulnerable populations. Ebola contrast much deadly - however doesn’t spread nearly easily people get fucking sick usually don’t leave bed thus don’t really spread it. *laughs New Years Eve party* Yeah, didn’t really come through. guess zero expectations commentators based lot recent posts sub others haha isn't. ""everyone looks indifferent others."" works because, well, everyone looks themselves. friends family, instead one giant support network everyone, millions little support networks personal specialized.  Hahahahaha Means: Much

In case commenting comment, think much merit messages downplaying usefulness mRNA vaccines I've read? friend mine said **Basically believe creating mRNA vaccine (a type vaccine never successfully used humans) work especially based antibodies known disappear specific Coronavirus.**  


I know enough subject opinion either way. also linked couple 4chan posts.  


To quote relevant portions very-very best, temporary solution. 
  reinfection occurs strains, especially bad news mRNA vaccine development means (surprise!) protection provided strains antibodies created original virus vaccine  


I thought I'd ask second opinion since prefer see sides accounted for. 4chan say lot shit sounds valid paper whenever floor themselves, actually quite bad sounds akin half-truth. Yes, suggest everyone follow data. Open google sheet excel doc follow areas interested track daily. stay ahead curve way.

Self educating key right - gov media... well, yeah. Anyway...

Google trends. Enter search terms shared. Play around timelines, click states, etc. I’ve mentioned, one day provide much insight. watching overall trends states cities states moving charts shows areas probably safe see start new wave positive tests.

I friends states/cities I’m seeing big warning signs messaged today. People get blood clots heart problems etc. way virus attacks body. vaccine attack body, hell think would cause problems virus itself? completely plausible all. also first, even close it. different vaccine trials around world hundreds thousands already received vaccines.

The problems vaccines cause fairly well understood usually present short term. Outside something like ADE(which signs covid vaccines cause), there's really instances vaccines suddenly causing issues years this, educate maybe fears around based ignorance lessen. Well yeah thats science works. data better. preeminent leader infectious disease spot every step way, trust one trust thus actively trying ignore facts contrary argument. Immigration right extremely hard costly. exactly cancelled Thanksgiving plans using credit trip pandemic ends. worth giving 1 holiday make sure spend rest together.

Considering worst per-capita case rates dakotas... think BFE intended effect. agree, one major concern children 12 (who work with) also weren’t clinical trials. hope maintain semblance safety population safely get vaccinated, I’m US feeling won’t happen. 2020 sucks doubt. Plants gardening soothing doubt. live Northern California pretty much grow anything it’s fun learn/plant fruits vegetables. two peach trees, pomegranate tree, many tomato plants, kinds peppers squash, carrots, herbs, different types lettuce...you name we’ve grown it. Fun kids also. 

My condolences passing father. stimulus certainly put good use you’re good son taking care final expenses. I'd next flight Amsterdam immigration easy. Well, treatment promising seems, that's alot lives saved. I'll take whatever good news point. way pandemic progressing US (especially considering post Thanksgiving/Christmas projections) we'll need every dose. You’re graciously assuming many rural folks insurance begin with. ones previously demanded individual mandate *requiring* insurance removed ACA. Exactly point. Luckily elastomerics pretty easy get reputable sites  Why? really helped mom (and me) feel better Thanksgiving together year mentioned I'd missed four Thanksgivings college, first year us. miss four jump back swing things, miss one. I’ve running searches since March. It’s accurate.

With greatest respect efforts, I'm hoping wrong. think are, I'm hoping so, going ugly.   Anyone worked plaintiffs law firm seen many times big pharmaceutical companies lie side effects, hide fact told needed warn people, paid FDA people (looking Johnson &amp; Johnson) could see trust levels people want make sure unknown long term side effects etc. 


Also Gardasil-HPV vaccine comes mind. turns corners cut, time testing/trials shortened side effects disclosed. wanting sure something safe long term makes sense.


That said different set circumstances many world's brightest working plus regulatory agencies different countries approve think less issues. 60% willing take even approved vaccine good sign.


Of course turns dick falls 6 months later outrage interesting. Got tested measles immunity going on. Zero protection despite childhood immunizations. Apparently issue doses people 40s. Got booster shot. Yep. Helping others makes them/us weak. former nurse, would say grocery store workers worse many nurses (the ones elective/non-covid care). They're close way people every day, usually good protective equipment monitored well, paid well rarely good health insurance. giving spoilers now? So, literally everyone looking someone else guinea pig despite evidence already suggests effectiveness. think another 3-6 months tell long term implications potentially faulty vaccine? Probably not. see results already seen past however many months testing. while, people dying ever increasing rate. read particular study likely broad research principle hand people aware of. Namely research expectation choose primary end points advance change different end point makes result look better. wonder happening (i.e. research thought higher dose would effective option geared research question accordingly stuck that) 1. It’s winter it’s going colder, many people put masks blinker stalks. 

2. People drive people vehicles. seats within 6 feet. $20 pop incredible cheap US drug, sad say. Ah, see we're already groomed next goal-post move. reports best sketchy treatment facts. one able verify it. Reads lot like “covid parties” spring didn’t happen. news coming 3 vaccines everyone comparing pros cons each, even get choose one getting vaccinated with, whether that's US, Europe, anywhere else world? Joy ride :) sure work hospital serves city rural communities. yeah, I’m okay job help people I’m employed help. I’m okay helping friends, family, community. otherwise would turn back values help anyone need.

I’m one areas country statewide mandate affects rural areas well. understanding efficacy low mRNA vaccines sensitive unstable. issues delivery method ruin vaccine. dangerous ""both sides argument"".

It's not, spreading misinformation like ""not bothsiders.""

Every vaccine taken gone decades testing. makers acknowledge risks can't? anti-science.  would require people stop stupid desperate enough go one reason another. Awesome! get this, pfizer, moderna vaccines I’ll 255% immune Covid! Welcome! NJ gets shit lot rest country, mostly memes. Property tax things aside (like anywhere), fantastic state 🌱 Could technology used make effective flu vaccines?   guys gonna lock sub sort time capsule virus gone (knock wood) Always smart compare vaccine time still thought women could trim fat vibrating belt 3 widely tested followed 2020. Bravo. Well comforting. Hopefully got enough sample participants account biases traditionally seen clinical trials.  What's crazy want pandemic end. Protest closings things, shutdowns. refuse one simplest effective things get life back normal. 

It reminds people abortion also birth control. Like sane person positions. I’ve running searches since March. It’s accurate.

Only last weeks things moving much quickly. New records hit daily searches. Always lines states/cities begin move charts, several weeks later report large increase positive tests, growing.

To really get data, track weeks identify trends. Good them, point frankly care people long affect me. Yes! People don’t understand nurses alike interchangeable. takes years become competent specific area. Prices Pfizer per shot 19.5$ (2 shots required). Cheaper Europeans governments financially supported development vaccin.

Flying also incredibly safe actual airplane due way air circulated actively filtered ever 2-3 minutes. 

Also, isn’t fact people increasing testing coverage good thing? want people get tested!

That’s say won’t cause spike. course will. ways safely travel without increasing risk tremendously. is, word “by” may mean beginning spring people... 

I’d expect normal Memorial Day long doesn’t entail international travel 3rd world countries I'm one get happiness going places too. helps get mind things happened life. sub pure scientism, great place real answers. Oh yeah, know. Even I'm fully vaccinated, I'm still going wearing mask cautious while, case I'm 5% effective for. shouldn’t. Vaccines always touted way this, they’re almost here.

Spring 2021 pandemic least end socially. healthcare system hopefully leveled anyone still needing emergency services able access them, point, need move accept certain (hopefully much lower) level mortality Covid-19 diseases. like spoiling wife plants toys cats enjoy laying couch playing video games. 20/20 showed us go anywhere anything enjoy ourselves.

They don’t get paid that, it’s advisors. closed bars restaurants Germany beginning November due rapid increase cases September October, we've still record numbers daily new cases past week.

If look [RKI absolutly see closing restaurants broke exponential increase.

Yes, numbers still rising slightly, need remember timeframes play: 

There 5 8 days infection first symtoms, days test-results documented. 

Another thing lot infections happen home. someone gets infected restaurant (5-10 days later) infects rest family. cases get registered another 10 days later.

Those restrictions actually working well, course private gatherings neglating lot. Yes. title vaccine justice. read, making initial dose smaller increases effectiveness around 90%. literally barely left house since March. baby family hasn’t met person. haven’t restaurant once. grocery pickup time. anyone everything right, it’s me.

Things would extremely dire nobody 'barely left house since March.' might doable individual sustainable society all, country anywhere advocating that. uncle whose mom fractured arm might need surgery. risk surgery significant he's even allowed travel back anything happens (despite willing get tested quarantine 14 days). really needs flexibility here, sucks ones willing follow rules screwed selfish ones aren't.

This rhetoric 2 weeks ago. 

I called April 8th federal stimulus apartment rental hotel markets allow folks sort out. Grannies moving together, essential workers hotels, shit like that. Hotels already getting federal support, mortgage bailout coming anyway. 

I think going smell normal '22. 

And miracle occurred: 2, 90%+ effective vaccines, millions already manufactured. looking like get folks vaccinated next summer. 

This absolutely changed everything. Hard lockdowns &amp; printing money make whole lot sense know next summer. 

50,000,000 Americans traveling Thanksgiving pure insanity. live always happened. nothing new! No, argument. Also, think worded analogy quite right. course much possible &amp; try stick online/delivery everything can. everything &amp; everyone sells things ships though. way easier earlier year though. hear fronts. We're hybrid right terrifies me. I'll also third trimester spring---just hoping enough people around me/in school get vaccine create bubble effect. teach older kids though.

I imagine they'll let younger kids get vaccine let pregnant women take it. massgeneralbrigham.org

Like many families, made decision celebrate Thanksgiving together year. 

We tired COVID figured would harm getting together one weekend eat watch football. family members visit far away [CITY], thought safe nobody showing symptoms.

We feel terribly guilty this, encourage families may considering Christmas gathering stay home keep family members safe. Listen expert, wear mask keep family safe. 2 months? arrive number? still vaccinating healthcare workers window. Try late Spring, early Summer likely. Hello! bring great points. appreciate perspective! okay wow everyone else, wear mask sheep people cities responsible rural people aren’t?

Wow. Take thing. Read confirmation bias, falling here. refrain posting miracle cures scientifically confirmed respected bodies. ton, mean ton, people know trying use negative testing ""all clear"" signal safely gather families. generally responsible people trying right thing spirit fully understand negative test implies.

I will, however, give credit small number people know actually using testing appropriate manner strict 14 day quarantine, take test *continue fully quarantine* receiving negative result. There's still risk involved, gathering relatively small include high risk guests, would acceptable way (other gathering course). Everybody expert ....on internet. get point. would unlikely fluke though. people protesting lockdowns tend people dying COVID. Nope assume that. That's also article comment about. April ish? That’s little sooner thought. expecting like August normalcy return May means we’re halfway thing. think like that. Thanksgiving going really throw shit dumpster. used adenovirus vector based vaccine before? examples? think lot people realize this... ICU capacity cascades.

As fills spills neighboring areas. fill spills further.

Eventually entire system overwhelmed mention less efficient since patient need might far nearest available ICU bed.

This doctors call ""December 2020"". Whoa now, ""poorer countries""? dont think so, Rich people first, dowhill there. If, left alive, maybe might benefit. Living America, done, left racist part helping poor.  Seems pseudoscientific, confirmed anything all, please refrain spreading misleading claims reconsider sources reading.

Not mention thousands dollars debt average American would face ICU length time survive this. (And that's well insured!) heard coworker ICU now. He's actually independent contractor working company, he's self employed. wife got it. due released soon, think he'll ICU another week two. Welcome March 2020 take epidemiologist know hospitalizations lag behind cases week two, deaths lag additional week more. 

If wait till hospitals full respond already late. California knows example, deaths still decrease implemented stringent rules regarding dining schooling cases going statewide. 

You can't wait hospitalizations increasing, rocket science.  aren’t even locked down. I’m sure protesting. probably ask /r/covid19 people actually know shit. say lot shit sounds valid paper whenever floor themselves, actually quite bad sounds akin half-truth.

/s sister NICU doctor getting the/a vaccine next week so. Any* that. really. group gatherings literally problem. matter county thing happening, spread happening public places multiplies home. spread multiply. Mid spring realistic estimate according professionals. wouldn’t released general population wasn’t deemed safe. Sure, don’t know 100% certainty (which nothing meets standard) long-term effects regular adults, *but* evidence far implies *unlikely* (no specific probability mentioned) severe negative long-term effects, usually start presenting way early hasn’t observed.

So it’s say isn’t evidence supporting lack long-term effects, definitely evidence support that, it’s simply evidence isn’t certain yet hasn’t enough time/data.

The question becomes, greatly increase risk contracting/spreading virus killed million people globally *known* severe long-term side effects getting vaccinated? greatly reduce chance contracting virus, including milder symptoms still happen get it, expose vaccine thus far resulted mild cold symptoms unlikely severe long-term effects?

Unless fall special category (e.g. pregnant woman, small child, rare genetic disease, etc...) think answer objectively obvious choice safer. shit! Fuck! Sorry, big unknown. depends fast vaccines deployed large enough percentage get them. Spring seems pretty optimistic get level distribution would need, knows. But, aren’t going allowed office setting without mask enough people vaccinated covid numbers down.  That’s reality. concern ""piles dead bodies"" long-term side-effects would small enough make distributing vaccine good public policy bad personal decision some.

&amp;#x200B;

For example, assume vaccine 90% effective causes long term paralysis (or whatever serious ailment want) 0.1% use it. death rate Covid 0.4% average, would reasonable public policy continue vaccine. low-risk group (say, 21, not), might prefer 0.02% death risk 0.1% paralysis risk - what's more, everyone else takes vaccine, to.

&amp;#x200B;

I afraid authorities would doom many money, concerned may opt play god lie. Like early on, said ""n95 masks would help general population"" wanted discourage general population buying them.

&amp;#x200B;

For reason, probably wait round 5 vaccine distribution opt take it. stay distant wear kn95 months longer. We're going die?

No zombies, huh? clickbait titles. People working home condescendingly tell ability pay rent doesn’t matter. mention employees restaurants, least experience, tend masks properly (if all). Nevada theyd independent contractors. understand that. forget must literal thread times everyone loses minds sorry! follow distancing masking protocol party? outside inside? inside, sort ventilation there? There's lot important information missing here. pandemic would've little hesitant take vaccine took 1 year develop. research techology used take immediately available. think what's going happen lot places make mandatory (airlines, cruiseships, sporting/music events, maybe even employers). think see anti vax crowd widdle quickly see everyone else living life pre-pandemic. that's hunch. US going hit 400,000 deaths, feel it. holidays going slow-moving disaster vaccines widely administered. Like Speed 2, less Sandra Bullock bullshit COVID deniers. Don’t self isolate uk? Can’t see Americans abiding that. can’t home let alone country  thing I'm excited about. people get severe forms, lifts pressure hospitals health services, main reason lockdown first place. 90% people going see headline, avoid comments, think, ""Well, Oxford vaccine sucks!"" 9% people going go comments think, ""Oh, half dose great Moderna Pfizer."" 1% people probably realize really need wait see data vaccines making conclusions. 

What’s average to? I’m sure they’ve dealt anything level specific ethic committee- I’d assume works similar triaging patients emergency. Figure needs emergency care focus likely live focus resources them, there’s limited amount.

People aren’t immediately dying wait longer oxygen ventilators there’s enough. people nonexistent chance survival may pulled ventilator earlier normally would put someone who’s likely survive it.

Doctors don’t care insurance, won’t make difference there- uber wealthy probably better chance solely easily set medical facilities homes, everyone else dealing hospital.

There’s really time ethics boards committees anyways, decisions made incredibly quickly, people take turn worst fast.

It mean we’re likely start seeing lot deaths been, people otherwise chance survive won’t able get amount focus were. Please argue points next time brandish friends' merits instead. idea experience Brazil?

Yes, i'm Brazillian. 


In town cant get tested want to, they're testing people moderate symptoms worse (mild cold-like symptoms like headache sore throat get pretty much ignored patients told stay home 3 5 days, prevents nothing), including people got contact confirmed COVID cases. feels like they're purposefully underreporting covid cases avoid lockdown measures cases get high.

Still, virus widespread enough significant genetic variation, far enough impact vaccine effectiveness. ""mink mutation"" showed 15% resistance antibodies, scientists said concerned thus far. good news! 70% average efficacy rate won’t enought create herd immunity lift restrictions. Unless 100% population gets shot, don’t think likely. hope UK get doses russian American one too. actually huge question mine. example already reverse engineered HSV virus (Herpes), say might take years complete vaccine. new advancements mRNA tech, thinking, breakthrough start trickle across finding vaccines previous un-vaccined diseases like herpes, AIDS, etc. contextualise, greater efficacy normal flu vaccine. it’s far cheaper vaccines. distributed far easier vaccines useful globally. Poopermache One million week... Jesus. November climatic scene election lots vaccine news coming out, December starts nice happy aftermath period things start get resolved.

On Wednesday last week, government decided mink Denmark slaughtered, mutations covid-19 found humans spread mink.

However, since emerged government legal authority force non-infected mink farms farms located within 7.8 kilometers infected mink farms slaughter mink.

That government submitting bill. Previously, plan implement emergency law Tuesday. abandoned government putting forward general bill.

Whatever good wishes country, countrymen contrary common-sense. can't help feel guy... Interesting, tackle lower efficacy rate? people gonna get also shot vaccines later spring? take 4000 IU/D

Guess amount taking consumers wiping surfaces?

yep rally side DC recently. Photos available online. masks, ones pulled down. district kids offered remote option (which wife opted for) required masks in-person learners entire school day. result nearly zero transmission within schools. 

So, reducing density adding masks helps things reopen safely. novel concept, know. school healthcare worker well prepared mentally deal things.

Italy Turned Around Coronavirus Calamity**  stumbling start, country gone global pariah model — however imperfect — viral containment holds lessons neighbors United States. first 30% overwhelmed hospitals, second 30% definitely will. would last day office even try cut $11M per day military help Israel sure, think made argument BSE would assume US would take majority of, all, supply chain considerable amount time due population size. AIUI (and needed ELI5), possibly due vector used delivery people getting immunity means immune system can't ""learn"" COVID virus ""tagged on"". vaccines take long develop test due lack funding. covid vaccine given essentially endless funding. Omg family getting together say “last thanksgiving” thing. It’s dumb. likley vaccine next year. need hold one year! I'm going anywhere. I'm going keep fighting make country better. love America right shithole need massive policy change. get two vaccines, would cover 100%? home residents staff, healthcare workers - beginning December;

On selfish note, hope includes assisted living facilities finally get see mother Zoom call! course iv heard herd immunity wtf??? Thats end goal everyone. I'm talking people saying Sweden herd immunity strategy. almost started sounding like people think discussing herd immunity = herd immunity strategy, mfbrucee fellow doing. made clear. Time paper mache' project! point would choose mRNA ones Oxford one remote possibility triggerring demyelinating events based two cases MS. think general, people able make choices like increase amount people wanting get vaccinated. I've ""looked china"" guess what, they've state capitalists since 80s. US absolutely ""torturing murdering people like"", unless completely ignore people dying ICE camps multitudes state sanctioned murders police carry every day. plenty people jail shot cop illegally entering premises unannounced. give shit happened you.

Why cops kill, will, called justice person defends home unannounced, unsanctioned intruders crime?

If gave shit US citizens' rights would realize founding fathers fought standing army ready murder civilians, exactly police force become.

Did know police literally trained shoot kill thing perceived threat, trained perceive almost everything threat? constitutional obligation serve protect fact established courts. protect private property capitalist class.

Scientific consensus says we've already waited long mitigate catastrophic climate change. 100 percent chance devolve chaos find way produce clean energy, something oil lobbyists fought decades.

For someone claims wary evil ways ""communist"" China cleptocracy Russia, pretty ironic support mechanisms maintain power. America course end just. Like. Them. 

Again, change course, doomed. Time pull boot mouth fight justice. That's NZ hotel quarantine, arrive country go quarantine certain hotels 14 days. course there's couple leaks, mainly working every vaccine announced effective distributed according expectations, 15-20% Amerincan-European population could vaccinated every month starting January. means end April could easily 60% immune, herd immunity setting risk population already protected, rendering deaths 1-5% now. Pls. kill optimism :) term thinkers. give fuck costs who. ""how much gain this"" local news comments sections already outraged mostly GOP politicians contracting covid believe Dem plot. usually untrue immediate dollar cost lower hard analyse cost benefits lifetime. goes many projects IT. Sure outsourcing costs less service worse wait times grow costing company much lost productivity incredibly hard analyse. 

People thrive give much back costs keep well. US UK probably first vaccines (obviously China far along ones BioNTech Germany they're probably fast timeline also) take little shipments arrive Canada. fact things tend move slowly (and incompetently) Canada. light commuter rail extension city delayed times stations route. definitely unless clinical tests, scale seen vaccines themselves, conducted first. Australia did. RED pilled cases hospital moment.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  That’s college lecturer I’m taking grading easy year. Students enough deal with. Part job protecting pedagogically suitable way. think one others requires 2 doses too. remember reading UK bought 40 million doses, equated 1/3rd population 2 doses required. want everyone else adjust feeling ""gross"" them? feel bit entitled? go among people then?  ""Everyone's selfish moron, guess be, too!"" sound like joke starting three days 

When Sweden switched feet left hand traffic right, orderly way...

Cars first day

Then trucks buses three days later. Like 2 Weeks later Shithole state. know, lived way long. Sad sous vide noises.  mink North Jutland (place cluster 5) culled.

Farms infected mink mandated cull herds elsewhere country well every mink farm 8 km radius.

It illegal mandate culling non-infected mink outside this, mink farms continue voluntarily. lot testing. Helps explain total reported deaths Covid less half last week. open waffle stomping, bathroom's capacity people pooping doubles. 

It's simple math can't ignore 100% efficiency increase.  I'm sure businesses mind chipping pay tests make sure employees coming sick spreading disease owners, upper management, paying customers. Many may even willing test customers meant protecting owners upper management staying healthy, getting customers door. Show offs. imagine catch it. they'll laughing asses family invincible covid. Looks like old fashioned way kiss covid patient. Democrats complicit too. (Australian) fucking hard? town hasn’t cases don’t know anyone covid, rough time limited travel state state it’s managed. We’ve dealt restrictions social distancing even without cases it’s it’s problem Wait, around 1.5 billion doses three vaccines worldwide April? Try reading article It‘s seriously underreported many first responders paramedics suffer consequence jobs. tragedies see, inadequacy feel, guilt, pain.

And shit like happens. handled human beings trained reduce costs, aside appeals. unbureaucratic, automated process, err side leniency.

Seriously fuck greed pennypinching it‘s heroes. Half country already stopped giving shit. personal behavior matter face 100 million morons. hate state 

I grew Utah.

And I'm one feeling sorry *for you*. underestimate ability tens millions Americans convince getting tested several times month worth time, effort, cost. Especially accurate test around.   think vaccine mandated much common masks. invite level controversy overall opinion hardcore anti-vaxxers Try reading article making masks surgical gauze/cheesecloth. course work. think today's masks work, next surgery have, tell surgeon nurses assisting want go maskless.  See tell ya. lol r/COVID19 else bail medical insurance industry, seems like waste pay federal funds third party rather pay doctors hospitals directly

DINGDINGDING Exactly, violence prisoners makes worse. think people become litigious getting infected dealing complications, employers might make requirement Also, study specifically reported findings independent pre-existing conditions. Perhaps, globally, COVID-19 deaths stagnating last days, perhaps start see reversal already next week. Here's latest case/death charts interesting, usual spike cases, Utah's death rate remains low.

They're currently 24.93 deaths per 100k population - 1/3 US average. ranks 46th among US states per capita He’s still waiting studies elk meat eggs send presents regards time around think jobs require full time benefits regardless hours worked. Amazing actually incentives offer full time, rather reward employer keeping parttime. get's decided State Gov Healthcare policy experts, local regional. There's one set standard guideline nationally. there's free travel provinces/states

But wasn't. Like said: misinformed. Provincial police guarded provincial borders allow crossings... even bridge Ottawa Gatineau barricaded. Provincial orders enough Canada Canadians live Ontario Quebec subject Provincial mandate, respective Premiers (for part) worked tandem application enforcement. Watch everyone /u/PM_ME_YOUR_ATM_PIN here, u get hacked Also thousands people gotten already. It’s like untested never used human Curious get verified? 

Second rarest symptoms you’ve seen far? reading people clotting capillaries hearing loss. It’s strange illness!  seen [Norwegian Cruise lines starts something like, “Dear 2020, time” Queen’s song, “I want Break Free” bursts shows maskless people happily prancing around world dining friends. It’s astonishingly tone deaf. dont see per capita deaths comparing Europe USA? injecting patient nothing saline 0% effective, bringing average 35%.

I'm confused took average two regimens , stick ""one dose"" regimen (that's actually one half) , 90% effective? Jesus. considered burning down? maybe part management  Umm, Pfizer stated start vaccinating people within hours approval, still idea approved, since December 10th meeting wont actual day approve it. sitting arguing going help anything. obviously, people choice. likely exceptions. Well, silver lining Trump would let feel virus big deal. Astronomical increase Sweden cases death rate surprisingly low. 


In New York, like Quebec, 80% deaths nursing homes governements states reacted widely. needed focus people really needed help. Closing schools gyms idiotic. Care explain Walking Dead reference everyone? Would still take least year immunize everyone, probably last long. far over. Still, 130 people way people make generalizations larger population. really made short-cuts push vaccines through.  interesting Los Angeles county - comparatively speaking -better areas. They're currently 73.74 deaths per 100k. ranks #1,155 among counties per capita deaths. Here's latest charts Los here's list counties, ranked per capita think you’re sure everyone high risk vaccinated thus won’t severely ill let run herd immunity reached. salmon matter. However, often abundance sun. scientific boards I’ve read saying good portion old people vaccinated normal young people aren’t concern It’s two doses No. vast majority are. immune? thought myth. People gotten covid once. virtual therapy 

Do know hard child low self esteem talk FaceTime zoom issues? miss home community clients pressure environment melts away around fun whatever game bring. can’t bring games know sad play board game move stare screen? need vaccine sooner later work alone countries would top 3 mortality rate per 1,000 per capita rate. 

Way go North Dakota title PLACE wants. pub boxing day footie? Count IN. Thank insight. helpful. Thinking back past, spot many common vaccinations series.  funny since comment chain yall information highlighted says pointing missed reading full article. bad, rejoice news vaccine like will

*What life without brief moments victory?*

S\ sure live United States, would take measures control COVID day week. Sign up. I’m happy first it’ll help people feel better taking it.  clinical presentation disease. detected SARS-COV-2... virus.

Come people! Without wanting sound rude, non-American, speak global sense, think entire world country apply thoughts based n fact. plenty countries price point ease distribution key, fact probably countries.

I've doubt America roll whatever vaccine produced company decision-makers hold stock in. Yeah there's way leverage positive way. Japanese pensioners volunteered go radioactive zone Fukushima help, knowing futures already short, order spare many younger generation possible, much longer futures ahead them. Oxford vaccine, price around £3, also costs far less Pfizer's (around £15) Moderna's (£25) vaccines MAIN thing. cares 30% vaccine fully protect symptoms going light ? Keep trying.  I'm much older millenials. Almost every place I've worked gone. ok now, rough times. hospital. Covid, pay 80% usual paycheck return. Sucks hospital doesn’t offer this. send kid city they’ll come back blue hair neck ya. Airports quarantined start, period. Borders ports entry place US national government constitutional authority enforce public health.

You're preaching choir. know current constitutional/legislative framework sufficient USA handle pandemic options available never even attempted. concern isn’t immediate short-term side effects. It’s ones appear months even years later. former movie theater manager say ""diet replacement"" theory active one. 

Tub popcorn cooked coconut oil, salts, doused butter, pair Diet Coke. used folks hit button many time earnestly watched. like rats science experiments keep hitting pellet bar get another hit painkiller point overdosing. 

Some created ""heavy bag"". sort popcorn bag much butter laden whole thing weighed down.  used one semi-regular man would come actively request ""you put enough butter make sick"".  first time personally thought enough. Dude came back set bag gave little speech much likes butter take much could put there. grabbed carrying tray catch leakage put close half gallon satisfied him. It’s CPC yeah incredible job. 

If you’ve never China it’s hard imagine sheer scale cities there.

They 16 cities 10 million people. 

They 100 cities 1 million people.  think last virus see? last 20 years gave us SARS, Swine Flu, MERS, Ebola, COVID-19. Epidemiologists say prepared even common outbreaks. main comment chain replying even says ""important information miss reading headline"" goes explain effective needs half dose full dose month later. point everyone make excuses travel. Thanks elaborating! Though agree appreciate input.

The fact communication confusing contradictory enough local official also believe following herd immunity strategy reinforces point incompetence mismanagement: FHM's communication made people various levels believe following herd immunity strategy. opinion talking going towards herd immunity (both media internally), talking stop letting slowly spread society, talking keeping school opens help us reach herd immunity faster, publicly making guess guess, incorrect, percentages people immune soon we'll reach herd immunity, etc, speaks government's blind bet, least spring, herd immunity.  


Herd immunity vaccine context discussing - rather mentioned would *very long time* get vaccine.

They release whatever official strategy want great strategy *now*, saw first hand idiotic deadly idea pre-vaccine herd immunity is, months internal external communications talked aiming herd immunity, article ""official strategy"" merely another notch adding numerous contradictions.

I hear book written strategy. sure side debate on, look forward reading hope cover objectivity. Makes think bus drivers' strike years ago when, instead refusing provide public transit, drivers refused collect fares idea people love trans-Atlantic cruises, drink much one day. Wow, that's soon amazing even possible. Guess really time start working covid weight case! Fuck, brother residency there. lack mask mandate current state affairs astounding. 50 years we’ll look back horror many people died reason everyone little piece cloth covering face. Borders ports entry place US national government *constitutional* authority enforce public health measures. Everywhere else, make suggestions.

What next, strip remaining scraps authority left national government manage pandemics? called denial. turn around first ones demanding hospital bed either loved one. soon plan. volunteered trial another trial. I'd love optimistic unless virus going gone completely January, feel there's good chance may LOT deaths then. guy seating next cough directly Good news: absolutely love see it. article olympic level runners mentioned without mentioning drug protocols guys running. Even state level insane. course hit hard COVID. call bullshit smell bullshit, believe NY times. Stop per capita numbers, difference population big (eg USA vs Switzerland) comparison pointless. one comparing France Belgium San Marino Andorra; USA must compared similar countries.

Also, 1 life 1 life, value country. 1 life one country means 0.2 another country. concede

Unlike someone.. look developed countries don’t think anyone would willingly choose AZ vaccine two. think speak volumes ‘good’ one is.

It’s also pretty sketch base approvals subset analyses. N 90% group relatively low. hope holds trials. gaslighting fucking sucks. family us too. Indeed, Florida isn’t even top 10. Sarah Gilbert said something similar today - they're going look detailed data soon. entire study 20,000 people, 131 infected Covid, we're talking small numbers here. 


I see breakdown cases half + full vaccine group, made 15% study. cases, unclear 90% vs 62% efficacy numbers even statistically significantly different.


Probably better report 70% efficacy point, statistically sound, get people's hopes 90% efficacy, could statistical anomaly based small sample size. So, make good point, lot people already it. shortcomings medical trials well documented past (biases race sex, two examples). think people see safe, higher participation be. here. I’ve one drs appointment, two in-person meetings, masked outside. near beach none adults kids masked. People fucking stupid beyond belief Well extremely dubious finding, light usual dosage response relationship medicine. remains unexplained would cast doubt entire trial IMO. Oh definitely educated better sticking non-processed foods. limited budget got, able subsidize groceries 18 months money got put card every month doesn’t go away. quality control there?! thanks. Except we're talking NATIONAL level quarantine provincial. there's free travel provinces/states, alone enough spread virus. data widely sports-blogger-turned-Uber-driver

In words, failed sports blogging... much. 10k rarely causes issues. want extra safe also supplement magnesium role vitamin innate adaptive immunity critical. statistical error estimation recommended dietary allowance (RDA) vitamin recently discovered; correct analysis data used Institute Medicine, found 8895 IU/d needed 97.5% individuals achieve values ≥50 nmol/L. Another study confirmed 6201 IU/d needed achieve 75 nmol/L 9122 IU/d needed reach 100 toxicity observed levels 25(OH)D serum level 200 ng/ml (500 nmol/L), toxicity observed studies reporting daily vitamin intake 30,000 IU. imagine going stop elective surgeries point. would least free supplies staffing up. 

It really sucks elective surgeries aren’t cosmetic surgeries like facelifts boob jobs... quality life surgeries like hip replacements tumor removals.

Ducey needs statewide mask mandate enforced. needs shut bars, churches gyms. needs communicate public often every three weeks rather relying social media word mouth. Dr. Fauci repeatedly said food worry asked. mean cooked food? Probably. Yeah ok. Still amazing, real game changer stopping spread. Forgive probably naive question, could vaccine one world gets immediately, months line greater risk could get effective mRNA vaccines well? wondering North America implement COVID response like China, locking 17,000 people will

Because preferable mass superspreader events [like every airport following Trump's travel bans one bothered plan logistics.

Airports quarantined start, period. Borders ports entry place US national government *constitutional* authority enforce public health. little, late! one work talking it? can't imagine single industry affected. Even 70%, that's threshold believed required herd immunity COVID-19. cheaply distributed everyone population, may enough. understand save lives maybe don’t prevent infected contagious awful human being. That's say. push back, snap, debate, etc.. hospital completely 100% CNAs. Like CNA floor all. job full time CNA shift well.

And they've cut everything. mean literally every benefit except health insurance. 401k contributions gone. Overtime extras gone, overtime pay multipliers gone, raises gone, promotions gone, staff received pay cuts, depending week/floor forced furlough. Oh yeah, educational refunds gone.

At point best sum getting basically base salary/hourly rate * percentage pay cut * hours give per week + health insurance. Everything else gone. Chicago going rate someone come clean apartment higher paid nurse masters degree.

Personally, bad essentially paying money pocket stabilize nurse able work hospital. right now. seriously. I've waiting Covid deniers, Trump bootlickers across street get it. make several trips day local liquor store, smoke like Phillip Morris stock, obese. Every cough hear across street gets hopes up. look bill gates. almost shut anything positive country. republican groups actually hate dismiss him. people keep flogging dead horse? explain high death rates Latin American countries MMR vaccination extremely common? One arguments precisely difference eastern western Europe, kind sounded reasonable spring anymore vaccine isn’t rushed though. negative many cases covid agree extent. think lot people okay outdoor dining enough experts said okay, said, ""fine, restaurants allowing outdoor dining--let's meet place instead!"" lot would totally cool that. Also...92% LA rents, believe. people capacity hosting large outdoor dinner parties. Solid answer! I'd like add MacGyver- ing things up, cause redneck engineer really something special! Notice say good...just special. Vietnam shares border China pretty much 3rd world country comes medical technology. able clamp contain virus educating populace first second caught wind it, strong coordination national level local level.

If Vietnam it, supposedly greatest wealthiest country world able too. muh freedoms crowd can't bothered inconvenienced one event occurs every hundred years so. Make feel proud British, vaccine costs 3 quid works bingo. read way first tell do, i'm poopin shower cleaning toilet. did. grew there. public children's science fairs children prohibited displays dinosaurs lies devil. people oppose science, medicine, evidence, logic. True enough. wait phase three results making decision. could guarantee they'd last line Excellent news, particularly bit: also crucial advantages make easier use. stored fridge temperature, means distributed every corner world, unlike Pfizer/BioNTech Moderna vaccines, need stored much colder temperatures.

That make difference. Probably one end getting. Nothing see here, everything's pictures released testing appear show orderly, calm videos believed mass testing show officials hazmat suits corralling large, yelling crowds restricted videos since disappeared, state media reported chaos, saying 16,000 people tested Idiots I'll miss guys also fuck hope never see :D Cancelled trips votes, Merry Christmas. Yet, cop kills innocent person violate someone's rights, keep benefits, job, stay prison. shame too. true. heard viruses also. guess cargo pilots human, like rest us. truly learned something. FL same. HUGE parties either side home. family staying parents home built we've found sister Disney week planning coming Thanksgiving. husband seem concerned. sis asked parents feel comfortable that, think 3 days enough determine covid not. infuriating.  looking options leave. worth risk. care careful disney being, based pictures/videos CROWDED several places (included multiple parades attended). also attended huge halloween party guess surprised. astounded people's selfishness right now. won’t first unless risk so? Pulmonary embolism, aka blood clot lungs. blood clot heart = heart attack, brain = stroke, lungs = PE. 

Those scary, there's often multiple clots, way knowing patient's heart throw clots. large enough PE happen quickly patient goes fine, short breath, dead within 5 minutes. Got reason why? probably means 70-140 millions old folks trouble ... moot point single payer country man. basically registering disagreement break room policies sweatshop uses child labor. already expressed America's private medical care structure ""shitty"" want tell us run well? Gtfo. Honestly world needs quarantine America get shit together. also caught dining French Laundry last week. People clearly super pissed allowed attend dinner parties leaving thousands thousands people without work new outdoor dining restrictions go place week.

&amp;#x200B;

Most sites linking Fox 11 original article, link: Michigan? read article said lot bit normalcy May god getting impatient. Six months crap? Ugh. miss living. This. could quarantine 14 days go home. family money course. graduation honestly parents student student degree/diploma forever. Nothing missed except congratulations done via many avenues need person? 50% marriage ends divorce. what's worse, missing babies first birthday missing next 40 years? Whether kid dies way missed oppurtunities. 

It sounds like selfish short sighted thinking me. certain group sociopaths reject medicaid expansion got bunch rural hospital closed result. see Covid search trends daily google? searched ... Americans free make final choice going travel country despite government organization suggesting Christmas: “Hold ~~beer~~ eggnog.” Dogs work. someone grow food cities.

That's small part rural, food production main driver rural economy decades. Services manufacturing main driver. However, case rural. good portion best called ""legacy rural"" came support extractive industries supporting logistics chains longer place, never become viable again. Ok...I get alex Joe rogan terrible person. seriously lump two together like that...when Joe gone called dead children child actors? Like really, get people like wtf, means bad guy definition think of. yes, I'm aware numbers way down, still, gonna spread it, even Canada's much toned Thanksgiving last month resulted big enough increases cases, trail phases accelerated allow shortest possible time phases. normal data coming intervals started phases around time. record, many vaccine candidates necessarily phase 3 yet eventually start publishing results coming months.

The timing news known now. respect certain timelines, knew timelines now. I'm saying even analyst 0 years experience fair market value $40,000, much less someone years sports stats experience confused myself. meant 2 already effective vaccines, point one 70%, keep options open? going die due idiots. referring 40 ng/mL level data suggesting line significant protection Covid. better 40 below. YEEESSSSS

Also, hope you’re enjoying podcast much am! haven’t listened it, absolutely should. Pulmonary embolisms believe. find phases rolled out? take care 99 year old grandma 30... also trending key stats though. still accelerating. going pay stay home posting this, dad? Really glad options mRNA vaccines. pretty hesitant get RNA based technology new long term effects cannot predicted. Unpopular opinion: would rather Covid human rights wonder hospitals rural areas? 80's POTUS decided privatize medicine led shuttering 600 hospitals, almost exclusively rural areas? Probably man proposed NAFTA whose VP drafted it. 

By way, 500,000 less hospital beds 326,000,000 people 212,000,000 people. 

It's late admit wrong. need move forward point need 40% country snap help us. Fauci says it’s safe lol actually found Covid cases August prior Italy guess doesn’t help narrative. think team preparing worst case scenarios. would surprised Biden chooses strip inauguration down, maybe even small audience swearing ceremony, parade balls Oh wow new information 90%, 95%.... Oxford: ""wait us!"" 

Womp womp It’s 50% better seeing weeks ago....

Which makes question methodology poll. US CDC China's playbook hand use well . CDC probably world's advance pandemic containment policies expertise hand, politicians oligarchs prevented it. 

But mean must also see US capitalist democracy people right idiots make money. Mostly meaning make money idiots. China socialist plutocracy actually value lives citizen, rather see dollar signs big pharma sell vaccines to.

All goes show COVID US akin culling weak profits rich. actually stock market going even thousands die daily. Even they’re “well,” unless they’re part top 1% they’re still getting fucked still putting money ahead people. Seasons fear reaper. wind, sun rain, USA Even though it’s busiest it’s still pace 70-75 million less travelers week.

Be little positive 70 million Americans decided stay home .

A good chunk going kids coming home college also Hopefully actually allergies!! Lol COVID testing. one kids gets fever, stay home work get negative test result back. I’m gone, use PTO cover days missed. PTO empty, take “unpaid absences” remaining days eat cost. already happened twice year. hey, least jets flew one buildings couple months back.  '78 swine flu, vaccine rushed left 800 people paralyzed side effect. first wave people immunized

I sure others similar concerns Apparently holiday travel levels U.S. higher anticipated.

The social end pandemic here. Hopefully medical end months away. Either way, December January going woeful death totals. would like nurses doctors future?

even quit, LOT PTSD.

&amp;#x200B;

consider harm staff due burnout (or infection).

....already running short hospitals..

it makes problem worse.

&amp;#x200B;

you want hospital nurse patient ratio 

is 1: 8 8:1?

&amp;#x200B;

where think people die? Epithelial refers thin layer tissue lining organs vessels. thinking epidermis, specifically refers outer layer skin. /r/YourJokeButWorse stroke? cities subsidize suburbs ex-urbs, youre welcome tried didn’t work... :( Oxford vaccine also stored refrigeration temp 4-8C. easier store transport especially poorer countries I've gotten tired saying exact sentence year. Ugh. Personally, I've found eggs one best things eat terms make feel overall. consume three six day cholesterol always low normal test it. that's eating fair amount red meat well. 

I know things vary person person looking good source vitamin automatically count eggs unless actually already struggling cholesterol levels. 3 3 vaccines good far! get shot up?! Im ready! mean future adenovirus vaccines medicines become ineffective receiving vaccine gaining immunogenicity it? know adenovirus great delivery tool. airplanes dangerous grocery stores? girlfriend, wishes anger, went red eye home GMA sickly close death. gathering parents, arent inviting extended family all, still can't help annoyed though. anybody? Leadership area like fuck arent enforcing. always better less.

Too much Vitamin give kidney stones. takes weeks even months Vitamin levels drop blood. Vitamin supplements monitored doctors blood checks wanted see aim needs. epithelial tissues linings organs, including skin.

I suppose difference epithelial tissue lining blood vessels also express ACE2 receptors (which virus uses enter cells), whereas skin not. ACE2 important things like managing blood pressure.

Oh, quick Google shows [where ACE2 Skin seems express ACE2, there's plenty expression organs. chart circulatory system itself, blood vessels epithelial tissue expresses ACE2, easy next stop virus invades lung tissue.

I specific ""insightful thing"": virus attacks ACE2 plentiful. epithelial lining blood vessels such. Compare 78% compliance getting MMR vaccine. (2019 showed lowest percentage vaccinated children since early 70s) feel bad people who'd work makeshift ICU. They're probably used work, likelihood patients die, inadequacy makeshift setup. Welcome example 6 billion non-scientists misunderstanding correlation causation. True, don’t think it’s severe, also
People aren’t panic buying meat food. bad least lived. meat Walmart all. Think increase cases Christmas New Years hit right Biden inaugurated president. love America. fuck country dumb get rich? Oh wait, stolen land slavery probably hurt. would almost consider grave infrastructure failure us. hospitals lack ICUs really creating strain ones do, funding hospitals get intensive care units handle local patients? every hospital, even rural, couple beds would spread burden around. lost sympathy people support authoritarian treason pro-death. Sometimes karma comes delivers better justice government provide. Choices consequences. Probably allowed say subreddit “both sides” deserve equal respect.   Wow, really? always seemed like location better DTLA one. would shed real tears DTLA one closed... Getting zero breaks pandemic. people traveling better ask nurses doctors going miss holiday one taking pandemic seriously. Quite opposite experience. I’m nurse SNF/rehab, upwards 78 positive cases. I’ve 16 hour shifts, clocking least 80hrs week, little time myself. Wearing full PPE, low staff, low supplies, low patience. Big PEs young people 

What's PEs? isn’t really true. 

Many people subreddit claimed taking steps stop flu deaths Covid deaths, since precautions success exactly same. 

They say aren’t hundreds thousands die year flu worth die Covid. 

This common sentiment certain demographic. 

Does mean laws rules enforce belief? places, absolutely not, see progressive cities may influenced put things place constituents. implying you, layman, part scientific method. know common sentiment, US mathematically illiterate, think even greater focus stats human mind isn’t built understand probability risk. watch appreciate rocket launch; it’s hard risking car crashes plane hijackings. think take away ""as used"" failure. Worn til filthy; worn properly; people failed wear them. So, public screwed ""thing"" aka mask wearing would helped lot done properly. *control* populates newsfeed. rolls ... MUST FLOW (down toilet)!!1 survived 

wow like stats say: 99.4% survival rate. scream, scream, scream constantly. Every day new nightmare hellscape called Earth. I'm getting kind tired seeing this. Reddit/4Chan/etc., derivatives traditional message boards, dramatically different MySpace/Facebook/Instagram created term ""social media"" specifically distinguish two, despite social experiences. honest, assisted death sensitive topic half Europe. like one half modern law one really want hear it. Nazi history would Christian on... 

I surprised Germany already law doctor might went law encompass lot room letting patient die bead without painkiller care actively euthanising patient. presumably eat point went grocery store, even contracted deliveryperson. states open beds. go combat triage full combat people except sick loved one turned away. Remember beginning, pre-Thanksgiving pre-Christmas. Pretty soon hospitals doctors need police protection 24/7.
 
 
I would labelled conspiracy nut said summer, seems inevitable. wrong? relative inconvence overwhelming. AZ phase 2 report, side effects generally “a sore arm” “feeling bit fluey”. expected needle driven deltoid muscle immune system reacting antigen. Paracetamol helps go away day two. 

There handful “adverse events”, none judged likely anything vaccine. Someone got diverticulitis (caused bad diet decades); someone severe reaction wasp sting (an allergy); couple others. 

In phase 3 trial it’s known someone got transverse myelitis, rare condition involving localised inflammation spinal cord. patient also massive sports injury TM kicked in. trying sympathise big corporation know many fake claims going would know require people go extra miles make claim Apparently care quite bit. You’re spending time writing am. heart problem refusal people learn representatives voting for.

Projected ad spending US $250 *billion*. You, someone evidently thinks markets work, first recognize spend kind money without expecting return.

Inflation-adjusted, $283 billion 13 years total cost Apollo Gemini programs. That's $22 billion year.

You think can't fuck public opinions resources ten space races? think can't convince people down, left right, healthcare bad, global warming exist, whatever want?

People, even smart people, totally immune propaganda. They're certainly immune concerted efforts thousand well-paid, well-educated experts specifically designed deceive them. Saudi Arabia destabilizes big chunk world convinces people fly planes buildings murder innocents tiny fraction budget - $250 billion close *entire* spending Saudi Arabian government. spend [all health research development, public - think buy us anything? costs maintain entire Interstate Highway System, greatest network roads ever built man span continent sea shining sea - think buy us anything?

I mean say people responsibility educate themselves, way say underdog war responsibility defend best can. public vastly outgunned here, pretend government necessarily one actually want almost laughably naive. Even well-intentioned, intelligent, devoted citizen spending literally time debunking lies can't even come close outpacing rate they're plenty great countries choose alternative like China CCP north korea Venezuela

Right, yes, forgot ""social safety net"" necessarily means ""instant totalitarian communist-in-name-only dictatorship"". Oh, let try: hey youy23, want free 'tyranny' government badly, there's lots failed states that'd happy you. hear Somalia nice time year. Or, alternately, maybe people want push governments new directions without wanting move halfway across world?

There lots not-totalitarian states protect workers better US does. fact, almost every wealthy western nation so. Social media almost certainly amplifying effect behaviors. general public ready Internet.

NHL playoffs. 24 teams. team allowed max 52 people, 30 players. RemaIning would coaches support staff. Length time bubble: 3 weeks (half teams) 2months. 

So, double number people per team additional 12 teams.

Now logistics: NHL NBA bubbles, teams never left complex in. Hotels located games played. isn’t going happen football. would need 16 available fields per bubble city teams practice. dead right there. also means players would leaving “bubble” daily. Cause keep mind, it’s teams lockdown. Hotel facility personnel also restrictions. game day, could basically max 2 games per day would need 3.5 hours game, plus hour team, plus time cleaning.

This cheap vaccine, easy produce, stored 2-8 deg cel environments transported easily. means developing nations need compete wealthy nations update limited infrastructure. Further, severe covid cases hospitalizations anyone got vaccine. 

They also claim agreements place produce 3 BILLION doses vaccine Pfizer Moderna combined.

I know headline number sounds inadequate considering already seen, vaccine human kind might actually get herd immunity without deaths! That’s America fuck! ....that would require common sense... ya know No, read message responding to, say anything that. really cannot assume people track earlier discussions know people said before, without even mentioning it. So. 30 countries go increase lockdown then? 90% effective given half dose followed full dose second shot. study ran two arms. two full dose arm less effective, around 60% averaging 70% taking account groups. Nobody however severe dose hospitalised country needs unite strike point, bring government corporations knees. Consequences damned. Thanks posting that, would say important.

You might assume 95 every 100 people vaccinated protected Covid-19. that’s math works.
Experts say it’s easy misconstrue early results language vaccine researchers use talk trials hard outsiders understand.

Experts say it’s easy misconstrue early results language vaccine researchers use talk trials hard outsiders understand.

The front-runners vaccine race seem working far better anyone expected: Pfizer BioNTech announced week vaccine efficacy rate 95 percent. Moderna put figure vaccine 94.5 percent. Russia, makers Sputnik vaccine claimed efficacy rate 90 percent.

“These game changers,” said Dr. Gregory Poland, vaccine researcher Mayo Clinic. “We expecting 50 70 percent.” Indeed, Food Drug Administration said would consider granting emergency approval vaccines showed 50 percent efficacy.

From headlines, might well assume vaccines — people may receive matter weeks — protect 95 100 people get them. that’s actually trials shown. Exactly vaccines perform real world depend lot factors don’t answers yet — whether vaccinated people get asymptomatic infections many people get vaccinated.

Here’s need know actual effectiveness vaccines.
What companies mean say vaccines 95 percent effective?

The fundamental logic behind today’s vaccine trials worked statisticians century ago. Researchers vaccinate people give placebo others. wait participants get sick look many illnesses came group.

In case Pfizer, example, company recruited 43,661 volunteers waited 170 people come symptoms Covid-19 get positive test. 170, 162 received placebo shot, eight received real vaccine.

From numbers, Pfizer’s researchers calculated fraction volunteers group got sick. fractions small, fraction unvaccinated volunteers got sick much bigger fraction vaccinated ones. scientists determined relative difference two fractions. Scientists express difference value call efficacy. there’s difference vaccine placebo groups, efficacy zero. none sick people vaccinated, efficacy 100 percent.

A 95 percent efficacy certainly compelling evidence vaccine works well. number doesn’t tell chances becoming sick get vaccinated. own, also doesn’t say well vaccine bring Covid-19 across United States.


What’s difference efficacy effectiveness?

Efficacy effectiveness related other, they’re thing. vaccine experts say it’s crucial mix up. Efficacy measurement made clinical trial. “Effectiveness well vaccine works real world,” said Naor Bar-Zeev, epidemiologist Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School Public Health.

It’s possible effectiveness coronavirus vaccines match impressive efficacy clinical trials. previous vaccines guide, effectiveness may prove somewhat lower.

The mismatch comes people join clinical trials perfect reflection population large. real world, people may host chronic health problems could interfere vaccine’s protection, example.

The Centers Disease Control Prevention long history following effectiveness vaccines they’re approved. Thursday, agency posted information website plans study effectiveness coronavirus vaccines. find opportunities compare health vaccinated people others communities received vaccine.
What exactly vaccines effective doing?

The clinical trials run Pfizer companies specifically designed see whether vaccines protect people getting sick Covid-19. volunteers developed symptoms like fever cough, tested coronavirus.

But there’s abundant evidence people get infected coronavirus without ever showing symptoms. it’s possible number people got vaccinated clinical trials got infected, too, without ever realizing it. cases indeed exist, none reflected 95 percent efficacy rate.

People asymptomatic still spread virus others. studies suggest produce fewer viruses, making less threat infected people go develop symptoms. people get vaccinated stop wearing masks taking safety measures, chances spreading coronavirus others could increase.

“You could get paradoxical situation things getting worse,” said Dr. Bar-Zeev.


Will vaccines put dent epidemic?

Vaccines don’t protect people get them. slow spread virus, can, time, also drive new infection rates protect society whole.

Scientists call broad form effectiveness vaccine’s impact. smallpox vaccine greatest impact all, driving virus oblivion 1970s. even vaccine extremely high efficacy clinical trials small impact people end getting it.

“Vaccines don’t save lives,” said A. David Paltiel, professor Yale School Public Health. “Vaccination programs save lives.”

On Thursday, Dr. Paltiel colleagues published study journal Health Affairs simulated coming rollout coronavirus vaccines. modeled vaccines efficacy rates ranging high low, also considered quickly widely vaccine could distributed pandemic continues rage.

The results, Dr. Paltiel said, heartbreaking. colleagues found comes cutting infections, hospitalizations deaths, deployment mattered much efficacy. study left Dr. Paltiel worried United States done enough prepare massive distribution vaccine months come.

“Time really running out,” warned. “Infrastructure going contribute least much, more, vaccine success program.” That’s still good result. need many vaccines possible, pandemic ends faster! 29th day right? US populace failed mean. Nobody made mandatory follow madmen. failed state caused leadership, also people supporting leadership. Normal flu different. efficacy flu vaccine related whether correct strain flu virus vaccine covers. vaccines developed seqirus, etc effective, strains may wrong manufacture basically starts winter before, shot dark. Honestly interesting question us right now. thought Dec 2012 going end world... Dec 2020 come become crappy hospices medical care surplus.

In June, cases high. protests, riots, even, may spread illness. 

Outdoor events proven really spread virus easily indoor activities dining restaurants, going crowded bars on. 

Not large crowds outdoors threat, they're less significant poorly ventilated bar, casino, restaurant even public school. 

Now, even outside events (such protests did, unfortunately bad actors rioting arena, whether anger justified not) far masks say maybe protests, rallies on. 

Point being, June many cases makes sense point, since November, threat become much significant. 

Protesting rallying ... Virus give shit . 

Indoors, outdoors, without masks? Yeah that's different thing. Especially cases climbing.

95% effective, long? 
I'm sure people think things normal. what, gotta wear mask. lot morons can't even manage right. nose such.. can't breath, joke.  work night mask on. first sucked biggie. I've began think, yeah I'm liking wear mask now.  catch cold people trying prevent covid.

So happens vaccine last months? mean I'm sure virus around long while.  I'd imagine focusing treatments would far important vaccine uncertainty results duration effectiveness. Usually takes month cases hit hospitalization stage. We're hitting like 200K per day. 

With Thanksgiving travel, Christmas blood bath. 

Might even see 3000 deaths day January. punishment god sin weve caused earth. God warning us definitely deserve lot praise solid system place take care everything. basically, they're poor. Every patient needs admitted hospital, turned away sent home due overcrowding **will die**. Kinda ironic right? people socialized healthcare dont want support ""irresponsible"" people purposely make choices arent productive health...well ones that. Going doctors orders. Always Republicans spend way much time reddit. Take break it’s affecting thinking creep even more. People tent long time, another set, another set. really better open air? really know would think open air would better, wind would push stuff away? IDK. agree everyone everything protect others. Wear masks, don’t gather, stay 6’ apart, wash hands, etc. it’s “laughably simple.” People’s lives completely upended. People missing lifetime events like weddings, graduations, babies’ first birthdays. Don’t act smug feel like you’re missing life us really are. really take immunity long build up? 2nd shot make last longer? Yes no. people, totally end home get togethers. dissuade few, that’s better nothing. lot people live one bedroom apartments people zero intentions hosting bunch people. also think people chosen eat outdoor places okay feel like it’s safe (they see tables spaced out, watch staff wiping things down, etc), wary hosting something homes since every article news piece focuses heavily bad in-home gatherings. dies covid, sure explanation could want Makes sense could guess. choice part concerns me. feel upset people work , providing drinks service selfish assholes. enjoying drinks stressing survive financial health aspect getting covid. beginning get really pissed office irresponsible humans.  F***** Texas. always Texas. Can’t say anyone harming anyone else, it’s virus is, people don’t purposeful intent getting others sick. Like said, necessarily. 🙄 Different people somewhat differing immune system responses, antibodies produced one strain clearly always provide full protection other, *as cases China Nevada show*.

At point say *absolutely doesn't*, make claim degree does.

And anything, ""robust natural immune response"" SARS-CoV-2's multiple strains causes much damage severe cases COVID-19, last read.

Irs beyond shameful chickens get Covid I’ll pissed. run set even birds can’t get communicable diseases. Either learn first time, Tories' intentions words align.   Man. even fortnights here. I’m 5th day walking stairs tires takes breath. diagnosed hiking 3 miles day uphill work. Really comes one defines dark. light end tunnel since two vaccines shown great results; however, there’s months reach point matters. Cases don’t seem relenting hospitals pretty stretched. Couple factors together holiday travel paints pretty grim picture. least, know doctors nurses going dark winter. nurse doctor? essential employees? Maybe want stay home can’t buy groceries. 

Just FYI 1.39 million people Earth died virus. hardly qualifies “nothing.” 

If wear mask socially distance things go back normal faster. Downplaying pandemic prolongs it.

I’m sure someone know died would different attitude. can’t imagine sad existence zero empathy is. It’s unforgivable. #If kind warning beforehand virus... 👀 aware odds dying ridiculously low right?  I'm saying guy get benefits, since prison guard ""first responder""?? show solidarity pandemic yes to. mention people know encouraging others wear masks. virus also thought realized harm would cause going suck up. big ask everything country affords wear mask bit figure treatments vaccines. actual f... guys always excuse  tonight?

Y'all deserve better. Come Colorado, we'll happily take heroic efforts. 😊 Exactly. Happy Cake Day.

Actually maybe I'm fair. used think tents safe isolated diners. found virus could linger air hours, people dined could infect you. wife's dad retired became flight instructor recently guy take bunch classes waiting covid test family members tested positive. ended positive, everyone contact work cancel lessons booked.  texas fucked beyond belief could go Yes, stay locked home like good little goyim, degrading physical mental state.

Not exactly.  Normal triage happens hospitals time, essentially adjusting order treatment patients ensure everyone best possible outcome cases time critical seen quickly. 

What describing ""combat triage"" ""rationing care"" care given individuals likely survive, IE people sick COVID need ICU another condition (age, lung disease, anything serious) makes unlikely survive may need sent home die.

Hoping aunt uncle haven’t seen almost year vaccinated quickly stop aunts Birthday February, even won’t vaccinated yet. They’re desperate see everyone breaks heart. love hosting people seeing family.

They’re excited get vaccinated (due health issues they’re locks first wave)  Hospitals full close now. Death rate going to, 3-4%. Doubling period new cases running 18 days, bet see drop 12 days Christmas. Let's assume 2 weeks now. 

Current deathrate 2K/day corresponds 100K new case rate 2 weeks ago.

With levels care 4K/day Dec10. I'm betting 4.5.

Now \*are\* beds. Dec 24 new cases 800K/day new deaths 10-12K. nonsense, plenty Americans play fortnite Sign beta testing!  Yeah won’t hundreds thousands poor work people.

Give 3-4 weeks, sadly. Stay dorm. Lives money disagree though. realIze many people listened used way intentionally aggravate opposite political party members taking seriously. Also imagine conservative media echoing Trump’s seriousness it: imagine Fox News demonized covid much Mexican caravan Hillary’s emails etc? would absolutely huge effect surge rn due Trump rallies gatherings. I’m sorry hear that. used ‘grandpa’ did. none people love risk group? behavior determined solely people circle opposed empathy fellow humans?  Yeah...after months BLM protests, ""outrages"" people going church hypocritical. Yes, clearly people calling Pfizer vaccine lot knowledge details partnership companies, it’s one they’ve heard of. Charibtable activities arent mutually exclusive religious gatherings.

In Victoria, Aust gatherings Religious charatible activities still took place (and non-Religious ones well). I'm disappointed too. 3 stepkids age able experiences point lives. I'm glad took concerts exposed little travel could. Hopefully you, they, able make lost years. would suspect necessarily representative majority behaviour, agree government bigger economic shock they're expecting (are even making plans? - Brexit car crash suggests planning strong point).

I thinking back thresholds action, values goals might underlie them. places pretty obvious, example NZ decided illness death much justify continues take requisite action prevent it. 

It seems Tories' threshold informed primarily threat power. informed weakly issues relating wellbeing population. explain mixed messaging, u-turns delayed action. changing course action (including anything all) dissenting voices beyond threshold level volume.

In case competition voices public health short-term survival SMEs come direct conflict they've tried stave threat power (and insodoing revealed fact care little concerns relating either).

I suppose would change previous statement then; whilst maintain Tories would value population spending money population vulnerable people kept alive - really value either deeply. real concern maintaining control purposes promotion these. wish wife could pulled school too, alas teachers expendable.

Obviously good reason. think everyone special situation?  covid-19 alter gut biology? significance difference post immunity? They’re literally full already! see refrigerated trucks used morgues? wholeheartedly disagree hypothesis pray day understand said damaging. really, Canada way smoother trying get anything VA. Shorter wait times things US hospitals too. mean shutting restaurant industry without stimulus basically kill restaurants. They’re bad shape already, shut basically cripple restaurant industry quite while. that’s even getting restaurant bar employees, generally aren’t well first place, would world financial pain.

It shouldn’t main decider, CRUCIAL next stimulus start bail restaurant industry.

Another stimulus crucial point Seeing lot people Texas still don’t think Covid real, I’m surprised anymore. guess you’re right. prefer term welfare check it’s focused people’s welfare stock market. Maybe hold dose manufactured biontech. take one made pfizer

No weights today. Lol. That's good question, hopefully would neutralize specific adenovirus vector. possible vectors developed future could work, technology necessarily one-time thing. also know would change time. Maybe strong reaction vector would decline while, making new vaccines using similar vectors effective again. I'd take everything grain salt, though. efficacy results seems optimal dosage based cases. usual, need research. Yes able find TP three stores I've gone weekend. specific brands chicken - availability spotty since March tendies. Looks like people avoiding Tyson, 'cause that's left shelves am. 


It bad yet, right, continues it'll even worse think... Question: anybody know (if anything) countries doing, planning do, area? curious. Thanks!  Shoutout city folks keep coming rural towns “safe” recreation..bringing virus place resources...

Those us trying best get sick place 0 ICU beds exist really appreciate it.

Moral story hillbillies anti mask city slickers follow rules. poor? Less 1/8 Americans live poverty We’re going fight back. too... bur let's real, problem start last 4 years.  exactly saying. sure either. entire working class ignorance right that's problem. get sick hope take bed someone actually cares community. Results also largely meaningless. Negative test mean negative, given delay time show up. Also, completely isolate 100% test, worthless introduced chance infected.

Not much proactive it. People justify they're safe, they're still going social activities. mind boggling people still believed spouted lie. Even vaccine developed american tax payers money, NONE woul've Trump.

Oh wait, that's fake news. _did_ pay $750 taxes all! Also, considering population density, COVID never problem large island nation Australia. There's lot hype surrounding ivermectin still adopted yet interesting see whether start trials soon  Oxford vaccine case anyone wondering. 10 times cheaper 2 predecessors.

Also stored 2 8 degree Celsius compared minus 70 degrees Pfizer.

This makes much viable developing developed countries.  think data still vaccine actually prevents asymptomatic spread though. definitely help, could another wrinkle herd immunity. Sorry anyone LA county owns restaurant works one. Guess fucked. Similar boat, change one case possibly nine. previously wanted people get tested don’t want people get tested? moron. think people would try defend poor vulnerable often given impossible choices get life. opposite problem, without taking train therapist's office like normally really difficult remember appointment. I'm calls keep closing accident brain temporarily convinces watching video talking person ignorant. Scientists giving us facts protecting ourselves, families community. one “moving goal posts” plenty vaccines ready go. see hit shelves? I’d gladly take three main ones right given chance shows weak are. right thing often easy. Life asking us step plate, look many us choking. Ah yes, rural mega churches, famous taking virus seriously. Oh wait they’re famous literally opposite that.

So everyone small town like you? Theh take virus seriously don’t take religion seriously? never get pissed people you’re sureounded by? Sure. There's difference testing understand spread virus trying use tests excuse throw mitigation measures.  Nah, thanks. Maybe 10 years  get shot 95% chance making immune covid making even arent immune, still incredibly reduced chance severe covid symptoms, end quickly vaccine widely available.


If widely available April, would say probably restrictions Summer. Melbourne likely densely populated city. agree. bargain away, happened long hired in. shocked found out. 

There's rumblings sick out. I'm totally it, long takes. regards hospitalizations, give data released CDC regular basis. take nit-picking inclined.

nothing data hospitalization rate infected.

[here totalization 540k total That's 5%, states reported full data second statement, we'll disagree. People make decisions themselves. Unless position elected appointed leadership that's do.

Sweet, guess drive around drunk, that's decision sure mother father ever told world, get define people ""need"". faster learn that, sooner over.

The said right back you. damn, that's gonna expensive.. I’m Florida think beaches closed 2 weeks (SW Florida) Oh no, horrible authoritarian nightmare getting fucking test avoid spreading killer disease. Muh constitutional rights important.  group people you’re referring to.

They morons, yes. Morons exclusive one group. anyone surprised? Tyson literally give FUCK employees--at least anyone outside office, is. pencil numbers, plaster across full page spread rural newspaper

Reading comprehension critical thinking, math skills also hard come by. Decades gutting education populace. believe talking [1976 flu vaccine left [400 paralyzed 40 million took it.

That 0.001% vaccinated. COVID death rate way higher that, even healthy people.

That also 40 years ago. We’ve gotten much better vaccine technology since then. able work, don't. I'm same. Slight clarification - P100 still dust mask (like N95). Lots come additional organic vapor, oil, acid cartridges, many don't. Yeah Jesus put test locals faith think ever convince lot people still believe it. matter friends family get it, they'll continue believe delusions certain political party vehemently spewing.

You'll find excuse poor leadership here, explanation. cannot fathom boss with, say, 25 direct reports might become little overwhelmed year maybe snap employee manner described here, really leadership material either. way excuses behavior, reminder too, human.
 
One best traits, IMHO, good leader empathy sorely lacking it. I'm trolling, I'm telling truth sincere. hometown California curfew right cases spiking much, mask compliance extremely high. working. surrounded ones dont. makes say that? Texans wearing masks go out. Shout India. regret they've told us months! begged pleaded mother go see sister thanksgiving (we cancelled full family gathering) simply listen. ""I'm everything right - sticking bubble, getting tested."" 
 
Right. million people launch global superspreader event kill enormous amount people, can't go one year without eating mediocre Turkey eaten 68 years room sister. 
 
They get it. Nobody thinks wrong. Everyone rationalizing plans one way another. Even safe compared others, need solidarity collective sacrifice, bunch people implementing different compromise plans convinced safe justified, really going end snowballing predictable catastrophe. Considering I'm going turning 20, college, havent even campus yet, you, want party, drink, fun over. zero ICU beds even without covid? Christ, I'm sorry. Hang there. Something recently learned.. vaccinated doesn’t mean can’t get virus spread others. means won’t get disease. live NJ pray dont another lockdown. Everyone wear masks please! end day still rare.

^^^^\s So, feel fortunate, still wearing masks social distancing. day day hasn’t changed, less anxiety. seeing family traveling. all, could wrong J&amp;J vaccine efficiency hasn’t proven yet. now, plan 2 years, J&amp;J unblind offer vaccine. probably they’ll follow others manufacturers offer real vaccine participants available commercially. idea downvoted, agree little friend think bad idea refuse medicine people mindset. sound like great precedent would sort make sense vaccinate distribution chain.. Sure, understand real reason. change fact crazy positions continue called them. I’ve edited response mention refusal abiding CDC guidelines. article stated contributing problem well. issue complex humble opinion, seems largely self inflicted many them. It’s 90% administered correctly.

The moderna/Pfizer trials also tested participants symptoms, whereas trial tested participants weekly.

Seeing least 40% covid cases asymptomatic, 95% results basically bullshit never said rural people hillbilly trumpets said urban people generally take virus seriously rural people. Let's literally go faster light! LOL, meta study. Meta studies grad school garbage. read studies try form conclusions never tested vitamin D, parent compound tissue vitamin activation, likely important direct physiological role beyond originally anticipated local tissue autocrine system.

With single explanation ""important physiological role"" is. best saying evidence small amounts ingested vitamin converted usable forms body outside liver. claiming single health benefit never tested any, read papers pulled data make completely untested hypothesis.

That second one argues proper clinical trials determine positive effects preventing cancer.  asking study determine effective ineffective.

Please stop advetising garbage marketing site selling overpriced test kits. We’re Thanksgiving year. sixteen us indoors too. single person get Covid. soon after, negative sent home. knows? bigger issue hospital room sick little girl. Thank you!!!  American living New Zealand, informed accurate statement.

Yours smug, touch one. Well agree cool They’ve saying it. don’t know people don’t believe them. Nope. I’ve got second time. I’m worse time. July. Tested negative 2 weeks. tested positive Thursday. Man, dad died, bare bones cremation/wake could (didn't get casket, used funeral home's display box ashes, etc.), still several thousand dollars. absolutely insane. sorry loss. Yea happening massive scale South Dakota. I'm Ontario, people know who've mentioned it, all. it, almost none actually know works. Who? author article it’s basically run mRNA vaccines do, potential hold. Yeah New Zealand plan going work American. need like 90+% compliance happen. don’t disagree I’ve personally heard one family member canceling gatherings week. 

There another side people deserve credit sacrifice. feel like we’re better without 40% Fortunately already plan drinking alone. every year. Yeah I've never understood posts every day either. Meatballs same, top got hacked essentially offline going month now. hacked Sallie Mae instead?? word expect findings report emergency use application J&amp;J vaccine? Must nice pay rent huh? may first pandemic actually win against. Hopefully, nature gracious loser time. personal responsibility, right? that's mantra I'll write comment part this. Pfizer participants given antibody tests end trial knew whether contracted disease not. 

Like said, I’m taking Moderna Pfizer vaccine it’s effective. people want go vaccine, I’m happy them! much safety data enough? gonna wait 2, 3 years? gonna wait everyone else take first?

I guess staunchly mRNA vaccines would take Oxford perhaps? comment section disgusting Thank you! feel like problems. problems, pervasive. focus slipping, motivation exist. everything just... harder real sources. reach certain # infections control group could interim analysis.

So example Pfizer said they’d 3 interim analysis: one 25, 45, 100 infections (not exact values don’t paper front rn)

What happened infections spiked fast blew right past 45 100’s next analysis ended last one. 

So study went faster people got infected faster latest surge cases.

But don’t worry study isn’t - ongoing probably even General use authorization.  Sole Survivor... think that's personal decision. wouldn't, won't, use savings work I'm still able work.  Good point, sad. 

I wish well also! LA County provides free tests. mask mandate since early pandemic spring, week ago expanded outdoors. else officials do? truly INCREDIBLE news third world countries

Hell yeah! USA! USA! U- wait minute almost like place reason   clarified position edit. immunity fit, overweight hampering human bodies ability fight this, that's definite. fat shaming, also saying okay overweight. Everybody wants follow science lately, let's. Fat normalized. accept overweight, lie fat fit. drink home. done. think commenter trying preserve original stated purpose downplaying masks - allow healthcare facilities stock prevent hoarding regular citizens. Minnesota resident here. definitely paying (and Wisconsin's) lazefair attitude now. :( yay. lets keep ER empty possible people Nz completely irrelevant entire world. They’re already fucked. seen president? know currently supporters front state capitals? would classify outlier? said pandemic would change everything. 4 day work week, Mondays everyone loves them. DARE DREAM 7 day old account, I'm thinking troll. wanna w confirm - traveled today (for work) - crowded I've seen since shutdown. travel twice week, back road since May. 

Gonna lot dead grandma's grandpa's soon... :( Indeed. Hopefully information well, able discern major vectors (such mass transit larger gatherings).  would take something that's less effective immune system? Crime surge cause cases, already has.

I feel bad news many New Yorkers moving away bad city got....Shame. probably still get vaccine, help boost immune system. seen couple people aggressively argue claustrophobia reason never wearing masks. Also asthma, really drives wall.  Ok grocery stores shut get sued anyone going eat. reason government told lock safety did, wore masks necessary essentially wiping covid region  good idea. people get vaccine side effects shown minimal, events services gonna want proof vaccination, it'll probably go really much issue. Hello there! Yes, surprised also demand. time store public since March. strict isolation. Went birdwatching times location one goes. Gas fill twice full wipedown touched anything. hardly wait vaccines. Even then, need take precautions awhile, least start cut spread, hospital personel safer it, thus safer get medical care problems (like cancer treatment heart disease) without catching Covid doctors nurses. Per CDC need quarantine get retested within 3 months (in reality probably even longer). wish people content agreeing disagree Tests ongoing infection free Sweden. There's drive-through testing tests picked various pharmacies relative. 

Tests antibodies however free. price varies depending kind test. Meanwhile obvious turnaround, employees care company interested bottom lines, grounds termination. case, get arrested wearing mask. Im worried. point dont care anymore.... Shit mods always locking threads sub. like mods like like economic policy, minimal interference. Life risk. Freedom important safety. Suddenly, world needs ""proof vaccination"" token ID card, coin, something, APP possibly.

Who ever invents patents 2 dollar object, simultaneously gaining world acceptance validity, becomes multibillionaire short period time. I’m going home two kids SO. I’m fine that. got 11 day stretch rural Texas, I’m happy time home. Ieave series 24 on/24 shifts starting Saturday. vaccine successfully stimulates immune system create antibodies Covid-19. disputing this? However, different societies managed different strayegies different outcomes. Either countries managed without causing health economic catastrophe humans, maybe human nature , another causes. course, comfortable think human nature, specially considering tmost worst hit countries share common. Ugh. think Australians gaze wistfully across oceans envy chaos carnage abroad.

What shame can't send there. sub worst lol. quarantined three weeks three tests, one rapid two regular, come back negative span. parents quarantined pretty much last two months also negative tests. I'm going parents rarely see nowadays, care this, ""Not letting somebody feel left out"" BS. started calling Orange Plague? Really awesome guy, fuck federal government giving boatloads cash big corporations ended firing employees anyway, actual small business suffered continue suffer.  Meh. read account volunteer, said first shot bother him, second gave fatigue, body aches chills 12 hours. it. 

If that's worst does, I'll take day getting second shot watch TV day. Big whoop. far know, chose voluntaries live countries virus great circulation (Brazil, UK...) ""employee fit corporate culture""

""employee poor performance""

""employee wore red shirt""

""employee...."" get point here. choice work choice work. want deal people, find another career. 

Is... point was? non-point. choice. one children’s vaccine schedule age 11. ICAO talking creating cell phone based system paper Remember COVID originally claimed conspiracy ""what disease china."" existence got outed media claimed ""its human transferrable Chinese government said allow flights china back, claim wise another conspiracy theorist"". It’s not. I’m sorry gave impression wanting downplay deaths. 

But bending curve truly great news. Tell NSW daily infections 700 Students survive 1 year w/o teachers. Sure, society whole negatively affected gap year education they'll survive.

On hand, NOBODY. NOBODY. NOBODY society survive 1-year w/o medical workers. shit. Shits fucked work EMS student clinical ER. mess. 

They’re running nurses. sick people, even without COVID, coming sicker they’ve delaying seeking routine emergency care (one day couple weeks back intubated 3 diabetics ER). ICU patients ER waiting transfer upstairs, metric considered talk ICU beds. 

Most ambulance agencies upgraded PPE assume every call COVID. Deconning truck tacks least another 30 minutes onto call, meaning less ambulances service given time. means need medic, would normally 5-10 minute wait 30+ minute wait since they’re coming out. 

Not mention increased travel brought back trauma rates car accidents, falls, etc. hospitals kick students, reduces number helping hands. 

There LOT moving parts aren’t even considered beyond hospital capacity.

We’re seeing lot geriatric cases, 40+ crowd starting come well. Sadly, months unemployment erased rainy day fund. People losing jobs due pandemic doesn’t mean irresponsible. airports get shut down??? Like, ones supposed flying regardless right? still open? hope essential workers first phase vaccinations. deserve it. needs said still think sweden's approach early year solved problem.  mean incubates quietly mutating, everyone false sense security... like sort devil baby. let wear mask, wouldnt gotten sued 

So youre saying badlybrum stores risk health people shutdown? Yes. like ones violate health safety codes would shutdown potentially sued problem. Good luck everything there. se dessem uma coxinha depois da segunda dose todo mundo iria Weird woosh Oh, crazy person.
 
Cool, cool. 
 
Science exists, bro. Look it. little late ""I care people die new diseases, people die poverty, hunger diseases Cancer relevant worldview"".

Neither Swedish Danish mink industry. 

And Denmark away mink farming. Saying blunt lie. Damn, sure love western propaganda cling individual detriment. Seriously, that's take away this? Same, tried going months ago. one followed arrows, though least wearing masks. worth risk candles whatever. Maybe late 2021.  lot reasons, think advisable back normal cases start trending themselves. believe 9% figure. ton people use turn signals switching lanes. sure least 30% regularly not. mention almost everyone speeds degree (5 limit common). rest think sounds pretty correct. drive large enough bulldozer wrong way highway, risk death fucking tiny. Thanks FAA's (normally) high standard safety, deadly crashes cause commercial aviation happen rate 1 2 million, would make likely 5-standard-deviation event normal distribution.

Yeah small businesses gotten money first. Instead giving large corporations false promises keeping people employed given cash directly employees corporations could ride unemployed period could find new job. dont know going this. Nazi Germany government Germany handled 1918 outbreak. articles months old possible thinking changed universal rollout seen best solution (so hard keep all!), UK real democracy time, still imperial monarchy majority British subjects rights. Heh, going say they'd better use industrial antiviral foggers new administration. life get back normal July 2021. Yeah limit sales one per person again. EUA emergency approval. 

Analysts predicting Pfizer/Moderna get approved end December don’t see easy path AZ/Oxford. whole dose thing immense fuck apparently came error. never intended dose cohort lower dose. question understand even going how/why wade hot mess data well done clear trials Moderna Pfizer. 

Maybe eventually approved end day personally want get vaccine works 62-70% time one works time. don’t even know make mistaken dose cohort.  much worse drowning lung juice? allowed me, I'd shoot right now. Asking questions stupid, part socratic method. Even support millions people rioting around country entire summer so... work part time summer pay college, go find good job, march office speak boss (good handshakes important). good job, buy first house retire pension surely receive good job. easy youth days seem understand it.

I expect many development well. first months means year later? Good? know there’s one 1 month maybe 1 year. go home check. reddit experts said work lockdown schools open. answer must shut 5G network briefly. Funny Covid doesn’t give crap freedom. Sure youtube can. Last time fixed something youtube video watched twice, started fix, questions, watched 2 times. put together different ways even combinationally possible finally worked. fine collectable machine like I'm working on. 

Based experience: someone learning intubation youtube kill doxen people close enough right even survival chance. really know though, perhaps real doctor/nurse cares make better guess. Counter argument - lotta people getting tested something stupid dangerous.

The spread occur return home Im 20s Ill line soon they'll say shoot up. Im worried covid myself, honestly wasnt others, Id probably take chances wait. isnt case.

Since affects everyone, want people scared see healthy young person go fine. Maybe motivate one person edge. 1940 

Vaccines come long way last century. Back could quite dangerous. commend who've committed test subjects. ignore volunteers sacrifices would horrible slight always get downvoted sharing experience unions, many unions political leaders getting kickbacks company politicians go lobby make sure bargain away ""expensive"" benefits.

Worked union plant 7 years downvote one away well Yeah....guess healthcare allowed different viewpoint masses. *deep sigh*  anyone else skeptical companies coming vaccines within week?

Like, there’s population desperate vaccine shady president willing waive regulations. massively skeptical 3 firms come virus within month election, claiming 70%+ effectiveness (when normal vaccines nowhere near effective)

Have studies even survived peer review process yet? Sure, physical capability striking. ways get around strike clause straight ignoring first response. completely nude. Nothing. go unaffiliated urgent care. won’t. one, study end way sooner 2 years. also I’m running clinical study well wouldn’t want anyone study. time would say might commercial vaccine available wouldn’t want take someone else’s dose avoided. would rather call tell I’m dropping study reason. Well. There's 330 million people US. personally hearing less 5 family members using common sense exactly significant. Airborne / Fomite transmission across ocean? Research recently confirmed obvious (that restaurants, lesser extent schools workplaces). three, manage leaving schools open (and significant number workplaces, simply care), better. it’s regular thing since keep livestock stacked top covered shit piss waiting novel
virus develop it. Covid-19 came Chinese wet market, next ome could easily come American slaughter houses.

We need either clean global meat industry drastically reduce consumer demand meat. going lot viruses like this. dude! Vitamin D1 , 2, 3, 4? thing?

BTW jacking dont count, even leaves breathless. Put shut up. first time i've ever heard ""beginning end"" good thing. Perhaps concern company-run trials typically lot longer this, they’re skeptical long term data idiotic take. Crime causing Covid? sense even right?

I blame people. many anti-vax folks despise dangerous rhetoric flawed logic. understand folks coming from. fair “all red tape cut” REASON people concerned (and frankly, level concern isn’t unfounded slightest). red tape reason - patient safety. people worried become another thalidomide situation, saying “don’t worry, cut red tape” isn’t exactly calming. sounds like exercise.

Now developing modern vaccine year? Wow. like greatest scientific feat dare. easy see people skeptical disbelieving. 

But that's oh them. guess that's vaccine stock rest us Almost... yet people think social isolation effect mental health... live. wanton ignorance may kill them. Enjoy thanksgiving however choose. meal  Oh wow that’s actually real title +1 me! Can't lock down. fucking sneak middle night to.

There major gaps risk reduction, low-risk activities really shouldn’t banned higher tiers are.

Indoor church attendance big issue one example.

It simply shouldn’t case spaces outdoor dining banned churches sizable gatherings indoors (or outdoors without adequate space).

*Especially* churches deep live steaming while. It’s much ripe shifting online. never understood cruises. idea trapped boat thousands strangers sounds like literal torture. sub serves purpose except spread misinformation unabated mods allow propaganda anti-sciences rhetoric “spreads right message”.

People interested actual information moved science sub. ones left collapsers spreading misinformation try bring collapse society “do-gooders” spreading misinformation “get people take virus seriously”.

They’re two groups spreading propaganda misinformation 24/7.

No wait, I'm not. Yup. That's exactly article saying. get-togethers undoubtedly contribute community transmission virus. Canada’s recent Thanksgiving certainly added rising cases; increase may happen here, too, United States embarks holiday season like other. That’s Centers Disease Control Prevention Thursday warned strongly gathering others outside household Thanksgiving.  masks supposed work... guess that's happens snowflakes keep whining closing early, limited capacity.


No sales you. China already banned sale meat isn’t beef, pork, poultry fish. Although hear ban hardly enforced since exotic meats popular among Chinese elite It’s submitted review, meet 10th. stupid plan. already know everyone vaccinated least 2022. First healthcare workers people risk 2021. Financially already precarious situation. People go airline require this. continuing hate conservatives got us Yup.

TBH, since started making mixed drinks home, I'm pretty much ruined bars. idea called that. remember back day very, hungover Thanksgivings trying act, well, hungover around family hanging Satyricon wherever favorite bands playing. Seemed like always big shows going night.

We cannot responsible health, includes speculation dosages. need general information, please refer [CDC's need specific medical advice, please contact qualified medical professional area. ([More  discuss doctor. Developing stones real concern people taking lots supplements. Honestly it’s people telling us stay home don’t themselves, straight-up didn’t care (like Trump).

We conspiracy theorists think mask done form “control”, people rationalize throngs thousands celebrate election protest pandemic. college kids throwing COVID parties. religions holding secret weddings thousands attendance.

“If one else it, I?” mantra going across US, it’s across every single demographic. We’re fucked. n vaccines comparison?  Exactly. accepted definition Eastern Europe, image search find 100 different definitions. One thing almost common almost strangely exclude Greece, regardless fact one easternmost European nations. Greece always rejected belonging surroundings, spite obvious geographic cultural proximities. Oh noes... starts. virus nothing want shut small businesses it. they'll make vaccine mandatory airlines, certain public jobs, etc. expansion government power private matters. next step collectivism gonna end communism. might take 20 years that's going. slow process. Look swedan, lockdown anything fine. 5G thing? think likely higher that. large staff single one going take vaccine. single one.

One dad die disease still anti-mask anti-vaccine Driving inherently dangerous therefore government ban driving. Yeah, left bartender $100 cover $15 tab night (wife sat patio), didn’t tell wife. bartender came walking away said left much. said no, we’re good, explain wife left $85 tip hot bartender. Also note Australia, intra state boarders. ages couldn’t travel one city another even within state. 50km limit unless field worker Truckie basically. r/upliftingnews Theres much do, first complete lockdown left governor almost support Locking again.

You remember parts PA saw 90 day ban non essential anything, even non essential travel banned, could get Ticket driving didnt essential reason. thought messaging CDC masks reserved healthcare workers everyone else stay doors socially distance higher supply masks. That’s works. didn’t divide 8 20k added hocus pocus around masks social distancing... something accept.
Here Melbourne Australia we've strict 3 months lockdown, including 9 hour daily curfew, succeeded driving surging daily case numbers zero, we've 24th straight day without single new case.
Very people followed rules letter people flagrantly disregarded them, enough people followed enough time.
That's needs, people follow shorter time restrictions need place get 85% people complying mostly rules get end.
So stay positive I'm trying say, people want things need bit encouragement, majority carry 10 15% whatever reason join in. need sent home die.

This makes wonder person told. get enough information know might able driven another state there's open bed somewhere? I'd drive family member day meant getting hospital overcrowded.

Californian... sadly see shit happening too. problem unfettered capitalism party affiliations. I'm Green voter see greed valued market commodity rather political ideology. ...who cares? Like importance this?

Now tell actually BioNTech, Biopharmaceutical New Technologies SE, that's important lol people even enjoy Thanksgiving? see memes poss people pissed deal racist uncle. suspect you’re right. bad welfare actually quite good concept (politics aside).  No. US strict triage regulations drilled every doctor nurse UK head vaccine task force said something similar gov changed mind back first two vaccine results.  tents city hospitals. still ran beds within days.

I'm surprised numbers low considering many cases Scientists doctors literally said would happen future wave months ago first wave population follow social distancing rules. doctors nurses burned hospitals almost full 3 big indoor holidays right around corner. 

All politicians getting lucky get reinforces belief bad. complete failure leadership country. It’s like “freedom live life risk” know, like everyday go world, even pandemic. Also worth mentioning around one fourth people recover fully another one fifth patients develop sort mental illness following 3-months... (I'm unsure much groups overlap.) ""low"" mortality aside joke.  vacinnes taken years develope pass safety tests now?? sudden safely roll new vacinnes months? country effectively coming another public sector pay freeze last decade.

So yeh trial patients? know there's places US thing, right? I'm glad considering live lake Michigan lol

But yeah interesting thought. Oh America, say, do. Russian vaccine uses human strain adenovirus , oxford vaccine uses monkey variant.

The Russian version something attack cells, concern immune system learns stop receptors adenovirus strain adenovirus body stops virus used introduce Coronavirus. 

The oxford version receptors work human cells, Coronavirus part compatible. result immune system focuses key identifier Coronavirus adenovirus.

Public health dangers one reason state borders legally closed. US massive, many individual states small, 25 lower populations NZ.

With borders closed states could adopted elimination strategy NZ used. real problem US lack island, lack trust government lack compliance public health orders. Even liberal California movement fell 50% March lockdown. NZ movement fell 90% 90% public support measures. true Victoria's successful lockdown. 

NZ's willingness comply measures something saw yesterday take public transport across Auckland. Even though case community transmission months 5 local cases last month, govt last week made masks compulsory Auckland public transport added safety measure case. hour's journey trains buses saw 1 person wearing mask even though essentially enforcement.

Isolation Covid positive people needs enforced, recommended. seeing people follow recommendations regard Thanksgiving travel on. enough people get vaccine (ie almost everybody), 70% probably good enough. citing difference say New Zealand US unapt. point let life go back normal, point NZ susceptible disease anybody else. Sorry repeating, wanted mention 60 minutes last night, topic “long-haulers,” end, interviewed Dr. Mary Fowkes , Neuropathology Autopsy Director Mt. Sinai. end episode, announced died heart attack week prior show airing. wondering anyone else caught found jarring, top seeing hearing many symptoms long-haulers? 66 apparently loved baking, still... imagine coverage (faster production, easier transport) would make difference efficacy Oxford's Pfizer/Moderna vaccines, right?  Especially exponential spread. Rebrand CCC Camp, complete shovels, hammers, lots fresh air. Economy great, didn’t see pay go I? results probably even Pfzier vaccine already distributed massive scale. Makes wonder 1/3 dose followed full dose would better work well. I’m negative, denialist, anything else causes gang pile social media.
I’m ASKING!
90% efficacy rate vaccine, definitely great news
General 0.66% mortality rate C19
Our bodies actually, technically, better resisting C19 viable vaccine point.
Yeah?
Which doesn’t negate fact apparently absolutely suck actually treating active virus. problem, seems, isn’t fatality rate virus. problem treatment plans we’ve devised date, healthcare systems/hospitals still run grave risk overwhelmed therefore causing chaos calamity re: C19 also across range medical conditions emergencies requiring hospital services.

About right? 
(I guess best really ask opinion:consensus. trust practically media/information source statement sadly includes WHO. We’re much information technology society, podcast I’m currently includes segment titled “Why aren’t smart think are” feel says well anything else.) big terms people data sets want see basis number? aware long human trials generally lasted vaccines deemed safe? aware longest period time vaccination side effects happening vaccine ever tested? causation according conclusion study several others.

Meanwhile actual article... researcher\] cautioned findings **don't prove causality** ""keep flat footed goombahs washington hair""

[""hurry federal bailout  bother reasoning idiot. I'm sure sister bride going bury uncle daddy soon enough. Wow cities picking slack shitty rural America capacity too? shocker. pick boot straps stop eating avocado toast? basically dead life support systems they're hooked to. mortality rate would lot higher pandemic happened 70 years ago 

Without modern medicine, virus kills around 1/4 rate Spanish Flu, two three times contagious. like starter dose full later think full dose double dose later. type messaging winning Europe North America. Early pandemic media, public health leaders implanted belief elimination impossible. think vaccine weeks away actually working us, people see signal let guard now, help way. Contribute =/= drive, point article making. Small gatherings scapegoated major vector astronomical growth cases little evidence suggesting that.

In fact, difficult pinpoint major vector all. can't read article, make rash judgments many epidemiologists far less certain, saying little evidence suggest household gatherings source majority infections since summer. Indeed, become much harder pinpoint source outbreak, virus widespread Americans may exposed many ways. die unnecessarily die enough people get vaccinated, happens every year flu accept it. efficacious vaccine I'd hope COVID much less common seasonal flu morbidity mortality either less comparable seasonal flu.

This sensible stance. exactly set expectations right fall trap later thinking need eradicate COVID lock again. Different vaccine post 3.5k assume wrong factor 100. It’s really unlikely someone wrong that’s clear it’s daily number. History kind us. Future generations may accept ineptitude selfishness fail keeping *ourselves* safe. prisoners are, well, captive audience. Trump send ship anyway, blame captain ship gets wrecked marooned. Yup. quit. 
 
Risking health job stupid. Expect Dewine sit fucking hands lecture people again. Spineless coward, hope SOOO MUCH. I've watching YouTube tours Disneyland Disney world. want end year isolation bringing kids Disney park. I'm sure others planning packed worse normal. wonder good vacccine news last weeks working us, people thinking ""Well vaccine soon, let guard now."" Unexpected Bob Ross Hmm, 418 deaths age group 15-24yr 231,197 total.

What exactly getting fucking over? Sure hell job kind support all. Ubi COV19 testing worker, truly dismayed sheer unwillingness American pubic heed messages scientific community.

It's going pretty, folks. think way virus travel, significant portion population takes air road, travelling long distance deliver it. 

Not good, good. consumers really choice depending live? here...in fact, first ED EMS employees started getting quarantined, changed policy pull PTO. Granted, work small rural system massive coverage area progressive. say system done lot great things us, definitely still stings. /s?.. read comment? saying would safe better show solitary cant abstaining anyway. mean, main issue seems USA protecting economy protecting lives, rather anything healthcare system itself. useless, less useful obviously testing jump 50% 10 days. 

I would encourage think things bit more. Rain wet Minority outcomes directly correlated increased mobility (less ability work home) density (more likely live smaller homes people). said covid, except *know* negative consequences.

Either way, vaccinated? travelling. Well UK vaccinations mandatory school enrollment. interest vaccinations become mandatory American schools? aware this.

I understand public health issue, guess point I'd make would point quickly taking sides issue without consideration pros/cons. fact, almost mandatory vaccines common sense position perspective cons, pros. Surely see great policy position? Everything scrutinised period.

Do think can't bit healthy suspicion without loony? greatly concerns regards future already damaged online discourse mean kinda common sense someone living NYC careful someone interacts 20 people week lives woods?

They vastly different circumstances. NYC great infection rates low relax restrictions. spike need pull back. thing applies rural areas although harder spread less population density 8 year law student zero qualifications run vents save lives. Respiratory Therapists don’t go trade school, mostly Bachelor’s degrees. them, certification used require AA degree, longer, it’s 4 year degree. 

And anyway, someone goes trade school learn demand skill make good, livable wage? 

What point even trying make? really expecting thread end /r/agedlikemilk year.

I ecstatic I’m wrong, optimistic. live bluest blue, course majority anti vaxxers see new age hippie types rather redneck trumpets. there's still lot anti vax stuff right wing spectrum, and, given difference scientific literacy, possibly total. Let's forget, COVID treatment China free anyone right now. think hospitals get paid well. issues inefficiencies, fact people treated never end paying, plain obfuscation idea insurance really paying hospital. Oh price gouging providers/middlemen various medical devices/instruments.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: Essentially paid lot little left anyways. overcharging. system broken hell. see would count 'paid well' though saying. Ding ding ding exactly it. I'm dubbed essential, contracting power company, long I've got work Monday Tuesday Wednesday, bet ass I'm going celebrate family friends Thursday Thanksgiving.

You can't expect work like everything normal, go home quarantine I'm working. Triaging focusing care people likely recover. *not* focusing care away people based actions they've taken. Wow lowering pay??? economy sagging overall? still need fly somewhere Thanksgiving. Everyone stay home can't exposed. think doctors allowed refuse Covid treatment people get vaccine (unless they're minor legit medical reason get it). *you* did? claims? Drug companies idea effective large trials, that's they're saying effective. There's big difference ""promising candidate"" drug companies look ""effective"" drug companies can't test they've already given thousands people. sounds much better initial number 70%, would chance choose think would No. 1 choice great explanation. Unfortunately I'll take I'll get EU &amp; government, I'm complaining either way, can't wait get vaccinated. Except read article, are. Really bad headline.  reddit putting side don’t like Trump’s team. Pay attention them. Same! Thanks confirming this! much want get grouchy people traveling, think overlooked part picture. am, lot spread among college kids; they're going home (away parties, etc) may dire people expect. one hand could argue yes. government responsibility look own, bit selfishness respective countries expected vaccine mean slow return economic growth. 

I would struggle see countries allowing US go ahead US whole incredibly poor dealing covid. Especially look president handled craziness “anti-maskers”. I'll get eventually.

I'm worried though. work home, risk, yeah go golf go get brunch every awhile. outdoors activities.

I'm 28 risk. I'll wait long feel necessary get it. Two irresistible indoor holidays. Despite accurate reputation drinking, Utah exactly known self restraint. (See: gourmet soda drive-thrus *add* sugar Coca-Cola)

Utah soooooooo screwed. :-(

All family live there. I'm worried. tragic. Wait US?!?!?!?!?!? I'm much pro vaccine know makes somewhat uncomfortable. Makes sense though. yeah, AZ's adenovirus based.

&amp;#x200B;

i get injecting higher viral load might best solution.

you're standing wall.

**Why Oxford’s positive COVID vaccine results puzzling differences bona fide, researchers eager understand why. “I don’t think it’s anomaly,” says Katie Ewer, immunologist Oxford’s Jenner Institute working vaccine. “I’m keen get lab start thinking address question.” two leading theories lower first dose might led better protection COVID. It’s possible lower doses vaccine better job stimulating subset immune cells called cells support production antibodies, says.   potential explanation immune system’s response chimpanzee virus. vaccine triggers immune response SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, also components viral vector. It’s possible full first dose blunted reaction, says Ewer. plans look antibody responses chimpanzee virus help address question.

# Benefits good dead   Oh sure, spreads like Swine Flu close million Americans die. point beginning lot fear came people thought transmission would like seeing now, ALONG CFR SARS MERS range. Americans expecting Hollywood style pandemic got real world pandemic. didn’t think China would quarantine hundreds millions people unless Hollywood style pandemic. clarify, sounds like saying saying like double negative.

So p value 0.01 would suggest exact opposite. error semantics fundamental misunderstanding statistics? seems like OP understands low p value means study design good, suggests strong likelihood correlation/causation two things experiment. That's wince many people talk unmasking going back normal soon get vaccine. initially, later year. US probably choices anyone else. meant choices countries pick rather individual consumers obvious reasons countries. according covid CFR 1-3 percent, therefore need socially distance wear mask.

Well, shooting people paintballs CFR less 1 percent. shoot anti-maskers paintballs. lol. Don’t cave. doesn’t prevent covid. guarantee still enough antibodies. So, worth risk. doesn’t even hide anymore. stance Covid isn’t big deal unless you’re old shape. Young healthy immune systems kick quickly (see Young Jamie) 
Biden moron, Trump much needed breath fresh air. Newsom sucks. Seattle hippie commune. ways right ways. can’t even listen anymore he’s exactly complains about. 
That guys fucking meat-head son.  Man, used love madlibs type. This. 100% board taking vaccine, slightly apprehensive produced quickly long term effects somewhat unknown. Visceral fat indeed stored around organs fucking lol believe anyone without chiseled face visceral fat. Jeremih typical neck black afroamericans get they're higher bodyfat scale. 
just look pic him: typical inflammed face someone lots visceral fat. 
I sorry cannot see it. start noticing can't unsee it. 
Just look older pics leaner. Easier said done. families going let grandpa grandma sit sidelines alone thanksgiving everyone else time lives. every company stupid go money customers :) That's still even true, though. ill-fitting N95 still preferable nothing. 

They started immediately preaching people even cloth masks made home effective. new science, all. sub really become bunch old homebodies friends never left house begin yelling wind.
 
*People something like! News 11!* way knowing whether got half, full placebo dose think Huh? Throughout life, show proof vaccination various activities. college, needed proof meningitis vaccination order live dorms. high school, needed proof vaccinations volunteer local hospital. 

You liberty give loved ones disease. find dystopian number people fixated individual liberties completely willing kill others pursue fake version freedom. Yes good reason despite great reasons they've sabatoged credibility good number people. want hermitry stay coffee go. Gritty sad. ½ people screaming satanic conspiracy theory

½ mad max style thunderdome violence people fight get first know two hospitals full right name quite people know dont care all. “Can” ? Another stupid title ! Oh okay, one freedumb people. explains it. participants, likely placebo, survived sadly)

Do know sure? people voluntarily become indicted help vaccine development died, Churchills ""never much owed many few"" line regarding battle Britain, became date.  link articles people volunteering exposed? usually massive no-no medical ethics surprised even thing. morality letting someone knowingly infect potentially deadly disease seems pretty cut dry so... Sounds absurd me. bed sick lerson, matter live? I'm sure I'm missing. say all. Right. 

 Anyways, everybody luxury. reread comment carefully report back? enough doctors nurses fill regular hospitals. Brutal Yeah, could care less rural areas get F’ed wife together 14 years, married 10 2 kiddos. first year least since married staying home Thanksgiving 4 us. 

Please responsible holiday season stay home. way meet family next year instead losing year one tell leather. article Mayo Clinic Health System. thought talking *the* Mayo Clinic. Although I'm sure Mayo Clinic Rochester similar situation Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Year's celebrations. True. I’ve experienced loss happy watch church online. quite limitations study, sums pretty well: 

Only 46% volunteers mask group told researchers followed rules wearing masks public, 47% said “predominantly” wore masks, 7% said didn’t follow rules.

*In words, journal editors noted, “the study examined effect recommending mask use, effect actually wearing them.”*

The CDC said early masks ""wouldn't work."" also admitted saying want people take already-limited supply away healthcare workers. plenty research shows *do* work, thought one main reasons many Asian countries able control virus much effectively. see people valved masks respirators unfiltered exhaust time, drives nuts. 

It's simple enough add filter material exhalation port. wear cloth mask respirator, tape filter port. makes bit humid inside respirator, winter dryness might plus.

Edit: grocery shopping anxiety lessened since picked respirator month ago. Plus, go hiking without worrying stupid outdoor allergies. look ridiculous, nose run. always ""wild west"" US, never stopped. Gotta watch back, no-one trusted, gotta ready fight death called 'yella' I've taking vitamin daily since first heard benefits fighting covid back Feb/March. people reporting this? Oh man, happened US, would ""get covid"" parties. doubt it.

I know practically already are. $ incentive? Especially younger peeps. would disaster. Maybe ask nicely Canada could send ship. Might bribe bottle maple syrup 6 pack Molson’s, though. need coughing offing morning coffee Hahahah why? even know Carlos Slim is? haven’t erected national guard field hospitals help care people? fuck FEMA? pay taxes state federal government doesn’t shit help people? Curbside pickup great option, free. people general want something, gonna hard time imposing it. Especially western country values things like civil rights. think I'm going make big loop drop stuff off. know quarantined high risk right now. I've really limiting trips freezer full. Time cook stuff drop off.  totally get traveling family big getting together holidays reality extremely selfish. reality lives line. Look personally I'm worried getting (although complications people get pretty scary...) killing family pretty good health. also recognize bring work, store, anywhere else, could cause someone's death aftermath.

&amp;#x200B;

You want think like that, reality families. Sometimes people never meet who's lives depend upon us giving holiday one year.

&amp;#x200B;

Now people risk family things? cannot fathom risk lives event like this. think many cases people horrendously bad understanding risk sorts situations.

&amp;#x200B;

That said hope safe Thanksgiving. Good testing isolating, whole lot others do. also directed specifically, apologize came overly harsh. deeply disturbed new era? **Success**? Also curfews impossibility meet houses think it’s really makes difference, restaurants (but probably bars) IMO  mean since I’m phase 3 trial us participants heard given full strength doses? got first dose last tuesday? Yea messaging place. family want hear anymore cause they're getting told different things time. I'm trying simplify best want listen. wish consistency every county state thing explain them. 

It's like designating one area pool take piss hope best. heard analogy friend today. yet brought entirely upon falsely arguing Denmark away mink industry.

That pretty surreal attempt defending Swedens inaction. vaccine stops Covid-19, Moderna/Pfizer. CDC recommend everyone check Vitamin levels? care anyone? mean, believe science

/s change attitude people think Bill Gates trying microchip everyone... people get standard vaccines.

&amp;#x200B;

we also mass transit anywhere world hours.

we also internet.. quality information impossible control.

&amp;#x200B;

oh, several BILLION people 1918 Agree. like Qantas' rules, business Qantas 100% agree. saying get it? mean that's figured implied last message. ok, fam. beat bad! enforceable? Genuine question Google CDC’s “shielding method”. It’s good one. everybody luxury

Sure do. easy. small number people risk work starve, people pretend that's case actually want inconvenienced lesser greater degrees. think grocery shopping + thanksgiving dinners cause spread grocery shopping. think? Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* become island located arse end world less 5 million people. I’ve family since March. doubt Murphy another lockdown isn’t enough federal money support it. lol comment pops time massive upvotes, shows mentally weak everyone sub is.

if reading sub makes u feel bad, dont look it. like stalking ur ex hoping gets fat instead stoping stalk her. FDA approving month phizer? way island size USA, moron. I'm really curious big impact shift towards remote white collar work going suburban economy. significant reduction number people commuting cities result, reduction associated service workers also commuting support that, going shunt commuting bigger freeways meandering suburban roads? army medic monitor vitals? administer IV's? Every analysis? Really? article itself. cannot said smaller private gatherings friends family. Colorado, 81 active cases attributed social gatherings, compared 4,000 correctional centers jails, 3,300 colleges universities, nearly 2,400 assisted living facilities, 450 restaurants, bars, casinos bowling alleys.  Louisiana, social events account 1.7 percent 3,300 cases state clear exposure information. pharmacies sign advertising it. Maybe state weird rule let carry it? Family doctors treat kids adults MMR, too. Every country ravaged. forgetting Australia, New Zealand, Vietnam, others. I’ve said repeatedly, NYC controlled virus lockdown wasn’t close China’s without surveillance app. mean since I’m us trial receive two full strength doses? took first shot last week liberal governor republican. recommend Thanksgiving grocery shopping...??? No, didn't.

Which think likely cause spread?? Wow, Kansas really cutting edge science here. everybody luxury. change system works going happen weeks months. It'll take years. Meanwhile, people lost homes everything due working.  


 everybody gets work home. know I'm NEVER buying plane tickets months advance flight ever again. spent thousands last January lost everything trip never happened. I'm flying I'm buying tickets week. 40,000 compared size entire human population. I'll let millions others beta test thing 6 months i'll feel confident taking it.  mindset. real law situation. 

Internment confinement without legal recourse new untested USA. Ask kids crossing border, muslims airports, Japanese Americans WWII, first Americans colonization expansion. Real question. make sure everyone world get vaccine like this? Im ready start giving money poor people get help too, want vaccines American Bristish whatever, would like start donating less wealthy. possible? senate even consider passing stimulus bill doesn’t completely protect corporations sued sick employees loved ones dead employees.

Repubs senate blocked stimulus 6 months supporters didn’t waver undying support. even lose one seat election far? confirmed blocl stimulus long want won’t face political consequences. bad feeling Pelosi Dems eventualy concede pass stimulus bill makes illegal sue employers killed family. failed geography, math science?

Impressive! masks also protect YOU, around you, unless put sort mask exhalation port, otherwise jets possible germs... people traveling aren’t “done” never took precautions. can’t fatigue didn’t anything.  don’t know sure. viruses case. exposed, would likely carry low level virus short time, theoretically possible could spread others. hell jump much EIGHT DAYS?! Americans density starts thighs. federal government jack shit, let's serious. one branch government still actively spreading conspiracy theories, another half branch government worried election slamming judges rather coming stimulus relief package.

At point understand make choice off...

1. shit load people poor going evicted

or

2. catastrophic collapse state's hospital system, would result far deaths 1) would.

You two shit sandwiches, eat one tastes less like shit. None good options, ones states left.  didn’t get read removed clue. Check edit last comment there, bub. added submission. 

And bringing death rates provide evidence lockdowns pointless, harm good. Lockdowns destroying economy, they're destroying people's lives, mental health, actual health. People dying lockdowns, price increasing. 

The cure worse problem Germany 1930's. Depending Georgia McConnell could end another skin sack concentrated evil stubborn fucking die. Even things back normal I'll probably need psilocybe cubensis assisted therapy NYC 30% city immune. nothing worry second wave, overwhelm hospitals. Still, ""95% efficacy"" - would suck careful whole thing, get vaccine, still end 1/20 get anyways. mean -- probably taught basic probabilities everywhere. need complicated decimal point mitigation.

You 10 blocks cup. 9 green, 1 red. Shake blocks someone gets red one. What's that? 4 got red block first try? Congrats covid. Looks like mask mandate super effective. That's preaches United States. Bloody hell. nightmare. can’t writing, anti maskers big readers. u/FatOrangeCat42 d00mer's excuses be? Winning! hotspot church really encouraging Covid restrictions. Everyone watches sermon home people talking either filmed home demonstrating good social distancing mask wearing.

I understand pastors churches flagrantly dismiss dangers human life. boggles mind, honestly. Willing bet kind person leaves food spilled restaurant floor ""so workers something do."" Trump nothing gain vaccine anymore, election over, lost. Great, 2 weeks US get first batch. Well that’s also grandparents idiots well. Don’t get together family holiday season unless already live them. Yea still buddy, even know people thought Sweden trying herd immunity looked Sweden sub. iv said, iv since virus first appeared. live? What's agenda? Please spread viewpoint family friends even friends friends. ""We've always war eastasia"" Backyard park, outdoor get together. masks. don’t slobber hang indoors hours. 

The last 7 months, nice out, seeing family, indoor gatherings.  German vaccine? Alexa, works Arlington department communication legislative affairs, suggested family’s story could provide honest teachable moment reach residents Spanish-speaking communities. family members recorded videos speaking directly camera, English Spanish. bluntly described consequences gathering implored people act differently. really screwed situation. People putting life line ""essential workers"" need protected something happens, case, compensation needs provided. 

Workers expendable replaceable cogs. State benefits minimum compensation IMO. you’d comfortable passing someone is? Minnesota like Germany. enough beds help neighboring states like South Dakota, North Dakota Wisconsin control. sucks middle states NOTHING curb spread. People dumb af here. confirm. Think get frustrated. really mean it. many sick people turn MUH RIGHTS thing man. That’s enemies want. want us fight virus gets worse worse topples economy can’t come together fight thing. sit bickering fall deeper deeper hole. yes, problem. You’re blathering idiot. many you. don’t even know point. look make yourself? You’re selfish entitled prick. Fuck it’s frustrating many people like are. wish virus would anti mask anti lockdown fucktards. U , lol. cant answer that. tell point. r/philosophy Seriously? mean could mask entry sign . *Shrugs* Certainly me. live here.........begrudgingly. fast friend.

My comment information coming Trump's administration. thought going end Easter election. 

However, listening Fauci credible sources, would agree. I'd happily first line Pfizer vaccine. Like said, properly trialed. They’ve admitted couple years ago think. I’ve even seen videos BBC journalist touring one places. It’s hard say genunine footage was, looked like adult school basically learn patriotic. heard official investigation UN, may take time - would vetoed it’s security council measure. family believed weren’t engaging risky behavior associated coronavirus, like going bars restaurants, even congregating church, Alexa said. Everyone growing fatigued isolation, said, wanted see like always have. governments Europe also way late steps really helped spreading. virus hitting Italy, countries like Netherlands, Belgium, Germany kinda let happen, even though everyone knew following curve Italy, weeks behind. Going see that, many deaths populations exploited fashion. Here's latest charts pattern seen elsewhere. 7-day charts tell tale. Cases spiked deaths following suit. Think state borders inAus akin country borders.

Yet managed it. Black tags.  

Lots lots black tags. It’s sad people need order responsible. really need start teaching better critical thinking skills people school. It’s absolutely stupid situation. There’s literally penalty taking gap year. you’re accepted school defer. It’s big deal whatsoever. Ever met Australian? nearly take couple years (or during) university.

Nobody send kids school. don’t need credits badly. Grades aren’t even real thing, it’s arbitrary value assigned people could generally care less.

None point. Nobody needs die homework. never reason shove everyone next school year, really.  Thank you. read research article. 

The observation mask mandates counties Kansas could either correlation causation. point I’m trying make quarantine 3-5 days, go testing site, get test, go immediately home (I.e. don’t “share needles friend”), quarantine social event (still going sharing needles) reasonably sure that—assuming test negative—I won’t infect anyone social event. You’re arguing someone could get sick testing site. possible, although probably extremely unlikely. testing sites near outdoors and/or drive thru. 

I didn’t argue could get tested go grocery store, get sick, go social event. I’m capable comprehending “point time” measurement. point time time week you’ve contact another human, reasonably assume aren’t going infect next person come contact with. true get toxicity likely occur level supplementation people otherwise healthy. main negative level supplementation associated increased falls elderly.

But generally 2000-3000 bring without known negative side effects I've quarantining due positive covid result closet days, clothes safe wear thrown washer quarantine (only laundry last couple days tried avoid touching closet since going anywhere). zero faith anything current admin says anything. That's pfizer telling investors. swallow story. Like many pandemics (plague 1346, 1510/1781/1918 flu pandemics, Asian flu, Hong Kong flu, H5N1&amp;H5N6 influenzas, SARS 2003), Covid-19 started China brought Italy Wuhan couple (asymptomatic?) authorities add asymptomatic presymptomatic cases country's official list confirmed cases.

In government statement latest Covid-19 outbreak China’s Kashgar city Tuesday, five confirmed cases 178 without symptoms tested positive.

I would feel bad wasting resources I'm sure worst part video 1) Priests nose hanging mask 2) Incense smoke filling room people struggling breathe 3) Spraying holy water room important looking computers. Another article behind paywall. Grrr McConnell out? Exactly Absolutely. Senator Cornyn Trump cult. NAU, title misleading, probably read article, comments. boring fall hard did. Cool, fun part pandemic start, there's room anywhere death rate starts spike due fact. Moratility 2.5% .... whilst everyone needs get's place hospital, ~10% people need medical attention luck then, bad .... where's next Rona-Party going on? need pardy hard spread germs ... /s What's wrong public gyms? something similar! couple families cook, portion food sharing others, door exchange masks, food reheated home, get eat delicious food, put one risk. SIMPLE.  Yes, this! lived South FL 8 years much culture, great food, incredible art scene tons really wonderful people. Please throw Floridians (and transplants) one pot.
Granted, definitely lot assholes reckless people too. Ok, sociopath. get sick That's huge demographic though. percent population 18-49? Cool, guess.

The fact decided peruse comment history telling.

I, hand, really care post, what.

But answer burning question that's apparently taking important rent space head:

Since choice matter frontline workers, guinea piggies matter what, then, matter think it?

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT - heads post opinions headlines only. dont read articles time - I'm busy WORKING. Im interested engaging discussions musings, kind wasting time engagement. West pacific includes East Asia, South-east Asia, South-south Asia (Oceania). Yet middle part, South-east Asia, picked out. Wierd. know talking about.

You saying opposite CDC saying.

You right make reckless decisions effect health safety others. mean separations I'm aware personally, man worked woman soccer practice laundry going teacher meetings such. they're spending time together finding somewhere last years grew changed separately they're nest stranger. Plus add financial strain homeschooling. Sorry, know nothing stocks, saying it’s $48.52 share? buy one share? look up/buy from? Serious question, happens get 1 dose Pfizer's vaccine? Kind reminds 9/11 first responders fight coverage support. late, millions people traveling, autocratic campaigns useless It’s really alone bothers me. It’s whole family mad joining them, worrying repercussions time together.  wait 3 weeks  miss wife, 2 year old, tested positive. south Florida. Luckily daughter isn’t symptomatic, wife dealing fevers body aches day night. 

Stay fuck home.

EDIT: wife preschool teacher bartend hotel. don’t luxury able work home. announced bar picture closing back down, open one weekend! First world problems. Tell folks die. No, American wave started Europe. accurately, American wave never stopped.  tests approaching time high 2 million day positivity rate flattening 10% Sobering true. wish everyone America could put beliefs covid aside 10 minutes read wrote. kind looking forward going manage that. good portion base anti-vaxxers spent 6 months telling everyone thing dangerous flu.  pivot ""you need get vaccinated immediately"" going interesting. never able look neighbors co-workers same.

I know feeling. used fun looking social media, depressing see many people irresponsible, many people FIGHTING advice politely ask what's right. really gonna recover this. They'll smiles daisies I'll never look way again. course didn't, one wears masks EXACTLY. Hey- hear we’re experiencing global pandemic? It’s type mentality that’s reason high numbers right now. baby summer still haven’t seen friends family I’ve survived. 

I’m really happy people family gatherings, enjoyed hugely, people, don’t get see mine. took comparison way nose

COVID isn’t mono. monologue pointless period meth gators causing havoc tear towns desperate search meth fend withdrawal. actually isolated brief period

So want places lockdown 8 months? Lockdowns don’t work unless western countries aren’t small island countries. vaccine different getting Covid. Literally articles mentioned state one knows long immunity last. sourcing writing two different things. Right know, people collapsing front us streets 24/7

Besides wearing mask, stores pretty much operating normal...  I've saying wife since around April May:

""The pandemic revealed 2 types people life: people never see again, people never WANT see again."" Sadly, family seems filling latter, feel stupid actions cause everyone else begin filling former.  Except decent part people town. Politicians can't act numbers rise. truly boggles mind man worry. people worried rushed vaccine (none hold medical degree, btw, know people doctors nurses, none worried swiftly-created nature vaccine) becoming minority. months ago, half population, they're 42%. DEAD DOVE DONT EAT  read novel somebody said transfer non covid patients non covid patient died. I'm reading anything hospitals actually full covid patients.

I'm also curious respiratory virus sticks around year arent dead antivirals. NYers absolutely go Times Square NYE, unless office already want stick around. 

The actual event tourists.

Prior covid though, Times Square movie theatres real gems, since residents never go Times Square unless necessary tourists often go movies. Everywhere look, Trump tv talking numbers.

Except covid numbers, voting numbers. that’s ever cares about. Rip tiktoker’s/youtuber’s favorite dine-in BOA steakhouse Please god let people take fucking vaccine let’s move on! agree you, one problem first sentence talk “the hard-core pre-Covid anti-VAX crowd”. 

Hasn’t crowd dramatically increased last years? Thank you. postponed first time back March realized it’s hands. part keep others safe. Hopefully larger gathering June possibility. age group like .005 something  way hell let Times Square ball drop happen way normally does. Yeah there's comic convention Fort Myers weekend. advertisements asking people come visit Alabama oh, crazy! Florida owns name “laughingstock”. socialized Healthcare system

This everywhere Europe has. France England even better, tbh. 100% free healthcare shorter queues. one lying. person knows it, doesn’t want get blamed getting whole family sick. individual probably feels guilty hell.

If follow rules properly get it. Always wearing mask, maintaining distance, staying inside one space someone outside “family pod” long. I’ve seen said takes 10 - 15 minutes hanging someone without mask get sick them, hours mask on.

If everyone followed rules gathered would non-issue none would sick.

But one didn’t follow rules, got it, family violated gathering rule got everyone else sick. Yeah, OP spamming mink fear.

Sorry, point valid. reduce risk MISC Yeah. Sponsored studies paid airlines It’s don’t believe outside media real life nothing happening So, I'm understanding saying, essentially comes doctors seeing people? solution that's a) spend less time patients b) get doctors? 

What happens doctor seen gone another two hours? Obviously every situation same, frustrating sitting waiting room, opinion.

I've heard really terrible things hospital live, honestly tell experienced normal. Ok bro, god forbid anyone changes anything life global pandemic. 

Obvious troll obvious. Ok makes sense Hopefully. Maybe really obscure Indian irredentism? Claiming South-east Asia part Indosphere due historic cultural religious First, let preface saying we've following social distancing protocol (we're perfect, I'd put us least 60th percentile), fully understand important so, limit spread.

However, agree travel restrictions right now. half-assed, months literally nothing, politicians beg us stay put trying sell us importance bars Mom Pop shop reselling cheap furniture staying open right (instead putting things place support families actually limit spread) just... Absolute bullshit. We're travelling, blame people are. Yes. infectious. 99 companies 20 countries put banned list. detected beef *Brazil* well.

I think risk contracting frozen food low; said one confirmed case understand risk/reward ratio really whack this. test available wasting resources country in? Definitely going let memory. small campus work already decided go virtual Thanksgiving despite covid case numbers relatively low(in comparison lot colleges state, least) wonder many schools follow suit numbers absolutely going explode coming weeks. Oh, sure. They'll publically disavow policy ends unpopular. They're politicians, that's do. like, surely someone terrible track record kept far possible government? absolved crimes committed say sorry admit wrong. Let die. Actually, will. die eventually today could last. saying That's criticism better levied towards Africa. Zingy, accurate. It’s excuse insensitive ass, come home college valid reason flying. fly literally stranded kicked campus “sob story.” Believe people different circumstances you. Ohayo gozaimasu, mate. know many? encourage tithing remain relevant lives congregations. No, get encourage people spread deadly disease claim moral superiority personally following rules.

Edit: literally nothing uncivil comment. Grow balls stop encouraging bullshit artists, mods. know people social anxiety around people super uncomfortable them? people get symptoms alone. I'm saying justifies parties/gatherings whatever. I'm saying long epidemic already people isolation like torture. Sure, dont get pass that, least try sympathize little.  think CDC acting like You-Know-Who ended winning instead You-Know-Who. Given ambitious timeline, suspect AstraZeneca vaccine close unveiling data. Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine available enough doses come end December early January justify timeline, therefore things must looking good AZ vaccine.  standard explanation protests like BLM lead covid outbreaks everybody protests outdoors wearing masks. certainly social distancing protests. 

So now, outdoors wearing masks enough prevent covid? consistency? Interesting! I’ll read this. Thank you! 😄  exact situation taught every first aid course. come across car accident multiple victims. alone, know help way 30 mins get there.

The community leaders trying public appeal, got interviewed we’ll see happens. countries care. Florida managed stay 22nd state list Total cases per million population?

with sheer recklessness, portrayed media anyway, would thought top list - middle... ""unprovable"". could tested, think testing might end kind human rights violation. Nobody ever said safe. sure survey brings verifiable research particular use case, point matter people (both symptomatic asymptomatic) got together massive droves, mobilized around town, yelled, shouted, chanted, got tear gassed/pepper sprayed LE, would cough spit (saliva sometimes blood result), got bruised/scraped rough housing, mean list goes on.

I’m politically independent, fact matter 12-person indoor restaurant gathering (Gavin Newsom) got scrutiny protests saw nationwide. Accountability needs go ways. Think stupid average person is, realize half stupider that. -- George Carlin Bad bot posts coronavirus response political politicized heavily. .....that know of. Early outbreak 14 days something like 2std deviation (99%) upper bound incubation period. I’m sure latest science, it’s probably close.

14 days guarantee. Adding testing improves tests turn positive incubation periods. Keep south take parents table next week. people happy take risk. ones vulnerable also ones least time left planet. would rather risk virus denied precious time loved ones. think people driving lol get New Zealander Christmas Islander brag easy keep pandemic control you’re remote ass island think certain kind person, raised authoritarian parents, believe follow rules without question. So, cruise lines running allowed go on, want first ones there.  Wikipedia disagrees you, China guy God complex play God one time illegal.

That's kind murderers do. Fortunately seem small minority whole good culture banding together complying. already has

NYC Seattle Wuhan level warzones peaks several major counties California came within inches boiling over. Good America “My Freedoms” trump deadly viruses. Every state Australia implemented inter-state travel restrictions point another. We're starting relax them. ""So told people, slow testing down""

The real tragedy somewhere tests wanted could saved lives. worst thing states municipalities actually refusing testing due lack tests, usually send people simptoms previous contact confirmed cases homes *ask politely social distancing.* 


I people family got infected, refused test people contact person due enough tests. 


There's way second wave dont testing, amirite? can't law written make illegal? incredibly abusive power differential single individual huge corporation state department. mean study like would massive ethical issues would probably make blatantly illegal never approved REB, without minors board. family members would rather take risk see see 7 months. people assess risk differently. die, die. 

I believe people ability, right assess risk, act accordingly It’s definitely sad, especially widows others lost loved ones self quarantine. Music festivals back!!! thought knowing family 10 people got bad. One people family died Friday. already announced closing doors 2021 last month; sad see iconic company go history fur trade forgotten I've reading stories months sympathy left. know better. Stay home.  went drive around town get house afternoon happened pass Covid testing site. line cars waiting went across parking lot, street, block, around corner, halfway another block! I'm city much lower case count percent positive tests US. know means local case count explode whole lot people getting tested ahead travel, sight MANY cars lined tests really rattled me. next couple months get so, much worse, they. It’s crazy lock things instead thinking “wow getting pretty serious,” lot people, many people thinking “wow better take party inside” Source hearing insiders? Makes glad I’m 21 brain. Stay safe everyone. design production issues; end users. Fort Liquordale It’s fun games last defense straight gives rest us. us retarded making worse them, many sit back watch governments tell defenders pound sand. Remember. walk away whenever want. Yeah, doesn’t take much. takes death equivalent almost 100 9/11s less year good chance permanent organ damage. Crazy people might concerned either things, right? fair- supposed know serious COVID is?? It’s like anyone ever talked anywhere it’s ever happened anyone. Costco enforcing masks nationwide, regardless local laws. membership chain, much easier them.. lost friend COVID-19 “hoax”. joined Facebook 4 months pandemic got sucked right kinds bizarre conspiracy theories. crap could believe, Covid-19 worse flu. make matters worse, daughter nurse Arizona. haven’t spoken since March. hope she’s okay. Done $1200 meant ""survival"" money, stimulus check dump money economy. Yup, China population 1.3 billion, far, package human happened like 5 times? two doses whim, adds enormous extra amount logistical issues would rather avoid could. probably determined phase 2 without two doses, vaccine reliably initiate enough antibody response ensure reasonable level protection. know they're worried long term effects. usually ask means, exactly. waiting year evidence? 2 years? actually help us now? Lol. somehow makes better? worked years large physicians billing office. know system works, outside system do. unconscionable need stop saying system works. feel guilty. It’s like haven’t warned months shit. wish harm there’s pity here- saved ones actually cautious still catch it. Okay, let rephrase that. arrested proof played god? Dear Penthouse, 

I usually wear mask but, decided naughty go face naked. Boy surprised got deadly disease died.

\- Stupid Person know mentioned first wave hit, bought $40 bidet attachment (and high wanted way clean lady bits too), awesome. We've bought TP in...probably 7 months. many tests indication someone paranoid ? recruit 14 year olds run them. make til tok videos video chats zoom calls without manual, operating ventilator easy touch screen. confused. rebuttal essentially read news neither friends? people still want feel sorry lol live south Florida get looks time wearing mask. day went bar cousins got made fun many dirty looks. shit ridiculous Correction. Many vaccines work way, mRNA vaccines inject inert viruses. inject portion virus NYC back april ambulances even picking lot people homes letting die home lie dead hours days Riiiiight.

Because China 4,634 deaths right?

If believe I've got bridge sell you. always point 40,000 already taken issue. 70000 include vaccines. Well, there’s bad news that’s you’re counting on. two current likely vaccines, Pfizer Moderna, way reduce case numbers, slow spread. That’s vaccines do. build antibodies system person inevitably becomes infected, body think it’s already virus better able fight it. Ie, people still get virus rate hopefully effects virus reduced vaccinated we’ll fewer severe cases, fewer hospitalizations, fewer deaths. Beyond that, current vaccines designed prevent becoming infected, prevent becoming seriously ill. benefit pass someone else (and will), also vaccinated less susceptible. ones can’t vaccinated, well... Well, LA tents outside 2-3 sides closed. People households gather socialize restaurants mask-less tables inches away another table thing. It’s contributing spread infection, it’s one area government regulate close in-person dining needed. way control people gathering homes, are, leaving us make better decisions. 

Order out, stay home. Let’s done already. Worst cases 1% dies elderly preexisting conditions. Florida would survive. sure, wouldn’t know reading sub, vaccinating 50+ crowd really takes extinguish death hospitalization numbers. Thank saying that. It’s lot sacrifice barely acknowledgment people life. think I’m crazy. true even deduction. 

Yes, know that. Looking this, requested initial post. family going zoom it, something consider. Yes sucks, way appreciate next year's more. even cruises?? Lol I'm to. I'm saying cheap Never forget 9/11 Victim's Fund ran [Jon stepped shamed shit Congress something it. first time happened, last. Texans, matter party affiliation, hold government this. I'm sorry. selfish people infuriating. give shit medical workers till need one. Caveat: lot people act like idiots.
I can't say record gives much hope that. fellow South Floridian, agree completely. know mostly sarcastic people shit Florida, still hurts sometimes knowing many good/smart people around massive fucking idiots like bar-goers. honestly europeans make difference narcissism.

Every metropolitan area WORLD situation going right (with exception, likely, over-arching governments China would kill people something like this).

Ignore hate. pure ignorance. still doesnt mean healthcare workers, people virtually deserve it. Well live one awful. control freak bad flaw, put Covid constant stream MSM top ya got someone cannot stand. husband, child, I. family older. sister high risk, DVT. home stay Oh anyone family decides cook, bit lax hygiene (e.g. washing hands carefully preparing food...) Thank you! We'll try best! country / state describing?
Edit: TN Well, I'm sure always heard err side caution. I'd prefer paranoid lax contracting virus could've avoided safe sorry. like weird kind ""do say do"". can't tell someone safe go buy essentials stay safe, go bookstore, flea market, church. ""paranoid"" control situation, taking bed hospital could go someone else may unwilling getting COVID, one less patient makes assistant, nurse, doctor feel stress over. 
Can talk mod r/coronavirus deletes voted comments support agenda??? last people get one. Selfish pricks  realize people don’t spontaneously get infected, right? get infected people virus. You’re acting like it’s something randomly chance happening leave house. That’s works, like all. must edited headline reads

**Oklahoma mega-church cancels 'Friendsgiving' amid Covid spike, gives food away instead** Ah, makes okay then! Better hope burned time family need them, huh? certainly sounds like time consuming task! think really awesome exploring different avenues students, lot professors seem willing change syllabus they've worked years even always translate well online. 

In experience student I've found thing appreciate syllabus (online not) consistency throughout semester. like know ahead time details many homeworks be, many exams,  etc. professor last week sprung homework assignment us blue (it 2nd semester) honestly felt like mini project. considered HW planning time research class projects (and holiday!) got pretty frustrated. 

I wish luck trying figure things out! safe space people align party failed US miserably tragedy. want hurt feelings facts. Ah. politicians say done must mean gone can't die anymore. think People working Florida hospitals must happy behaviour people. 

I think running Darwin awards Johnson Johnson Dude, personally come back campus. dropped avoid going back would’ve lost scholarships educational progress. would nixed chance future financial aid due completing degree 4 years. would’ve bad choice ever want able support myself. 

I driving home college, many position can’t. fucking empathy. Well def cities. worse outbreak U.S. right rural midwest. find data specific area? Look state's health department website. going large gathering? indoors outdoors? people wearing masks? ways make safer, safest route gather. I've noticed people put together gatherings best intentions planned mitigation measures, people feel comfortable slips away. would nice. virus never go away make virtually nondeadly thats win. 
Can talk mod r/coronavirus deletes voted comments support agenda??? 
Can talk mod r/coronavirus deletes voted comments support agenda??? die, die Deaths. Cheers I'm sure mild.  No, we'll 95% effective vaccine widely available Yeah, honestly staying home great me. know people sociable able see friends family stressful them. Again, justifying gatherings, trying little sympathy. pandemic evolved, we’ve learned much higher risk blood clots people contract virus.""   Currently Eliquis large DVT left leg. history blood clots. ""risks"" Covid months ago. B cells still elevated. blood thinners least 6 months don’t get it, get flu shot free US too. something remarkable getting free Canada? someone please help question? I’ve wondering ages, difference emergency approval proper approval is? keep hearing emergency approval, want know timetable full approval used globally likely happen leading vaccines? anybody clue process full approval actually looks like long until? cuz company’s ad saying doesn’t mean are. 
Can talk mod r/coronavirus deletes voted comments support agenda??? Probably around Christmas time barring setbacks agree, although guys pretty funny Definitely take step back mental health. Anxiety make covid symptoms worse. Like others said, chances favor you’re going okay. 

If can’t tear away sub remember gets posted usually worst worst far headlines go. It’s norm. things go back ""normal,"" I'll never able look neighbors co-workers same.

I feel too. thought lost innocence long ago. wrong. Well, based record far taking things seriously staying ahead curve, I'm sure totally meet expectations.......

That said think really matters achieve herd immunity. long people want protected get protected lower infection rate enough big problem. even mom obese kinds medical issues got covid like month ago fine. it’s definitely anxiety anything. normally smoke weed deal anxiety i’m afraid it’s going make worse lol 😭  Yeah true. I'm South Korean, population small one sixth US population! tiny... /s
And daily cases area frighteningly soaring 300, tabloids screaming government failure.
So, how's US doing? /s We’re going hear lot stories like holidays. support criminalizing interstate travel? Arresting people crossing state lines? support jail time people wear masks?

If ---- simply deal fact (1) people traveling, (2) taking precautions, (3) taking precautions, (4) virus spread going occur.

You complain ""people taking precautions"", unless advocate criminalizing ""people taking precautions"", ROI words (and others) typed literally zero. I’m pro vaccine get don’t think it’s completely unreasonable little worried possible side effects vaccine developed around 9 months. 

There likely won’t any, it’s really unreasonable concern have. people still think hoax? 
Everyone must people family got sick... hoax.
People must know someone town died... hoax. facts simply wrong, Google individually.

Also amplifying right ”That’s really effective pivot table Sir. remember that.”

&lt;Suppressed laughter.  working well, feels like normal summer guaranteed.

Quick math: Pfizer, Moderna AstraZeneca produce 6 billion vaccines next year rate 500 million per month. enough vaccinate 250 million per month half world year. 

Many countries less need vaccine (e.g. African countries young population) harm virus eliminated targeting vaccine at-risk populations. 

Theoretically, \~300 million at-risk people vaccinated spring weather warms spread virus slows. top 10-15% people exposed virus.  


I doubt even need masks next summer. Nope live city worked restaurant yeah world I’m rich. see dead people. 😱 us.  Car sales “essential” work.  Generates much state revenue shut down. I've noticed, healthy person, sense smell weaker morning well. think might [be taking nasal spray I'd tell otolaryngologist doctor said ask do.  2 doses common, second often referred booster. 

And pool -80C freezers finite ( used research labs). someone pandemic -80C fail, trying replace unfortunately asap challenging.  Without sounding selfish don’t care people don’t get it, means go back sort normality see family without feeling like could putting risk doubt would mention ""less optimal"" doses all.

If guess, advantage full shot first initial immunity probably far better give half doses first. missing out. Publix gives full 10 spot. wish world half intelligent think we're calling anyone likes informed ""news junkies""?

It seems standards dropped low nobody expects americans able check sources analyze piece information whatsoever.

It really matter there's thousand trumps government long there's least one Fauci. would nice garbage disappeared overnight occur everyone human beings filter crap information listen ones know they're talking about. call freedom. A bird in the hand worth two bush. think taking what's safe available better waiting chance something slightly better comes later, possibly get covid. Imagine delusional. many people ""murdered"" police, buddy? think less 40 unarmed people killed police ""on regular"", bridge sell you. mention almost every instance 40 people killed resisting arrested posed threat police officers. That's murder, buddy boy.

I doubt I'll get sort real response though. You'lll probably press arrow think argument. 40% get shot directly correlated population morons. Hmmm. vaccine entirely composed ribonucleic acid, vital, naturally-occurring acid found cells helps us produce amino acids proteins. ""dangerous chemicals"" all. doses already ready UK

full doses, effective 1/2 dose full dose? start with

* Cease support colonial sympathizers Hong Kong international apology.
* Cease support literal ex-ISIS western China international apology.
* Get Murdoch de-program Australia back civilized world
* Allocate mandatory 33% US telecom infrastructure Huawei
* Immediately release political hostage Canada apology reparations
* Allows full international investigation Fort Detrik
* public in-persona apology Biden Great Hall People everything Trump done last 4 years.

I could added removing Chinese companies Entity List, working China's interest far via boosting sales Chinese suppliers, keep that. Shocked pikachu face Probably means larger picture. deterrent Chinese ambitions example. Well read title does. Oxford two different regimes, one 62%, one 90%. averaged 70% figure used most, Sky however choose go 90%. Strelka Belka, i'd guess :) orcas irony would sea world Welcome back March, 2020. Rushed? think started scratch like year ago? Mate they’ve probably working vaccine ever since first sars happened back It’s actually common shipping temp pharmaceuticals. usually use dry ice. One infected patient usually means mass tracking/testing , even lockdown whole city China. means hundreds millions $$$ spent. Slauoi Trump puppet. one, he's African immigrant Muslim, lambasted Trump several occasions.

Edit: also predicted vaccine November (which came true) so... gonna even earlier, mass vaccination one give fuck restrictions masks doesn´t matter virus widely spread already population, rare get infected packaged food compared community transmission.

Judging post history 31? risk needing hospitalization really low risk death even lower. Take break sub need keep mind news report cases somebody gets viral infection recovers uneventfully even though common outcome. Covid-19 serious public health threat, individual health perspective, likely fine. Please tell manager store. point. Point mostly living life before. Lockdown take forever, long enough bring numbers infected. 

Yes though, right, us government drop ball taking care needed it. People left fend lockdowns. pretty screwed up.

But takes lockdowns keep numbers low. people want another lockdown due rising cases acted responsibly fact. Keeping social distancing wearing masks, etc. way prevent lockdown.

We stuck viscous cycle could avoided. push poll. Good let’s Biden’s birthday party Gavin newsoms elegant 1000 dollar plate dinner instead shaming regular citizens.   - country COVID treats real - another country (US) quarter million dead still many say hoax. Unreal. might stick control group, case good luck! I’m sure people AZ really appreciate work y’all doing. see happening two weeks? People getting oxygen car there’s bed them? I'm aware people issues vaccines. best friend plans flu vaccine around luls work schedule usually sick like 3 days gets it. sucks, still huge deal grand scheme things. Instructions unclear...literally shit toilet, know now, figured bring shower me!  Yep seem ironic political party seems emphasize “personal responsibility” one irresponsible... live loft? mean worst comes worst bribe population get vaccine give 20$ make special excemption drug law get free dime bag meth vaccine shot.  I’ve heard people gasping last breaths saying “COVID isn’t real, it’s hoax!” I’m going surprised boycott vaccine. Sputnik makes four 90% number isn’t greatest. There’s lot uncertainty. one it’s really small subset patients it’s obviously enough patients statistical conclusion. really want 40k person trial low dose. would answer questions. Now, it’s hot mess. supposed get married last year moved August 2021. I’m pretty psyched looks like it’s going happen! Fox News told think. literally people places America, helping people religious ideal, right thing do. tried governor said implement things like dining ban mask rule. Ah, ol' ""take gap year"" platitude. *might* viable option some, clearer understanding future held earlier year. 

But even then, typical 18-20 gap year? Most, work. work retail entry level jobs. exactly great strategy reducing Covid risk. 

How accepting fact entire generation trying navigate incredibly difficult situation, best can, working ass dealing incredible stress? maybe try showing little fucking empathy situation?  Hey vote him. That's based assumption people willing vaccinated.

If vaccines get politicalized ways like mask, shitshow. race everyone loses. 100% stands reason get sucking dirty fingers touched door handle, get putting contaminated surface mouth. 

This annoys human beings. even medicine. 

They create entire worldwide narrative makes logical sense. stick months still. 

They spent last eight months telling us need wash hands water soap minimum 20 seconds. 

But you’re going tell there’s Covid piece raw sushi, can’t get Covid “because it’s food” rather finger?

The way could possibly make sense, food antiviral properties surface. doesn’t.

And can’t say stomach acids kill it’s food, that’s food can’t infect. Portions virus stay mouth never get stomach. like lick fingers swallow saliva. 

There major medical websites also go detail heat food 165° certain number minutes kill coronavirus. 

The messaging place. basic thinking dictates probably get food. 

And quite people describe initial infection symptoms gastrointestinal.  start nasal / head cold (they inhaled it). start pink eye (they rubbed eyes). Others get diarrhea. bet ingested it. told...the virus would disappear Nov. 4. then, beds left Oklahoma, they'll ship people Dallas Atlanta, etc. 

Yep, enough collapse healthcare lol. suddenly we're together... worries. people got parked hallways still $500,000 medical debt they're discharged. different astrazeneca vaccine? shower actually quite nice find even worrying .
A years ago (7) added different strain annual flu shot caused issues children.
My friends children ended hospital due reaction children shot. number children ended intensive care flu shot year.
My friend phoned hospital warn get son vaccinated talking earlier week.
I still going get get vaccinated flu shot still causes stress year. shall see enough infections efficacy rate assessed.

Did read article? already determined Sinovac nowhere near good competitors protecting people COVID. company reported generated lower levels protective antibodies bloodstream compared arising recovered coronavirus patients. comparison, Moderna Pfizer, separate experimental vaccines, reported antibody levels par higher produced recovered coronavirus patients. source licensing? press release 2018 says multi-year strategic collaboration combine like developing tech together past years Covid19 vaccine first large scale application. They’re reporting results testing both. Somebody better tell kartrashians say this? mean... age group, death rate Covid similar death rate Flu... quite simple multitude reasons. Requesting military support lot red tape mainly place military established deal foreign threats operating US soil challenge. National Guardsmen also hold different status since belong state (title 10 vs title 32). Either way there's lot coordination needs done order request certain triggers often need met request made. Yeah that's seriously good point. I'm sure. Certainly someone Europe going California would least one intra-domestic flight- Chicago LA, NYC Denver etc. really know domestic flights counted. mention Japanese tourists going Hawaii California, Chinese tourists going big cities everywhere.  

It's hard know. things much lower risk extended social gatherings. vaccinated worried catching random person passed public. study bungled. give high dose get 62% effectiveness. get low dose looks like 90%. problem high dose population comparatively really small trial. 

So you’re doctor dose would give? Low dose data small number patients. Dependable? Maybe, dependable 40k person study.

High dose without low dose 62%. Maybe give it’s significantly worse Moderna Pfizer ones.

The data muddled clear cut. whole thing bungled. Many analysts already predicting it’s going approved US. mean honestly doctor US 3 options one would give. AZ vaccine less effective gate it’s even clear dose use. think Oxford vaccine delivered via chimpanzee adenovirus. immune system probably recognizes well full first dose, renders second dose less effective. smaller first dose probably means second dose gets job immune system gets rid it.  far testing. better metric - per capita daily deaths - Europe far higher US. vaccines first distributed front line medical workers high risk groups. give us even safety data. don’t make decisions current data. already used UAE well. lot people government rich people already gotten it, including one Putin's daughters.

If believe Putin lies told MH17 Salisbury. There's rational reason take word credible evidence. conspiracy. least see 40% populations massive amount, is, given need 65-75% vaccination achieve effective herd immunity. I'm likely close front queue UK mRNA vaccine, risk healthcare worker. I'll take offered, hesitation. case certain people offered limited order Pfizer vaccine rest Oxford? I'll gladly take either sure overall game plan know ""White Superiority Complex"" maybe. think people generally anti-vaccine think. It’s related vaccine. live hour away area great vaccine compliance, hour away area one worst vaccination rates province. Look still get measles outbreaks, pertussis outbreaks, mumps outbreaks....if people still won’t vaccinate diseases severe consequences readily available vaccines aren’t going run get one either. 

I know several people life already said won’t get vaccine - specifically anti-vaccine think tracking device it’s point sort. won’t claim anti-vaccine don’t feel “necessary” feel risk *them* severe illness low amount evidence convince part herd immunity. considering people also refuse vaccinate flu awfully easy vaccine get flu runs every year, don’t doubt continue refuse.

I still get it, also someone gets flu shot every year - year year probably 23-24 years - even knowing efficacy highly variable, keeps date vaccinations. ready line get H1N1 first available city. realized amongst talking others atypical amongst peers. I'm bit suspicious effectivity rates tbh. (The Netherlands) news first Pfizer-BioNTech 90%, af days later Moderna came 94,5% bit later Pfizer-BioNTech 95%. Could advancements, could bullshit.  want vaccine im genuinely concerned side effects.

You every right concerned, side effects concerns you?

None vaccine candidates reported severe adverse reaction; worst, seems might get hangover.

Are concerned could long-term effects years decades later? that's literally impossible, vaccine shown long-term side effects immediately apparent (the whole point give body shock, leave better prepared) risk far, far less risks Covid based know far. No, far likely explanation need (for instance) 1000 cases get validation. needed test dosages, 500 one dose 500 another. disclosing results 1000 cases enough get validated. care media runs says 'omg UK sucks, 60% effective', fully transparent results. 

In case, 'initial immunity' something pulled ass. probably perfectly safe likely efficacious.  skip double blind placebo trial rolled large numbers people. Presumably monitoring health side effects covid status.  But, without placebo group compare to, possible say 70,85 99% effective.  But, vaccine quite similar AstraZeneca vaccine probably nothing scary. 


Obviously choice one pick.. But, probably fine Scientology cares health safety rubes

Let's get carried away. may care Dr. Fauci gets lot face-time media. However, actions speak louder words. Currently, U.S. National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program cover Covid-19 vaccine. Furthermore, appears remain case even FDA approvals. Would love see Dr. Fauci address liability issue. It’s stuff Congress takes breaks. high level govt works country unfortunately scientist, know people also legitimate cause concern new, fast-track vaccines. Instead berating them, could work understanding fears coming trying educate transparent (not talking conspiracy theorists, talking normal people sub presumably stay educated learn COVID).  seems like real iron curtain comes vaccines, impossible find reliable analysis Chinese Russian efforts. 100% guaranteed.

And then, beds left Oklahoma, they'll ship people Dallas Atlanta, etc. 

Because God forbid anyone ""freedom"" loving people ought bear responsibility actions. Well that’s fucked. Come dark side work amazon, get paid get covid also Fire tablet last week sorting packages fastest lmao


(It would actually decent job got health insurance, don’t give part time employees besides managers facility part time employees 🙄) British one probably effective they're letting on, know self-deprecating Brits are. D3 best, think, easy get counter Right? stupidity people actively harms rest us. inherent media bias eating delicious confectionary delight breakfast precisely I've stopped watching MSM get news Alex Jones. understand grief fatigue.. 3 yrs ago lost 4 members family months. cat. end year exhausted. Everyone older, (except cousin 50s - brain cancer). miss all. miss stories phone calls. wear down. 

I think that’s good plan: stay healthy, safe, wait get vaccine. Kinda. body transforms ingested vitamin useful vitamin days. need take regularly. Sure - hopefully everyone access vaccine March hospitalisations people wilfully take one. mean urgency panic around virus largely disappear vulnerable groups vaccinated, mortality specifically remains low even anti-vaxx young.  Bill Gates said yesterday, optimistic frontrunners end efficacious. able see immediate family holidays take care covid patients don’t want spread anything them. can’t people stay home? 'murica! people El Paso actually something it? mask wearing, distancing, etc? still ignoring even this? Good point--Important tested after, high level Vit good lead Heart palpitations, want disturb heart's electrical balance Even flying safe, still moves virus around  Keep mind, mRNA vaccines development much longer COVID specific ones; first approved one. 

Also understanding mRNA works new all. fragile breaks inside bodies time.

I thought ""layman"" explanation happens pretty interesting: [Vaccine Possibilities : COVID19 That’s pretty common, unfortunately. things started getting bad months ago, several people area family members sick COVID daily social media posts person declined asking people share people could see bad really is. Pretty much driven delete social media constant harassment liars, family must sick already, attention since virus isn’t real, etc. I’ve really lost rest hope humanity year. ""I control close contact with."" Lucky you, must work public take public transport. Many us can't control that. mixed ice crash victims. North Dakotan taking seriously scared. like girlffriend tell parents visit us august... Fortunally, virus wide spread back none us got infected redo mistake thankgsgiving till got vaccin. Tell calling stupid now. that's case, suggest may difficult offer booster shots immunity coronavirus protein fades immunity chimp adenovirus. let's cross bridge come it. much drop could attributed lack overseas visitors? know proportion domestic flights booked residents opposed visitors Oklahoma. Seriously, care. people flatly refused even acknowledge virus real. 

Y'all chose bullshit, cruelty-first version ""freedom."" consequences. Tough shit. Putin supposedly already get it? work hospital well. hospital provides 80 hours leave contract Covid work. got husband, able use extended sick leave using three days PTO.

Sounds like need better hospital. must boycott Big Charmin know breakdown, going produced quite widely. Aside UK, presumably supply European market via finishing packaging facility Catalent Italy. production SK Bioscience South Korea, Siam Bioscience Thailand, Fiocruz Brazil, CSL Australia, company US can't find moment. may missed some. Yep, statistically significant difference 62% group. hand 90% figure disputed due small sample size - see remember plenty people get legitimate happiness going bars movie theaters ok you. Good worth adding also reported \*very tentative\* findings low-dose-normal-dose regimen might even protect asymptomatic infection, true would huge controlling covid! Shut Hate say people infected today, some, already dead. way cases exploding, position. know anything could do. feel guilty. know stress can't even put words, know appreciated people really trying damnedest eradicate virus staying fuck away people. Dumb asses Another person thread said Buck ""uber conservative"".  googling. hints definitely Buck conservative.  OTOH, Eric purposely answering political questions every reference see knows him. That's great number!! Mine 9 without supplementing. Stupidity spreads faster virus. See: social media. stats presented show regimens better placebo. see stats indicating regimen 2 better regimen 1. anyway, stats proof, describe degree uncertainty something. I’ve following search trends since March. It’s predicted states cities spikes weeks 100% accuracy.

Yes. 4-6 weeks. that’s start. Tack weeks level 2 level 3 spread numbers really go up. virus moves slow motion explodes.

For real life case study, Sturgis bike Talley happened August. Look happened Dakotas Minnesota... studies recently. took quite bit time quietly spread. are, 3 months event things continue grow it.

Plus, take account spread everyone traveling back. People get week, starts spreading weekend next week symptoms get back airports, drive hotels, name it.

This create entirely new wave top one ultimately take 3 months play out.

Then add Christmas... New Years... it’s like 3X perfect storm nationwide spreading events. Study account population variables, additional measures like restaurant closures, pre mask mandate viral spread. 

There’s many confounding variables r/covid19 basically said it’s useless.  Everyone saying hospitals full month. It’s turning chicken little.  I’ll hit soon lockdown done. decent bike ride eat park. That’s kind you. I’m RN. you’re saying wanting twist ankle exactly I’m referring to. keep telling parents please slip ice.

I’m getting alarmed rate spread. It’s happening fast. sounds melodramatic say it’s disaster, but...it’s pretty much disaster point. Considering fairly close vaccine, you’d hope people would hunker last push. 

My APRN. verify every Covid test result computer. days, whole lot tests. must electronically verify negative positive results, follow patients give instructions. Yesterday, thought they’d changed computer system longer required clicking ‘verify’ box negatives. However, realized simply negatives. 

We keep hearing exact thing. ‘I didn’t think serious. thought flu.’ Good saving cash. wife Saved money 2020 far year that’s even considering 401(k) pension savings. never spent penny $3400 got stimulus back April, went straight savings. 

I think point it’s healthy enjoy hard work saving actually spending money it’s time whatever like do. sure you’re talking about. would become zombie? Probably halfway point there. Id expect India could vaccinate high proportion 1.3B persons Exactly... This. sure downvoted. true statement. think 3,000 people? large rest study, large enough probably expect results borne wider-scale study... fuck talking about? anti-mask dance party mall Quebec weekend. massive parties Halloween Dawali Canada. regular anti-mask protests major cities. saw like 100 people partying patio downtown Toronto 2 weeks ago masks seen.

Sure grocery store vast majority people wear masks, tons reckless anti-mask behaviour country. lot people everywhere give shit. Nope, clarified statement said left event creater. Plus seeing public putting got mild case (symptoms resolved within 36H) spring first wave. GI notable. Super low fever glued toilet night. NZ would fucked full Americans. headlines always framed oddly. Travel always going peak holidays compared mid-year, luckily still lot (over half) overall compared November 2019. you’re fortunate live state covid restrictions (mask mandate, etc) I’d call local/county health department anonymously file complaint employer workers flaunting rules. come inspect well.

You right safe work environment. Everybody (literally) doctor dying stays home. essential worker bullshit

My point that's mindless solution. Nurses, EMTs, police, firefighters stay home? Grocery stores pharmacies shut 30 days? Good luck ""plan"". 

Even forced stay indoors gunpoint, plan would still ruined entitled, paranoid fools. Grocery stores, example, carefully follow provincial pandemic guidelines fairly safe risk-free. biggest risk add uneducated simpletons equation. We're already seeing that. number people said would take vaccine much lower summer.  reminder everyone hating rural people...we’re one person. 

We’re struggling Covidiots like y’all, way less support...and get lumped them. 

Kinda like lumping people together according country birth, skin color..

Just living somewhere political statement it’s live. *Ridiculou$*

FTFY.. miss way, count them. Let's go Oxford! see develop superiority complex stating get less thought could. People drive time. eat meat industrial factories harm animals. phones made raw minerals unethical labor used damage land Arica. Yet, continue sacrifice. comes this, make stand this? hypocrisy unfathomable. want go travel. cancel trip Cancun backpacking Asia due this. I'm tired. Ohhh, thanks. I'm high dose due deficiency. Time add magnesium.  taking multivitamin 1,000 IU vitamin second Vitamin supplement 2,000 IU vitamin levels checked unrelated reason last month. still came back low vitamin levels. Dr. told double daily vitamin supplement dose. taking 5,000 IU daily negative impact. Sex workers mostly women gay people aren’t allowed criticize groups. Many still religious exemption, proof needed “Hard convince”?

Why convinced otherwise? would make sense continue many restrictions vaccine healthcare system isn’t overwhelmed. Screwing little man too. Thank do.

Sorry deal this. dont need herd immunity much need limit damage flu season levels. get there, game becomes lot easier. need eradicate virus win, need save lives.

Everything else gravy lol 60% people said back normal, figure changed since summer. usual lockdown skeptics creating reality getting info. Great info way would like see daily basis.  point is...? makes twice deadly flu, though apparently masks lockdowns year, useless coronavirus, pretty effective flu... lol. took adjustment, I'm fucking loving this. commute, saving ton money, flexibility long get stuff done.

For key building dedicated spot work. Someplace wife stepping other, decent chair, decent keyboard good lighting zoom meetings.

I'm praying keep going schools (safely) reopen. Going office regularity really nothing me. It'll hard us replicate success given stubborn many people America. Grandma Christmas going gift family year many science deniers.

It would trivial use propaganda year. Also, vaccines. madness. make sense then. helpful? telling us? surfaces pose serious risk wiping packages down? contrary principle findings? take two vaccines? Like take one ALSO ones? Ultimately, argument boiling this: ""be good little sheep, told, fuck freedom, stick needle arm""

You winning hearts minds type rhetoric, buddy. needle staying arm 2025, least vaccine come couple months, natural immunity may already slowed infection point going away minimal restrictions. Vaccines speed restoring normalcy, opening business, removing social distancing masks. I'm point way vaccine administered shot eyeballs, I'd still get it. Shoot eyes, it. care. deaths? countries similar delays, many probably report today/last 24 hours regardless occurred. info low dosage melatonin? I've taking 1 mg nightly. suppose taking cruise die month two, never get chance go 50 year old proven safe drug know kills covid (rlf-100). Proven safe adults children, 6 months usage negative side “Getting everybody 6 weeks food” monumental task would require 6 months supply chain preparation. mention average consumer doesn’t storage capacity big delivery. forget also human race created vaccines order magnitude faster vaccine ever created before. successful societies East Asia New Zealand virtually eliminated disease. risk getting sick? Live parents doctor mother saw Friday started exhibiting symptoms today. wearing masks close (from behind, analyzing back problems). We’ve quarantined since March ofc we’ll continue time we’re scared death. ones French Laundry fine! many doses US ordered? shit?! Oh, excellent, right peak cases!  Mitch McConnell still trying figure take everything dies. hit really hard year, chances able afford much next year.

This completely anecdotal, personally bunch tickets already concerts postponed 2021. request refunds since knew I'd still want see shows refunds done much anyhow. hope sake fans bands work same. 70 new 95% Belgian officials sure sounded like plan yeah think anyone else banking pretty solid me. exactly? Names, organizations, code word understanding?

With types, probably code ""the jews"" wonder ""rugged individualistic"" people (if survive) afflicted coronavirus different tune socialized healthcare receive medical bills mail... Water also found wet.

Q declares water secretly fire  OP’s article suggests masks effective 1918, read it. Gauze not. get vaccinated  Vietnam 



Nothing else needs saying. way please heads up, Target started Drive-Up pickup areas long use app. Check local one see participates. used drive 30 mins one way get drive-up groceries, recent change lifesaver. Problem excess body fat Vitamin gets sequestered fat. fat have, gets sequestered. Meaning, would take get circulating levels up. Best start blood test find level start making adjustments there. bigger, needed 10,000 IUs/day get satisfactory levels.

Also, standard ranges insufficient Covid. doctor would tell anything 30 ng/mL normal, want hit 40+ extra protection Covid. That's level data shows statistically significant mortality protection. asked study ""how remains safe,"" inherent risks  everyone overweight thyroid issue condition I'm tired hearing this.

No, people self control. lockdowns China outside wuhan Rlf-100 proven kill covid inhibit Congrats, shows insanely petty are. global push snuff thing regardless efforts take credit never involved Trump way shape form. No, doesn't. legitimate doctor tell wearing mask dangerous. Apparently clue gauze is. picture get clue. See holes? LMAO  Serum said half doses go India. half rest world. produce 1 Billion doses end 2021 alone.

However, Serum manufacturer. India's main manufacturer. AstraZeneca still facilities. Good brother.. take care Happy Thanksgiving.. must misread. subreddit allow political discussions. suppose read somewhere “encourages political discussion believe right”  suck England!

USA! USA! (and Germany) words, 90% figure efficiency half dose + full dose regimen based 3 positive cases vaccine meaning reliable taken caution, may optimistic looks data, given real explanation lower dose may far effective. think chose go 70% overall average figure rather 90% sub-group one

I basically agree could look way: half-dose group 2,741 given full dose twice, they'd expected nine cases instead three have. sample size, likelihood would get third expected cases vaccine (and 1/9th cases control group) chance? fucked read earlier article said max last year 2.5 million people flying per day last years thanksgiving. current 1 million/day 40% that, i’m assuming number bit higher week. Nobody saying you’re right wrong. aren’t allowed discuss politics here, divisive far many people make broad comments hopes dividing sparking argument(like you) medical alert bracelet like use severe allergies would work nicely. Patients ""Covid-19 hoax!"" bracelet would receive default Army treatment: take bunch ibuprofen, drink water, get sleep... Unless hospital plenty capacity. I'd fine treating them. I'm total monster. Ouch. patient taking Vitamin K2? K2 help mitigate calcification, general, helpful higher doses Vitamin since increases calcium absorption. K2 helps shuttle excess calcium bone rather soft tissue. Makes even funnier.  Someone believes vaccines chips always believed something cause reject vaccine form. wish would project archive sub articles pandemic, scientific studies people reactions demos, gold mine scientists looking back pandemic 10 years know virus, good starting guide tackle future ones. show way effective “half dose” followed “full dose,” lied knows “standard dose” defined. suggests parametric study, probably animals shown similar response humans, might show combination better, like 3/4 dose followed full dose. inverse dose-response effect surprising, random variation ruled out. authorities said beginning would accept 50% effectiveness. Time deploy Jon Stewart. Covid-20 understand people believe risks. question risks were. sure much simpler need be...  Vitamin deficiency also tracks several anomalies we've seen virus. example, seems deadlier minority groups (those dark skin) US. groups also much likely Vitamin deficient. Melanin production (which makes skin darker) blocks UV slows Vitamin production. That's good thing live sunny climate (because prevents skin cancer), bad thing live Northern climates months relatively low sunlight levels. Swedes study years ago African immigrants found every single person deficient.

Vitamin fat-soluble, supplements great getting absorbed. best dietary source milk, good thing took kids schools (where drink milk every day) prevented getting Vitamin D.  question cannot definitively answered without experiment would unethical would never allowed. answer probably would prevent getting disease would reduce severity. shocking development shit! Agree 100% almost feel sorry second magnesium supplementation. morning routine take Pellegrino dump magnesium citrate powder, salt lo-salt (potassium chloride) Vitamin C powder. like Airborne without sugar. Feels like carbonation helps salts dissolve easily tastes better going good post-sleep electrolytes. main question people unwilling (so read article). FTA:

1. Many worry ""that timeline rushed, 26% Republicans reporting reasoning refusal.""
2. 20% Republicans anti-vax start (as 2% Democrats 14% Independents).
3. 61% men report willing get it, compared 54% women.
4. getting it... 37% Americans claim due rushed timeline, 26% want confirm vaccine safe. 12% trust vaccines general 10% would like study efficacy taking themselves. 15% cite miscellaneous reasoning (generally either saying issue ""politicized"" simply necessary)

I, one, first line. I'm considering wearing something (like various colored ribbons people wear different causes) indicate vaccinated maybe reassure worried vaccine safe. people prevent us sensible health care system...are predominantly rural voters. stress rant anything else. husband COVID getting symptoms. Mt main concern right going follow guidance seeing people 14 days, ex insisting negative tests son comes back. (Luckily, mom's husband got it, due come back day symptoms started, he's mom's house since). Everything I've read cautions taking tests get negative due testing availability positives showing months infections. lawyer thinks better comply now, judge want tell okay stick parenting plan, case something happen came back them. we're trying math finding best times test hopefully virus gone get see boys soon possible I'm starting cases people positive results months despite doctors really thinking they're contagious anymore. 17 deaths yesterday. Consistent lower trajectory. Wonder many outdoor dining. 

But follow science.  confirm case hospital staff Canada too.

If get covid, sick - better use sick time... any? 
Stay home unpaid work 2 weeks later

Just sad profit!? Sounds like SoCiALiSm

Why diseases? think people say they're going wait kind people first couple stages distribution anyway oh, easy say right wait 5 years 50 million seniors get vaccinated sudden death rate goes 200 day people probably change mind, course death rates I'll stay something like would completely justified previous thought process vaccine that’s quick cheap make easy store transport great result. NCC Spokesperson Tom Super previously told Ohio Valley ReSource August evidence increased line speeds evisceration lines susceptible COVID-19 transmission. statement Thursday Super said group reviewing study, confident still link COVID-19 transmission line speed waivers evisceration lines automated. 

Well I, one, glad see they're keeping open mind using science-based approach inform industry-group's policies.

Only idiot would state conclusion even read paper. FOX News primetime lineup lives ""anarchist jurisdiction"" NYC. *fills sensory deprivation chamber vitamin d* internet warrior. Lol I'd taken Moderna vaccine yesterday could, news, seems Oxford vaccine offers almost efficacy (90% administered properly), way less risk. risk averse person, it'd foolish accept risk return. Plus Oxford trial seems conducted better (testing asymptomatic people regularly) cheaper. hope take one tbh, though I'd still take ones they're going accessible months earlier (more return justify risk). They'll spread older relatives also likely survive, die they'll leave houses bar patrons. long-term they'll probably stick one right since they've got millions upon millions doses pipeline would make sense give someone 90% effective vaccine even 95% effective one come next year Christmas: “Hold beer.” really. problem none vaccine studies identifying vaccine's ability prevent colonization transmission. presence antibodies good sign, indication ability prevent symptoms let alone prevent colonization transmission. again, rural parts country refuse move forward accept reality instead depend largess cities reality smacks face regardless.  source approving 12/10? indications grant EUA 12/10 (barring something completely left field) vaccine deployed hours later. worry, everyone! Gavin still able eat fancy restaurants medical officials mask rules apply him! majority cases last week two, people time die yet. death rate can't compared state previous high peak cases already resolved. mention treatment improved state experiencing early peak (New York) much higher death rate. Refrigeration? Time sensitive? know often logistics late, missing, messed up, damaged? proof. fiasco tests back March. show up, less said had. Also remember ENTIRE batch contaminated? Also remember administration seized PPE back too? Doctors wear garbage bags. gonna happen again. 

Also remember IMHE model said Covid would disappear US June? said would exponential decline cases?

Saying millions vaccinated like magic naive. know administration is? inept US government literally everything? projects ever get done time? No. things delayed missing time? Yes.

Well considering poorly US done. think experts dropped ball. They're superhumans. They're flawed anyone else. given stupid average American is. Dealing stupidity politics. Look useless CDC been. done single damn thing.

Will happen eventually? Yes. happen December January? No.

I guarantee even Feburary news reports ""Doctors X Hospital seen single dose vaccine yet."" another one ""1 million vaccines found contaminated unusable""

I'm realist. Literally bar ground. America fucked. People trying talk Thanksgiving/ illness really COVID.

Negative test - especially unknown exposure - meaningless days advance. definitely gives impression protest occurring Toronto. small protests Canada, imagine begin shrinking attendance coming weeks chaos south border becomes evident. 

Also, ""City Toronto"" well Peel Region lockdown, since Greater Toronto Area intertwined see useful broadened surrounding areas. 

In particular, York Region remain open end funnelling lot social activity caseload also forces lock down. However, protection 90% analysis around 3,000 people trial given half-sized first dose full-sized second dose.

Done yet? nervous Nellies

I've called this, ""negative Nancy"", ""paranoid"", ""need mental help"", ""uncompromising"", worse.

Think want, really care.

Once over, need able say absolutely everything could keep people love safe. would never forgive got family sick got careless. long we've defensive, distancing ourselves, washing hands, covering faces, limiting infection rate.

Now, go offensive. puny virus find humans easy meat fertile soil longer! Kids home it’s frowned upon leave dog crate Moms attend class clear article. 

Lol saying that, Pollard said 'it's clear difference'. use reddit's quoting system all.

Doesn't seem entirely clear cut although that's certainly Pollard Gilbert thinking. Hopefully full set trial data bears 90% current based 3 cases, less. Good news: Moderna vaccine trials Zika already.

Malaria’s trickier one wants touch Dengue potential ADE. He's talking ass. Ok, sure would focus one vector, even goal, three! Yellow fever MANY infections deaths zika--and vaccine exists, distribution/cost problem only. again, 0% chance malaria vaccine. Controlling Aedes mosquitos likely (and Malaria eliminated SE US) still big challenge. Bot, annoying.

That comment really hoped rest country would able learn watching went New York... no, guess thought bunch [ironic reference immorality][reference political party] people happened exceptionally pandemic-susceptible. 🙄

I guess we're allowed bitterly muse people think us sub... restrictions travel March? 

Genuine question, can't remember ever US. Isn’t worse? What’s percentage people don’t show symptoms? double stacking icu beds disgusting... actually recent picture. selfish people be? I'm going hope fake picture. 

Then again, work colleagues Germany barely wear masks work, despite rules (not department area; others watching). tell they're chill rules / worried. respond saying roommate cancer, chill it. Sorry guys, there's people need us take seriously! Capitalism certainly stuff supporter capitalism synonymous game theory. prisoner's dilemma also example capitalism? lol.   think you’re grateful now, wait state goes bankrupt covering flooding losses. private insurers left market years ago. One bad hurricane they’ll screaming federal aid bail dumbasses pretending climate change won’t impact decades. someone living Massachusetts....I fucked Meanwhile, jaw hit floor today...

HUGE spike people searching for: Covid test, Covid testing, Covid symptoms Google morning. Largest yet long shot. Top states, order:

New York, Hawaii, Oklahoma, Iowa, New Jersey, Nebraska, Louisiana, New Hampshire, Maine, Virginia, S. Dakota, Rhode Island, Vermont, S. Carolina, Texas...

Expect see huge numbers far positive tests within next 2-3 weeks grow there.

I’d willing bet farm week go history largest spreading event history travel Thanksgiving. take 4-6 weeks see beginning spike top spike.

This exponential growth looks like. beginning. frustrating watching happen real time - it’s easy track places become next hot spot weeks advance. lately it’s pretty much nationwide.

In past 4 hours, every state US except 4 leads google search: Covid testing

We going absolutely explode cases hospitalizations 4 weeks - top everything happening.

If worse case scenario outline needed draft back March, far would Nov need look like create ultimate nightmare year end, it.

I can’t believe still wide open. random dude access data see what’s happening real time track everything, can’t imagine data Gov has, yet choose stay open.

At point, see every warning sign would point immediate full stop lockdown. going beyond bad. Shit. ever time jump 21st century getting bidet, time. Hopefully try bring many ventilators possible convert available hospital space makeshift ICUs standup local, temporary emergency clinics non life-threatening emergencies. last long Lots lots younger people. 

However, hospitals overflow number going spike. think leaked UK paper. independent, think. link handy Oh ok, guess mathematicians rightists came buzz terms fucking game like open-source projects pretty much definitive proof issue.

Tragedy commons say everyone break rules cooperative gaming (ie open source projects, excessively using resources, etc.) cannot exist. get heads

It sounds like think numbers low? aren’t. something contagious atrociously high numbers. 

To put context flu/pneumonia (the biggest infectious disease killer US) death rate someone 50 1 2 100,000. low end range listed 1 300. always better less.

Uh absolutely case Vitamin D. much toxic level causes serious problems, common 400 IU supplement dose laughably low, people go 10,000 IU per day prolonged periods (months/years). take Democrat money?

It's inherently selfish ideology. Agreed, unfortunately WC law covers employees every industry state. Texas also lets employers opt WC coverage. basically, employee injured job employer opted WC coverage, employee sue damages. violates (in opinion) whole purpose WC. Unfortunately sounds like early speculation may true.

[Oxford/AZ Vaccine Efficacy Data | Pipeline I’ve seen people speculating morning numbers may better look, believe trials monitored patients PCR tests rather symptoms. case, yes, that’s finer net Pfizer Moderna trials used would certainly affect efficacy readouts. don’t think is: looking [**published trial cases defined “SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR-positive symptomatic illness”, patients show symptoms disease (see Table 13). don’t think explain lower efficacy saying finding asymptomatic people well: trial excludes asymptomatic people endpoint definition. rate asymptomatic cases treatments controls determined trials (see section 8.5.2.1 protocol) aren’t numbers we’re seeing today. Fun fact: Veterans set fire protest poor VA funding regular basis. Makes proud American, it? already CornaVac's preliminary P3 results too, way:

"" “The first results clinical study conducted Brazil prove **among vaccines tested country, CoronaVac safest, one best promising rates**,” São Paulo Gov. João Doria told reporters Brazil Monday. like anti-bodies needed means higher rates fever adverse reactions... guess also higher share prices. USA “me first” mentality work. Care never anyone else!

Such dumb county I’m ashamed citizen of. Sounds right-wing d3/k blend taken fatty food source good, magnesium low dose melatonin night. (Talking micrograms mgs)  need get tested again.  caveats this, including 0.5 dose followed one dose regimen yielding better results (90% efficacy) logical explanation (Ad. Vector immunity caused large first dose reducing potency second dose), yeah they’re less effective. Also certain parts trial swabbed participants weekly, skews numbers include asymptomatic infections, great news demonstrated solid level sterilizing immunity COVID vaccines (as alluded BioNTech CEO). Good news it’s still pandemic stopping vaccine.

Wild months ago 50% reduction hospitalizations criteria vaccine. enough options 70% average vaccine seems like half win. say it’ll still get lots usage, especially across younger populations west among lower-income countries. hospitalizations trial either! mean parasite class? They're capitalists, they're bloodsucking, disease spreading pests. grovelers egging malefactor-in-chief. reveling evil, destruction, chaos. like watching orcs. Roommate tested positive last Thursday two others live got tests immediately after. There’s large walk-in testing site far live. got tests within 30 minutes other. 1 negative still waiting final one. got mine 48 hours, 56. guys experience positive tests take longer report? Kind confused here. best news even got Covid19 vaccination got mild cases. tells vaccines even effective advertised priming bodies’ defenses. 30% chance getting case covid serious (no pneumonia, hospitalization, adverse impact vital organs) perfect book.  want vaccine, would lot fewer reservations one receive approved somewhere like Germany France. eyes, many decision makers within US government solidly demonstrated willingness sell population river political even modest financial gain. feel populations countries collectively involved politics hold leaders much higher standard US less effective much cheaper vaccine stored much easily. 

It makes sense use developing countries. UK people swabbed weekly. many different trial protocols makes really hard make sort apples apples anything release. America. stand for. soldiers became cannon fodder for. really. young rent car would four day drive hotels. ""gold standard US FDA""

That may thing once, I'm sure global trust FDA used be. Don’t tempt Garfield... Honestly. people die. can’t squeeze blood stone. simply staff beds folks die scene ER parking lot. Well principal. US needs stop world police. become policy need find countries could trading countries freely? Sorry hear one month long, gradual improvements, I'd assume continues improve, hopefully 100%. Second third opinions medications might wise help along. Always been, issue contagiousness Yes, always need rural. However, mean rural needed. lot isn't. can't pay infrastructure required sustain desirable quality life, enough demand services. time rethink business model, pack move.  

BTW, grew farm, still involved operations. easy business, sympathize, awful lot rurals living yeowman farmer fantasy. poisoned shrewd political operators selling rural paradise never be, fueling dangerous sense entitlement toxic counterproductive. That's actually current plan. extra stress it. I'm actively trying stressed want get better lol. 

Plus, trying figure best time test. I'm one week, 8 days first symptoms, (so get back timely manner seem taking longer right now) figure positive, I'll fork extra money another week 24 hour test. fair: March probably ambitious, May could easily see it. Here's latest case/death charts Navajo county, running 7-day 242.19 deaths per 100k population. really bad, although worst. They're ranked 89th per capita disappointing, sadly Pfizer's vaccine available country time being.  else looking double masks &amp; eyewear coming weeks?

Just stay home? punch BHT + SARS-COV research safe compound folks used since seventies. effective antiviral, need one dose take day become exposed. Cousin vitamin E, lab made almost common nature thought Indiana? /s

I cling blue island. also don’t like nine months perpetual swamp ass heat humidity. like seasons!

DeWine better DeSantis, though. they're referring triage. Health providers start make decisions think best outcome limited resources manpower available. dont make cut, well thanks playing. “Don’t tread me!”

(Cue emergency)

“***BIG GUBMINT HALP!!!***” Keywords ""patent rights"". university public institution privatize something profit, unlike pharmaceuticals who'll let millions die let go precious profits thru patent rights. Oxford's vaccine enters public domain recipe shared worldwide countries develop generic brand faster without international trade redtape involving IP. yeah. point happen flatten curve icu patients cause capacity start seeing spike deaths curve cause people could saved ICU death sentence. stats showed 1% steady cases/deaths ratio far. go up. 4 10 won’t get it. Hmmm, surprisingly similar level support certain loser received.  Correlation? So, basically discovered middle night history 100% made humans aliens quote meaning lessons life reset zero generation ? Ah yes, you’re right. Fixed furious abt normal spring article lolol  trump gets 270%? live ND, scary even leave house. Maskless Wonders everywhere. chatted someone SD weekend though. referred Noem rock star went beating Covid SD disgusted suggest otherwise. many people don’t understand even bring beds, lack qualified staff care patients. don’t want health care professionals caring me, aren’t trained critical care.

*I say RN 40 years, trained critical care.  months debating efficacy masks conservative friend, finally settled terms:

1. Prevailing evidence exists suggest masks slow community spread.
2. disagree studies indicate masks protect wearer, too
3. never wear one mandated government; however, would wear one private business required I’m glad someone else sane around here. community constantly screams anyone opposing lockdowns empathy, lack empathy compassion understand people take risk see family absolutely incredible. Yes, it’s end excerpt mod stickied sort shit cause insurance companies deny claim. Insurance pay somebody intentionally destroys property, assholes intentionally ignoring basic pandemic safety protocols. AP classes best part high school me. 

Stats terrible college, probability easily one top 3 toughest courses. Based data alone it’s tough see doctor would decide dose use kind confidence. use low dose high dose? Maybe low dose patient numbers low nobody really understands low dose better. Maybe high dose efficacy 70% maybe it’s really 62% subtract high dose people. many questions surrounding this.

I don’t see anywhere near first option developed countries. Pfizer/Moderna it’s simple straightforward. that’s want someone who’s doctor pharmacist nurse giving large large populations.

I don’t see AZ’s approval FDA easy may take long time possibility may approved all. It’s option it’s positioned developing countries fine tells need know choice 3 options choose. Double bonus Death Bill &amp; Ted movies (William Sadler) Blue Oyster Cult inspiration Stephen King's *The Stand*, book (and later mini-series) lab-created super flu escaped wiped 99.9% mankind.

I'm shocked.  one DTLA attached great hipster dive bar, go bar order slice pizza cocktail. healthy strong would better immune system. good immune system helps beat infections.

So according you, there's zero difference 90 year old cancer gets covid olympian getting covid?

How use logic spouting nonsense pretending know anything biology. Good point. live one highest per capita ZIP Codes Chicago (because largest diverse, chicago equivalent queens) likely allowed participate. tested positive 10/08 (last month), symptoms starting 10/04, dry cough, sore throat runny nose, really strong, cold. 

Now (last 3 days) I've symptoms (tiny bit stronger) although stayed large groups, can't keep safest condition work. 

Is possible covid-19 again? visit hospital test it, they'll probably ground two weeks, acceptable right me, new 3-months job (I started last month). Shoot, gotta start hitting gym then. get notifications CNN NYT don’t understand neither sent anything Damn bro. What’s like think neighbors much? issue whether people U.S. continue follow protocols like mask usage social distancing even vaccinated total active infections goes zero...I unfortunately much faith country right 😥 know patients moved? stupid? read headline? There’s u turn Sweden lol lowered amount people you’re allowed gather with. Still businesses closures, masks, etc

The great Harrington declaration signed thousands. Even people like Fauci think schools open. says lockdowns utilized much many countries are. think lot results coming caveats many participants either (A) knew vaccine altered results, (B) told go life normal, also altered results. Without peer-review dubious. Almost certainly half dose first regimen. Remember also, someone pointed Oxford routinely testing participants Rona whilst biontech pfizer testing symptomatic presentation. least somewhat account differences reported efficacy. That’s I’m seeing well. Regardless, 2700 participants dosage different 20,000. I’m sure statistically significant 90% figure I’ll leave data/statistician/immunologist nerds figure out. Transparency. people behind vaccine are, basically, scholars follow strict rules disclosing communication. bet people would wear bracelet badge honor. could actually sell those. big news everyone waiting Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine....one dose instead two, need extreme refrigeration.

Efficacy rate need know. Supposed announced end year. Every anti-vaxxer know rich, white, progressive mommy much time hands watches mommy vloggers day sips wine doses Xanax. 

Probably group people you’re referring to. Who’s surprised? me. People still denying virus dangerous, therefore taking precautions. sure take people open eyes. Oh stfu daft prick. agree that. I’ve seen interesting “outdoor” dining setups NYC definitely terrible airflow.

But idk LA would setups, given climate. doesn’t change always rural population needed grow food cities. attitude thread heartless towards human beings.

Maybe y’all don’t know care, don’t like idea friends dying families farmers. They’re ones going bars restaurants every night like liberal friends city are. first, I’ll watch flu vaccine actually Spanish flu; influenza mutates quickly immunity one strain isn’t helpful another, every year target vaccine strain that’s expected prevalent year. it’s generally using inactivated viruses, it’s really dose flu all, familiarizing immune system looks like.

The first influenza vaccines weren’t developed well 1918 pandemic, it’s quite recently 1918 strain virus recovered all. People haven’t vaccinated one particular, although vaccines H1N1 strains expected provide protection.  I'll wait real life trials get jabbed. fastest safe vaccine aware mumps vaccine took 4 years develop. aware plug play vaccines exist, release unease. ""places hospital send patients place has"".

What really expected done here?  again, sealion knows, maybe, like could easily get hospital check right Safety first right now. unfortunately given younger people shit times myself. But, growing up, everyone mostly drunk working. lot. I've told stay us save house and/or use tools. somebody makes long series terrible decisions, sometimes call out. offer help many times though. order Amazon don’t want go out. seems form tight seal. probably thinks city worst roads weather doesn’t make sense :) I'm tired. care. going out. know risk harms cause others. that's sacrifice I'm willing make. attitude, right there!!, what's gonna fuck country even further, overburden little Healthcare is, Americans give shit anything, really shows, RV tp different? like shitty 1/2-ply stuff businesses? Don’t get attached first interim top line, that’s almost guaranteed go data comes actually reviewed publishing. 70% excellent, vaccine treated way gives confidence mRNA vaccines. Anyone find safety data one? remember correctly, Ph2 Ph1(don't remember) vaccine rather unpleasant side effects point required people take Tylenol day day injection. awful, Tylenol thing stuck me.  need pull bootstraps build hospitals, grow doctors.

The cities pay selfishness cruelty rural reds. We're linking people's blog posts now? chin straps covering nose.

I gym today noticed, alone. one, trainer, inside.

As alone, pulled mask someone else would come in. resting series, walked mirror saw stupid look mask nose. pulled immediately. wonder much overlap “don’t tread me” anti-vaxers “businesses free whatever want” crowd.

“Leopards face” territory. Well good thing doctor making kinds decisions eyeball injection? wont going back normal 2019, 2020 shown little get with. bars, movie theaters, going eat time, spending money needless stuff. 2020 wake call. see says. update color coding.... America sick long Covid. Also, can’t use adult tubes, needles, equipment pediatrics vice versa. I'm sick hearing ""you elected them, deal bullshit"". voted guy Except works you’re assuming infinite uniform population zero variables. see, cases climb, mitigation efforts lower spread, etc etc. Nice. I'm glad y'all found like 7 months everyone else did. Midwest southeast fucked right now. trailer scenario. already serious Covid anxiety would recommend watching. yes regular people, lot 10,000. moderna's trial, example, 30k. think people averse wearing mask getting something injected them?  data seems good vaccines. I'd get.it soon could, even made nausea diarrhea week. Sorry realize that's bit graphic. Yes. whole point wearing mask prevent spreading respiratory droplets I’m talking or, worse, sneezing.

Yes it’s disgusting uncomfortable, we’re pandemic make sacrifices protect other. Yes, 8 months later still idiots believe masks someone US chronic illness affects ability work—it *is* terrifying. US system really, *really* hates disabled people. two political parties, one obsessed idea able work moral failing everyone forced pull bootstraps (boots included). many people favor social assistance plans please donors clever means testing programs bargain away human rights off-chance first political party speak favorably (and vote anyways). 

Basically, prepared world pain full time job advocating programs qualify *on paper* nobody wants actually grant access to. 

At time, sounds like come pretty rocky home situation already used lack social services, hopefully pleasantly surprised! know things difficult, 1) designed way (so don’t blame yourself), 2) ALONE. Maliciously spreading particles intentional act, whereas gross negligence willful ignorance fall “negligence” umbrella- here, folks know pandemic cdc many states advised spread virus wearing masks social distancing.

These folks willfully ignored caution demonstrated callous disregard safety health others picture also subsequent spread rest state country.

They duty grossly negligent don’t give fuck.

This literally causing harm.

Their “freedom party” thus include right spread infections harm others easily foreseeable cause infections possibly deaths. mere negligence standard gross negligence. guess dropped figured putting GB ""landlocked"" category would clear enough Technically there's coronaviruses discovered time ""know"" it. plausible, we'd found deficiency seemed correlate severity outcome. indeed like 10th study confirmed months now, since April. simple. can't force take vaccine, can't infringe rights freedoms. reasonable take precautions, restrict way live life. That's fundamental free society. ""Don't Tread Me"" words flag. one long funeral procession state 

Trump train ready go. Please dont scared death. Even test positive extremely, extremely likely make ok.  EDITED TITLE 

CLICK BAIT 

SCARE MONGERING

Honestly, OP?! title actually, “Could Covid-19 Vaccines Become Mandatory US?” reasons not, lol. It’s Johns Hopkins’ education website. academic discussion. argument ""I know people getting abortions they're sex, babies still born"". harm done. Normal different everyone know people jump bridge oft realize? Every decision ever made fixable .... except one. Ok looks like [they requiring masks people 6 feet Still dumb move book. Nothing ever normal. sense normal always changing. Friday saw 60% drop Friday last year Yes, unfortunately. Even local municipalities seem working sanely (intermittent lockdown avoid economical burden), whenever president opens mouth smallest hopes die. still thanksgiving travel spread contend even hit bed capacity, staffing stretched even scenario mortality rates explode. certainly hope this, think late. I'm MN we've accepting people Dakotas WI...they've overwhelmed us, population exploding. worried.

Hilariously, looking risk assessment terms covid state populated cities lowest infection rates. probably true everywhere. Hmmmmm. think referring voluntary research participants, right? know 10,000 lot that's still are, right? Yes deniers getting sick rural areas totally affect might everything right. /s

Maybe let's generalize much.

Sincerely, someone whose immunosuppressed mother across country getting prepped put vent EVERYTHING possibly right since beginning, still got sick. father, also sick time, take hospital city hour away home? Yes, nobody monopoly hospital use, condition, want risk hospitals near home terrible track record.

Nobody monopoly inner city hospitals. Deniers monopoly rural suburban areas either. Generalizing helps nobody.

/rant Yeah I’m you. People parts world barely virus surging. vaccines, always touted beginning end, start coming people stop dying/being hospitalized much, thus reducing strain healthcare system, really hard convince anyone keep up. 

Personally, vaccine made available (healthy 20-something) assume people already gotten offered won’t see reason continue like this. Abbott POS.  anyone recommend good Air Purifier filters covid? Hepa good choice? live 90 year old grandma deemed “essential” worker still go work daily. Thanks! True. Welcome sub, moderated college students rather medical professionals understand ethics public disclosure. wow, something , seriously wrong USA... words anymore... really gonna look good 2-3 weeks, horrifying!! think probably going make lot people even careless. may end relatively quickly due vaccines never saw Hollywood movie-level worldwide destruction, people going think never real threat first place could've ignored it. there's ever another similar pandemic, there's going huge portion population immediately oppose kind attempt mitigate they'll point coronavirus example things actually big deal. Must live non coastal state. Every city California started see “mask required” signs shop windows businesses big companies started take seriously. don’t know herpes, unfortunately good reasons haven’t developed vaccine HIV:

1. Extremely fast mutation rate

2. Lack ability immune system fight virus even antibodies right strain HIV.

I doubt mRNA platform would solve issues.

But think potential mRNA medical tool could eventually go way beyond vaccines. gives us ability get cells make protein, whether naturally made humans, made another organism, invented lab. Given much biology dependent protein structure potential enormous. almost like need profit motive medicine. almost like properly funded lab scientists produce good results. Yeah, get it; they'll painful weeks well projected cases still set rise. 10k pages lot info go EUA committee, even though firms getting data FDA process played out. 

I'm cautiously hopefully given many vaccines shown positive efficacy fingers crossed big gotchas data cause problems approval. TP starting get wiped shelves again, least Florida. No, downvoted thousandth fucking person make joke. **None us** thought French Laundry visit acceptable. Like literally nobody. stop it. Still hesitant due '78 swine flu vaccine. get eventually, first wave recipients 1 every 10 people confirmed covid... remember hillbillies ones justifying wearing masks cuz “what’s good city isn’t country”. OK fools, stop filling hospitals ombudsman one? one to-do list today. Thank you! Almost dying changes nothing

-House Shhhh science sub Yeah I'm guessing probably related. bought p100 respirator mask. US think saw would take till early summer everyone get vaccinated, 3 vaccines instead 1, would happen faster now? previous estimation news one stored super low temperature China deals COVID use language like 'total war virus' things like mass testing entire cities millions, full quarantines, lock downs, shut downs mass surveillance contact trace COVID positives. Everyone complies, everyone wears masks use contact tracing app. Within weeks life goes back normal. 

When US deals COVID, health professionals governors dress halloween costumes telling everyone TV practice safe trick treating halloween. Thanksgiving. even comply. POTUS gets COVID says ""meh big deal, felt great next day.""

Then wonder China COVID cases low tens everyday US hundreds thousands instead. job. editor's job give shocking news optimistic news, give news. News meant clickbait meant informative. 70% secure number. Well expect? started trials set specific end point # infections groups, like unblinded every day see number made look best. huge trial run ethically (without challenge) yielded positive results. thing longer trial show immunity wanes (which already studying). Technically % change based positives, really reason expect double blind trial would yield sort bias toward high efficacy early trial declining one time goes on. would find evidence behavior vaccinated individuals less risky placebo group.  Oh, use B? Oopsie-doo! science truth, optimism. cops get strong unions far real life
  ones scream magic medicine Joe Biden going ruin USA. gasping breath 100% Vapotherm. tell must another reason sick. call names ask wear “stuff” don’t COVID it’s real.’ People scared new vaccine developed quickly. truth mRNA vaccines, new, understood while. hard create mRNA vaccine break immediately. 

But advantage sort vaccine fast develop cheap manufacture. challenge around getting vaccine stayed active enough actually work. Safety really concern. Rural health management struggle even pandemic, someone grow food cities. One solution create satellite facilities major hospitals rural areas physicians rotate. might able see specialist day, specialist going next month scheduled. Another solution set buses transport patients main hospitals back. think health insurance companies deciding factor. insurance premiums discount employer requiring employees vaccinated, think employers jump that. Indian runner ducks can’t fly wings small  confirmation bias keeps taking precautions. go party twice get COVID, confirms keep that. month vaccinations shows improvements, jump right train, even though complaining long term effects could years away.

It's hilarious see confirmation bias turn favor.  Still waiting actual data back claim, source article sent: nothing back claims, like you. Edward Snowden NSA would disagree. Man! called it! ain't shit!  mean people world Yes, are. I've witnessed first second hand. Again, comments show ignorant this. DRUGS ALCOHOL DIE. SPREAD VIRUS KILL OTHERS.

I’m sorry, I’m 21 years old, healthy, don’t medical conditions, risk factors, don’t quite see need. 

The current vaccines shown potentially cause flu like symptoms. There’s also telling long term impact could be. 

The long term risk vaccine doesn’t seem lower without. anything it’s slightly higher, there’s slight chance I’d never catch Covid-19. initial surge, stopped elective surgery, continued pay employees even wasn’t work do. doctors nurses scrub techs redeployed throughout hospital extra help needed.

Also, dogs generally rewarded generous bonus treats well. Since it’s US.. it’ll go person better insurance? Yes. know. Honestly, think would quit was. fucking madness many areas. Makes sense. case, yes suppose “doing much”
However, point making was... need shit ton that.

“We hope millions doses available. still, might enough,” Schleifer told CNBC, saying eventual coronavirus vaccine would bring number cases. Pfizer, Moderna AstraZeneca recently provided data suggesting Covid-19 vaccines effective protecting majority people virus.” US government picking tab vaccinations. Health experts government officials: hey stay away people stay home much can. best way stop spread.

People: no. don’t think will.

Government: okay. we’re going close indoor dining won’t take virus seriously. 

People: surprised pikachu face. Get tested us first let us know side effects line say make work covid emergency ward emptying bed pans. Yeah article implying new information, even leading saying researchers ""discovered"" link. reality they've corroborated countless last studies. Yes, death sad, tell problems alcohol drugs suicides well? people still eat dead rotting animal corpses pumped antibiotics hormones? really. Even 99.9% protection claimed ""not good enough"". running underground speakeasies.... go they're easy find know right people.

It 20s without bunch hidden-but-easy-to-find speakeasies!   Extrapolate South Dakotas current death rate nationally would around 15,000 dead day, 105,000 dead week. 

How fuck poorly. arguably one easiest places country socially distance. school policy, state law work worker's comp NY hated controverting Covid claims. Trust me, us want deny compensation. never happened before, law pertaining yet. I've seen, claimants eventually given PTO back given compensation. Less 99%. Present long lasting symptoms ~half people. 5-10% hospitalization rate, hospitals reaching capacity many areas, lead even deaths. rural areas nation Upper Midwest/Plains (Dakotas, Iowa, etc) already seeing virus receded last 1-2 weeks. already approaching viral burnout. 


This article nonsense. far new imaginary friend fine. downvoted badly? I’m therapist feel pain. hope things get better. Oh? don’t tell Personal Responsibility Rugged Individualism?

Some tough love might order. I'm sure muh Island coming soon thing successful countries act nationally, decisively collectively compliant little bunch goody-two-shoes. Depending cultural outlook either great pathetic. 

I think great. NZ well. 

Sad see many Europe USA authority issues. would know 100% never ever happening ever matter do. That's going away, like last year. Vaccinate apply school. first outbreak following lawsuits, school change policies. Yeah keep seeing whole lotta back normal Easter, I’m betting Mid-Summer (like late-June/early-July) Canada least. people saying it’ll take till end 2021 people understanding one blessings curses virus age-stratified mortality hospitalization is. 

Blessing means normal 50 vaccinated, curse vaccine bad young wouldn’t spread much since we’d taking much seriously. Different previous recessions, countries introduced furlough schemes. Despite protection receive result, furlough still frequently report strong worries uncertainty job loss.

It's still leagues better we've got here, next nothing. wealthy countries sort setup pay companies keep employees payroll libros well jobs come back done. 

We not, people work play UI roulette small businesses go bankrupt big businesses rest war chests. course, countries actually work managing pandemic get build back better, economy-wise, instead pretending pandemic exist wondering people shopping. Ship fools you, personally cant wait go back movie premiers pub nights news we've getting recently vaccines getting better better. bit much ask suppose. figured mobile morgues stuff probably know someone hospital dead maybe they'd learn....but maybe not.  citizen third world country, truly blessing us.

Uh-huh, see. mean end. I’m worried district’s plan options be. Elementary aged kids also weren’t clinical trials, either stay virtual despite vaccine staff get (unlikely), go back third trimester spring bring safety measures protect myself, get vaccine despite doctors’ recommendations, take unpaid leave can’t afford right unpaid maternity leave. decision yet, vaccine likely cost German patients anything pocket they're public health care system, like 98% us. live country already bought doses Pfizer Moderna vaccines probably getting one J&amp;J candidate. otherwise depends live.
