0,2020-10-15," huge flooding rain blows through. wait till over. declare flooding issue currently rainfall rate negligible.

Your argument completely disingenuous. lord made

/s Haha, like pair bickering roomates live us, we're emotionally invested outcome fight wondering happen next. makes feel rather scared, wish remote classes instead actually go college. want get infected, thus infecting family shit college. I'm thinking dropping year, fear COVID factors. I'd hit it. Ok, 100% normalcy, things like..

I mainly want go back school actually sit lecture hall. Another yr online uni would suck.

Also, would love start playing sports again.

Im worried parties massive gathering, in-person learning, meeting new people, actually able sports, go gym, etc... still lack PPE? though spring kind thing. doubt this, I'm curious would elaborate? purpose system thought good idea electing fascist demagogue right elected dude made pandemic response team. Idk.. something Ben Ghazi butt emails. mean would — president proves covid makes stronger ever get virus /s 11 day quarantine...did read article? always funny bigots move goalpost like did. Classic smooth brained move. Tfw one respects kriek waifu  aligns human beings actually assess personal risks behave real world, behave ""everyone pitched in""

You're acting like herd immunity policy choice anyway--it's not. endpoint thoughts contrary based fantastical notion mask distance hope virus goes away. notion irrational prayer. America never best prepared. propaganda AmErIcAn ExCePtIoNaLiSm.  Leadership Oh agree, pointing restaurants closing earlier also opening earlier would little stop spread virus - that'd make curfew bit arbitrary bullshit rule (which already IMO) could turn reduce public support measures. 32 self-reported short long-term symptoms general adult population cohort comprised 233 COVID-19+ cases, 3,652 SARS-CoV-2-negative controls, 17,474 non-tested individuals.

I’m sure think implications words “general population survey” are. 

Statistics based sampling - precisely - applicable population large extent sample representative population. 

This sample includes 3 groups: 

- confirmed COVID-19+ cases, 
- 3,652 SARS-CoV-2-negative controls,
- 17,474 non-tested individuals

The sample confirmed covid cases representative population confirmed covid cases sample significantly higher hospitalization rate population confirmed covid cases. 

Statements like sample confirmed covid cases: 43.4% COVID-19+ cases symptoms lasting longer 30 days 24.1% still least one symptom 90 days

These applicable population “all confirmed covid cases” sample representative. sample representative, stats tell us sample, population. cannot, this, conclude 43% confirmed covid cases symptoms lasting longer 30 days. 10% people symptoms 30 days. includes everyone general population, terrifying. 

If you’d like terrified, go it, study warrant terror. First, don’t see 10% number, good time look sample characteristics note Nevada (excluding Las Vegas). 

More importantly, let’s take look SELF REPORTED symptoms (this method also carries selection bias distorts sample; people symptoms unlikely fill survey). 

The symptoms reported include: 
- runny nose 
- lower back pain 
- fatigue 
- sore muscles 
- headache 

You might notice none unique covid commonly experienced. 

The commonly self-reported symptoms: 
- runny nose 
- sore throat 
- lower back pain 
- headache
- sore muscles 
- body aches 
- fever 

But here’s interesting thing longitudinal study - 32 symptoms survey *changed* time. highlights symptoms 30 days survey: 
- acid reflux 
- decreased alertness 
- tinnitis 
- difficulty concentrating 
- back pain
- confusion 

Difficulty concentrating one higher reported symptoms 30 days. 

If you’re interested, initial survey [available doesn’t seem information survey used collect 30 day symptoms. 

Honestly, expecting see simple, run mill flaws, reading study survey really seems sketchy. think Really Unamerican Massive Poop stores finding them? Literally everywhere I'm half dozen waitlists various e-retailers. MIS-A, ""multi-system inflammatory syndrome adults,"" adult form dangerous condition first seen kids spring caused inflammation around heart organs rash. People need suck forgo thanksgivings safely. partner planning strictly isolating (no trips grocery store outside) week, getting tested, isolating test comes back, going parents. 

We normally pretty low risk work home don’t outdoor dining, going lock even limiting trips apartment. doubt everyone would this. lived Canada I'd want build wall make America pay it. guys stay safe love all.

The real news Quebec pretty bad Covid-19 wave right - worse several adjacent US states, including New York look infections per capita. testing much worse, may undercounting cases. 

Quebec, Population 4.5 million, 24,460 tested, 969 new infections 

New York State, population 19 million
1,469 new cases, around 125-150K test One week me. Ive tested positive well. low risk Naval Ships? India? still worse 4x population. lost anyone due covid? have. Tell bunch lies fucking idiot. news, understanding complexities kinds situations make intelligent. Normalcy level able worry going friends house, restaurant , wedding ? Yeah probably.

Normally 100% jam pack students residence? No, shortly follow fall- date bring new students already past therefore can’t really start new ‘normal’ school year December.

I think first time students able enter university normal freshmen year fall ‘22. living outer suburbs Paris tell weather really switched winter mode, earlier weak walk work freezing (to point could clearly see breath people wearing masks), raining grey - winter certainly come winter colds! problem is, 52 last Friday, 27 two weeks ago. spring never went 40 deaths per day. numbers yet terrible, trajectory definitely is. past one week, sudden 3 people KNOW well COVID, 2 still suffering hospitalized yet point YET. know large concerns like Caterpillar sit COVID info releases info workforce status COVID Republican knuckle draggers suckle teat hegemonic billionaires instead actually representing constituents believing “functional government,” charge. Obviously. see going this. I'm sure fully agree understand point. 

There great deal information we've learned. IFR 3-4% like stated way back March April. IFR 65 (regardless co-mordbidities) definitely .2% (probably even lower). 

COVID certainly impactful event 70. looking CDC page death total number people died age 65 42,963. 575,023 deaths people age 65. means COVID caused 7% deaths age. 

That equal total died ages 65 74. 43,927 COVID deaths people ages 65 74. Overall 437,155 deaths age group. COVID makes 10% deaths dying ages 65 74. want compare older groups even stark. age 75, 116,153 deaths by/from/with COVID. 10% total number deaths people age 75. Overall, 1,191,459 Americans age 75 died year.

If younger 44, COVID deaths account 3.8% deaths. looking CDC chart encompasses May September taking total deaths 44 6155 puts CFR .28%. already low. Now, take view 10 infections every confirmed case, looking IFR .028% 44. double flu rate age group comparable activity live age ranges. Certainly concerning much restrict activity flu - sick probably stay home show symptoms feel sick anything different life - like even think it.

We even removed people co-morbidities stage like cancer survivors et al. Thus, think find look logically numbers understand probability many people accounted risk made determination, especially age 44, ""I might get bad"" that's probability says. think risk appropriate. fine people I'm going die statistically true. suffered heart attack three years ago spending year losing almost hundred pounds diet exercise. lose weight, arteries blocked, can't unblock far know. heart attack occured running gym. Four months heart surgery back gym, also went covid weird heart patient/gym rat combination. huge bodybuilder type knew almost died virus. lay anyone low. Flying simply isn’t safe unless proper PPE cloth mask doesn’t begin cut it. I’m saddened this. moved family member home, unsure getting help need home health worry aren’t protected enough. 
Hate right one. Imagine we’re way government worked top bottom always every function (embedding pols function). tell anything Chiba says believable coronavirus, financial performance companies, anything all. correct. Soap hand sanitizer neutralize coronavirus, doesn’t one little-known superpower soap has.

“Soap disrupts sticky bond pathogens skin, allowing pathogens slide right off. neutralizing virus soap, you’re also physically knocking hands,” Pastula said. “Hand sanitizer doesn’t that.”

The bridge chemical differences water fat. That’s need soap clean greasy frying pan” Pastula that’s makes what’s coating particular virus? It’s layer fat,” Pastula said. “Soap molecules pry fatty layer particular virus break up, thus inactivating virus.” think nice, form heritage. Surely people originated city came trier wanted feel home. sound like something Onion, true... main channel Polish ministry health sharing stats updates Twitter, growing number deceased providing exact info made messages lengthy. talking Cus MuRikAnS selfishness plague Damn really? yall dont expect normalcy fall?

Even mass-spread vaccine distribution thing April '...and modern medicine' ? Yes, clearly simple. yet afraid we’ll re-elect him. brigading sub indicator. select countries sure tho.

Im Canadian, family/roots India, hard hit there, Im sure many years travel  Exactly, rejoice misery loose hockey skiing, this. help - know hospitals get $230,000 every time mark someone COVID? /s Leadership failure, plain simple. also said virus wasn’t contagious China handled well. Take pick believe close borders province (quebec) situation worse USA lol.... wait years - even anti-maskers saying things survivors like, “Well, knew prevent it. careful listened experts.” Trump kept pandemic going as. Tool suppress voting, funnel people mail voting turn postal system. sure, Comrade Leao. it’s literally yet that’s say normal, mean school social distancing masks? Ash? you? people really want touch fire see themselves, huh? virus China brought over? think guys fail realize one world made significant gain. that’s trumps fault too. 

Have fear, man hasn’t done shit 47 years come rescue, right? wonder even vote multimillionaires billionaires buddy whoever power get royal treatment. Guys! Two vaccines paused US get eliminated best case half number Americans fauci said much longer timeline. It’s low chance every vaccine work safe Right? Sometimes get thousand yard stare say ""I went Smackdown taping February year. sat next father two kids want mother irritating child also want there..."" Yes, presentation adult. ""slightly mixed"", meaning genetically mostly western European also mixed African ancestry mother's side. news came kawasaki like presentation children immediately recognized mirroring symptoms. particularly Interesting relation fact heart attack three years ago take medication, one beta blocker ace2 reuptake inhibitor along low dose aspirin daily. wonder helped situation all. reduced zero crowd gone politicization cliff like it’s hoax crowd. normal people caught middle. Don’t downvote person working out. Fitness equipment non existent retail market. fuck Russia state finances Portugal? Well, let's look data together. Huge unemployment, Health Care, rich getting incredibly richer despite middle class disappearing, massive government corruption, President seems worship dictators. Looks like third world country me. CDC changes like wind

Blame current administration. Assuming safe big thing-two top four vaccines candidates paused safety reasons.....this ridiculous optimistic. muh herd mentality? Thanks trumpy dump GOPee enablers. guess we're like constantly drunk, bickering downstairs neighbors. Sorry. That's healthcare luxury. 

Not right life experience lost restrictions outweigh potential risk serious critical outcome?

‘I’d rather take years life life years’ - country guy 😉 yet confirmed false postive link says. He's still quarantine. World Health Organization announced Friday long-awaited results six-month “Solidarity Therapeutics Trial” endeavored see existing drugs might effect coronavirus.

The study, peer-reviewed, found four treatments tested — remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir interferon — “ little effect” whether patients died within month whether hospitalized patients recovered.

Most already ruled out. remdesivir, repurposed malaria drug, classified standard-of-care United States, approved use COVID-19 UK EU. Supplies drug limited, European Medicines Agency reviewing whether remdesivir causing kidney problems reported patients. think important informed possibly part encourage others wear masks simply stay home. Cutting information acting nothing happening allows things get much worse.

It's still important vote try get Trump booted office, example.

There's lot do, said, understand importance mental health. Sometimes really need break talk deaths, inequality, bigotry USA abroad.

What Reddit turned notifications phone, deleted Reddit app iPad use Reddit desktop. funny enough besides subreddit GamerGhazi, I'm mostly iPad subreddit chatting tech. also try avoid arguments anti-maskers general bigots come across. two weeks... season played Madden Considering virus stay skin hours, want constantly adjusting mask. could put virus particles directly mask, would likely breathe in. Everyone expert interwebs guy situation (night owl + social anxiety). Belgium students typically go home weekend - always take last train around midnight usually carriage (almost) exclusively myself. Assuming Belgium going implement nighttime curfew well somewhere next days, I'll either forced take crowded train day completely alone small studio months campus lab work take huge toll mental health. Seriously fuck that, depending consequences/fines I'm going risk breaking curfew. challenge everyone also knows indoor restaurant wildly unsafe, need allow keep us hobbling along I'm going go digging history posts back May-June claiming Oxford vaccine would complete September. last spike summer. Cases rise mid June. Deaths mid July. mar/April Here's delivery *free downvotes* ordered. Ok, made one big mistake:

I assumed tricked propaganda, appears that's it; rather, actively trying propagandize. guys lot good stuff pick from, I'll take Westmalle tripel mainstream beers\* day week.

\*) including specialty stuff find good liquor / beer store. Arrogance sound like someone roots virus man. Especially much push reinfection common thing Nice Dashboard, know chance decided this? dead:** 10/10/2020, Ministry Health stopped providing data age deceased"" Sounds like indentured servitude Yeah fair enough, regardless EUA delay contingent FDA policy Efficacy data coming late. even efficacy data comes 1-2 weeks late, won’t actually delay FDA EUA much since need wait full safety data anyways restrictions eased


numbers come back two months


lockdown fatigue, let go


becomes second US


calling Nope, started Reagan crowd, boomers. ideology, generation, made difference. U.S. world's best prepared nation confront pandemic.

Really? prepared small island nation like New Zealand? gym since March myself, even reopen. go climbing gym. built small wall backyard, everyone afford even backyard.

I lots friends work there, get amazing insurance, volunteered pay dues help closed still do. 

The rumor heard without reopen additional aid, would shut December. see numbers.

But gym tight mask policy zero known cases spread. seems silly drive hundreds unemployment, we'd restaurants open months. 

As mentioned, still go. talk people go time. care anymore. virus scary enough sacrifice years life.

I mean, US going fight disease nationally. Even actually tried, several states would fought court many people would refused comply.

The virus stay. question is, could decide, much people would let suffer economically much debt would take keep things closed people want risk lives them. There's simply good answer.

I would take lots debt things much closed down. state would probably many less cases deaths. I'd kidding job weeks election happens. people ready take risks. 

We're minority. Because...not even leadership...but actual bad leadership. Stop waiting 🤣 link. calls liar he's one lying 🤣🤣 people live obviously. Two words... “J.” them. Peoples' inability listen lack common sense. Fox News considerably less reliable news sources. Trump Exactly. Especially cure hospitals doctors provide. EquIvAlEnT 9/11 eVeRy 17 HouRs

Ok but...this post Luxembourg? Im “denialist”, oppose bad government policies compare US. compare e.g. France Italy even better life expectancy less cardiovascular morbidity less healthcare spending. look Netherlands, 9% population hospitalized per year. Germany 21%.

I'm happy aspects system cost-effective ones. generates happiness though. Waiting times procedures close none existing. 2017 federal elections, health care barely ranked 10th (!) important campaign issues. Yes rules explicitly discuss it. time alt-right blame new Democratic president congress. Insurance companies aside, want know healthcare costs US, numbers answer. Supply demand, fewer doctors means charge more. Fewer hospital beds means hospitals charge more. wife physician move away city residency many doctors wanted stay there, physician pay like 50% less cities. wanted move rural area would pay 25-50% national average depending remote got. best explanation I've seen. got suite deal comes lack education, lack basic critical thinking skills, ignorance. I'm sorry? Also evidence real professors PHD paid off? example Dr. Gabriela Gomes, mathematician studying infectious disease epidemiology, professor University Strathclyde, Scotland. posted Twitter signed uses mathematical models population friends believe ""personal responsibility"".

but side note, responsible actions stupid friends never would made college. Answer trump republican cronisim. Intentional sabotage party power. clear day. There's mystery here. Hate burst bubble US form best prepared nation. Places like South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore dealt SARS back 2003 comprehensive measures dealing coronavirus outbreaks CDC US.  worlds best prepared nation confront pandemic

Article goes list detail assertion absolutely false nation truly prepared tackle pandemic magnitude Simple... one word, Trump. Trump dismantled Obama started it, says save money know that's true. brain dumpster fire. Seek help! Numbers deaths starting go up. Well invent pioneer lot cool things here, like cars, airplanes, Internet, personal computers, human travel moon, etc. 

Maybe keep innovation smart folks stay alive. Malicious mismanagement top, down. take responsibility stupid friends? Idk maybe started Trump fired emergency pandemic team back 2018. 2 years ago. pandemic team. Remember that? Remember Obama made pandemic team stop Ebola nasty diseases like SAARS related diseases? Yeah trump fired whole team back 2018 remember saying that's good idea. WOW look that. America worst country world COVID. Venn diagram, itd circle compassion fellow man noted.  I'm saying notable scientists backing - always find someone topic thats controversial.

I referring signatures like ""Dr Person Fakename"" ""Johnny Bananas"". Survival fittest sucks. Seriously. dedicated last 15 years life eating healthy body building everything right, still end stage kidney disease work extra hard everything decades.

Now fucking Joe Blow 6 pack gut hacking cough decades smoking never wears masks laughs ""the sheeple"" better chance surviving I, person ton immunosuppressants, does. I'm everything right. Hunker meet anybody face-to-face don’t to!!! Accept things going weird year nobody knows it’ll better everybody knows SUCKS yet still deal it, tell kids you’ll Halloween candy treasure hunt house/yard, talk family via Zoom text phone whatever takes. Send packages friends cheer up. Call neighbors ask need help. Stay physically far away people. Keep hand sanitizer person times possible. WEAR MASKS 7-day supply wash let air out. facemasks hurt ears nose something, try different mask ear-saver gadget way make comfortable; don’t face shape. SKIP ANYTHING ACTUALLY IMPORTANT IMMEDIATE SURVIVAL! Occasionally eat shitty meals you’re actually hungry acknowledge they’re shitty hunger meals it’s better reduce trips grocery store. Think ahead holidays could still fun despite things same. Don’t friggin’ travel unless to. Vote, safely. Think people remember they’re hurting too. kind thoughtful. Remember interconnected humanity. Take vitamins try keep overall health good. Look forward better days. Don’t give up. ignored plan. 


Then used crisis make money removed comment reason; going magically non-rule-breaking repost verbatim. saying ignore it.

I assume English first language, English ""let's ignore..."" facetious way saying ""you ignoring...""

I pointing way person could claim week's numbers lower last weeks numbers simply ignores actual numbers. Another pointless news pointless stats. never voice room, CDC told fuck herself. trust scientists, particularly find multiple peer reviewed studies make comparisons with. Relying expertise area lack good way get along IMO. said, data mostly cloudy point. plenty good bad mix right able prove whatever want either side fence.

However, believe premise correct conclude 250k dead states 0.2% total infected? Really? many people would infected 0.2% mortality 250000 dead? really think many infected 328 million? Uhhh, probably generous. quote want say, 'Thank Lord be.' That's is,"" said.

Good thing read whole article... Love someone confirmation biases. Trump. Trump how.  Fun fact: WH pandemic response team Obama respond Ebola outbreak. Trump dismantled 2018 save money. really wished still team now.  Looking what's happening west, Asian perspective, seems mind boggling. 

I'm worried elderly parents, comorbids, catch disease die. 

Similarly, feel sense empathy towards elderly people. friends parents, grandparents. diabetes, others heart issues. 

Firstly, herd immunity major flu. E.g. 1918 H1N1 spanish flu, - 2009 H1N1 pandemic. 

If let virus go unchecked, many people would die, many would get sick (and long term side effects). 

We may deal forever, like H1N1. 

I personally simultaneously reduce spread, chance getting sick wearing mask social distancing. 

This whole thing STOPPED proven, temporary measures (Australian, NZ, China) like lockdown. 

It's brainer. 

Why USA nothing, pushed message whole lack response Covid hoax? I'm american nurse, german doctor? nurses really start IVs? blood draws? seems like poor use resources physician it.

Also mid levels well utilized, especially hospital setting. There's reason MDs hire US assist lot in-patient care. Trump president like breaking race horses leg race even began. could finished funneling money finished funneling CDC!!!! Dark Money Destructor? types articles headlines seem summarize incredibly complex situation without nuance. 

From start official policy WH COVID task force differ state support local/state actions.

Whether agree decentralized policy debate. 

However, policy respecting state’s rights top priority, least terms Constitutional Republicanism form government (which USA designed be) probably right one important things executive do…. 

In terms public health strategy probably best. 

An overarching federal policy may legal consequences (i.e. jail/fines non compliance) direct contradiction aforementioned. may also civil rights consequences open litigation.

The USA always going tough case; population size, cultural factors (civil liberties/rights; Freedom!), excess comorbidities, states rights, localized private health care systems executive bad public messaging; even say right thing (stopped clock that) challenged half population.

My main issue COVID across countries largely Fed/state-province/local/health authorities took position DIFFERENT times.  Exactly. Don’t DARE close fucking gym. worst learned anything next time happens. whole point post revolved around false idea current numbers lower last week, blatantly false.

Here actual numbers:

  Tues. Oct 06	786
  Wed. Oct 07	831
  Thurs. Oct 08	836
  Total:		2453
  
  
  Tues. Oct 13	916
  Wed. Oct 14	970
  Thurs. Oct 15	596
  Total:		2482

And remember, number Thursday 08/10 essentially complete, number Thursday 15/10 increase significantly next report.

For example. 09/10 FHM said 657 new cases 08/10. next report 13/10 number 08/10 increased 657 835.

So... saying FHM's incomplete information Friday slightly lower incomplete information last Friday... number manipulate way like. It’s also sad folks saving government crap full money taking care folks homes ensuring don’t end skilled nursing facilities usually awful care standards increase care costs. Fun fact covid derniers! 
I friend works pharmaceutical faculty. facility given huge grant research develop vaccines c19. Well days ago shut due huge break, turns one techs belive covid real! ended bring virus ended puting 8 people (potentially cases develop) ventilators!

And yes still says covid fake socials. Florida 3400 new cases, 95 new deaths today. sound smart. Germans absolutely live longer people U.S. less morbidity. also far, far, better U.S. COVID response. Perhaps best world still something U.S. envy. That's Republicans do. ideas own, simply oppose whatever Democrats want. That's sum total ""philosophy"". entire party He's denialist troll trying gin examples craziness. See link. genuine question. EU surpassed US new cases yesterday. 

Per million inhabitants? eu 1.5 times amount people. Plans great. best work followed. plans followed even addressed late. Every hour beyond 40 you’re working lowering hourly rate you’re salary. You’re giving reduced-rate labor. Trump Secret Police control masses Ebola scare, Fed invested tons building high level treatment hospitals across country. funding since dried facilities since shuttered improvements costly maintain. going suggest marry someone afford sponsor you. saw already family. basically playing Russian roulette. healthy 30 even get corona side effects worse bad cold.

Under 30??? people whether 30 good bit past it, going cold, flu symptoms all. also important remember statistically unlikely die, mean won't. people concerned risk long term illness complications.

The death rate virus tiny people aged 20-44 starts go past that, even 60+ people really worry: &amp; Two words: TRUMP REPUbLICANS Though fires contribute direct sign universe ever got NJ...

&amp;#x200B;

Driving get groceries long day series shitty days, asked universe sign things going get better... 

I round corner right western horizon, blood fucking red sun slowly setting...

Not quite good omen hoping :/ ACA made life way worse people, now, addition insurance, fined insurance. 

ACA provided coverage millions *option* get affordable health insurance. avoid fines, get insurance exchanges, have, well, affordable plans. Granted, states shitty choices only, states republican control, everything sabotage ACA. much Obama's presidency democratic control House Senate, lot space left promised campaign. 

For first two years only, passed ACA time frame. Short answer: dumbfucks Donald J Trump keymaster something even *be* planned. pointed out, people changed minds strategies. World experts doctors wrong right wrong. 
So get shit stool stfu. could lot worse. right response. Cause Democrats claim propaganda arms start spinning it. Yeah, seems like dealing slow burn years. 

Even vaccines work well, Merican Rugged Individualism half us avoiding vaccine masks... USA going look like? 

Five years now, still evaluating businesses want enter based politically driven anti-mask signs, rest world basically back normal? 

This feels like science-fiction level event. asked week ago germany (in Emergency) free icu capacity read.

Today NRW (a - right description - state germany) approved 80 icu beds cases netherlands. Idk offered already good work together. 

Sorry english. New York California 900 cases North Dakota way worse sounds someone bigger state Americans can't handle idea best everything matter often evidence contrary presented them. 2 3 months low numbers large chunks populous starts ignore safeguards. Virus goes apeshit again. Illinois we've wearing masks months, online school, restaurants closed limited (sometimes outdoor seating allowed), etc. yesterday reported state 40% recent covid-19 cases. think overblown (although deaths hospitalizations seem increasing much cases, suggesting perhaps gotten better treating possibly become less deadly), think numbers less reliable (more likely underreporting cases deaths).

But becoming less convinced state really managing better another. yesterday TX state decline, I'm guessing way lax relative Illinois. Sweden afford easy. want to. Sweden de facto one party state since WWII ""industrialists"" call shots. wealth country. Water, like toilet? President Donald Trump popular county, local officials quickly abandoned mask mandate summer getting heat local residents amid president’s criticism policies. Donald Trump cult. Ignorance Christ people really skip sections ballot? gonna stick trends. Rt number really important think anyway. florida, eh? Arrogance, American people see arrogant are. believe propaganda country ability win anything. best president, best medicine, best technology, best everything.

I read stat deaths Canada twice death due Cocid-19 USA per 100,000 People. country similar population make-up, living standard.

I doubt it, another example American alternate reality supress numbers perceived benefit.

Add American Covid-19 deaths together Excess Death numbers ratio Canada American equal, skew numbers politicians say American better.

Politics Blood Sport , unfortunately blood Populace spilled ground here.

The Electorate, people chose Govern paying price decision, Live Learn Dead people can't vote. Yes, CDC holds many vaccine patents, closely intertwined NIH Vaccine Research Center. Moderna’s COVID vaccine, NIH claiming joint ownership, according documents obtained Axios analysis Public Citizen. Fauci doesn’t want HCQ succeed there’s enough money established drug. big money comes mandate new vaccine hundreds millions people. meant Fauci Fed health agencies general, inventor. always reactive proactive? posts social media 'plandemic'. wtf wrong people. don’t see well prepared. awful healthcare outcomes, assuming even afford it. barrier entry also fostered tremendous amount doubt medical science. 

So bunch unhealthy people running around trusting medical experts significant portion population forced work (and spread virus) literally die. 

I know personally would seek medical help contracted virus unless situation became life-threatening even I’d probably wait long like issues I’ve dealt going hospital mean insurmountable debt family would never recover. millions people America situation. 

That alone seems like recipe disaster even proper response virus, clearly, continue fail. 

This doesn’t even bring capitalism extremely fragile cannot deal massive events like pandemic without enormous cost (in case, human lives). Ummm, we’re filled large number idiots hang every word supreme idiot. reasoning probably reduce amount time available socializing.

I think incredibly dumb. dont like government micromanaging allowed socialize, think majority agree Herd strategy goal true every country. get vaccination program. claim Sweden herd immunity *strategy* false, debunked numerous times ...made immunity numbers half year.

This discussions models, always clear models. Norbottens län...

The local infectious disease doctor held presentation slide mentioning herd immunity, decide national policy. FHM Absolute disaster extremely ...your denial changing all.

Let's least try stay civil. Heh that’s wanted make sure knew didn’t blame you. exactly supposed do. Cheers! week, Top allegedly posted Facebook would offer 10% discount anyone came said “Happy Columbus Day,” apparent pushback Indigenous Peoples Day post went onto say: “And always 10% masks!! Merica!!” least he's less likely targeted assassination militias now.

In meantime, Dr Acton resigned gone hiding trying save lives. interesting herd immunity brought one ever talks benefit partial herd immunity. Ive seen studies show benefits early 10-20% infected.

So truly sheltered vulnerable young movers shakers country would get it, beat it, develope immunity, beneficial reducing spread future??? Literally every little bit helps. understand risky, rare long term effects shoot, even unlucky young age. flu lot characteristics never stopped living lives comment replied literally told you. South Korea. New Zealand another. 

And making false equivalence saying country takes precautions must outbreaks otherwise failures worth doing. one saying preventions 100% foolproof. Especially half US Europe large percentage people listening think hoax. Hard preventions work many following them. 

Look US. hottest spots country places conservative populace government taken minimal mandates little concern, even though rural areas much harder spread dense urban areas hit harder early helped limit cases. 

So, yes, dozens regions working. Another lost war Yep. even f'd Europe. guys influence knows borders.  didnt say was. said Trump said was. video got Walter Reed, though suppose could say taking Regeneron vaccine. yikes. Fuck China! China terrible global menace. Cannot trusted. China responsible creating, lying about, spreading yet another global pandemic. One more! Can’t wait next time again!!!! He's actually /r/NoNewNormal regular, that's really better. subreddit that's dedicated spreading misinformation still allowed thrive beyond me. Three weeks ago announced 150 million rapid tests would sent states coming weeks. know happening could lot testings soon quicker results. Hahahah, Unemployment party go womp womp!!! 'But wanna' - Boris pals. comes individualistic vs collectivism societies large serving corporate greed. would've thought getting people wear mask social distance weeks would controversial. everyone that, would BAU like Asian countries. boggles mind Dakotas population density whatever outbreaks. like definition everyone 2m apart stand. matter prepared people can't follow basic principles leaders willing enforce it. Best prepared? Source? Looks like sub administrator pro China minions, single word PRC tolerated. democracy sub, true communsit codes operation. Cynical sadists Mask mandates, listen CDC, promote testing, longer lock down, encouragement self quarantine, federal stimulus people rush back work, firing response team. top head.

Hell, Trump's xenophobic travel ban even ban travelers China, still allowed business travel several exceptions. 

Thats xenophobic, parts seemed guided towards stopping spread really, really, half-assed. Biden calling Trump listen CDC. problem seen wallet since neighbor visited. talking about, one worst medical systems world “Top faces possible penalties offering discounts non-mask wearing customers”

Top Frozen Yogurt downtown Durango faces possible enforcement actions allegedly offering discount customers came store without wearing face covering.

“This one little bit different usual complaint,” said Brian Devine San Juan Basin Public Health.

Earlier week, Top allegedly posted Facebook would offer 10% discount anyone came said “Happy Columbus Day,” apparent pushback Indigenous Peoples Day movement.

The post went onto say: “And always 10% masks!! Merica!!”

In attempt slow spread COVID-19, face coverings required state law indoor spaces social distancing cannot maintained.

Not long after, flood complaints came SJBPH’s portal reporting violations public health orders. Thursday morning, 76 complaints filed Top That, 58 since Monday.

Complaints also included numerous photos staff members customers wearing masks inside store.

Store owner Ryan Bartholomew respond requests comment. Thursday, appeared Top taken entire Facebook page. still pay back, hence student debt  grading based plans playbooks. hard understand? Best prepared? Obama depleted stockpile never refilled it. It’s everyone that’s ignoring it. It’s like 25% people even. keep using word. think means think means. 2 months last dose, two months efficacy. essentially end putting US weeks behind Canada Australia EU. fun tasty. Perhaps doctors wearing century. 

&amp;#x200B;

Nope, part doctor costume. blessed day, plague rats. Even Germany. really counting Germans obedient, seeing meteoric rise here. time wanna part show! looking good terms lasting 'til March. get abiding sub's rules :) Everyone allowed go Greece negative test. stayed there. Situation better back home. January least. Seems I’ve conditioned. First thoughts reading title Princess Bride. Lol could thunk letting novel virus roam free would lead nasty complicated sequelae? Cuz donold thump Capitalism helluva drug... testament much wrong leader worst time cost you. Look, know anecdotal scientific sense, Tampa Bay, known three people (1 dead, 2 quarantine b/c direct exposure) last six weeks tango covid. That’s last *several* months, expected personally know people. 

I honestly don’t know going Florida. lot people acting like nothing going on, personally know people impacted Covid, yet state numbers look.. bad summer? 🤷‍♀️

I keep I’ve doing... patient, wait vaccine. How? 

Simple answer: Trump Administration. Full stop, fault 100%. think correct say fastest spread.

Ohio 11581 cases last 7 days. That's 99.1 per 100k population time period.

Wisconsin 21867 cases last 7 days. That's 375.6 per 100k population time period. Yeah, warnings still must made     oligarchy needs excuse collapse US economy. economy based credit currency backed oil military last long. yeah, people 30s 40s obesity hypertension (or 'pre-existing conditions'l would die soon anyway, right? /s think making fun people care suffering animals something celebrated? Cute. /s Dr Amy Acton, Ohio one best early defences covid. GOP governor caved radicals party. drove good doctor death threats armed antisemitic nutcases stalking home.

[While Acton widespread praise steady detailed assessments pandemic, also faced harsh sometimes ugly pushback orders contributed closing businesses kept people home weeks. backlash included lawsuits, legislative effort strip authority, protests outside suburban Columbus home included people carrying guns. - demonstrations statehouse featured signs bearing antisemitic messages. Acton Jewish, one lawmaker referenced antisemitic slur. recently, organizers music festivals restaurant owners sued slow reopening Dr fauci told us wear masks France still online platform available school students used distance learning. Attendance mandatory even want distance learning can't. Classes packed. see kids removing masks traditional ""hi kiss"".

Also, protocol ridiculous, 3 kids need infected one clase class close.  HErD iMmUnItY iZ gReAt better sheltering old people? see slight uptick Sweden. death rate actually pretty freaking good weeks now.

I compared UK actually seeing uptick deaths unlike sweden Actually 150k. Yesterday 162k. also use tape nose bridge. use single-sided ""gentle"" blue medical tape 1. I'm allergic 2. dry skin stronger stuff hurts like mofo remove. think *its president thought wasnt legitimate threat kept downplaying Worth lib tears Honestly town councilmen higher part cult could kept 100k easy. Sad people aren’t listening one world’s leading epidemiologists.  president follow CERC purposefully made harder follow CERC. Sounds like simpsons reference  fairly correct UK begining Oct goes South... Translation : Westerners salty Xi listened Gao Fu instead dismissing like leaders scientists. We'll see hospitalization mortality curves follow like previous peaks. Obviously go up, high? IHME model, place, reduced projected deaths 400k year end around 260k. fact PPE smuggled via owner Patriots, diplomatic flights sympathetic nations sources. 

Like seriously Maryland put PPE dual guard undisclosed location State Troopers MD national guard fear would seized feds   need shut schools. One word: LEADERSHIP toddler, usually eat early. still can't fathom folks live across street sit dinner 2 young kids 10, yet nightly. son hard asleep then. Hell, I'm usually close bed then... fucking waste. 

It looks like vaccine readyd within thte next 3 months. end story.

I hate Trump loser piece shit.

But leader downplayed nothing. Yes 69 days national lockdown.
A little take account hard measures imposed areas. Stop lying backtracking now. literally said internal emails count. public admissions guilt count.

Great. Nobody hiding anything corona. Excess deaths myth conspiracy. Russian doctors fell windows accident. *impossible* lie herd immunity, obviously impossible assassinate several doctors. Sweden actually 12th worst country world, every country reports deaths accurately. Anything else unlikely *conspiracy theory*.

In reality difficult. Tegnell needs say two words publicly. Even email leaks complete disaster FHM. Good luck convincing population give Thanksgiving Christmas. pleasure. always appreciate someone breaking situation lazy doom gloom ""no duh"" comments. gives hope. Yes it’s like two states largest dense populations country would naturally spawning points fast-spreading global virus anything /s premise false.

Under Obama pandemic response team H1N1; disbanded profitable keep team running prepared (they ventilator shortage too).

The problem America operate government-managed, Healthcare all. therefore coordinated effort pandemic response always worrying generating profit Healthcare insurance companies.

There interstate agency coordinate healthcare (a single-payer).

There's problem. It’s mostly weather hate I’m big fan rainy overcast days summers hot last long love narrative certain group people get fault. careful.

Yet another group gets isn’t fault. Someone else gave them.

Fuckin’ Merica’ everyone saying everyone wearing mask..then come numbers going haywire? Probably akin right wing equivalent limousine liberal. 

Harsh rhetoric beliefs give damn enough anything efficacious it. Oh see saying. Yeah, absolutely right. Reputable name usually absent gouged I've seen. Well government refuses impose mandatory work home job allows it. ""encouraged"" it, said, enough change people's (in case, employers') habits.
Many people would like work home employer refuses reason.

As restaurants, people's mind goes ""since they're allowed open, must mean we're allowed eat there"". closing restaurants, government ""encouraged"" people eat out. already did, again, change people's habits. Correct. Experience expensive, plus resume gap. lot people facing future. See part post “attestation physician” Thus fulfilling Trump’s campaign promise, time election.. Checkmate. /s honestly think trump capable even thinking wrong. him, rest world wrong, him.

""Mistake"" ""I Wrong"" simply subroutines present tiny, input/output Trumputer (tm) OS.

His mental capacity demonstrably like insect - act / react rather sort conscious though processes. disappointed? others pointed article responsible 11 day period. Official recommendations quarantine possible exposure 10-14 days. happens limiting risk exposing others met time line based last interaction infected person.

What disappointed about? 30k today friend mine Paris published story Instagram dinner party 6-7 girlfriends like nothing happening LOL
It seems like truly don’t care see meant now. Yea, Indiana nonsense. Thank clarifying. anyone think virus tamed? easily wait outside months lockdown, continue low key spreading, return full throttle restrictions eased. 

The sensible solution long term solution, jackhammer lockdowns curbing rights. chance adverse effects? Sure. I'm dismissing it.

Think car manufacturer making new model car. times goes right one questions it. should, serious effects. problematic, like Pinto Toyotas floor mats. Humans survived prospered kinds social physical environments thousands years. ancestors would scoff you. gets groceries delivered car? still like 4 week wait list here. people really understand Covid spreads. understand, would debate keeping distance one another, wearing masks unavoidable social situations, limiting time spend around others enclosed spaces keeping children pets distance one another. humans social animals, hard-wired generations ingrained behavior gravitate towards one another always provided net benefit so. hard encourage behavior contradicts urge socialize stick - might convince someone always wear masks around strangers, around friends obviously know better catch Covid...who friends obviously know better...who also friends know better...that friends.... We’re together. :) No-name masks. Nothing major reputable manufacturers. Nitrile gloves $45 200, versus 2017 $14.

Egregious gouging. Crapware. ever was.  It’s data, it’s it’s presented. Florida takes data twists show % positive fashion logical epidemiologist would endorse. gives best figures report. John’s Hopkins takes data % positive 2-3x Florida reports. yup perspective, it’s 9k cases new cases per day Florida. peak 15k new cases never fully shut hospital system overwhelmed. Proud? month 8. stimulus coming. end sight. many take ""proven wrong?"" Damage done lunacy. disgusted hold asshats accountable perpetuating misinformation division. He's late. sure. peoples homes, crowded park trails, obviously restaurants. adds up. Quebecois think independent review board whatever called know patients get vaccine get placebo. also quite hygienic, keep distance, wear masks regular basis too. honest religion full God giving humanity common sense, humanity well I'm definitely it.

Repeatedly. 

And within religions, eithie rin holy texts themseleves wise praised leaders hsitory, quarantine guidelines, sees violating bad coward battle. following hurricane IIRC you’re acting like “oh there’s couple spinal issues big deal”. no, that’s problem. there’s couple people spinal issues testing means vaccine released thousands people could spinal issues. millions, probably like thousand. weeks ago told us people would begin get vaccinated November December. 

They need stop promising timelines especially vendors pause trials issues come up. Jets backup team, help application?? Immigrants? Seriously? mean stroll. prevent seeing parents? cops blocking front door? sadly lab knows, that's need triple blind trials.  prostitute? point I'll believe see it. I've gotten hopes many times many things year. negative, want disappointed.

I suspect entire next year (2021) spent similar dicking around like year. Maybe 2022 things finally start stabilize. clear attention span fortitude nation (specifically speaking USA) zilch. Eight months people act like decades. even damn year yet, already talking saying screw let spread herd immunity. everyone make next Christmas every year. must hard.

I'm sick virus next person, dammit, suck wear goddamn mask socially distance vaccines come rolling in. soon enough. guess week, everyone gives up. go. Still though. tests 17.5K/per province Ontario (Canada) alone. Netherlands people do. find hard fathom Netherlands can't test that. Ah, ok, peer reviews shit, disregard paper who's peer reviewed not. Good know. 
So order invalidate one like, throwing rest science bathwater.  
 
Gg, played yourself. everyone except America eradicated one close number cases America has? doubt GOP encourage voters yodel inside polling area, advertise prior Election Day. Expect Republicans next couple weeks. got real vaccine June.

Not nothing article says that, also says this:
 entered preferred group scientists, vaccinated infected.

Casting aside that's hope, clearly says they're sure. reason one 19 year old death news 200,000 old people deaths newsworthy. old ""man bites dog"" thing. Rare events newsworthy, common events not.

Sorry hear anyone dies this. really hope time next year, vaccine efficacy, treatments least reduce fatality ratesv somewhat, better understanding virus transmits, better protect ourselves.

But also expect year. “These guys” *never* burying 1000+ day April. highest daily death count 607 April 7 average month April around 400. Stop making stuff up, That's pretty racist dude. Shouldnt allowed amnesty cross border? Thats democrats keep telling me.

America allow poor uneducated people South America/ Mexico otherwise racist, Canada incredibly strict standards immigration fine. hypocritical.  Surgical masks would fine. I'll look again. Curfew? like mandatory party-till-6am order. Can't break curfew leave party. That's still 6 figure salary, I'm sorry anyone ""at top field"" education making 100k year really top field, even halfway there. good see admits wrong. Unfortunately, still many political sins atone for. useful spreading message realities COVID, imperative supported. trying figure truckers targeted get it! [Some MD Twitter convinced achieving herd immunity requires *95%* people infected can't true, it? I've heard 20-30% lower end, 60-70% higher end... *never* 90s. Half coronavirus news coverage constant stream outliers (with half constant stream noisy data context). ridiculous.

Imagine covered forces world extract pound flesh way. Cheers, long road, looks like there's finally finish line sight. I'm really excited see mates again. 3rd point wd seem indicate receive actual vaccine wd testing learn possible different lighter infection? suspect I'm gonna need therapy help get used crowds again. get really anxious start panic every time go Target days. 3 weeks proper shelter place could saved whole year bs many lives too. don’t think world afford make mistake again.

*Victoria checked chat* I'm speaking deaths, thought much bigger time frame. virus stay long time many people get sick multiple times. seems gets serious time get sick weakened immune system, one symptom caused Covid-19. may lucky one time, two times, thee times, five times - point, luck. people died year sick old part, including recent case certainly already know, sick *once*. Imagine situation looks ten years. twenty. course including cases like main cause death secondary infection (caused weakened immune system caused Covid-19). truly believe seen tip iceberg comes deaths. Things take time develop. One 100 1%, One 10,000 .01%. One 10,000,000 .00001%. prior post waaay off. call bullshit. propaganda Big Airline paid good money spread business collapse. problem sounds like rare based incredibly limited data. impacted lack testing first months disease. lack testing symptoms mild symptoms first time. high threshold samples sequenced different strains.

The reality yet know common uncommon is. Sure assume we'll die, especially quickly, pretending fact rare fact. been, what, 8 months since whole thing really started countries? many people act like we've locked decades. buckle down, wear mask, socially distance, wait vaccines start making difference 2021.

Even one life saved worth it. guess question effective vaccine possible? hard thing this: we're going rebuild relationships.

Perfect timing. 

Just spent hour phone Dad. 

I love much frank conversation. 

Nothing solved win. Bridge building important. 

Headed drum. Well, Chinese live country communist party lock away everybody...with without valid reason. Locking people area/city/district really extreme measure think need slow spread, ultima ratio everything else fails. Empathy taught, showing complete disregard life discourages empathy ""pre existing condition"" crowd real quiet thread. Here's truth.

Now testing fairly ubiquitous widespread, see true magnitude covid season.

We hearing countries getting would equal well six figures US population. already happened before, seeing it. time deaths hopefully crazy due lots advancements, time tell sure.

Guess what, six figures easily coming US. may less control thought. we've done impact, certainly seems seasonality plays big role, believe improvements partially erroneously credited control measures.  Well practically half year realize this. 

You can’t fix stupid. curfew Melbourne 2 months, due hundred cases per day. We're still stage 4 lockdown still fighting last outbreaks. 
Do know long France need lockdown curfew for? 
Most schools also setup online platforms, school/class really relying Zoom etc run lessons send printouts stuff kids home. Ha, point. Really neat slid advocacy loosening restrictions plea people bare minimum he's finally started deciding cases rising rapidly; rising rapidly careless people like boss responsible anyone safe working conditions White House. Read what? article indeed says Fauci's estimate based vaccines clinical trials proven safe effective. something know? also said reason healthy people wear masks early on. don’t think mid June changed mind that. Meanwhile Australia, we're currently averaging 18 cases per day whole country (a good chunk returning travellers hotel quarantine).

Melbourne still lockdown (gradually easing it) they're averaging 9 new cases per day. state borders still closed.

Our international borders going closed long time yet. John’s Hopkins get numbers/data? Kansas City area hospitals, facing biggest influx coronavirus patients since pandemic began, refusing ambulances beds already filled, according leading doctor St. Luke’s Health Wednesday night, eight metro hospitals emergency departments reported high volumes patients temporarily stopped accepting ambulances, Marc Larsen, Operations Director Saint Luke’s COVID Response Team, said phone interview Thursday. Another old man dead he’s rich famous gets experimental treatments. many almost 1000 dead Americans today would able get treatment? many yesterday? many tomorrow? guffawed. First baby due next month. family crap brutal right now. 

Parents follow rules whatever please, upset allowed see baby. people asking need see baby, need keep baby safe. acting like enjoy saying hard us right now. Driving wife crazy past weeks. agree everything say. think missing point somewhat.

People become reasonable, emphatic, responsible, educated compassionate. People are. anything, COVID fatigue, people become less careful.

We also know Western governments enforce rules stringent enough bring virus down.

That leaves us figure public policies get us next next several months, years. recognizing many individuals consider COVID risk acceptable, factor policies. He's obese fuck, weird. see, seems like offer anything value ain't gettin' in. like it. Inbred  Yeah, coworker 3 months started getting ability taste back. symptoms dismissed.  virus new. documenting this. downplaying this. ""You seem discounting fact stupid people make life difficult elves unnecessarily.""

I dont see causality guy. Could case sure, necessarily? country founded Jews able live freely religious customs beliefs.

Wait, what's that, people Israel *also* annoyed Orthodox blatantly flaunting covid restrictions? Well, nevermind, then. Feels like minority now. that, got cases less 60/day.

Then contact trace, isolate cases, generally care. we're 10000/day. doctors nurses family thru hell reporting big upticks hospitalizations CLEAR data bad is. fear people impacted die non-Covid issues simply space them. delay heart attacks strokes there's permanent immunity, second infections worse ... bruh that's gonna cost shit-ton money without upside benefits. clearly care images decided antagonize half world, would care flying empty plane. rich countries rich people do: throw money problems, expect got money’s worth. poor people/countries outmuscle hard way, it’s big “shocker”


Expecting money solve problems great way front-running ass take big Loss. think anybody suggesting there's *no* immunity conferred, seems likely permanent. Let's say people get maybe six months' immunity - expect see first trickle reinfections starting pop ... surprising early viral replication kills people time this.

What does? That's necessarily true. vaccine provide better immunity actual infection May live _uninteresting_ times. invented it, [the [the [the  huge country state governments conflict federal guidelines. ton bureaucracy political opposition every single decision. BLM matter screaming racism everything divisive election year. intellectually dishonest compare us small countries (South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore) handled pandemic better us none factors. always treated deaths due poverty bad sanitation Africa something unavoidable, life is. See could avoided little vaccine provide better immunity actual infection Yes.. somewhat along line 😀

Damn books! agree working together one setup. I've seen this, I've seen setups individual offices, too. case, virus might spread within one office next, spare rest company.

If hang group, likely share virus one got it. hang two groups, chances doubled groups. friends visits mom $Farfaraway … fetches copy virus everybody?

That's decide one not-too-big group people know like. know first 3 months Illinois (feb-apr), could get tested common place lack testing tests available every where. know 6 people personally COVID test later showed immunities. also know 3 people COVID won;t waste time money getting tested, common too

 8 million number bogus come people need number guess Also people spend time partying inside now. Outside it’s bit safer. Answer: US never best prepared nation, utterly confused, got reality check. Even now, deep vaccine development still articles coming “we never getting back normal” variety.

We know long immunity lasts, based reports reinfection, last long all.

1. Vaccine immunity lasts year more: gg corona easy noob.
2. Vaccine immunity lasts half year, give take months: still gg need farm bit secure W 2021.
3. Vaccine immunity lasts much shorter: we're actually boned.

I count chickens know sure option 3 board, _by means_ sure that. fact, people get reinfected within months, that's tip iceberg actually prove caught two different strains. fuck would even enforce lol. cops gonna round neighborhoods knock doors Dude city name like dont brightest candle chandelier guess china least east asia :D said would done election disappear. appears 3rd peak may occur election instead. Bro pro virus? That's messed up. stuff actually caused lot problems! Please reconsider stance. ?? whats like 3 people standing line anything comes current administration FDA/CDC Basically US voluntary giving away lead business markets culture things like movies foreign students coming study etc countries world willing follow science must done get covid control.

Until face fact accept science national hard lockdown contract tracing nationwide, BS covid safety theater, Covid-19 going rule USA nation fall behind countries right thing along. Sweden's rise case concerned experts. Y'all need stay diligent like rest us. Stack theory crockpot theories Romans fell. best prepared prior January 2017  Um yes.... People truly cannot handle discomfort. Ive awag family almost year. Holidays alone, family lives me, shit even spouse gone holidays. Suck buttercups freaken dinner, dinner ever get shit settle down. Trickle down! single country eradicated virus. better. Vietnam 1,500 cases 8 million; accounting pop size they're well. France hurting badly moment. ""There signs world speedily coming end: Bribery corruption common. Children longer obey parents, everyone writing book."" - Assyrian Tablet 2800 BCE ridiculous getting diagnosis knee exact reason. did, want treatment.

Third ortho trick. One top country. Figured fixed 15 appointments said below. Covid currently affecting everyone way globally. That's there's much uproar. 
TB primarily affecting 3rd world countries immediately relevant. uproar. 
 
 
I search news articles TB. still get spoken about, obviously face 24/7. Where's motivation? eased period 2 months, progressively tightening lockdown became obvious existing measures insufficient, time came it, still several hundred cases per escalation quarantining entire towns cities single cases. eradication looks like, full force start.

I think know things really went Italy.

They quarantined entire cities towns Lombardy (Codogno others nearby) right discovered first cases February 21st. Problem is, point virus already way widespread Lombardy contained - mortality started skyrocketing baseline around 23rd, means spread well underway 15th without anyone knowing.

Then March 11th enforced full national lockdown, closing everything including kind non-essential movement things mentioned. time, 80% official cases three regions north (of half Lombardy alone). basically two thirds country handful cases, even. means country endured lockdown harder NZ's Vietnam's, given actual number cases had.

The main problem Italy time discovered first cases already late virus already spreading Lombardy weeks. excess mortality province Bergamo went become highest entire world - higher Guayas Bronx. progressive escalation anything like that, completely different issue. alternative would shut Lombardy start - Lombardy random town middle nowhere, rather economic center country. says checked extracted samples using Vero E6 cells - using presence actual infectious virus test criterion. said that, stored samples dark SARS-CoV2 known rapidly degraded UV light, numbers arrived arguably worst-case.

There certainly nothing implausible - Influenza viruses known remain active surfaces several weeks Finally article tries learn countries handled well.

So much people died many jobs lost due mishandling virus giving headache. 

It could easily avoided stopping unessential travel quarantine incoming necessary travellers. People 1000 years ago even knew this.

All politicians take seriously jail. talk ""schools safe""

Yes, absolutely safe stick people together poorly ventilated rooms without masks. find many timeline predictions look ridiculous hindsight.

""James Bond delayed _November??_ Ludicrous!"" Slovenia another country well beginning. Sad see... Good. Waste time money people. There's real point that. That's intentionally setting impossible bar meet. However, Taiwan started masks+tests+contact tracing enforced quarantines/isolation, use that. lockdown. economy contracting like Sweden's is. done

Czechia threw massive party summer corona seemed over. _Narrator: over._ Krusty coming. Krusty coming. Krusty coming. Trump Yet kills million still. don’t panic demand countries shutdown save lives. total 1.4 million people died TB 2019 (including 208 000 people HIV). weren’t news networks crying it? banking vaccine covid Trump  Europe brink Covid Armageddon surges cases.

About 400,000 die Europe end year. thought faster that? People stopped listening. work health department IL region 1, pritzker introduced mitigations increase cases. Mainly, indoor dining time being. Well, there’s way enforce it. Local police departments municipalities spoken governor saying don’t care enforcing new rules. health department doesn’t procedures deal sort thing reach IDPH ask, “how enforce this?” say “talk states attorney” So, states attorney say? Nothing. don’t care. mean like don’t answer calls emails. Currently go document places aren’t following mitigations. idea happens next even though we’ve reached Idph, governors office, states attorney constantly. Anyway, there’s almost 0 compliance following mitigations. vast majority places open business usual indoor dining, masking. Fun times. great info! economy rebounded quickly 1918-1920 pandemic.

This may Great Depression depth, length. There's evidence though:  Autumn came people returned summer vacations, students went back studying due worsening weather people started spending time indoors general. respiratory-transmitted disease season, increase COVID cases expected by, think, everyone involved healthcare. never enough time.

I learned long time ago matter long live, life short.

That's problems ""no end dates"" this.

I'm guaranteed tomorrow. Neither you. Live best lives, friends. time heavy fines arrests. Spelled: T. R. U. M. P. WAY optimistic. Current vaccines prevent infectious, elderly take vaccines well. We'll still social distance 2021, though reality people give damn vaccine. Arrogance, moronic leadership.

""Best prepared"" list author also soul searching, ranking ""preparedness"" simply based existing ""medical knowledge/skill/equipment"" moronic. Local governments need ban Thanksgiving parties, dinners, gatherings.

These dinners kill lot people banned. don't. ignore either. Vaccines tuberculosis pretty successful 80's became drug resistant. Cases decline since 2005. Companies working new treatments. bill gates foundation donated towards it. Or, know, quarantining sick people, healthy ones. know Pakistan, Texas lol. New Zealand would like word. seem discounting fact stupid people make life difficult elves unnecessarily, pretty fix that, doors opened negate factor, stupid people fuck things time. thx think ugly ass easier someone knows theyr good fortune ends moment stop attractive Or, flying empty planes around country make look good.

Wouldn't put passed them. need Congress approve new stimulus, without political pork.

The Congress stop playing political games lives.  Sputnik need lady would died tried find bed would cause death heart attack stroke Covid-19? Early Covid survivor said one piece advice stay reddit. Boy, blow advice. admit think I'm getting numb all.

&amp;#x200B;

 \-Still lockdown Uh-oh, vaccine give us pandemic fatigue cause us return earlier behaviors unsafe pandemic.

I'm glad lots articles like coming out. suggest everyone read Declaration arguments making conclusions. come conclusion Fauci, fine, whatever. high time people stopped letting others think them.

The Declaration mainly argues favor focusing protection vulnerable populations making everything else voluntary others, essentially would lockdown elimination craziness taken over.

Remember, 2 weeks lockdown slow spread. became lockdown vaccine and/or elimination. talk locking vaccine, know elimination impossible.

The Declaration simply call refocus return reality. want world actually something contain virus live normal life. Lots countries done it. common denominator wealthy nations is: stupidity, laziness, short-sightedness selfishness.

In America especially, willingness believe complete BS science simply want to.

Your line argumentation makes sense play unless herd immunist. matter reinfection rare not, we're stupid enough try natural herd immunity.

But, look obvious facts, data, science anecdotes. Reinfection seems real concern natural herd immunity likely even possible.

But take excuses, lazy approach pandemic, unscientific approach virus, bound-to-fail approach fix economy take somewhere else. Everyone saying wear mask engage intentionally foolish behaviors. many times found trolls equating ""lockdowns"". Go troll political sub. suppose it’s developing countries it’s sight mind huh

Yes. thread specifically US. again, yes. even though we’re equally stupid.

Yes, are. ignorance mistakes get lot press attention compared Europe

Because summer months bit less dumb. everything reporting thing, sometimes reality different different locations different times.

If anything would argue Europeans way dumber, current numbers easy predict (and Angela Merkel example actually it) nothing.

But mean bad reporting summer USA wrong biased. accurate. bad reporting Europe now. ""just die"" acceptable outcome. Everyone reddit 25 year old, American, white, anglo-saxon atheist. know?

I'm going give thesis statements.

1.) US skipped entire expected period economic left, 35 years overdue.

2.) made society ridiculously poor, stupid.

3.) stupid democratic society choose best them.

4.) US's next step, regardless morally wanted, authoritarianism.

5.) Tea Party, establishment Republicans, establishment Democrats, Justice Democrats roughly agree above.

Each support well facts reasoning. But, there's another argument partially *disagrees*, valid factually, solid reasoning, moral. support argument, well. actually matter others agree one other. What's important others form factually sound, reasoned, moral opinions.

The question agree authoritarianism electorally inevitable. question is, going find believe?

Now, thing one tell you: learning world scale make happier otherwise? No. knew, do, sacrifice. Ignorance bliss. everyone learn? Definitely not. you? Idiocy millions dead herd immunity strategy

Are ""millions dead"" Sweden *their* herd immunity strategy? hear zodiac signs effect outcomes, too.

It's dangerous latch something simplistic blood type. many months, 6 months? people think might iffy inviting whole family Thanksgiving? already knew covid mutating slowly based expectations that.

You get covid multiple times, too, different reasons. seems (very?) rare caused insufficient immune responses [citation needed]. since vaccines focus parts need stay similar, give multiple shots. Nation's leaders great responsibilitiy role models. Let's say many people decide wear mask saw queen wearing one? Men, declare right here, wash hands, never date you. I'm pretty sure single women agree me. asking? worry, Belgium reached double amount per capita last week. still long way go. could PTSD, ""longhauler"". Shortness breath, fatigue...all classic PTSD sign. pomp around virus media, kid like gets it...some could fall psyche shock, PTSD. take recover even normal situations. situation...the stressor caused go away, news lockdowns masks and...

Maybe administered ecstasy drugs (MDMA?) saying helps military people recover PTSD.

I hope gets well soon. tho? I'm willing bet many people travel go family gatherings vacations making things much worse. Yet schools/offices/bars/restaurants still open. Stop messing around, shut down. else got. fun ust go on. inactivated virus &amp; recombinant vector vaccines, typically no. mRNA vaccines, sure. Good thing usually administer boosters every couple months. recombinant vector vaccines, trickier impossible. Obesity one biggest risk factor though. Yes people magically sudden change fuckheadded ways.  în România 300 daily cases lockdown. 4000 There’s certainly don’t understand yet. Blood type seems play role contributes small percentage variance patient outcomes. live society - dependent around us, us. pandemic reinforced this. actions affect others, take consideration. Breaking news: published Stanford study (John P Ioannidis ) finds infection fatality 0.2% Yes, except shield alone help. also know case history genome lineage originate there, like Spain 1918, ones tested and/or made results public.

The country proactive pandemic detection system definition find new global virus first, end trade off, either test end blamed finding first, test end 220k dead. seems people want risks reduced zero. get subsidies fully. NHSA already rejected suggestion submitted congress. Citing lack funds fully innoculate population. rule subsidies provided provincial government though, since NHSA only2 deals thr national level gonna panic? TIL people thought wearing face shields without masks would sufficient ""[Keep America also one them.

However could people midly sick people March tested like say. Probably appropriate method comparing peak case numbers, 2nd biggest outbreak contained China succeed. yeah absolutely one gonna follow Government still don’t give shit 50k cases day +1M 20 days.

See 3 weeks. tested 11 countries. Repost Lol! another upvote I'd say almost definitely March/April (40k day unlikely) still extremely high numbers country size. Yay positive. Repost blood type? would 100 million infections now, make difference outcome would require tens millions reinfections. getting R0 1. 1 1000 people getting reinfected cannot sustain transmission. *only* commenting parent comment seemed suggest number disastrously high.

Then read comment. answered wrong one?

From comment answered hey, anything late?

is 100% clear give away comment think 100 deaths catastrophe, deaths future. That's comments make sense. really wish people world would quit treating like teams sport tournament. First graph translation :

Or they're different strains.... cause different disease severity.... point, many accounts pushing narrative 2 weeks old?

Testing way better. early numbers real no.  problem understanding trends, 100 deaths/day worrying sign, way suggest trigger action authorities.

I \*only\* commenting parent comment seemed suggest number disastrously high. isn't, worrying sign coming disaster.

It's like sub thinks either must downplaying pandemic agenda, mus exaggerating agenda. Stop that. Assume people soberly looking numbers, statistically literate, trying either exaggerate downplay anything. say happening said

""400k cases day week **will mean**..."" saw Italy curve. [Even higher peak locked down, bit OT Trump gets another term Americans want go Canada supporters,maybe exchange program Canadians like Trump get U.S citizenship Americans want leave take places Nah, also different levels stupid. good numbers summer (in contrast you) got complacent.

You know, everything subjective attention thing. Sometimes reality different. case Europe good summer, fucked later. i’m swedish jew are, indeed, total colossal dick fingers. much COVID China vaccines really tested? mean, linked preprint article news article, papers showing thing. really see trying imply incorrect headline. even states article even sick 2nd time.

""The local patient wasn’t **as** sick second time around since recovered"" ""not even sick"". \~80% population stupid, everywhere. Perhaps less nordic countries. THANK you. average person doesn’t know difference doesn’t even represent million jews new york, let alone us world-over. So, never. might release defective vaccine rest world, dismiss possibility. there's way CCP give one people. would jeopardize everything achieved since Jan. would also doom China's recovering economy yeah, way they'd that.

I'm talking international reputation. CCP care that, cares internal reputation. Donating defective/less-than-stellar masks countries compromise CCP's standing people, reasoning remains perfectly valid. Also CCP cares virus eradication hollow reputation -- bc altruistic bc understand awful virus fucks economy. 

I've following pandemic since Jan Chinese data, esp claims Chinese doctors point. told us airborne transmission/asymptomatic transmission/CNS invasion/masks early Feb. thrombosis early March. Western scientists, contrast, claimed ""just flu"" months, denied airborne transmission, even refuse accept new information. bit rich question Chinese data consistently right course entire pandemic. Obviously dismiss Chinese data virus origins(aka lab leak) everything else better western counterparts. Like rest Europe thought opening borders middle pandemic good idea surprise nobody completely lost control situation. true, summer long. fucked taking serious more. 15/10/2020, Guangzhou Huadu District quarantine hotel staff underwent regular periodical test, one COVID-19 asymptomatic carrier discovered. Per epidemiological investigation patient determined related imported cases.

Mr Wong, 40 years old, Guangzhou Huadu District immigration quarantine hotel (Xinyuan Hotel) staff. Resides staff dorm hotel. Mr Wong undertook periodical test 05/10/2020 found negative. 15/10/2020 Guangzhou Huadu District ran another periodical test quarantine hotel staff Mr Wong found positive. sent Guangzhou No.8 People's Hospital quarantine medical observation. Currently showing symptoms. night Guangzhou Huadu District Pandemic Prevention Command Center initiated emergency procedures began epidemiological investigation. 68 close contacts quarantine, 66 tested negative PCR test, two still waiting results. Currently work way identify investigate places Mr Wong to.

A reminder citizens: please cooperate pandemic prevention efforts relevant agencies. Intensify personal protection, wear masks according scientific guidelines, wash hands often, ensure good ventilation maintain social distance. experience symptoms fever discomfort wear protective equipment, avoid public transports seek medical attention soon possible nearest fever clinic. Yeah, 2nd wave belgium hit right moment forming new government.

Our previous governements comminication shitshow, seem real communication whatsoever Anxiety real symptoms. Clinical anxiety manifests physically, people refuse treatment they're positive something ""real."" Hygiene theater. ""Late"" October Netherlands? hear already stop accepting patients cities, thankfully couple hours apparently. also requested ICU capacity Germany week ago. I'm sure really late October. missing point:

February: 100 deaths. know turned later.

Of course deaths delayed. People get COVID-19 first, die it. two week delay one shows symptoms often week long illness means see deaths month ago.

As cannot imagine someone understand spring already (autumn southern half globe), assume want spread misinformation. Please stop. purpose means *are* killing people. need vent, hate quarantine. hate away college. university probably isn’t gonna back person fall 2021 earliest. People need start looking one another.

It's outbreak waiting happen. Fatality Rate (23k / 1.7M = 1.4% IFR)
Actual Cases outcome May 1 = estimated actual recovered (1,671,351) + estimated actual deaths (23,430) = 1,694,781.

Infection Fatality Rate (IFR) = Deaths / Cases = 23,430 / 1,694,781 = 1.4% (1.4% people infected SARS-CoV-2 fatal outcome, 98.6% recover).

400000 x 7 x 1.4% = 39k (I 1.5)

Even number 1% 0.5% 10k people one week lot humans. racial one wasnt?? Hello?? Moderator?? global times et al propoganda outrageous still possible look past get level truths. 

Global Times worst day come close sheer level propaganda Western media spits out. say fully realizing Global Times tabloid meant taken media propoganda many ways worse subtle means many even realise exists. 

It worse every single measurable way. purposely misquote people, purposely mistranslate people saying, quotes complete nutjobs, purposely leaves critical information. worst circlejerk quoting ad nauseam gain ""credibility"". majority people realize happening shorter attention span goldfish can't make pass headline. 

Western propaganda best world. entity shits propaganda well Western media. media con multiple nations engage war crimes illegal invasions foreign countries multiple times still believe champions human rights? propaganda subtle, blatant. people seem suffer amnesia. LOOOOOL.

Fuck outta man. know believe Winnie Poo damn second.

US worst, actually  great explanation. currently ""governed"" party failed HIV epidemic 1980s. Forty years later mistakes, pure willful negligence. Much higher third world countries Africa though.   it. possible best testing. would OK federal law requiring mask wearing social distancing, along contact tracing rigorous testing, benchmarks opening re-closing. Kind like CDC initially requested, countries doing.

Unfortunately, happening USA.

I hope warmer weather coming soon provides relief! you’re able see friends family reopen safely. mad bruh? question wrong.

There virus kill thousands people per million ""inhabitants"" every year country.

There virus kill thousands people per million ""infected"" way higher (like ebola 500.000 deaths per million infected) kill well huge problems spreading. ebola outbreak 2014 managed kill 1 person right, infected 2 persons.

Flu example infect lots people. kill thousands per million infected, kills 100 million (0.1%) vaccines cannot infect whole country. 

Also medical system ready take care every single infected person. never heard ICUs full flu patients right? infects slow enough getting everyone sick time.

So fundamental knowledge, detailed answer question Issue COVID that:

1st can, (if allowed) infect population. (Not flu, vacines. Ebola kill infect anyone).
2nd way faster flu ebola (because contagious cannot provide decrease infectivity thanks vacine).
3rd mortality high enough troublesome proper medical care (1%)
4th mortality without proper medical care rises 10%. mortality get let everyone get infected time (So enough ICUs everyone).

Bonus COVID one serious illness spreads asymptomatic way. SARS MERS outbreaks 10-20% fatality rate proper medical conditions symptomatic persons infectious thus making way easier control.

2nd bonus: people (you) tend commit mistake believing COVID damage either death zero (you die perfectly fine) COVID seems cause persistence damage various forms even mild cases. returning Aussies, they'll gladly welcomed home two weeks quarantine :) old people long term care homes...wow failure! #whythefuckwould""thegovernment""inventapandemictoforcepeopleintonothavingsexwitheachother? good info, thank you. first thought is, fewer things purview Executive Branch better are. Titanic considered unsinkable There’s quite countries around world kept infections quite low long time. need strict lockdowns people stick modest restrictions next year so. America messed beyond belief. whole choice lives economy false choice. protect Well said mate. next level fuck us shit? wants come covid party?...

Anyone? need friend happens make policy without bottemless pockets federal government disposal. dumb. Basically walk lunch coworker wear mask outside, seated sit right next eat mask...what?? can’t 5 people backyard, wearing mask, eight people table bar?

I’m sorry it’s dumb ordinances/mandates like cause people take seriously. ""Almost inconveivable"" give break! unlike developed nations universal healthcare system here. result people reluctant use healthcare system even insurance deductibles, copays, etc. people reluctant leave workplace even sick fear losing job. failure OBVIOUSLY going be. post attempt humor I'm laughing. Trump Nah. I'm self isolating 14 days. You’re second-rate troll. pay attention mentioned skill mixes? even understand working nursing like? do. several countries.

Heck, even understand point? know Germany better health care US. husband German. I'm saying US bells whistles actually safe staffing. many job titles lot jobs they're delegating someone supposed supervised RN top everything else. NBA actually really interesting example medical responses protecting people saving lives, educate u/v8jet : &amp; 

And choose ignore S. Korea (a country millions, fewer deaths 43 STATES US have. reference, S. Korea 441 deaths, population 51 Million. 9 states fewer 400 deaths. rest 400, horrify US fucked every state except 9 them. Hawaii 185 deaths. done excellent job. that's listened medical experts since day one.), New Zealand followed pandemic response playbook US helped write 2015, Australia (a decent sized country), yes, Africa done well containing covid. Look stats compared US ;) 

Keep laughing, majority world gets enjoy schools, open businesses, sports (with fans), life without covid. 

It's truly sad fucked US is, horrible response is, idiots think covid running rampant somehow ok.

The US remain travel ban lists rest world, idiots like make excuses ongoing failed covid response here, people die get sick, US companies forced close, people lose jobs, get evicted, economy suffers. Really funny. Private health care means incentive help others pocket. Tens years making anti science tea party set groundwork Trump followed lead listened bull horn Fox News People get vaccinated spread flu.

And yet flu *still* kill 60,000 bad year. fact vaccines baked number. FFS, one risk discussions understand difference absolute relative safety.

If stood said December 2017 - ""We're track 60,000 flu deaths season, *have* shut bars indoor dining sake 10s thousands people going die (more children coronavirus). pushed cliff can't eat drink home""...you would said exactly? US’ response would better literally anyone else White House. doesn’t change fact nations (eg. small, rich, advanced countries collectivist cultures) likely better prepared.

Also...”you’re“. I’ve never quest get coronavirus thought “Please Trump come help get this.” Lol. It’s literally protect myself. one going me. think otherwise immature you’ll probably catch it. Prepared mass death maybe universal care supply chains designed fall apart needed cost efficient. Ah, swedish campaign too. Downvoting anything puts Sweden bad light - regardless true is.

Are guys getting paid nationalistic? Yeah, embarrassing. Dynasties rich kids cosplaying people importance Donald Trump got coronavirus. wants get too. Cool. Trump often cites beautiful great sources always right. 

My points aren’t study, fabric US difficulties woven DNA. Donald Trump. literally easy. whole response, lack of, stealing equipment believing hoax. name it. literally bungled every aspect it.  mean since seem answers would’ve better?You see people acted whenever told wasnt fucking dangerous people fighting fucking toilet paper shit.i imagine panic would’ve if.... Inb4 April 2021 rolls around saying ""July 2021. bet it!"" Well, deaths people preexisting conditions. People without preexisting conditions usually survive. dumb, malicious; malicious people everything intentionally. think saved millions lives what’s hundred thousand deaths people think would never voted anyway? trying justify nonsense OP, yourself? think he’s conservative. Robert Redfield said last month expects normal life resume Q3 2021. best preparation. Trump dismantled it.

FTFY or.. best prepared far, shows, potential best prepared, yet, chose priorities, like building giant wall. happens people think over...open cafes, allow casual things happen, lot stuff. we, humans, short attention spans Done! Sorry question? Trump+conservative oversight Flu kill 200,000+ 7 months.


People get vaccinated spread flu. Best prepared? joke?

FWIW I’m one Reddit’s faux-edgy “heh heh America bad pls upvote” people. It’s genuinely laughable say world’s third-largest country (that serious inequality/disparities health outcomes) better prepared small, wealthy island nations advanced countries collectivist cultures. Trump.

A moron charge Way hysterical completely miss point. saying everyone feels you, live free country.. smoking, drinking, hiv/aids, deadly.. see sweeping regulations individuals rights engage drinking death, unprotected sex, etc.... child labor anything personal behavior responsibility? Nice strawman arguement. middle ground.  Governement asks People travel.
King travels anyway.
Peasants stop listening governement.
Government: surpised pikachu face additional factor, flu shots 13% thus far we're already seeing flu.  may feel good think that, dad anti-Trump pro science got scammed anyway. Fake time share crap. Part just, seniors losing capacity proud admit it. German American?

What kind laws? Day 0: Exposure.

Day 1: 100% false negatives get test.

Day 2: people start become infectious.

Day 4-5: 67% risk false negatives, infectiousness peaks, symptoms usually onset around day 6.

Day 8: Test accuracy peaks, false negatives rate falls 20%. good tests get. gradually become less accurate again. 

Day 21: False positive rate increase 66%

The window infectiousness opens 2 days exposure close 11-19 days later, depending research read. Infectiousness peak day symptom onset day symptom onset. data mostly based people develop symptoms clear holds true people remain asymptomatic entire infection. accuracy nasopharyngeal swabs (the 'brain tickle'), nasal swabs reported less accurate.

Sorry revolutions bad track record really. someone thinks zodiac signs affect medical outcomes, think educate bit it’s pretty foolish thing say. Maybe sarcasm taking class, since dozen studies explain why. takes quick google school learn theory ridiculous. vaccine, general Eastern Europe countries hit hard hard spring, denialism even stronger elsewhere. Russia fact hit hard (the real death toll probably 600/M already, i.e. comparable Italy, counted something else) denialism still strong. 

The bigger factor weather.

In late August, based happened Southern hemisphere, new projections next months came out, catastrophic, appeared going strong seasonal component all. 

Which meant Russia one key countries watch seasonal effect, gets cold earlier elsewhere. indeed, cases deaths started rising early September really accelerated October. 

It help Russian cities basically like NYC -- densely packed reliant public transportation. 

Great sustainability livability, bad time pandemic. 

They probably still undercounting deaths factor 3-4, expect continue winter, would surprised April reached 0.5% PFR so. is, projections 110K+ deaths February based official numbers, reality probably already 90K deaths based excess mortality. Wow, mess around.

There's little seem understand. would useful sample death rate waves pandemic? That's logical equivalent building sandcastle approaching tide.

Deaths lag significantly behind cases. Cases low weeks lockdown reduced spread absolute number cases. So, months lower numbers. back 4 weeks covid deaths dwarf causes?

Try reading sun. *don't* power, that's thing. egregiously ""overstaying welcome"" pursue nakedly political personal-to-turmp ends. never need specific laws policy stuff administration gave shits anything else whims one guy top it.

Well there's answer. CDC known truly best world. credibility shot though fault own. Yes made mistakes early on, sabotaged people care reputation all. Without good reputation, thousands future lives lost people continue believe conspiracy theories destroy CDC credibility.

There studies showing significant spread airplanes. live fear virus *still* rely speculative fear justify think travel.

It's always doubt, ""what if"", ""we know"". Well, knowing stop undertaking socially economically devastating public health program human history, it?

Rational people rely data evidence. simply evidence COVID spreads well airplane. Infections 20%. Hospitalizations major cities. TV news already calling deadly new phase pandemic 3rd peak.

It’s looking like we’re going SOMETHING winter slow spread, yes means lockdowns. correlation causation, vitamin previously implicated pretty much everything, turn later helpful. younger, father gave advice never forget.

“Scott,” said “when somebody tells want help figure evidence base behind different supplements, ask Vitamin D. say it’s useful anything besides bone health, run away.”""

To fair Vitamin D, evidence role preventing respiratory illnesses little stronger evidence effect cancer, etc. generally speaking, vitamin studies, people lower vitamin levels worse outcomes, put supplements, continue worse outcomes. normally factors causing low vitamin levels poor outcome, normally vitamin deficiency problem. said, Vitamin harmless supplement worth trying. Well hasn’t right anything yet- still listening ?  sounds like logic thing point - still don’t know anyone - I’m world time - time give control back people - dr wrong everything  Actually US didn’t throw enough money problem. Pandemic budget cut enough money invested health care.

A lot money needed thrown rich instead given many opportunities hoard themselves. working together. Purposely sabotaged. ... couple months...

Bru PA since March, that's like 8 months, thats little couple.  Can't rush science, think can/should science literate. standard 2-14 days exposure. However, always outliers, atypical situations...if exposed brought home caught directly viral particles clothing skin, friend took longer show symptoms actually passed infection along diagnosis made. standard metrics, would extremely contagious contact guys Monday, would definitely err side caution assume making sick, honestly, one infected household member, isolation anyway, would monitor carefully unless need test peace mind underlying conditions raise risk level family. CDC really best world, sidelined best kneecapped worst. care Redfield, scientists, doctors, epidemiologists world class. terrible happened them.

Yes made mistakes beginning seriously, suffocated executive branch whole time. I'm devastated see much power branch literally sabotage every institution possible. Literally exact thing happened Obama, Biden, HRC President 90% happened. Deaths would probably 50k instead 215k Riiiii-coooo-viiid Well I’m fucked. Can’t wear nice cloth masks work, wear issued paper ones. nose wire super weak it’s impossible get good seal, readjust every couple minutes :/ Still leaves timeline experts expect. EUA November/December, mass distribution starting February/March. months y’all, dont schools proper ventilation? 10 days since symptoms started longer fever, infectious more. might still test positive, swabs pick dead viral material body shedding, live virus. Surely talking weekly totals, 800 per day apocalyptic. bunch crap. case contagious thing allegedly alleged a/pre-symptomatic transfer would already huge outbreaks gyms given conditions instead ONE incidence. Hundreds gyms across province, one spin class gets outbreak end world... close gyms!!! Rona gym, rona grocery store, rona bed. gotten sick year... nothing. Know one single person rona... keep asking around ""hey know anybody rona?""... nobody knows anyone rona. Yet apparently everywhere nowhere. Entire thing stinks. mean mandatory vaccination no? sporting events expendable, *ever* viruses kill tens thousands people *every year* circulating? China also become biggest film market year. Right, [six worth distancing can't people admit protests horrible optics pandemic? Ok havoc

In *but* clinical terms.  Maybe I'm misunderstanding you, days start getting shorter June. equinox already half-way shortest day year. unblind absolutely (toxicity, like case, tested positive, may need unblind)  milwaukee here, people compliant masks stores anyways. I'm sure rest state though numbers lie. what, who? morning, Qingdao held press conference report latest progress COVID19 outbreak situation .

Ma Lixin, head Center Disease Control prevention Shandong Province, said comprehensive field epidemiological investigation,big data investigation laboratory test results analysis national provincial joint expert group ,   determined outbreak caused infectious patients Qingdao port shared CT room patients common ward hospitalization, community transmission .


More details: surveillance video showed 2 patients left isolating inpatient ward  got CT scanned quarantined(asymptomatic time),and CT room disinfected properly, therefore 2 patients got CT scanned next day infected. timelines remain close enough people think worth long enough away people ok two months timeline pushed back 

Even making progress, disease endemic probably stay. Every month spent researching vaccine another month virus could evolving splitting different strains. fucking saw coming walking hand hand darkness well... actually, cases don... nevermind see out! daft? Apparently idea authority President regarding states do. Stop talking ass. Impatience. Wait another 6 months 2 years? Every week, every study contradicts last. politicized. thing know sure, one trusted... Certainly DoD. needs known. work airline worry I'm going laid day  Great... want deadlift 600 lbs. get covid recover first time? And? Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* #1!!!!! Hand washing good sewage/waste management saves lives! comments meaningless garbage. Nazis killed 6 million Jews another 30 million Eastern Europe. 

The COVID death toll order too. 

And entirely preventable.

What regular people ""want"" independent variable -- product massive propaganda campaign organized people responsible stopping virus. 

And people would wanted something different honestly told truth, told needs done eliminate virus, properly taken care duration effort. done group people. realize US nearly size Europe? japan work visa pending year really wanted leave election jobs open due pandemic opening positions( sounds bit morbid sorry) think Biden wins, restore CDC quickly. I'm expecting smooth transition, tap people prior Obama administration right CDC ship. could had...🤦‍♂️. meantime, significant percentage Americans busy pushing idea there's nothing humanity virus, may well let everyone get infected. job require no/little training would argue it’s “skill” step 1. find sand.

step 2. purify massive amounts electricity heat past 2000c.

step 3. melt molten use crystal seed crystal growth.

step 4. ~~profit~~ cut polish wafers.

step 5. use chemical processing alkaline, acids UV light etch sketch desired pattern.

step 6. teach maths.

step 7. teach logic.

step 8. ~~teach think~~ wait circumstances teach sand thinkkkkkkkkk OHHHH MYYYY GGOODD RRRUUUUNNNN!\~!!!!!! ""I wish *had taken..."", ""would have"". 24.1%. Read. Yesterday stats,

USA - 66,129 cases, 874 deaths

India - 60,439 cases, 835 deaths

Interesting see quite similar. , Viet Nam ? regret first can't go back home ? still financial okay right ? feel you. It’s Americans conditioned birth consumers. must repeatedly marketed to, seeing message dozen times ready buy. Reuters owes world duty market common sense America. know family's health profiles, rather healthy... I'd chance properly quarantine two weeks before. cannot control what's going facility, control do. needed stay put pick grandma two weeks later, I'd it. I'm also relatively healthy, young person I'm even vaccine trial know I've immunized. I'd willing gamble grandma passing me, vice versa. ""Many"" meaningless term. It’s almost like sub made different individuals varying opinions get pick choose whose opinion like don’t like. November fun Murcia lol 


Them polls gonna nasty yuck literally millions way how.... going happen. 2 provinces disproportionate number cases compared populations provinces. Ontario Quebec infection rates do, fact, compare closely US figures provinces do. 200 people aged 19 younger died coronavirus US. Unless 2,000,000,000 kids infected US, think doctors may mistaken chances happening. clearly never happened.. Dude, even controversial anecdote. We're getting studies show many persistent symptoms least 3 Wow talk chance avoiding getting exposed.
Also hell get public? media gets best views clicks doom gloom panic.

With deadlier strains virus hopefully getting wiped less lethal strains slowly coming down, pandemic theoretically continue fall towards 0, good. 

The media instead chooses ignore try terrify people. gets clicks, sells, gets views. media sad, terrible state right now. MSNBC FOX CNN, messed up. upside able focus resources better fewer people sound like bad thing. 

Especially since position simply need hoards unskilled labor anymore. believe know probably assume anything. likely IMO different mechanisms might give result (not seroconverting asymptomatic case first round, building t-cells properly severe case).

We've seen examples confirmed reinfection cases ""moderate"", resulted seroconversion. We've also got anecdote (if give credence) lower thread friend friend sick twice tested positive antibodies between. know t-cells may important immunity (certainly long term immunity) antibodies (because antibodies fairly short half-life).

Many, perhaps all, confirmed reinfection cases people pretty substantial immune issues, btw. actually case studies individuals.

The worrisome possibility way COVID infect T-cells directly preventing people ever mounting correct immune That’s quite reach. don’t agree making school work mandatory pandemic, hardly think rises level Holocaust. probably one put jail it.

If ask people, 99% actually *want* go work put kids school. hated lockdown. working part, socializing &amp; take care kids part. 
All coworkers talk scared getting locked kids again. 

Who knew people keen stay away family &amp; waste life away office? seem totally missed point... 259 THOUSAND people. 

Look crime rate city 250K plus people. *Herd immunity, heard immunity. bad schools Europe? Could stronger mutation scared of. ....I fucking hope not. Please please please one two maybe Joseph Smith? ton body weight stuff. In-demand.... doesnt pay well.... maybe demand? 8 million cases US.

Confirmed cases. actually believe that's totality cases, you? actually believe You’re fucking High think we’re even sniffing herd immunity next 12+ months.

Well work one major vaccine manufacturers, pulse situation. vaccine, US absolutely achieve herd immunity 12 months. Local school superintendent IL said spreading school kids sick. Except kids less likely symptomatic found positive easily spread kid kid home. least that's theory.  build... privacy hedge! let ask politely. cannot expect young healthy, near zero risk death covid, put lives hold indefinitely. majority healthy people gave government death-vulnerable 6 months prepare protection plan vulnerable. government basically nothing, point vulnerable protect themselves. 

forcing young put lives hold indefinitely productive years cruel. 8 million cases US. many people live here, like 350 mil? 


You’re fucking High think we’re even sniffing herd immunity next 12+ months. 


Lmao really fucking idea you’re talking dude. agree &amp; know fact. America lately become cesspool nonsense opinion. Everyone worried everyone else doing. mean yeah that’s is. could one world government distributed populations production that’s long ways IMO good leadership global cooperation, overcome

That correct.

It also means absolutely fucked think really starts [lying usefulness 1 minute video shows. Feb 7th meeting CDC, *chose* ramp mask supplies, instead decided could change mask wearing guidelines event mask shortage developed.    

I recognized advice got end Feb early March deliberate lie.  agency propensity lie, agencies available countries ─ CDC made agency relied on. big planet, we're country health agencies. really, we're closer herd immunity start pandemic. Herd immunity something like 40% immunity. 1.5 million Christmas. still mean mutation occurs makes let become less lethal transmissible. develop transmissible traits get far, there's still chance becomes less lethal. Lol like redditor would gf It’s early think herd immunity point. see new one literally almost every single day. hate reinfection rare. know is. every time someone says is, feel like mindlessly say wrong.

Do like staying indoors? I'm genuinely asking. want? accept sometimes get lucky? former Wade-Giles romanization 青岛 Qingdao ,check famous Tsingtao Beer  reinfection indicate immune system fully develop long term antibodies specific covid-19 body able fight off, wrong assume information. like 9/11 survivors national/global scale. Chronicly ill people getting marginalized politically convenient ignore scale failure protect people want deny long-term effects virus? would anyone want information? going Covid till cows come home. :( judge whole trump administration actions pandemic nothing else. done nothing try kill people this. ESPECIALLY people get go rallies. eventually end. countries soon others. It’s “taking away rights.” Definitely go Edinburgh! hike Arthur’s Seat great way spend morning. love Greyfriad’s Kirkyard (cemetery) city. Lots history, spooky macabre like sort thing. train ride gorgeous, especially May. canola plants blooming them, countryside filled rolling fields yellow flowers. Highlands also amazing. recommend trip Inverness time go far north. Scotland incredible me. wish could live there! honestly quick enough. Ok, think could die catching beating first time around. That's crazy. sorry family. I'm sure big deal media making be, like Houston summer means Hope must passed know intimate setting. Way completely miss point. He’s saying go restaurant wear mask doesn’t really matter take eat anyway, thus increasing risk. Wash hands, keep distance, can't, breathe... complicated. Yes actually do. Wow, small town Wisconsin many new infections yesterday one bar. CEO stated apply EUA soon get safety milestone 3rd week November.

The 3rd week november actually 15-21 wouldnt say late november. Watch Kansas City Chiefs football game see head coach wearing face shield instead mask. Czechs american fuck regard lock country 95+% survival rate ludicrous. 

How deal hospital situation then? infectious disease hard contain even hospitals. Yo made spinach cheese beef roulade time used tea tree oil toothpicks hold together cooked whole thing disturbingly minty “All animals equal, animals equal others” George Orwell Animal Farm think curb house parties usually happen night. IMHO, indoor dining probably completely banned serious impact decreasing positive cases. Let's face it, restaurants probably still going packed lunch time, especially since French gov subsidizes worker's lunches dining out. Youth equal immunity.

Best fried mine, 16 year old niece running high school track. Typical afternoon practice, fifty yards run collapsed died right track lane. Autopsy revealed super rare heart condition family never knew about. 

These kids get COVID undetected comorbidities. I'd rather err side caution distance, wear mask, practice good hygiene rather risk inadvertently causing one die. Norway done really great job keeping virus bay. really hope continue so. Social distancing yodelers...my new book spring... Wise guy huh contrary, looking country best (Vietnam?, New Zealand?) start emulating soon possible.

But get mean, seems like people taking pride worst. lot self reported reinfections

Which zero faith in. dumb be? tell whatever want you’re blue face. Covid laughable anymore. numbers aren’t reported right, 40% testing isn’t accurate, CDC changes like wind. go on. concept, paywall subscription needed apparently.

I'd say EXCELLENT news boys girls, fingers crossed. Push second wave early stages COVID Vaccine era. Interesting. mom telling lot siblings exposed work spouses got almost one family catching it. American here. father, 84 less, barber. He's getting younger customers usual. older regulars seen since March. think aged people staying home may account lower death rate. Remember Lord Fauci said masks don’t work? do, literally watched say 20/20. Like seriously, still trusting guy? Asking real questions here. Oh quite them. group mesh mask people. want argue wearing face covering. don’t actually care kill anyone. Smart people made plan. Dumb people ruined it. think kind fun talk around bot. Like... plan boat Persimmon Turnip, former voice persimmon Cho B'dan? (Sounds like ambassador star trek).  essentially immaculate infection? airlines require masks. let's hope continues like that. Anything else would mean death many Norwegians, nobody wants that. soon 3rd week november, looking calendar year could mean November 15th- November 21st.


I know lot people wanted election, let's real, November 15th literally less 2 weeks later people hoping, insanely quick. weren’t news networks crying it? banking vaccine covid

It problem here.

Are news networks ignoring places TB problem? know answer suspect either. 

... even news networks places TB big problem? sure, EU collectively almost much dead US lot underreporting. 

I live Belgium assure disaster. 
Testing labs backing up. Hospitals overflowing. 

And government refuses lockdown close schools.

We weeks away surpassing number daily dead first wave. I've never seen professionals using one alone, regular people since pandemic started? Oh yeah. Humanity really self-destructive path. humans acting best interest humanity whole? seems like one best life goals could have! instead death cults knowingly spread dangerous misinformation. sad US turn Covid issue political tool.

Damn, 2 previous Presidents (Bush &amp; Obama) even already completed pandemic playbook follow, playbook coronavirus mentioned. tests harder homeschoolers. That's law. 

Neither government gave data it. Opposers propose separatism he's talking exist since homeschooling supervised tested. would rich euro time heard words didn’t age well. 

Curious Russia funding W Europe death cults, propaganda, disinformation like done United States? It'd help people stopped saying ""europe"" EU shitting bed. understand argument, part benefits gym’s heavier weights always push towards new goal, big motivator people exercise. lot establishing exercise routine mental, all. Since know obesity one biggest risk factors COVID complications death, might worth people take risks keep active. get 8 plates. least 6 countries SE asia point people please think larger audience creating title care country SE asia post dont want investigate What's point curfew closing restaurants (earlier) everyone going gather &amp; infect others restaurants another time day? like virus less infectious still light outside. wife discussing this. get extremely small turkey breast I'll Cajun fry. Twice baked potatoes, marinated vegetables, apple pie. evening lot good wine perhaps even cigars patio deck area. Right? almost like handing government people believe government bad idea. Definitely conversation I'm looking forward mom. I've looking, I'm willing spend 3x much normally would used weights. Amazon... Ok, I'll try explain you, since guess reading link. 

When someone dies virus, often die effects virus like pneumonia heart damage stroke. 

When someone dies HIV, example, die something takes advantage weakened immune system caused HIV. mean still die HIV. 

When COVID-19 kills someone, number different ways (pneumonia, organ damage, strokes, etc). happens doctor puts ""COVID-19 stoke"" ont death certificate. 

Here, ""6%"", that's person died COVID, doctor failed put something like stroke pnumonia. simply failure identify exact way covid killed person. 94%, doctor determine covid killed them. Evangelical Christians. That's how. used word repost posted. Appalachian State student story.  good finding someone low-level blame problem. cases supposed stay State secrets. Stop spamming comment, plewse. What? greenish brown. Although yeah maybe toys towards Terra cotta color. Anyway see Jabba Covid, long long time ago far far away “Within scope test, results showed overall low exposure risk aerosolized pathogens like covid-19 aircraft,” said Vice Adm. Dee Mewbourne, deputy commander U.S. Transportation Command.
Significantly, study examine risk posed virus spreading larger droplets people spread eating talking. look risks involved getting airport waiting board plane. Still bad country. Thanks irresponsible orange... 1) masks means social distancing. Masks without staying 6 ft apart don’t really accomplish much. live world must always view others threat.
 
2) don’t like face covered shave faces covered. isn’t normal, it’s dystopian depressing. Careful overstate - Canadian study came past days specifically said enough info latch onto yet. said would need observed various locations across time and, right now, abundance studies corroborating it.

Doesn't mean useful info worth pursuing, get twisted. expensive gym membership motivation problems that's you. lol Yes, would emerge, even anecdotally What’s crazy since posted we’ve already gone 13% more: 18,117 20,933. that’s counting whatever post today. 

About 40% cases **since March** last 21 days. Idiots. Seriously! 

Große Freiheit Hamburg last night packed like New Year’s Eve. 

We’re probably going get infected supermarket whatever punks lack basic human decency. confirm. Georgia moment people living like 85% normal. 6 months, tend drown chicken littles convinced going DIEEEEE moment. I'm sorry probably right. takes lot creativity pivot get needs met different circumstances absolutely right people can't figure one lousy year. also factor estimates seem think upwards five times many people infected we've caught confirmed. would cut number deaths factor five.

Which lot death hopefully better ways around it... 8.85 million Americans would die Covid even 100% us caught it. ""Grim record 132""

Sounds like onion headline meant shit United States Link's right now?

Assuming meant ""links"", look Amazon lazy fuck? Exactly point...no one seems willing adjust daily habits help decrease cases. one would stuck work employers would encourage telework asked do, obviously enforced. Folks winner! person sarcastic, think blood types influence. That’s part focusing on, zodiac bit. preexisting condition? community ? misunderstanding CDC report reference. Trump happened. Never liked them. Studio recordings sound better come without crowds dirty toilets. looks bad, Bob. Real bad. elected officials incompetent basically elected life care nothing people represent, concern power wealth. Term limits fix get rid lobbyists groups keep funneling cash elected leaders 7705 new infections reported, positivity rate 15% 


good website gathering Polish covid data: amount cases state magically money support lay-offs like March/April. Presumably yes, there's much chance we're going see per capita cases level US. Because, among things, government actually gives shit problem. Eyyyyyyyy Well really enforce would realize it’s crazy open 6

Who's gonna take dinner 6 ? People still work. way early average french considered different store? could order right wanted. puts us what, seat #8 deadliest pandemic last thousand years? literally murder. Call negligence deaths want, calling murder makes look like fool. it? Ive lost 4 family members virus. know hundreds people small community. somebody think rich southern California homeowners - might pay decent wages nannies lawn care! Oh yeah, I’m means saying bars remain open. 

But far mental health goes, don’t need gym fancy setup get workout. you’ve got flat piece ground, push-ups, sit-ups, planks, burpees, squats, lunges, yoga, etc. also find good run pretty easily. really need weights make cheap ones coffee cans concrete, improvise start squatting bags whatever heavy stuff you’ve got around house. 

It’s favorite way work out. much prefer getting gym. pandemic response can’t centered around still favorite things still effective possible. feel like like black plague eliminate 1/3rd population. guy you’re replying third year undergrad lol. Well definition ""intenionally foolsih behavior"" includes lot normal aspects life make worth living. since insist via executive fiat, political issue. article helps explain fall Many feared left spoke out, White House would stop consulting CDC all, would push even dangerous seen apolitical bulwark, CDC endured meddling multiple fronts officials little public health experience, Trump’s daughter Ivanka ...

*(D^*!!!:(

Ivanka Trump NEVER telling scientists must tell/not tell Old habits die hard. Part due testing shit definitely hitting fan government refuses lock close schools.
10448 reported today 49 dead.

2 weeks ago 2000 3000 daily cases 1-2% tested positive die.

In 2 weeks expect 200 die single day. bad worst first wave lockdown. Trump reddit would someone cherry pick two random stats, base everything those, call actual professional study flawed comparison. lmao. People say that, 3 weeks later change minds numbers double again. particular area UK live \~350 cases (that know of) per 7200 people week something like 1-2 weeks ago. sitting around 180. Thank long ineffective federal leadership, numbers continue grow. quantity vaccine already manufactured, ready ship. makes sense plan ready vaccinating first responders soon vaccine approved. required get part employment. Breakdown regions. TLDR: Yes, everywhere, first lockdown northern regions badly probably strictest lockdown Western world March/April, worked! Things gradually reopened starting May, without cases going all.

There smallish spike end summer, mostly caused people returning holidays abroad. Since weeks, things growing exponentially again, jury's still reason. blame school reopenings.  Money Yep. One coworkers constant fret status cabin hills. might find weekend. greatest generation. really hard difference dying Covid dying Covid complications? replied directly reply me! 😊 • Currently positive: 107.312

• Deaths: 36.427 (+55, +0,15%)

• Recovered: 247.872 (+1.908, +0,78%)

• Hospitalized: 6.816 (+434)

• ICU.: 638 (+52)

• Tests: 13.322.204 (+150.377)

A chart summarizing % positive people different EU countries nation, government divided: majority students would like follow school home, one region ""Campania"", Naples is, already closed schools universities obviously caused disruption, made % positives high can't make many tests; parents want kids home work government trying save face insisted reopen schools (with support teachers others) spent much give impression schools secure say vital students go school online learning thing.

Another big problem public transportation overwhelmed there's distance bus, metro trains.

In moment government still thinking new restrictions many protests ongoing cities Campania Lombardia hard lockdown apparently. Milan alone yesterday 1000 positives. unlikely though see national lockdown Christmas time.

Tests facilities already overwhelmed two weeks ago. One word: Trump wrong lethality. far looks like 2% 7 US. herd immunity threshold estimate generous since one knows threshold herd immunity is. Epidemiologists trying model exact thing right now. It’s probably going higher 80%. 

My entire point herd immunity requires huge death toll. I’m curious levels education Germany. seems large percentage Americans either didn’t complete high school complete didn’t actually learn anything. Ayyy shout Cameron peak Mullen fires apocalyptic air quality! talking guy ? 

I'm arguing refuting saying can't tell one us talking key wounds self-inflicted. Records obtained ProPublica detail first time cataclysmic chain mistakes disputes inside CDC labs making first U.S. test COVID-19. respected lab scientist made fateful decision use process risked contamination, saw signs trouble, sent tests public health labs anyway. Many tests didn’t work, scramble fix serious CDC blame, Trump administration exploited events take control agency’s messaging. historically lethal pandemic raged, White House turned CDC political bludgeon advance Trump’s agenda, alternately blocking agency’s leaders using quarantine powers forcing assert powers objections CDC scientists. best plan meaningless followed. No, number infections order magnitude higher. would 80 million Americans. I'm specialist either. numbers Wikipedia. far tell true death total COVID-19 already higher reported 1.1M soon eclipse many epidemics/pandemics listed.

Edit; reading original comment stated rated much authority have, sorry that.  rest nation better. constant fixation FL? prepared ass. I’m sick right now, people need hug? 🤗 right, lockdown important, mindset early moves, Vietnamese government people believe risk act upon right beginning.

The people actually act way Government, wear mask, practice social distancing, report possible cases etc. Government committed 100% full blown lockdown + case tracing new case.

We KNOW resource healthcare system fragile, underinvested able handle pandemic act like life depend right beginning, Government people.

The Government give clear instruction, taking shit opposition populace buy in, highly confident acting together get this. complained government shutdown sources fake news social medias (quite popped early phase face heavy fine).

Our heavy distrust China also play advantage, know neighbor well enough detect bullshit happen. agree better use use masks correctly doesnt side effects. 

There doubt masks works professionells use them. public health behavioral science much epidemiology. 

This guesses Sweden hasnt yet recomended masks. 

1) tested 3 times covid drive in/bike thing. People taking tests changes mask washes hands every person. 30 people per hour i.e 30 mask changes per hour. Even though never come closer 1,5 m. 

At time amateurs use mask days, doesnt wash hand touching mask, sharing masks etc.

2) reason might risk people use masks efficiently limited time. enforce mask use might harder make people use really needed.(cases fairly low right - although increasing) 

3) third might risk assesment. Lots research done bicykle helmets example. people drive cars signs see bicyklist wearing helmet drive closer. overestimate protection helmet gives. 

The could true masks.

Personally believe number 2 important reason. Summer coming. worked  Shutting borders worked March reality, virus never contained started infecting slowly borders opened up. long ago. anything else happening November? 

Things make go ""Mmmm"" next history CDC written, 2020 emerge perhaps darkest chapter 74 years, rivaled involvement infamous Tuskegee experiment, federal doctors withheld medicine poor Black men syphilis, tracked descent blindness, insanity CDC staff describe waging battles much protecting science White House protecting public COVID-19. war have, often not, spoke openly “hill die on” — political interference would prompt leave. Yet again, surrendered told. wasn’t worries paying mortgages forfeiting prestige job. Many feared left spoke out, White House would stop consulting CDC all, would push even dangerous veteran scientists, acquiescence real sign CDC lost way. One scientist swore repeatedly interview said, “The cowardice caving disgusting me.” consider vaccine ""safe""? 

A safe vaccine typically takes [about 5 years create unsafe vaccine irreparable harm.

And want us line shot 6 months?

All relatives bet USA would come covid without problem Republican Underestimated 'Muricas Problems. That's really stupid question. didn’t mention politics post.

Why'd dig Fox News CNN others think Covid overstated: whatever, you. stay away loved ones please. also suggest visit hospital talk ICU doc nurse.

Its ""thinking"" ""feeling"" anything dude. That's science works, data works. reality.

Pretty funny people scream ""follow science!!!"" past 8 months ones distorted perception. Maybe follow numbers instead Chris Cuomo? thought. Additional information:

222 new deaths reported. don’t get getting downvoted, struggle believe anything US government Chinese government say Winter coming 210k US deaths divided 8 million cases = 2.6%, closer. admit playing fast loose 7% 80% pulled ass ONE KNOWS HERD IMMUNITY THRESHOLD SARS2 is. saying hold political rally thousands people? Or...what? I'm guess guys ready sarcasm yet...but kids gonna love it.

Should hold racially charged protests around country instead weeks, organized popular alpha bet people groups?  Downvoted truth. spot on. next weekday is. understand clinical trial is? Trump Greed Oppression Pollution GOP state supreme court took away GOP dominated state legislators laughed.

Gerrymandering works. hope people voting attitude. mean it’s still really bad Nightly roaming bands antifa spreading disease DAs unwilling arrest Yep. people selfish dangerous ""Best prepared"" according whom? Without sick population, living poverty, substantial percentage access medical care, eating crappy processed foods high fat sugar, decimated public health system.... Hope pouting advance. Hope faith's richer, bitchier sister. Hope deformed addict bound incest monster offspring entitlement fear. FDA run political appointees.

Congress role, far tell, approval drugs. Regardless, session mid-November mid-January. Texas pretty diverse 41% white, 35% Hispanic, 11% black. Sizable chunk populations speak languages four sides English. Christian also got pretty fast growing population religions atheists. 

You know America's one least homogeneous nations earth right? Hope pouting advance. Hope faith's richer, bitchier sister. Hope deformed addict bound incest monster offspring entitlement fear. UCs good job. UCR even giving people laptops need remote study.

It's nice California despite screeching right. apocalyptic hard truth experiencing apocalypse thise died already end. tge survivors far include non-Western candidates, already are. actually said 50 million doses would available front-line vulnerable people November. Well fair, Electoral College allowed businessman/TV show personality political experience take highest form office even though lost popular vote. started appointing people qualified opposing interests positions authority. 

So, yeah, I'd say trust government time low. I've never really firmly stated political stance, trusted government fuck things like administration fucked things up. 

In spite historically-neutral political stance, administration pushed trust corruption Democratic party erode country/culture/health/etc like least less harmful corruption Republican party. 

I concede US trust government probably continued slide since politics become shitshow since 9/11. healthcare workers, doctors, nurses, EMT, cops, teachers exposed daily people covid infected die increasing numbers. Hope pouting advance. Hope faith's richer, bitchier sister. Hope deformed addict bound incest monster offspring entitlement fear. hope. He's hoping death misery. Even mist March, covid outbreak point prison province leading 207 cases infection. nevertheless traced back exactly 1 source infection whole chain officials provincial justice department party secretary provincial correctional department party secretary warden prison commissar 3 vice-wardens, everyone dismissed investigated.

Article title could read, ""Pfizer says seek vaccine authorization early mid-November"". know? It‘s governmental agencies approve vaccine. One interesting consequence pandemic might actually saved lives killed - worldwide, general.

The behavioral changes we've seen far drastically cut rate flu almost ZERO southern hemisphere.  likely happening number contagious diseases.

...and behavioral changes persist, even partially, may see enduring benefits years come - saving far lives covid took. live Michigan, I'm guessing people (including myself) can't access story. Fortunately, health department, least now, authority issue mask mandates restrictions. I'm guessing surge inevitable, probably inevitable everywhere. Hopefully Michigan still stays relatively decent side things. Firstly, referred entire country ‘we’. speak - don’t speak turn.

Secondly, one actually thinks US ‘leader free world’ - that’s bullshit piece marketing US bestowed upon itself. That’s issue. US proven time time 3rd world country. system government that’s corruptable it’s even democracy (and say ‘it’s republic’, don’t care).

Everything comments selfish inaccurate, mention painfully naive. stop go something else. question real question Listening people internet pretend credentials real epidemic. Next time try listing Facebook source want believed. 

But seriously, every science I've read says soap dissolve fatty container. destroy RNA (PCR would still give positive) would kill already relatively small ability infect via fomites. wrong? me, seems like Republicans say nothing done lot issues want deal with. say there's nothing stop climate change say hard move clean energy. also say nothing done mass shootings, even though US developed country mass shootings regularly. Whatever happened can-do attitude US cold war. Hell, America went moon less 10 years. smiles/laughter days. mask game never mandated rest lives. Reminder: Two seats election MI Supreme Court year. like outcome, vote. skip judge section. Abstract (translated):

Question here, 

My GF’s friend gathering ~20 people house Halloween feel bit uncomfortable going. little cases town people one friend group know aren’t stupid taking precautions situation people trust. can’t get past fact go small chance get it, it’s went party pandemic. feel split do, maybe conflicted I’m proud admit. add one pressuring go. Seems like maybe cut dry don’t go guys think?  US run fucking moron nobody balls stand get office holds. US top 3 Western world mask adoption since April according YouGov polling (only consistently behind Italy Spain).

The idea Americans wear masks grounded reality. first two words title answers question. bars young people giving shit, business schools put profit structure ahead peoples lives. dam obvious  Nah, people ignoring pretty much since beginning. guess got lucky summer break reason. Plus schools open ‘in-person’. Kids attending classes together (no masks). article talks one risk factors US.  almost like people happy live, work, purchase, pay taxes, state progressive policies. Thanks quick answer! Hahah could.. I’d much prefer falls cliff somewhere. She’s fucking moron, saying election happens virus go away wins. can’t handle level stupidity. It’s hard health hands total idiots. Yeah, young people get least benefit harm covid restrictions. old people, it’s reverse. Old people people power, needs made higher priority. Loooll watched big short end Steve Carell says “ they’ll blame poor people immigrants, like always do” reference crash. 

Oh times stay same. Could anybody predicted massive right wing media resistance happened? total ""trump"" card game cancelled preparedness country may had.  ""illegals"" likely ones making fat-fuck treats restaurants brags going to.. causes literally every modern pandemic lol Lol.. Trump entered chat lolwa bhenchod.... Good. He's one public health officials emerge integrity. Birx rest clique need sacking regardless credentials putting personal gains public health.

“I’m kic^king ass!” Canadian residential schools considered genocide, pretty apt comparison. Trial ‘approved’ vaccine still ongoing. limited amount vaccine available medical personnel. limited mean number thousands even. Vaccination general population happening initially going happen vaccine fully approved promised happen time early 2021. (I currently Russia) safe relative person. age comorbidity level virus kills 10% chance chance catching covid next year 50%, i'd say virus kills less 5% time would ""safe"" know numbers exaggerated, risk profile someone 95 years old deciding whether take vaccine different whether 5 year old should. Misinformation, bad leadership, selfish citizens Well four days ago Covid-positive president came out, dramatically removed mask front cheering crowd proclaimed wasn’t big deal like eight hundredth time national television tell me. that, Biden wins, actually become President Jan 20th. I'm referring areas wear them. Obviously people comply enter building, part. know health care workers going work knowingly covid exposing people anyways quarantining. see packed malls restaurant parking lots w people eating w masks cares. Insane. use logic, universities said masks helps protect you, received funding research masks people makes them. need research done, pay universities that. Therefore, can't trust science masks either? Always has, always right? mean, argument masks thing exception, strong argument really? try debate merits stance Great Barrington Declaration giving. Almost??? info regions suffered badly spring hit now? *“Theres fucking plan deal situation like this”*

Spoiler alert... **was**. Someone dismantled it. Guess who. feel like today good day Australia .45,000 thousand tests done 9 positives 6 overseas arrivals mandatory quarantine. 

In state Western Australia positive case outside os arrivals mandatory quarantine six months. restrictions state minimal,the economy booming, state budget surplus ,the unemployment rate lowest Australia ,the GDP per person well $100,000 place US might better us financially District Columbia .Anyway closing border since March key protecting state RWNJ's Australia trying pressure Western Australian state government easing border restrictions start opening borders.The state government (the lefties) approval rating 92% unprecedented.If things hold politicly right side politics face oblivion come next election March next year 55 seats left maybe 2 maybe zero right. .The official stance state government open borders 28 days zero covid cases nationaly rants right politics Australia getting louder .The Murdoch press calls WA state government fearmongers etcetera brings interviews split families can't see closed borders( course could reunite would mean leaving state probs job). may come head next month so.Hopefully get point case numbers low Australia open borders safely Western Australian state government doubt stand firm closed borders.

Edit - WA =Western Australian virus divided friends family many.

While true, virus actually fault. like Facebook making people look stupider. always stupid, obvious now. know, probably something Trump I've never worked midlevels add technicians well.
* Ultrasound/Echocardiography: physician it.
* Blood draws: I'm joking, phlebotomists nearly places. East, often nurses West: fun residents €250k degree paid tax payer. Oh, residents overworked. Good luck med students, too!
* Peripheral IVs: Same.
* Starting infusion increased risk anaphylaxis first time: Apparently nurses can't page patient actually one.

Frankly, increase physicians 200k 1990 350k nowadays reflects shifts work-life balance, physicians working fewer hours, often part-time employed etc. matter dead man.

No, there's small chance I'll crippled life. likely outcome even notice it. chances bad outcome lower 1%. mention getting infected raises chance someone high risk getting infected.

Capitalism + narcissistic leadership Thanks Trump downplaying pushing Herd Immunity nonsense. Thank breaking layman like me. really appreciate took time format comment way thats clear whatnot. Just, thanks that. whole Herd Immunity approach laughably bad one, pretty much everyone world aside three crackpots sponsoring idea agreement that. seven good reasons they, people advocating infection-based herd immunity, right:

1). disease history controlled infection based herd immunity. It’s possible small community isolated, larger communities, ability duration time takes virus circulate makes impossible. allow uncontrolled spread less contagious diseases like flu, cold, norovirus illnesses. Humanity developed herd immunity these. Part viruses mutate quickly allow long-lasting immunity secondly COVID contagious, contagious enough allow enough people infected without deliberately infecting people controlled manner infect 75-80% population, enough ensure herd immunity, virus changes again. even infection-based herd immunity diseases like measles, rubella smallpox, disease actually confer life-long immunity controlled vaccination, ensures consistent reliable immunity, infection.

2). plan demands entire demographics people put home arrest indefinitely. Protecting vulnerable community gets infection rates low enough level containment sufficient manage illness good strategy allows vulnerable eventually participate community again. idea 'sheltering vulnerable' context herd immunity means people diabetes, people asthma, cancer survivors, transplant recipients, people HIV immunodeficiency, people auto immune disorders, elderly, people color would sheltered infect enough people get immunity community level, impossible. gross violation human rights would impossible put practice without basically creating hermetically sealed concentration camps vulnerable people would resettled. isn’t even considering horrible consequences demanding people either put lives danger working losing income alternative, making environment safer, discounted.

3). Maximizing infection expose people increase suffering death. still know long term effects result COVID infections. least 10% people never recover illnesses. people showing significant cardiac damage, even minor symptoms. People major symptoms severe consequences illness, including PTSD, amputations, diminished lung capacity, possible vulnerability illnesses before. way sure long term consequences would illness, lots people exposed disease unknown consequences long-term irresponsible dangerous.

4). guarantee immunity long lasting, even effective based infections. Already reports reinfections confirmed showing people reinfected new mutations systems. means trying spread virus widely possible may result massive suffering, disability, death, months, immunity longer effective, making suffering death pointless. Coronaviruses generally create immunity lasts couple years. immunity expires within months.

5). objections raised lockdowns addressed means. enhanced unemployment people lose jobs. develop mental health care people issues dealing stresses lockdowns, including family counseling, situations. improve learning experience online learning, people lose businesses, develop low cost loan programs help people. New protocols using PPE isolation ensure people require cancer screenings emergency care get without exposing people COVID. ways address public health address unfortunate consequences things like school shutdowns health care problems.

6). later people exposed unknown disease, better. Sweden one worst cumulative per capita death rates world recently primary reason allowed lots people become infected good therapeutics available. Even now, Sweden continues one worst per capita death rates world result type exercise – countries won’t able catch them. Finland, Norway, Denmark second wave infections it’s pretty severe, death total minuscule compared Sweden thanks initial suppression infection rates.

7). serious epidemiologists sanctioning approach, mostly due arguments. Countries actually brought infection control adopted lockdown strategy works. plenty people offer opinion, gotten mainstream support arguments cannot reasonably addressed anyone background epidemiology.

In summary, process dangerous demonstrably ineffective. needs discredited explained public clearly people supporting either based ignorance maliciousness. motives people pushing questioned – people really concerned public health desperate get lives back normal reaching wishful thinking. malicious people fortunes tied people following strategy, like rich people want economy get back normal benefit enhanced stock prices care much suffering death pays it. people couldn’t vacation Florida governor human decency pro life claims.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* problem study drugs given patients hospitals obvious reasons become clear point body fighting virus anymore massive immunological deregulation. Dexamethasone better indicated stage, antivirals given beginnings infections. Well, America went invade Libya Syria, lesson clearly well learned... factor privatized vs socialized healthcare systems play controlling pandemic? far Covid death-rate goes (percentage Covid patients ending dead), think factor healthcare is, prevent Covid patients dying right, cause that's healthcare systems do.

Here Covid death-rate statistics 2.7%, **France**: 4%, **Spain**: 3.4%, **UK**: 6.3%, **Italy**: 9.3%, **Netherlands**: 3.1%, **Canada**: 5%, **Belgium**: 5.3%, **Sweden**: 5.7%


As see, twice likely die Covid great care Canadian, British Swedish healthcare systems, three times likely over-praised Italian system, seems point making irrelevant healthcare either small factor factor all. Almost? There's still time  amount planning, preparation resources make lack political societal unity. That's awesome, thanks update! Last heard Trump Army coordinating everything.

Then today NPR taking states scrambling get distribution plans CDC.

And this. answer: Republicans. Check net worth sherlock.
He almost doubled net worth since founded foundation investments almost profit oriented.
He first billionaire this. problem study drugs given patients hospitals obvious reasons become clear point body fighting virus anymore massive immunological deregulation. Dexamethasone better indicated stage, antivirals (as any) given beginnings infections. Surely remember prime ministers presidents world time Spanish Flu, history books refer mass murderers. live elderly mother guy electric company came door today. wearing mask answered door. needed open gate let backyard. 5-10 minutes without mask spit grass. dog run area mow week. need worry? wait mow? safe dog run was? No, backed science, were, come different conclusion. backed ideology, like ""declaration"". may know it, are. Massive numbers legitimate epidemiologists pushed back hard ideas, clearly ideologically-driven nonsense.

Separate vulnerable still caring physical medical needs, somehow. stay separated, fault get sick die.

I reported post. Hopefully mods delete soon disappear good.

Edit: already removed. nice. Goodbye. Make CDC great again.  Human selfishness. I’ve seen countless posts, tik toks, news articles people. People partying. People packing bars. People shoulder shoulder vacation hot spots. 

I firmly believe regardless planning preparation, would still are. even close numbers man. Confirmed cases significantly less total infections realistic, non bait estimates ALWAY beginning 2021, even spring research ramped up. nothing changed.

We get like dozen vaccines show immune response, many Phase III tests without prohibitive side effects yet, (like pfitzer one) already full production anticipating acceptance roll out. anyone think US world's best prepared nation this? Seriously anyone thought never worked country. Even us good jobs expected work sick. bad jobs work sick sick pay. top large population people insurance cannot access medical care without risking bankruptcy. part sounds like country prepared pandemic? Add Trump well ya go... disaster waiting happen. Okay, how. Tularemia deaths cases increase 2001 2009.

Do mean classed potential bioterror agent dumped way much money biodefense? lot pathogens Anthrax attacks. leadership place. like failed project/plan/agenda/work environment etc. Leadership falls, something grand goes awry.

Edit: word. “better” particularly useful constructive

Very true. We're well enough probably focus real problems try decide covid-19 leader/winner every week.  I’m tired people making Fauci iconic figure. guy wolf sheep’s clothing. conflicts interest relative vaccine patents troubling. seems care infectious diseases vaccines patent, allergic immunological diseases. things supposed responsibility. He’s NIH/NIAID 50 years now, tenure, peanut allergies population tripled (and 21% 2010 2017 alone), along countless food allergies children. Autoimmune diseases skyrocketing, affecting least 24 million Americans prevalence rising. diseases much damaging COVID, cost healthcare system much COVID, affect families much COVID. Fauci’s time NIH, health American people rapidly deteriorated. took office NIH, 12% Americans chronic illness. Today, 54% Americans chronic illness. Chronic illnesses, allergies, cancers autoimmune diseases rapidly rising children well. Fauci’s alliance vaccine manufacturers pharma companies, American people. president literally said masks work YESTERDAY could really grim winter. hope fear worst. Remdesivir also Regeneron product dexamethsone. think 'us' 'us swedes', 'USA' there's good change crippled life catch it? mention getting infected raises chance someone high risk getting infected. you's running around infected greater (not lesser) greater chance fewer people vulnerable populations survive. 30% population talking quarantining indefinitely somehow reducing restrictions mandates. It's. Not. Possible.

It might dumbest idea ever. world's best prepared nation, far.
How could nation FREE BASIC HEALTH CARE, could considered ready confront anything like that? Come on. Germany quite well-equipped, - terms ICU capacity, national plan, network health departments,...

Israel also quite well initially.

Still, places major issues, unless dictatorship remote island.

That's issue rare event things. Super-spreader events rare, happen, really bad. Hard contain anyone. Ive much pain months feel like dying.

 


I'm athletic 30 year old male. Yes top public health interventions time! Translation: foreigners fault. us. Thanks glorious guidance Winnie Brussels pubs became financial stable lockdown. 20% pubs bad papers cause hardly got visitors covid. good earning pubs loose lot money lot influence. 


Also temporary governement dare impose strong measurements. New governement waited long 2nd worse europe. think claims hospitals calling death “covid death”? without basis? Wait....did miss something last hour U.S. spiraled almost inconceivable failure regards Covid? lol 89 actually lots people states maintain second homes / beach houses Florida?  they're going camp apartment either way, might well there's good weather. 

I know several New Yorkers dreading expected winter rebound trying get place lower population density winter. Trump. replying guy told follow numbers. It‘s like choosing teammates dodge ball. Nobody ever picks Karen. Europe actually tamped virus reasonable level using lockdowns restrictions people actually obeyed part. long term solution things opening back looser restrictions they're spiking (plus fall weather).

The US loose recommended restrictions vary wildly state. Mask mandates, banning large gatherings closing super spreader businesses (bars restaurants) - that's pretty much it. effective enough prevent widescale exponential growth, tamp things European lockdown levels. US third wave nearly pronounced Europe's US allowed slow burn potentially 15-20% population already infected presumably immune point.

Time tell terms stagey best. US may've stumbled blindly best case scenario winter. allowing slow burn prevented hospitals becoming overwhelmed - time building level heard immunity (not nearly enough stop it, hopefully enough slow it). takes special kind stupid take pride ones stupidity. people sorry, people willing learn mistakes. people want whole world know stupid double stupidity whenever questioned.

These kind people wonder about: ""how even alive?"" Money. Money general public never see ever hear about. déjà-vu French word Republicans Trump inconceivable racist Facist failure! Yeah. hope Biden wins. Bury face mountains yodeling daily case count FL TX. much smaller population. happened. Congratulations! Hoping stay safe then! Pornography consumption ?  Crazy idea, know, maybe morbidly obese might help? Paging Susan Collins! Pretty much entire Republican party comes things actually ""happening them.""

\- stem cell research life saving drug administered derived stem cell research.

and on.. Reopening indoor establishments like bars restaurants patrons remove masks shown spreader situation. Gyms also bad combination. situation retail shops varies wildly depending amount space available, ventilation, sanitation performed.  It’s difficult balance strike reopening economy vs flattening curve (it feels like idea got abandoned given WH wants push herd immunity AKA “just let die nothing”)  fun! London cool city! Go Chinatown district, best food life last year. fairness, stated thought White House safe zone. least wrong White House Management. go home. mom year treatment stage 4 pancreatic cancer. It’ll way different I’ll lawn chair driveway she’ll inside screened porch, I’m gonna make work. platform school online.

Why switch Zoom like rest world? pretty much overnight, teachers tech savvy, guess give training something, still take long. Canada want need Americans.  really, sincerely hope, gets issue people.

Just wear mask. partisan issue it. really problem. medical condition prevents wearing one. problem breathing it. Please entire planet favor wear mask. Hoping little one stay safe healthy then. :)  Correct I'm wrong, believe Dakotas already set record cases per capita ever recorded US, right? Like NY worst. reasonable response treating 99.98% basically unaffected like causing pandemic.

Look Sweden did. USA far Sweden far better situation. Sweden basically nothing allow citizens act responsibly.

Be cautious. Wash hands. feel sick go out. compromised take extra precautions. younger healthy avoid compromised.

It's rocket science.

Instead, USA locks people supports thousands protesting together - many without masks.

&amp;#x200B;

 super naive think lockdown, business would great. able go sit inside restaurant drink bar right now. don’t it’s disgusting spread virus like that. Also, take risk? Opening sudden bring crowds revenue.

Again, see don’t understand point masks. would assume know gave guidance early given shortages. 

That's Fauci said. narrative changed shortages. original point masks little anything stop virus. Also, point medical professionals wearing horseshit masks 95% populace wearing right full month wife use N95. right give guidance given many idiots made run toilet paper.

She must work place overseen shitty governor like Cuomo never came close running masks still stockpiled them.

But hey, wife wear one shitty masks everyone else wearing? work good, wear one? big deal? 

Newsflash: wearing mask natural. wear one anyway even though I'm convinced anything even though narrative changed months wife wears N95 surgical mask 18 hrs time. 

That's job kids wear one 7 hours day. wear one playing soccer too. 

And fucking hate supporting like Cry masks like rest babies. It’s pretty pathetic.

Says guy crying me. course, going make money healthy people ? gym people wear masks spin class, during? Probably due lot cases going unnoticed positivity rate like 30% fact die many fragile people spring many countries seeing increased infection numbers now. Yea , let’s see studies Bill Foley let slip maybe Feb 1st interview. think likely vaccine possible. also may start all-Canada division.... ignoring potential upside less possibility stretching natural resources thin population. I'm pretty sure environmental damage we've done whip asses.

That would violate hippocratic oath think lot doctors would find morally unethical. that's 20%. 27% mainland China. what's point?

You know epitomize First World Privilege. rail atrocities caused western nations safely enjoying benefits, including one openly criticize government. understand point, doesn’t people buying mean people afford buy house?

Sadly, thing that's happening there, that's europe cases increasing, everywhere happening same, long since everyone avoiding social life plus cold starting hit people social life inside walls.

Btw, Catalonia bit better spanish areas like Madrid starting close restaurants, pubs, limiting meets 6 people... least trying something Madrid others refuse anything even like 6 times covid cases per 100.000 Barcelona.  learnt previous hospital transmission event Northeast China back April Holy shit. mistake. Kinda typed auto-pilot. Good catch. I'll fix it. virus infects via mucus membranes, covid hands+itchy eye = infection.

Breathing contaminated food sticking eye, nose butt bad idea too.

Gastric acid kill virus, would probably breathe small particles eating anyway. Watch Hollywood suck China's cock even harder Let's wait 100% full, lockdown needs even longer get back everyone catches lockdown goes ICU two weeks hosed. 👏 send txts bad enough, could read comment. Gene strains cases sequenced showed ""high degree isogeny"" None measures take seem effect, short full lockdown. Also, none treatments try relevant benefits. thought control summer. question distance. leak end-up falling gravity within 50cm, bad provided keep distance. cough keeps spreading several meters away that's another story. (IIRC) people die year respiratory illness

About 2.5mln actually. pool tests, imagine binary search. Split half test half, one part positives saved 5 million tests.

This works low prevalence places, otherwise basically approach one test per person worth lab results. Shops fine, workplace - I'm talking factory level. okay doubt government.

but see it'll clear alot questions head really.

everytime went china amazes more.

that effective america's propaganda machines are. research suggested could last surprisingly long Results

Survival rates SARS-CoV-2 determined different temperatures D-values, Z-values half-life calculated. obtained half lives 1.7 2.7 days 20 °C, reducing hours temperature elevated 40 °C. initial viral loads broadly equivalent highest titres excreted infectious patients, viable virus isolated 28 days 20 °C common surfaces glass, stainless steel paper polymer banknotes. Conversely, infectious virus survived less 24 h 40 °C surfaces. too. Darn Good luck that. Halloween, Thanksgiving, Black Friday, Christmas. It'll perfect storm infections. Throw election mix, ... where's popcorn? guess stark family sees coming.

brace yourself, winter coming. Can't confirm that, least region. 95% wear masks shops work, although cases here. Homeoffice still common (even quite much beginning year), supported sometimes even required employer protect vulnerable coworkers. comparison per capita students rest population though? Good thing got $1200 one time, right y’all? lmfao Shoulda wore Biden masks. greatest nightmare trapped upside nutty putty cave, icus overrun pretty bad  sooner better. Belgian government even gave free rail passes.

Which used rate twice month, make sure anything catch first unnecessary train ride gets spread everyone around second unnecessary train ride.

Basically, governments care, therefore people care, first lockdown associated economic damage accomplished absolutely nothing. saying 6000+ children dying starvation third world matter? guess they're white; westerners.

Well, yes, almost everyone west saying. 6000+ lmao, like 600m+ comes global warming. lol, look happened us pumped 300 billion economy(3times Bill Gates’s net worth) form stimulus check. split net worth among people earth everyone would receive 20$, definitely enough end poverty.... live rural, northern Illinois people straight give fuck. quite huge if.  Many accounts symptoms re-emerging tested positive antibodies, even donated some. One simple explanation could immunity don’t recognise mutation. Seems antibodies China strain can’t neutralise European strain example. mass murder  Repeat me. Case numbers useless. Case numbers always useless. always useless. 

New cases closely correlated amount tests. testing basically nobody March, testing slightly now, way catching even 40% new infections, clue fatality rate use new cases metric. see evidence build immunity coronavirus. one perfect slow burn forever. treatment solve it. ask why? find much inconvenience? amount people screaming ""stupid"" ""herd immunity real"" really shows grip hysteria. 


Basic biology people screaming bloody murder here. even want know, thoroughly scared hyped dumbed media. 


People seriously say herd immunity real. quote millions die also think 30 million recovered cases 23 positive PCR tests means people get huge numbers ""severe cases"" get COVID inifinitely. even enter mind cases could false positives severely immunocompromised. 


I'm guffawing shock. people even want know actually going on? actual neurosis point.  


They even thinking logically. immunity, means vaccine work either. 


These people far gone literally want scared. 


Someone shouting people idiots basic scientific fact like herd immunity exist shows existed pure media alarm dumbed drivel seen sunlight since march. 


Things natural resistance, cross immunity heterogenity beyond them. want believe scare now, fear like drug them. 


It must awful live world emergency hospitals dismantled sitting thinking get COVID get week later end ventilator even get asymptomatic case one 100,000s people ""severe organ damage"" (that somehow overloading healthcare systems speak),. must truly terrifying. actually feel sorry them. still feel like bus station LAX? Belgium, government lies schools source infection, even though cases started skyrocketing schools opened.

It surprise one trusts government anymore. Imagine thinking economy would go normal without lockdown. Pls, Macron shit non-stop handling crisis he's trying shift blame ministers Don’t know you’re getting downvoted venting. every right feel you’re feeling, feelings valid. wish could offer support, saying understand feel. I’ve going myself, bit differently essentially same. That's great all. moment NZ opens world virus get cases rise. point either lock face consequences Sweden accept people going die. got built immunity all.

Actually even going keep slipping quarantine going keep extremely damaging lockdowns accept become endemic like flu. influences laws get set? literally living presidency prioritizes economy people. can't imagine.  yet, despite masks, Europe worse US.

So far, treatments worked, countermeasures short full lockdown accomplished anything. virus spreads via aerosol, way stop spread indoors, forcibly keeping people communal areas homes. coronavirus, treatment vaccine.

We'll increase hospital capacity hope save everyone _can_ saved next years. going die going die, lot it. Everyone else survives infections build resistance. small enough support NZ citizens residents pretty generous. Tourism big business one expects go away good, industry hibernation subsidies. nice - sports games/concerts/, eat out, travel country friends family, wear mask, also leave freely want to. job losses there, they're everywhere, they're horrible, lose job hop decent benefit, start looking again, study free, healthcares linked it...  Japan also never single hospital come anywhere near capacity. weight-training routine can't fully replicated home. (At least, without dedicated weight-training space lot expensive equipment.) Exactly. Europeans drive would great doubt happen. Even smallest kind covid prevention costs money. Many countries developing world also already feel impact lockdowns developed countries. sad is, pandemic got started. dental profession good people sociopathic tendencies. Easy said done. 

Respiratory viruses unlikely generate long-lasting responses reinfection rare. can't see schools safely stay open. goes Flanders. would they? stock market great. /s Governments need admit virus spreads aerosol buildings safe. *""two new studies show least 6 million people US poverty due effects Covid-19 pandemic""*

That lot people, population country.. Trump pity us seems likely he'll lose reelection. Wants us die. 

You know, Hitler people became obvious Germany going lose war. 

Pathetic. extended family getting together thanksgiving. anybody really quarantining anymore? one learned goddamn thing That's acute. Herd immunity 2 years, woot! claiming least 80 330 million infected, would 24% population. Perhaps looking reports prevalence NYC estimated 25% peak. Nowhere else country sort peak (yet).

Locations like NYC serious outbreaks protected bejeezus scared them, actually following public health guidelines. They're actually physically immune, got smart real quick. Shits crazy. don’t understand isn’t mainstream. researchers. noble thing planet right don’t get wrong sometimes professionals rely heavily scientific method think wary making statements 100% certainty. get, results studies pretty damn confounding ask me. 
Eh, even made massive statement people would still behave roughly similar I’d guess. Well, maybe minority hope like anti-maskers. Although shared Vit. stuff friends got mixed reaction knows. think everyones information overloaded point don’t really care. literally giving Specifically Wallonia Brussels.

Good luck, guys. hotspot Belgium, due ignoring corona measures police really willing patrol neighbourhoods.  BC still lots teaching jobs, although we’re still recovering 10+ years previous provincial government trying decimate public school system it’s bit mess. I'm sure downvoted saying this. completely right. Anyone ""needs"" go gym desire, necessity. higher risk activity. would equate someone going spa pandemic. ""need"" achieve physical benefits things. It’s less deadly March/April.  Full quote:

""If let things rip let infection go -- masks, crowd, make difference -- quite frankly, George, ridiculous many people community can't shelter, can't protect, going get sick get serious consequences,"" Fauci said. ""So idea power protect vulnerable total nonsense, history shown that's case. talk anybody experience epidemiology infectious diseases, tell risky wind many infections vulnerable people, lead hospitalizations deaths. think got look square eye say nonsense."" per capita. seems Europe USA get nothing vaccine. get high horse start toll manufacturing vaccine immediately. somtimes? soo far yet fall. gonna enforced though? DC required outdoor masks clearly enforced get spotty compliance. say let them. Agree them. Tell hoax lick subway poll. One less idiot vote rest us death. Best explanation is:

US best prepared nation pandemic

-stated America Dutch deaths per million 340. US deaths per million 730. dont forget dutch population density 10 times higher, making spreading virus easier. EU equally bad US moment. Rose Garden event outside. yea exactly! look $$$ ignore casualties
if 1 4 customers dies... still save 75% losses staying open whole incredibly selfish stupid people. Hyperbole. Hey WI, made bed. Best get laying. 

Remember times struck stay home orders continues climb can't ignore anymore.  president psychopath. even question? BC government officially recommended glory holes time ago there’s that....... president cunt. Donald Trump Maybe older population? Depends high set bar.

Consider traffic lights. Plenty pedestrians ignore red cross over. Yet lights still put place. So, what's point people ignore them?

Sure, could automate everything point fine already paid reach side road. think that's gonna fly parts world individual liberty valued. So, enforce running red lights? Make sure there's enough chance getting caught point enough people feel reward - saving seconds - worth running risk. There's sweet point enough people wait cross, societal acceptable level safety attained.

Same applies Covid rules. course, can't force everyone wear masks abide rules unless take draconian measures. even go road, risk backlash losing grip situation even bigger.

The point find right balance. Ensure there's enough chance get caught act enough people abide rules; come entirely authoritarian / unbelievable either.  Try reading it. work small community hospital Ohio. Last week 9 covid patients. week, 47. Wear masks wash hands!

Simp    mom 65+ year old RN cannot afford stop working. also highest risk group due heart condition. work, medical facility, provides paper masks. found supplier N95s bought 100 last forever know I'll able find another box. said since letting people clinic symptoms need paper masks, infuriates me. mean really simple terms: hit worst possible federal Administration, terms ability handle crisis.

But weak points predate that. 50 different state governments inherently problematic try implement kind national strategy kind, all, split nature power even federally means always tug-of-war important issues. course for-profit health care system exactly best thing times national crisis, either. live rural area. 2 deaths 156 infected since march.... Still tiny trickle though despite doom-mongers. We're still stage individuals reported on, longer case initial infections within weeks.

There seems pattern though, either mild first time serious second time vice versa, suggesting stronger immune response first time builds durable immunity. seems like good sign means strong immune response vaccine durable immunity. Well city, lot people social distancing outside sometimes impossible... Remindme! 2 weeks  America piss poor job too. piss poor leadership nothing lol Yeah they've saying since start pandemic. one really cares tho bars usually stuffed woth people. Anders Tegnell recently said personally worried covid-19 crossing road much bigger risk compared covid-19. Lower amount time, people try go smaller timeframe. 

Genius!!!!!! months ago u said one worst prepared healthcare system crazy cultist here. Thats why. one state takes virus seriously other?

Granted, I'm sure parts Florida dealing better parts state, parts California relaxed strictest parts CA. living California tell people serious face masks here, nice weather everyone know meets friends families outdoors instead indoors. way Trump voters would send money black guy. C'mon, know point we're tired talking him. Dogging trending earlier reason

Idk consider ""viable"" expert field, lot researchers working vaccine itself, immunologists, even Fauci (in recent interviews) optimistic Q1 distribution vaccine, best. believe them, that's theme I've seen. Also, believe back, research said vaccine would 2-3 dose booster. think June/July unrealistic, though. 

Say want America's views this, call false hope whatever, best right remain optimistic continue precautions. reason live grim, glass-half-empty life COVID issues instead unstable reddit users insist need seriously discussing “but never get vaccine??

We listened start recommend masks too, right?

Fauci fucking God, yes, perfectly acceptable discuss 'what if' scenario, given vast majority diseases recieve vaccinations. BS top but..but...this time he's telling truth!  Bruh gonna sit around pretend know exactly spiraled 😅 X love guardian think people going whatever (and whoever) want naive. whole reason they've introduced new tier system people stay home first place. Democrats calling trump xenophobic closed borders March China well China CDC reporting correct valid data regarding virus. know downvoted quoting Fauci.

Probably spam thread comments like every single day author smoking? US LEAST prepared country Earth. Why? much freedom. Freedom blessing curse. case pandemic, definite curse. ideal government deal pandemic would dictatorship benevolent ruler. 50 states thing based ill-informed opinions little government recipe disaster. US continue perform horribly there's united response. can't be. constitution set limit power federal government. matter president is, going get better. surprised we're still dealing shit 10 years road every developed country got control 9+ years ago. I’m getting one immediately. lot people work afraid first. know Pakistan city USA, informative Hepatitis C silly comparison. chronic infection persists many years. Coronavirus, hand, seems completely eliminated body patient full immune responce. can't comoare two. I’m nervous airports airplanes themselves. Granted, I’m often flying LAX, might indicative human density airports. tend many ailments unfortunately. I’ve going gym too. think point accept unless absolutely nothing take calculated risks. 

I working home, I’m take public transport, I’m going pub, I’m hardly seeing people, I’m people over, wearing mask appropriate.

I understand people want stay forever gym hour isn’t big deal number interactions already low.

Add fact everyone wears masks moving around gym, equipment wiped down, gym deep cleaned every night gym spaced work areas risks reduced again. low people want risks reduced? What's difference touch face covid hands eating food covid it? testing nothing like March April real cases likely 5-10x higher day though. Lol gangbangers dont wear masks still frequently throwing house parties live at? hope want die brown might nono you. April New Jersey loopholes ...

* air ventilation system boarding leaving?
* many people sincerely keep masks alone airplane bathroom?
* quickly air bathroom replaced?
* going someone next starts coughing? stand leave? open window? :-P
* infection vectors passengers, stewards/stewardesses. walking around breathing talking. often everyone plane crew tested? daily? really?

An infected person infectious symptoms appear.

It suffcient one person team tested. tested avoid bad luck false negative results.

Reason: false negative rate best average 20%

 

 hospital chains sending one big hospital Looks like multiple times. can't lawyer way

out pandemic big hospitals probably number nearby rural hotspots Beat watched 1.5x speed 42k? get from? Thank reading study. time xin fa di market spread epidemic its, go Xin Fa near infection. would that?

Because willing admit corruption fake data endemic, want save face cost, even cost lives maybe think risk worth it.

You completely correct way. KNOW world needs vaccine, pushing vaccine use geopolitical tool spread influence emerging economies. tried similar thing beginning pandemic: donated lot medical equipment tests without true quality control. time reasoning would logical too:"" would risk losing reputation giving away defective equipment"" happened, lots lots equipment deemed subpar defective.

Again, masterplan rushing defective vaccine, malice, chinese corporations already showed willing fake data results reach party asks directly indirectly. Yeah recall that, think earlier news week ago chairman one companies said ""under 1,000 RMB per dose"". one inactivated virus vaccine (it SinoPharm remember correctly).

So technically true, likely there's either government subsidy involved refinement manufacturing process.

I surprised vaccines within China gets subsidies. government would rather pay money vaccine deployment pay 10 million test every time there's outbreak ala Qingdao. sure, speculating.  happens throw Kurt Angle mix? everything right. Except know going gym attending mask less spin class. worry.... It'll 2 months soon. Think website gave phone Covid. source said market dose 300RMB (this new says 200RMB).

I recall asking time ago, that's much lower price first announced, it?

Or one? No, didn't. Masks anywhere public indoors area stupid. ""The study conducted team included members United Airlines, Boeing""

No conflict interest here. Europe manged managing crisis much better USA... comparison came mostly USA Europe.. 

Was listening yesterday Reuters saying bad Europe disaster etc... European lives Germany Family Slovenia, Italy, England dont seem see crisis describe. meat city MO. think KCK think pretentious twats Overland Park Prarie Village. flu long term complications 
Malaria long term complications 
Tb long term complications 
Malnutrition long term complications 
Cholera long term complications 

It’s like whole “long covid” thing completely new phenomenon. 

But nobody seem source numbers frequency long covid get them, covid christmas ones will. I’ve heard two friends working nhs. Reinfection seems unusual highly exposed virus. think it’s difficult prove needs dna analysis sample virus, infection reinfection, ensure they’re different (and one long infection recurring symptoms).

I anticipate eventually start showing general population, nhs workers, news. Poor nhs staff canaries gold mine! Worth note soap also extremely effective. could be, airplanes packed strange people 2/3 times day. one knows. many people covid know it? many 1st infections actually 2nd? (Caveat I'm huge hypochondriac scenarios varying levels likely): Covid scary, smallpox coming back antibiotic resistant plague strain spreading pig ebola crossing species barrier, really scare me.


This crisis shown overly globally interconnected crowded we've become, least big cities, ability (or maybe political will) stamp things spread. exceptions travel you’ve year endure two week quarantine entering. applied hopefully approved here! still getting it. CCP invested considerable time effort money covid19 eradication. enforced stringent measures controlled virus significant cost. Even remain vigilant religiously trace isolate new infection. 

Because measures CCP earned enormous support goodwill China. Chinese people favorable view CCP, thanks rest world failed controlling virus. CCP puts defective vaccine it'll lose support. would that?

China need put defective vaccine successfully controlled infection. afford wait meanwhile people follow restrictions since understand gravity situation. US rest world actually desperately needs vaccine spectacularly failed suppression. Im sure getting downvoted bro, stay strong upvote.

Just pointing like theres new trier US gets downvoted. 

Excuse wtf?! [When Cue stupid covid Thanksgiving parties... reason believe - tests least vaccines produced antibodies people infection. wrong. vaccination rate required ""herd immunity"" depends disease's R0. Measles high R0 (12-18) requires 95% immunization prevent breakouts. Covid-19 communicable range R0 = 2.5-5 (depending location, since R0 really fixed dependent location). might take vaccination rates 60-80%. Measles vaccine extremely effective (higher 95%), know first wave Covid vaccines. effectiveness high, say 80% effective, may need 75-95% vaccination rate. Supplies mostly fine right now. Oy vey. Grow up. started rising summer already september came. Schools reopened everyone went Back work cases accelerated even more. wanna say schools werent biggest issue start it. end summer already tracing capacities full. couldnt trace everyone really start things started get real bad. Schools werent main cause. fuck what...? going, going, turkey, right put oven..? Yeah roommate got priority symptoms, thé result came back 48h (negative thankfully) think sammiches could make, kept yourself. *them*. least that's tell say. Mask mandates significantly altered transmission trend country state far. single case introduction mask mandate (not introduced simultaneous ton measures) led observable change transmission trends within 2-3 weeks. That's fact. Results published yet though, hopefully soon Pretty much doctor afford move state suck, that's do.

Actually, opposite.

In general, much harder find job doctor downtown SF somewhere lot people want live. hard appeal doctors move rural Tennessee, pay places higher.

A friend's fiancee getting paid crazy amounts drive rural Nevada 6-day stints doctors want live there. Another family member wife rural Alabama years train work medical debt. want live there, super cheap get paid really well. afford to, move. fine call but, like virus started Wuhan, going able silence people. We'd hearing problems back channels still. actually heard source China phase 3 clinical trial three four Chinese vaccine candidates currently phase 3 successfully completed. (Not clear three, almost certainly three inactivated virus vaccine, CanSino's phase 3 started much later three).

The source says phase 3 clinical trial results excellent three, three vaccines available full scale deployment end month. Yearly production figures within China expected 1 billion doses per year. China intends take 200 million doses vaccinate risk people distribute remaining 800 million BRI countries. source said market dose 300RMB (this new says 200RMB).

Very vulnerable last two years social-distancing. One friends one healthiest people know. Young (25), personal trainer, ate primarily vegetarian diet still good amount protein, health issues all, pretty much always active. got covid back May June, basically permanent cardiac damage now. virus caused pericarditis, even now, 4 months later, abnormal heart rhythm sporadic palpitations every then. read couple articles young healthy people suffering long term damage brushed lot thinking probably underlying condition something. actually see shit happen first hand, becomes much real scary. time national emergency, approval always rubber stamp away.

I'm anti vax - ordinary vaccine, ordinary situation. Academics studying effects pandemic next 100 years. Interesting times. 👍  fact, days ago, rumors cases contracted poorly sterilized CT machine, officially denied hospital, hospital's director person charge hygiene Qingdao dismissed.

A new official news release today confirms infection occurred poorly sterilized CT machine.

&amp;#x200B;

At time like this, rumor could clue needs thoroughly investigated. true summer. fucked. understand people claim deaths virus related. Gotta remember people laid off, working, furloughed, businesses gone well. Many won’t able afford travel. prudent, that's one concerned US right Biden restore CDC. simple let job -- stop sabotaging. like compare Europeans countries US anymore. America truly descends chaos, Canada hard time keeping border shut people coming asylum application. someone really intent escaping Canada, super easy boat hiking forest. people wear mask shield hospitals. say mask protect others shield protect them. sound reasonable? Lol make sound like killing religious freedom awesome. Everything say Soo wrong. asked press le Figaro government could provide statistic many homeschoolers Islamic separatist, none. thought small. Also, say learn French even french law homeschooling supervised examine, separatist pass tests ""don't speak French"". people learning difficulties affected anyone else. Also christians affected muslims.

I'm saying law anything covid definitely appropriate time given. Rick Bright President. Canada reopen US case count per capita becomes larger equal US? Trudeau hypocrite, case. think excellent graphics [VG.no shows difference Nordic countries. look total admissions (Innlagte + Antall) steepness curve different mind shows much larger initial outbreak Sweden - measures effect. people infected steeper infection curve be. nature exponential functions think it’s pretty clear seeing. not? Symptoms appear 4 5 days later. Meanwhile, people spreading it. Make mistake, healthcare workers sacrificial lambs. 

I expect stuck home next year life. I'm ER nurse, *I still reuse N95 mask*. change anytime soon. COVID, using N95 maybe ten times year. way gonna able get enough masks use 10+ day without domestic production.

I cannot protect ""by book."" never around high-risk family members without masked distanced, sake.

I'm stuck, totally mercy people's poor choices, can't get anytime soon. I'm trapped, choice get it, half country decides minor inconveniences hard, crunches collective bootheel. contradicting assertion Americans clinical standpoint, **idiots**. causes big boost sanitation third world countries may end saving lives kills. surprised supplies actually shipped last, highest bidder - somebody's cousin pockets money - never hear again. stay safe Florida too. avoid indoor dining inviting people over, fine. Whoever running state seemed fine months ago. Zero. Canadians free fly US still. say diagnosed pneumonia. alone take six months recover from. !RemindMe 4 months. would bet border reopening Feb 21st people fresh PCR test. Aye, may be, probably right. need something good going on. Tired everyone shitting everything, tired shite virus, fake news, lock downs, political fanatics (both sides), lies, misinformation, more, work harder, protests, anti-protests. want celebrate light all. matter brief. can't imagine dead inside. lack empathy. shame. No, false negatives common, 20% 100% according

People work/student visas still enter freely quarantine. tourism allowed unless citizen.

In theory could also apply asylum border. pandemic likely time judge looks case. Hey man, us 'T' States supposed stick together. 🤨 French employer never really favor working home . 10 minute walk tram stop cars bumper bumper right door I'm making up?? Yo type macron news google first results. limited US? Sheesh. jump obviously due backlog. though? numbers lower, testing per capita hospitals issues maybe even bit sooner. Huh? hard plastic permeable particles? plastic solid allow 100% aerosols thru?

Oh get it, that's water bottle plastic cup always wet outside take fridge. Maybe won't? saying. 😉👍 Eh, really normal normal, would imagine masks longer required capacity go back 100% restaurants gyms. Concerts things like may held back fall that’s even mentioning capacity mask wearing required not. would imagine day day life go back normal everything goes according plan.

Kansas City.. Actually Missouri.

Sorry, help it. :P

Really though, Missouri well. #4 union new cases Thursday. #18 population. That's bad math. yeah doubt see 'normalized' over. I'm going host mask burning parties done I've assumed airborne cruise ships nursing homes fiascos.  think dangerous Ebola, since think I've might it.     
I think nursing homes need air disinfecting equipment installed. Along ICU's, Covid-19 patient wards, bars, restaurants, etc. 400k cases day week mean 42000 humans dying, that's insane, 4 people minute Québécoise turns people keep getting infected months, would vaccine last longer? America. Last concert went wasted guy next wouldn’t shut entire concert wasn’t gay artist whipped dick, he’d race girlfriend stage suck yeah kinda miss concerts Plenty posts people saying they’ve reinfected r/COVID19positive. deniers can’t really subdue topic anymore, though still keep trying. North Kansas City Hospital, Truman Medical Center, St Lukes, St Lukes East, Research Hospital, University Kansas Medical Center, St Joe's, St Luke's Plaza location, Liberty Hospital, St Mary's, like 4 different childrens hospitals, Menorah Medical Center, Overland Park Regional, St Lukes Communty Hospital Shawnee... Yeah KC Metro area big. New Trier school non-fiction book adapted film ""Mean Girls"" focuses 24 hours later sound bit dodgy, it? Yup. Austin, today's hospitalizations 50% 7 day average -- transient, Texas continues place top 3 states new cases quite now. get we're finally old weak enough kills us? Life expectancy falls sharply scenario. Pretty grim. evidence this. someone wants propose partner next summer, hoping  OMG that's seriously crazy. looking good apparently seeing fast rise cases based data. Yes, indeed. Americans got much bad rep whole thing, people really come see French. I'm saying non-American non-French person. unbelievable people living never global pandemic. Looked like us minute there, practically zero sanitation, crazy overcrowding, extreme poverty. look good persevered.. Florida man cannot stopped. Herbert made big changes, things fine. /s projected area. That's pretty much point them. Market movie goers 8 here. think 4 within 10 minutes me, least 5 within 20. Read ""Reinfection cases tell us cannot rely immunity acquired natural infection confer herd immunity,"" Akiko Iwasaki, immunologist Yale University School Medicine, wrote commentary accompanying new study. ""Herd immunity requires safe effective vaccines robust vaccination implementation."" US context? I've read seen.. Undetected cases 5-10x higher detected, so.. we're probably looking million asymptomatic infections per day. interesting parallels yes (the mask thing best example) Spanish Flu waaay deadlier. ""Cases"" one newer: free risk *their own* health day long.  town ~1000 new cases past two weeks community 80,000. 

Wow good. Hope stay safe. aware that, humans get complacent sign hope. Correct points Found one. Lobbyist money, politicians beholden special interests, leaders personal axes grind asses cover. clear unified message consensus formulate one of. Idk people need told repeatedly
 filtration air wearing face shield out. 

In care facilities face shield worn patients might eject something non airborne you. airborne viruses present wear conjunction appropriately rated mask eye protection. 

I fly get work, always donned airport. n95, surgical mask top swap out, safety goggles face shield. messing around others can't bothered even cover mouth coughing let alone pandemic 

I go businesses staff wearing face shields going wearing mask social distancing count stupidity complacency? don’t think term mutually exclusive. maybe different definitions. Doesn’t seem like much difference. 

What would stupid Europe saw every mistake US made summer failed learn it. Seems like that’s happening now. Maybe it’s complacency. Maybe it’s stupidity. Maybe it’s arrogance. People starting take seriously here. walk around definitely see people masks.

But basically city still rumbles before. sure much working home going despite Mayor's order.

The kids holiday two weeks. Looks likely online learning older ones start next week. somehow still believe lying, essentialy believe faked data tell lie. Sir, must twisted mind.

By twisted mind mean paying attention history?

I dont think China lying putting fake data nothing surprised now. anyone know long still test positive Covid? first symptoms 2 weeks ago, I’ve self isolation 4 days now. That's wonderful positivity hope also. Sadly, humans flawed people's best assessments risk ethicality fall short acceptable minimums. Often means endanger immediately around them, cases cause widespread problems. viral pandemic exactly sort thing remind us many people cannot make safe, sane, ethical choices, fact serious consequences everyone else. look Russian flu schoolers think Coronavirus OC43 flu, took 5 years case numbers go become endemic virus think I'm hoping attend concerts Nov/Dec 2021.

Of course, Europe, worst governed country Europe (hint: health minister threw away strategic stock masks 2019, got scammed trying buy new masks first wave, finally procured some, abandoned warehouse missing label), low expectations even vaccine work, immunity lasting short, doubt we'll able leave homes 2022 best. one smarter people room. people think blithely accept ""CDC guidelines"" actually mean something written political hacks. exactly like person educated him/herself would it. Congrats. wish people like you. talk ""schools safe"" wrong studies schools Germany done summer months. Unfortunately Portugal doesn’t luxury shutdown whole country again. vaccine available yet, phase 3 trials. Yes. exactly is. much ignorance world, intentional not, literally happening within person's privileged bubble problem.  ""was"" operative word someone O- blood high vitamin levels, feel confident obesity high blood pressure going factor get virus. people get complacent vaccine? Oh. Would good say China title scenario vaccine strange illness rare.

Transverse myelitis says hello. Downvoted Spock quote? world coming to? Colds good example case. Common colds caused 200 different viruses main reason human body never build real resistance illness. even immune one them, 199 others chance infect you. Greece still pretty good. theres decent vaccine found next year two? economy can't afford keep locking another 2 years media drip feed bad news (reinfections, mutations, ineffectiveness promising treatments) die despair.

I trust positive news anymore, going bullshit anyway. expect yearly winter lockdown next 10 years survivors resistant. Anything better unexpected surprise. Pretty much I'm expecting big holidays plus winter weather. KC course. mention immunity barely lasts length time, enough vaccines sufficient, enough vaccines _every three months_ required.

Doesn't mention scenario requires confiscating vaccines rest world essentially killing Europe US survives (which strategy Trump actively pursues).

Doesn't mention elderly (the biggest risk group) respond poorly vaccines.

If wanted hear sweet lies alleviate anxiety, I'd go church. Literally going happen. Sorry Fauci. Congratulations! “good news” social contacts automatically reduced little one arrived—at least while. Herd immunity inevitable, simply description happens endemic virus persisted community long enough period time. likely reached poorer countries luxury able postpone inevitable hiding inside watching Netflix.

This problem lockdowns + trying suppress / eradicate virus:

Once gone route locking first time, put moral responsibility deaths follow onto hands government. result, Governments feel compelled act putting measure in, matter ill-founded damaging long term, appease people. 

Hence, reach logical absurdity politicians saying, ""It's worth saves single life"", sensible analysis see consequences lockdown measures cost far lives long run (e.g suspending cancer care, massive reduction heart disease + stroke treatment UK).

We normally hold Government's liable deaths old people flu, naturally occurring disease. recognise things tragic, also accept part biological organism existing wide ecosystem Planet Earth. 

It seems 2020 lost ability mature rational discussion mortality - ""safety culture"" protected risk led us point panic fear guide debate, rather reasonable look facts. let bodies hit floor China good leadership. Democracy can't handle this. may good time new kind planet scale revolution.

we technology, rebuilt Many reinfections worse second time.

Reinfection may milder _most_ people, all.

So going go: next 3 years, people repeatedly catch covid. get milder case, get worse case die. Repeat survivors built resistance.

Nothing affect this. vaccine problem. Treatments barely work. Lockdowns delay inevitable. Yup. 

Also wore mask gym restaurant, cinema allowed remove point mean covid going play virus safety theatre rules infect you. spin studio classes outside even going those. Group ex irl no. Inside side.  everybody dies 2020 covid-19 death matter happend you.... could die car crash count covid 19-death..... literally wipe everyone!!! Lt Governor Texas widely scorned suggesting grandma would willingly give life good Texas economy.

Now feds it. imma vote delirium People claim scientific sure willing plug ears scientific facts depressing contemplate. yeah, so, numbers ben updated 00:00 today, means yesterdays numbers. We're also testing 3-5x March. current measures pretty strict people actually stop private parties, case numbers decrease weeks. Seriously, fucking moron. Every country telling citizens countries better bunch lies. country likes masks lockdowns! Every stupid fuck complaining others wearing masks distancing kind morons need catch die. 7 months lower bound would practical vaccinate against. means we'll wait year longer full vaccination, booster shot twice year done.

2 months? way. doubt. amazing people still saying controlling impossible, example example countries it. know read recent french articles talking underestimations toll government took long time include number deaths old people care centers EPHADS.

Do think something similar happening too? Deaths way low way long relative cases, even accounting increased lag diagnosis death improved treatments. desperate cries coming doctors ICUs would also suggest dire situation picture painted &lt;100 deaths day. 

So one can't help wonder statistical acrobatics performed too...  adenovirus vector vaccines come problems. Inactivated vaccines least proven history working. Fianceé probably brought back asymptomatically. think Kansas City Star making up? okay think pretty well now. hope stops soon PARIS — French government's decision impose curfew almost third population prompted cries alarm anger country's ""For us catastrophic,"" Alain Fontaine owner ""Le Mesturet"" bistro said Covid-fighting measures announced Wednesday night. ""It's hard financially hard psychologically...We cannot survive this."" Aware phase 2 results, waiting phase 3 phase 2. read paper stratification typically used phase 2 percentages reliable. really not. Sweden even testing, every day report negative deaths. Intensive care numbers falsified keeping elderly out.

They middle pack.  Cases went due summer. virus spread aerosol, masks make almost difference. room infected person was, likely get infected. Inactivated virus vaccines typically require multiple doses tend trigger cellular response, protection weaker lasts shorter and. also slower produce it's, know, inactivated can't multiplicate. Bullshit lies Bullshit, fuck it. Nothing done lockdowns worse MAJORITY Exactly, become likely scenario going forward. coronavirus, corona always going super-cold super-flu, lasting immunity.

Nature care, nature evolved strong immune system right childbearing age. Making offspring early possible, taking care dying 30 perfectly fine far nature concerned. immune system falls dramatically age individuals longer important children.

It time serious discussion about, instance, lockdown winter reopening summer. Many sports already work like this. wish lol that, envy city anything inner ring suburbs equate hour day rush hour traffic commuting. like 3 hours day. Hell, take train equates nearly 3 hours day, round trip. Yeah, I’ll take rotting home option, please. Bullshit Herd immunity American way fight virus. lazy, ineffective, deadly, costly, hurt poor miniorties most.

Yep. We're gonna rich profit. Bullshit really no, measure democracy progress well minorities respected. Bullshit Bullshit, world full hypochondriacs seeking disability payments. bullshit! 16.10.2020, 00:00 Uhr (online aktualisiert um 08:00 Uhr) difference deny pandemic tried fight it, unlike US president. I'm sure Ireland follow soon. Pubs Dublin closed since March probably stay closed forseeable future. I'm even sure pubs surviving. know regular pub surviving everyone helping gofundme starts running dry obviously every month donations get less. 

Numbers also increasing significantly although per capita numbers still better Northern Ireland. think another lockdown come well relatively soon cannot see risking cases getting high December lockdown December right holidays. believe I’m one people couldn’t get test first time second time took two months even still tested positive amazingly! Second time almost killed I’m young healthy Fuck Fauci. still considered expert? 145k USA. Yesterday US 66k.
For local comparison :
It would 80k Brazil. Yesterday Brazil 29k.
And something Europe:
It would 25k France. Yesterday France 30k.
.
In summary , worse US Brazil bad France. Wow getting crazy Europe. Scary. needs many outweigh needs whatever? Or, whole world could go lockdown time two months, would extinct New Years.

And hundreds millions people starve think appreciate much public likes approves course action. 

Give another six months another two three lockdowns things treatment available soon, we'll open.

You **hope** treatment soon yes things change “beat” thing many times realise can’t. already know possible factor might get lasting immunity, life virus blocks secretion type 1 interferons, initiates extreme immune dysfunction seen disease first place, may also impact able lasting immune response... easily avoided using whole live virus (this rules live attenuated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine) Laughs Czech 10k/day 10 Million people also interest able move personnel around world safely. DoD means keeping Boeing afloat. flight data, travel data, market data, movie theater data proven virus control. somehow still believe lying, essentialy believe faked data tell lie. Sir, must twisted mind. didn’t realise wasn’t US didn’t matter. suppose it’s developing countries it’s sight mind huh scenario someone actually managed get test first wave, virus samples sequenced get sick different strain unlikely number confirmed reinfections top massive iceberg. Even thread, several people anecdotal evidence reinfections list.

All pray immunity vaccine lasts longer massive problem. committed crime.

Don't need commit crime suffer punishment. say since affect breathing, sweat cause bacteria mask everyone keeps distance okay-ish.

To clarify things: talk breathing mean breathing heavy load heavy cardio. mean breathe mask. you´re high duty exercises easily breathe mask training. regularly train mask breathing problems whatsoever. People running marathons mask disprove sh\*theads say can´t beathe mask. matter getting used it.

About batceria mask. Yes, whenever sweat get bacteria - mask literally everywhere body. Thats usually shower sweat. take seperate mask training, wash face mask you´re okay.

If look around gym, 95% people could comfortably wear mask things do. Even lift 1RM take mask lift put again. Wear damn mask! Hell hath fury like doctor scorned. Less Vitamin winter well. seems low Vitamin level good indicator likely symptoms Covid. almost goes +2k daily average ridiculous. Quit giving people false hope best scenario media. Tell people it’s bad isn’t. Even intelligent among us trying get us wear masks rose-colored glasses. creates ammunition ignorant things don’t come true. salesman. promise deliver. mantra. Nope, that's long active antibodies stick around system. immune system's memory B cells retain template making antibodies quickly, stick around decades time. 

The real concern fast virus mutates. good news coronaviruses tend slowly. ""proofreader"" enzyme attempts stop DNA alterations. still see changes eventually trigger memory immune system response. Politics Vaccine**  Redfield told Senate committee Wednesday (September 16) vaccine would widely available middle next year. Mr. Trump said top public health official “made mistake” vaccines would go “to general public immediately.”  president incorrect: Scientists, companies federal officials say people won’t get vaccine well next year, even best-case scenario.  distribution plan bogus politicized. 

There nothing distribute, anything distribute quite time, ever. Trump rush build bridge nowhere. Hold Fox News Corp criminally liable reckless endangerment . US even highest rate beds per capita last comment exactly gym necessary. Obesity easily tackled without exercise all. people obese easily sign fun group exercise classes online go walk jog. personally motivated outside gym ever gym. totally unnecessary. many options there, would take risk. push outside gym too. many ways push increasing eight. Although still done home... let assure obese people would benefit dumbbells. Many online live classes take, even crossfit type classes, use body weight, enough. increase number push ups do. variety different exercises get body guessing time. get motivated running longer longer distances outside. also lot online workout challenges different sorts different studios, challenge show certain number days.

The last place obese people right gym, likely catch covid. get fit healthy easily outside gym, even hiring virtual fitness coach free.YouTube workout videos. know America would bad

The US would done fine. world without Trump, government would taken ""better prepared not"" position. Masks would sent out, quarantine recommendations made, etc. Unfortunately, President decided politicize pandemic attempt polarize nation re-election chances, are. anyone tell matters whether matters whether ethanol isopropyl? whether one superior other? able locate info searching yet.

I'm 20 second hand scrub work, much eye-rolling, chuckling, head shaking many co workers, impatience management. Sometimes can't get sink need to. I'd like know next-best thing. Excuse neighbor, help notice picked flowers... salt earth nothing could ever grow again? best prepared nations always island nations. New Zealand, Taiwan anywhere easy close travel. Trust me, learned Plague Inc.  Good setting plans now. Actually yes, I'm alluding post. People see virus collective problem one every individual supposed decide themselves. Ex. ""If want wear mask get sick that's choice."" 

A lot people betrayed age misreading post going american exceptionalism. per day? Seems crazy high. probably thinking 7 14 day total, would still crazy high, bit less crazy. ""The arc moral universe long, bends toward justice” found Google AMP links comment. normal links:

Lol! think you’re interested virtue signaling pragmatic solutions. Everyone agrees SK method would better. what? continuing yell help? Korea didn’t 10s millions cases, don’t population doesn’t give fuck. do. can’t solution. need viable solution hyper messy, non-compliant, massive diverse country community spread. Pretending small, monoethnic, monocultural, highly compliant country without community spread foolish actively harmful. Additionally, lot easier dictator impose rule law democracy.

Bye kiddo Never understand power stupidity, greed narcissism. still plenty people tell everything fine you’re alarmist wearing mask. 


Those people bring guns grocery store, enough ammunition stock gun store. yeah everything fine. one idea much longer last. I’d argue that’s culture based they’re authoritarian, mask wearing social norm Covid Agreed. Hopefully someone involved point support changing system get rid FPTP I’d argue that’s culture based they’re authoritarian, mask wearing social norm COVID Focusing US obscures larger picture plot relationship JHU rankings actual cases, correlation zero!

I [did quick took top 100 JHU ranked countries ranked according current Worldometer Cases/M Deaths/M. Bottom left countries expected well well (Australia, Thailand, Latvia, SK, Malaysia Japan). Top Right countries expected poorly poorly (Qatar, Bahrain Moldova). 

More interesting top left countries expected well (US, Netherlands, France, Spain, Belgium, Brazil, Argentina). bottom right countries expect well (Uruguay, Ethiopia, Bhutan, Madagascar, Egypt, Cambodia, Sierra Leone, Zimbabwe, Senegal &amp; Nigeria). 

But amazing thing rankings overall actually perform better literally mixed countries random, graph looks like random noise (slope -0.098 R^2 0.01)! 

Correlations additive! Either JHU managed find set metrices perfectly anti-correlated (vanishingly unlikely) every metric considered relationship whatsoever actual pandemic preparedness (at least, measured reported cases). correlation reported deaths sliiiightly better 0.05 slope also markedly negative (ie: worse JHU expected country do, better actually did). ironically perpetuated people ""pro life"", willing reject every norm we've ever politics chance telling women bodies. even ironic since also saying ""my body, choice"" respect masks. Im pro shutting universities. students less need guidance. need parents stay home care us. also huge percentage use public transportation. give us online classes ffs.

The rest: keep open. cant closed longer. Maybe Trump ignore court order agree with. Maybe forget courts legislatures altogether let single person make decisions. Labor Day infections spreading = exponential growth. prepared"" list author also soul searching

You mean like top comment thread bashes America doing?

Redditors fucking stupid painful. claimed “What plan?” first surge go away? think thinking maybe along lines US actual contingency plan pandemic like this. Trump Administration ignored threw window. followed, would prevented lot crap going even numbers lower Germany. needed crisis keep office care got screwed long got wanted. That's someone cares country. He's never actual president. He's awful joke. ole sleezy, good nothing, businessman always best skills crappy lies boasting try make look good. doesn't. makes look like idiot actually is. Also I'd like point experts literally said February-March nothing 2-3 MILLION Americans would die estimated EVEN EVERYTHING RIGHT 100k-200k could still die. REGULAR ASS FLU KILLS 50-60K YEARS NEVER TALKED LEVEL. Thank posting pre-print. it, also check ""The Great Hack"", also Netflix. Great Hack tells happened, Social Dilemma shows why. want go hat-trick, check ""Feels Good Man"" (not Netflix, VOD only). dont want read opinions people reddit. Go read academic articles. People allowed CHOOSE wanted follow CDC guidelines. know answer Simple..our fearless Leader blame.. Remember not-so famous words ? It'll go away.. never said waste time, CUMSLUT power giving shit anyone themselves. *eyeroll* lungs damaged cry. they’ll dead. shouldn’t forget put “Murica” “Muh Freedums” well. I'm saying countries actively try pretend away virus like we've done states want ok, also.

Thank I'm afraid people probably end getting virus point, case best healthy can.

I'm everything get virus. I'm also eating healthy taking zinc vitamin D. case...  never said was. Federal government still tremendous amount wealth benefit dollar world's premier reserve currency. Federal government could used resources provide way Americans did. 2016 global healTh secuRity biodefense Unit responsible pandeMic Preparedness fired reason. Weird. study back, recall answer let toss couple.

smokers die younger. covid kills older. bad covid outcomes population smokers would lower general population. realistically speaking studies consider population hospitalized covid patients different general population. there's going 20% people 18 40% 18-55 whatever, mainly seniors. what's smoking rate, especially consider smoking bans nursing homes I'm saying waste time without alternatives, DICKWEED 'standard' timeline seems 5 days infection symptoms begin, people test positive day 2 (and infectious days 3-6), many variables consider, always day two (it seems linked onset symptoms much date exposure, takes 20+ days symptoms start also take longer test positive). PPE crisis far solved, sadly. us working almost care facilities dealing it. Sad go hear across pond thing us UK 

At least hospitals seen better equipped knows long last Well suppose could work branches Government come policy, would require actually communicating working others opposed slapping gavel want she'll probably nothing seem like doom number all. Winter ends March, right, actually seems like something low ball number IMO. recall, Cuomo’s solutions March involved telling citizens give fear (sound familiar?), advising continue riding subways keep businesses open. New York’s unique solution able get people infected anywhere else America, high levels subsequent immunity bringing number cases down. Hey, come on, hard anyone focus bullet holes feet. Yeah guess better shot Exactly. People really eager someone blame though. So...you're saying hold political rally thousands people? Or...what? I'm confused. John Ionaddis estimates average across world We’re best prepared war preventing financial ruin. Sadly, we’re best prepared virus. However, learn quickly ready next one. Hopefully. How. Yeah, sit down, got story you. wasn't. Hell No. Untested vaccine? First round? I’ll wait 3.1 version thank you. anti vaxer cautious. say that, (and yeah, true extent) like anti mask people would listen female president

The problems run deeper Reality shows best prepared. pandemic response failure. Worse, making effort correct weaknesses pandemic identified systems. Thank commenting. need advice get time background science. time want chime tell us anything think need know, one would grateful. happy cake day. OP post bot farm political actor. Look many posts Per day. Everyone reading this.. mods little help here?? I'm guessing I'd guess least 50% subreddits subscribers US. means upvotes always drown ours. probably EU people gave subreddit up.

Also pretty sure see EU activity soon, second wave hits EU states again. Lombardy almost double population second populated region. 10 millions vs 6. confusing case fatality rate infection fatality rate. assumption catch every infection, Seroprovalance studies said otherwise. incredibly uninformed think IFR 3% point. used federalism US big make sense take precautions NYC bumfuck Alaska.

Shouldn't looking within US preformed worst? get always goes top let's look things objectively here. Trump daily briefings weeks, lack information given public stuff. people complying. need fine daylights 25% people wont even wear mask simplest things get contained vaccine.

""Natural Herd Immunity"" another name mass murder. We're mass murder. yet, im university student studying theory heavy degree. classes except one presencial, 4 madatory attendance. absolute shit show. Around 40% kids dont wear masks outside classroom groups. mad. Fine, changes tomorrow? realistic, moralistic. Greedy Old Pussies too. Tbh think many got/get sick non American post overrun comments USA either Americans otherwise. fucking boring constant comparisons. imagine there's eu centric covid sub somewhere hopefully less comparisons actual debate discussion lol eloquent fair enough response.

My hope people see sooner later road opt real change empty promises change. No, using benchmark others pushups home, dumbass. Thank you. I’m worried this. high school sports seem bad enough based videos I’ve seen online, looks like AAU sports straight reckless. least high school sports trying take precautions. robust social net. never prepared. Totally Raucous Unprecedented Murky Phenomenon. Unfortunately neither completely random unpredictable. really unconceiveable. country full people vehemently distrust authority. Short full Chinese military squads roaming streets literally physically sealing people homes welding doors shut, going large amount non-compliance. would mattered one iota whether Hillary, Biden, anyone else, President. Yeah I’ve heard virologists epidemiologists say it’s much better talk terms various potential scenarios rather model.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* terrible health care system country has. also capacity hospitals. 

It also lack states job trying contain virus. actually happens now? potential gathering restrictions become law enforced? Sorry stupid questions, I'm knowledgeable whole process Whitmer's powers stripped They’re now, anyway. Though shown certain point, affects personally, Republican politicians voters fact change tune. Unfortunately occurs lots people die.

For example, look Chris Christie. Spent 7 days ICU mask mandates. Stupid comment People die, followed people caused needless deaths deny deaths occurred due covid. It’s M.O. almost entire pandemic. help virus highly variable spread -- people infect one, people infect dozens even hundreds people. problem complacency, luck. Yikes. disagreeing you, he's adding another data point. probably genetic factor we'll look back retrospect go ""oh, trait 5x likely get long covid"" etc right small sample size. youre full fo shit expect communism that's getting at. young people want either. want something like western European-style socialism that's I'd expect see next wave. say that? video? Biden basically said Trump racist closing travel China couple weeks Trump talked Coronavirus State Union speech. Biden's twitter account. Great work. Koreans proud themselves. answer politics, thing sub pretends nothing virus. So, can't talk it. ones talk still think media blowing proportion leader didnt set good example put forth information.

In fact downplayed people ate up.

Thus essentially killed 250k people. end day people obviously want activities understand risk, no? don’t want leave house don’t..? Businesses choose operating capacity mask requirements, consumers choose shop level risk accept. personally staying home laying low, doesn’t bother really others living lives. end day control actions, seeing thing happen world unless it’s island nation ruled dictator type governments part. I'm confused still question asked. accurately answered since February. sub control probably CCP, pretty obvious sub created. Yes, ""right"" ""protest"" that's ""really matters"".

Can't call national guard fuck losers, throw trucks lock Guantánamo pandemic ends? joke, Vitamin Zinc known documented immuno-modulators. There's reason zinc many counter cold medicines. Observational data shows people deficient Vitamin Zinc twice likely seriously ill die. pilot study Spain randomized double blind studying effects Calcifidiol (Vitamin analogue) given hospitalized Covid patients showed greatly reduced risk serious illness death 2% given Vitamin going need ICU care **50%** given went require ICU care. I’ve done thing. thread own. I’ve addressed catastrophe China. Fucking terrible China. Irresponsible lying China starting another pandemic. testing expanded. idea got downvoted both. both. both. both. both.


Are done yet? 

It's both. blame both. blame both. 


Get it? good? 

Both fault. fault. fault. 


Am getting yet Wow specifically masks work French company know specific details, understanding employer onsite cafeteria, must provide employees discounted Restaurant Tickets used daily week restaurants grocery stores. Apparently gov somehow subsidizes part this. think 19euro voucher costs employee less half. caught. Best prepared nation, joking dumb people told execute plan sent gallows Good tyrant. Fuck unconstitutional bullshit. can't hide god damn respiratory airborne virus chimps... Please civil. love rhetorical redundant questions. Luckily soon weekend. 

The Obama administration literally created left NSC pandemic response playbook scrapped administration, Republican leadership (of course) chose lie about. Everyone, make sure vote. US world‘s best prepared nation confront pandemic (...)

BWAHAHAHAHAHA

Never change, r/coronavirus. Yes. Yes do. I'm sorry changed topic thread refuse address catastrophe leadership. Good luck! I'm sure there, back bar hopping days nightlife really get started around 11pm. people drink end day crowds concern. Trump tossed away Pandemic Response Team handbook put place eventuality.All done President Obama.He terrified man done everything erase put inplace President Obama. Ignoring simple mask wearing=Trump...But totally useless… serve ‘bad’ example. agree, there's discussion sub. confirmation bias. neighbor north here. Look happened Governor. con. 

Yes, stronger country wanted war, got war. 

It got war deceiving public propaganda. got war deceiving allies fake intelligence. got war deceiving entire world. call believe righteous really care invaded nations. 

People believe righteous due suffering amnesia. 

Obviously, they're literally suffering amnesia. They're incredibly Chinese nationals brush Uyghur detention. 

Not remotely suffer it. benefit directly it. 

Uighurs benefit all. think terrorists targeted Han Chinese? Uighurs victims strong arm government top that, one going care. ones might care would think better acting care get smeared unpatriotic terrorist sympathizers. 

Except righteous Westerners *really really care* Uighur Chinese strongest nations earth right now. 

There's nothing scary it. good US finally country balance looking forward future either them, climate change resource scarcity breathing necks. 

Be glad China war hungry like US. glad US greatest threat world finally challenger balance out. Number 1 world again!  built Mercedes. gave keys psychotic, idiot uncle. Trump. Facui's prediction 100k new cases day soon come true. announcement says new rules run one month, whereafter evaluation follow.

It also says everyone Belgium allowed one cuddle contact. COVID per1 million GOP/Democratic partisianship. Unless color BLIND, pretty DAMN clear WANTS DIE doesn't. Tell GOP holds sanctity life value? Yes- U.S. good job Swine Flu. That’s proof didn’t need masks PPE depleted... Jenny Karen good friends. That's one reasons, also foresaw social darwinsm lead eugenics later holocaust, probably main reason guy still deeply religious society time. 

I readings propose remembering classes got college way back then, remember talked lot letters towards end life long they're room physically “The mask-wearing order expands Denver’s order requiring face coverings indoor settings. Organized athletic programming — like college high school sports, well organized youth adult leagues — exempt expanded order. People also exempt.

The order effect immediately indefinitely.

Organized athletics exempt expanded gathering order, pick-up games unorganized park athletics not. Restaurants still allowed seat tables 10 people, city officials said, strict guidelines adhere to.

The announcement comes coronavirus cases hospitalizations [rising Denver across Health officials sounding alarm, saying trajectory isn’t altered hospitals could eventually overwhelmed. 

Gov. Jared Polis Friday estimated 1 every 260 Coloradans coronavirus contagious.” depends though, countries like Germany it‘s impossible close borders call day. Nations New Zealand Limited Access anyways easier time keeping infected people out, course also great job inside country.  measure failure? percentage death rates hospital

is percentage death rate hospital, percentage sick-with-covid resulting death general population. 

Your idea Americans go hospital cause they're afraid bills, also go healthcare system less prepared places. 

If case, clearly higher percentage sick Americans would end dead since less us visit doctor get shittier care Swedes do, **yet** numbers showing twice likely die Covid sick Swede American, there's nothing support point American privatized shitty healthcare system killing people higher rate systems - anything, data showing contrary. Ever think ya’ll didn’t plan belief unfounded? Donald Trump didn’t infect kill 250,000 people... moronic countrymen did. Further, healthcare system employment systems proved worst first world. systems made least prepared showed. Obviously still going consequences due fact worldwide scale. can't avoided entirely, ***is*** entirely government's fault got bad did. regulations, borders closed, would far better off. look New Zealand, South Korea, hell even China better government response did, virtually gone places. options Trump chose wrong ones. Hospitalizations also up, testing flu vaccines

Which limited efficacy compulsory. fact vaccines *baked into* 60,000+ number. Vaccines supposed evaluated effects, sake dosent kill 200,000 + people.

Okay, 200,000 cutoff? Coronavirus topping 180,000, we'd dosent swamp ask, acceptable circumstances bars open, terms infectious disease death? Agree! Gang mentality two party system. far right underplayed pandemic far left overplayed it. manageable situation neither Democrats Republicans ever come compromise. One always win, people stuck middle end collateral damage little gang war. last time gave relief months ago allot people still jobs relief agreed upon. relief agreed upon pay corporations lobbied congress. division parties creates extremists sides. wear mask try prosecute taking eat. something call 'ticket restaurant' (restaurant bills). companies (not many) workers can't go home eat give tickets restaurant (edit: paid half company half employee). pay lunch restaurant buy food supermarkets.

and company tax reductions. way gov subsidizes it.  Thanks mate! hope anyone dies, unfortunately, virus hard old vulnerable people keeping young healthy people locked actually makes worse...this problem, see wanna play politics... US simply never world’s best prepared nation. developed nation lacking proper state aided healthcare, something kind important pandemic... knew months ago data Remdesivir promising, Gilead friends high places. one point, [the NIH's COVID-19 Treatment Panel 9 50 members disclose financial conflicts Gilead, though 7 Trump Christie making sure mention Remdesivir, even though likely monoclonal antibody treatments along Vitamin Zinc steroids received important recoveries. money Gilead greased right academic, public health, political palms. Thank expressing gratitude OP. sums feelings pretty well. 👍🏻 do....except packing restaurants, work house parties. lol NBA excellent job controlling stopping spread covid. know how? listened medical experts, quarantined entire program, rapid tests contact tracing, eliminated covid within bubble. 

A fucking sports program controlled covid. US government even tried. 

Hilarious/depressing sports example aside, many countries around world contained controlled covid- S. Korea, Hawaii, New Zealand, Australia, CONTINENT Africa, etc. list goes on. 

The US control covid, US following medical advice, leadership (trump down) lying public since January, trump number one spreader covid lies misinformation. 

That's main reason, plan trump, except herd immunity NEVER successfully used control virus. Vaccines populations use vaccines herd immunity works. US would sacrificing 2-6 million essential workers- doctors, nurses, teachers, elderly (your parents, grandparents, neighbors, kids immunocompromised systems) covid. 

If horrified trumps ""plan"" looking telling US citizens u/v8jet. n95 mask

Specific mask link? Neighbors. Watching kind post really insulting intelligence.

They're talking like underdeveloped countries ability track casualties. Jesus Christ. tragedies 1000x worse going everywhere world time, expect take time day feel sorry still living, breathing person whole life ahead them? Give fucking break. 

The mods correctly removed post low-quality. u prioritize economy think people ignore deaths fellow citizen. Yeah IHME model way predictions start. country must go back days unions. 

These people need protections independent contractors. Many companies many industries labeling people contractors avoid costs liabilities associated employees.

They call gigs. Bullshit. They're employee positions. 

It must stop.

Condolences families. make sense pick countries comparison. distribution plan, make sense, given daunting logistics. However, still understand going keep vaccine -90F degrees. (The J&amp;J requires normal refrigeratation.) sure downvoted, 100% correct. stats draw conclusions %positive tests, hospitalisations, ICU cases deaths. New cases pretty much useless data given much testing varies time countries. people understand individual states power implement covid restrictions?

Because also President telling everyone party undermine restrictions. That's actually happened. That's massively failed covid.  “any sort face protection nose mount” look this. joke. ""They admit ""officially"" never happened"". ""Internal emails count"". Literally. *Admitting*. crime. ""Doesn't count"". made Fantastic denialist logic, Putin would proud. worse, Bagdad Bob levels denial.

So claiming secret underground government organisation executing herd immunity policy, dark, official published policy.

Please explain envision secret stratergy carried out.

.. name single country strategy worked? I.e lockdown zero cases, control levels contact tracing masks exactly 90% Europe done Sure. Sure. But, case illness. don't, least generally cater public health policy based anecdotal evidence small minute group. certainly tragic man change numbers stated above. 

I stated 3 months ago. children die school buses year died COVID. 3 months later, still true. But, told students take school bus. many statistics mentioned I'm still blown away interpretation information. Something something exponential growth gotta lamest dude I’ve ever met /u/blazingsaint It’s less closer 2 times higher risk dying COVID seasonal flu (0.1% infected) u dig though data u find believe infection fatality rate actually 0.2% New Zealand. Much easier isolate remote island! laughed seeing title. No, US best prepared country world tackle Coronavirus, even close. 

The US insurance payments system complete mess long, long time. Insurance still tied employment, people laid longer health insurance. 70 years WW2, US still can't change this. 

American culture never good comes following health guidelines government. Americans eaten obesity, Americans still opioid epidemic, Americans ones refuse wear masks ave used unemployment time money party protest.

You see angry anti-mask wearing YouTube videos coming Korea, Japan Germany. state healthcare means never world's best prepared nation. Americans Prosperity budget proposal 2018 (a Koch think tank) proposed slashing millions. needs many outweigh needs something. right tell people protect protect others, especially high risk like me. absolute worst outcome death, second worst outcome getting infected needing inpatient medical care. believe me, admitted real case pneumonia _sucks balls hardcore_, coronavirus not. there, done that, multiple times. realize right quick fragile lungs they're close giving out... would wish possibility death asphyxiation enemies - I'd least make quick them.

Those 40 risk factors bad outcome need taking protection seriously. long thing -- we're already almost year waves outbreaks, susceptible pool hosts dwindling. Take masking social distancing seriously, seriously consider obtaining filtering facepiece respirators KN95, KN94, FFP2 N95 devices -- likes increasing availability every week. reality infection control even aerosol transmission viruses hard, take seriously let guard down. pathetic lack imagination. said cause reply purely rebuttal concessions given took interested expressing side listening all. hopefully I’m wrong I’ll give better explanation time around! 

I think misinterpreted “fuck elderly” statement mean that’s thought did. No, know drastic changes made. saying WOULD bad that. (Sorry shouting, can’t italicize mobile). 

Cases children COVID die rate 0.15% according aap.org 0.00002% according CDC report. Regardless number, point wanted make let virus run rampant would equal straight sacrificing percentage children country. death rate rises every generation them. That’s lot sacrifices, especially since immunity isn’t lifelong surviving. realize people made forced make sacrifices mitigation attempts, it’s important see sacrifices sides. 

It would interesting debate important: living jobs, potentially dead die. valid arguments. However current moral culture set prioritize literal lives individuals, much prioritizing property wealth protecting slipping poverty. 

Your airport argument critical flaw. there’s 0.0001% chance terrorist shoe bomb, probability doesn’t change much matter do. It’s already small many people terrorists. doesn’t go much. COVID though, it’s virus, you’re taking preventative measures spread like wildfire. terms comparison, would like every person shoe bomb. Check simulations published numerous reputable news sources back March. takes little time without prevention COVID spread entire population, 100% people. 

Basically, option guaranteed deaths millions hospitalization millions one hand, we’re hopefully less million deaths financial emotional struggles survivors. 

But kicker you’re ALSO guaranteed financial emotional struggles first situation too, it’s starts happening later. Instead immediate proactive response, happen everyone dead family members, dead parents, dead children, dead coworkers, on. get real burden economy strain due loss workers emotional trauma entire country losing loved ones time. could easily provided sources would support claim without making declaration less readable.

There might truth side effects lockdown. still doesn’t mean proposing best alternative. really want taken seriously, scientific research trying dictate public health policies best. naming people think like carry weight whatsoever context.

Using Galileo’s name like go everything fought lifetime. never asked believed opinions.

What asserted without evidence, dismissed without evidence.  caused incompetent FHM going herd immunity

and lying ... Deflating projections, usual. lose health insurance Feb. really hope prevent able get vaccination become readily available. Noticed handing samples Costco, least trying. saw poor employees imploring people take sample everyone acting like crazy offer gave wide berth. Might well cut % see half more. many wear correcrly dont cover nose, mouth. many wear thinnest material find. many cross contaminate constantly touching it. many tear crumple putting pocket later. sad. say maybe 30% right. need 85% right, 30% 60% see. We're screwed. backpacking Vietnam. a/c's? 

Its freaking loaded. Lock shit month.

Quarantine anyone coming country after.

Problem fucking solved.  tests March, estimated France 100k day lockdown. Imho unwilling less adapt. work home encouraged? First wave screwed us March till may.

Second wave hits October, time till may.

Its gonna bumpy ride. Aha trolling, got it. people would stay home, would stop.

They won't, going stop, lots people going die. That's go 2 one reason Sweden large initial outbreak stockholmers spending spring vacation Alps Italian outbreak started

If Alps Sweden would fine. travelers brought corona virus Sweden. thanks successful infection tracing, never became widespread. Instead, virus crept Yep, eventually will, vaccine expected needed annually effective like flu shot, even lucky don’t get get eventually. possible everyone get 10+ times lifetime like flu. people use mobile phones washrooms. Trier

What? Trier one beautiful german city say. 

Amazing theres many ""new"" cities US. born 1980 1994. someone latter end years rather beginning, us 40. Furthermore, know lot millennials tried online dating millennials, 40 year olds know good jobs level (homeowner, lots savings, etc) parents similar age pains multi level irony completely lost him. guess Trump right one thing: warm sun helps. ⛅

At least AZ, (and still is) brutal summer. Winter nice cold, freezing like country. Surely Taiwan using relatively unreliable antigen test border?

Surely not? I’m sorry happened you! Sad true. Updating guideline based evidence collected. crazy thing, thought this??? let here:

""Lockdown Skeptics hosting AMA Dr. Jay Bhattacharya, Professor Medicine Stanford University, Director Stanford Center Demography Economics Health Aging, one three co-signers Great Barrington Declaration.""

This saturday.

I thought ask questions understand/challenge viewpoints.  Yes that’s study public health. event 201 discussion old news now. thought looked bit funny wrote it. less build upon. proof handle still can't see... takes ""wearing"" mask. takes wearing right. takes distancing STILL (people think masks mean get closer.) list goes on. Sad. particularly local pattern hardly generalisable deadliness experience 2nd wave. (Poor compliance definitely thing led worse results that's somewhat distinct story)

The mandatory masks introduced first time SF 2nd, deadlier wave Spanish flu. analogy made San Fran Covid map neatly bigger picture Spanish flu  Yes was. video Director General World Health Organization Feb 11 informing closed press briefing Geneva coronavirus airborne dangerous Ebola. Secondly Trump admitted Town Hall debate tonight knew airborne January. Thirdly staff local Walgreens told told pull sanitizer shelves allowed sell it. can't see going well. need less hours general, reducing hours per shift increase amount days spend work. wtf happened Czechia? 

They darlings whole ""masks4all"" movement back like March. Steps 6 7 wrong.

Basically ALU heart Boolean stuff math.

Pretty nasty small piece engineering. Simple complete. Meanwhile Trump McConnell blocking $1.8 trillion stimulus package would address problems concerned with.

The poor starving getting sick crisis politicians looking wealthy expense underprivileged. Yes. We're know starting see real numbers might especially if, like 2000, election still decided yet. one most...unfortunate...family gatherings we've ever had. far.

this time, could double drama covid mix. plus- half people 1/3 i.q. masking up. try math that. Italy's going again, particularly Lombardy, infections 2000/day. Again, actions ti prevent another lockdown similiar actions. Schools open, bar, restaurants stuff untouched. Nothing wrote false. would think that? Yeah ain’t happening. mean say walked lab Moscow ask one, would get phase 3 test subjects get it.

Medical workers across country also could get it.

There production scale problems - (russian source, details) UI iPhone literally bis work decades engineering. That's five year old use it. kind terrible parents don’t believe vaccines? dunno, there’s extremes ends. wouldn’t volunteer child flip side problem letting get one it’s FDA approved deemed safe.  Vietnam cities littered AC, even lot European cities. thinking rural Vietnam, many people live now. 

It's true lot central heat though. caught COVID Costco March waiting line 2 hours maskless social distancing pre-SIP. shutdown needed stock everything.  I’m still dealing longhauler symptoms. Sumerian guy said same? Everybody poor go anywhere might work. Meh ...

That basically saying everything better past.

But things better things grew considerably complex many ways.

We information age desperately need find way manage distribute ever complex knowledge enormous amounts information. Well, actually I’d say entire article misleading.

1) article mentions “top epidemiologists” particular group represents consensus opinion expert epidemiologists, fact opposite true—they represent minority opinion. 

2) It’s misleading article suggest “joined” epidemiologists. formal endorsement epidemiologists’ position, two groups actually fundamentally different views manage pandemic. epidemiologists question promote returning life normal nonvulnerable populations, isolating vulnerable, allowing virus spread population—essentially herd immunity strategy. hand promotes taking robust actions suppress virus wherever possible. fact, whole point lockdowns *are* costly become necessary virus gets control. Therefore, countries need take robust preemptive action suppress virus testing, contact tracing, isolation, face coverings, etc. virus become widespread lockdowns become necessary. interview Dr. Nabarro’s quote taken, points relative success certain Asian countries well Germany Canada controlling virus way. would recommend watching full interview Dr. Nabarro.

3) article seems suggest new position WHO. reality, held position described several months now.

4) article essentially tries portray endorsement herd immunity strategy, i.e. give let virus run it’s course. It’s telling article’s author never mentions WHO’s suggestion countries aim suppress virus wherever possible. mention WHO’s director explicitly rejected herd immunity approach earlier week.

Overall seems like using particular quote co-opt WHO’s name authority order argue public health strategies promotes. reeks dishonesty bad faith. Thanks! 

Is 鼻咽試紙採檢 PCR test rapid antigen test? remember original report talking Ct values means PCR test. I'm assuming 深喉唾液檢驗 throat swab PCR test? could false positive could simply caught tail end disease also makes sense given timing symptom presentation.

If tested positive PCR, even weak levels, question still positive result coming from? Either there's contamination Taiwan lab, big deal. caught point Taiwan China, means still someone point gave caught via testing yet. cAnT JuMpInG jAcKs? think actually happened. faith somewhat restored. 😀 Wow wonder could stupid?!

*looks half US* think use American missiles US base services them. Covid-19, us, let us know cool get back normal. Witch! “For Strength Herd Bison, Strength Bison Herd.” curious: sub allow links worldometer whatever title want, still allowing links say politico without mod approval? one times I'm glad nurse. chances modern vaccine causing actual harm incredibly thin. wonder they're going year two fear wears still refusing ease travel restrictions. think we're sick winning, literally... govt chose profits people.  
And lost both.  
Unbelievable amount cope. That's actually plot ""DECAMERONE"" Giovanni Boccaccio Glad ok No. all. Reading article shows CDC's problems caused political interference Trump days earlier, Butler team suddenly found President Donald Trump’s front burner president began publicly agitating churches Butler’s team rejected conflicted CDC research, including worrisome suggestion delete line urged congregations “consider suspending least decreasing” use next day, furious call came office vice president: White House suggestions optional. CDC’s failure use insubordinate, according emails could agency eradicated smallpox globally wiped polio United States fallen far?

hint: orange seen apolitical bulwark, CDC endured meddling multiple fronts officials little public health experience, Trump’s daughter Ivanka ... 

Need copy more? Ivanka Trump telling CDC do.

Trump failed America world. Trump defunded PREDICT. PREDICT isolated infectious disease every 4 months. defunded two months Covid 19 exploded. PREDICT defunded AMERICAN TRAINED SCIENTISTS could isolated covid-19. China failed. nation world much protect world things like this. world looks like withoug America's leadership. want see lots mental gymnastics check economics sub. turns everything going great nothing wrong. bad news actually good. Well said appreciated. I'll need read keep learning. opening people, like extended families. still forced 2 week quarantine. difficult travel Canada right place stay without going outside 2 weeks enter country. disease like measles, 95% people need vaccinated herd immunity. It’s definitely going different natural covid infection, don’t think know % would take point. start saying need address both. drop tax revenue already hit services head-counts cities states across U.S. Additionally, yes need help without jobs. were/are programs without jobs “right now.” people suffering? Yes. people need help? Yes.

What said, said, true. difference is... money wasn’t used pay city employees, likely would make cut somewhere else, point. trying talk you, please don’t take wrong way: pandemic isn’t over. Every measure we’ve implemented stop-gap. isn’t sustainable, without extreme repercussions. So, hope temporary. hope year things start improving.

CARES / PPP keep people employed. money dries up, job losses roll-in. Look airline industry right now. So, goal help people stay employed help already struggling. remember cost re-staff get city services back previous levels, cut city employees. Add top Las Vegas needs city services right now, less.

Everyone needs money get it. there’s: 1) limited pot, 2) legislation federal system empowers local governments make local decisions. never perfect. way, see eviction moratorium set expire today... there’s places U.S. NEVER one. Las Vegas City Hall ain’t bad. swabbing tests 100% accurate? see get negative another test positive country Belize. symptoms go negative probably flu. Shoot - thought we're talking Securities Exchange Commission. Lots workplace also longer working home. Eh, 


I've reading sub year. reports saying 'might' might verified September. 


We're Mid October trials still going well. Spring 2021 remained realistic possibility average person. 


If get decent vaccine Fall 2021, think I'll okay. played factor. Look stats compliance various public health measures first year vs second year. Famously, San Francisco Anti-Masking-League formed 2nd year pandemic protest reintroduction mandatory mask laws. Yes one family cold either wearing N95 masks entire time. 
(I several used ones laying around bought construction projects 2018. worn twice wearing since March). Lmfao dude smallpox eradicated decades ago. don’t even get vaccinated shit anymore. real. place smallpox virus currently exists CDC lab Atlanta, Georgia lab Russia. That’s literally it.  Nobody knowledgeable ever denied reinfection possibility. Every Coronavirus we've ever studied rate reinfection due everyone's immune system different. argument always rate reinfection probably low enough relevant. Given rarely seeing reinfection, reinfection rate almost certainly 1%, probably 0.1%. 

That sucks 0.X% people get reinfected meaningfully change predicted amount deaths threshold reach natural herd immunity. Didn’t like 30% population get flu shots? campaign never intense...anti smoking campaigns remember, don’t remember anyone ever telling stay home seriously fever KC area spread out. I’d shocked weren’t 8. No, agenda believing February, was, could contain virus prevent spreading U.S. stopped flights China, forgot stop flights Italy.   
The government finally issued [Executive Order Mar 18th. government always police power direct PPE needed it. But, month February, ""downplay"" mode, perhaps protect stock market CDC lost credibility. /s? Think urban explorer videos Disneyworld. France severe cases tested first wave. can't imagine many missed.This one likely last longer though worse.  Spanish flu went all. 1st wave milder illness. commonalities generalisation odd - please read book Spanish flu. one city (Melbourne) that's locked hard. There's minimal virus minimal restrictions rest country. Can’t tell you’re sarcastic no. aren’t well terms case numbers. Herd immunity actual hoax. tiresome Argentina longest lockdown world? lol Walk across

I'm curious lines withe current growth rate virus. going late save likely die given current lack political really slow virus USA. Welcome academia, top field paid Walmart manager. Glad know good time here! think Irish people get thrill somebody enjoys time I'm exception lol US 5th world GNI 15th human development index. go almost highly developed country take pictures really poor parts. US might great free people say is, say it’s becoming newest third world country insane So..... Time panic? Cause I'm getting there. human empathy perspective - right.

From scientific perspective, wrong. wanted doctor. trying toot horn, got straight college. 4.0, took mcat. Life threw curve balls, mom got sick, brother legal trouble. kinda man house plans got put hold. I've often contemplated going back, take another mcat, apply. age money. helping people. seeing anti science many people are, heck want become one? often get ""are doctor"" reply say doing? No, I'm not, matter? listen actual doctors. Grrr. Still people, young old, get long term lung heart damage. stated, contagious. something like Coronavirus affected yourself, wanna take chance, go ahead. fact spreads easily easily make someone severely ill kill problem. can't believe still needs said hard people comprehend. Sooner people become less selfish sooner get control. average salary $60-80k year that’s without bachelors degree. Based patriotpilled mean they're crying freedom theyre keeping everyone else trapped shitty situations unable live normal lives Corporations (largely) operate within limits set law, i.e. society. bit easy point fingers ""them"". failure...active sabotage WH. Traitors all. scientists doctors trust. Edit add:

I trust Fauci. But, don’t trust him, trust JAMA network reports trust week virology podcasts. trust John Campbell honestly report sees he’s learning. trust papers get posted r/COVID-19.

I’ll add links.

[JAMA JAMA week - John data Johns Hopkins overall information reliable. registered newsletter/digest

[Johns Hopkins coronavirus resource scientists trust German virologist Christian Drosten. Much gets reported German though might translate it. 

There many reliable people, handful trust. thinking, *more seriously got sick.


Also, got experimental cocktail, too. making false equivalence. US economy fucked anyone elses metric.

Literally argument every country big lockdowns long term would better places lockdown fully like US. many countries higher per capita daily case rate US shut economies much higher degree. 

The whole point rest world supposed start getting along US would sputtering behind continued infections. Well turns back started now, US seen infection rate stay steady going waiting vaccine anyways. locking nearly politicians suggesting would earlier on. Hell even talks lockdowns could eradicate turned completely untrue.  trick treating effective well fitting masks less menacing due ventilation virus outdoors. house parties haunted houses troubling. seasonal component sure, simple reason: Cold weather makes respiratory system prone infections general. People tend stay indoors lot ventilation automatically worse outdoors. people public transport time, less people walk ride bike longer distances. restaurants, bars, etc. people sit indoors, outdoor spaces. work, noone wants open windows really cold outside, schools. People celebrate birthdays, weddings, etc. indoors instead outdoors. Ya, MBA much fun undergrad. Grades don’t matter, people money, classes joke, jobs plentiful get early program, none undergrad drama immaturity. America rich, cruel. We’ve allowed people get sick, hospitalized, die great numbers, ruling class ideologically disinclined provide direct financial support individuals businesses affected virus. 

But vaccine good economy, bringing back demand now-dormant industries allowing millions return work, ruling class spare little expense rolling out. agree 100%. physical mental health benefits going gym outweigh risks me. obviously something everyone determine themselves.

I'm worried. Extensive precautions taken gym. Everyone required wear mask times. Everyone spaced out, restrictions many people certain areas once. acrylic walls around equipment shielding other. space well-ventillated. Staff members constantly go around wiping equipment. also wipe every piece equipment alcohol use it, users. even disinfect shoes end put gym bag. Narrator: ""They didn't.""

Glad he's okay though. Germany/France/Poland/Benelux/etc longer play stay outside game able nice mild sunny summers weather going trash rain/cold usual season. October - April cold rainy, unless figure something soon, theyre gonna world hurt. I’m convinced Republicans actively trying get people killed point, would make sense Wednesday, Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker warned state's coronavirus data trending ""concerning direction."" IDPH Director Dr. Ngozi Ezike urged residents rethink might celebrate upcoming holidays effort contain spread ""COVID-19 changed way work, live, play, change plan celebrate holidays,"" Ezike said statement. ""While safest way celebrate members household connecting others virtually, know, many, holidays family friends, want provide tips celebrate safer."" think was! Trump could died, still delude (he's good that). week ICU COVID Christie's shape means death imminent would happened time place. Catholic probably given Anointing Sick sacrament, used called Last Rites.

Little hard face facts situation. know notice ""go back"" part. LOL TN status still intact new NAFTA fortunately shit Sherlock.  Umm. University reddit light years ahead tangible degree. wars info fancy book lernin'?  Agreed - small sample size.

But worrying nonetheless. We'll watch carefully.  mind jumping skyscraper really want that. mind dropping people. used feel way, too. learned make 6 figures working less 40 hrs/ week. Masks filtration. I've read several news sites looked reasonably legit got shot June know vaccine placebo.

In way, got vaccine, many got placebo get invested, speaks well efficacy vaccine. sense, great.

For individual always sucks, speedy full recovery! Okay, whatever say bud. Glad know scientific evidence better me. Boy I've sure humbled science knower. wonder people New Zealand stop it? 

I'm jealous much freedom us. terms success progress vaccine? absolutely okay it’s expected happen. 

One person, even few, spinal issues isn’t enough stop vaccine happening. simply isn’t conclusive enough sample size adverse effects statistically negligible. still don’t understand you’re implying don’t matter? Never said even hinted. LOL 

That 100% true. many factors go risk. think clearly see that, lot cases treatment improved. rate deaths rising still concern. mean? Italy things.

They eased period 2 months, progressively tightening lockdown became obvious existing measures insufficient, time came it, still several hundred cases per day.

Progressive escalation work.

Vietnam quarantining entire towns cities single cases. eradication looks like, full force start.

Also, Japan, far worst response East Asian nations systematically lagged behind rest region. numbers severely underassessed due policy limiting testing severe cases, total national testing capacity 20,000 per day. Positivity rates consistently 15-30% range. Nice comment. 

It’s always nice see well thought reasonable response. far many threads. covid19 virus actually mechanism kick things like remdesivir. going theory, always somewhat doubtful, it'd work. said, remdesivir nothing cytokine storm August business booming Sioux Falls many bars still full even slowly close due many getting sick. Lots events happing state still time waster bots fight everyone make mess. sucks, everywhere sub. That's one heck curve except part current testing population 750 million could go far higher. shit really gets skin reddit. “Well get equipment.” assumes every single person lives house garage basement. people living 900 sq ft second floor apartments could somehow feasibly safely set fully stacked barbell rack? It’s asinine.

People also like assume serious weightlifters substitute another sport workout regiment realizing it’s basically thing asking basketball player suck play golf instead. 

I personal risk-assessment decision go back gym last week seven months away. benefits outweigh risks physical mental health deteriorated much. let everyone know immediate friend family spheres decision. wear mask throughout entire workout due diligence times still go public shop, well. I’m still everything minimize risk others.

No biggie end day. Reddit USA centric - is! I’m sorry you’ve go this. must traumatic going work seeing well pandemic itself. work health service (not US) lies govt spread PPE plans infuriating. I’m non clinical role currently could worked home. Distrust staff meant never allowed to. People stealing sanitiser (we got 1cm every bottle one point), training donning doffing procedure focus churning patients maintaining safety staff.

Pride arrogance greed Oh yeah *truly* ridiculous.  understand want understand: lockdown quarantine vulnerable folks (60+, immunocompromised etc) everyone else go back ""normal"", risks public health would affected? underestimated virus quarantine people coming back abroad early days outbreak like SARS. virus spreads super easily people breathing. Good. Many California’s join rally. need reopen economy, shutting business till vaccines new treatments completely insane. negative health impact continuous shut indefinitely already worse virus mass majority people. Shut definitely causing suffering physically mentally people without pre existing conditions already covid. Homelessness, starvation, losing career skills, financial ruin bigger threat people without pre existing conditions compared covid. pretty clear average age dropping therapies improving.

So infected better able survive it. younger people good spreading it.

So end surging case loads climbing fatalities declining fatality rate.

We keep mind CFR Spanish influenza fairly low. mean killer. COVID-19 highly infectious, low fatality rate combined high infection rate results lot deaths.

How try accept real issue, way control people living wall?

#wakethefuckup justmytwocents Respectfully, 2 cents may overvaluation opinion. People Asia using masks 9 months consistently. leaders say right words people listen. stuff people won’t long, stop social distancing accurate. leaders give right message work. FUCKING TRUE DAMMIT. Look earn act trying remove section 230. fucked future. reason Florida’s reported test positivity rates much lower rates calculated Johns Hopkins (5% vs 12%, Florida’s official daily positivity rate defined number people test positive first time among people tested day. **That includes people test negative multiple times different days**, resulting larger pool test results Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center calculation defines daily positivity number people test positive among tested first time, resulting smaller pool test results analyzed. Easy. President Barack Obama prepared us handle pandemics, hurricanes, pretty much every crisis could come direction. Donald Trump, illegitimate president far I’m concerned he’s voted out, basically get rid fucked response directly. vaccine ever side effects became known year years later? Dammit, no! forgetting evil part effort, they're definitely infected unless scrubbing air. really hope there’s consensus building around this. think lot us starting get really frustrated “science data“ bandied seemingly completely ignored actually making policy decisions. Obviously you’re outside closely surrounded others, it’s good common sense wearing mask, you’re there’s one around you, it’s really huge deal. would course advocate you’re going go walk something like that, even don’t wear mask entire day, going come somewhat close quarters people, mask hand. Honestly, things promoted outdoor activities accommodated such, done way. want give people many options possible without dramatically increasing risks. things outdoors translates pretty low risk overall.

We really need nuanced conversations this. need start treating like comprehensive sex education instead abstinence only. course still rules regulations, need stop rhetoric “stay home don’t go anywhere else die”. doesn’t work trying talk teenagers sex, it’s working general public. Again, obviously there’s things mandated, like wearing masks indoors public spaces, simply telling people stay home Dealing crisis have, it’s dealing crisis wish had. meeting people wondering policy responses failing. doesn’t take much put two two together. Everyone plan DONALD TRUMP LITERALLY THREW PANDEMIC GUIDELINES Tegnell simply able admit wrong. would to? one Sweden calling anyway. learned prestigious schools attending one curriculum necessarily advanced say, state school. fact, ways classes easier schools material presented smarter easier understand way. Take Harvard MIT course edx.org see mean. local government done things better communicate severity mandate masks areas results visible compared states haven't. city also troubles crowding particular area frat parties started fining people, problem. agree plenty unintelligent people US, could done FAR better people top news sources downplaying order ""keep people panicking"". would still 5G hoaxers Bill-Gates-tracker-vaccine types like (my area liberal primarily anti-vax origin), numbers would much smaller current administration undermine scientists every step actually got information people transparent willing update new information came out.

I agree people generally gone real lockdowns, less small gatherings, large gatherings (sturgis), mandatory WFH possible, mandatory masks would made big difference say need new innovative personalized plan US different every country. add official daily positivity rate defined number people test positive first time among people tested day. **That includes people test negative multiple times different days**, resulting larger pool test results Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center calculation defines daily positivity number people test positive among tested first time, resulting smaller pool test results analyzed.  It’s herd immunity whether people want not. virus isn’t gonna stopped restrictions make virus surge harder lifted, like what’s happening Europe. way lockdowns continue either, places like California shutting many business unemployment rate already hitting 16% continue go shutting continues. Vaccines new treatment won’t widely available till mid 2021 earliest, continue shutting business easily lead far bigger health crisis due homeless, starvation, mental illness, drug addiction due financial ruin, losing job skills long also devastating many people. Reality countries around world go ignore approach anyway. They’re rough century. Republicans: see! Obama failed! grateful.

That's awesome. 

How's testing neck woods? 

If able to, totally isolating 10 days, getting tested 10th day, self isolating get negative results, think would totally safe. Lmao america best deal pandemic thats hailarious new Orleans still half fucked hurricane like 10 years ago, trust America organize sock drawer let alone w country highly emotional. last almost 12 weeks tough I'm glad we're making through. Especially seeing things exploding Europe. *Cries American* Indefinitely? That's disconcerting choice words. mean indefinitely? One word: Trump plan TRUMPED. money need ro doe everyone knows someone DIRECLTY died corona?

Thats probably point people go... Hmm mayyyybe ots bad lol  Thousands small number, compared reality already is. enforcement? law enforcement onboard ineffective words. epic bro there's not-entirely-clear value judgment dying *with* Covid becomes dying *from* Covid. something 1:1 relationship, treated heart disease like that, we'd total heart disease + covid deaths far exceeding yearly death totals. One word. Trump. comment interesting 🤔🤔🤔 one narrative except 🤔
Which one 🤔 Literally Donald Trump, that's bringing politics non-political topic. lied outset, made plans deal forced too, made difficult states receive aid. Reinfection incrediblely rare point really factor. fired data manager exact reason. refused paint rosey 'we open everything up' picture. come surprise.  don’t think enforced, rely certain degree compliance. longer keep virus bay, learn. Better treatment protocols, better understanding spreads works, doesn’t, prevent spread. We’ve learned great deal last 6 months. Practical things use reduce mortality rates patients, enhance treatment reduce chance long term tissue damage, prevent sequence events leads “long hauler” patient.  Even isn’t vaccine near future, it’s sensible buy time. So, 40 percent America, can't think, read write correctly? 2 million nothing. 

Look per capita death count. utterly failed. It’s inexcusable. economic toll far far worse well. adjust eventually stay long enough. seriously, Americans ridiculously early dinners compared Europe. remember people dinner dining hall slightly late lunch college. dont get this. problem going Greece? thread complete shitshow. mods good job one Easy don’t care one another. Basics think scene lol Yeah nah  One highest death rates world. smoking ? Isn’t Trump taking?  Inconceivable failure??? projected upwards 2 million deaths US beginning 200 something thousand, majority elderly/unhealthy people. Hell lot people country take consideration comparing countries too. wouldn’t call anywhere close inconceivable failure. OK searched ""effectiveness mask virus transmission"" found quite interesting hits. settled question either way, guy outlier claiming ineffective, actually enhance transmission.

No researcher claims common surgical mask, N95 one either, stop transmission. However, there's quite bit evidence reduce quantity droplets emitted inhaled, reduction aerosols (minidroplets). That's nothing.

Yeah, dry virus pass right through. people's droplets aerosols cling outside fabric. long dry virus particle, moisture particle evaporates, remain infectious? think question answered.

Bottom line, masking distancing PANACEAS (who would guessed) pretty surely also WORTHLESS. Circuit breaker, full nationwide lockdown? Passengers wearing masks low risk contracting Covid-19 planes, even packed flights, according recent study Department Defense United Airlines offers new insight safety air travel amid pandemic. Simulating packed plane, researchers placed mannequins—both without masks—around cabin released 280 million particles air, amount would produced around 1,000 coughs, mimic “99.99% particles left interior aircraft within six minutes,” said United Airlines Chief Communication Officer Josh Earnest Politico event announcing results concluded risk masked “virtually nonexistent” signaled “being board aircraft safest indoor public space,” words Earnest. infection genetically sequenced strain virus show infection different strain count proof. 

Most people don't/didn't option, almost certainly massive undercount actual reinfections. Maybe reinfected - can't proven. good ortho worth weight gold, swear god internet (and scientific papers) done mental health treatment GP ever Incompetence top.

As result idea weird months glad one places made 2nd wave. 

It's looking like northern hemisphere banking vaccine approved. 

Keep safe. Yes. that, among reasons, must prepare temper expectations vaccine. enter false sense security end causing *real* second wave. Best angry rednecks seems :/ There's even bee proven cases person asymptomatic times. 

Here's problem though - virus asymptomatic spread.  fuckin sad. kind interospection nonexistent. Lockdowns UK. Tier 3 toughest we'll get close pubs. interesting That’s... painfully accurate actually Fair enough. IMO government equally stupid well, difference propaganda. *Pfizer’s Chief Executive Officer Albert Bourla noted letter posted website filing depended several factors, including data effectiveness may may available late October.*

Basically, moving forward depends data available positive really. mentions one fact covered John Hopkins report Index assesses countries’ health security capabilities across six categories, 34 indicators, 85 car virus. Here, [this](http://dictionary.com) might help.  make sound like killing religious freedom awesome.

It often case two types freedom act prioritize one. Nothing remotely odd this. So.... let infect every one... population 330M, 8.2M infections, 220K dead, multiplying rate US population gives us...

As result idea agreed. need socialist revolution. yep. getting concerning back neighbors hadn;t seen since Labor day. past Sunday one backyard explain partner got exposed family function Labor Day weekend 3 days started showing signs COVID. knew COVID, saw need test. One got fully recovered still suffering lingering effects 6 weeks later. 23 proven cases reinfection proven genetically sequencing infections showing one different strain (so therefore can't remnants first infection). 

That's really, really good proof. Here's BNO tracker dishonest

took awhile, finally applied right label post Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* friends living there. people seem care. Apparently 50% people masks on, life continues normal. Nazis killed 6 million Jews another 30 million Eastern Europe. COVID death toll order too.

A 5% fatality rate Europe? Well that's fucking pathetic, could bashing superspreaders presided disaster topic? every bloody subreddit got fucking fasc.ists moderating them? title make sense. seen reports? build ENTIRE cities pump That's insane Even got actual vaccine mean much vaccines stop getting sick, severity. got mine 10 days 3 weeks stimulus approved checks started going (I figure file non-filer lot harder figure beginning this). 23 worldwide, almost certainly massive undercount. 

To proven, genetically sequence first strain different strain time (to prove remnants first infection). 

The amount people strain sequenced big.  Therefore, vast majority people gotten reinfected count proven reinfections. /s needed case? countries done really well needed hospitals doctors. realize course don’t need go gym exercise? Overall tested less. harder find realtime figures tests compare. since start : USA 370,055/1million , France 194,594/1 million , Brazil 84,038/1 million , Argentina 51,003/1 million. definitely happens Australia There's foe thousand swords

Takes moment load data. may receive error browser support webgl. Worldmeters showing around 6K people die per day right now. higher 3 weeks.

Recent IFR estimate around .7% Everyone know pro-lockdown also pro-vaccine. Now, anti-lockdown (and may true area similar demographics), not, least say now, feel big deal, less import flu, worth putting vaccines bodies prevent. People wear piece cloth face also seem opposed anything would cause even greater level minor discomfort order prevent spreading catching it. February deaths increased alongside cases do. don't. tell language use. End story. It’s sad doesn’t surprise me. physical chronic illness go undiagnosed ~37 years everyone treated anxiety depression. definitely too, everyone ignored physical problems psychological 🙄 Yeah, Bern well. it’s mandated, people it. Before? much.

It’s clubs, offices private parties gatherings nearly solely responsible infections now. harder control (aside clubs is). /r/Keep_Track Immunity 4 cold-causing coronaviruses lasts 9 months-year people. Home schooling banned Germany well. since going school learning individual subjects. considered expert. expert. one ""what's fat &amp; orange &amp; syphilitic &amp; criminally sociopathic?"" type questions? bot set delete stuff anti-🍊 hurts rep.ublican feelings. Yeah, mandated cantons now. That’s thing Swiss people, don’t wear masks to, it’s requirement, 99% do. barely see people without masks shops public transport. 

Now it’s time advocate either home office masks office. We’ve uni month anyway, offices? 

Also, clubs need close like yesterday, amount cases people quarantine insane.

The problem private gatherings parties. Unlike offices, shops, clubs, bars public transport, enforcing measures extremely hard there. Good time sit home spend 6 8 hours inside VR away craziness. problem told hide basement. enjoy time fine ""here"". 

First up, Covid-19 lung problem. That’s gets body. It’s really endothelial (blood vessel blood vessel lining) problem causing masses micro-clots. you’re prone getting clots, you’re likely worse outcome.

.....

Clotting seems major issue Covid-19 (leading strokes heart attacks). implications black population because

*- African-Caribbean ethnicity associated increased risk first recurrent venous thromboembolism 

*- African Americans 30–60% higher incidence VTE individuals European descent \*Venous thromboembolism (VTE), consisting deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE) there’s genetic factor play regarding increased risk clotting.

On top that, prevalence Vitamin deficiency insufficiency (which much worse BAME population white population - although low both) makes matters worse.

Vitamin anticoagulatory effect.  
Having propensity clotting low Vitamin perfect storm.

And, fatter are, Vitamin need fat stores Vitamin doesn’t make available 

Solution: Vitamin supplementation (for everyone particular at-risk groups!). people viruses tested strain. That's done research purposes, clinical purposes. 

Moreover, can't proven reinfection strain, can't prove remnants first infection. 

What adds MASSIVE undercount reinfections could getting common. little way know. interesting see modify estimated R0 around 2.5 recent report. really seems blowing 2.5 said 3 weeks ago. Remember atypical Kawasaki syndrome? It’s called MIS-C (Multisystem inflammatory syndrome children). Virtually cases BAME (black, Asian, mixed ethnicity) children, many obese. original Kawasaki syndrome there's strong correlation Vitamin deficiency. far nobody looked Vitamin levels children.

The version adults called MIS-A.  
In paper Oct 2 
 
all 1 BAME (but also look Vitamin D). yea couldnt afford keep everyonein quarantine, theyre finally closing schools fifth grade making masks mandatory outside starting tommorow Medical care blame. canceled Thanksgiving know won't. Christmas events either. There's also Black Friday whole weekend too. People shop even Walmart spreads deals like say. Look drastic increase cases 2 3 weeks Thanksgiving get repeat scenario 30 days later. Might well get rid cars well then, plenty people die those. ones? 🤣🤣 impact!

It's like, prepare burned alive. slow hurt. least isolate? This, much this. seem misunderstand word ""currently"".
 Deaths flatlined 100 basically. ?? giant family Thanksgiving 10% size, outside, featuring Turkey sandwiches. current discussion — may change. Warm soup discussed. 

Of course thousands families don’t make news..... really everything started getting dismantled. 

In addition teams teams countries thought might source pandemic.

We massive stockpiles gear rotted away.

We huge network trained government workers. 9/11 US started huge training program every level government ready deployed disaster response. organizations participated trained teams equipment. Fuck man, pissed country rn. Many people don’t care masks office large private parties gatherings everywhere. Hell, clubs still open 3100 cases per day 8 mio people. 

Pissed off. try careful possible, wear masks etc, idiots we‘ll probably another lockdown. I’m psychologically ready it, all. Arguments intellectual dishonesty ironically normally made people dishonest intellect. Bringing BLM shows intellectually bereft.

I comment deleted automod political complete waste time makes past bot? proven reinfections waning immunity, mutation virus. 

Coronaviruses self-policing mechanism keeps mutating much something like flu one mutated much. Sure - soon enough.

Food rotting fields, houses falling down. Significant wealth redistribution may required though. sure “heard” it’s pretty wild claim. I’d love read studies zodiac signs affect outcomes. provide link, perhaps would help understand friends/circle cane conclusion. 

Also, blood type role genetics play immune response far simple. suggest take basic biology class (there free ones online) give basic understanding concepts blood type variations. Shit got confusing you. Stop letting treat like complete naive imbecile. long reduce chance dying 80% good enough. epi team state convinced. one time write case reports right now. IDGAF. Go tell story Belgium-related thread then, maybe you’ll make friend. Facts like care 99.99% population dipshit knew soap destroys virus March. news? Right. soon tell them, hang me. finally asked keep hanging me, call back over?  would assume covid contractions higher midnight rather 10pm? sounds like BS im going assume BS unless see data along reasoning

Its arbitrary. covid spread easier 1am 10pm?

You dont answer none. stupid rule. Shut em let em open. Dictating hours makes sense. either safe not. think it’s jealousy personally. I’m sure many people north think moving it’s realistic so. see people enjoying beaches year round look reasons bad mouth Florida justify reason still stuck place born. people put charge make decisions capable making fail miserably keep putting charge fault?  It’s almost like taking away pandemic response team KIND THING doesn’t help Whitmer leader, every right shut however wants. Wah wah? Quarter million dead that's response? Yeah rarely visit here. Im Australia post coronavirus downunder

This sub gets annoying cuz well.. USA fking annoying. Nothing changes. Still trump freedum (selfish) trash gets posted every week. dont need negativity Trumped. like duped scarier first confirmed case, case. Muh freedom stop spreading myth.

It's myth, really dangerous.

Only idiots refuse accept truth Swedish government pursued ""herd immunity"" strategy resulted thousands unnecessary deaths, want emulate nobody trying eradicate it.

That's true... nations fewest numbers deaths fact try *stop* spread virus (eradicate) rather simply *slow* (mitigate).

It nations refused unable necessary eradicate virus helped continue circulating.

What truly dangerous lie ""eradicating"" virus possible. definitely is, nations would take it.

Sadly, happen. please try bullshit dangerous isn't.

Compared country, Sweden 2 times population, 237 times number deaths.

We went ""eradication"" route local transmission. Sweden went ""mitigation"" route new cases last three days total.

What ""dangerous"" denying Sweden made huge - fatal - mistake. thought US 3rd world country.......  person needs circumstantial evidence consensus suspicions I'm gonna put opinions sus bin. Way bin opinions take seriously. Waay opinions think qualified adopted policy. leadership shit 

You buy expensive equipment restaurant 

You bad ass server /manager , bartender working restaurant 

But owner start firing bad ass manager replace cousin, replacing server rich friend kids , replace chef friend gives $ run place 

That place turn shit Jesus hope least fired US best movies know vast majority robust immune response lasting several months.

""lasting several months"" functionally immunity. right tense here. back exponential growth people give less less fuck. winter going wild ride. guessing parents participate adult trials.. sure. also think it’s idea “3 less hours bar means 3 less hours uninhibited transmission” 

Or however many hours last call. live Puritan Boston bars kick 1 anyway Step one: Legally change name ""Justice An. Law""
Step two: Run lower court without multiple people running
Step three: Run campaign opponent liking Law Justice utter BS- US NEVER prepared. 

In America 1 5 people can't go doctor insurance majority rest terrified going doctor either sick time can't afford co-pay. situation guaranteeing outbreak vast swaths population seek medical care last option infecting others. 

To put perspective imagine public facing minimum wage employee start feel ill. typical low-income insurance plan. pay first $5,000 insurance even kicks in. 

Do really think someone making $10/hr $100 savings going making appointment doctors office pay $300 (which many cases due even see doctor) skip day work? gets even better person knows COVID think going stay home become homeless show work sick become homeless? right, that's like ""eventually"" thing. tiered list people supposed getting it. High-risk, seniors medical workers first Uh, know changes risk factors include overweight, half America, right?

Also, without like 20%, 5%. Plus reckless irresponsible statement take account potential longterm health issues happen previously healthy people protect conditions render unable take vaccines. US big us agree anything let alone enforce strategy follow. place huge, many different regions lifestyles immunity last long enough even work temporarily. Election day coming!  thing kids.. 

&amp;#x200B;

they tons relatively fresh vaccinations floating around inside them.

if follow recommended vax sched, getting jabbed first 15 doctor visits.

&amp;#x200B;

that's lot possible ""interactions"" adults worry about. Nat 1 medicine check hand, seems completely eliminated body patient full immune responce.

I think missed point. saying similar viruses. stating know long term systemic affects body yet a. novel virus. number cases presenting long term affects due SARS-CoV-2 infection. Again, still enough time gather analyze data. points bigger point relying herd immunity sans effective vaccine bing incredibly short sighted reckless. Plenty masks dollar tree, medical device though Oh hi. set remind bot too? next fall think bro. already ordered moderna vaccine oxfords vaccine Electing failed businessman banko least 5 times, reality show star leader country idea run anything successfully it. decimated pandemic response team botched covid response Mike Pence charge. pretty much sums up.  US crazy Uncle never stood chance virus. 

 (If sound angry am, best friend growing passed away ICU covid forgive forget botch partisan virus response) remember Tegnell fairly admit beginning scientific evidence masks helped all. decent evidence.

There evidence masks made difference used general population. lot evidence masks work hospital settings test bench understand still nothing really changed knowledge mask use general population. doesn’t mean effect, don’t really know. 

Tegnell bound laws, specifically [communicable diseases act 2004 chapter 1, section 4 control measures must based science proven experience must go beyond justifiable regard danger human health.
 measures must taken respect equal value human beings integrity measures concern children, special consideration shall given interests child individual opposes may taken possibilities available.

If science changes, Tegnell *must* change well. It’s crazy amount state plates Florida since we’ve reopened. Mostly NY, NJ, MA, people vacationing pandemic? Yep that’s talking about. yeah, vaccinate vulnerable, death rate gets cut half least expect people socially distance sacrifice jobs save lives yet can’t even muster empathy care rural Americans, nice logic 2.2 million projection NOTHING. 

“It’s contagious, less deadly, impact planet much longer.” 

I think that’s spot on. pandemic?! hoax!!!! U.S. people decided make political issue instead humanitarian issue. Duh! someone require evidence believe things, surely jumped conclusion scientists paid off. see evidence organizations paid Gabriela Gomes biomathematician modeling invididual variation population dynamics, sign evidence support claims, make claims quickly I'd question analysis.  Isn’t already illegal sell heroin? happened Rio Grande Valley Texas got point sent elderly Covid patients home die. suspect lot places facing reality soon. one thing happen one corner Texas. another happens multiple cities states once. setting strawman.

The issue whether vaccines good idea.

The issue whether particular vaccine available quickly proven effective. 

And I'm one buys magical thinking. Vaccines take time develop. 

This warp speed stuff straight con man's playbook overpromising underdelivering. good reasons vaccines can't developed whirlwind time issued emergency authorization. Wah wah. China responsible yet another global catastrophe. Suppression, sickness, disinformation abound! Absolutely cannot trusted. World problem! Fuck Chinas lies cause pandemic!  Wow, actually word word said tend conservative projections what’s going happen,” said. “I think we’ve got set reasonable expectations. I’m surprised pleasantly, it.""  assumes 100% vaccine efficacy unlikely sincerely hope ""plan"" told states beforehand, otherwise wasted lot time trying figure plans. also state plan giving supplies pharmacies, potentially causing conflict state distribution allotments.

The feds can't tell states make plans start making independent deals plans submitted. looks sloppy likely cause headaches help. summarize entire article one word : trump 

no need thank I’ve following IHME since March, I’ve seen haven’t right once. quotation first appeared like 30 years supposedly made lol. issue, always, complex taught it. Court indeed make decision went largely unenforced, never prescribed enacted. Namely, Jackson never asked help make decision reality, so, default never ignored it. Worcester v. Georgia really concerned state two particular native Americans prison. Georgia ignored Court releasing, ah, states rights still figured back then. justified acting Worcester basis federal government overstepping authority. 1832 acceptable argument. Civil war, ah, nullified line thinking, course. 

Ultimately, federal action stand out, trail tears happened 3 years later, never challenged court, obvious reasons. go spirit Worcester? Probably. federal official outright ignored Supreme Court, state official ignored state Supreme Court? No. law clear, even you’re happy results. It’s judges set law. legislature get something done responsible comes next. Putain. put bunch professional failures charge. else happening third week November? stumped. Cuz mu freedums Donald Trump turning political lever. know someone who’s mom got COVID, “got it”, died Pneumonia two weeks later. says didn’t die COVID. He’s telling everyone take masks get with.  people would rather “right” admit allowed parents die. link opinion piece *investment firm*, absolutely vested interest getting US “back work,” matter human cost.  need ""hard data"" else whatever fuck feel like? sounds like cop whatever want time, bet data presented never quite hard enough That’s works. even vaccine (a big “if”...how’s HIV vaccine looking?), way would get mass distribution Feb/March. 

Best case scenario June/July ...and that’s best case.

It’s like making widgets Playstations, demand global... plus makes sure it’s 1-dose you’re good? Lots take 3 shots 6 months (e.g.: TwinRX).

No actual viable expert claimed anything distributed across population Summer 2021 earliest. 

Not downer, “just months y’all” kinda sums America’s view all. mean responsible friends stupid people I'm sure we'll another opportunity check theory next 50-100 years :/ shit people like Exactly.  people? vote interests? Complain know best everyone country? simultaneously calling scientists know eleitists? 

&amp;#x200B;

Yea, people. cannot care people anymore. vestigial limb humanity forever try ponder useful for. Trickle exist, look lost jobs hotels, movie theaters, stadiums, theme parks closed. Holy smokes bars open pandemic? Notice two biggest culprits somehow NYC, done good job following medical guidelines seen first hand unchecked virus population. Something definitely check clear astroturfing going on. reason happening today, maybe flop yesterday's debate ratings might driving desperate people out.  Gang Putin extent, WI incumbent judge barely win election retire soon former -walking piece processed cheese slice - Gov. Walker appointed someone who’d never judge even trial courts. know come back levels US states came back go back lockdown stop spread. That's point, didnt go back lockdown would likely spreading increasing rate. commenter claims contain virus gone, clearly happened NZ hard lockdownccountries CDC set standards countries looked guidance. Trump administration decided ignore advice. rethorical question? look exactly trump administration 2016 on... even took money pandemic prevention intitutions build wall something.

it's 100% GOP. Republicans ruin everything touch. maybe mention percentage long-term symptoms dwindled time Untested? Lmao. Boy oh boy. Get grip. one cares get vaccine least understand you’re talking making dumb comment like “untested” daily numbers report France hospitals. Care homes use different report system added lumps total. Wondering sub isn’t talking EU passing US daily cases? Wear damn mask There’s misinformation point. Either you’re smart you’ll fine you’re stupid/selfish won’t fine. Another political stunt. Vaccine (When available) given every one wants it. matter drugstore affiliation. dare alarmist Greedy, lazy, corrupt.  yes, dumb. know late, DA say ignorance, legislature passes laws? Trump, McConnell, Pence. easy question. citizens smart follow common sense Good news phase 2 data released pretty promising immune response rates. I'm pretty confident, response long enough lived (6 months hopefully) vaccines effective ending pandemic entirely. What's important note Poland gathers ""COVID"" ""with COVID"" deaths. data tells 300 people died Covid since start pandemic, rest covid died co-existing diseases.

Which tells Covid survivability rate 99,97%

The lockdowns crime never get punished. Hope manufacturer absolutely cranking hell doses. Hoping tens millions doses year end. DT guy made plan wrong skin colour. anonymity Internet allows free expression hidden subversion. 

I often wonder freedom speech actually mean freedom anonymous speech? one hand, allows people express without fear reprisal. hand, allows imposters come stir populace. Questions like make think freedom liberty 21st century. yes, certain group people still complain restaurants pubs close monday. group downplays danger covid supporters party best polls 2024. 
their leader trust covid app governement says trust governement.  Science denial tribalism. simple that. surprised lmao

My friend lives Wisconsin told almost everyone living believe virus even exists Poorly written, biased, ranking system clear. 

D+. argentina lockdown since march lifted recently, no? resurgence like europe so, desperate get senior votes back. sad. Yeah idunno man wrote like 5am toilet 😂  month would enough make stick. managed bring Italy back catastrophy spring.

The good news FINALLY something. Agreed subtracting deaths would performed average level compared countries. Easiest question ever!  That's pretty big idealogical statement. I'm backed science. science means change minds face new evidence. militant ignorant. That's catchy. Half measures enforceable. invite 10 different friends every day party you, going even notice? Better rules though. Trump. Per capita California would insane 46,000+ cases 933 fatalities. Florida would 25,000+ cases 507 fatalities. article converted video kind make accessible folks want read whole thing. public right know government elect fails perform duty why. win!! Haha 😆 would attribute death posthumously patient died seeing doctor wasn’t tested? Death certificates usually don’t list Covid cause someone’s family said seemed like Covid autopsies rare. 

And someone lived alone, even less likely. someone died stroke, embolism heart attack triggered covid (and ton evidence effect Covid vascular system), way confirm autopsy post-mortem testing, rarely happens. 

Here’s one example happen. 

“Officially, cause death chronic lung disease. going that. sudden illness left fatigued leave house, contact multiple people later tested positive COVID-19. Yet Bob’s death certificate doesn’t list disease cause even probable cause death. never got tested — didn’t want enter hospital separated Fran, wife 48 years.

Instead, didn’t die hospital beginning pandemic, guidelines rapidly changing testing hard come by, Bob Duffy became one people fell statistical cracks. writing,1 22,843 New Yorkers officially died COVID-19. Bob Duffy counted among them.” Lookin' Vitamin doubles every weak. (maybe see reduction today). Test results wil lget delayed cause reach peak testing capacity. remember correct eldery homes can't test anymore saturday give tests again. No, cause debate, legitimate statements. Individual responsibility work problem. Collective action required, even flies face political philosophy half society.

It's dangerous ideas censored mislead people. Wow made official thing? gave idea? I've seen, elderly people consider *themselves* elderly. think means people older them. 

They also think count ""old"", ""grandparents"", even grandkids. count ""sick"" either-- relative still insisting high blood pressure controlled medication.

So think everyone offended plan offended, think group we're killing include them. Yeah saw that. see Costco too. Smh DARE state truth logic reasoning.


Here comes conservative straw man argument “WELL BIDEN DEMS 😡😡” US would expect. lmao even come sub, y'all apocalyptic here. comments control. Guess so, curious see would 3 months. Given whole issue virus politically weaponized left, might reasonable.

""COVID God's gift left"" Jane Fonda Noncompliant people. sense entitlement country insane.


And Trump spun narrative ignorance pander entitled people many Governors mimicked refused shut down.


It's like entitlement became deadly contagious. thinking picture packed public transport Switzerland don’t put blame people NY, NJ, vacationing Florida pandemic? president still questions effectiveness validity masks so... Even better! Apparently can’t alphabet  Exactly, even close bad even half country takes vaccine. half American people think earth flat, vaccines cause autism, COVID hoax created deep state One thing strict lockdown measures Asian countries. Try United States. see happens half assed efforts tried. no, United States prepared Huh. Never heard that... I'm going look it, thanks! Paywall that, almost certainly good vaccine couple months. Never used prescribed tetracyclines treatment viral infections. yet encounter published clinical practice guidelines issued Infectious Disease societies US UK sort recommendations use tetracyclines Ivermectin anti-viral agents. shown in-vitro activity mean would adequate in-vivo activity well point, antiviral properties agents deemed potential clinical benefit must rigorously confirmed via clinical trials. time, agents routinely used anti-viral treatment clinical practice. Nobody trust government whether contact person entirety epidemic even feasible.

I bit hyperbolic fun, c'mon. stretching limits obtuseness. Nobody note advocated contact person entirety epidemic. measures taken month ago, case numbers decrease, slowly open again. want costly bars/restaurants go bankrupt. true, agree, anyways. What's point then? may late, case numbers high measures may enough all.

Instead shorter, milder local lockdowns much earlier, risk complete lockdown collapse health system now. Good job. fail? It’s legal America endanger whole society basis childish understanding constitution. “I can’t wear mask cuz muh cOnStiTuTiONaL rIgHtS” Inbred white people South crying communism oppression fly Confederate flag think Black Lives Matter terrorist organization. Conservative fanaticism brainwashing death country infectees facility made critical lifesaving stuff shuting posability people need stuff die.

Pay hope back stock. block American citizens returning US via flights cases emergencies. Americans constitutionally entitled flights back home. International law make mandate either. exercised 9/11. lying giving false information.  get full scholarship too. $25,000 even semester's worth. well, Germany's Covid death rate (percentage sick people resulting death) slightly bigger U.S' (2.769% vs 2.706%). medical care (more hospital beds, ICUs doctors) would've factor insist is, clearly shown terms better recovery outcomes Germany case. Absolutely point life said either perpetual lockdown lockdown ever. actually open mind like real intellectual, opinion may gone overboard lockdowns restrictions, causing massive economic decline. may severely underperforming expectations lockdown do. think do, using Barrington Declaration evidence, reduce lockdown measures, time continue masks social distancing. farfetched idea. see kept talking like though, given assumed there's dichotomy. assume try think reasonable, like cult. totally agree, preliminary. wanted give comparison. know many countries heavily underreporting Covid-19. nobody look operation Dark Winter? Sure, years ago, proved US HORRIBLY unprepared pandemic. Whitmer starts beating PR drums hard loudly possible, every single day. Every single hour. Every single time someone tested positive, every single time someone admitted hospital, every single time someone dies.

Not her, entire Democratic establishment, “liberal media” need hang every single person affected around necks GOP, state national level. Exactly, pandemics need collective action consideration common good. Like biggest benefit wearing mask.is less likely infect others. We’ll temps freezing within next days southern WI, they’ve already frost across much MI. case man Nevada appears 2 different strains genetic analysis testing. I've seen literature suggest second reinfection might likely asymptomatic assuming produce antibodies again. 

But yeah headline lady awful, much context nobody bother learn. sorry innocent people infected. plan. Gut authority, people get sick, don’t vote, die, drag social programs.  Donald said took 20 years aging away.... /s blame Governor everything Covid related he's vile antagonistic piece shit even pretended make decisions based public health. Impossible! [We cross-immunity previous infections! Covid heard?!?  Strange. wonder got downvoted suggesting NATO accept foreign aid developing country.

Am missing something here? nation may prepared, people, may worst ready. counties, particular Asian ones, empathy whole feel Americans lack. Americans much individual thinkers think terms effect v effect others. saw behavior time time stories parties, gatherings, lakes beaches kept open, bars restaurants. Sweden didn’t lock people suppose without question. Americans sorely lack ability. Th also point don’t blame Trump. Even done everything experts wanted, locked country February would still close now. It’s going take vaccine even may enough. Republicans Trump 
Racism ignorance. 
The traditional ""4 horsemen"" action depends definition personal responsibility. think Germans consider “personally responsible” making sure government society function well. Americans tend consider government society outside forces try avoid evade, favor thing. 

Broad generalizations, course.  would argue argument depends personally define ""prepared"".

[The US pandemic meant used something like Coronavirus occurred. Actually, CDC [*multiple playbooks Obama Administration left playbook Trump Administration use case needed. was, Trump Administration *decided use it*.

Being prepared event *executing preparations* two different things. Dumb fucks made plan. I.E Trump.

If president start telling us seriousness danger highly contagious virus, clearly dangerous flu, think America would listening right now.

&amp;#x200B;

Instead president EXACTLY opposite gave idiot people validation he's FUCKING PRESIDENT UNITED STATES. freedom free. get deal side effects stupidity. Obama. “If Ivanka told throw 218k people bridge, would you?”  Depends gym membership, guess. region run 1000/year barbells last longer that. nation whole

is took words You’re hero. Thanks Classic american pride, can't admit top tier  expensive gym membership

bahahahahaha Short answer: We're dumb. 

Longer answer: people charge heads inconceivably far asses broke neck sitting back shoulders try shove back asses. It’s even worse sneezes coughs mask hanging face course. clear back April understand contradicts point all. girl article memory issues. That's exactly what's occurring even mild cases significant percentage respondents. large percentage COVID-19 cases go unconfirmed. would expect cohort study, regardless, 24% excludes them, really see point raising it. He's comparing germany's response preparedness report... Comparing apples oranges. whole article outcome usa bad prepared... Devaluing report result align asinine. know usa failed report wrong, American leadership. Briefings Tuesday Thursdays, number updates Tuesday Friday. Today last update week.

* People COVID-19 ICU currently 30, unchanged since yesterday. 
* numbers tests performed last week published [this ; way numbers presented changed last week since week 40 number tests performed unique people tested week available compared. Previously week 26 including, statistics showing unique people tested 27-39 numbers tests performed. new statistic shows both, previous reports available table week 26 bottom page link weeks 22-39. 
* 8 new reported deaths spread 6/10 14/10 - one extra 7/10, 8/10, 13/10, 14/10, two extra 6/10 10/10. deaths reported following regions: one Blekinge, Dalarna, Kronoberg, Värmland och Västra Götaland, three Stockholm. age distribution two 70-79 group, five 80-89 one 90+. 

**Please, remember lag reporting deaths reported certain day usually mostly deaths happened previous days. average takes 11 days report 90% deaths certain day (see links graphs looks)**

Useful links:

American living Paris, find weird French restaurant owners saying impossible open 6 get additional dinner service curfew starts. agree, difficult get tested march positive tests came hospitals. think numbers would mind boggling march. 
Its say wont get though... Fingers crossed dont. Nothing save us virus like locking massive group people poorly-ventilated holding cell. Ok 10k cases reported today. 
I waiting test result since wednesday. Doctor says testing labs swamped...
Also 49 dead reported... Normalcy return populations individual countries vaccinated, said individual countries. 

The second third coming generations vaccines improve first generations started push last worries away. 

Yes, Normalcy still take while, we're still bit licensure distribution young healthy people, come, go back non-masked non-distanced life. get people there, time bite sour apple mask distance finite time might sound long really not. Make mistake, hate too, helps time being. course, there's vaccine approved use yet one think meant? past longest day year mean getting cooler immediately. August referred dog days summer US hot can’t move? According Centers Disease Control Prevention, average American man 40-inch waist weighs 198 pounds. average woman 39-inch waist weighs little 170 pounds. So, unless you’re sitting next child, there’s pretty good chance encroachment. could possibly meant ""do want stay inside forever""? White House keep hands single thing? Medicine really bad track record dealing postviral conditions. Downplaying sorts illness psychosomatic predates even germ theory. based false premise already know every physical cause illness is. happened peptic ulcers, MS, HIV, list stretches forever. harder ignore long, clearly symptoms can't easily played depression. one really cares conditions long they're outrightvlethal and/or infectious, quality life disease burden damned. [archive link anyone trouble accessing article *”Pfizer’s Chief Executive Officer Albert Bourla noted letter posted website filing depended several factors, including data effectiveness may may available late October.”*

Basically, moving forward depends data available positive + lot businesses promise sanitize surfaces encourage distancing indoors, like restaurants. Surface transmission considered main mode transmission. takes air conditioner blowing air one infected person everyone else. 

Indoor dining crazy risky takeout contactless delivery allowed (though take account restaurants need revenue dining in, getting financial support). think pretty serious. already fired suspended top health hospital guys. Compare anywhere else world keep failing still job.

China large, things like bound slip cracks. deal move on. Hopefully results positive Guess failed like missions get moon. Yeah, yearly flu deaths tiny fraction Covid killed past seven months. 

You can't catch car crash elevator someone car crash hours ago also used elevator. 

You understand word contagious means, ""accident"", concepts half assedly brought here.

Youre embarrassment arrogant blowhards. US, yes. Probably Chinese vaccines get EUA. Astra Zeneca far behind outside US. avoid misrepresenting study, clearly indicate comment study non-peer reviewed preprint.

More directly problematic: sample confirmed covid patients representative population (sample much higher hospitalization rate total covid-infected population). covid sample representative covid cases, “sicker” cases bunch. 

On top that, everything u/danny841 said. Right? Hell obama attacking people instead helping them. want president least seems care instead one afraid he's he's getting shit ton lawsuits. go path virus....it like this. chose path hope day reckoning coming soon... Anyone buying going whole world hurt month interest rates increase people qualify loans.. don’t think forcing masks enough something nonessential like gyms. It’s simple people pull masks wear incorrectly. see fucking time. Unless you’re going somebody floor enforcing zero tolerance mask policy, don’t think trust everybody come behave good faith. 

If they’re going remain open all, think you’ve got loop testing, probably tighter controls capacity. even read article?

You compared germany's response concept pandemic preparedness, that's apple's oranges.

As described article eluded title, preparedness measured according nation's The pandemic playbook, passed President Barack Obama President Donald Trump, had one nation's key planning documents: a 69-page blueprint laying decisions made agencies mobilized health disaster. Throughout pages, document stressed need early public health response coordinated federal index measured anything inappropriately, none acted happened didn’t said we’d do. That’s everything fell apart. We ended best prepared one worst outcomes.

I say flawed take, take consideration ignorance arrogance American leadership purpose report. work. already well established back Trump administration purchased Remdesivir. That's there's protest international community US buyout. using herd immunity strategy advocated U.S. Youre ignorant. illinois well healthcare people scared coming much worse saw months ago good hate family countries clear divide power comes situation. Scheduled lockdowns planned months advance perfect compromise. Gives everybody time prepare, people less caught guard, less people end breaking rules. isn’t true. 

A confirmed reinfection genetic sequencing first infection second infection, confirm genetically two slightly different versions sars-cov2 virus. 

You couldn’t see hundreds day vast vast majority people haven’t requisite genetic testing done. Interest rates low go moment creep shortly. people run unemployment money, people lose jobs, businesses shut, eviction moratoriums end, prices tank. Tons people's credit shot many burning savings. time goes on, fewer people able qualify homes. Get ready crash!!! already know this?  thought beginning stated reduced recovery times patients already going recover selling point free'd hospital resources quicker. Flu shots exist still deaths, sacrifice people people cannot stay home.
Crashes contagious - car crash kill someone walking sidewalk. can't people MUST leave house cannot walk destination instead using cars? available wish yet? remember login details check nightmare. I'm Illinois happening fast. well. things close exponential going another surge. neighbors flying somewhere vacation today. I'm certain quarantine three kids get back, right? think I'm sure they're going right in-person school. [archive link anyone trouble accessing article American not, humans rarely blame themselves. 

Before social media conspiracies, never huge following short amount time. even follow conspiracies, aggressive people agree them. Anecdotal mask adherence mall aichi pretty much 100% even crowded. I'm guessing plays part reducing viral load severity infections etc Wow really went head. Fucking yes! Forcing harsh lockdown measures without proper financial support reckless heartless Tory bullshit. magic money tree supporting workers always magic money tree bailing rich, buying DUP. still extremely high numbers country size.

Belgium 375 inhabitant per km² 

France 123 inhabitant per km² 

US 34 inhabitant per km² clearly factor speed pandemic spread. mean Belgian gov fucked Looks like using open cv this, relatively simple app write. seems like good idea unfortunately many people even temperature infected, sometimes first day infection. US using Duck Duck Go. 
This first hit.  

The entire rest results similar. 
I’m saying either right wrong, far evidence backing saying. 
Do specific link share paints different picture? 855 new cases last friday first day quite time fewer cases week ago.
Last Friday reported 5892 deaths 26 new deaths week. Viruses also lipid envelopes dissolved soap. Exactly many countries like US India got coronavirus Europe kept vigilant people coming China Europeans even outbreak Italy widely reported. I'm jealous, family treating like nothing going on. surprised told I'm holidays year. Singapore example enlightened dictatorship, perhaps China disregard concentration camps (which Chinese perfectly fine with, Westerners like Muslims anyway).

They akin forced education camp, learn Mandarin, watch government propaganda receive vocational training (to prevent unemployed turning religion comfort). 
It still good thing (unlawful detention), really ""ethnic cleansing"". Telling people give hobbies things mental (and physical) health indefinite period time viable strategy. Trippy similar Ontario Alberta, half world away.  certainly possible

But cautioned assume last like decades anything, we've never developed kind immunity coronavirus? kind like everything right now. Enough people refrain activities we're sort getting by. Maybe enough people skip family gathering we'll limp major surge. So, Boomers. Yea. That’s exactly it. Yup easy break shit, much harder put things together. idiots thought 40 years trade negotiations could redone matter months everything would smell fucking roses. That's works UK hermit pariah state next year, muh sovereignty right? even imagine insanity tweets even 10,000 died Obama’s watch? Trump would never stopped talking many died 911.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* comes much obvious reasons extremely well-fitted answer question.

The predisent ""suffering"" dementia. displays many, many characteristics family history it. need wait autopsy call it. He's got it, black-and-white disease lucid moment completely symptomatic moment speech people would want make points for/against. he's got it, let's take given relevant next part:

The predisent refers pattern antisocial behaviors attitudes, including manipulation, deceit, [aggression](http://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/anger), lack [empathy](http://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/empathy) others. Sociopathy non-diagnostic term, synonymous ""[psychopathy](http://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/psychopathy),"" though overlap leads frequent confusion. Sociopaths may may break law, exploiting manipulating others, violate trust human enterprise runs on.

The predisent (it preferred spelling), okay, *is. a. sociopath.* answer question article poses. clear obvious anyone able look facts modicum objectivity. made snap decision virus, based persecution complex part dementia, forced entire apparatus party quadruple-down it, ""infecting"" tweet-minded followers utter nonsense start. reason never turned around dementia, absolutely incapable understanding anyone else might feel it. possible so. Even caught went pedestrian aspects medical care like vitals measured every often - still beause always *only* far he's concerned.

That ""we"" spiraled prior-to-2016-inconceivable failure. country unable address deadly virus outbreak demented sociopath white house. simple. don’t understand mentality... saying ‘well I’ve never seen it, must real’...

There literally millions people who’ve seen it.. literally wiped half people’s families .. spreading people thought yourself. 

This doesn’t concern all? say knew thought air make sick. something start covid19 many scientist denied, new information came aerosol effect. person keeps going every thread saying ""bullshit"". I've seen 3 different threads last 4 read. makes even harder controll spread due high population densitiy. Montana 83 million people? Get double sided tape store. know 3M brand sticks like motherfucker, nose tends little oily. put bridge nose tap mask onto it. Voila! Social media amplifier problem, problem/cause idiocy catastrophic level amongst Americans look places, institutions people blame failures inadequacies. terrified Swiss allowed gathering 1000 people starting October 1st. obviously stupid thing do, considering trends, it.

I'm sure (or least, been) clear people happen.

In case, also weird government currently appealing people ""get sh\*t together"". weird say something line, weird think people - like people \*trying\* get covid, simply incompetent acting responsibly. Given face shield open along sides, even garbage protecting eyes. Goggles worn instead. perfect, better Maybe pay virus go away? US pay Soooooo much money healthcare maybe insurance companies give money research? Well probably give bonus CEO’s.....never mind. sad certainly lol, im talking medication like pills, im talking also virus body, long take get worst better, information 6-8 months ago tired. headline see every couple months different spot country. We'll never learn.

Please, scientists, save us ourselves. Flu shots exist car crashes contagiously spread around pompous arrogant assholes spewing bullshit faceholes. Given face shield open along sides, even garbage protecting eyes. Goggles worn instead. perfect, better. It’s likely closer 3-4 million given death rate countries consistent thorough testing. I'm sorry. feel like workplaces really worst.

My spouse works office need all. ""wanted everybody back normal."" choice lost job pandemic dependent job. really frustrating top management asshole make choices affect family's health care. 

They really care us. weren’t best prepared treat uncontrolled pandemic. best prepared control pandemic. government decided didn’t care to. Truth. read “impotence top.” Also truth. mean, it’s gonna bad, human history really bad winters. Mini ice age + Black Death some, example. mean living history, I’m probably okay. Given face shield open along sides, even garbage protecting eyes. Goggles worn instead. perfect, better possible common, think it’s hard get point. common we’d see hundreds day US only. answer questions. valid ones. Hi! man top think mean “Idiocracy”. sir, win best comment month. goal preserve life freedoms, history overwhelmingly shows us socialism way go!! obvious social aspects school, lengthy list out. 
I surprised outright ban needed though. 
Did Germany issues people home schooling like another poster shared case France, others? Oklahoma Governor Stitt refuses state mask mandate even OKC ICU beds full patients flown states treatment. know outcomes critical patients waiting additional hours treatment good. Donald Trump Republican enablers thought freedom American thing only? Skip paywall:   Found one ? Person agreeing ? pretty optimistic mass availability rapid testing, White House situation happened. opinion rapid tests alone enough, unless become lot reliable right now, would still need used combination masks distancing, replacement them. said anyone problem? You’re projecting dude. I’ve talking math: retire portfolio bonds dividend stocks, decreasing rates shouldn’t affect retirement rates drop, value holdings (at high rates) go proportionately. Good point, need encourage positive behavior Add top piss poor interest rates fact inflation just.. is. There's literally point saving. Yikes. February type numbers. Guilting someone doesn’t want go pandemic someone lose job ridiculous. 

Says guy lobbing ""gullible"" lockdowns killing businesses, it’s people making choices. 

Oh, definitely. fact people can't eat indoors thing NYC restaurants. 50% close good never reopen again. That's like peanuts. Please.

There ""lockdowns"" via regulations. Limiting areas 15% capacity locking it. Gyms, theaters, entertainment venues mostly closed. Limiting travel outside home ""only essentials"" locking down. yodel ""mountain tops""... Yup. Vaccination gives herd immunity without whole ""huge masses people getting sick it"" thing. second? US 8th wave! USA USA USA! right states first wave 

here WI swamped. literally first wave. first wave hits, deaths go WAY every needs stop living fear especially wont vaccine available young healthy people right away proves virus deadly thought lol going come orange Ignoramus?  grandfather born 1921, died 2009.

You get groceries delivered someone pick you. grandparents live upper peninsula Michigan (very rural) able get groceries delivered there's reason can't. 
You quit job scary you. one forcing go. 

 That's freedom choice. Wow, surprise. /S United absolutely reason 100% honest assessment. let's even get started absolutely reputable organization US Department Defense. also said October one point possibility. Actually takes voting instead sitting becoming politically active instead expecting change time. mean, quoted sentence he's advocating reopening everything country. thinks masks make immune virus. He's close point, still missed it.

Advocating reopen everything back full capacity long people wear masks going solve problem. Masks mitigate lot risk, it. virus still going spread still going kill tens, hundreds thousands people even suddenly everyone woke wore masks, especially we're encouraging people go back normal pre-pandemic habits. Cause people self-absorbed. benefited immigration first want share benefits anyone else. doubt ""vaccine"" released end year. Book it. Whether vaccine effective, safe, entirely different question. ***something*** released. Fuck you. 0.0000000001% Yet another proof country one stupidest one world, could even say stupidest one ever. ""we'll right back double jeopardy"" heck suppose eat mask on. absolute terms, worst. US 5000 deaths per week 220,000 total deaths. far worse Brazil #2 150,000 total deaths.

No developed nation even close US absolute death total. friend friend posted kid died COVID19 ""So what? guess meant be.""

You better believe screenshot comment save future use, hoping use reason. here. want go Dynamite badly. hunter-gatherer brains. 

Legit, things like violence, theft, racism, misogyny, homophobia, wacko religions, binge eating, ADHD, alcoholism, gluten intolerance exist. Alright dude, trying explain point. Sorry that. grocery store worker require education training can't get job. no. saw guy barbell many 45s house. Crazy stuff. Yeah like Democrats went people caused 2008 financial crisis stopped wars. Also 421 deaths.

[Positivity rate: ***61.8%*** 27.662 People really see curves continent see absurdly fast Europe's cases surged: [Daily reported COVID-19 cases, like first third curve Spanish flu:  much weight lose? live lockdown seemed desired effect. even eased cases started going haywire. schools opened back up, colleges particularly. 

The holidays lovely year college kids come home. soon college students returning families major winter holidays. December/January seasonal intensification could send things control.

The US two peaks trough between, seems general mood learned control enough keep levels. Strange say given 500-1000 daily deaths, nation whole seems gotten complacent. Hopefully return bite us. actually tried? could order right wanted to. know statistically Trump going fine reason anyone statistically would still believe gave something worked. Nice anecdote went Mexico days almost every store went step piece wet rug, take temperature check, sprayed shit god knows was, use hand sanitizer provided. course mask, also one person per party. proof things work? seeing things US? Can't trust Mexico covid numbers seem low time testing high capacity. Came say that. really vile. It’s like GOP state wants herd immunity path irony becoming undesirable citizens, bet wall serve Mexico Yodeling sb outlawed #1 deaths per week (absolute death rate) total deaths. even wrong compare using absolute death rate instead per capita. Houston already mobile morgues first wave. FEMA sent them. hell Cleveland been? family Lakewood everyone wearing masks everyplace in. Ah yes, gym equipment hasn’t global shortage since pandemic began  wish people realized enormous first wave ACTUALLY was. look second wave bigger even close. March April literally impossible get test, people dying without tests. Looking test adjustments graphs truly amazing. simple step adjust March/April data 8x. follow anything, already knew consulted medical team one. find badass although like much. feel like winter going brutal, I’m going need indoor hobby, video games tired winning. Please give doctors office heads positive appointment, though. personally disagree, there’s studies showing slightly higher IFR suggest, I’ll admit. Still isn’t 4% number see around here....the CFR isn’t even 4% Precisely. time, China test 9 million 12 found Advice teens current undergrads: go university (if already planning coronavirus). already university, stay university. 100% online sucks, worth stay program. feel like missed 2 years social life, parties, student organizations/societies, always get back grad school. refer Account/Tweet: anybody reading guy basically pro-virus refuses believe reinfection rare hold breath, place food said mouth, place mask back mouth chew like normal.

It currently mainly produced research institute production limited. Majority doses goes Phase 3 trial Moscow medical workers across getting efficacy status vaccine many days?

Vaccination generates protective antibodies starting ~2 weeks vaccination point (usually 3 weeks). Vaccine developer states 2-shot vaccination 3 weeks shots 6 weeks total required properly protect vaccinated person.

So, absolutely minimal lag accept data would preliminary - 3 weeks antibodies, 2 weeks start trial vaccination minimal statistically significant group people (it started pretty slow, ~50-100 people per day, accelerated later), 2 weeks estimate actual protection (again, sure get anything statistically significant short time) - 7 September + 7 weeks = start November.

Realistically, first statistically significant data would probably come whole world see trend global vaccine approved?

Some vaccine developers mass produce vaccines still Phase 3 trials stockpile them, lag would mostly eliminated. raises another ethical question - keep doses warehouse instead offering vulnerable people, even undertested vaccine would much safer what, example, ""red zone"" medical personnel encounters work?

Western countries chose use vaccines reach usual quality. would kill people, may vaccinated instead still-unproven vaccines.

Russia chose put vaccine field soon proven worse virus itself. would save people virus, may harm kill people traditionally accepted ""safe"" vaccines. Yes, specifically states consulted medical teams. idea health like (I don’t follow closely anything — saying it’s “unknown”, simply still think she’s pretty bad ass, spite this) Thank didn’t see that!

In terms science, leniency bullshit like “ second”. chemistry class small particle contaiminant fuck entire experiment. Apparently didn’t wash beaker enough. That’s chemical soo sensitive eyeball triple wash looks completely clean reality not.

For mask wearing, soon pull mask reason hell even readjusting increase risk takes one small window opportunity put risk ( key word risk) Also, number people rejecting vaccine go either get sick decide safe enough 20-50 million others it, etc. ""Los Angeles County recently reported first newborn cases U.S., 8 193 babies testing positive COVID-19.""

I’m proud Christie this. wish Trump mature enough admit wrong. Ontario you? Maybe changed graduated teacher's college almost teaching jobs vs new teachers. Coronavirus affects small % people. Bolsonaro even get hospitalised. Fuck you, Chris Christy.

Stop enabling childlike tendencies Donald Trump. like 2025. That's we're doing. bf take covid seriously getting tested Thanksgiving. family takes seriously (all pro-mask) expose high risk activities. least want spend time family holiday seen long time miss them. Teacher here, agree. think we’ll back rolling somewhat normal say fall 2021. district 4 days week never see return 5 heard nothing days. Glad survived. I’ll curious long-term recovery. Lockdowns suck last long. ebola pandemic way gonna spend 5 months hard lockdown anymore  laughed hard There's correlation unsafe government being, careful silent majority reasonable people response. I'd bet ton Floridians see they're ones bars spending ton time home. correct. person trying convince people every 25 people get one die far truth. basically position like tone listen say. 

You positioning false equivalence. care agree facts not. Republican party past 40 years past 3 years especially eroded principles American society. 

They stood way progress entire time, worse actively interfered progress society majority Americans repeatedly stood said want time.

In recent history, Republicans blocked Obama considerable part presidency. principal pass Democrat forwarded laws especially nothing Obama proposed. lost Congress Obama reelected president. people spoke it. took complete loss power stop interfering American people.

Even now, Trump presidency first half houses congress, Senate Republicans refuse see single bill House Democrat holds House majority. 

There even need argument Senate refusing even discuss several hundred bills time pandemic economic collapse dereliction duty least. primary reason exist argue bills House.

So feel free disagree premise, every single era economic social success past 80 years Democratic presidency. Republicans seemed bring poor response natural tragedy, corruption, malfeasance, criminal investigations levels administration, economic ruin society. 

Another piece consider... Research disparity criminal convictions Repub v Dem administrations. US never even flattened curve. guys second (third?) huge wave next.. happens winter stays winter? Yea, we're fucked. Also government screwed big time making big deal elections people live denial. country screwed. time herd immunity ever attained vaccination. much less What’s over/under many GOP test positive realize wearing mask actually important? going admit fucking clue throw hands up? Use custom function, test scenario want. Completely agree point view . isn’t. Guess can't see boyfriend time soon... ever point.... Maybe test lot asymptomatic people. 

I think infected way want get tested get home-jailed 14 days daily testing remained pretty consistent lately, damn then, that's good.  Don’t worry, anything consider “bad news” really reaching. Including infections. wasn't. going normal high again. numbers Wisconsin today blow mind. Nearly 25% positive 3700 new cases, another record high level total hospitalizations. probably 0.2 0.4% latest studies published
And heterogenous population. rate much lower know potential victims protect better (elderly, comorbidities) going straight face talk ?

Still lot people might die 0.1% rate. country going war loosing soldiers, guns widely available, pretty hard make argument EvErY LiFe CoUnTs! pathetic fuck mouse appreciate neutrality elephant steps tail Lol wat.

I kidding. Like kids say girlfriend different place friends know. probably asked ""yes no"" question, got answer, challenged person gave you.

you also easily google question. clicking rush air, least experience. Sorry burst bubble, they're quieter would expect. real, ""not bang, whimper"" scenario. Yeah, level sympathy sacrificing couple good years life shut-in extend people's lives (timea probability 5%) greatly diminished mind Weird flex okay 3brown1blue youtube video simulating that. cool watch 1 data point consider, ifo institute factored available numbers tests contact tracing. scale former peak infections current testing capabilities, would meassured ~16000 cases back peak.

Over 94% people comorbidity, often one. There’s way tell gave person flu wouldn’t way too. 
To lock country 95+% survival rate ludicrous. 

Hell, I’m immunosuppressants I’m concerned one bit. Can’t hide forever. - tests show sympthoms, always adopted strategy 'save tests'.

&amp;#x200B;

its retarded, sympthoms still test positive, know folks still front lines working, others relegated poverty?

because literally happens every opportunity much lockdown evictions start... Real mvp Realistically, we’re going virus kills estimated 0.7% people infects, especially figure vastly skewed older sicker people. top that, treatments improving, reinfection appears relatively rare, although possible. 1 data point consider, ifo institute factored available numbers tests contact tracing. scale former peak infections current testing capabilities, would meassured ~16000 cases back peak. 
Hence, still time prevent reaching dynamic experienced spring. time already sparse. US best prepared shit Go ahead, keep denying severity situation reinfection cases pile up. Truth overrides rosey outlook actually real catastrophe. agree, fact people accustomed eating dinner 9-10pm unwilling change routines eat earlier. never lifted 50-person limit gatherings, unlike many countries. that, guess higher levels immunity, especially among children (Sweden never closed primary schools) dampening back-to-school effect. different phase curve catch rest Europe time, time tell. bad...technically link stated 660,000 die respiratory illness linked seasonal flu year. mean 2.5 million number link showing would include likes illnesses COPD shouldn’t included comparison all.  What's wrong this? UK seeing surge cases, need *something*. It’s nearly easy come Canada Europe come US. 

Also, seems like travel countries restricted well, unless I’m misunderstanding something. 

People don’t talk countries US closer there’s threat people crossing border there. Beijinger here.

There outbreak June here. officers got instant dismissal that.

Exactly. wish people aware important point. U.S. organization called PREDICT successfully isolated studied infectious disease every four months. trained scientists confront emerging pandemics. America literally protecting world pandemics.

Trump defunded PREDICT two months covid-19 spend crap-ton money keeping people alive late life many countries socialized medicine experience because

1. people healthier live longer anyways 
2. people get seriously sick, spend $4,000,000 keeping alive another 6 months high-pain, near veg state super common US. 

We lot people vulnerable something like COVID. 48 years old T2 Diabetes, taking 5-6 pill cocktails every day control myriad conditions. There's 13M children obesity America accounts going remain obese kids, raise obese kids. we’re experiencing rise cases like everyone else. we’re entering season respiratory illness creates best conditions virus spread easily warmer months, we’re definitely spared that. real news: published Stanford study (John P Ioannidis ) finds infection fatality -sigh-

honestly... * Schools open many take proper measures avoid spread.

* people allowed work home sit desk spreading virus.

* People allowed go bars restaurants little restrictions. getting colder inside month.

* Shops supermarkets open restrictions people packed inside mask, touching things talking loudly.

* sports leisure activities allowed little restrictions.

* Social bubble rules mask wearing rules respected considerable amount people. little enforcement.

* People allowed travel asked self isolate come risky zone enforced.

Mid-November still insanely fast vaccine development. *good* news. thanks Federal government Murdoch media pushing Victoria reopen weeks. want let disease spread murder everybody's grandma, huh? Covid-denying psychopath!

I said nowhere post - putting words mouth. said actually thing did, ironically enough. Time hand notice sit things awhile. Cause we're third world country Gucci belt. know though, lot people may fall period recently read Fauci actually [good friend AIDS activist Larry feel like explains lot. science/data/understanding changes 

I think need stop there. inherent bias people position confirmed (COVID-bad, COVID-okay, science supports lockdowns, science support lockdowns) people generally stay position regardless overwhelming evidence contrary position. People generally like admit wrong without large mass people same. still says expects efficacy data late November, FDA requires lot enrolled must given second shot 2 months ago allow EUA believe? 

Which means US can’t go EUA efficacy data comes end month (hopefully), Health Canada EMA.  CDC published less 10k deaths actually covid.

Oh, jeeze, again? I'm sorry tell you, fallen propaganda. nice really don’t mean sound rude, please frame competition one come best? competition one another human lives discussed, points game. we’re teams sweden norway canada japan one another, we’re humanity covid. Yet people saying right brushing teeth important tooth decay myth people 99% chance losing teeth bother dental hygiene. conversation tradeoffs without lies. Yup, agree. It’s 8.2M “reported” infections. estimated 10 percent world’s population already Covid let’s assume 33M Covid US. bad estimate actually since wasn’t much testing early lot people asymptomatic.

If 10 percent already it, correct number fatalities would 2.2M EVERYONE infected. herd immunity, everyone infected actual number fatalities would drop around 1.6M get around 70-75 percent population infected.

This assumption vaccines going distributed. However several Phase 3 available public sometime late spring early summer 2021.

So let’s assume everyone mindset of, “Fuck shit, let’s herd immunity”, restrictions lifted, absolute worst case scenario come 1 million fatalities vaccine distribution. I’ve seen estimates we’ll hit 400k end year. allows another 600k cushion 2021 get vaccine.

Of course everyone take approach people still continue wear masks social distance. drop numbers around 500-600k time get vaccine.

Tldr; estimates way off! lucky 😀 Wrong, goggles must also worn face shields I've avoiding big family holidays years (my family toxic), I've able enjoy holidays again. Meh. Fear monger - problem- people using logic - it’s 8 months misinformation - random causes solutions CDC MSM cNN FOX - point try something new. tenn outside Nashville - one cared - noooooo one - old young black white cis gendered - nooo one. Kids school w mask - bars open - people living - logic would imply massive outbreak - right???? Well guess what? people - wasn’t sick - that’s - need starting thinking outside box don’t see anyone could trust govt media anymore course do, face shields meant worn goggles masks.... chances getting left stuffing drastic go down! /r/conservative way m’am... Republicans like: ""We want government oversight""

Also Republicans: ""We've installed operatives oversee, supervise micromanage everything ensure want regardless actual science says."" insist routine middle pandemic, go ahead take risk going gym. choice that's risk willing take fine. necessity.

When person commenting exercise good immune system battling covid, true, little nothing gyms. immune system boosting benefits achieved going jog outside. lifting weights home (you need heaviest weights) using body weight. let's bring argument gyms necessity due health benefits aren't. Gyms luxury people insist routines lifting heavy weights.  Americans use face masks, model's best-case scenario projects 314,000 deaths date. model, however, foresees 477,000 deaths mask mandates eased. 

So, say 477,000. There's amount death disease that's going convince fuckheads live wear mask. They've made part core identity. reason one person plate food. different going restaurant. Folkhälsomyndigheten: Baby aint til over

Cases increasing, abruptly like harder hit countries. Better ask Denmark increase halted last two weeks. CDC published less 10k deaths actually covid. addition, also published 85% people who’ve contracted covid, reported always wear mask wear mask majority time. point Exactly this. understand people saying ""oh can't China did, we're authoritarian"" but... Could followed Taiwan? That's exact thinking. Like get making progress getting swole absolutely sucks without gym pretty unrealistic maintain high muscle mass, but...that's extra. health benefits, say, achieved anywhere, really.

I would sympathetic, gym bros entitled people since pandemic began, fighting trying justify every step way. Actually, Norway closest neighbor common border hundreds miles long. Sweden's current 7 day moving average new cases twice Norway per capita basis. Check graph link Lmao swedes piss poor job lmao. can't dismiss everything anxiety. better look first saying that.  parents masters it, social distancing 15 years! 

No, seriously. I've celebrated several birthday parties since then. within maximum amount people allowed, open windows, seated different tables could minimise contact households. shudder thinking infection rates whole extended family sits together around one table, nice heated room closed windows, elbow elbow. Poster hasn’t tried purchase gym equipment home recently. THANK YOU! socialism. Science science man. I'm already this. point,let idiots understand anything scientific kill want to. Apparently mother nature tired many stupid people planet. not. wealthy country. lockdown March/April (which think necessary) absolutely necessary, quite clearly money support measures. would replace sanitizer soap comment. I'm sure countries similar playbooks documents. caught something last year suspect kind flu hit ***hard.*** I'm kind person never really gets sick badly, put order close 40 degrees celsius fever days. got felt drained energy another week. Getting flu jab year first time life. Woah. measurement numbers disturbing read. Sure, exceptional people, average, fat numbers. I’ve seeing fake ads state Trump claiming it’s control Fauci claiming “I don’t think anyone could more”. Unreal nonsense spilled try tease us Americans. called dinner immediate family people live with. time go visit aunt karen another state dinner. 

You think citizens get virus means spread others. means apart problem. think gyms pretty essential mental health since lots people resources home set up. 

Look contract tracing data Louisiana. far know, that's state releases data like that. need close bars restaurants first. consistently lead spread. Closing anything else would silly. Exactly.

This outdoors 18x safer. think confused dr. Fauci Trump global economy many companies setup shop us. sustain profits must constant supply cheap immigrant laborers. can't justify importing cheap immigrant laborers huge unemployment. solution let working class die. continuation typical process brainwashing working class communities procreating via ethnic violence promoted rewarded media. white supremacy literally part immigration policy key ensuring white minority communities state unrest lead low birthrates. Cartage Least prepared calling prepared...how american you.

Large nation can't shut state traffic whatever reason. I'm assuming China shut borders provinces. Nations big states shut borders. 

That shit healthcare system supreme court judge can't quit job cancer needs insurance.

The stupidity alarming. 

If another nation wanted destroy America, I'd keep making viruses transfer wealth America health industry watch America kill itself. implying Sweden heard immunity strategy wrong.

No, true, even deny it.

What end game? wanted slow spread.... why? purpose? purpose prevent hospitals overloaded until... what?

Were expecting virus magically disappear? certainly relying vaccine made clear see vaccine developed time soon...

So expect ultimate outcome be?

Clearly, wanted slow rate infection hospitals overwhelmed natural herd immunity reduced number infections brought epidemic halt.

Herd immunity ultimate goal along. simply want admit it. Trump. many preventable deaths free society worth? didn’t lie masks idiot. told people wear n95 masks due shortage thought going happen..Literally remember watching said myself. necessary? ""uncivil"" prove wrong. Hilarious.

Your failure problem. Next time, learn subject prior commenting. think minimum UK peaked 160,000 infections day. Belgium almost certainly 20,000 infections day March. Yep. amount hard work overcome incompetent leadership. Fed literally bought MTA bonds keep transit system around NYC going bankrupt allow refi debt Herd immunity government never let millions people die like that. expect social restrictions effective vaccine comes manage convince enough people get think so, positive testing rate rises too. surge already started since August schools still closed almost tourism present. come everyone dies virus always martyr saint? fault putting position infected? think US get Darwin Award claimed promises pre-election vaccine.

I proved wrong. Yeah same, mine scabbed over. n95 nose ends bloody too.

Wonder anyone gotten nose job fix “Roman nose mask interference” lol exercise COVID? fever know you’re supposed raise temperature, light exercise. Like yoga Pilates? Lol, really feel sorry you. uncivil pompous. I'm going waste time talking you. never done first place. probably matter time unless somehow slow spread. free society distrust government many benefits.

I first misread last word ""dick"" man ever appropriate take US position world affairs. still acknowledge screwed up.

You claimed promises made vaccine prior US election.

I proved wrong. There's way walk back. Sorry admit blew it. Can't drive across road? thought like Finland-Sweden border.  think reason test now, 1000 cases comparable 1000 cases peak, probably 10x back then. Better treatments also helps pointed people still end hospital since better treatment available home, summer europe cases, deaths low. lot people going die cold field tents surrounded hundreds sick dying people, family around. Sad shit. US, actually mean Republicans black man tried help us, right? Stfu, dude. care him. it?!... virus care people squished big groups? sure that's relevant. like Poland's population like 1/10th US something ...and vote future elections! Preventing bad judges getting lower levels keep moving higher levels bad rulings even damage individuals society large. going acknowledge screwed up.

Go ask Dear Leader Trump describing.  #***GOP****andemic!*

Any questions? point people rural communities unlikely know someone personally died covid, know someone knows someone distribution deaths equal across population, clustered around urban centers. think far likely someone lives 10 miles urban center know someone know someone died, someone 100+ miles away. Whether someplace 20 miles outside Cincy considered rural urban completely besides point. define rural however want, I'm tried pedantic bullshit I'm going continue discussion care. I'll explain two words:

Donald Trump RemindMe! 2 months Likely combination better treatments, less-severe cases due lower viral viral loads (increased distancing/mask-wearing), young people getting before, lower hospitalizations (at least summer early fall) meaning individual patients serious cases could get attention. Twas none Post Malone No, don't. 7-10 day rule basically universal, sick week start recover take turn worse.  compare Sweden EU average US 150% cases per capita. Sweden good right now. carefull probably end situation. vaccine it, dude? Sputnik? Pfizer? Oof. Yeah, I'm rocking ear loop surgical mask head-strap n95. Top ears get worst days. wish best luck! why. I'm done talking sense you. /u/tb0x Also recommend watching ""The Brainwashing Dad"" **Background:** Severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection disproportionately affected older individuals underlying medical conditions. Research focused short-term outcomes hospital, single organ involvement. Consequently, impact long COVID (persistent symptoms three months post-infection) across multiple organs low-risk individuals yet assessed. Methods: ongoing prospective, longitudinal, two-centre, observational study performed individuals symptomatic recovery acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. Symptoms organ function (heart, lungs, kidneys, liver, pancreas, spleen) assessed standardised questionnaires (EQ-5D-5L, Dyspnoea-12), blood investigations quantitative magnetic resonance imaging, defining single multi-organ impairment consensus definitions. Findings: April September 2020, 201 individuals (mean age 44 (SD 11.0) years, 70% female, 87% white, 31% healthcare workers) completed assessments following SARS-CoV-2 infection (median 140, IQR 105-160 days initial symptoms). prevalence pre-existing conditions (obesity: 20%, hypertension: 6%; diabetes: 2%; heart disease: 4%) low, 18% individuals hospitalised COVID-19. Fatigue (98%), muscle aches (88%), breathlessness (87%), headaches (83%) frequently reported symptoms. Ongoing cardiorespiratory (92%) gastrointestinal (73%) symptoms common, 42% individuals ten symptoms. **There evidence mild organ impairment heart (32%), lungs (33%), kidneys (12%), liver (10%), pancreas (17%), spleen (6%). Single (66%) multi-organ (25%) impairment observed**, significantly associated risk prior COVID-19 hospitalisation (p&lt;0.05). **Interpretation: young, low-risk population ongoing symptoms, almost 70% individuals impairment one organs four months initial symptoms SARS-CoV-2 infection.** implications burden long COVID also public health approaches assumed low risk young people comorbidities. France 30k, equivalent 150k U.S. looking good. going acknowledge screwed up. average vaccine takes decade develop.

The fastest development time new vaccine prior four years.

How would vaccine developed one year rushed? favorite thing something along lines ""did hear (opposite political party) did...."" proceed tell relatively unknown sensational story, get worked up, he's blathering awful is, arrested (or worse) etc etc finally calms i'm like ""ooh, know what? actually (his political party) that"" suppose GOP legislators could work branches Government (governor) come policy, would require actually communicating working others opposed slapping gavel want they'll probably goal nothing

I made anonymous complaint county, sure they’ll actually anything half people don’t know wear masks. missing one major thing - gyms community. can't take away people. seem social person. Uhhh yeah that’s pretty much exactly works. never said didn’t give **** countries. Making statistical point know saying: It’s better need it; need it. That’s happened Pandemic Response Team dissolved orange stain White House. would compare Trump’s usefulness wall leaning against... except wall giving asshole wall learn reflect much asshole truly Well Republicans  ignore that?  surprise backlash claim one promised vaccine prior US presidential election?

How acknowledging blatant screwup? said wear masks advocating reduction restrictions mask mandates nationally nowhere near enough enforced locally. WH favoring Koch bro funded Great Barrington Declaration precludes future ""lockdown"" restrictions favors herd immunity strategy. He's trying sneak reduction restrictions plea bare minimum lot gullible people falling Christie's ruse. 

When even call national mandate? saw telling people wear masks mealy mouthing POTUS stance. survived unfetted access availabke treatments rarely offered Americans.... equal,  important thing note people produce robust immune responses antibodies lasting 5-7 months minimum based currently available data.

SARS antibodies lasted 2-3 years average, that's good reference point. Let’s admit underlying assumptions terrible entire duration virus. Seems like they're trying set ashes fire well. Fauci said virus doesn’t infect people face 3ft ground less, we’d see people yard sticks rolling around skateboards INSTANTLY, without question. Spared? serious? 2,482 cases last three days.

Here list top 20 highest number cases single day:

Out 20 days highest number new cases, 2 (10%) happened last three days.

And claiming ""spared"" second wave? distribution February, timeline EUA December, starting work distribution December? That's good hear, current genocidal policies?

We're talking basically Nazi-level criminality. really case Czech republic. enforcing masks one first counties. virus control.
 
Then summer arrived, everyone get travel countries vacation, reopening..

 Problem government, tests supplies. People sew masks home, themselves, government nothing. Testing capacity bad even now, 6 months everything started.

As Czech citizen living US, feel bad family. hope stay healthy. Nice straw man. Los Angeles 285' sea level. one saying water due climate change. Flying used nice... Can’t believe got downvote  fine lockdown. several platforms, there’s official governmental platform. I’m sure OP making false claims. Christian saving thoughts prayers die since works mass shootings. right? Amazon needs lots people pull orders non-stop $15/hour. Anyone this, rigors job unknown join. turnover rate ludicrous. simply replace everyone can't hack someone can(at least little while). Over-supplied often synonym easily-replaced. job require no/little training replacement require no/little training well. Could probably get agreement principle... ""If gets elected we'll pay damned wall."" wish we’d open nyc one years... volunteered doesn’t mean received actual vaccine. actually think I’m going hit places class! considering going Edinburgh apparently one great (x6) grandfathers buried actually read paper complicated that.

People predetermined robots. 'always know that', no, knowledge gained somewhere.

This knowledge.

Ie someone grow young age someone else see indoctrinate them, perhaps even intentionally deceiving believe 'waco religion'.

At young age, understanding whats going on, perhaps someone come smiling tell ridiculous fantasy true, intentionally lying -- deceiver acting 'friendly', perhaps victim see corrupt, deceiver leading get sucked mountain nonsense. person later grows believing fantasy see tech young people..

Regardless, anyone got sucked fantasy -- actually reach show fantasy false, never true begin with, made up, perhaps help mountain nonsense. stop continuation nonsense. beat up, ignore them, leaving suffer -- no, imagine, living life like you, help logic dispel fantasy. Actually friend.

&amp;#x200B;

Theft, many reasons. Someone starving need food perhaps steal food live..

Perhaps someone starving time cant really put much effort critical thinking thus maybe hurt people. that's pretty much much energy think they're doing.

Someone blind, obviously cannot see, say they're stupid, put implant hooks directly brain digital camera see perhaps. Help see.. perhaps eyes replaced fixed help see.

So, make statement 'that's reason happens', simple explanation - rather, much could going on, multiple uncertain factors perhaps. Oh, I've Costco. That's second closest one house. fuck Tsingtao ?!?!?!? Don’t get excited. Presumably vulnerable already got it. NY numbers went way slight rise... Yes. 
Just imagine taxing billionaires, whole new world. point put people camps call good? helps live place lots old people. store garner fair amount business would go competitors area.

Also, places US: Walmart Maybe true don’t want involved. Cuomo tried get involved “reimagining” NYC schools. No...please stay away. Everyone hates remote learning don’t need someone who’s going push technology remote learning kids need attention people DOD vested interest trying prevent Boeing aerospace companies collapsing. exactly neutral party issue. anybody ability think critically 


Is wonder things seem awry?

We swim sea confusion think survive

So nobody fools running around walmart day mask :(. Figures. Yeah that's kind deal viruses...they magically dissappear. spread whenever, wherever possibly can. Stopped Lifetime check saw several people wearing masks nose chin diapers strenuous lifting. noped put membership hold. one banning home schooling. He’s making stuff up. See reply &amp; disregard guy says, clearly agenda push. people Paris still randomly pee everywhere streets? Last time almost got peed guy pissing balcony. Well least there’s ongoing investigation french ministry Health &amp; former Prime minister, regarding lack preparation &amp; failure react initial stages pandemic. 
Their homes &amp; offices searched today. sure anything come it, least someone’s looking it. sub? Can't say blame Canada there. want anti-maskers near either. Feel free message like understand difference ""religious right"" scientist definitely understands stem cells. I'm comfortable differences different. limited amount CARES Act funds. enough go around every single person. people already laid off, need immediate assistance..

Now Las Vegas used CARES funds improperly, Las Vegas going give money people ALREADY lost jobs? People can't pay rent job loss, living street? people need buy groceries families RIGHT NOW, money? sit around weeks Las Vegas ""somehow"" finds way replace CARES money used up? Las Vegas given actual time-frame long going take replace money? guess Mom lost job needs feed kids needs wait! doesn't? Kidney cells differentiated cells. Embryonic stem cells still posses possibility life. HEK cells ever turn kidney. Embryonic stem cell research (the thing banned) frowned upon embryos obtained experimented on. Embryos right now, differentiated kidney cells 1973. see difference hard grasp. Stem cell research banned. Talk like cause people less careful. need hope. Healthcare workers see data minorities face disproportionate risk healthcare. Healthcare workers beginning confront structural racism interferes ability heal patients. 

Unlike Fox News fans, understand two bad things world once. So, us decided best given situation. wore masks, stood 6 feet apart held signs limit risk dying COVID also trying reduce risk dying black. incredibly incorrect. I'd interested see single epidemiologist would agree estimate. likely factor 10 more. Woah woah, actually analyzing article claims?? allowed, mister! You’re supposed gratuitously claim over, vaccine neither effective safe, reinfections actually common friend’s cousin’s wife’s sister got reinfected. General consensus among reddit wait 3 weeks see outcome current cases. We’ll better idea maybe make comparisons. goal ""somewhat normal"" think likely get that. Fauci says (vaccination April) likely best case scenario. even scenario vaccinated enough herd immunity summer, still going significant portion population probably level almost everything going allowed. thank god, another reasonable person... life impacted, think problem virus, people worried virus. Well thats awfully convenient Canada it? use us barrier play greater card. Macron isn’t banning homeschooling know it. He’s introducing law religious-based organizations disguising schools, children forced pray &amp; read Coran day without actual teaching taking place &amp; without french language. nothing Covid please don’t propagate false facts. Risklayer collects data local health departments soon made public, RKI updates day (and likely uses different cut-off time). RKI's update released reported 7,334 new cases. flipside, turns Big Boss Ok least agree something.

But gets 1/10 stars though opposed 0 every republican.

At least might convince others opinion. Stem cells theoretically lead human life whereas kidney cells already differentiated. Embryonic stem cell research frequently uses fresh embryos harvest. can't see difference immortalized cell line 70s harvesting embryo 2020, convo pointless. Another Canadian here. fine without hockey. downvoted even 50% effective vaccine would blessing disaster. Yeah difficult compare waves since couldn’t test much March. Nevertheless number cases concerning. want wait line El Toro Six Flags Great Adventure, don’t care it’s packed. Feel better -- American way

*If believe made mistake, please [message moderators](/message/compose?to=/r/Coronavirus).* Save cheerleader, save world. couldn’t argument made cold, flu, measles, smallpox, etc? mean, thing still exist. Smh. Welcome Costco, I.....*cough*....love you

Welcome Costco, I.....*cough*....love you’re listening, im bothering either. Pisses off. bunch us high risk people essential workers. super high risk spouse home. Herd immunity amounts death sentence lot us, already bad right now. every older high risk person afford ride home, guarantees young healthy get permanent damage worse well. trading genuine human interaction. I'm saying worth time, especially vaccine way. 

But give impression okay everyone wearing masks rest lives. foregoing human facial expression emotions brings somehow really issue end day. 

If general opinion, adamantly disagree. Let clear: *absence* effective vaccine (vaccines effective), think humans wearing masks presence strangers, friends family, appropriate trade given lives save. worth loss humanity community.

To extend this, need *years* mask wearing, say additional 3 years, also think worth it. that's probably different ethically.

I'm right now, long term. grey zone cost-benefit society. Thanks info, link outlines / herd immunity achieved via MMR though?

Also NSW stats says 2/3 cases unvaccinated, means 1/3 vaccinated. herd immunity achieved large amount people immune still contracting disease? wearing nose bullshit.

Outdoors ok right? indoors it’s fully on. Mass testing aside, reason success Qingdao early discovery initial 12 man cluster thanks vigilante testing hospital.

Every patient getting hospitalised China first tested COVID-19. index case event guy needed hospitalised tuberculosis chest hospital. negative then. treatment discharged days, another days came back hospital second round treatment tested COVID-19 that's tested positive.

Because two tests fairly close immediately clued may outbreak hospital itself.

This regular testing high risk areas professions necessary monitoring. Highs -3c next days Sask. Snow ground today. 

Living vehicle next couple weeks too..... conceive think Fauci jumped shark summer. Cuomo. keep going onto tv nothing substantial update on, makes people think covid over. Otherwise...you'd giving actual update. Anecdotes. enlightening. hope individual stories like one shape national public health policy, comely teenage cheerleaders short breath. God forbid. COVID 19.126.458 Release Notes

- Tweaking spikes better attachment ACE-2 receptors
- Fixed bug hosts continued fully functional cerebrum infection
- Per user request, changing behavior attach mask fabric facilitate reinfection host's breath case, half people reddit would showing well. think ""countless"" studies ""say reinfection rare"", kinda mark. Definetly good find something completely effective.

Just annoys reported ineffective effect. headline coming nationwide winter.  Pretty much every country amount refugee immigration.

Canada's neighbor US, rather prosperous country. US's southern neighbor issues prosperity security, especially regions closest border, neighbor's neighbors also issues. 

I'm sure many Canadians would welcome poor world showing front door large numbers, simply case. can't really compare it.

There's also fact point critical sectors US economy rely migrant labor (both documented undocumented). Hard crack without throwing lot stuff disarray. gonna closed years huh? Understandable. Koch taps Trump's head: 'Can't fail controlling virus goal spread virus.' Companies finally opportunity get rid B players replace players. pay membership fee opportunity get Vaccine might bullet proof though. Mask measures probably better. try, won’t fly. Christiana Delaware nurses talking repeat patients. south one. infected early March (Boeing) came again. Asthmatic pulmonary conditions. wife also infected (from him) March still really good antibody titers. Proud? No. Pride one feels someone right thing. someone wrong thing, eventually backtracks realizes he's hurting himself. people never middle seat. there's food beverages consumed plane defeats mask use turns setting unlike bar restaurant. That's exactly feels like I'm guessing troop movements much risk sending personnel around country/world that's imo study limited. flying company going get away wearing mask wrong wearing one all. Man, imagine TSA lines 6ft distancing? actually pretty hard get enough Vitamin diet alone. Unless eat lot fish, milk eggs 
 even add orange juice added, enough (about 800) alone enough winter months. Tabernac!!!  time break old sayings spring, unfortunately. 

""Just stay fuck home."" Sad scary. Wonder get long terms effects - everyone know someone died...congrats. blamed smart people. Trump Thinking world run evil cabal shapeshifting satanists busy enacting machiavellian plan far less depressing realisation people fucking us greedy, greasy grifters managed succeed thanks ignorance apathy public.

I understand many find conspiracies attractive: intellectual equivalent junk food, give illusion understanding.
CTs give satisfying narrative makes actions feel meaningful clearly divide world good evil. agree. probably frame perspective ""the largest economy richest country"", would make failure even ironic given much President brags stock market. comparing model official death toll, right? question much undercount? read, 415,000 January totally reasonable estimate actual deaths. They're right one thing. numbers accurate. 

They're likely **higher** say is. Nope China subject. fucking China. bad troll. change subject. worlds China problem.

Fuck China contributions beginning world wide pandemic. Fuck next iteration well. know ALWAYS matter time.


Report findings collective manipulators misinformed. Summit county checking in, work Cuyahoga. Everywhere go almost 100% mask compliance. Occasionally gas station someone doesn’t care part I’ve pleasantly surprised people care. Thing is, spreading fastest rural areas. almost like soap claims get rid 99% germs bacteria wonder number would national mask mandate free masks free testing everywhere. CDC director still job? predict global death toll corona Nov 1 somewhere 1 million 100 million dead.

If number falls two values, correct. Junk science I'm bit confused, signed there, statements scientists signed declaration false? actually need get epidemiologists sign it, scientists prestigious universities. begin understand maybe mass death event? multiple millions die can't much it?

No isn't. infections disease still mild produce strong immune responses. Vaccinations give recipients immune response strong patients discharged ICU. provide considerably protection longer time protect severe disease. Nearly cases reinfection we've seen initial mild disease.

What we're seeing immune response mild disease completely insufficient herd immunity, vaccinations still need yearly schedule probably next decade so.

(and herd immunity also always table, nail coffin) would love tag filter filter US posts Flatten curve. literally goal. 

How people forgotten this? 

Meanwhile Europe catching up.... Heh... seems FHM still gaming numbers... So? aunt year older far know underlying conditions age. active even wheel chair yet. Yeah, outlier, always outliers.

Eventually rather survivors current pandemic become genetically ""immune"" extent another winter's cold them.
Just like happened S.American natives columbus brought flu them.

Are back already? people learn lesson saying every single day entire month June. July, deaths went back 1000 per day; like everyone telling you. news Bill Gates emailed me
From fucking Gmail account time tell wanted give $5m can. best pandemic plan put place inept, crooked, greedy assholes felt important hold power. Hmm no, per capita US 150% cases per death rate significantly lower compared March (see NY compared Florida/Texas). silver bullet, treatments inching forward. Also one like others. “The problem shitty leadership shitty spending.”

Which weren’t prepared. people keep voting touch stupid corporate shills warhawks bought overpaid fed elitists care lining pockets. can't see saying Terrible Response Undeniably Magnified Pandemic considered political point. science statistics says fact. like saying ""masks help reduce spread disease"" political.  ""Fast testing disease helps contain it"". ""International coordination helps pandemic"". ""Misinformation spread top officials"". I'm sure get I'm going this. Yes, looks like data evaluate risk, still number people like That's whole system Serbia joke. can't get test unless cough plus fever 38.5 several days. Meaning severe cases get registered ruin anything, let small number far right types ruin old legendary Norse symbolism that's stupid. people think Pepe Frog used undesireables.

Shame you. man, seen news recently? Someone Europe contracted virus 60 days first time died. like choosing ignore people get twice deadly. Even believe herd immunity feasible, willing sit back let people die. ask me, pretty fucked matter look it. like even subscribe idea life valuable. Convenient ignore country's shortcomings. keep pointing fingers, tapping heels together wishing better country nearly quarter million dead happen. They're Republicans. Sociopathy baked in.  Sure hand washing might work laboratory. evidence hand washing works reduce corona whole population. hand washing give people false sense security.

Not saying herd immunity impossible without vaccines article extra context point.



Small scale definetly possible, I'd rather risk highly infectious, deadly disease fair, first wave March-May testing done. Even though 1-2 week lag, ICU admissions tells much better objective story. wave? Maybe. Maybe not. early tell. currently Russia? yes, share, current vaccination status is. Weeks ago always articles Russia planning vaccinate population fast/possibly rushed vaccin october. October, know happening right got delayed? one saying ignore it. might Swedish Tegnell trolls head makes say it, still. Fair deal. many non mild symptomatic infections take take effect? mild infections (for now) irreversible damage lungs. 

Yeah that‘s right. also 89. think getting infected twice short amount time think many persons immunocompromised time one reinfection. May another disease, treatment like chemotherapy accident. ViOlAtIoN maH rIgHtS WeAr MaSk

You want serious answer? Government afraid put foot actually lead us enforcing mask social distancing laws. They're greedy they're willing let people die covid, keep allowing citizens exert ""freedoms"" citizens keep paying increasingly expensive taxes. Everything world designed, way, profit rich. Who's source? That's great news! guess know sure end month. I've noticed since began virus along human stupidity quickly made reach pass death projections. surprised see official numbers 200k winter. #freedums Ok, right. person investigated political bias comes subject. review past studies. 

...And includes debunked Santa Clara study part data. shows cannot trust this. Yup, South Korea. Check /r/COVID19Positive - hard say common is, symptoms go away. Also anecdotes people recovered sense taste/smell get messed months later. Op talking math wanted extrapolate data. actual linear graph linear algebra integration area curves, actually fairly advanced mathematics. It’s calc 1, consider calculus advanced maths. course look see difference without quantitate. good thing find draw attention .   Texas hospitals ever get overrun? seemed prepared. matters define prepared German's generally trust government advice. 

Distrust government pretty much built entirety America's culture. One word.  ***TRUMP*** Yeah well richer billionaires, so... pretty close zero chance solid way think it. 
My worst case plausible remains dormant flare causing person become infectious again. Bad take. Soap best choice, hand sanitizer close second.  Yes EU 150% higher., US 150% higher. Mostly lot A_mer_icans it. Yeahhhhhh.... Article 1000 character limit. Here's fucking hoping! outrageous accusations sub, please. big chunk population doomed $250 higher unexpected bill many corporations running way, figure US best prepared? part post “attestation physician”

But following sentence approach misses deaths people died seeing doctor people misses people died things like pneumonia, stroke heart attacks without tested Covid.

Well, .. approach ""miss people"" died seeing doctor, died things. Deaths ""probably"" attributed Covid posthumously.  heading fast toward another lockdown. want positive, feels dire abysmal right now. April 2021 another universe. hard enough get week point, let alone another six months.

We're halfway October approaching higher peaks (U.S.) point far. even cold yet. Thanksgiving massacres coming up, *know* people halting family gatherings large enough scale matter, plus Christmas, idk, man. seems bleak. private bathtub? Yes. even thought would then, anyways. evading point Somebody's jealous wasted years spending time relatives hated, many cases. air force one? airport though? That's whole issue.

### They’re pretty good. 

👏 Trump GOP looking ahead next Gov's race. want shots people suffering dying say, ""SEE! That's happens Dems Gov..."" source that? Cant find one Google

Edit: see investigation mean now. actually different study Santa clara residents one linked Stocks teetering another drop. Gotta keep pumping. [citation needed] Mass protests left, people right refuse wear masks, college party animals. Except that's said all... Every place hospitals got overwhelmed much higher death rate average. unwise assume death rate would increase drastically let er rip. 

8 million deaths realm possibilities nothing. god you’re pathetic person plan reopen working intended. knew coming, watching Corona stuff since like January. is. remotely true. BS DoD doesnt want troops orders get scared orders get plane ticket next duty station. I'm student I'm talking work. us work bedroom grind pandemic believe I'll well aware everything saying applies school universally applyable everyone That’s real problem isn’t it. We’ve become divided extreme ones among us home, think are, viewed majority. Trump 100% compliance protocols. Seems like army researchers never fly commercial. virus divided friends family many.

I laid detailed plan visiting family, stepmother, private Facebook post. response: welcome anytime. sneezing coughing wash hands upon entry. Love you. 

She refuses get it. 

We huge blowout last time there. Dad said would Labor Day picnic outside. show folks, youngest almost 60, inside smug ass faces. stepmother banging surface transmission, aunt refused hear single word reality. face walked out. 

It surreal drive back, too. fires raging Front Range Denver &amp; Cheyenne, downright apocalyptic. I'm certain entirely true. Elderly people huge part Republican base long time. Hearing young people party willing sacrifice elderly people's lives sake economy go well many them. Keep granny safe indoors then... visit full hazmat suit whatever precautions need take. 

Maybe even talk see wants spend last years life. Maybe she'll consider risk getting infected battling virus bearable prolonged social isolation.

If people denigrate go back living life normally there's minimal harm themselves, really expect give prime life granny? peoples opinions around live still, 'oh well gonna get eventually, big deal' That’s said. said WIDELY available then. There’s difference ready widely available. 1. evolutionary pressure virus become less lethal. would something like ebola. However, COVID-19, little evolutionary benefit becoming less lethal. kills old fecund. 

2. Modern influenza thinned Spanish flu. random chance, another H1N1 strain influenza much lethal current strains. disagree. current president shut pandemic office outbreak. Therefore, U.S. world' best-prepared nation. Especially considering populations developing countries tend younger US healthcare system one. health profit system killed probably hundreds thousands last decades. get bankrupted nosebleed. way hell ever prepared. work, never would've matter party president is. uphold monstrously inhumane system. Early voting showing opposite effect. People pissed trump gop waiting hours hours vote. let's keep complaining internet people luxury anymore Table 1 paper (linked above) details characteristics enrolled. 
35% 50 years old
45% 50 69
19% 70
While understand thoughts essentially says ""smokers die younger thus would expected under-represented older COVID patients"", would note enrolled significant number patients 70 (80% patients 70 years old).
I still find 7% figure odd. Especially look data (also linked above) showing many countries trial enrolled, adult smoking prevalence excess 30%. Congratulations! blessed realm sleep. data infection environments still controversial.

That recent US DOD study, studies plane superspreading first wave, whatnot.

So 100% right, better data, way go. almost like code post... This'll tough one crack! 🕵 That's true. would daunting task. I'm almost 40, we're talking 50, paying back loans. really love science medicine. way Trump says, ""I know much, doctors impressed"", that's actually me. Biology always clicked head. chemistry amazing well. micro level, life series chemical reactions. I've thought teaching well hate public speaking. one thing true. always kind, help people need it, question answer happy explain something someone, making learning experience interesting fun. immediate penalty wearing mask hundreds pushups long term penalties disobeying superior officer demotion, withholding pay, courts martial i'm sure nearly impossible get covid plane.

when flight stewards care, bet lot possible Fauci say lol Yes, well, like could've predicted go well. like Western power tried thing failed miserably. estimated less 10 percent population contracted COVID. need around 60 percent achieve heard immunity. far away heard immunity right now, getting place would mean hundreds thousands additional people die. can't call pussies, depth warmth amazes species sent moon fail spectacularly viral outbreak. Well Trump keeps actively shit talking masks, even he's COVID. Like Savannah Gurthie said, president suppose setting example, instead openly says, wear mask, don't... Trump idiot act, occasion, worse last, little worse. wait next next. wait one great shocking occasion, thinking others, shock comes, join resisting somehow. don’t want act, even talk, alone; don’t want ‘go way make trouble.’ not?—Well, habit it. fear, fear standing alone, restrains you; also genuine uncertainty.   one great shocking occasion, tens hundreds thousands join you, never comes. *That’s* difficulty. last worst act whole regime come immediately first smallest, thousands, yes, millions would sufficiently shocked.... course isn’t way happens. come hundreds little steps, imperceptible, preparing shocked next. Step C much worse Step B, and, make stand Step B, Step C? Step D.  one day, late, principles, ever sensible them, rush upon you. burden self-deception grown heavy, minor incident... collapses once, see everything, everything, changed changed completely nose. world live in—your nation, people—is world born all. forms there, untouched, reassuring, houses, shops, jobs, mealtimes, visits, concerts, cinema, holidays. spirit, never noticed made lifelong mistake identifying forms, changed

[\-They Thought States working other, states working federal government, cities working state policies, law enforcement refusing support state governmental decrees, violent resistance governmental mandates, constant infighting republicans democrats local, state federal levels, executive branch refuses listen experts.

Basically- Republican party denial, voters denial, POTUS stoking divisions rather inspiring unity. Ok. go look world data eorldometers yourself. example new cases per capita rolling 7 day average. supposed show? CH SE population Sweden half cases. So? guess we're useless. 2words Donald trump RemindMe! eoy said, “Wait till Fall.” right. US death toll north 217K. This, gutted powers, stop giving orders, people starting, GOP blame lack leadership, swear half voters country walk around heads sand. 2017 Case numbers useless. 

They give us trend-lines. exactly useless. Congress didn’t exercise Article 1 power concerning habeaus corpus bc individual congressmen bunked war session. 

Lincoln’s argument basically frustration purpose. Another antimask denialist troll trying start circle jerk saying stupid shit. Go away. know seems surprising America's image, intensely predictable.

In 1980 Ronald Reagan elected, one goals offload previously much CDC's work states. 50 concurrent programs hard enough coordinate, every state even works same-some states break counties even cities, others not. Much still go CDC point, makes many things slower operate.  


Health departments easy targets budget cuts. public health systems working, they're invisible public government officials often absolutely idea goes within them. America never nation invest prevention, see services health departments offer, like flu shot clinics free oral care low income kids, handouts, want pay them. they've slashed years-particularly states led ""small government"" folks, really little bit everywhere.

 
Now couple sick leave policies, anti-science leader, intense resistance supporting folks stay home, obsession individual liberty. course going fail. Thanks haha - literally half-asleep wrote that. (Some doomscrolling getting bed.) pretty hilarious all-time highest-rated comment. :) Truly perplexing system. Almost say? Challenge accepted! exactly needs come federal government. states can't run deficit like federal government can, puts particularly tough position A.) budgets increase due COVID-19 response B.) revenue decreases economic downturn. perfect storm lot states needs sort coordinated response federal government. Well that’s silly, last checked every country needed doctors goodness thread downvoted? ruins reputation sub. Graphs axis comparison? Really?
And, confirmed cases says nothing, since testing super low levels March May. 

In Sweden’s case, means level mid-late June, pretty ok compared March/April. 

Not downplaying negative trend Sweden seeing, a) graphs say nothing, b) situation far much Europe. now. absolutely correct saying that. likely due fact Donald Trump downplayed want panic people. want in-depth discussion issue r/Politics posts including town hall last night brought up. Elections consequences, simple  even trying anymore. allegations senicide, mass murder herd immunity devil Tegnell himself?I disappointed Rona U Made Possible going blame fault.

She could worked legislature develop policies deal this. 8 months since President Trump put first travel ban place. Everyone knew unilateral power grab would shut court. plenty time put real solution place. People isolate ""wrong"" (say hi neighbor!), bring asymptomatic case house. Unlikely, possible. 

&amp;#x200B;

We need find bubbles, deal bit boredom, come spring ready start opening process again. amazing. Absolutely it. someone regrets going back school who's job affected covid, it. Especially family yet. look back seeing anti science many people are, heck want become one? 

Don't listen dumb minority, listen 70% supports science, even ones fence. ok, obviously restaurants still stay open business. point take useful measures possible smallest disruption. said, possible right. We'll see France 9pm curfew. great life too. opinions zero bearing anything especially view life. Phew, one’s good! Truly Reprimandable Useless Maggot Proselytizm idiots scum made political. Everyone anyone get feee rest whenever want it.

Trump biggest failure everyone understand. Herd immunity euphemism. better sounding name ""go die ones left die much"".

People need stop pretending pursuing ""strategy"". actually alternative strategies available, weighed options, selected ""herd immunity"". No, incompetent stupid leadership screwed up, stupid come implement strategy would save country, shrug shoulders rebranded screw ""herd immunity"". That's America 2020. actually understand 88 year old it. He's 88, he's already living borrowed time. want spend hiding house?

Not saying smart, understand mindset. *could* happen *Wisconsin enters chat* Turns electing idiot president actual consequences. knew? dont NEED lift super heavy weights. really talking mental physical benefits exercise buy weights (that heavy enough) use home, including barbell different sets weights use body weight. go run outside. many options. things provide boost endorphins physical nourishment body. Lifting 600 lb weights gym going anything boost immune system help risk getting severely ill covid. No, don't. nothing. Remdesivir recently revealed make almost difference (after governments bought lots it).

It summer. Long term couples treated extended family exception. apply Canadian notarize relationship, though. two week quarantine arrival. whole argument ""we treat better"" ""we know now"" complete garbage, reason deaths lower summer.

We know anything, way treat (remdesivir recently turned worthless), winter comes right back. sure would acting way current 'plague' 30%+ fatality rate.

It's comparing apples oranges. Religion = Wacko 300RMB = $44.79 USD need gym though? exact physical mental health benefits achieved working outside home, without risks going gym Fuck avoiding family gathering like that. Swedes still live normal life we're fine. don’t entirely blame actually. COVID misinformation misunderstanding rampant. Outside subreddit, think many people think place building, you’re free take mask off. believe myth came restaurants. average person falls hygiene theater impressed wipes hand sanitizer six feet. 

At workplace (I don’t go, I’m working home), people free take masks room alone, someone enters room, they’re supposed put mask back on. It’s like someone peeing pool, someone else gets in, stop peeing. 

People simply don’t understand, unless made concerted effort understand. still ratio bad American. quarantined first ran money so, theyre closing schools made masks mandatory outside. wanna get tested wait quarantine symptoms exposed home-based kits good official test. Taiwan lot fishy things look even tiny bit past relentless self promotion need gym exercise. 

Pre-covid gym every day. Like you, gone 6 months. I'm best shape life. started running outside hiking. Bought weights strength training home. subscribed lot online workout programs, including live demand group fitness classes. 

You get plenty exercise, definitely enough boost immune system, home outside. essential mechanic nuclear engineer drive car? Fuck avoiding family gathering like that. Swedes still living pretty normal life we're fine. Hook Totally agree. *looks Europe, India, &amp; US*

This bot wants find best worst bots Reddit. [You view results reply comment, I'm still listening votes. Check webpage see vote registered!) Speaking Germany, I'm surprised - see daily workplace people give fuck wearing masks all, least third wear like work like miracle. 
Also many seem like they've never heard something like ""social distancing"" all...

It get worse. Good bot really helps start assuming something can't done.  There's still plenty people saying worse flu.  r/woosh Simple.

The flu kills ~60k people restrictions, wfh, business closures, 100k+ people events.

Covid killed ~200k+ less year (we still another ~4 months go lap thing) that's extraordinary shutdown measures. Live life want live it. Make risk determination decide. 


Sounds pretty low risk, live old people, would personally it. far many variables difference countries populations way early make conclusions leadership anything particular outcome. long vaccine tested humans for?

My concern side effects, rare otherwise, known months years road Gee wonder, could governing party run NeoNazi fascists probably see opportunity profit market volatility bullshit especially farfetched believe virus meant target ruin US economy. least one scientific study says covid-19 engineered virus multiple sources confirm affects obese people extra hard. Add grotesque things China's prepared lately internment camps, organ harvesting, Hong Kong, Tibet on. like people like assume it’s “brigaded astroturfed”, real people back reality, sick continuous bullshit goalpost moving. try reading learning article, that’s you’re stereotypical [science  WEAR MASK OBEY

/s Yes? Uhhh. Hold on. Lemme check something.

Its troll account looks it. 

Congrats anyone got baited. Report move on.

By way. 
Most states trending requiring mask public, proper sanitation, pushing social distancing measures, outdoor dining, etc. Stuff doing.

Florida, Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, not. I'm Melbourne. We've endured long, strict, awful lockdown get point. nations need look us example - done way get major spread controllable amount. Super lockdown major downsides alternative. Lol rising Trumps fault. Easy Answer, Reality Show President. None states closed vacationing. Hotels, restaurants, bars opened across country Florida. point even trying make? I’m trying say it’s wrong people vacationing pandemic. Serves right. Remote learning implemented 10 years ago already. People never take things seriously late. 

Remote learning made possible years ago thanks Iliad/Free. Fire so-called ""teachers"" adapt remote teaching. Period. Easily. No. reopened quickly lessened restrictions. ""Lmao"" 😂 one know/is related died far. virus piss poor job killing people thb. end day control actions, seeing thing happen world unless it’s island nation ruled dictator type governments part.

So saying dictatorships governments protect citizens? Constitution death pact opinion? else get rid name freedom? Child labor laws? 40 hour week? Food drug contamination laws? Pollution laws, CDC, United Nations? Every man himself? Sounds like chaos rich rule all. Well you’re busy tweeting instead something useful..  Probably need money live Effective public campaigns (in US anyway) supposed aimed someone 5th grade education level.

Let sink minute. would make good Dalek. dumbasses protest berlin tho. idiots every country. someone working front lines thing...

...you explained perfectly. Huh. Seems like one thing want do. even work? people sex outside like exhibitionists? official COVID-19 “positivity rate” odds rates reported renowned tracker run Johns Hopkins University. official state rate around 5 percent; Johns Hopkins says it’s closer 12. country barely get healthcare best prepared haha...  100 years self-righteousness. 100 years rich control lot. 100 years stupidity able vacation there?? Hmm?? that? HMMMM. able wonder.

HMMM.

Care answer? 77,000 people couldn’t muster strength vote overqualified candidate president US 2016 original report US ""the best prepared nation confront pandemic"", always flawed take.

Very much this. Following passage ACA drawdown number hospital beds due new capitation formulae. states. folks LOVE hating Trump create foundations mess. People would much compliant told leaders wear mask stay home, plus enforcement. I’m trying slam also people coming Florida vacation also. bringing virus back states. headline "" prepared "" 2 months ago everyone kept talking shit .


Almost? almost Bold move sticking casedemic narrative positivity rate increasing couple weeks hospitalizations rising place. Might want update marching orders. is. 8 months warnings China, EU, NY, CA, TX, FL...but alas, way convey information quickly enough.  Wtf mean bingo IHME

Well, shit, say so, could dismissed without give click crap media source. 🤔🤔🤔🤔 Pretty useful killing people blowing stuff, you’ve got going guess Poe's law :( R/nottheonion Bad leadership source downfall group/institution end day, people usually categorically unintelligent unfortunately there's much it. 

They may seem exhibit classic 'Hollywood movie' signs 'dumb', probably check boxes clinical 'Am dumb?' list. 

- Lack imagination (causing take things mostly literally)
- Superficial
- Net-zero thinking 
- Inability empathize
- Over-reliance others tell (goes back low imagination &amp; black white thinking). Think religious leaders, politicians, celebrities, etc. 
- Obvious Dunning-Kruger Effect action (they're usually confident think know) exactly point.. could compare Belgium densely populated American state, whole US  doesn’t include specialty hospitals, either. Like, Kansas City Orthopaedic majority owned St Lukes designated overflow facility things go extra FUBAR. I'd like think going force us focus failures need reform healthcare industry, given flaming still get point failures making medicine profit based (and insurance poor way fund all) gives massive sad.

I hope find employer treat valuable employee irreplaceable human soon, quitting current job saves someone else laid off. work hospital support role we're literally decimating workforce (well, maybe ""literally"" one killed like Rome, 10% staff laid off). Donald F__@*ing Trump. Period. most, 15 people 217 board got infected index case flight (or few) face masks. That's 7.3% plane infected.

This study face masks use.

And even without face masks, 7% odds getting sick someone plane great, terrible either. entire plane getting sick. I'd like think going force us focus failures need reform healthcare industry, given flaming still get point failures making medicine profit based (and insurance poor way fund all) gives massive sad.

I hope find employer treat valuable employee irreplaceable human soon, quitting current job saves someone else laid off. work hospital support role we're literally decimating workforce (well, maybe ""literally"" one killed like Rome, 10% staff laid off). Rhymes Ronald Pump. Real prepared wealth based healthsystem. Even fact Trump got best treatment mony buy cos money diferant monarch back day useing state funds improve standard living Slavs die fields. Peoples party political officers name  thinking long term. They're not. takes time everyone start dying. Yes. Much higher amounts could absorb orally.  wanna go UK Winter. know travel restrictions. guy replying clue he's talking about. He's clearly never worked field. Never frontliner. know anything universal health care. called ""socialist health care"". alone enough show kind person is. Rlf-100 republicans thought buying run country dummies book Outdoors is! Republicans - everybody else. undecided. ones usually vote feel matter.

They need constantly reminded happening GOP. Well, guess long enough since last pandemic people forgot avoid them. looks like relearn it. always chalk mixture both. people *are* dumb (or least dumb “what could banana cost? $10?” fashion). Others actively, maliciously gain.

Unfortunately seem managed find significant amounts both, second happy put first power since know back up. trick. He's hoping phantom distribution plan tricks people thinking vaccine ready. Cant be, heard things happen states democratic government don’t want to?  really need article this?

One word: Trump Damn.  i'm expert i'd wager everything trump administration okay killing people sake votes one generic rolls, either. taste funny. visited wisconsin wedding last weekend one even masked , asked remove mine pictures hell Florida nearly doubling 7 day average deaths California half population? They're point curve time-wise well. There's difference whether search europe (continent) eu (european union).  stockpiling medical supplies awhile one reason. Except governor NOTHING protect people. Rather, causing deaths things spiraling control.

That issue trying slam you. guys see changes area? don’t! schools open person people, albeit masked, seem going business usual. point life going change like March? taking Governor Cuomo killed 6,600 seniors sending sick young people NURSING HOMES thousands beds temporary hospitals lay empty?

Definitely psycho. profit? Dumb people plan for, anticipated going manipulated putting someone evil charge. That's Nazis got in. know seasonality. Malta, live, getting escalating numbers since August, record numbers past week. 

It's warm time. first time put long sleeves evening couple days ago. Summer Belgium often colder this.

So know seasonality, really. Dude, france. Tell face people online learning option. really know countries things play favor : France holiday destination french like holidays - thé average french considerate honest - schools reopened everyone mandatory physical attendance (Big face palm , get did'nt put half thé students zoom, half class. high school, 35 students per classroom fit one person) - shitty weather since late August (cold rainy, usual), people inside - finally, café culture? know eu country I've always viewed french thing compared countries) . They're small, cramped popular. shitty weather made outside dining quite impossible... US shit testing people motivation get tested unless they're sick enough forced see medical care. Nobody wants get quarantined 2 weeks, employers trying avoid people 2 weeks, etc. amount cases simply swept rug mild huge.

All seeing moderate worse cases. Viruses tend get less deadly get contagious. WASH HANDS OFTEN. USE HAND SANITIZER OFTEN. DON’T TOUCH FACE. isn’t complicated. got complacent probably believed government control hold responsible. likely 5-10x higher March/April. Although developing countries still high testing capacity. Well then, guess put coronavirus jail. Sue hospital funeral costs. mean, ""everything right,"" must virus that's wrong. Except close gym. Morons Nice everything right means via Zoom. GTFO. proudest fap. Won’t buying Stella tonight. 8 330 million Americans virus

8 million detected. actual number infections significantly higher -- least order magnitude.

Note locations already experienced serious outbreaks participating next wave. become apparent additional waves transpire. susceptible pool regions dwindled significantly, slowing transmission. sweeps nation, overall rate new cases drastically drop. Theres benefit comes intelligence, change mind.

A super ugly super smart person always worse life (given he/she wrong wrong family/country) ultra dumb ultra attractive person. need know concert judge wasted guy reasonable desire suck famous dick. instance I'm referring dieting dont end like him. Don’t give credence. got covid prepping Trump debate wearing mask One neice one sister. ""Hindsight 2020"" become fucking prophecy. Fortunately states kept hospitalizations low, while... point heard immunity (probably vaccine), open back quickly fill quick.

But also, understanding plenty empty beds hospitals, that's need lots empty beds case emergencies... Say there's natural disaster, beds fill - doctors nurses going work overtime couple weeks, handle excess load system, things go back normal. level sustainable years end... idea 'sustainable' load is, I'm sure varies city city, hospital hospital, still see frequent stories doctors/nurses saying overworked Covid. Really? mean, work large, 700+ bed one capacity opened field hospital state fair grounds, please tell fantasy land. hospitals overwhelmed, many, many different parts US, are, next weeks/ months. religious right idea stem cells work. Try talking actual science total loss. impossible bridge gap topics like one side cannot educate themselves.  burp mask makes eyes water maintaining strict 6 foot distance rest us. 

Hypocrite. Lol like 6’6” atleast Bullshit. He's avoiding WH months enabling Trump's denialism. could spent time passing laws democrats requiring admin put mandatory safety guidelines, investing testing capabilities, etc.

Instead, kept safe watching Trump let Americans die.  worries try look updates, coz subs seems political one scientific regular people like us Even COVID...

I ride bike myself... done? Never give man. good leadership global cooperation, overcome.
Look China. thriving What? *can* learn. Here's hoping sticks.  CDC website: “Early evidence suggests natural immunity COVID-19 may last long.”

Hint: ‘Natural Immunity’ occurs become immune specific disease contracting it. believe Madrid ever really reached seroprev level NY first wave. Chris Christie survived think I'll good. he's going heaven.... know don’t go hand hand. Good ol families values like mistress get abortion. It’s weird focus shifted waiting vaccine pandemics history never vaccines people dream vaccines. Wrong.

It's knowledge. Understanding things work.

Build technology - forget works.. perhaps someone knows make factory produce smartphones example - make smartphone give someone else without knowledge works, internals mystery, obviously probably know works..

Ie know language, someone else understand. Cannot claim they're 'inferior brains' -- obviously simply never learned it.

Can big brain, STILL understand language unless actually figure out. Gibberish figure out. didnt claim silver bullet, saying effective misleading. Many doctors (even openly Reddit) dismissing symptoms anxiety overexposure news/media virus.  That's wonderful thing masks guidelines, keeps infected population manageable level. Remdesivir would 'common' treatment let 50million Americans simultaneously infected, simply enough doses. happen absolutely incorrect.

- Masks mandatory closed public spaces soon lockdown lifted.

- Schools closed summer &amp; reopened Sept 1 only. daycare July &amp; August..

- isolated cases much controlled : testing + contact-tracing + strict quarantine protocol, salaries quarantined workers got paid govt. 
The govt also launched contact-tracing app privacy concerns &amp; lack trust total failure, entirely them.

Some people like make facts, reason. Even though don’t even need to, considering numbers speak themselves. would nice grew spine actually stood party properly, still, better expected  still yea, i'm sure everyone. beauty using absolute riling ignorant asshole. Republicans: ""When happens me, that's care.""

From gay rights, like son come gay

To fucking virus. ""It's hoax. Masks oppression"". ran continues run ""family values"" Wise decision. good reason Canada take unwillingness get better control. Damn, created toxic replies, lol Wow basically he's endorsing Biden, right? It’s like blowing hole space suit. 

Generally it’s said takes 15 minutes sustained close contact...so it’s like one particle getting immediantly infect you. wearing mask crowded area thirsty, take off, take drink, put back on. 

Likewise, restaraunt...you probably susceptible since won’t wearing mask aren’t talking particles here.  took almost die take serious, bad 210K people matter.  Every Church event this. Madrid Lombardy, smaller NY area population. Could bit herd immunity affect work NYC? Sure. reason second wave? Obviously not. *The Hills Alive Sound Spittle* case requires going ICU probably serious enough warrant browser history erase book title thumbnail sums experience perfectly. use both, québécois/e preferred french. although people might use quebecer refer person native quebec, used largely interchangeably. least case montreal. outside montreal, french used heavily québécois likely preferred.  Part reason may person know changes mind something praise trash wrong opinion before.

If welcom change opinion makes easier future, instead shaming wrong.

South park episode explains quite nicely :-) think that's conservative mindset. Like bad way idea tradition certain way strong people. Change must thrust upon willing deal it. always bad thing ends looking hypocritical change minds. trial part placebo branch - Wonder treatments received ... Better Uighur China Uighur one countries US bombing. extended family alive government literally find job get tempted hang religious tired supposedly woke people using gay put Near death experiences (including 7 days reflection laying bed trying die) tend change person.

I'm glad hes okay. I'm glad bad trip coming back positive message. Respect. That’s fucked up, would absolutely leave hospital jaded fuck right now. can’t believe isn’t pissed thanks abstinence-only sex ed. mean think parties full shit bags. I’m sorry think people waste life blindly following morons plain dumb.  Well.... live abstinence state, generally aren't. ever met someone thought kissing makes pregnant? have. pull 100%? have. hearing trump chants decades Fingers crossed others learn prominent republics getting sick. truly hope put humanity party line. Yooo dude former governor world broken thousands years, carry on? mean, half changed tune. saying directly Trump wrong, response crisis transcends tax/regulatory policy vote leaders trying stop people dying. Republicans also make difficult know (no sex ed) access (restrictive laws, expensive healthcare). main effective thing Trump got steroids. None stuff prevented developing serious lung involvement. Steroids proven treat that, proven reduction mortality drug. Parts west Texas Texas panhandle starting run low IC U beds again... El Paso area, Lubbock/Amarillo area. Remdesivir shown reduce time hospital, important allowing hospitals keep beds available. one additional tool toolbox, silver bullet. r/LeopordsAteMyFace nutshell didn’t know car accidents transmissible   Woah, that's excellent idea. manufacturer REGN-COV2 stated employs stem cells research, commonly mouse embryonic stem cells human blood stem cells. ""antibody cocktail"" given Trump combination two human-made proteins developed using decades-old cell line derived embryonic kidney tissues obtained aborted human fetus say ""it's made aborted fetus"" sort pointless that's fetal stem cell research works. never issue. literally transplanting cells fetus, would organ transplant. used manufacture/research process though. Magic bullet effective wide range. Quite studies shown positive effect Trumps case also. 

The antibodies part interesting. Id read much till now. know took things along remdesivir. mean duration immunity, yes, none 3-4 months immunity. short term majority people. I'm hoping 2nd, 3rd, 4th infections milder, expecting all. Either get good vaccine done. change opinions worst-case scenario? disbelief then? got insurance I’ve hospital cause immune deficiency called CVID. It’s gonna 5 day stay big bill insurance covers it. Fuck Andy Dick. Tiger hit harder Maybe he’s obese. exactly correct. compassion required beyond length nose impossible. ""happen them"". Meh. feel like 🤡 double they’ve tested positive still don’t mention much mask wearing would done differently. bar really low personally terms people accountable point. baseball game peasants told we’re allowed attend? Bergamo huge second wave? I'll happy feel safe around 10 people time! Yes, agree. 

If look Hong Kong case asymptomatic second time, difficult find cases even know they're reinfected.

But media likes focus instead deadly reinfection old cancer patient NL. buy one. Planes gross, people grosser cant todays numbers, since like middle night, yesterdays numbers.

Todays numbers shouldnt until... tomorrow. US kills 800 Puritanism idea ""having fun bad"" inactivated vaccine candidate right? works can't world simply manufacture since technology well known? grown poor, ""college experience"" focused making sure could get good job graduating.

Wasn't last year, job offer hand, could really relax enough enjoy ""the experience"". like come conclusion reinfection extremely common deny based information truth scary. pays post? problem letting virus become political. many places politicians last say lo behold 

Also: But.. But.. military dictatorship it.. Lol  I'd say 5 million least (total) Unless suddenly let billion people, know market dwarf coming years. China India 3 billion people them. alone dwarf rest world's markets one day. even mentioned 3rd biggest economy, Japan. Indonesia also powerhouse one day. century see everyone's focus shift Asia. International companies started America turn Asian companies heavily cater them. I'd surprised point start seeing reinfections due amount time since first wave started. Even skipping fact antibodies something 100% mean immune (different people various effectiveness fighting viruses antibodies), around 8 months since cases started getting recognized North America. Surely even people strong antibody response going start becoming vulnerable. lasting immunity infections, lasting immunity vaccine.

All pray vaccine induced immunity lasts long enough make booster shots viable. Somehow ppl survived millennia without gyms vanity.  give rich money, they'll provide minimum wage jobs. Thank god even need it. hard lock virus already spreading control. needed literally wear masks quarantine anyone coming overseas 14 days. half Taiwan did, we'd completely fine aside international tourism. Taiwan never shut anything down, restaurants still packed, nightclubs crowded, gyms open, etc. know tourism industry I'm guessing lot tourism made domestic tourism people can't travel abroad easily anymore. GDP set grow 1.5%.

Even none contact tracing, quarantine, etc, would likely fine wore masks. whole situation stupid quagmire business in. Tuberculosis still kills million annually. never speak Nah, like 25 told stock market meant jobs certain orange somebody. *Restrictions todays numbers, BNO tweet ""reported"" yesterdays numbers better aed handy opens first medical bill. Coronavirus ~~pandemic~~ response plunges millions Americans poverty Seriously? asserted without evidence, dismissed without evidence.

Perhaps be, yet fool would automatically 10,095 medical &amp; public health scientists 27,342 medical practitioners - that's nearly 40,000 experts - making assertion.

But get bonus points referencing Hitch. Tories attempt look like something without actually anything productive. nature lying cheating lazy shysters interested diverting public funds friends pockets. spending 12billion track trace system made amateur Microsoft Excel paying competent programmers reasonable price decent product conservative enough, much better pay friend's kid exorbitant amount defective product.

That's ""conservatives"" operate. isn’t Trump, it’s entire GOP propaganda conglomerate online cable. point closed question reopening moot point. Spain, Italy, France, UK Germany numbers 500 daily whole summer long. travellers returned spikes August levelled out. Schools also started August Germany problem, hardly cases. meat factories large outbreaks didn´t spread cities (Tönnies Gütersloh). completely different setting, increase without direct cause, can´t blame specific parties events Germany anymore, diffuse spreading everywhere. didn´t type spreading April September. R0 around 1.1 1.4 Germany. know that. blind squirrel finds nut every (referring OP NY, thoughtful well written here) Stonks get result 24 hours Germany, cannot get termin test always directly. Think way: 2022 university social life going lit guy made decisions currently 70% approval rating that's Murdoch press Monopoly country demonizing like he's Antichrist. 

This something need understand past US nation others would look leadership times moral compass despite nations many flaws. this.....the way handled..... longer look US way even Petty nation huge people still vote like best idea ever heard. symptom post COVID memory loss, it’s almost certainly related actual illness lingering system severe lifelong damage. Especially self reported survey. 

Yes girl experiencing. Yes happens. doesn’t mean you’re going brain damage COVID. 

Also, I’m going reread it, doesn’t study break symptoms? leading symptom could well something mild like brain fog gets wrapped study says worst things happening everyone. people “need” gym can’t one thanksgiving home. culture can’t handle slightest inconvenience. think anecdote one seen lot places! university husband teaches, majority faculties online-only instruction, spite fact longer restricted in-person instruction. i've heard that's case many universities country. anecdotally, tons things implemented unknown outside sweden careful restrictive recommended us. correct, Europe cold wet. went well late September came many dumb people voting interest rich people realize much easier throw millions media company social media change public opinion. Oh commissars U.S governments
 agencies. U.S leaning right make full circle Communism. 

Greeting new comrades, Vietnam love. Yes, Canada sparsely populated country Crap :-( Countries always lie testing carry mass testing, sure; basically impossible hide mass deaths. China hide 10,000 dead; India sure shit can't hide thousands deaths either. Yet still worse deaths US - total per 100K population. death rate would also skyrocket. Suddenly intensive care beds, ventilators, medical staff perform basic assistance, etc 99% severely ill population due capacity. Yeah, definitely highest total positive count yesterday anything. Oh shieett. like encephalitis lethargica millions damaged people highly doubt that. Either preexisting condition died genetics. *few* outliers this, few. They’re nearly enough justify locking everyone down.

Also old they? Actually been. republicans coopted  best argument definition, manslaughter. that's assume negligent. court would ever find negligent actions. governors. took actions. opinions, probably enough. opinions, much is. 

Just like something mean negligent. Probably sucks. Yes understand that. gets bit murky everyone also says Swedes listen instructions follow faithfully. Even Tegnell kind bragged that. doesn’t give advice everyone needs wear mask social distance. remember Tegnell fairly admit beginning scientific evidence masks helped all. decent evidence. Tegnell would admit wrong seems pretty reluctant do. instead he’s saying kind wishy washy thing maybe masks could useful circumstances people might social distance much blah blah. Seems pretty weak especially guy strong opinions almost everything. suspicious. number new cases found last days average. per capita total number new cases.

 might per capita better Denmark worse Norway, Finland terms new cases per capita right now. best worse countries around us time best case scenario. 12th per capta deaths world 60% Australia's population live four cities (Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth). next four take another 10%.

You're stating equivalent ""Canada sparsely populated country"". trolling doom-spouting anyone favors. Please knock off. We're something similar. think there's way *small* family gathering safely there's lot necessary precautions, like stated, many people follow them. think Fauci tried state something effect people would interpret blanket approval family gatherings. totally get coming from, smart manage risk appropriately. muhh military Well course do. use commas instead decimals moral views alien own. turned 20 2 weeks ago, got diagnosed covid 5 weeks ago today. solid week half around 2 weeks ago nauseous hell, dizzy fatigued again. fatigue still lingering sucks, one understands either. We’re wealthiest country world. best scientific institutions medical pharmaceutical researchers. importantly 2 months lead time. 

&amp;#x200B;

\- want emphasize think worried news. isolated case case indicates get mild illness re-onset covid-19, says Johan Ringlander.

Hmm deaths reinfections severe cases? Sure Ah yes thats looking for. damn calcidiol study. Ty linking that, knew something specific vitamin D. yeah you’re right can’t rush science lol. Researchers must like god like patience. Trial error, setting complex randomized controlled studies, waiting scrutinization others. done though objective truth emerge. even serious question lol sounding alarm. See many people expressing sentiments around corner getting back normal. I'd prefer people prepare rather get rude awakening unexpectedly, way many people got news COVID despite many sub sounding alarm early. See Nythro said. Wow need curse - Yes - names please - don’t believe story - simple obituary - Yo stop coming sub troll people, realize one believes you, you? misinterpreting science, friend. ""immunity lasts 3-4 months"" say sure, mean ""only"" means ""minimum"". minimum would 10s thousands reinfection cases now. not.  lancet fine, scientific paper, editorial.

The major journals printing complete nonsense pandemic. bit problem. lot really dodgy science slipping cracks, lot ideologues getting soap boxes hold court. really follow model something many known unknown unknowns novel virus society's collective regional responses it. 

It gives ballpark estimate one take forecasts gospel...

Even weather models wildly wrong within 24 hour, even 12 hour period time... instance, last November state forecast get flakes falling sticking changing rain global weather models, last minute shifts track intensity noticed shorter range models like NAM discounted 

A. thought early year major even moderate snowfall region

B. None longer range models bought idea event already ongoing.

The end result local meteorologists including day event dismissed chance snowing dusting anywhere area, noon starting slowly backtrack albeit late, evening rush hour hundreds thousands people caught guard stranded completely untreated roads 4-12 inches snow well coating ice fell across region. 

&amp;#x200B;

I digress... Weather models lot variables accounted for, types sudden shifts track, temperatures, intensities common, occur yearly. transmission, mortality rate, public reaction pandemic composed thousands variables accurately plugged supercomputer results gospel.

Hence putting near full faith consistency type model surprised shifting results inaccuracies forecasts silly.. still good thing (unlawful detention), That's great y'all sense civic duty, poltical exist America, even close. Since post deals United States, that's I'm talking about.

Also, FYI, y'all done virus work hospital. wear masks 100% time. add face shield certain, higher risk areas.  Guess I’ll let crawl nose onto chin name safety. Good plan Fauci even employed point? seems like job refute stupid shit comes White House every day, behind scenes. thought lancet somewhat reputable website scientific discussion? 

I mean, I’m glad hear you’re disagreement premise article... don’t biology/epidemiology background disagree experts. someone want dox they're lying? Lol know 3 people died Covid locally, 2 ICU. 1 pre-existing condition. rest healthy This^^ Canadian get mostly American music/media. many songs hear say ""look made do."" equally bullshit excuse take responsibility actions. actual fascist night better. ideology basically demands strong leader interest strengthening protecting population costs.

This pandemic shown us level destruction en antagonizing administration reach terms public health, regardless country's preparedness. Inconceivable failure nickname Trump earned running casino ground. title running United States ground. Covid-19 played trump card! offense think work comprehension skills. numbers different US cities however. Oklahoma dakotas right That's name school, town Winnetka. even pretentious actually. per capita? case we’re better, lot. 

Not “better” particularly useful constructive think doctors pretty good identifying covid patients So? Nobody claims Sweden's strategy worked well beginning, nobody immune. mean good strategy continue initial bad start. rapid decrease infections summer proved strategy works. Let's wait see much cases go now, Sweden deaths neighbors. well, already know answer question Really? pass June wake now? studies done, protests outdoors nearly 100% mask usage, contributed absolutely nothing community spread. 

This new policy large house parties masks distancing whatsoever, causing state's numbers revert back looked like early June/late May. seeing behavior change here, people stopped distancing, causing problems. think consider annual lockdowns fall fight flu + covid. Hitler Hitler.  Decades ""news"" (fox, facebook others.). Telling people trust scientists.  president tells thing. 

There lot misinformed people refuse abide safety precautions. r/coronavirus claims lot stupid, far-fetched things sides ledger (whether pessimist optimist). funhouse mirror distortion reality media takes study scientific paper, pens exaggerative misleading clickbait article gets posted here, host laymen descend start wildly misunderstanding it. telephone game nonsense. 

The September-November timeline Vaccines always potential EUA, ""you'll shot arm then"". Should’ve V8. whitehouse endorsed V8’s cure yet? could see trump slapping someone forehead cause V8 Fauci shares Gilead? Yes, every disease history contained cured antibiotics. Herd immunity, btw, includes immunity conferred vaccines.

Natural selection means people vulnerable disease longer reproduce hardy enough resist survive. context also mean vulnerable die off, thus rendering moot moral imperative containment.

One massive historical consequence Columbian exchange, 99% Native Americans died (within years) upon contact Europeans contracted every Old World disease time (which Europeans evolved immune thousands years deadly plagues natural selection)

This laid great book called *Guns Germs Steel* (among many others). Getting bit digression though. 5x happens Europe happens US. even worse US likely. yes, trying faithfully accurately represent told us, say it. would cautious equate opinion ego, though. he's infallible human being, yes, worshipped like seem think is, *is* also extremely educated well-qualified individual, objectively speaking. disagree opinion understand frustrations come from, though. Well soviet thing schools reopened since August Germany without problems. Yeah, I’m agreement. 

I’ve seen much “We never allow socialize/travel ever again, even vaccine. You’ll always WFH you’re single, it’s time get ready die way” articles lately I’m immediate assuming people sub agreement them.

Yes, believe since **will** vaccine wait await layer protection taking “individual risk mitigation tactics”. point walk back restrictions allow population return non-sheltered life (if individuals choose to). guess that’s argument - open flood gates today. it? read higher rates us now. call lockdowns? article one arrested Facebook posts shutdowns worked. state went 700+ infections day less 5 matter weeks despite think vast majority Victoria citizens agree policy. used coming together crisis like due bushfires working together. also provide affected shutdowns. 

In last 2 months think I've seen total 2 people walking around without mask. seen Civic duty looking community fellow citizens misspelled rural county Spain, Italy, France, UK Germany numbers 500 daily whole summer long. travellers returned spikes August levelled out. Schools also started August Germany problem, hardly cases. meat factories large outbreaks didn´t spread cities (Tönnies Gütersloh). completely different setting, increase without direct cause, can´t blame specific parties events Germany anymore, diffuse spreading everywhere. didn´t type spreading April September. R0 around 1.1 1.4 Germany. Fuck. face already bloody goggle mask earplug hairnet hardhat combo. Oh well. agree mot 100 infected.

But among are, likely 0,5-1,0 die average.

The study mention based seroprevalance data lower quality many others metastudies.

But regardless 0,23 percent find stance immoral cruel. blame Trump people too. Trump came taking virus seriously cult would done too. Yes absolutely. cultures super imo here. Look Italy it’s spread there. warm, huggy, kissy cultures (which like!) unfortunately really give virus place thrive. Japan example end spectrum. Friendly cold way. handshakes never mind hugs. think thjs explains lot it. Coz clearly faked level. Average age 82...... maths admire pandemic response AU NZ economy sustain that?  much better chance survival since she’s female. premise ""the US world's best prepared nation confront pandemic"" false first place. Healthcare US pretty shitty majority population, americans overpay healthcare, health insurance tied employment bound disaster pandemic. This. silly think US best anything except putting people jail spending money bombs. Science ever evolving. thought process said cure polio, et. al. lying too. 

""But we've always done way."" common refrain ilk. STFU adults talk. might interested [this article Japan success following lessons learned sars-COV-2 focus ""k"" measures disease spreads evenly bursts super-spreader events. easy question answer.

American's fucking suck.

Source: I'm American. It’s nowhere near yet. Again, Stanford study debunked. bad university launched investigation authors study. misusing word ""helpless"". Well yes regarding individual states article shows US whole three distinct surges far. talk countries way -China, Russia, Australia, India. outbreaks localized well break data. proved right lol. 

just someone gave answer like mean problem. best example conservative 61 year old member fire brigade Saying let run course weak might need die. straight told ""your 61 , overweight diabetes, 52yo wife also severe asthmatic. they're talking letting weak die talking you! Specifically wife""

After became one main people getting people follow rules wife started making ton reusable face masks people including fancy one use :) Why? never 100% certainty old people die convictions

You seem determined think Wells screens applicants fraud tendencies. believe anymore prone white collar crime peers, I'm going waste anymore time trying convince otherwise. 

Have great day. 40k tests 10k positives, positive ratio 25%. France 12.6%, taly 5-6%, amount positive cases Belgium multiplied 4 get comparable situation Italy, 2 get comparison France. Everything said objective based science facts.

Your comment proves rude jerk are.

Go gym put risk. really could care less get covid. Everyone knows indoor spaces, especially gyms, high risk, even ""guidelines"" followed. 

But necessity way shape form. FACTS easily boost immune system without it, even going walk outside. anything luxury wanting go gym similar people demand go restaurants. front page sub silly think somehow US ""best prepared"". American ego-centrism.

I live NYC. OK, aside clusters Westchester, Brooklyn Queens. live (Manhattan) positivity rate still stays 1%. vaccines likely going fail, rather administration vaccines will. know vaccines produce permanent immunity, hypothetically cover say 1 month, 1 month window get everyone vaccinated kill virus, that's going happen. vaccine provides 6 months protection, that's workable time window, probably pull off. permanent immunity, like 5 years immunity, easy.

Who needs two random stats wikipedia?!?! stuff I’ve read typically contagious 5-7 days infection, 10 days first symptom. you’re ever exposed, obviously quarantine know. 

Would also recommend PCR test. highly sensitive. I’m still testing positive almost month removed COVID. Also many europeans. that's often people pretend care side effects lockdowns, yet willing necessary limit spread virus avoid lockdowns, activelly worsening situation. Umm think could president? Idk guess enough resources test literally every patient. T

GIven positivity rates anywhere 1-25% various states appears testing high confidence patients.


somewhere 4-99X meeting never Pfizer approval, general approval Covid vaccine.

They meeting figure way rapid meetings Pfizer, Moderna, Oxford apply EUA. Obviously dont want wait week start reviewing data. want start immediately. wonder people end Nigerian Prince scammer email lists. Actually, wonder, we. Slow motion survival fittest action. Look France's one, 4 times higher lockdown: thing Italy many cases large amount tests (positive ratio around 5-6%), France 12.6%, cases likely many more.

The thing look actual amount positive cases, number people ICU. I'm sure still state research month ago studies found smokers less likely catch Covid, lungs slightly damaged damage extends receptor Covid uses. 
(Not sure good tradeoff, certainly would reduce number hospitalisation) you...blaming cultural diversity spread Covid...? going come crying back her.

Ha ha. No. They'll try blame everything screech removal. Backing claims fair tbh. wasn’t /r/IAmVerySmart that’s you’re insinuating Lombardy still region highest number new cases, also regions reporting higher number cases compared first time see, thanks! Never that. isn’t hard fast rule depends amount viral load, vary person person. General guideline wait least 5 days exposure aren’t symptoms. link July think best explanation works, sources read still saying 5-7 days. 

If you’re showing symptoms, that’s different story course one get tested immediately.  things like f.e. Americas landscape/nature: beautiful country; problem people living there. Based rising cases EU, yeah, looks like covid fatigue well What's option herd immunity vaccine? We've seen New Zealand shutting killing virus work somehow came back. I'm honestly wondering options amount herd immunity vaccine (which would also herd immunity) Good know. I'm worried initially testing negative, infecting someone meantime subsequently testing positive. playbook coronavirus mentioned.

Well, yeah. SARS happened. Every virologist predicting nearly 20 years. public health ""war game"" coronavirus last year. It’s Trump fired pandemic team cdc, Ovi... Well, may attract Trumps attention.
It may not, given he's apparently survived, care others. Certain bits south spared first wave hit. worrying, healthcare system efficient north could get trouble. There's study article, opinion piece written journalist spiral 'almost inconceivable' failure?

It rhymes bonald bump  Weren’t national supplies expended H1N1? major question timeline: Trump loses, allow approval process go through, 2 month dead period? Best prepared? According who?

Well, I've following covid19 research since Jan know serious disease is. know insidious disease is, infectious is, affect heart/brain/blood/everything, feel quite pessimistic it. Hard take data research put coherent manner. 

Anyways, ivermectin/doxycycline shown good results practice. Bromhexine too. Antihistamines like famotidine seem helpful. Vitamin definitely seems working. I'm sure things enough stop virus mitigate damage causes long term. completely agree. person responded say anything sort. totally think strict measures, including lockdowns, necessary localized basis health care infrastructure could overwhelmed.

The pandemic end, either vaccine, natural herd immunity, virus mutating less deadly strain remains endemic. don’t buy remain current state years, even vaccine never comes.

Fuck yall vote Republican. enable nonsense. Human challenge studies showed coronavirus immunity lasts ~6-12 months. Many vaccines seem giving slightly higher responses disease, getting year protection people might plausible vaccinating people every year certainly doable.

Vaccines work best population level, even immunity last long everyone still protected everyone whose is. Assuming get enough people vaccinated, first hurdle.

If really naive probably political stunt.

New Zealand unique country, probably better countries world keeping outside boarders. Huge respect! I'm gonna say word, thinking 600 people came indoor yodel-along yodeling event ...

“The small village area positivity rate 50 percent, making highest contagion rate Europe case numbers doubling every day last week.” might wrong, state plans distribution. always end goal get pharmacies. Like...why be? understand states want create sites actually administer vaccine, *in addition* already existing pharmacies? use well?

This seems like much ado nothing. think knew CVS Walgreens would places could get it. making official.  Fuck Russia Today. Who? what?

This guy? way hell anything productive. think one pharma ceos working vaccine, trying downplay Trump saying would done election Someone tell person live, obviously can't own. best prepared one one unleashed it. try zinc Vitamin supplements? Demon semen?


/$ Mask Since tier 3 considered lockdown seems mostly pubs serve food close? Easy, plan created black man democrat. Where's thread responds 'Trump' over..and over..and over..and ..  Vaccine providers provide product providers. drugstores, give vaccines. Hospitals, clinics, senior centers, health departments. nursing homes contracted doctor medical groups. would groups provided vaccine would administer residents. stunt votes Trump. 60% literally less year, depending things go. asked dick months save lives. Old people ones risk. potentially increase quality life younger people KNOW LONGTERM EFFECTS VIRUS ARE. dense pretending issue.

Seriously, nobody chicken pox kid worries shingles later life, certainly regret getting chicken pox 1st place 1st bout shingles.   got serious problems think lame duck Trump would purposely stall vaccines spite lost election. universe would happen. true Fauci would still told people masks effective. gets called things anyway much lose, understand wanting make political. shame others don't. NIH research organization. CDC would organization would charge public health policy concerns. NIH funds plenty food allergy research (as FDA). 

What vaccines think Fauci patents on? can't find inventor vaccine patent databases. Yeah I'm seeing posts seemingly every hour one setting new record Thanks chiming in. 

When signing paperwork, discuss would happen adverse reaction, vaccine makes sick? assume able sue manufacturer since volunteered study. would least cover medical expenses vaccine caused harm? that?

(I realize I'm asking worst case scenario, odds happening unlikely.)

Btw, give COVID test admitting trial? Blood test? Nasal swab? Both?

Thanks answering questions. hope stay safe &amp; trial huge success! reality lot people getting tested, numbers probably much higher. one simple trick... trump I'm Long Island bit ahead guys. We've indoor seating months gyms opened think month half ago. hahahahahahahahaha Check Uk, Russia , France , Spain Netherlands. Combined roughly size US it’s looking good all. evidence China outright lying? I've talked people whose city millions locked everyone tested days cases found. Cus orange sus. Americans vote republicans ""Such measure disrupts limited amount people, mostly young, many sleep 11pm 6am. daily life vast majority people affected this.""

Have disagree this. huge amount people affected this, thinking party goers, staff bars, clubs, restaurants etc whole hospitality industry affected massively. I've heard  Obligatory: OP denialist troll trying stir shit start circlejerk.  Downvote report them. I'll give trends similar. I'll also point difference area considering wave 10's cases tens thousands cases. Death rate clearly way long time. dismissing numbers...but let's pretend something changed terms mortality.  Donald Trump President wot m8 Somehow masks became political...wearing mask somehow infringed rights. help nurses say wearing mask much protect you...lots dumbs using megaphones shout dumb opinions. See, think calling dumb gives WAYYYY much leeway. people running current administration idiots, pretty much college educated prestigious schools. blunder idiocy, calculated plan ensure ""right"" people come pandemic least possible losses, even monumental gains, stock portfolios.  pesky trials find annoying take time conduct. Word. Wrinkles, frown lines, baggy eyes, lost half inch hairline, muscle tone gone

I fucked around mustache minute looked like Martin Freeman’s Watson one season, 1000yrd Stare all.

I’m 20s. Agreed. need trials. don’t know people advocate say deliberately infecting someone potentially deadly disease currently effective treatment unethical. kek state serious spike. one time almost one quarter now. worse every day. 

There mask mandate. Fewer people wearing masks. bars restaurants open indoor dining guests.

People taking seriously even months later disease still beating hell us. said. Fuck. China. topic China, CCP lemming. “people” get hot anything China. China bad! China dangerous world. topic review thread includes nothing else China. China caused yet another catastrophic problem. China big global enemy. China caused current pandemic. Reddit general loves shit US. made similar comments EU hammered got voted like crazy. Overall I’ve noticed seems Redditors hate Americans. don’t know why; seems like posts crapping US management virus. 1 word/name:TRUMP  Certain smart people convinced dumb people listen smart people. thinking that, many dumb people internet never know Wooooosh dunno undiong pandemic response team Obama put place probably big problem. . . Sorry, what's problem here? region case numbers high even supposed visit family?

It's mix. Actually, we're great shape. I'm Denver, rules tightened. running 22 per 100,000 new cases day (7 day rolling average) positivity rate 4.7%. 

Part fear spreading 'Rona, part trying get take seriously, part resentment people behaving foolishly we're gonna get jail time soon. It’ll interesting holds end winter. Question- love grandparents (or parents they’re older)? so, don’t model kinds behaviors want see people they’re around grandparents/parents keep safe? almost like want weaken America cause chaos. I'm sure foreign governments super happy that. According posts want New Zealand lockdown even harder, i'm assuming trolling point sir... shouldn’t announce “might” release anything specific date. That’s giving false hope bunch people think it’s magic cure-all reopening. [Dr. Fauci makes clear day still take precautions even For, like, what? fourth fifth It’s going way polio measles, get vaccine, case closed, it’s done. It’s going public-health measures linger months months.

Look, everybody. Even vaccine Spring/Summer 2021, Dr. Fauci says need wear masks distance. might want that, **but realistically, can't see states like NY, NJ, MA, IL, MI, CA allowing everything go immediately back normal vaccine**. Everyone plan costs republicans money.... don’t agree title. title should’ve been: ‘The US THOUGHT world’s best prepared nation pandemic’.

In reality US never prepared. MERS vaccine Oxford Covid vaccine based almost many antibodies year month injection. said look beyond year time. nothing else that's promising. understand first guy joking want compare Sweden first-class healthcare system one highest rates single-occupant households world developing nation limited resources.

That makes sound remarkably foolish.

Sweden located place called Scandinavia, periphery core Europe (i.e. location time prepare response).  rest Scandinavia fraction fatality rate.  Connect dots.  top 30% quarantining unhealthy adding everyone interacts 30%. think I'm going limb assume that's almost everyone. turning Catch 22.

And going somehow reducing restrictions. people need learn hard way. Gavin Newsom said May would 26 million Californians coronavirus. today entire country 7.3 million. failure? Probably can't link ABC article, but:

""The data shows 3,200 flights flew China U.S., including 1,000 flights went Los Angeles nearly 500 landed San Francisco New York – three among eventual hot spots COVID-19 outbreak U.S. 100 flights China arrived six American cities: Chicago, Seattle, Detroit, Dallas, Washington, D.C., Newark, N.J.

According travel data previously obtained ABC News, flights translated 761,000 Chinese nationals entering U.S. Americans returning home People’s Republic China critical four-month period.""

Considering amount people exposed quickly flights. US handled well. Four ten busiest airports world US. way US could reduced spread even shut international flights January.

It's interesting one brought make international flying safer. want politicize election. Poor leadership moved US Canada. Feels great. Although Canada losing control Corona well, least u don’t get broke life u get sick. Trump, Trump Ah, Trump's base  hear dude Dirty Rotten Ulcer Malignantly Pandering Filth. science changes, it’s based evidence, feelings. Trump’s emotional anti-mask tantrums continued weeks/months science proved masks effective. It’s amazing people blame Fauci giving Trump pass.

Trump *still* holding rallies events encourage people wear masks, even infected one high profile anti-mask supporters dead.

The mental gymnastics embarrassing. can't China democratic country. LMAO. Work Feds looting tax dollars?

Hook Kushner theft LOL

As if. states been, fucking this.

Republicans evil hilarious (as outsider, must suck live there)  Terrible Response Ultimately Murdering People. think Trump personally approves drug, FDA congress step handle it. Hold onto butts. Daily Covid death count US currently lowest point since beginning July.

It trending downwards since beginning August continues so. We're also currently position folk obeying lock rules, might end lower rates now.

Unless reading something specifically says method work (?), need test saying whether effective That’s true. actually took funding national mask stockpile. 

The US hasn’t administration prepared pandemic. 

This bi-party failure. didn’t mention politics post. comparing US advanced nations. Comparing us average rest advanced world, adjusted population differences, shows US 150,000 excess deaths 8 million unemployed. We’ve lost 1/3 GDP. evidence needed?

If think Covid overstated: whatever, you. stay away loved ones please. also suggest visit hospital talk ICU doc nurse.

Have nice day. It'll normalized caught something, we're Kakashis. Another article claimed 8 million. math. 8 million, that's 2.64% USA population. Every single number gave way outside what's considered remotely accurate. Stop spreading misinformation. Labor day religious holidays certain communities resistant following guidelines least NJ NY...

Just wait Thanksgiving December Holidays half US cry attack traditions, Christmas, Jesus, haircuts company outings Fauci CDC recommend meeting family stuff year, significant portion rest think they're families somehow safer others meet things anyway, rest us shake heads comfort facepalms we've since April...   What? country who's leaders listened scientists enforced rules stop spread successfully stopped virus? could've ever guessed! sure scientists spent lives working subject know me. lot ... LOT .. stupid people here. even charge... ""things"" actually 200 million rubles, comrade. Per hour hospitals COVID patient. 

You read CAPS get full effect. 3 works. two would not, least US. work fine South Korea China civil liberties constrained Also, Reddit communication twist this. 

When ask question like Swedes don’t wear masks, tell why. official objective reason why. “FHM point time recommend bla bla bla...”

That mean person replying question necessarily agrees recommendation FHM (like myself) right objective explanation heated argument attacks person responding often starts. people (like myself) become defensive. 

Just bear mind asking question getting answers. Peace. Wtf low? destroy economy this? Contact tracing informing people contact infected person? That's pure democracy work. People fucking stupid. theory, that's elected officials. One word: Trump. Touted President. Hydroxycloroquine part II. 7% lethality rate

It not. Current estimates 0.2-0.6% range. Pay attention what's going on. New ATH +399,602 worldwide new COVID-19 cases yesterday. Masks quite effective preventing transmission infected. airline stewards masking shouldn’t much risk. par Germany per capita - people concerned extreme surge.

Also, ditch shady testing policies, like testing old dead people? really good article, confirms news sources Asia last number months showing. Let scientists lead mid-February, disease also spreading throughout Japan, epidemiological data leading Oshitani’s team two surprising first people symptoms could pass disease. second related phenomenon known “superspreader influenza, sick people might pass disease two three others, people infected coronavirus — almost 80 percent — weren’t passing virus anyone all. Instead, small minority people infecting many others time, often crowded, poorly ventilated places came close contact engaged conclusions accepted many scientists around world, took months Japanese findings gain broad backing. Meanwhile, home, formed basis country’s approach tackling use critical containing virus spreading air, scientists concentrated spotting eliminating clusters transmission cannot sustained without forming clusters,” Oshitani simple conclusion shaped Japan’s unique alternative harsh lockdowns: notion spread virus controlled people simply avoid riskiest settings, known “san mitsu,” 3C’s — closed locations poor ventilation, crowded places, close-contact settings conversations taking place. get thread locked? Please AZ holding 2.1%

That's CFR. thing. thats stupid. work younger crowds commonly service workers pass others. Many work nursing homes care facilities.

Here's real game plan:

Slow transmission down, keep lower, keep much transmission low initial dose hopefully keep higher percentage sick asymptomatic mild cases.

You mask mandates shuttering worst offenders far spreading. 
This keeps R0 lower burns population slower, healthcare industry continue function still help regular patients well continue normal tests followups people normally need. Breast cancer screenings, colonoscopies, cardiologist followups, etc.

By slowing spread bending curve, ALSO give us time develop improve treatments get serious cases.

Hopefully vaccine two three turns work well, vaccinate large chunks population slow spread.

We need lockdown close stores, nightclubs gyms church chorus likely thing right now.


Letting burn unfettered population march, april may would absolute disaster. Letting would also disaster. No, don’t believe anyone said much hate agree think may right. large percentage people refusing get vaccinated lack approved treatments help get infected see covid19 going away time soon. car repair business day. walked door another customer coming wearing mask. noticed sign door saying mask required. went sure enough none employees wearing mask. waited another guy came pay bill, mask. first time months seen business allowed workers customers wear mask.

So expect winter coming republicans stopping governor massive increase covid infection deaths. already ramping up. Winter holidays coming covid hell Michigan started GOP dominated SC ruling. depends... march tested people every symptoms flu one else would missed non-symptomatics people covid positive... 
If test anyone contact, catch asymptomatics thus positive results. 

The tests make, percentage positive (people / amount test done ) lower. would 50% positive ou 3000 tests march 10% positive ou 40 000 tests october. absolute number higher however percentage positive/test lower. Testing alone doesn’t keep Covid facilities..... This

Exceptions include Pacific Islands Asian police states Maybe large obese unhealthy population?  death rates dropped pretty much everywhere, even new cases increased. I'm sure exactly attribute to.  combination testing, better prepared hospitals, etc? possible COVID less deadly now, like strains evolved become contagious less deadly.

 Remember Imperial College London model April projected 2.2 million U.S. deaths, believe assuming pandemic ended November. Yeah strict one

We can't even begin fix problem, people believe even problem. 


Media social media need reigned in, polarization measured blood. Obama launched unprecedented amount drone strikes Middle East, shut Occupy Wall Street movement, sent military deal protests pipeline native land ultimately leak oil ground. ACA made life way worse people, now, addition insurance, fined insurance. much Obama's presidency democratic control House Senate, lot space left promised campaign. 

Both parties represent interests imperial neoliberal capitalists actively work interests working class. Democrats shown time open change. blame solely Republicans willfully ignore failings system got us here. One word: Trump.

There literal video brags killing Pandemic Preparedness Plan Obama pit place. Citing businessman like wasting money. needed would rehire researchers back. works. president right now. conglomerate grifters collection scams, including monetizing pandemic. interest slowing down.

It spiraled people top trying fail. news now? known issue Witkofsky &amp; Moeller appointed. [House already launched investigation last month political appointments CDC. Whose say anyone immune all? 

I suppose look hospital workers reinfection, establish baseline? using proper masks caution average person.

We also know asymptomatic cases exist. maybe people catching 'first time' knowing first time, could 2nd 3rd time.

Im starting think going away. Ever. 

It's new standard flu, around ever. Probably lowering life expectancy average something we've artificially inflating decades. one March many months.  National divide one. biggest issue Republicans reason still adamant whole thing hoax. refuse believe scientific evidence behind everything, huge part reason everything still way is. country 2/3rds following proper CDC protocol, even matter 1/3rd follow whatsoever.

You thinking Diamond Princess study (which also ""debunked"" extrapolated plainly discrete publicly available data set)

This study funded John Arnold (apparently--I looked up), happen know personally that's huge coincidence

In case, CDC says ~0.5%, consider lower bound like Holy shit reporting irresponsible ignorant fuck... know, I'm relieved! colors really confusing me. ought much better, actually bet cases disappear like miracle pretty soon.  is, I’m going rely billion dollar companies big “maybe”. knew they’d know sure. good little censor thing happen let run rampant? 

The binary nature debate tedious. 

I deny danger damned plague. 

I'm terrified folks continue press understand nature threat. 

But us frankly little worry about. 

I live alone, worked home years, 50 BMI 25. 

And I'm running fight family invite time, ""as long wash hands"" SMH

Letting thing blaze folks like insanity.  remember right, one death reinfection woman undergoing pretty serious chemotherapy too, likely meant immune system functioning anywhere near meant to. Obviously death remains tragedy, hopeful sign average immune system shake even happens. surprising there's ""only one guy"" ""anonymous"".     
Look comment. People criticize strategy Sweden litterally casted out, mocked, called weak sometimes [fired   
You must proud. /s German's generally trust government 

You're definitely German. UK Canada Germany perhaps similar country USA world. People act surprised? knew back early February pandemic would shit show U.S. 

Most Americans lived kind pandemic serious hardships. way many stubborn egotistical people, plus Americans can't stop usual time money hustle engraved deeply American culture. top that, American diet horrible average American fat unhealthy. I'm surprised turned badly all. US unfortunate wrong president wrong time. higher up. That's exactly people are. may read couple months ago. lockdown masking followed everything reopening created artificial waves people confusing seasonal waves. think huge % NYC got infected disproportionate share nursing home population. NYC's population older rest world I'm Quebec exactly what's happening too. People way obsessed blaming federal government, cases even blaming US federal government.

Don't know works States, health policy principally provincial jurisdiction. Please stop repeating nonsense Sweden try stop virus. tried, successful. Mitigation backup strategy, like NZ everywhere else. 

The world ever eradicated single disease vaccination: smallpox. Judging hear medical professionals unlikely first batch vaccines effective perhaps even given all, instance developing countries. means virus probably around foreseeable future. Perhaps decades. reality suppression lockdowns border closures prove futile. viable strategy would get rid flu. For-profit healthcare poverty always going factors disaster here. Cant get Chinese Korean nurse every municipality tell us ignorant Westerners behave pandemic?

I think would worth cost. cases per capita low right though. Eu average US 150 % higher. Doesnt mean cant change though, cases increasing. arent able supress might end similar numbers rest Europe. Collin Co here.. voted yesterday. swear saw sign said due local ordinance masks must worn.

 Everybody mask. Poll workers masks glass shields. pen sterilized every use. People given clean q-tip use touch screen voting machines.

 well done think.  Huh? link republicans blocking Obama’s funding pandemics? listened scientists. 

This popular line reddit really mean? Scientists constantly disagree people ignore ones views like.

We could establish something like 70% x credentials recomend y.

But credentials matter case? would collect data way politically manipulated? Lol. It’s fucked up. I’m going wish bad her, nothing short catching losing someone show something people what’s stake. Well said aiming herd immunity vaccines. whole thing like documentary stupid monarchy. Trump. company. phone number database Indian scam centers pay for. number automatically dialed VoiP program. hundreds upon hundreds scam operations. number used scams too, like ""debt elimination"", ""free cruise"", ""virus protection"", refund scams, etc. currently circulating seasonal influenza viruses genetic lineage back 1918 pandemic strain (even H3N2 genes 1918 strain it).  [The 1889 Russian flu epidemic may emergence HCoV-OC43 common evolved seasonal flu cold viruses.

SARS-CoV-2 around forever less, like those, disease lose severity time due adaptability human immune system evolution reduces severity. become common cold. lower life expectancy outside immediate pandemic years.

What selling pessimistic garbage, helping. Absolute disaster comment. still want herd immunity want ""flatten curve"". contradiction. extremely confused.

Yeah sure ""conspiracy"". doctors fell Russian windows accident too. believe anything Sweden says corona, denial changing all. Learn statistics works would done differently? Education country disaster. flu vaccines, dosent kill 200,000 + people. dosent swamp hospitals.


And care, rest us do.  Yes! People want scream “it’s flu” that’s true it’s not, child, flu actually deadly absolutely none that. It’s people believe get zero risk state society politicized Democrat would contained Republican can’t... it’s dang virus! It’s weird, feel like Depending reading site alternate universe. state Governor live briefings times week Facebook, half comments things like blood children hands, schools shut down! Mind single child death state due corona. half killed economy dictator open everything now! shows politicized polarizing is, two groups think reality completely opposite neither grasp actually is. media along lack critical thinking created mess. you're

Your. Cases March/April likely much higher, testing improved lot. Sounds like HOA. Last heard even submitted approval request Ethical review, let alone approved. Yeah, that's works. Number cases divided population. even EU total cases, per capita. Spanish Flu end herd immunity. ended attenuation. virus basically became weaker faded away.  1% infected. Fox news, entertainment. charter support back GOP politicans. 

They done that, get trump impeached impeached. jobs protect gop. also successfully argued court sane person get news fox. 

The US failed every count holding fox accountable accurate reporting, fox spreading trumps lies misinformation covid horrifying scale. 

It important factor in, viewers watch fox entertainment (in name ;) ) statistically higher believe trump's lies take basic healthcare precautions acknowledge covid real enormous, preventable virus. I'm happy people die, sure seems many Swedes totally careless it. Because: odel-odel-eh-he-who  ain't even close top either. Buckle sensible wisco friends. prepared, country one half political class hell-bent dismantling government 40 years media apparatus that's convinced 1/3 country care anything Jesus. worst fear start pandemic second wave already hard hit region. population slightly state. big news 18 new cases. Let us know call returned see happening. Oh look, r / lockdown skeptics back Republicans.

That's literally it. share country bunch disease spreading science denying primitive vermin. Saw headline came see predictable ""euphoric"" comment top. disappoint. Social care others communism/socialism dont want nun round here

Apparently.  studies showing significant spread airplanes.

What? dozens case studies known incidents. I'm busy laughing crying.

I can't take seriously. Yet keep coming back. Pos rate US 20% April, 8% July 5% 

so rate overall dropping great math ! Comparing 3 months ago really quite depressing one cares. AIER mouthpiece Koch family Kato Institute. think care all, know else history, actually conversation all.

That depends. immediately go source via ad hominem attacks vs debating content question *you* want conversation. Florida open state much larger population compared MI. Even said lockdowns worth ROI. posing links blog quality sites like “the independent”.

You really need careful you’re pushing fake news. Keep crying impossible protect large risk groups literally millions infected time months. think it. Letting thing blaze folks like insanity.

You'll likely fine, that's true. nearly enough beds available, might croak relatively mild pneumonia. Daily hospitalizations would easily reach six digit numbers. Think countrywide situation like NYC Bergamo even much worse peak going take much much longer. 

And even work. Isolating risk groups, allowing infections healthy people overburdening hospitals etc....
It would take long, probably least 6 monhts would end part herd immunity. recover able dance Village People horny want kiss everyone. guess means American media. bit confused, signed there, statements scientists signed declaration false?

Translation: ""Why question substance politically motivated diatribe funded politically motivated donors agree politics?""   Incompetent leadership. Thank you. miss biggest news year? There's vaccine?? they’re ones spreading it! Steroids. Huh sounds like Boris complete 180 like earlier pandemic. one proactively pushing closures. Trump now. students today might realise degrees worthless different criteria hiring they’re position. Deaths expected go soon. usually follow hospitalizations 2-3 weeks increasing roughly period time, 29k 37k (+28 %), mainly Midwest South. Looks like US going right third Calm let scientists find real deciding something could kill 3 million Americans. that's true, still relatively small part population compared total lockdown though. Also clubs already closed Berlin. One word: republicans mean science tell long term repercussions unknown?  can’t tell many laws I’ve broken didn’t trust government’s take it. can't take seriously.

Just anyone curious every Thursday looked like. going slightly It’s also exposed badly colleges inflating value. Little less sympathy ones. fair points, wonder figures may died home Covid rather hospital. know hospital free point entry go, possibly likely die death likely outcome case.

Context king here. percentage death rates hospital cover whole picture.

The reasons POV come years conversations Americans sprained leg find actually broken going hospital pain unbearable due cost, idea baffling me. folks dosing insulin due cost, gambling thier lifes. Crowdsourcing money serious ops etc etc.

I go doctors mild pain mild symptoms, mean I'm sickly? No. taught prevention better cure, cures expensive socialized care want healthy people fix problem bad. 
The mindset I've picked Americans 'I'll see doctor I'm dead'. 

Also, I'd like add, elderly likely die start pandemic rest world better life expectancy US, would suggest elderly, thus deaths. countries elderly 'free point entry' healthcare likely go hospital immediately unfortunately die there, since point one knew fight this. Take Italy, lot elderly citizens, UK. 

So, yeah. figures needed healthcare discourages self admission due cost, creates barrier entry, best positioned deal healthcare crisis. 

If dent car accident, tell insurance want pay excess higher premiums next year, mentality goes healthcare insurance. Change Europeans humans got First foremost, digging data methodology used conclusion, accurate STILL 2 4 times estimated death rate symptomatic flu cases. 

Secondly, seems unhealthy obsession death rate determining whether drastic measures need taken stop ongoing spread virus. can't emphasize enough death rate ONE component this. 

In study COVID19 Patients ""cardiac involvement 78 patients (78%) ongoing myocardial inflammation 60 patients (60%), independent preexisting conditions, severity overall course acute illness, time original diagnosis."" concluded noting high levels troponin(heart attack hormone) MRI.

[Study Heart addition heart, ongoing research lasting effects lungs, including permanent lung damage risk restrictive lung failure, Brain Nervous system ongoing olfactory nerve damage (sense smell), brain matter lesions, etc, well musculoskeletal issues pain joint issues. 

[Long COVID say facts fear monger, issues indeed scary issues accompany virus many gotten ill, seem affect people indiscriminately, whether asymptomatic, mild, severe illness. whole need stop concerned whether die health epidemic caused virus may getting started.

Edit:Changed estimated covid vs flu mortality rate correction post u/picturethis4711 - Original post stated 20 times flu death rate incorrect. Also stated Cause Flu related mortality rate 10 per 100,000, correct. 100,000 deaths, 10 related flu. mortality rate infected flu patients varies year year .05% .1% title sarcastic? even remotely true Especially given seeming connection viral load severity infection. everyone decided ""we're done this"", masks social distancing would plummet infections we'd see could feasibly extreme. work? US 328.2 million people EU 446 million given states handle distribution, what's point saying go CVS instead Rite Aid? Exclusive deal implies may actually axing providers capable same, slowing process. 

States literally told spend weeks coming plans told work certain providers last second. Yes, causes problem. can't national exclusive deal benefit couple companies without informing people actually charge making sure happens. 
It’s really easy play victim life blame government problems instead taking responsibility actions.

Again name calling, know deep you’re better that. glad hear that. often include bitter agent (and dye) well try prevent children drinking it.

But believe due way laws written methanol almost universally used. USA obviously best prepared. living dream world, Neo. It is the world has been pulled eyes blind you from truth  don’t understand held event. Exactly. made prediction 2 weeks ago guarantee accurate ""experts"" predicted 400,000+ US 2 million+ world wide end year.

They need rethink models communication. Making predictions end far gives fuel already doubting type expert surrounding virus. \*Thank doctors schools get covid traffic lights shows CO2 concentration. advised open windows every 20 minutes 5 minutes each, really get cold inside. years flu vaccines approved 10-15% efficacy

how much population would protected case, assuming many people even take flu vaccine?  expect go 30% three weeks, then.

When hospitals run capacity, death-rate happens? usual answer easy. let Republicans take charge There’s coronavirusUS specific sub. Maybe create follow one australia Repost yesterday read doesn’t imply minute measles would controlled without vaccine. means local settings transmission slowed (for measles) people infected. guess “just let everybody get infected” doesn’t sound scientific “herd immunity”. 

The alternative view middle road avoiding lockdowns using infection control measures slow spread save lives vaccine. Trump? saying: shy end dead 

You definitely anything wrong, lets clear beginning pandemic, knows things look like got infected 5-10 years now. lot cases people struggling go back gyms can’t breath. Lets forget brain fog.  like current ISS oxygen situation. plan took years years prepare, edit, drill, review. one day pompous dick small-handed astronaut takes whole plan shoves airlock presses big red button. FML good Canadian. Slight bias detected. shit need long term plan. Mandatory masks social distancing next 5 years minimum. Half capacity restaurants bars. person sports events least 10 years. help drop cases bit. consider maybe lessening SOME, restrictions. Though many (masks public, half capacity restaurants, etc.) permanent end time. Two words: Trump administration sad excuse person. take longer vaccinate majority world's population.

so groups considering here? read somewhere hopefully children need vaccinated, they're lowest-risk immunity adults protect them? really question? Lol grandmother basically solitary confinement since February. canceled programs let room except meals, sit far away anyone talk them. Frankly I've changed mind decided *the vulnerable* strict covid restrictions flat inhumane. like even call enough make level confinement. 

I really think would better try contain retirement community much outside contact stop trying block transmission inside. Yes, could lead worst case scenario, entire country worth old people spending last year dying lonely alone anyway. nuts. 

No easy answers.  Lol quick people thank lord won’t 🖕😷🖕the lord problem thank lord solving. 

Stupid fairy tales flawed logic. 🤦‍♀️  qualify sick though? allergies make feel like I’m getting cold least 1 2 times week Im netherlands right (came scotland) absolute joke here. one wearing masks recently people partying, going work, uni open. literally could tell theres pandemic. TRUMP happened. going hard winter.

It's going good winter ""selling supplies hospitals"" business. Trump threw pandemic playbook ignored scientists.

Anti-intellectualism fuels dangerous behavior individual level well. tend agree - COVID shown happens rubber hits road pandemic plan bus.

Source: I’m American. 🤦‍♂️ Brilliant. Maybe can, instead, focus wearing masks. Happy Cake Day! Stay safe well. Impatience. 100% agree Another anecdote, know maybe 10 people indirectly covid 0 people directly.

One 10 long covid - friends mum, 70s probably. former Wisconsinite (still 100% heart) sent bunch masks made little brother family yesterday. Stay safe everyone.

Fortunately provincial premiers smarter “Himbo” Trudeau, listen scientists..

This infobyte written show Right wing parties stupid egotistical ones. One word... Trump! Vaccines need safe effective.

Safe? Check

Effective? TBA Covid19 taken fewer life-years single year traffic fatalities.

But differences covid forces extract pound flesh, whhat *acceptable circumstances* bars open. Since apparently bars open covid means blood hands, open influenza life despite fact large numbers people also killed influenza. agree difference degree. talk difference type. idea argument can't used someone saying 10s thousands deaths unacceptable threshold. UK they're considering going lockdown again, I'm seeing folks refer report says lockdowns work. Like, damage cause sectors warrant temporary reduction infection rate, something.

If lockdowns work, suggested alternative? country rising cases chose go lockdown, would country accept infection rate increasing exponentially vaccine produced? airlines work without social distance? I'll take It’s amazing many downvotes angry comments get post factual statistics go mainstream narrative Dog im doctor look slightly course herd immunity, normal sense, isn’t possible- doesn’t occur anything, ever, without vaccine. people get immune (population wide) smallpox hep B HIV varicella anything else ever? can’t believe thing people even discuss.  Cases clinically significant number. Show death statistics. kind ridiculous college going to? That's fair. Bioterrorist trump LOL, go back r/conservative. alt account showing — calling universal health care ""socialist health care"". joke! Come back actually degree, training, experience have. caught numbers someone already explained context living profit health care system like. pretending skeptic clear denier. know never lived anywhere else except America. ignorance shows. Google spout numbers Republican propaganda mean authority subject equal — someone actually first hand experience skills field.

Deny want. myopic view trump work do. know, country actually get save people doctors. state 0 new Covid-cases, community transmission, stockpiles PPE trust statistics literally everyone gets easily tested even they're jobless homeless. realize governors make decisions state, right? counties decide whether follow guidelines, cities decide whether override certain policies. TRULY think president United States ability even power single-handedly control things severely ignorant. realize makes feel good blame trump everything bad. guess would fine also gave credit everything good. Regardless, reading do. mind all! ^_^ I’m sure first half actually true. 

The nature rugged individualism, general distrust authority (healthy unhealthy), massive population living many many many different types conditions/places/families...

Economic scientific standing aside, fighting pandemic US would always nightmare information wise, logistically, disparate local level. 

After shit Teflon able survive, I’m happy irony may prove actual downfall global crisis likely would fucked whoever office matter much better obviously would dealt it. Two words: Donald Trump. scares hear USA, health-workers get sick treating patients, get covered hospital? true?  CHINA that's ABSOLUTE FAILURE!

Wear masks, destroy businesses, economy hide!

Look Sweden, had....oh, like 1 death per day?

The era post-truth. I'm someone worked infectious disease research scientist 10 years respiratory safety admin institute. frustrating hear US politicians talk preventative measures CLEARLY understand simple principle. Oh, event outside...so safe. Oh, everyone tested prior meeting, safe. Oh, sure indoors distancing everyone wearing mask safe. Oh, person wearing mask contracted virus, therefore masks ineffective.

How simple concept elusive people? Masks last line defense, supposed perfect shields. also preventing transmission protection, especially cloth masks. Yeah, go first. Trumpeted abilities. called ""socialized"", know, opposed ""privatized"". fact form vitriolic opinion antagonize account inability read, let alone assuming I'm ""he"" apparent reason, shows kind frontliner are. here. live outside Denver I'm going that. silly. evidence clearly shows people almost always catch thing indoors, house parties, bars, public venues. Walking dog trail outside safest activity do.

I appreciate Coloradans taking seriously, please treat us like we're stupid. true? Billionaires became trillionaires what’s question again? Ah OK misunderstood. Karens fat never played sports whole life. college high school sports, well organized youth adult leagues


TIL covid doesnt spread sporting events still answered many diseases kill many people Covid-19 has? happen ?!? Oh, yeah, years ago... Source. gave reasons, give yours. sanitizing equipment stops spread things-bacteria, funguses, etc cause skin infections. Interesting approach. terrible smell taste, actually works, would good additional measure situations higher risk, like air travel shopping. Chump. It’s called rose garden massacre want people infected event die. got pre-maturely excited. would piss fire. Dump people please ?? 1/100,000 occurrence. happen anyone sort infection ever fuck goes Canada winter anyways Testing capacity low march april, can't compare numbers (in april France 150k tests/week, right 250k tests/day, big difference).

In France peak 7000 people ICU, right 1750 people ICU. know quite people work home. financial services working home. manufacturing people working design work home, maybe go one day week. 12 new confirmed cases Hong Kong yesterday. asian im surprised vietnam taiwan beat us (japan) sk too, thanks apps faster response+better protocols levels

There much less new cases everyday. not. listen podcast. specifically discussing problem ice way ventilation systems ice rinks designed keep ice cool minimal circulation air above. still go want. friends parents going Florida. Flying Toronto. come back April, quarantine 14 days. ok 14 days rather cold. think nuts insurance companies cover covid illness.  Can't take you, stack call options. happen--they political choice. 

A choice born hope endemic, highly contagious virus go away wait out, demonstrably untrue. best, okay job delaying virus short while.

They also entail catastrophic costs, economic ones (though severe)  hurt think critically what? do. looks like wall Game Thrones. doctors said Chad rarest 1-10,000,000 case happen super healthy 19-year old boy doesn’t smoke, vape drugs, happen anyone.

it's article mortgage sold them. thankfully process refi get away. Yup. Ivermectin, doxycycline, bromhexine, spironolactone etc shown good results multiple countries. hoping get conclusive data them. Immunity vaccines stronger natural infection. people getting enough immunity mild infections, leading reinfection, scenario would fixed vaccine. Anecdotally friends family hospitals across LA County well equipped currently. Fingers crossed stays way people know soon find relief/support. Wait, we’re supposed take seriously? someone warned us past 9+ months... ""Dear X, (Circle many applicable: death, poor health, bills, loss job, homelessness) nation's gain. Thanks helping cause."" Y’all hilarious. issue flaunting guidelines guidelines nonsense. shouldn’t need quarantine 14 days seeing someone tested positive, shouldn’t need quarantine 14 days entering New York Delaware. It’s total nonsense. 2 3 days followed negative test fine 99.9%. 

Harris r/coronavirus usually take different position - anyone doesn’t follow Cuomo’s, Fauci’s Redfield’s guidelines letter gets scolded, canceled, etc. Harris gets exposed, flaunts CDC guidelines, makes rules it’s fine fact gets praised. every state US bad either know monitor participants, seem like ethical dimension treat participants wait end trial see vaccine actively causing harm. missed too. clever Fifteen men dead man's chest, yo ho bottle rye. Oof. I'm assuming must mean 4 plates per side. going see influx sure holidays. parents getting sick dying cause kids weren’t careful wow, eat healthy? Universities tons fixed costs. think expenses 50 large buildings goes zero classes online? fire dining hall workers, personnel costs pretty much same. know fact local university invested zoom licenses, given extra teaching slots prepping instead teaching...those new expenses. ""BS"" me. 

I laying rationale university perspective. pointed pain put you. workers universities know taking 10% pay cuts. like makes sense university perspective, course, sure seems like made sense them. saying make sense trying assert perspective it--you paying worse product. point, make sense mean make sense university. Things get interesting lot manpower missing many patients end disabled unable work anymore next years. don’t know. I’m hard pressed see someone party admit wrong self accountability. guess bar set low, pride may justified. assuming based anecdote

It's time stop posting bud. 

It's time log off.  spread misinformation /r/Coronavirus. WSJ conservative rag. Fuck anything print. Firstly,, reinfections mean ""no immunity"" people.

Secondly, immunity vaccines stronger natural infection. people getting enough immunity mild infections, leading reinfection, scenario would fixed vaccine. check messages? contact tracers area leave voicemail messages send text messages.  Banks like WF hook colleges bank need account get loan/financial aid money digitally instead via paper check. people keep graduate, especially they’re field people talk lot. Duh you’re ignorant. shutdowns happen ppl refuse bare minimum. wear mask avoid large gatherings. ppl things, things would feel almost like normal. they’re not. Immunity vaccines stronger natural infection. people getting enough immunity mild infections, leading reinfection, scenario would fixed vaccine. anyone 1/100,000, mean, GBS triggered infection even bee sting. Still floods regardless Cornhole   Apparently L.A. Fitness keep sending emails saying come back gym’s safe. noses actually helps, cause getting sick infecting people much Dexamethasone pumped full of, believe. got gnarly side effects...but seems work. come EU second waves yet? lag behind first one too? blame him. TRUE leader what's best Country occupants. rich ones. spread misinformation  People downvote see don’t want hear. truth hurts core! tricky part ""while sick."" Lots spread seems happen people realize they're sick.

Still better trying completely isolate 50 million though. matter many young healthy people die. solution comes ignorance stupidity. that, much people die. seen anything yet, even tip iceberg. Cases went due social distancing, masks, likely greater amount outdoor activities rather congregating indoors. herd immunity. Deaths still stable low rate, great, number confirmed cases percentage positive tests keeps rising week week, worrying. disgusting bank still open? deaths lags 3 weeks better treatments lag Ah kind problem approaching this: Instead things differently, different things.

(In case find outdoors non contact sport/exercise gives 'fix') Untill find vaccine corona. It’s hot might think. might wane i.e. decrease number, scientists medical express article presumably know they're talking say ""we clearly see high-quality antibodies still produced five seven months SARS-CoV-2 infection"".

The study link prove reinfections common, within short time frame anyway, level antibodies wane. mention reinfection seasonal coronaviruses, related virus SARS 1, shown 17 years immune response level protection would actually provide, know obviously.

With regards Qatar study, fair enough, still trust scientists involve know they're talking about.

OK let's say 700 million high - let's say IFR 0.5% true count COVID infections 120 million, possibly 160 million given lag infections deaths. many reinfections estimated anecdotal evidence for? Still tiny fraction that.

Also there's probably selection bias towards severe reinfections noticed more. example, HK traveller noticed he'd asymptotically reinfected screening airport.

I still seen evidence massive high risk reinfection (let alone worse initial infection) within short time frame, people criticising evidence way. particularly matter think though, since I'm behaving way differently whether common vaccines rolled largely moot. \*Koch thats sold stocks gilead (remdesivir) back april, read numbers werent promising Argh! whole ""meant be"" ""guess time"" crap so... ARGH! 

***""I minding business; walking middle busy highway playing game cell phone. blue, run semi truck. surprised happened, guess time meant be.""***

Or worse:

***Why stop child running busy street chase ball? gets hit dies, ( shrugs ) time meant be.***

Taking absolutely responsibility actions effects actions around them. ( insert applicable explicatives ) didn’t parents mention that? said healthy. don’t trust word family friend Christie may asshole, he's fucking dummy. Complaining wearing mask prediabetic, obese, asthmatic, sedentary old man like making sure car mirrors perfectly adjusted driving wrong fuel tank. pass 400,000 new cases worldwide today. Previous time high 382,000 happened yesterday. many countries using drugs plus many more

they seem work get saying really think that's fair. That's trying find shitty excuse lessen fact 200K people dead.

The US also wealthiest technologically advanced country world, large population factors that. death rate compared total wealth abysmally atrocious, much poorer countries like Vietnam kicked ass pandemic control. Similarly dubiously: fewer Florida /: cases, one enough. 

At Tulsa rally, attendee said knew somebody died another person went ICU. still believe COVID serious concern. Sounds like still supports probably biggest inspiration people disregard regulations like masks distancing time implying abandoning possibility restrictions cases climbing rapidly. anything improve opinion him. He's pretty good creating illusion reasonable people party though. UNI tested student hall. 100% it, 10% showed symptoms.

When flatmate gets it, get test. also catch asymptomatics sometimes. ...which happen literally anyone Time move Canada. something considered fact scientifically repeated numerous time. even states article even sick 2nd time.

&amp;#x200B;

I dismissing article, people without background experiments done take articles gospel. much still unknown virus many news outlets use headlines get clicks care could spreading misinformation.

&amp;#x200B;

This NYT article states (based scientific journal) rare conclusion can't stress enough unless information comes vetted scientific journal/study, speculation fact. single observation hospital even ballpark fact. person even talking media it. I've seen analysis articles suggest stocks primarily dividend based end steering company towards worse worse business practices. 

It heavily fosters ""short term gain expense future, morals, environment"" investors always looking towards quarterly profits primary focus. Thanks, I'll check further. Low positive rates easy manipulate Best prepared... fuck off. absolutely evidence masks work general population. Tegnell ignoring it. like ignored evidence spread virus people without symptoms. said weren’t significant source transmission. Turns Tegnell dead wrong clearly linked terrible death toll care homes. Nature article goes studies Tegnell ignoring. recent study article July laws Sweden say chat prosecutors. Tegnell clearly broken law! mean millions... sex police going sex indoors??? Wow. wonder break magical 100K. Get new high score! Americans seem determined Jill themselves.  Maybe paper account 40% population self entitled dipshits Yeah here, tired ever changing goal posts. believe Fauci saw death past month 80yo+ said becoming harder harder live like hermits see that, done together, keep masks etc... taking life back. This!! Republicans hypocrites. UGH!!!! That's really option me. big friend group everyone knows other. several individual friendships limited overlap. people hang see 1-2 people daily lives...which still lower people work person live several people varying degrees social contact. understand point making, though. added context number tests October 15th approximately 1 million approximately 700k September 10. say problem country ""the illegals, etc"".

Mr Burns: son type got Covid. sick couple week better now! Hopefully stay well. Lmfao, ignorant. People like shouldn’t get allowed vote. We're trying figure holidays. always small group, parents, husband, son wife. live northern Virginia, going cold time holidays roll around us anything outside.

Every one family members involved potential scenario pandemic observant. socially distance, limit trips out, go restaurants, name it. parents mid late seventies, weighs many thanksgivings Christmases left. know desperately want us able get together, able figure way we're going able safely.

I'm going go visit weekend, I'm sure discuss this. need come plan allows us get together, perhaps us masked sitting communal dining table. really care food eating aspect holidays. think suggest there's way thread needle involve that, still get together careful way.

I am, however, super thankful rational discussion six family members, included. There's crazy denier bunch. grateful. European go Greece moment. mum looking flights yesterday fact!

So long test arrive self isolate get back, issue travel there.

My mum partial lockdown area go Greece wants.

So really rules broken here, optics all.

But plenty wealthy people still travelling about. luxury job depend telling paid self isolate. gop general seems unfortunately. Im glad one case. id really love see friends sister trapped lockdown zone. r/oddlyspecific lmao country ""best prepared"" majority access basic healthcare? yet that’s they’re trying done start comparing Europe's ""failure"" America's absolutely America get bashed. still even talking herd immunity seeing reinfections? expect realize thing that's prevented referendum removing monarchy mother grandmother's consistently high approval ratings, something seems keen repeat reason.  Wait... was? thought planned preparation scrapped fool President. didnt even care it...  Bring pimp cane you’re gonna slapping hos;)  Based on... Yep. This. guy whose name starts one drawn up, crew failed miserably execution. Trump. June

So odd filtered like this, can’t imagine why! gym requires masks point spread + sanitizing proven produce high amounts antibodies

In phase II trials. data promising enough continue phase III trials cautious making claims like phase III data available.

Efficacy determined study reaches target number infections results unblinded. depend shifting infection rates really exact date. Pfizer believes necessary safety data third week November would absolute earliest vaccine submitted Put gravy boat put drumsticks pilgrim! Dr Fauci told to!  guy works issue. He's pandemic observant entire family, includes wife three one-year-old children.

His mother also pandemic observant, given retired nurse. husband? much. still taking golf trips, still eating restaurants, name it. put employee uncomfortable position tell children's grandmother cannot hold husband do. best-educated people know think fake. *college educator* colleagues think fake. I'm glad socially liberal, atheist, queer woman conservative, religious, homophobic area country already taught one opinion define person's worth, otherwise would going major crisis right now, watch people great amount respect walk around talking political stunt. Trump disavowed early warning system Obama put place How...trump nitwit supporters, that's how. feels like genuine Lack education us politicians positions leadership right people govern. 

There’s vaccine stupid. preparation world means nothing people charge either ignore actively dismantle personal gain. wager would people dying certain locations ton cases, overwhelming facilities. we've high case levels months, whereas Europe spiking now. means lot supplies depleted, Europe months build reserves.

Also people stupid insist dangerous, therefore going hospital dying. comprendo bit suspicious title, US universal health care, high cost care, pandemic could easily bankruptcy families, let's forget low low minimum wage, good combo, making title suspicious begin with, Bröthêrs! found filthy Ŭnßęĺię˅ęr! Downvote oblivion spread seditious lies! So, except curfew, pretty much Italy Spain march april Apparently I’m conservative looking things objectively.  need return Florida Spain resources something administration organization something. grandmother's cunt uh helpful new word! Okay trying sound weird happens lawsuit strict lockdowns reaches high court could related Conservatives: Trump made America great again!

Also conservatives: hell would anyone expect us able handle pandemic? barely even ranked first! Trump No, expect listen fucking advisors knowledge experience put forth proper judgment decisions it.

It effects makes bad situation worse goof charge.  sarcasm. federal government rob hospitals ppe? Politicising issue? potus fears looking weak. That's top head. curfews miami, lot people went earlier lol Thanksgiving police break door arrest outside family members over. CNN article June 5th...""1,000 health professionals sign letter saying, ""Don't shut protests..."" Hey, do? Yeah, shit like Himalayan mountain range. never go back sea level peaks get bigger bigger. even think even k2 let alone everest yet. course look see difference without quantitate.

Yes, this. calc needed. compare areas. Multiple companies creating vaccine. That's millions, billions dollars invested. doubt herd immunity (whether natural artificial) happen. I'm simply asking people argue herd immunity long-term plan would be.  Fauci said (wait book comes out) reason never left knew White House would replace sycophant (like Trump done past positions). knew best place there, trying get common sense blocking blatant BS best could.

I agree that's happened CDC well: good people remain knowing could replaced anti-mask dogwhistler. China’s blame whole situation. tons western countries messed response. could really never ever prove case Cite this? Yeah, sounds like border probably going closed years that's criteria. Johns Hopkins one co-hosts event 201 along Gates Foundation others. Maybe tell one guys run president something. Yeah, I've heard similar. Ironically, poorer countries generally better placed deal outbreaks richer ones simply they've deal outbreaks recently, something may happening India apparently happened Africa. thought Russia made vaccine available anyone wanted it. However, see that's case?
Because phase 3 test subjects get it. mean say walked lab Moscow ask one, would get it? opt gene pool then.

I'll make difference. much optimism faith human ingenuity. 

Cheers! common denominator programming, credulous presentations pseudoscience superstition, especially kind celebration ignorance

It got even worse: pseudoscientists pretending real scientists, without *higher* understanding language. Don’t terrified. Flights nice - spaces hand sani everywhere. deaths worst part COVID-19, ongoing medical problems, US incapable handling them. Damn right. bad Preach it. 

Have many kids able raise. literally point anything else. CT room disinfected properly, therefore another 2 patients got CT scanned next day infected

Is first proof SARS-COV-2 last least 24 hours room temperature surface still remain infectious?

I wonder likelihood is? Given seen verified cases coming people avoid F2F contact still get delivery groceries/takeout/deliveries. Lol.

Sharp upticks literacy necessarily mean equivalent increase education.

That downfall Rome end really. Christian guided education ran wild without matching formal education, ultimately fracturing Rome giving late-goths easy entry (by Christians thinking goths would friends, somehow forget goths slaughtered too). taught kids shoot rifles.

For reason taught. hunting. It’s built excuse tell father suck I’m using lol kids may also knew lying clearly effort facilitate spread virus ensuring access protective masks sanitizer. still think part effort depopulate. Walgreens March April staff told ordered pull sanitizer shelves. agree. far pandemic cost job definitely testing sobriety well. I've watched special needs 22yo lose hard earned skills he's cooped home months. statistically would fine got it, going come side significantly worse wear isolating. Gyms never were, even beginning. convenient boogeyman. know state governments fixated closing gyms, beaches, playgrounds, outdoor/fitness activities. viral load may also play part. There's difference infected person coughing directly 1 meter away vs touching bus seat remains virus. media, governments rotten core.

OH agree, hate China invaded Iraq base lie, state controlled media back basically saying thing, Iraq MWD one dare question it.

What shitty rotten media environment country seriously screwed priorities. Also person thinks thanksgiving sucks? It’s worst holiday TIME hate difference see governments seem care, even population (equally) stupid. I've looking home gym gear, future. Looking commercial grade Iron Grip weights, like them. plate set alone would want (660 lbs assorted weights) runs $1,300. bar another $400 (maybe more.) that's go racks benches.

According friend's Qingdao think it’s great thing. Agreed. Berlin needs go emergency lockdown while. amount infections already two times one first wave. local government joke, trying please voters there's elections next year. really. always going small minority people would develop robust immune response (this happens many illnesses) people got infected different strain. people widespread vaccine helps protect. Hmm...maybe kids don’t want see tho....*cries shitty father relationship* Deadpool 3: Vigilante Covid Testing NZ. different treatment now? one-ace2-fits-all basically mean 10 times infected people back April? probably virus much community spreading February?

Holidays also tricky. hard time understanding kids can't trick treat socially distanced manner, go school full time. families told cancel Thanksgiving, siblings shuffling kids households attempt kids running feral parents work. point pandemic theatre precautions instead anything useful. No... really? We've known since April. total deaths Japan [lower year Whatever they're doing, matter half assed, clearly working, least metric care about. fight COVID-19, working disease attacks people differently vital. It’s sneaky, often kills also completely benign. there’s also another group sufferers: increasing number recovering disease end ordeal, it’s beginning. They’re regaining normal health, means tasks simple walking flight stairs continue struggle. Tom Steinfort reports, great worry scientists so-called COVID long-haul victims might bear scars pandemic rest lives rule Melbourne (Australia) mask mandatory time outside home, exception strenuous exercise can't wear mask medical reason. 

I think great decision blanket rule exact reason, otherwise could definitely imagine people thinking need mask they're quickly popping shop. 

I hope things improve Europe soon 🤞 Breaking news: published Stanford study (John P Ioannidis ) finds infection fatality 0.2%  True, global times et al propoganda outrageous still possible look past get level truths. Western media propoganda many ways worse subtle means many even realise exists.

Definitely agree last sentence. Said window-licker window. thought Europe control US idiots ignore science? Political theater. Corona virus weaker flu. losers retarded. Near 100% mask compliance too. we're selfish idiots. Yeah. hospitals test syntomatic patients, symptoms often tested beforehand, go nearest hospital, say I'm feeling awful without fever might get test(or not, almost roulette point). would appreciate Americans stay put unfuck country leaders kill us all.

But no, coffee. would want to? It’s cold 3/4 year. It’s fun country visit, would boring country live in. think always see Canadian tourists US? entire hall 100% infection time seems little excessive.

I mean, we've known since May possible [100% workers test positive they're forced work close enough proximity.

There's reason 100% people hall get infected. People even today positing theories percentage people ""natural immunity"" based past exposure we've known plausible months now. wishful, unscientific thinking that's founded evidence. far best option people.  TN visas relatively unchanged.

You need qualifications, they're renewed regularly, non-immigrant intent, e.g. go back, indicate plans contrary get swift boot. Tailgate season... can’t wait full stadiums (safely) again. first bite hot dog White Sox game gonna amazing. can't say disagree.



You're still fucking weirdo. distinction deaths new cause. didn’t know significant 200k deaths US compared deaths accidents, cancer, cardiac arrest. It’s lot extra death. 
 People havent stopped dying causes, adding another way die isn’t minor. money important, picked wrong. Welcome adulthood working home. people much less appetite lockdowns economy much less capacity additional stimulus could make winter much worse 1st. happened Spanish Flu, 2nd year came around, lot people sick complied far less restrictions. That's bit arrogant. countries better you, Chosen Ones. Great news, Covid fixed that! Look post history man. Fuck Trump. Like president, got one not-yet-approved neutralizing antibody cocktails, Eli Lilly one. Theoretically improve prospects considerably. Must nice well-connected get medicine unavailable others. think mean vigilant, although vigilante testing sounds hilarious. Ain't exactly metro Toronto either. :) Please read actual study headline abstract. 14% mild cases symptoms longer 30 days control group also 8% non-confirmed people symptoms. confirmed cases slightly unconfirmed cases. 

Also symptoms self reported. prone wildly inaccurate. Also anosmia listed symptom right alongside tachycardia headaches. severity. Also it’s preprint. Also actual number experiencing symptom longer 30 days ~10%. Also “serious” symptoms found strongly associated covid long term study headaches memory loss. strong association things like tachycardia fibromyalgia like illness 30 days longer.

Again, read study. Strange. 

He’d clearly find insufferable. agree shutting indoor dining France would go long ways decreasing numbers. far comment egotism, I'll stand opinion formed long covid came along. Yeah country even bad truly cold weather yet... Yikes rare, handful recorded cases. may true, given don’t live go information find online. seems odd epidemiologists would lie protect French government’s philosophical position, live US entire government mouths surgically attached Trump’s hole. lens, makes sense. true, exclude CCP mouthpieces. perfectly okay call out.

Tbh, media, governments rotten core. He/she right though: Abschnitt 5 §32, part ""Freizügigkeit"". 

The IfSG crazy strong law. face India finally back number one daily cases lucky spread community. Lessons learned incident. Indeed!  comes over, study study, Vit deficiency leads much poorer covid outcomes. papers early February, supplementing since March.  Also mostly young adults getting infected vs. older people first wave. case, would ~~2nd~~ (technically 3rd count Antarctica country) China given Australia 6th largest area country world. Alas, 99% know it, greatly lower risk virus simply cheaply supplementing. Imagine world one D-deficient - would pandemic look like? need get word out. Yes context amount people contracted disease 1/3 quite large amount considering vaccine supposed make immune. Though much Japan year cases confirmed vaccination status 700% people vaccinated MR vaccine contracted measles compared unvaccinated people.

Population size vs cases really mean anything know amount people actually exposed measles, like entire country exposed MMR 81 people contracted measles.

The original herd immunity theory states needs 68% population immunity disease achieve herd immunity confirmed natural immunity (contracting lifetime immunity measles). 

In case MMR though still get measles even vaccinated ever determine percentage population actually immune? can't determine concrete percentage logically determine whether herd immunity? r/suddenlycuckold \*Sarcastically laughs Czech 90 cases day per 100k people\* Quebequoi? ones worse outcome symptoms outset earlier isolated treated mild cases/ asymptomatic ones get overlook. that's major disadvantage virulent strains seemed thinking Reformation, secrets Earth orbited sun. lot people used stars navigate seas knew Earth flat, probably nobody dared talk it. lot scientist afraid make discoveries known.

Today lot people know COVID-19 airborne spread testing positive, people still believe scientists. Trump fired many scientists issues global warming. guess remain Positivity rate, hospitalizations, deaths up. completely independent testing.

But keep drinking Trump Kool-Aid feel like white house pushed say back then. There's way sort widespread vaccination election, despite Trump says debates. still program experience severely restricted too. They're limited one patient instead usual 3-4. hospitals prevent cross contamination. didn’t say anything numbers. Look usernames. remind COVID 1st hit. people first blew up. area, shops require wear masks want enter. official rule, one made owners. Also, wait line outside like 10 ppl store one time wait someone leave. Honestly really surprising see diligently followed indian people really known following rules type NPI strategy never recommended. incredibly damaging work.

No public health agency recommended behavior January 2020. single one. Suddenly world thinks settled science lockdowns masks work, ignoring decades evidence contrary.

Lo behold, months cultural revolution plan never used unworkable...isn't working. Aint gonna let homejail without due process. committed crime. 

Not arent diving head another lockdown 9700 cases day, 30% positivity almost 90 cases day per 100k people. 

But still, gonna imprisoned. effing way. Kerala , state best facilities India CFR 0.3%. IFR much lower given 17% positivity rate missing many cases. script ""everybody gets together holidays."" like every year.

You forget add ""and isnt carrying deadly virus."" I'm demanding change every single year order suit complaining Internet ""be flexible"" accommodate.

Interesting, I'm either. People already explained purposely obtuse. offered celebrate Christmas parents different day, different choosing go. course know ego let admit wrong keep playing dumb. also want admit carrying virus Christmas normal either reasonable thing would sister BIL actually follow safety precautions safe celebrate instead dumb selfish. living safely cannot normal Christmas less risk getting virus. also want admit I'm dick offering different date celebrate justified upset originally asked back fingers pointed sister BIL following proper safety pandemic putting everyone risk putting position either come find different date. 

But sure keep arguing Christmas pandemic somehow normal expecting people live safely normal. Quit dishonest. sure else want say, answered question. Gerrymandering factors percentage people vote given area.

If enough people vote, might mess math enough flip critical districts. official numbers, +50% carriers asymptomatics takes close 1 million per day... thats entire medium size city, every day... brace impact! realize people need money feed families right?

That's good thing, makes better person Donald Trump. bar low, think deserving stars. 6/10 shit stains, instead 8/10 rest party. He's still shit stain, he's less shit stain.

And that's really crux it. *have* shit stain. choose be, turn entire life around wanted. hasn't. He's simply admitted wrong one instance, long offensively obvious every rational, honest person walks earth. 

The damage people done, lives lost, futures destroyed, irreparable harm, harm still intends do, likely unforgivable, he's really asking forgiveness. He's willing concede point, he's impaled it. Meh, months. youth simply making impatient. pretty well documented problem. :) !remindme 6 months Go on? Right I’m looking examples death reinfection US They're lot better nothing man, absolutely build bench. powerlifting coach big advocate, benches 500 lbs elite lifter class. outlier, sad yes still outlier.

Young people die time diseases, illnesses randomly.

In Germany example 2 examples people 20 dying 85% deaths 70.

As long thousands young people dying everyday it, sadly outliers. You’re getting downvoted good question. Reddit crazy likely body produces immune response worked well, thanks good read. Yeah 4 confirmed reinfections almost 40 million cases doesn’t seem like something happen often certainly hope so.  say anything best, Sweden's corona reporting extremely accurate, especially compared countries falsifying numbers flat missing half cases. Excess mortality comparisons show clearly. Fair enough, bad.... watch television? news? Sunday Night Football NBC? Academy Awards? Voice? SoFi Stadium L.A.? list goes on.

A Canadian company behind video production equipment used almost everywhere.

They even video equipment International Space Station ... also reminds mention 'Canadarm'.

Better nothing become endurance exercise unless find way weighted. pullups agree 100%. rona lockdown park. Nerdy math: 19 mortality expectation around 0.007% 1 14,000. [1] 20 million Americans aged 15-19 [2], 50% prevalence would lead ~1400 deaths age range. far 374 tested deaths age 15-24 [3], consistent around 10% prevalence.

Yeah, co-morbidities raise mortality factor 12 (no source). seem baked age data already though (most old people co-morbidities; young people not). Death disease appears entirely random. 1,500 still large number though (fewer die car accidents [4], though course spend lot reduce every parent rightfully worries them).

And outbreak year saw 62 one state. year 81 cases across entire country 25,000,000 people. 

The first document states 2nd dose MMR added schedule late 1992 point infection rates dropped per graphs statement. would conclude herd immunity achieved via MMR.  It’s almost like years tuition hikes backfiring students learn getting ripped Zoom classes. 380k+ day before. Stay vigilant safe, y'all. IFR equally useless.

The accurate figure calculated using patients known outcome. Globally representative sample 30.5 million patients known outcome. 29.4 million recovered 1.1 million died. quite clear. 1 27 diagnosed covid19 died.

They definitely overshooting numbers certain places like NY nearly enough beds available, might croak relatively mild pneumonia.

I'd get bed. Strong, 50, good insurance. super careful first I'd hated woke stack dead Boomers. Still overly careful. Isolating risk groups, allowing infections healthy people overburdening hospitals etc.... would take long, probably least 6 monhts would end part herd immunity. 

This going long haul, matter what. That's baked in. I've saying months we're going sniff normal summer '22. 

Look, complaint everyone misreading, griped binary nature debate. Individuals living *households* folks low risk infection allowed movement contact. still ready self isolate 14 days drop hat, get tested, cooperate contact tracing, wear masks, social distance, etc.

No, ways proven used genetic sequencing prove two different strains (therefore, can't remnants first infection). 

We idea rare common is, kind genetic analysis simply available many people. Based IFR estimates US Covid+excess deaths, guess US may somewhere around 45M actual infections.

I hope vain(obviously) see punished crime people. Wisconsin study done July turned 2 3%. I'm sure most, 10%. surprised U.S. whole around that. “testing everyone” thing, literally goes anything we’ve ever done history viruses it’s nothing, causing people panic. one working saliva based test everyone’s concerned testing? It’s absolutely ridiculous keep hearing numbers reported cdc PIC (pneumonia influenza Covid) America - we’re already lower death per week rate P&amp;I (pneumonia influenza) 2017-2018 current PIC rate (so three combined - still lower.) - source: 2: don’t understand people think going - know history say way world responded viruses past look death rate actual disease - continued panic must end - what’s killing people point isolation, putting people form folie duex, rapidly degrading mental health - along failing economy, that’s helping proper means take care themselves, pay bills feed families. would much easier keep primed embers every corner every city waiting little wind get started again. kidding.  I’ll stick clay tablets!  Kids today darn easy. find somewhere 45s stock 3 bucks pound let know. Isn’t strict rules claiming someone COVID19 death? need 90 % start pandemic. Arguing facts. Next up: running headlong solid rock.

You got this, champ! it! There's reason century belongs China.

Democracy fair weather form government breaks actually serious work done. Democracy encourages myopic welfare state politicians tell people want hear short term. easy short term solutions run out, democratic governments become unstable. See: Italy, French yellow vest protests, etc.

Meanwhile Singapore example enlightened dictatorship, perhaps China disregard concentration camps (which Chinese perfectly fine with, Westerners like Muslims anyway). would argue US never best prepared. 

Germany 8 [hospital every 1,000 people. US 2.7 hospital beds every 1,000 people. 

Germany 38 ICU beds every 100,000 people. US 29 ICU beds every 100,000 people. 

On Germany 4 doctors every 1000 people, US 2.6 doctors every 1000 people. 

Those stats show Germany better prepared pandemic. course adding cultural factors. US lowest score ""Public trust Government"" article mentions, German's generally trust government advice. 

The original report US ""the best prepared nation confront pandemic"", always flawed take. sorry one informs u/Izghome children cold war need ""news"" know newchina. Unless say want CCP destroyed want chinese people free democratic elections revolving leadership, gonna listen exactly 0% say, anything. chinese government going keep pressing expansionist hopes europe stops food export china chinese people carry fanatic, one rubber boot meal time. hope enjoy today, life belong government. seem correct. 

When someone gets PCR test, generally tested strain. Or, least, strain recorded. swab generally thrown testing presence COVID. 

When person gets infected second time, would go back original swab test strain prove reinfection, generally longer exists therefore impossible prove reinfection. 

The people proven reinfection people reason strain recorded swab still exists still tested.

Ultimately says American's appetite self-praise, reluctance take honest assessment, inability conceive calamity means. really clear anyone isnt American. Alright, here’s tl;dr: wrong.

Peak daily deaths around 1k (1400ish peak) peak daily cases 60-70k. opposed 3k 40k respectively April. sure incredibly significant, nobody ever really considers that. 

Yes, people still dying, terrible. I’m saying “problem solved!” peak cases go roughly 50% deaths reduced roughly half (if more), pretty remarkable. fear mongers media (who often seems literally rooting catastrophe) choose ignore that.

So, yeah, deaths down. They’re zero, obviously want be, sure down. Doesn’t mean relax all, acknowledge it.

When peaking 70k summer, people saying thing “wait weeks.” Deaths NEVER even came close April levels despite massive increase new cases.

So, yeah, deaths quite literally down. Actually, peak deaths literally (by 50%) despite peak cases (by 50% previous peak) weeks before. Dumb people like plan set black man crumpled threw away fired anyone involved. Never bothered replace it, still tried blame office three years. president administration. even reading question? problem obese, unhealthy population thinks, “fuck guys, I’ve got mine. Blame someone else flaws system.” It’s culture problem, it’s made even clear people thread blaming spread airborne virus current president. mean, whole situation gets less... agressive, means come here. lovely large portion population abides common sense. Im 20 years old, see classmates less worried. keep distance wearing masks (its always outside anyway), could much much worse rest world?

I assume include limited number countries definition ""the world"", [because rates low compared everything still track then. Q4 original projection. would easier reopen. Okay, Sweden single-digit deaths now? Clearly worse neighbors. I'm curious death total hospitalizations low now. that's story goes. Donald. J. Trump. Republicans human, technically. They're viruses themselves. Assuming rate stays same, sure. There's guarantee there's nothing done stop it.

7 top 10 deadliest states per capita instituted lockdowns, masks, it. 10 10 mask mandates point (AZ allowed local rules). *nothing* do.

Journalism dead. turned shit show bury Trump election. Ah, makes sense. arbitrary LOL

Does covid spread 11pm something?

Where hard data covid contractions higher 11pm?

This like arbitrary lockdown rules Nee York State, make sense. example: ""if want drink meal. Wings arent meal, sandwich meal."" -Literally Gov. Cuomo honestly probably is. mean, Fauci article literally acknowledged fact spotlights him, forced conservative  CDC really best world

Are referring CDC said need worry wearing masks early pandemic, medical professionals knew needed wear them?  Look right like, difficult question, it? happens government concerned looting country governing. think ever better prepared countries like South Korea full delusion. never even dreamed implementing measures, government public, control virus. Donald trump baby everyone gets vaccine there's real chance wipe thing entirely though. forget medical bill :D posted link Trump claimed.

You can't refute said it. fact. Read link. predictable. Look wars US engaged - declaring winning vietnam throwing bombs carpet bombing vietnam cambodia. ""mission accomplished"" Iraq. Totally deranged foreign policy - cant win jungle cant win sand. going fight virus? even need baboon Trump mess - Bush would done same. anyone consider country without universal healthcare weak social safety net best prepared country? Well course. elderly people usually wary want spend time family vs unnecessary risks. always course, that's experiences family friends family. grandmothers safe this. shelter place, always wear masks try limit group interactions much can. I’ll give hint, starts “ T” Yes. terms priority, consensus, opposition. know huge gap. never seen coalition many legitimate academics sign something huge, dismissed hard. like conspiracy theories like 9/11 inside job. BS, best prepared. 

Privatized hospitals cost cutting years satisfy investors. That’s don’t enough capacity. 

PPE stockpiles squandered let expire. That’s government originally said masks help prevent spread virus. 

We prepared “plan” Obama admin doesn’t mean shit private interest fiscal thriftiness gutted health system’s ability implement plan. No, really know talking about. Spend time sub look preprints. single thing said correct. one. 18 deaths day ND 24 deaths per million.

Only hardest hit northeast states, LA AZ ever reached Every time talk one restriction reducing advocates thing. raise false dichotomy 'perpetual lockdown' 'no lockdowns ever' argument 'lockdowns sometimes'. getting ridiculous. U.S. health care system designed maximize profit. situation system must maximize health well-being... Well, expect? hope, measured phase 2 vaccine trials. not. Thems claim love someone says like is.

Can't handle actual human says like is. interesting see excess mortality turns entire period March 2020 (when pandemic really started Sweden) March 2021. harvesting effect well continued social distancing measures (which also effect flu infectious diseases) continue keep death rate average, long death rate Covid-19 increase. question whether matter excess mortality, mortality displacement. dont buy it. Clearly, original report biased wrong. facts speak themselves. I’m MA. experience gym. It’s honestly pretty great. think climbing scene friendly towards COVID responsible though.

I go gym RI occasionally - thing. 

No reason shut IMO. I’d pissed state blanketly closed gyms. ones I’ve great job allowed stay open. ""Best prepared""???? Without universal healthcare, insurance tied jobs, co pays, something like big pharma shittin little guy, wtf expect???!! ""Worst prepared""... Whelp also including people it, tens millions, so... strawman true, saying general population risk Lol big pharma going charge much treatment? 50,000 dollars per patient? Good kid getting paid gotten more. hurt feelings proving wrong. Weak. Prepared way? Financially perhaps, agree every way, prepared all. can't even recover now, instead keeps making matters worse... mystery? think not. Whitmer acted two laws. One 1945 law unconstitutionally gave legislative powers governor per MI S.Ct. 1976 law allowing governor emergency powers 28 days. issue second law continual extensions. declare new period previous runs rule essentially perpetual time limited. issue legislature needs act.

Edit autocorrect. read article, maybe it’s we’re overpopulated fuck don’t totalitarian government? groups hate current administration, need direction it? implemented make sure elections went ahead point probably was. even best plans fall apart sabotaged moronic, self servimg, partisan hacks. 10-15% efficacy means masks social distancing going away anytime son. lot people leaving lol.... No, I'm listening linked there. 

Don't give bs. Gee know anything putting reality TV star Whitehouse could it?  healthcare affordable Germany many non US - countries. need media use terms, ready, available, widely available, etc. hard keep track.

Because AFAIK, vaccine probably approved UK November. answer Republicans vote Republican. soon Republicans gained control executive branch Senate, end long list legislation place keep us safe. A)

If feel vulnerable vulnerable.

If know want go out, don't.

If know vulnerable, whatever want.

If vulnerable care, go out.

It ties responsible safety.


B) That's plan, first off, would lower chance global economic disaster we're pretty much fucked awhile. 2nd, biomathematical PHD professors saying best approach actual safety.

Again let reiterate. cause DEBATE. LEGITAMTE statements. media Reddit censor ideas fast DANGEROUS. blocked his/her sorry ass. Can't civil discuss save his/her life. he/she admits troll, we'll better place, mean, WAY better place. US built upon idea individualism trumps collectivism. Thoroughly Reprehensible Unqualified Malicious Parasite Narrator: wasn’t month. gym go to, people honestly really good it. It’s rock climbing gym, definitely different mostly younger crowd somewhere like planet fitness. 

Gyms definitely done safely. Herd immunity government never let millions people die like that.

Quite opposite, perfectly happy willing it, actively last 9 months. 

Slashing life expectancy among general population 10 years neoliberal wet dream -- frees many many trillions spending healthcare pensions, handed billionaires. 

Their constraint optics it, see shutdowns situation becomes particularly apocalyptic, mass death stretched avoided, allowed encouraged point, think would matter. people become invested Covid big deal masks form control they'll anything defy mandate. county mandate see people flouting daily. We've also people city's local Facebook groups say get tested isolate symptoms. even openly said ""they test hospital get sick enough need ventilator."" Oh say Biden wins openly defy mandate puts place. 

The time people take seriously 10 months ago failure leadership national state level. think there's coming back that. country put trajectory January thing stops vaccine cure. I'm NYC well....the thing is, people looking busy, comes SPENDING LARGE SUMS MONEY - venues that, least one feels discouraged things.  Maybe fine dining longer technically falls category, since indoor dining started limited basis, intents purposes, still closed. voted trump 2016. America failed competence logic long pandemic. There's around 30 40 countries beat USA statistic Hubris incompetent leadership. can't tell parody account not. first heard military heavily involved Operation Warp Speed, imagined armored tanks rolling around nursing homes soldiers jumping out, busting doors, injecting everyone sight. Agreed. gym mask mandatory, people really good wearing it. feel safe there. It’s something closed down. 

The cardio machines set social distancing. It’s also climbing gym less people cardio. Crowded cardio classes even masks probably bad idea.  20% part diabetes, heart issues, cancer, extremely high risk severe covid. new information 

Over 50% overweight America, closer towards 70% range.

The 20% underlying conditions. die, also face high risk complications extremely likely hospitalized.

And, news flash, control spread, easily need vaccinate 60%. Unless want shit ton people start getting sick vaccine starts wane, worse get sick vaccine work them. also huge fuck conditions dont allow get immunized literally suggest need isolate forever control spread disease, despite tools so. Donald Trump betrayed last sentence.

*Enjoy staying indoors though that's want.*  want believe, therefore eager shout anyone brings little bit reality situation.

It takes time develop vaccines. That's true whether like it. 

You impatient, makes sucker expedited timeframes questionable claims. 

Con men succeed marks want conned. TL:DR: breathing test corona coming possibly end next month, rate picking 75% negative people, extremely useful testing areas! know sounds crazy, I'm looking forward studies show vaccines used conjunction other. I'll take multiple jabs truly helps protect! Greed. Christian obstruction.  Republicans. Plans good people tasked executing them. kidding think millions people around country numerous gatherings took adequate precautions. Trump Politics! how! sides government worried whose power us! Take note people, tax dollars pay for! Oh yes fingers crossed human filth falls cliff 🤞 Ah, Italy taking American route now. Platz.se official site. FHM counting suspected cases, unlike SPCR. lowest numbers come Socialstyrelsen count cause death = covid-19.
Under reported? Nah, SCBs statistic shows Sweden 3600 deaths excess 2020 compared 2015-2019 average  “Or pretend we’re gonna die within 4 weeks”

That’s what’s going happen. Never mind 3 cases millions people who’ve US. think either....but think degree ""we're getting money Washington matter dramatic act, might well cut crap."" course NYC, places probably closed high mask compliance LOLOLOL....one word......TRUMP exposed collective moral decay country well really keeps economy going (""essential workers""). also showed broken healthcare educational systems are. invested military. view national security issues - should. Wish nightmare already. thought point obvious I’ll try spell blatantly. Obviously don’t perfect information never will, saying it’s impossible make kind observation strategies utilized countries thus far pandemic. throwing hands saying ‘well, don’t know what’s going happen it’s impossible make form judgement’ doesn’t contribute anything conversation


While it’s theoretically possible could turn ‘hybrid’ approach US (although would argue even competent that, competent ‘hybrid’ approach would closer Japan managed it) could turn one best, doesn’t make likely outcome, doesn’t mean can’t make judgement US currently managing pandemic. suddenly changes obviously would require re-evaluation, saying future uncertain means can’t make judgement countries response ridiculous stretch. future always uncertain, never necessarily know happen right decision is. mindset would make impossible make kind judgement anything, since regardless things appear circumstances always change future ways can’t predict now. It’s non-argument. Yall gonna change tune EU worse rate USA next weeks? Two words : Trump Administration makes nation prepared fight pandemic? Id imagine there’s inverse relationship “preparedness” [Hofstede’s index I'm sure circumstantial consensus. group Harvard, Stanford, Oxfor professors. institutions houses research. concluding this. Keep mind, current model also untested. example, need experimental studies order draw conclusions. date yet completed experimental studies effectiveness current lockdown. example, competing evidence would wearing masks catching infection anyways. Also whether contact person entirety epidemic even feasible. words, ACTUALLY get ENOUGH people stop contact other. apparent not, spikes everywhere. Therefore, need find out, whether really good course action. need math, science. That's heavy big hitting scientists comes in, provides contrary idea. Neither one parties create controlled experimental studies given scope people have. observational. Therefore neither one come conclusions now. Yet quite quick dismiss anything opposes it. trusts science. true science means study every possibility, turn theories truths. Theories can't tested unless challenged. I’m really sorry hear that. That’s awful.

But it’s tough say reinfected didn’t test positive first time. Trump. That’s literally it. Politics superior leadership competence President Donald J. Trump course.  partly Darwin objected using theories humans. selection survival mechanisms natural ones. Trump admin coordinating states? must joking. One word: Trump one used treat Trump? guess still butthurt “tall” Obama was. south isnt learning shit Truly Reprehensible Unamerican Muppet Production. sacrificed them, altar laziness incompetence (from executive branch, doctors). lot selfish, stubborn, entitled people country....that’s how. could country without healthcare system works everyone considered prepared? Wah attempts manipulation soldier. 

China responsible another global catastrophe. Fuck China, cause pandemic! China Virus took world storm. Lies over! what's population EU? US shit stain country decades now. several studies found smoking reduces severity virus, even chart posted somewhere diferent comorbidities stuff increase chances dying smoking decreased it. countries Africa don’t really either. thing really crippled US massive conservative media engine. Total incompetence leadership idiot mention benefiting mooching everyone else wearing mask. wish militant ignorant would shut traps. blame governor individuals states vacationing here? Trump. Agree endemic problems within US society healthcare. it’s like straight B+ student given assignment, returning tattered blood splattered manilla folder words FUCK spelled excrement inside.

We expected mediocre response, Holy Shit. know why. kinda question this? Hmmmm, wonder. truly truly wonder clearly obvious questions. CDC: Let’s trade credibility little political power...

That swamp needs draining. Trump basically said “You’re wear mask” caused split probably quarter country. People completely see quarantine stuff political standpoint people listen experts field don’t even want risk catching giving families. get head gravity ass? it’s not, I’ve many restaurants. would nice see source that....otherwise feel made fact. theoretical mathematician academia. I'm early stages tenure track I'm quite paid 6 figures yet, within years goes well. top field paid roughly $200K year. Yeah. drink colleague summer Portugal - outside street seating. Nice cool evening. Went bar get next round, packed (traditional Portuguese boozer, mostly old guys). Half masks, like would make much difference anyway. 200/day point, bit surreal - cannot last thought. 2000/day, doubling every week... early October, Andrée-Anne Chouinard takes care son, contracted COVID-19. worries. believes immune, fought disease five months earlier. symptoms returned.

Suddenly headache, sore throat fatigue set in. October 5, preventive measure, neuropsychologist called employer's health office.

She told could residual symptoms first infection, contracted working CHSLD outbreak last May. next day, woke up, sore throat intensified.

She calls health unit back, time invited tested. skeptical , admits. result arrives less 24 hours. he's positive.

I surprised. think possible close time.

Andrée-Anne Chouinard
For second time five months, Ms. Chouinard therefore subject quarantine officially ended October 14. symptoms, says, less intense first infected.

The first time little serious. big three days tired, slept lot, eat, big sore throat, cough, painful. Big migraine too.

The 37-year-old woman, originally Quebec lives Montreal, says known health problems taking medication.

I never even flu, still surprising , sums second episode COVID-19.

Can speak reinfection?
Ms. Chouinard felt lonely, stumbled upon newspaper article. 25-year-old American believed fifth documented case COVID-19 reinfection world.

Immediately, says contacted public health ensure case investigated, necessary. officially speak reinfection, indeed necessary prove genome virus different second infection.

Since research begun subject Quebec, demonstrated case Ms. Chouinard.

Dr. Gaston De Serres, epidemiologist National Institute Public Health Quebec (INSPQ), however, considers case similar reinfection.

If someone first test three months later develops second positive test, still suggests reinfection. able prove it, going genetic sequencing techniques.

There many re-infections [scientific] literature, yet data allows us know frequency re-infections.

Dr Gaston De Serres, epidemiologist INPSQ
Dr De Serres says months answers many questions. Reinfection may effect patients, emphasizes.

Will re-infected people often alleviated symptoms? possible. contrary, equivalent symptoms even stronger first episode? also possible , illustrates specialist.

What immunity?
A study 735 healthcare workers contracted COVID-19 participate started Montreal.

The goal study really see detectable risk reinfection reinfection, severe , says Dr. Caroline Quach- Thanh, one project managers.

Participants followed one year. undergo blood tests every three months, addition answering questionnaire every two weeks.

Already, Dr. Quach-Thanh admits optimistic concept permanent immunity, even vaccine available.

There nothing tells us vaccine protect us rest life, already protects us year, able least cut transmission. Ultimately, may revaccinated.

For part, Dr De Serres recalls seasonal coronaviruses, known longer time cause mild illnesses , offer lasting immunity.

For COVID-19 coronavirus, yet enough distance know information, quite possible behaves bit like seasonal coronaviruses , warns. Trump found boring, wanted big rallies. much share general sentiment: 10% iceberg water visible. assume least 10% US population infected. Yeah, think actually need add one zero? Sorry typo one lol. Anecdote parents Attributed doctor. Gotcha.

Either way, math still seems off. One ten million quite seem translate 0.0000000001%. No. It’s supposed double-blind trial neither people giving injection patient knows it’s placebo vaccine. 

That’s understanding anyway. think roads go far north. theres polar bears Ontario Hudson Bay coast, roads go either. Recently, mentioned Canadian friend city 123,000 recorded 87 new cases day. replied entire province Saskatchewan (population 1.174 million) gotten 25 new cases day. Current objective: Survive. Depends certain cities/districts report numbers, RKI count bit 6600, Risklayer collects data directly official sources. Unfortunately, make much difference, since trend look good. Except literally tested positive twice

What part get

A months ago tested positive COVID antibodies september tested positive virus came like February symptoms can't imagine anything worse clean teeth living. Fuck Wow. I'm surprised seen someone say cases matter, deaths matter yet. speak French fluently, pretty much guaranteed teaching job Canada right away. hear many teachers regretting taking French school. True, glad that. dunno could work place masks mandatory people forced wear them... speak French fluently, pretty much guaranteed teaching job Canada right away. hear many teachers regretting taking French school. right decision. Get shit together America, maybe talk. SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE.

GOODBYE. Thank you! never good day Thunder Bay. **How border stays closed America gets America control?** Thanks, feels pretty lonely sometimes. People copy past article resume link Archiv close contact (within 6 feet 15 minutes) infected person means need quarantine. 

She could make change compliant guidelines. 

She going beyond minimums set forth guidelines. don’t know actually received vaccine placebo correct? Ignorance magical thinking people latching onto dumb unproven idea. Remember people mainlining aquarium cleaner? What? sounds like might racist something. Surprising hasn’t close contact communications director. believe that? I'm surprised. feel like safeguards getting moved back regardless number cases. mother works public school district, tech support went back summer bringing teachers back full time despite fact cases continuing rise. want another lockdown think necessary people encouraged stay home. want vaccine trial unless hoping fails. got vaccine, would want immune get coronavirus. would antibodies antigens=immunity infection. infection. rate, covid CFR pretty worthless. Testing covid wasn’t widely available spring tons cases went radar, numbers completely skewed. IFR relevant.  literally know guy tested positive twice 
If could go back time, would become ultrasound tech, dental hygienist, radiology tech. pay decently well don’t require degree certification. wish wouldn’t go admit trust statistics. define safe? got fuckin scientific evidence bud, absolutely talking dick. know temperature quilts people knit/crochet highs lows day, course year?

Do Covid deaths/infections. Wet rug? Might contain disinfectant would kill virus shoes. Might help suspect much. Temperature checks largely effective finding people virus. Spraying 'shit' sounds weird, I'm guessing alcohol type spray would stop expelling virus breath, like shoe thing, probably much. CFR also depends demographics outbreaks Australia lot testing also outbreaks aged care facilities. There's much evidence pandemic real, can't deny fully (they would could).

There truth powerful cannot denied. There's hope long-haulers thinking infections made long-haulers actually second infections. private life? /s

Anyway article long archive best phone. France talking about? Since May one lockdown, adopting real form distancing. Walk outside. Anywhere. see. Please let's see. seems elite access experimental antibody cocktails, regular people don't. Chris Christie got Eli Lilly one, Trump got Regeneron. really act like virus big deal, got access best treatments. people listen end sedated ventilator, that's problem (no reasonable person would mistake statements reality, right?). part making assumption based anecdote would consider *thinking critically* ? first dropped far many people willing sacrifice comfort limiting travel much possible abiding recommended CDC guidelines.

It saddens recognize actions small groups people distrust scientific consensus masks social distancing fear contact tracing confuse Medical forensic surveillance ""criminal"" surveillance conflated temporary emergency measures giant conspiracy.

It saddens people chosen ""do thing"" made measures even harder lift, threatened public health, endangered essential workers, extended need Extreme Measures willful ignorance.

It saddens tried long year Love neighbor staying public spaces, correcting improper conclusions based misleadingly presented data, respectfully adhering CDC recommended guidelines feels like everytime try turn cheek get slapped again.

It saddens feels though fellow countrymen chosen trust rumor conforms confirmation biases uncomfortable truths

It saddens avoid direct references specific groups people lest post get political, even think appropriate refer deliberate disinformation ""political"": point, dangerous lies. diminishing % survive first time likely survive next time. Darwinism that.

I'm sure that's true. I'm seeing reports people getting much worse second time around. We're leaving 2nd wave thought

The cold flu season starting see Europe. I'm afraid lol Interesting. Paul’s verses mention praying public?

Edit: First Thessalonians 5:17 says, “constantly pray” translated “pray without ceasing.” must learn pray worried, angry, hungry, sleepy, resting, working. must pray times. discipline must develop learning bring every thought activity God. 

Matthew 6:1 careful living righteously merely seen people. Otherwise reward Father heaven.

6:5 Whenever pray, like hypocrites, love pray standing synagogues street corners people see them. Truly say you, reward. whenever pray, go room, close door, pray Father secret. Father, sees secret, reward you” (Matthew 6:5-6).

In Matthew it’s talking praying recognition. 1 Thess it’s saying pray constantly. necessarily visibly mind go business. [archive link anyone trouble accessing article actual article long copy paste got archive article. hope helps. think get today, tomorrow quite likely though. Agreed. happy woman day go back office full-time, pray never forced WFH ever again. understand, know got vaccine placebo. actually case, seem newsworthy. He’s also US, hence go back came from. supposed humorous reflection ignorant unappreciative populous America.

I saying suck, would still advice young people know vaccines cause autism. Could COVID vaccine cause COVID autism???!!!???!!! know look recession US. Despite going fully lockdown economy ist still fucked like Economy anyone else. proven fact US economy decrease less. Ugh, hard disagree. Indoor activities thing keeps sane Canadian winter. Staying home March horrible. Meanwhile Quebec, gather 1000+ people religious gathering whike going second wave:

Spanish nurse, Joan Pons Laplana, known volunteering UK University Oxford Astrazeneca Laboratories COVID-19 trials, tested positive coronavirus subjected test routine control

 clear know valid vaccine recipient?

Either way, let's hope minor symptoms. Well suit what? would collect virus air, okay, keeps clothes. wash later disinfectant keep reusing it. could get result removing clothes get back, washing them, hanging out. virus hair/skin could washed good shower.

Yes n95 mainly health care workers works well everybody. might able get n95/k95 somewhere. can't get one those, go surgical three-layer cotton mask. Im Canada right now. reasonable expect universities campus fall, things like sporting events, pep rallies, etc... held?

Without social distancing/masks course summer, gyms mainly superspreading facilities made beginning pandemic...
Not sure changed... Yup. That's respect recovering drug addicts. Interesting indeed. case medical expert around: used spray, risk inhaling particles spray lungs? I'm asking inhaling fatty acids cause lipoid pneumonia knowledge, I'm sure amount type fatty acids causing this. would really suck balls could get multiple times seems like it’s problem immunocompromised people. However, virus mutates enough evade immune system yeah we’ll probably susceptible again. Luckily Sars2 genome lot different flu genome drastic mutations counteract acquired immunity probably going less frequent.  know know read campaign said vice presidential nominee, tested negative virus Wednesday, **was ""not close contact"" aide, Liz Allen, CDC guidelines. still pause travel ""out abundance caution line \[the\] campaign's commitment highest levels precaution,**"" campaign said. 

(bold mine)

In words, actually following guidelines, paused since ""close contact"" **per guidelines**. However, abundance caution, pausing anyway. Gee.... almost gives crap people around her..... true every country except America completely eradicated Corona virus America still it? seem logical that's everyone saying. true? Gross 2000 Portugal, 800 week ago, also 10MM pop. Restaurants/bars/offices/schools still open - yeah upsetting.  good. exactly want happen vaccine trial. Lockdowns work. fiancé work health care booked wedding venue end February get married June 2021. rescheduled wedding October 2021 saw 4-6 month grace period vaccine might readily available allow us wedding dreams. 100% confident guests would 100% comfortable traveling June 2021 access vaccine. estimated 10% (750 million people) disease still handful confirmed reinfections 10 months disease, remember 7 billion people huge pool genetic diversity, always rare people get chicken pox twice even though renders life long immunity. link scientific claims making comments tested positive yet change tune. I’m optimistic.  look link posted 

wyoming went 0 deaths/day .6 

Indian went 14 15

 FL unchanged 

KA went 8 16 

these huge massive gains likely go month progresses Something consider versus now:

When plague happening, one shielded seeing horrors plague first-hand. 

There plenty people don’t believe covid don’t know anyone who’s it. don’t see horrid scenes hospitals people saying goodbye loved ones zoom die hospital. 

People many ways shielding things don’t want see. In-demand skills also over-supplied/easily replaced, jobs higher benefit:pay ratio e.g. jobs still pensions, extra time off, standard WFH, good health insurance, potential performance bonuses, eligibility student loan forgiveness tuition reimbursement programs etc... Dude need stop arguing things literally know nothing about. stop. I'm sanitizing, all. super spread events fomites.

You need masks fresh, clean air. limits spread. 

I understand one wants huff masks absolute limit, gasping air. get rid them, going problems gyms. I'll wear mask goddamn doomsday. need lot better washing hands, I'm getting there. Anyone can't even manage little face covering deserves get.

I live Florida coffeeshop near office bunch boomer fucks sitting lobby without mask discussing current events (i.e., whatever old white guys talk coronavirus). 

I expect get shadowbanned saying this, legitimately horrible/bannable thing say, actually want every single one arrogant white men (it's always fucking white men; everyone else wearing masks) die. 

Masks suck legit make harder breathe, especially fat fuck like me. it! old fartucks need even try? AAAGHHH!

OK, better now. Farewell, hope see side. Trudeau living fantasy land expects Trump DC take accountability Covid. Hell, Da Chump (Trump) pedals Covid farce, possibly negative DC Buddies busy bumping trillions dollars Christ knows audacity try make welfare programs harder access people like need get ""real"" job. can't care. people leave university en masse, institutions bleed money fast. part. experience, covid damages you. heart patient going this. seems burn body makes sense. feel scarred inside certain way. wifes hands went numb parts like finger tips one hand still numb. Oddly, soles feet finger tips bright red. covid early protocol ""if aware dying, stay home."" People think I'm crazy, literally believe vitamin D3 kept us death. There's anecdotal evidence helps, vitamin D3 involved cytokine storm regulation blood clotting. Since one ""prove"" anything, might well take it.  Doesnt Canada cases per person US right now.

The US sucks Canada sucks much. lower population Lots cough, sniffles, sore throats, fevers...

Hospitalizations? I'm live nanny, I'll piggyback host family. visiting family either. mention NY is, incredibly, STILL #1 state covid deaths huge margin. absolute per capita. even close. states would need several entire pandemics chance catch NY.

The fact Cuomo barely gets blamed entirely due politics. Given isn’t speaking made statement live TV, I’m convinced he’s actually recovered means. takes weeks people fully recover. Maybe he’s getting extra roid juice like Trump. That’s really awful. don’t know many young, healthy people get seriously ill die “only elderly” BS gets pushed scrap heap horrible phrases. many. lack understanding, lack care. Every single fucker wears mask nose knows jack, care. might accurate that's 750 day close 7 day average 94 know neither lungs are, maybe suffer insufficient respiratory able wear mask. Labor Day weekend parties. UK expectation different US expectations. 

For whatever reason, UK emphasizing masks social distancing plans. They're keeping much outdoors possible.

The UK also verge putting Northern England back lockdown, plan seem working great. Julie Andrews shambles expect india lose top place saw 200k, 70k.

 Well maybe drug 70k, administration/observation fees might why. understand people America treating like staycation??? media putting show tip election certain direction.  work. plan ""everyone gets sick."" work getting people sick. Fuck yes!!! full heartedly agree this!! Totally different situations. People can't avoid driving work, go school, life. people want avoid virus, can. different ways preventing virus stay home feel necessary. People can't prevent hit drunk driver.

Also, inherent risk driving. could get hit anytime. still take risk. covid different?   Well, there’s positive this, it’s efficiency information vaccines phase III testing sooner now. Sucks it’s taking though. Canada produced anything BlackBerry??? McConnel outlier pandemic, possibly polio kid. Given company keeps though, might well tilting windmills far they're concerned. bit dramatic.

It's said three different events spread across savings event begin online Walmart.com continue Walmart stores. new year, customers option pick online Black Friday order Walmart’s contact-free curbside pickup service.

Without doorbusters store for, significant uncontrolled crowding stores. Czechia 8000 one day, population 10 million. 🙃

I try go anymore, makes angry. many raging morons either wearing mask all, wearing nose bullshit. Coronavirus: Yodel-Lay-Hee-Hoo! agree much said, rental property depreciation. purchase rental property $300,000 get write $300k immediately. Instead get deduct bit $300k every year certain number years (27.5 residential property 39 commercial property), know depreciation. simply system spreads purchase rental instead allowing huge deduction year purchase.

The rental property income producing. personal home not. income rental offset expenses, including depreciation. income generated personal home, get deduction depreciation.

This bit oversimplification many rules it, point makes sense special loophole wealthy anything like that. know people it’s shit show. Daddy trump told wear masks don’t like told do, they’re wearing them! makes fucking sense. necessary hospitals getting overwhelmed. Europe Latin America also cooties means people cooties.

Calls Trump multiple times without saying name directly ""No one cavalier infected infecting others"" ""Every public official, regardless party position, advocate every American wear mask public..."", ""It take leadership challenges trusts American people.""

Also says wrong wear mask around Trump ACB annoucement, results wildly random potentially deadly, take seriously.

I bet wears glasses. public official, regardless party position, advocate every American wear mask public, appropriately socially distance wash hands frequently every day. time, reopening every corner nation guidelines,"" Christie said.

Fucking-A dude. time someone Republican team said something rational. Props. Even though like you. Wait minute furries people trick treat did. S. Hemi countries near equator warm. NZ Australia virus well contained.

The exception? Argentina. distinct seasonal spike. state's contact tracing app, first downloaded last week September 422 hospitalizations, today we're sitting 799 :( show indoors unmasked options? see 2 people indoors masks 6+feet away. reason think family mind skipping year lmao remember getting indignant back spring states started throwing around idea restricting travelers NY.  Schools spent ton prepping online learning 

That complete bullshit. spend anything extra online classes. pain student, see makes total sense university perspective.

No, make sense. Stop making excuses greedy universities people work them. LOL, suck math. type suit seems bit pointless me. worried surfaces infected wear n95 mask, vote, get back, remove clothes shower straight away. forget wash hair put clothes back they've washed. sure. Good talking Can't disagree that. Paying pensions social security make rich people richer though. I’m even going entertain anymore.

PH measures useful, they’re sacrifice. masks, idea stay 6ft everyone isn’t household isn’t sustainable. ruins industries, jobs, quality life. expiration date. 

I’m saying expiration date now. I’m saying can’t socially distance forever. isn’t sustainable - economically, overall quality life. can’t see that, you’re stupid think eliminate PH measures today. not, never standpoint. 

Have good evening. Fish chips. Big Mac. Yorkshire pudding. Scampi. Baked beans. Toad hole.

You name it. lot incredibly unhealthy food. I'm guessing massage parlors exactly kosher, either. nice would figure *before* almost dying thing live LA praying miracle Wrestlemania next year. yeah. Probably going happen ): Reality state mind bro forests, slaughter animals, spew greenhouse gases  livestock corporations Smithfield Tyson bunched animals ever concentrated specialized corporate facilities, workers loaded antibiotics undermined immune systems.  one factors sapping world’s tropical forests ability absorb greenhouse gases. Released atmosphere, extra emissions drive temperatures help destroy animal habitats, forcing species butt another swap contagions.  operating razor-thin margins, forced sell reserves ventilators personal protective equipment satisfy investors management consultants.  throughout Africa Latin America losing end decades International Monetary Fund–imposed belt-tightening starved public health systems... \[Uganda\] 55 intensive care unit beds 43 million people.

The title could also said animal exploitation makes pandemics deadlier. practices also accelerating climate change causing irrevocable damage planet contributing rapid loss human life. Amazing lack $70,000 dose aborted baby kidney treatment, steroid cocktail makes think. un-GOP. That's one way it! literally asked follow rules everybody else. What? agree France logical United States comes allowing kids go back school. science told us time time COVID-19 little effect children age 15. United States understand science. seems though France may understand this, know fact now. change fact Sweden lockdowns significantly better France serious lock downs. logic still flawed still continues support argument. get paid enough, true (which also subjective argument anyways), they're necessarily paid well. u classmates feel? could blame them? problem is, Czech Republic testing capabilities. Around 25% (!!!) tests come back positive. end day President could address nation say (fill blank) regarding virus. single leader would Germany, Spain, Italy, Denmark, Switzerland, etc etc? There's single leader ""Europe whole"".

Equating UNITED States INDIVIDUAL countries different forms government, different leaders, different rights citizens pretty nearsighted. 

You realize countries like France, Germany, Spain etc also states provinces behave much like governors local governments.

So, think Europe sounds much like US. “Shut down?? There’s 3 reinfections nationwide lol”


Maybe reinfections exception? Maybe they’re common think predominantly asymptomatic? Maybe people never really recovered it’s still first infection? give optimistic spin?  I'm near anyone what's big deal?
Also area low cases Governor Burgum alive well. younger people get sick now. anything like 1918 things bad, thankfully young people stronger resistance. sub saying opposite US cases up, deaths remained down. don’t understand sub boner Europe. Anyone else burned fuck ""X country/ state reports XXXXXX new coronavirus cases, biggest one-day increase record"" posts?

Like, long keep setting new records we're over-run white walkers? Well considering state Supreme Court tossed Governor’s mandates, inevitable. shock.  Duh. Seems right. Second wave incoming Sweden. Man ""need"" anything. proving thought hard line Republicans. think people unfortunate circumstances deserve there: didn’t work hard enough, religious enough, right family, etc. find unfortunate circumstances it’s revelation. wow.... sewers horrible home avoid disease spreads feces 2 Victoria today 1 locally acquired new case NSW. Zero states.

So 3 new cases today entire country. Australia getting really really close. honestly think eradication possible, like NZ. succeeds largest country far achieved total elimination, believe. forgot virus, politicians told stop caring virus, doesn’t mean virus isn’t still Ah screw pretty boy!!!! got this!! America!!!! many others ready Were! dumbass. God love analogy. ""tilting windmills"", amazing book hear leopards eat peoples faces... told conservative friend, college’s anti-abortion club leadership, abortion, told “oh, well don’t feel bad. would’ve supported girlfriend got pregnant wanted one” Heading winter. Probably cases slow southern hemisphere countries. Shoulda masked whole time lets urge people also prescribing opioids Nòoooooooo....🤮 That’s nice way thinking quarantines lockdowns bummer necessary. media sensationalized everything sides case it’s warranted. death toll climbs everyday. sensational enough buts it’s not. LOL. really. many people graduate huge debt still working low paying jobs? Coronavirus, job market saturated people looking work find, including many years experience lost job pandemic. Seriously. I’m keen borderline NEETS telling cannot see family probably moneys right lol I’m glad making recovery, stressed healthy, taking vitamins (C,D), exercising. Christie poster child healthy. b.b.b.but ... use Trump-touted Regeneron ""cure""? 1. Bernie Sanders liberal
2. embryo “someone”, even was, wouldn’t entitled use woman’s body life support machine one second longer consents to. This. UK obese country Europe iirc huge risk factor covid know timing steroids tricky. It’s one reason think infected earlier announced. can’t give steroids early shuts immune system- I’ve learned. given second phase virus- it’s important immune system overreact.

It would helpful could ever know facts infection course treatment. Hold on?! There's pandemic wear mask?! information before?! /s I’d agree it’s partially fault... it’s also fact voting system corrupt fuck. many districts gerrymandered degree makes voting sacks shit like bear impossible. yesterday annivarsarry show man last year time first show crowd hot man miss wwes first aew show full capacity crowd hot whole night lakers played staples center night pop wouldve loud especially kobe depressing bubble 4th quarter ended celebrating crowd depressing  much care shitty person acts like shitty person. shitty people shitty things, applaud simply stopped one shitty thing. Christie is, always been, moron horrible person. fully acknowledge he's capable admitting he's wrong, he's also way practice leader should. Relax /s hate people experience understand. Go tell white house Chris, see far gets fucked up. Sorry :(

As compensation Justin Bieber back okay need almost die right thing REGN-COV2 =/= Remdesivir. know sound same, thing. Please read carefully future, get well soon, try little harder jerk. Germany well. don’t think it’s giving pass. Rather, seeing slow erosion trumps base better narrative country deal Covid. Maybe Christie slightly humbled reality wake call. doesn’t mean he’s totally seen light either. need make room folks too, even keep slight arms distance. Every person longer cult good move. want white knight, it’s likely pendulum continue slowly swing. hope keeps going way, won’t late us survive chapter life, least backup plan. hope Christie keeps up. Bro stop disrespecting turtles. McConnell sucks, like turtlea  say true ""vaccine"" around corner. even bother ADVOCATING herd immunity? hunker couple months vaccine good go, no? know TOLD vaccines even CONSIDERING natural herd immunity?  exactly. I'm quite years away since graduated college, time spent class, front computer, library outside working part-time, nearly full time job. never liked campus experience would enjoyed money savings class home instead. Yeah, amazed see say all. bar low, still small props guess. don’t get doctor’s note first (=priority). do, result comes within 24 hours. WOW business best interest, dare they! scenario local businesses would easier online option. whats bill ICU 7 days? much entire Republican party comes things actually ""happening them.""

The prosecutor Nuremberg Trials identified pattern came understanding evils fascism, absence empathy. yes flu cause pneumonia [long term Covid bulk know right? imagine, Trump actually would probably lot votes... mention, lives Dad day 105 hospitalized covid. get remdesivir antibody cocktail. fact, search convalescent plasma donor own, whole country ran AB+ plasma covid antibodies. found one NYC state NY deny request blood bank make direct donation. Glad Christie maybe change heart, albeit thinking mask go open everything. county's leadership failed us, care us, we're paying price lives. wouldn’t called stereotypes were. fake news!!! president said isnt big deal!!!! No, I'm saying get points coming obvious conclusion exhausting disastrous damaging options. man stops swinging baseball bat China shop deserve praise looking around destruction he's done others, saying ""Oh, probably that."" trucks coming? Fat fuck Repub.liclown requires almost dying virus 7 months pandemic start taking seriously\*\*\*\*

fixed you. call I'm Jersey You’re saying people frantically poisoning lungs avoid wearing mask protects respiratory disease? Sounds legit. lack compliance baffling. 

They complying Trump's orders orders religious leadership. There's plenty compliance, kind want. ....aborted fetus treatment....thats said. It’s sad bar low, encouraging Chris could still hop it. Hardly. Fighting obesity instead labeling ""body shaming"" ""body acceptance"" ""my truths"" would Chris Americans health, Covid Deaths, Healthcare costs wearing mask. Puts right Boris Johnson Right. implying fact NYC used careful reopening strategy, quarantines visitors high mask usage nothing lack resurgence compared Europe, almost one wore masks months things went back normal? I'm Germany, initial response amazing, follow-through sucked.

""Nothing do""? course not, mean measures justified. Manhattan bubble people actually afford stay home time smaller household sizes certainly nothing either. heed Sunbelt increasingly opening level normality personal enjoyment horrifying many places like live (Oregon) without increases cases hospitalizations (which still dropping major cities like Miami)

When think we'll start see deaths ""huge second wave""? death curve much decoupled case counts US Europe, now. Dude he's lying. Everyone maskless, knew stupid, anyway. ... Christie's death roll, trying recover capsising ship.. sucked bro. worst moment life. looking belt close hanging myself. 

Thankfully, well now. want anything trigger something getting back low moment. 

I wish could get therapy, expensive tried guy helpful. marked USA? always told 🇨🇦 war 1812. Donald buy us instead Greenland? I’m give count 3 open closet door! almost like attack contraceptives well like abstinence education, making contraception taboo putting lock key requiring parent purchase it.

Crazy works. “With people wearing masks”

There’s problem. Magic Johnson HIV 30 years mean go raw dog gutter whores HIV.

Hint: Money matters. Hes given 50 billion charity.  yes, offset income tax.  would tax money gone?  Would done good world? failed test people walking around cabin assume person remains seat masks properly worn. That's big assumption compared nose chin straps see wandering aisles today. Holy shit. actually made affirmation. Awesome! Jokes them, airline industry hardest hit they’re trying minimize losses long run. encourage others fly they’re sure hell getting business time soon. need pick republican literally says take Tylenol mentioned 2 things got yesterday. comment badly worded. ya President got Regeneron that’s it? okay rushed treatment okay rushed vaccine? - Donald Trump now. always problem. Surges spread out.

I'm basing view data data we've seen. Predicting unlikely worse case scenarios pure speculation nothing more. would think 4 states (none populous) 50 problems would good thing.  tried convince trump drop antivax rederick disagreeing points. criticizing direction vaccines going questioning expertise Anthony Fauci.

I think ridiculous people *in subreddit* start counting fixed point time. like say, ""off months"".  good news flair monoclonal antibodies available though. Remdesivir is. Hopefully trials monoclonal antibodies go well, sound like good thing vaccines make fast enough. summer riviera parties didn’t cause today’s numbers, going back work/school did. govt trying put blame private parties avoid shut businesses, including restaurants. Don’t play game. It’s money. Except Trump, ofc... ""I got covid, yeah, wonderful stem cell drugs got, much stronger before. wear mask tho, no, stem cell research going available you...."" thread locked due number purley political incivil comments. reminder, comments celebrating individual's illness wishing death result ban.

Please keep conversation civil. Thank you. literally lack empathy. understand something experience zero capability imagining people’s experiences. aged like Surely can’t dense? sudden spikes due massive backlog unaccounted deaths nursing homes several weeks added once. They’re 24hour counts.

And frankly guessed look graph alone. don’t go 400 deaths 1500 next day 400 organically. *needs* **federal** law mandating masks **right fucking now**. Hopefully Biden/Harris make happen.

In many ways doesn’t go far enough however, often even people wear masks wrongly. fault own. happens. reason task force specialists monitor masks worn correctly. spread communities work.

As part that, people willfully put fellow citizens danger need identified. obviously includes anybody voted Trump. people special insignia masks identified authorities sake public good.

Their children perhaps slightly less conspicuous symbol masks — something identify real risk result raised enemies society science.

As part new nationwide emphasis public health, citizens encouraged identify people “enemies” progress. identified, individuals given chance repent change ways. progress course need monitored government, third type insignia masks, ease identification.

To facilitate compliance new public health measures, new agency government created. task force mentioned easily adopted work. individuals employed federal government identified such. help gain measure trust population. jobs keep files individuals within purview, update files regularly track progress.

Obviously people willingly violate new mask law separated society — good society, well good. dealt humanely fairly. like Nazis. individuals simply separated families society moved safe place time being. perfectly humane fair. safe places seek educate evil ways harm world. re-educated returned society. course repeat offenders dealt little harshly. 

But benefit. Eventually individuals proven menace society danger security state, permanently removed. done humanely, key done good collective whole. system really space individualism. selfish attitude exactly got us trouble first place.

So selfish activity controlled aspects society, especially economic realm. Individuals allowed hoard cash. progressive tax policy course help redistributed, aid less fortunate. cash hoarding outlawed, banks reason exist. probably done away first. People run banks identified enemies state placed camps see error ways returned society. course allowed enter advantageous position, somewhere near base, reduced manual tasks help greater good. Needless say also special insignia masks identifies part dangerous class individuals.

Business owners stripes receive treatment managers banks. course understanding welcome opportunity make amends society. However will, protection, removed society.

There measures taken vis-a-vis bourgeoisie brought much pain unto country. tackled later.

**The important thing 100% fucking law leave house without wearing mask.**

Frankly require wearing even home even you’re alone. simply strictly outlawed public. Anybody caught flaunting important rule dealt harshly. Penalties enough. Imprisonment, indefinite period (at least year, five even ten years) first time offenders. exceptions, appeals. Second-time offenders sent top secret camps permanently. camps degenerates repeat violators laws. security reasons limits small group security professionals special clearance. Red Cross international organizations allowed anywhere near premises. make sure harmful individuals kept sight mind. fair, correct, proper measures taken people willfully go public without masks. terrible force young girls choose future teen mother. want abortion, right. children difficult, carefully considered. However, never forced can't afford childcare thus cannot get education. choice. free subsidized childcare underprivileged make something contribute otherwise might society. would benefit everyone. Millions middle upper class white women babies work full time, go school, finish Ph.D. Ruth Bader Ginsburg applied law schools infant. Motherhood _need_ ruin chances actually making something yourself. could fix it.

That said... kids, please avoid becoming teen parents. life hard mode, sure. child. Good, good, let hate flow you... Sure idea keeping people genocide instead encouraging rampant systemic cultural poverty within specific populations.

Both approaches problematic pretty obvious reasons. I’m North Canton area people don’t wear masks. bars friends snap pics. masks. stay home. won’t even go grocery store people don’t comply. depends define ""lockdown"". strict lockdown around country months, things started opening slowly. areas around Buenos Aires city lot daily cases. Now, virus moved cities capital starting open (recently, malls reopened many schools given greenlight start classes). city, almost everything opened (shops, bars, restaurants, outdoor activities) 100+ cases day.   Yes, agree well. ""The traditional means"" mean targeting spike. traditional methods inject purified antigen (purified protein) made lab. antigen spike (and is, think them). (Please note vaccine can, often does, use one protein target).


Not spike proteins exact same. spike causes virus bind specific receptor. specificity conferred ""shape"" spike, ""shape"" immune system make antibodies bind to. no, vaccine automatically confer immunity coronavirus, caveat there's proteins conserved ""look similar"". top head can't answer that, I'd align sequences take look, remind tomorrow will. Link? Can’t find source talking cost manner treatment.

Although I’m sure cost fortune save lifestyle choices. Also, old reason somebody shouldn’t office? thing wisdom? spare McConnell jokes, I’m specifically talking him. Dianne Feinstein 87 example across aisle. want THANK YOU! Jeezus - believe anything prevent it, allowed anything treat mystery hoax virus. Yeah, he’s alive I'm glad someone man enough change opinions, finally listen science. Better late never, mock berate people willing change. Removed mod bud trying message desantis, kemp, noem atlas want like ok Chris, like anyone listen you. Honestly, kind thing hoping another certain politician. good thing people's experiences change behaviors. Great news, impressive effort many tests processed quickly Still...he demands reopening everything? haven’t done shit point comparing countries successfully suppress virus. never went full lockdown countries did... Followed by, ""I wish would taken seriously; TLDR hoax"" featuring older guy death bed. would thunk that? think little testing place first round. we're seeing huge numbers, less deaths people hospital. also better treatment. you’ve flip flopped again. said Tylenol thing public admit redsimir. you’re jealous president got Regeneron never mention name original comment? 

Most regular people get sick wife mom kids got. mills symptoms like stuffy nose better. 32 year old CVID pneumonia Covid within 2 days showing symptoms. talking nurses Covid floor mild symptoms. asking how’s treatment working others like say they’ve seen help ton people.

But I’m sure lying bud concerts? See give fuck much subtweets Trump talk. votes shows actually care. Remember Trump shit Boris Johnson promoting herd immunity UK? brought couple times coronavirus press briefings early pandemic. USA #1 We're BACK BABY! world we're people NEARLY DIE believe science infect crapton family members believe science. intelligent person didn’t want read news COVID-19 would probably avoid reading stories COVID-19 forum. hate “regardless party position.” It’s mostly one party perpetuating shit. Say name Christie. GOP needs stop childish dragging shit longer need to. saw chart.

In image, pointed 50% picked family member. Yeah, people wear masks home, expect to.

I three friends whose entire families got it. One got dad, picked work. One got aunt, contagious asked niece come pick Bundt cake. wear masks, hey, aunt right? One get directly - entire extended family New Jersey early pandemic, lockdowns. Family members flown south weeks earlier February visit baby shower got sick. Twenty them. *Four died.*   Generally agree you, fuck Chris Christie. cynical political maneuver distance sinking ship. Fuck. Him. wont get Covid , would need alive ... ok referring Canadians getting insurance go abroad. problem takes much effort actually read papers, people take easy way out.

Like paper, instead discussing content resorted ad hominems author, posters here.

Pot, kettle. demented. reckoning Sweden nearing million deaths. Socialist Medicare thee someone family ND, one Fargo put ventilator tomorrow...MAKE MANDATORY!

Your citizens failing preventing spread this! 

Now time step lead, kowtow ""but freedom"" crap call experiential empathy. *empathizes New York* Covid fucking Dangerous? Forgeta bout it! read article linked, explains chose private clinic specializes care wants pays pocket. become massive hypocrite? Yes absolutely, looked like father reincarnate 10 years ago, he's everything against. US healthcare needs hospitals post prices, make depending level insurance.  America, fuck yeah! suspect lowering bar might goal. Source?   Bernie liberal, think even know ""liberal"" contemporary American politics.

You're pro-baby, pro-choice. Unless sister want baby family forced like pack controlling ass holes.

""Pro-choice"" includes choice *not* abortion too, genius.

And yea sometimes shit happen absolutely mean someone die, fetus mother. government involved decision making process.  Oh come on, like already know.  Yeah personally enjoy studying library, everything closed campus. really point shelling 1.2k month live school Free healthcare probably cost millions. Something average American would denied. That’s pretty much sums up. crossed burning WA off. Soon. Aye, Winter Coming. right. Everything absolute time. Nothing ever change course. shit sucks bad uneducated mindset It’s plane that’s worrisome, it’s everyone using grey tubs send stuff security, seats , etc.  also support universal health care pay massive legal costs burying normal people debt? No, thought not. almost die ICU place private room, personal relations hospital. Cain would like word... Fuck republicans. Hmm? mean rhetoric? ...as swarm ladybugs. make zero sense, sure, whatever say. Pretty disingenuous guy deleted original comment. Bud. well rate really slowed   Yeah, McConnell many things: evil, hypocritical, vaguely tortoise-like, dumb one them.

I would rather call him.... wily? perhaps? principles toilet paper ethics 17th century transatlantic ship captain, he's probably smartest person Republican administration. agree. one child back 80s almost 19. working world everything. still scared death realizing little life depended first held her. Could used years mature. Husband decided cramped style started hitting me. still wanted party. divorced mom 5 month old preemie, could tell unprepared.  easy. care happens me. engraved nameplates. go college networking parties.

Really? thought actually get education. Silly me.  Terrifying. Hey happened bad viral infection three years ago. Sucks it’s abnormal. lungs breathing passages lungs irritated, stay way cause wheezing, coughing etc. weeks months.

In case probably flu. “recovered” fine wouldn’t stop coughing six months. sucked. wasn’t 100% time made hard function normally. 

The good news body pretty good job fixing time. Trust doctors. you’re longer infected, go easy yourself, recommended exercises breathing exercises, best relax. eugenics equal access *optional* dumbass. democratic hoax? Thats told...by president... nothing do, things difficult, especially let run rampant spread every corner US. plenty countries around world handled effectively isolation/quarantine policies effective testing contact tracing. possible might never work US though around 25% population selfish morons. Hey like music still majority people blink... see reply posts without getting ""political"". commander chief last night still mask shaming downplaying effectiveness even got covid. 

I mean even know say that. answer right wing. party Trump torpedoed decent response could had, “man charge” truly petty, disgusting, disgraceful goblin human being. fact party still ardent supporters saddening disturbing. suppose won't. Public opinion would change substantially. 

But I'd expect riots case.

Especially never going away. Great Barrington Declaration proposal written signed American Institute Economic owns American Investment Services Inc., whose private fund, valued around $285 million 2020, includes holdings wide range fossil fuel companies incl. Chevron ExxonMobil, along tobacco giant Philip Morris International, Microsoft, Alphabet Inc. many others.[8] AIER statements publications consistently portray risks climate change minor large part AIER's funding comes investments, also reportedly received US$68,100 Charles Koch Foundation[8] maintains network local ""Bastiat Society"" chapters partners Atlas Network, Ayn Rand Institute, Cato Institute, State Policy Network, Charles Koch Institute Koch-funded think tanks.[5][9] ‘Maybe’ lot heavy lifting here, especially it’s becoming clear virus seems devastating long term health effects terms potential damage lungs heart. don’t know people large ‘deal fine’, completely new virus, letting people ‘deal fine’ get infected en masse may lead huge drop life expectancy next decades people deal long term consequences. 

Obviously Europe hasn’t seemed handle dealing second wave correctly yet, problem quickly widely stuff like restaurants, bars, international travel reopened despite impossible open without risk. doesn’t mean imitating US strategy would right plan, since reason aren’t dealing ‘second wave’ right first one never ended. Consider getting cloth masks made flannel wear disposable ones flannel mask. flannel baby skin. good belgian many people facebook say hang entire weekend pub support bars restaurants. 
Virologists beg people cancel plans weekend. 


Also rules implemented monday. 
Working home mandatory possible. 
Only 1 close cuddle contact (aka guckbuddy/girlfriend/boyfriend). 
Only meeting 4 persons house need 4 persons entire month. 


Of course people joke can't invite family 7, family invite me.  elected KKKumquat gutted pandemic response team make administration look like reducing costs, let crotch droppings play PR damage control. Weather models wrong time, chaotic interactions known system dynamics grow hand. Social models wrong humans react system (including model cases) actual system changes. IMHE predictions actually ""this happen"" ""this happen people change actions inserted model assumptions"". useful making real life predictions, useful making decisions - decisions change system invalidate predictions. I.P. Freely? article pure anti american propaganda.

The CDC's data proves covid-19 .1% deadlier flu. that's grossly inflated diagnosis counts. headlines like still thing? leadership. assuming failure. think response worried exactly planned put $1.5B manufacturing risk. Basically much risk produce much possible take it. 

They also substantial orders countries, adding lot manufacturing needs stack up. Nope talking anywhere else China. bad troll. write knowing huge pro CCP agenda here. Don’t care. 

Fuck existence spread virus, always, worst China. personally know 4 people COVID, 3 younger people 35 1 symptoms fully recovered within days Uncle who's 57 also recovered fully within week apparently least frequent. Since it’s delayed, looks like moderna release data time. US doesn’t get herd immunity 12+ months continuous community transmission virus isn’t contagious. know quite contagious. think go full year without getting herd immunity? realize get again, right? elected Republicans control. pretty much guarantees shitshow response things go badly. believe also 80s? Every failure starts top. Poor leadership always organization fails. infections deaths per day poor metrics. actual one pay attention load medical system. imagine lower death rate potentially virus weakening, could also improved treatment protocol. research supporting idea virus decreased severity, rather better treatments available?

More importantly, biggest difference many people infected would going seek treatment. hotspot regions hitting capacity limits hospitals, see lot secondary harm patients unrelated illness either can't go get treatment. stopped following closely months ago, notice death rate much lower given similar numbers. follow hospital load though, suspect that's bigger piece puzzle lives. Clearly didn't. Smoke weed everyday Nah, man. thousands people dead today everything right throughout pandemic someone else's careless behavior. like blaming family car killed drunk driver. really incompetent presidential administration lot stupid people across country. lack personal responsibility. end. one wants admit part problem finger pointing blaming everyone else. ever one side good side well bad. someone north dakota government official died. they? south Dakota? forget. Yes do, need live many weighs needs wearing mask grocery store people drinking partying. Dr Harold Shipman signed it, he's noted expert things cause death. Sounds legit. originally thought would data October. Yeah really exposed failure US world. I'd pissed too. Donald Trump disbanded epidemic preparedness team. threw plan created combat epidemic. Obama behind Trump racist D-bag. Safer live bondage guess. Sweden called Ättestupa. least competent person possible president? advanced maths (/s), half population never got far probably part forgot. 

You end stupid idiots think 6k cases/day weeks infected country Belgium already several times. fire expensive cost--tenured faculty? Nope.

Ahem. ADMINISTRATORS.

They primary driver tuition costs  Thank much, exciting! “stay home” messaging always targeted young people? targeted age groups age actually large dying this. Young people get called murderers party old people continuing live lives totally okay. live gerontocracy. Ageism always okay it’s young people. Trash. US ordered 100m doses Pfizer vaccine (50m courses treatment) option buy 500m more. deal sealed July price $1.95 billion.

If Pfizer potential subcontractor theirs, would rushed ramp production US beyond 100m doses? Knowing that:

* vaccine fails, get nothing

* vaccine works well others, may able sell 100m doses US

* revenue less $40 per course treatment, July sure even get much.

* market Covid vaccines soon massive oversupply everyone vaccinated

What Pfizer (rationally) manufacture ""at risk"" facilities, wait clinical trial data [going Sahin said BioNTech also talking manufacturers expand production, together Pfizer. Mr. McDermott said Pfizer could potentially free space manufacturing network boost vaccine production, also said opportunity companies help produce vaccine.

These discussions could happened months ago clear funding commitment.

I think private citizens would gladly paid much $40 ramp production capacity get vaccinated soon vaccine approved. Governments let us promised buy vaccine us instead, sadly they're buying urgency self-interested consumer would. worked temporarily, people forget COVID-19 spreads like wildfire without restrictions going back normal guarantees COVID-19 coming back area [edit- Unless live island relatively small population absolute control comes goes].

I’m decided whether lockdown better long term moderate restrictions (see standalone comment). lockdown, maintain restrictions keep cases low level.

The hope milder restrictions successful lockdown, might fit human psychology well committing set scientifically based less extreme restrictions vaccine rolled out. worst case vaccines aren’t effective  definitely sounds like may it. noticed heart rate tended calm electrolytes potassium balance. careful, much potassium stop heart obviously. Last Friday reported 5892 deaths 26 new deaths week.

About number deaths, [Swedish Palliative Care report deaths covid infection palliative care (click arrow left, select ""covid infektion"", also select period).    
As someone [pointed there's discrepancies.       
Since August, number superior SPCR stats website. instance, Platz.se total 26 deaths since 1st october, there's already 55 deaths palliative care period... way around, logically. disagree. mention it, ignore mentioning it. 

They mention **lot things** that’s thing ignoring it. 

The fact fewer cases reported today last Friday interesting me. hate guy 1.35 million die every year due car accidents. mention pollutants We’re spewing air? many millions die that? anyone suggested get rid cars? mean, it’s selfish drive car knowing could run someone kill maim time. numbers don’t lie. We’re one best though. could stay inside isolated everyone 6 months die anyway It'd way controversial. How's mom? Assuming events still happened led Japan today, wouldnt mind japanese writing. mean im still wondering english ""world"" language languages would allow one focus logic rhetoric. Capitalism, baby! totally take care flu sure, unfortunately COVID. :( circlejerk real “Don’t afraid Covid. Don’t let dominate life.”

-President Donald John Trump

This go one monumental quotes 2020. man knows lead. Trump. It’s pretty simple. America voted morons morons leading country nearly 4 years. Stop voting morons.  ""mask"" wardrobe provide protection full closure? Two words. Donald. Trump. Acknowledged, things school didn’t work me, unfortunately sometimes tough know adversity making stronger person. minor incident... collapses once, see everything, everything, changed changed completely nose.

This happened me. Floyd stuff, said something Facebook along lines ""the police violent ones"". started bunch bad vibes towards something. found friends threads implying racist, somehow.

I quit facebook. began see behind veil. internet allowed us exist isolated bubbles independent, disconnected pieces society. process loosing faith all. Healthcare control never fixed. Military control never fixed. Housing control never fixed. Wages, environment, education... planet itself. internet's greatest flaw - Allowing people choose facts.

I started believe foreign powers actively maliciously infiltrated social media directed effort create internal division. imposters pretend average American, export much culture form movies tv. could tell, without meeting person person? years, nudge people extremes. Slowly. manipulation working, rumors armed coups Trump looses.

I find similar ""anti-the-other-guy"" comments r/liberal r/conservative.  People subreddits claiming equal vigor guy obvious choice guy fouled thrown jail. blame Trump people liking Trump (or Biden), all, brain garbage-in-garbage-out machine, us strive, hard possibly can, understand side. right now, neither side knows anything side, except negative stuff. chance understanding? truly dark point.

Anyways, joined r/collapse, fucking help. Sweden listened science never shut down. still positives hardly severe cases more. One gotta love guys ❤️❤️❤️

Edited happen dismantle pandemic response measures set previous administrations.... problem run lot judges run uncontested, partially ""well know person whatever"" judges considered nonpartisan. new plan: Yes is, Andrew Jackson famously ignored Supreme Court ruling

“John Marshall made decision; let enforce FDA contradicting historical fact.

To ignore would nonsensical. thing doesnt matter. countries handled best need healthcare. tracked isolated contained. telling democrat white house dismantle pandemic amd disease infrastructure cpvid would done bad have. think mind-blowingly partisan worth conversation. telling president call hoax undermine government state response would put us here? mind. Yes, it’s maddening I'm told done Ukraine - sign high flu activity, schools, theaters, etc close. theory, carefully targeted restrictions specific areas activities enough slow reverse surge.

In reality, huge surge cases don’t time meticulously plan specific restrictions. bad leader. Trump fucked hes nation blind see yea Every country fucked deep ass . good leader. Hmmmm dont know guys. I'm pretty Trumped--I mean stumped--here. [Herd immunity recognized naturally occurring phenomenon 1930s... 

Plus, vaccine never succeed disease impervious herd immunity. vaccine, exactly alterative getting lives?   data actually protects Covid protection rate is? They'd terrible brand spankin' new pandemic level virus contagious... p*ssies Lol. Basically thing. local news (Indonesia) china’s vaccine publicly released next month. read china uses inactivated method vaccine? Whats difference viral vector method?

Can vaccinated ourself twice? One inactivated method (china) one US/UK viral vector method vaccine

Well dont really trust china’s vaccine actually, get fast country still phase 3? Smells fishy? i’m informed well? explode? Looks 1.03 right might fertilizer honestly, blue wave seems coming, might actually put America progressive train. turn shit first use. youre really making think man still test make sure patients contagious corona patients getting isolated one floor one wing completely wrong way things virus spreads asymptomatically healthy non risk people. 

But whatever. Also source July general public date? I’m pretty sure we’d waves people year goes on. December elderly, January grocery restaurant workers, March 50+ etc. dont

Nobody knows anything, including whether vaccine come us safe long term, nobody know 10, 20, 30 years line. fact “They” first sentence = EU US. 

Just clarifying since clear first. got flu shot year. First time since highschool. hurt nearly bad thought would. Totally worth avoid covid/influenza coinfection. Well Czech republic ordered bars restaurants simply shut down. Finito, Ende Schluss, GG WP. 

However wouldnt exactly comfortable go one now. year celebrate international vegan day friends going steak house shitload steaks tartare. year pass looks it. least say government simply want go point. one stat read back healthcare workers 20% infection cases. wonder now. also wonder many get get Traumatic Stress full PTSD retire early. Huh? europe lockdown. Clearly didnt work Fuck Costco! restaurant accustomed certain earnings level. Even though still limited hours, also reduces overall income. 
Sort like full-time job going part-time rate. We’re changing plans.

Cheers! I’m going need see sources “facts”. Unfortunately, even today's numbers lower last week's Friday, overall number cases/day increasing - 610/day last week. far week based four days reported data 770+/day. today's death report week 40 week 41 total 16 deaths reported far, 2/day average current week 42 already 4 deaths reported it. I've never seen people using shields, additional measure protection always used alongside masks. Great, can't guarantee that. simply cannot assume soap KILLING microbes. point stands. sucks honestly. miss going gym.  home workout same.  American approve this. don’t deserve us. sweden spared new covid wave many neighboring countries experiencing thousands new cases day? sweden differently? *satanist zionist cannibal pedophiles understand people comprehend this. cases higher right now. unlikely actual number infections are. mean is. panic overblown - people need focus healthy - economic mental devastation far worse disease - masks distancing don’t much - it’s time stop fear live - “facts” don’t add 99% survival rate - cdc even says use old way counting deaths ( changed March 2020 ) 10k Covid deaths - far less last couple pandemics lived normally flu season - wash , stay home sick - misinformation causing lot hardships dividing masses even Get ready another shut America. Epic reddit moment actually know Covid patient? know causes strokes heart attacks many people without respiratory symptoms.

Given Utah grips smaller scale surge surprise random heart attacks 50/50 chance Covid related. Well, way you’ll definitely people likely people died. survival rate 99-99.9% (depending age) seems fine one statistic, problem it’s applied tens millions deaths drastic. 

Lost healthy coworker 40s. Anothe coworker lost dad. mitigation efforts... don’t want find many I’ll know let thing run wild. think risk illegals pose, dozens Americans could killed!! state red barely Democrat, say people south Dakota seem okay doing. 

She's great job one term governor. busy campaigning Trump rather care state. FDR pretty good job it. Greatest generation all. LOL, imagine downvoting someone stating facts, can't relate. know exactly meant heard immunity doesnt mean ""let everyone get sick dont get sick anymore"" feel important make distinction. vaccine ""let everyone get sick dont get sick anymore"" get us heard immunity dont want let latter become meaning heard immunity. sure glad money could printed buy junk bonds inflate stock markets instead actually helping people. Uhhhh I’m talking cumulative fatality rate (I assume that’s CFR stands since really defining jargon). 210k deaths total. 8 million cases total. working cumulative numbers here.


Edit:And herd immunity threshold estimate, there’s nature review article Arnaud Fontanet explains estimates Sars2’s transmission rate indicate herd immunity threshold would 67% immunity. that’s case, 67 percent country would contract virus. current rate deaths (do agree? 2% cumulative cases?) would come 4.5 million total deaths. 


I’m trying make specific predictions here. I’m trying show much blood we’re talking shedding get “herd immunity.” Helps afford it. home health aide pays crap, left field Department Labor looking make worse.  competent leadership implements actual penalties non compliance - yes. real question? poor excuse leadership country. That's how. measure sweetness? r/downvotedtooblivion work inform people better options . 


"" better option take look "" comes across better "" SHIT STOP LOOKING T!"" Im saying people dont blindly follow 'scientists'. 

People trusted intuition masks went Fauci turned right. probably even saved lives!

So imagine works ways. one strictest lockdown europe. no, he's realized try bait saying ridiculous things others around Testing resources still stretched. local hospitals testing EVERYONE came one point. Broken arm? get test!

I've heard family healthcare testing suspected people, many others tested anymore testing supplies become nearly impossible get QTY, thats they've also moved pre-procedure testing days giving people whole list places get tested, load specific testing supplies specific brands test great.

Additionally, places repeat testing critical workers weekly basis. (Nursing home workers, EMT's, cops, etc) also skews number lower. Ya think assholes comply COMPETENT leadership? never said that, somone else. stand first statement replied you. even get chance see deleted messages. pm try unbiased decide deleted not. thoughts prayers. Fortunately, I'm atheist things mind. people spending time indoors + schools open + flu season = bad time Tangerine Russian Urine Man Problems fun hear ridiculous things says  Like time saw like new Rochelle bunch covid cases NYC hospitals already? somehow like corona hoard jumped nowhere prediction based upon assumptions, absolute declaration future. absurd prediction, entirely within realm realistic possibility. may end wrong, one knows either way right now. Science denial mainstream ""free speech""  OP asking alarmist question though, calm panties. OP asking since we've wearing masks part daily lives last several months, become normalized might continue going post Covid-19 future way stop transmission disease one ill? Mask wearing common large parts Asia even non pandemic times courtesy prevent infecting others one sick.

Calm down. Eat fruit something.  Putin wants chaos. US can't project force even reputation sick, dying, pissing allies destroying economy spite tariffs wrecking market US made products And, places like Canada, Australia EU data already reviewed respective regulatory bodies. 


It's still conceivable could see emergency use authorization, outside US, prior November. Phase II testing even completed, already talking distribution.

But he's peer, peer review, non-peer review totally legit. XD 
 
We're seeing really good example mental gymnastics right here. ""m saying appear enough testing resources lots people negative getting tested, patient presents complaining Covid-19, ability test possible

Unless thats meant lol Nazis may well seek authorization outside US time.

You remember trial data already reviewed Canada, Australia, EU. Pfizer could apply emergency youth authorization respective regulatory bodies weeks submit FDA. Well he'll reap sows.

Look Nancy Reagan's say drugs campaign.. Widely popular.. People still took drugs, od'ed, spread them..

Bottom line, people need take responsibility.. Many do.. Many don't..  many open windows. -- mixing CFR IFR. little evidence support notion ""it's probably going higher 80%.""

These extraordinary claims, fine -- provide extraordinary evidence, paraphrase Sagan. Tasteless Reprobate Mister Putin? It’s pandemic team ready exact event got dismantled current administration. Donald J Trump Ok America British sovereignty Nova Scotia, New Brunswick. Give us back Novs Scotia we'll leave alone. US encountered massive pandemic, requiring coordinated action sacrifice petty activities, exact time regime managed win White House believes freedom centralized authority, even face mass causalities. combined cultural distrust gathered reasoning ""the gut"", selection fantasist leader stroked ""guts"" fears rejection knowledge, combined rise Federalist Society Unnamed Stanford School 1890 (e.g. Scott Atlas), created rogue wave incompetence.

Why call negligent homicide? No, great idea. Unfortunately systemic racism police officer kneels someone's neck 8+ minutes kills recorded camera, things like happen.

So protests? No. unfortunately people get mad systemic racial social injustice. trust fund tax cheat never managed anything family business understand government works tried run government like one bigger scams. Lincoln never ignored courts. fact there’s zero precedent  It’s actually. far government programs go (Medicaid Medicare), it’s one that’s highly regulated severe penalties fraud. fact, OIG already looking Covid cases Medicare specific rules coding Covid.

# Twisted Racist Unqualified Malicious Prick simple answer: Rupert Murdoch damn shame. It’s hard keep morale shattering news feed every day. course that's exactly (GOP) branches government want. want zero restrictions businesses! mask requirements, social distance rules, restrictions bars restaurants, movie theaters etc.

And got wanted Michigan pay price. one worst acceleration covid US winter. wait see. like someone already said, republicans blame Governor hogtied submission subject! 88 years old would say fuck go casino too. that's point, guy questioned whether reopening worse shutting down, nearly everything open right country question relevant Republicans happened. State Legislators like supposed done. can't must much leader Everyone getting flu vaccine year. One issue Covid deaths counted generously flu deaths.

If 87 year old hospice diabetes dying kidney failure, got flu weeks died, nobody would listing ""flu death"".

If thing happened, coronavirus, *would* listed Covid death.

If influenza deaths counted way Covid deaths, would looking much higher influenza death counts. 10% false negative rate really true everywhere anymore. Testing methods gotten better, test quality. New Zealand better prepared. New Zealand blessed geographic isolation. Play pandemic game, easiest spot save New Zealand. close ports that's it. I'm waiting nation wide mask mandate. 

**Exclusive** talks taking place highest levels around mobilising potential Covid vaccine December, sources putting chances programme started year ’50/50′, Pulse learnt.  

Pulse learnt number sources discussions taking place NHS England, BMA groups administering vaccines first cohorts receive vaccine.

There guarantee vaccine ready December, growing optimism around possibility. One source close discussions told Pulse feeling ’50/50′.

There currently agreement going administer vaccines, including whether GPs Government told Pulse ‘use military’ needed.

The Government’s chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance said televised briefing nation [21 vaccine could become available end year, said ‘much likely’ would happen ‘in first half next year’.

However, Pulse learnt optimism around first cohorts given vaccine December.

There discussions around whether first people vaccinated care home patients staff, health care professionals, including GPs.

The Joint Committee Vaccination Immunisation [last month said living care homes staff looking top list potential Covid-19 vaccine. Healthcare social care workers would next list priorities, according updated analysis risk.

In July, Pulse reported UK Government ordered 65m syringes one manufacturer part preparations potential Covid-19 vaccine.

A Department Health Social Care spokesperson said: ‘The Government will everything needed roll successful vaccine quickly safely.

‘An enormous amount planning preparation already taken place including ensuring adequate provision, transport, PPE logistical expertise.

‘We working closely NHS use military planning logistics necessary, already gone great lengths successfully support operational efforts.’ Simple--Trump! 

He cronies dismantled pandemic response infrastructure Obama built up, refused believe science say wanted, spread disinformation, modeled execyly types things needed people avoid. cult ate up, landed here. one.

US best anything everything, long ask US. Dr. Birx said everything handled perfectly we'd expect around 200k deaths. think we've done fairly well. lived world epicenter outbreak NYC March April, disagree. guess wait healthcare system collapses understand dangerous virus community. That's far less (actual) infections given time. numbers Mar/April reflecting level truly unmitigated spread. wonder people ignoring social distancing mask guidelines? possibly president absolute idiot bemoaned virus hoax problem months people died. Trumps administration, failure national level, reinforcing negative behavior mind numbingly stupid supporters one badly written articles contradicts The pandemic playbook, passed President Barack Obama President Donald Trump, had one nation's key planning documents

Oh snap playbook? playbook, could anything possibly go wrong playbook Among serious lapses:
Money for public health cut steadily decades.

Oh problem failure follow ""playbook"" cuts going back U.S. leaders, especially president, politicized pandemic.

Wow incredible something got politicized USA 2020. Surely would happened HRC.  leaders of countries united their citizens behind idea collective sacrifice lockdowns measures

You mean like france spain?


Look, hate Trump want. Hes idiot sure. idea different president would prevented using magic ""playbook"" delusional. ""inconceivable failure""? death rate comparable many nations Latin America Europe. Considering U.S. obesity rate believe would expect higher death rate, one important risk factor RKI report number delayed:  Damn. hoped going work out.

That huge fucking mistake evidence based. people clinging anti-mask stance. (Of course leaders across world failed blame CDC directly guess.) US reacted Pearl Harbor way we’ve responded COVID-19 pandemic I’d writing Japanese. I'm Australian :) Ya like said, yalls summer super mild beautiful. outside time 6 summers would preferred eating outside wasnt almost always also smoking section.

From experience, college network real, helps lot, get lot opportunities modern social media networking events. think going Harvard top universities lot valuable even 20 years ago today. april NYC Lol never said pushups dumbass 'herd immunity' best option means nothing letting poor people small businesses die. Perfect! Herd immunity never happened without vaccine. Even possible, herd immunity takes long time happen. Take bubonic plague, example, took Europeans generations become immune-ish disease even ravaged certain communities decades initial time period know Black Death. crisis going escalate reaches apex, hits GOP homes communities excess, they’re going come crying back her. sht secured terrible leader, let's keep shit dying.

Phucka Sweden single-digit covid deaths since middle July? thx chuckle, love folks respond pure evil vivid humor! Maybe hospitals collapsing understand. Sometimes people won’t listen warnings threat large immediate ignored. 

I don’t know idea protecting healthcare workers healthcare system disappeared. think going last forever. Every pandemic end eventually. read news piece top thread? Hospitals starting overwhelmed, abd KC many places, infection rates keep growing. think gonna happen healthcare systems collapse? covid non covid patients can't get proper treatment? 0,7% deaths repeating, sure understanding it, mean shit things continue path western world. Guess realize people getting ""mild"" cases disease post-COVID syndromes neurological symptoms brain fog, numbness tingling parts bodies, plus muscular symptoms weakness, fatigue, people lung damage causing dyspnea chest pains, cardiac issues angina etc. let ""young healthy"" people get infected ""low risk""! Millions people going HEALTHCARE Republicans going take away SCOTUS nominee. Also people PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS able get healthcare. So, yeah, that's GREAT IDEA!! 

You're right, never SK. took virus seriously beginning. plan followed it. leader put healthcare people First. can't strong economy people sick jobs realized this. POTUS worried numbers-he failed testing, late stopping travel, totally bungled obtaining PPE. People continue get infected die, true, promote herd immunity cause hundreds thousands lives lost due infection aftermath. post COVID syndromes one wants entertain happen. Long-term chronic health issues debilitating. need focus too!  Dude seriously, mind fucking business. follow states guidelines gym. judgmental, know-it-all cunt social circle, one. article’s headline bit misleading (not fault, OP). Actually, it’s quite misleading. headline makes seem we’re using verbs nouns phrasing every utterance question. seems we’re adding new covid-related words, phrases abbreviations dictionary. language changes time (I assume languages do) people discover new things words fall use. That's murder either. seem hard time understanding definition terms. Attitude reflect leadership tried fight anyone bucket water. that's really do. Tell experience area outside us, dealt it. 

We know end fight Covid know many mistakes made soldier can. give go feels comfortable.

Its utterly dumbfounding seeing a* nation came together one September 11 completely implode give crisis. 

I'm volunteer firefighter spent first part year going complete hell we've named black summer fire, I've work hours reduce 2 days week seen family friends well 9 months. Yet due nation coming together actually what's needs done looking affected still better positionand less stress Americans whats supposed greatest nation Earth

Edit : spelling  Agreed, think saying US succeeded way. Individual citizens also. Jeff Bezos, richest man world American, worth 300 billion. America 600 billionaires, many multi-billionaires. millions millionaires multi-millionaires. hundreds millions people getting by, struggling make ends meet. That's problem is: huge gap overall wealth. articles relevant  Love separation powers ignored usurped one many simultaneous efforts anti-establishment folks aimed undermining systematically disassembling credible institutions. .2% anyway. multiple times higher that. thoughts contrary based fantastical notion mask distance hope virus goes away wait inside long enough.

Who's notion exactly? I've following subreddit since February, whole idea sound policy (since became clear virus contagious eradicated) that:

1) suppress virus point test-trace-isolate.

2) modify behaviour (masks, distancing) maintain 1.

3) develop vaccines treatments maintain 1 without 2.

All works towards minimising deaths. literally tho? America money fund everything hospitals testing, problem shitty leadership shitty spending. Obviously inevitable America shit ton cases death rates could quarter wasn’t shitty government. people losing jobs able feed families Weird captain denying ship sinking caused people ignore life boats US lowest score ""Public trust Government""

Man, wish even people would trusted trump said hoax.  going spam every post? I'm certain seems veins ""puffy"" sometimes makes sense. symptoms feet turned purplish red hands red. still somewhat ""covid fingers"" albeit much less severe was. cuticles still reddish. sub practically fucking worthless. Half top half-dozen posts feature words ""White House"" headline, pandemic response US ensured pandemic _always_ going political issue. moderation complete joke, existing automod rules mean lazy one.

Fuck it, I'm out. One issue analysis that, since used political purposes, usually gets numbers wrong anyway. 

For example, normally take account skyrocketing death rate try get herd immunity sort reasonable timeframe. count getting better vaccines medicine time. count fact would still immense economic hardship tanking economies out-of-control pandemic. Centers Disease Control Prevention prevent control nothing, president knowledge science got 9th grade, bad things happen. missing point. Cases absolutely rising independent testing many states. However states' **first** surge. Lol fuck off, I'll go gym ever 4 people one time anyway. flu season what's really important. least healthcare workers vaccinated early December massive help. Tremendously ridiculous unpatriotic moronic prick! American would fetish freedom. still say shutdowns cause deeper damage harm good bad businesses, heading anyway. sped process. pandemic, would shock trick. Maybe unfolds different manner, still happens. think point countries didn’t delete plan fire every single person involved making apparently punitive reasons. Highest number deaths since date. March spike nobody allowed say something negative China without getting attacked armada users worshipped CCP. don’t know comment laughing president Crap model, ""winter shit worse shit unless wear masks"" pretty much obvious point. misty eyed thinking NJPW US show late 2019. seems information Wiki old. someone ping ask updated? Oh yeah course, gotta make sure experience based would like define enjoy it. agree 100%. felt like commenter unhappy w couped wanted say deal w cuz work it’s 8hrs day. ridiculous live society President gets take total credit legislation write nowadays almost certainly even read. He's deflecting blame nursing home blunder though unfair single leadership whole saw Covid campaign opportunity instead impact would us plebs. Thrilling Reality Usurper Making Profit result testing. It’s exponential spread virus. look graphs 22 states showing dramatic increase see curve we’ve seen since worsening many states month, new COVID-19 cases jumped 18 percent week, bringing seven-day average 51,000 cases day. Though testing rose 8 percent nationally, that’s enough increase explain steep rise cases. Meanwhile, COVID-19 hospitalizations, previously creeping upward slowly, jumped 14 percent week earlier. Wrong every single level, can't prove immunity lasts long center point strategy ridiculous many reasons. can't believe mainstream American politics still 40% voting public still thinking he's right thing. know date study (the latest date shown May), here's one Stanford dated Oct 14 data study October. There's one study one state Brazil August. rest earlier. April May.

Let's assume (and big big big stretch seeing broken areas 500 deaths per million higher US falls category would put 0.57% IFR range) IFR 0.23%. would level infection needed achieve herd immunity? people simply religion wrong country, time history, wether it’s 5* hotel dungeon.

I contest that. completely case XJ though. 

They detain one religion, grows Arabian-like beard / wear burka similar reasons government identify potential risk. 

It wrong, purpose ""eliminate Uighur identity"", like ""strengthen Party control"" border region. question everyday. It’s like they’re hell bent making life suck long possible. see direct correlation high cases shutdowns, know masks keep numbers down, yet keep 50 person parties without masks feel bad infect entire family two die. Like fuckkkkk rub last two brain cells together please stop acting like children. That’d great, thanks. sure got ""1 person shortness breath thing."". issue lingering symptoms always severe. Lingering symptoms alone 1 4, severe not, enough dismiss issue rare purely anecdotal. think come conclusion 5-10 people lingering severe symptoms either symptoms overlap cases.  Even case, 1 25 people long term severe symptoms non issue. assumption depends everyone symptoms, realistic. One person could memory loss only, chest pain. misreading graph. Complacency, arrogance entitlement. I'm saying USA, country (England) western democracies general. couple beacons hope, Germany New Zealand, that, west really managed completely screw up. Lessons need learnt incompetent arseholes created respective shit shows need removed office. ever happen, failing upwards cretins always seem do!! simple: idiot president. Trump Hope useless words. Like happened New York see cases creep up? Won’t happen. expect fantasy crowd downvote. Even Fauci said BEST would April 2021. quickest vaccine occurred 5 years. ""Not anti-vaxxer, cautious"" every single anti-vaxxer says. 

[Jenny McCarthy: “We’re Anti-Vaccine Movement … We’re Pro-Safe  completely disagree best prepared. That's patently false. hate say it, types stories make feel better turns United States isn’t place earth selfish, ignorant fuck stains stealing air productive, intelligent people. cant seperate like that. Germany didnt build hospitals prepare pandemic. built part generel preparedness help support population sorts crisis. 

Basically, prepared making sure population trusts government help crisis, ready that.

When trust losing job falling ill doesnt mean life ruined, becomes lot easier follow rules recommendations meant slow pandemic.

So couldnt built fewer hospitals counted people right thing. people right thing exactly know government back.  Suggesting one ignores SCOTUS relevant discussions Germany. You’re also suggesting actions occurred Civil War applied Federal Constitutional Court clear around world, operates manner, wasn’t formed WWII. ""The common sense American people""???? fucking purple unicorns right around corner. 


The ""American people"" shown devoid common sense, prudence, empathy, compassion INTELLIGENCE.  WTF about? Ranked choice voting state elections state's ballots year. likely going need widespread state adoption ever see possibility ranked choice voting federal level - still important first step. mainly done research purposes. available people. eat lean meat lots veggies :). fast food. Ranked choice voting starting catch on.  mean, makes sense theory. think issues still exist 11pm. object permanence. ability reason beyond immediate impulses. Reminds 60-something guy saw power-waljed straight emergency exit door. stop read huge red sign even wonder - plowed it, entire building got enjoy lovely alarm sounds.

So, like that, multiplied several million. TRUMP Send lokeshn think spell disciples: T.R.U.M.P. Also natural selection occurs kills outbreeds portion society. guy basically proposing genocide solution, let weak people die call evolution. Like calm Adolf. like yearly flu? Vaccine antibodies last much longer Exactly, plus zoom splits regions further. shame quite finished, sort thing needs bbc news people see first hand certain areas trouble. Except models done pretty good job predicting things, continue citing one? guess made up. Probably sitting inside bunch strangers eating drinking spitting totally fine safe centric covid sub somewhere hopefully less comparisons actual debate discussion

I know also might hard Americans imagine, completely different countries, speaking different languages well.

If check subreddits countries themselves, veryyyyyyy likely find quite lot covid related things there, English.

The Germans write English there, neither Swedish neither Dutch theirs. seperate. 

You even got UK covid stuff UKpolitics subreddit compared here. People gave USA circlejerk Trump longtime Florida nickname 'God's waiting room' never seemed damn true - bet wait times way :-(. months y’all, it

Republican Uncouth Malicious Prick indoor restaurant dining wildly unsafe. one biggest lessons pandemic GDP isn’t everything comes fighting disease. covid first broke China many people (including myself) immediately worried poorer Asian African countries. European leaders pledged support nations virus quickly spreading undetected countries.

You’re right U.S. COULD used wealth better, don’t think scenario ever realistic. production medical equipment PPE mostly overseas can’t hire medical professionals since many people went medical school. disease outbreak also doesn’t galvanize people way war major terrorist attack would.

And time it’s become clear wealth downside making people overconfident, leads doubt widespread disease transmission country, less mask use, less investment resources money theory able buy.

And fact US’ wealth highly unequally distributed, means significant share population doesn’t access quality healthcare time often higher risk exposure virus. Many highly unequal places struggled like South Africa much Latin America. Paywall. Washing hands stop communicable diarrhea spreading? would thunk! think it’s force expresses 😂 lot people go dentist fearful sensitive pain feel drilling. bother around sort energy day.. mean 102 years old. allow leave? demand chemists Canada right now? Yeah told gets 3rd time go talk experts

Sad part always wears mask, uses sanitizer gloves. deeper that, going fifty years. looking non corporate party USA find it, voting jack shit. Mean immunity less severe disease probably something closer 12 months, we're starting see leading edge distribution since 3-24 months spread over.

Immunity severe COVID patients release ICU substantially longer -- except cases compromised immune systems. Probably minimum 12 months.

Approved vaccines produce immune reactions strong stronger patients removed ICU. Yearly booster shots required. Immunity may perfect, severe disease following vaccination going limited compromised immune systems.

Immunity also binary. sterilizing immunity may wear off, immunological memory still build up. 10 years getting vaccinations occasionally exposed real virus fighting able stop getting vaccinations without worry COVID normally worried cold viruses killing you. Kids build immunity exposure. Babies get antibodies mothers. impact virus becomes another cold virus. Indeed!  Theres argument friend, stats. could go wrong? Seizing PPE reselling highest bidder nation universal healthcare best prepared pandemic? Even then, hard communicate general public. People either latch onto lower bound projection upper bound projection. Even people thought smart can’t grasp it. problem much listening Trump shutting proposed ideas nationwide response. (And quite good! USPS wanted send 5 masks every address April, etc.)

Every country share morons, good leadership mostly cancel out, least minimize impact. Instead, village idiot directly opposing top epidemiologists. :( “could be” means probably not. agree point others making uncounted infections likely affecting denominator, also thing consider really became widespread, find immunity lasts only, say, 12 months - could ticket losing 500K people year foreseeable future.

Also, even 8M die, even 1:1 ratio long haulers people die, even 5M infected, 10M people either die disabled this, really nasty world great healthcare options unemployed. realize science partisan issue Well course. always got say disingenuous bullshit comment make think covering ass. said help bench, WRONG DICKMILK John Ionaddis investigated Stanford political bias due shoddy work study. easy.... inept ignorant people charge making decisions. $1 billion slashed CDC budget 700 unfilled positions.

Well president base suffering hard anti-intellectualism. shame That’s fair. drunk, careless, people standing close bars sidewalks (remember: Europeans love go outside cigarette stay close little groups) respecting social distancing, sharing drinks, sharing cigarettes, sharing ~substances~ US Labor Day infections spreading = exponential growth. I'm Chicago suburbs yet see person store without mask. wearing nose stores really strict masks culture definite factor, explain everything.

Conspiracy theories run Facebook that’s how. till see state graphs, shape obvious.

this either prove disprove OP, tell Well bunch idiots elected demented science denying creep. there's that. would differently? Michigan look across lake Wisconsin. Republican legislature done nothing combat coronavirus third highest infection rate world. Michigan’s future nothing True, numbers rising again, we’re hitting record near record highs new cases per day, cooler weather drive people events back indoors increase risk spread, cold flu season ramp exacerbate situation. Red panties night baby! Nowadays everybody wanna talk like covid's gone away

Like nothing comes move lips, little extra spit

Motherfuckers act like forgot covid vote people stripped away social safety nets? Maybe let's election. Let rephrase original comment. consequences denying science. federal reserve keep pumping money economy fix it. Money ephemeral anyway, it’s based tangible resources. 2008 taught us doesn’t ever kinds issues. They’ll release stimulus packages keep everything going. Ivermectin odd choice. It’s anti-parasitic agent never used anti-viral previously far know. Bangladesh consider using Ivermectin COVID-19 treatment? Doxycycline antibacterial/anti-parasitic agent.  Well, here's hoping that. long Trump-o touch it. Yup. EU surpassed US new cases yesterday. 

It worth noting two populous countries world reporting accurate numbers. China outright lying, India (among massive issues) counting people tested positive covid dying. guys hoping praying hard enough vaccine? I’m sure vaccine come faster vaccine SARS 2004. Sitting waiting vaccine doesn’t exist worst plan ever. Hope isn’t effective tactic. 

Small business owners getting screwed left right, 9-5 crowd works home parrots mask wearing save all. 

Rates declining flat major mask mandates, even masks prevalent yet infections increasing. masks aren’t effective? No, must people aren’t covering noses, even don’t show symptoms. must asymptomatic. False: That’s people don’t seem grasp— already lost virus. war public opinion enough selfish fuckwits country guarantee regardless happens Nov., we’re taking “herd immunity” route. vaccine help speed process given trying reduce spread infection tracked traced. half population get vaccinated. 

This going us much longer people led believe. way europe numbers; nobody prepared promoting delusion getting really old. TRUMP ignorant followers blurring reality. Easy answer. says U.S. could start distributing coronavirus vaccine October, contradicting CDC's timeline**  reluctant blindly trust FDA point. Anti-science Christian conservatives. Yeah, Hathorne said thankful alive, thankful family hospital staff helped pull through.

Love top comments make worst assumptions people easy show they're wrong. Smart people made plan accounted dumb people able follow plan. account dumb people put charge executing plan itself. think something. FHM clearly choose divide responsibility several type entities. Government agencys, companies civilians. Maybe idea people would get overwhelmed much responsibility?

For public basically: stay home slightest symtoms, keep physical distance (but emotional closeness - ""stick together stay apart""), wash youre hands.

For companies totally different kind responsibilities etc  necessarily expected earlier, along Pfizer told us know vaccine effective October.

Now, seems certain political phenomenon play U.S. non-factor countries. Pfizer already submitted data review, comes in, Canada, Australia EU. conceivable emergency authorization request could submitted countries prior November, however given new guidelines put place FDA possible U.S. plan, trained staff CVS Walgreens deliver vaccines nursing home administer shots. Assisted-living facilities residential group homes also participate voluntary program. Nursing home staffers vaccinated too, already received shots.... Vaccines way nursing homes within 24 48 hours FDA approves use, Mango said. could someone found time portal february also anarchy libertarianism work: people fucking stupid. sat balls, America. oh worse that. killed million them. 

covid doesnt kill influenza, deadly health professionals experimenting works. solid treatment options now, suspect crippled covid fewer well. 

I think really cusp lockdown cure worse disease.  way enforcing people forego holiday get togethers either.  Youve got backwards. Places think indefinitely suppress virus country ~1-in-6 people exposed/infected ones trying ""dictate terms"" virus. South's learning live it. Italy registered 10,010 new coronavirus infections past 24 hours, health ministry said Friday, highest daily tally since start country’s outbreak previous record 8,804 posted Thursday. never heard vaccine coming Election Day. on, sir?  LOL. Michigan doesnt state legislators.

They obstructionists Komrades. GOP subversive anti-american terrorist org. i'm hoping masking winter cold/flu season thing offices. Many colleagues 30/40-something parents always seem bringing whatever bugs kids get school. They're sneezing hacking away work culture applauds toughing out. thought diverting ambulances actually kind normal thing hospitals do? already forgetting promising that?

Hilarious. plan trump  Sympathy Australia. thinking today grateful fire season pretty quiet compared hellish last one. constant smoke evacuations would terrible Covid. ethanol isopropyl

no difference assuming stay wet 15+ seconds, issue 90%+ isopropyls guess that. double sided tape thing. Fuck. I’ll bloody either way. Mask/goggles/hardhat/earpro already rubbing raw put Republicans charge failed usual except time used mask give trillions away billionaires, banks, corporations instead like last time used national crisis start war kill million plus humans enrich billionaires, banks, oil biz, defense contractors, corporations. Election day vaccine? Lol! Please pass smoking, bro. know FiL? I'm India. access tests classic symptoms surprised am/was infected. weird chest pressure/high heart rate prominent blue veins nowhere. Dunno go doctors bc healthcare pretty pathetic wanna get exposed another strain. built legislation running company, expect failure every turn. Traitorous Random Unpredictable Malicious Phenomenon. vaccine safe FDA says it’s safe. Let's ignore fact Wednesday Thursday saw highest number new cases since June. doubt want reminded.

Those promising election day vaccine already track proving gullibility. Tyrannical Racist Ugly Mothefucker + Pence MI state legislatures' Republican majority leaders also promoting idea herd immunity, likely agree president expendables: ""...people already sick."" great argument wellness; get caught sick Republicans power. ""Lorem ipsum"" strong word... Florida newspaper. That’s biggest bunch bullshit I'm sure point trying make. Decisions March based knowledge accumulated March. huge learning curve Summer solutions tested either made situation better worse. Today everyone benefit making decisions vastly knowledge.

Where getting from? making up? tried tested already? New Zealand though. came back soon ended lockdown We'll remind you, right... Yeah, looking good. Mullen fire claimed several dozen buildings creeping closer towards local ski hill. Two days ago, read firefighters struggling 75 mph winds could monitor it...although Wyoming suppose get little snow weekend, hopefully helps.

My coworker also worried cabin near Steamboat, think threat nearly imminent there.  She’s hell job. It’s crazy someone tires help citizens vehemently, gets written off.

0.05% IFR people 70. Apparently elections matter sounds like fun, too. workplace, I've couple customers say things like ""it's flu"" ""it's overblown."" keep mouth shut, staring without saying word keep trying blather almost thing beauty. like see embarrassment start creep corner they've painted in. America like human centipede power reason death rate dropped every country. number new cases high initial outbreak number deaths much lower.

The simple answer - doctors learned hell lot virus behaves developed much effective treatments.

That's delaying infection long possible initial outbreak novel virus saves lives - greater percentage cases result death doctors know little disease.

That's Swedish ""strategy"" stupid. strong, trusted political leadership. US hasn’t years.

Our leadership literally dismantled pandemic preparations place prepare outbreak. I'm sure New New Zealand somewhere states. basically playing Russian roulette. healthy 30 even get corona side effects worse bad cold. long isolate get TESTED 5 days party (you need time virus incubate &amp; build detectable levels), participating high-risk gathering impact community live. But, need go back office within 5 days placing everyone around greater risk. asymptomatic unknowingly sickening others. LETS LOOK TREASURE!!!!! One word: greed Ok, what’s biggest reason do? didnt😂 Isn’t Europe 100k/day levels now?

Like, get internet usually attack America bit much “look failed succeeded” routine. Deaths lagging indicator. fish rots head down

We know *why*. know ~30% country seems *like* it. expect world live like 60% vaccinated? disease average age death higher average death itself? Nah dude. pandemic ends vaccinating risk old people part. Covid near point indirect problems caused outweigh actual problem itself. there’s news them....?  dumbass know vaccines take years develop.

Which makes one us. rhetorical question, right? mean know how.  Oh yea youre right! arguing letting burn healthy population. you.

Not quite. Here's thing, 20 y/o stud living 80 y/o grandma, get play. 

It seem risk stratification wrongthink, that's sure. Terrible Response Mounting Pressure yeah, bad. 

i'd seen one mathematician twitter used info taking testing rates, percentages, cases calculate likely per capita total cases (including missed) done much lately.

do know anywhere that's talking peak per capita ""wave"" length time state certain per capita rate calm down? proved wrong. Oops. almost like dont die second get it. mean ""the media"". Media european countries literally report europes cases countries break records die?

Date death date report different things. I’d hazard guess less developed nations also reporting keeping track due lack infrastructure. mean think dude. reality getting point threat covid &lt; problems covid indirectly causing Say likely live 4 years, throw 25% time left earth away hiding home alone remove 5% chance dying? No. really hate people consider risks *themselves* virus. easy come wrong conclusion need behave responsibly.

The big thing standing way US dealing properly everyone trained ignore responsibility society. people behaving safely determine many die, people transmitting disease. Nobody thinking scared themselves. thinking responsibility next guy chain keeping disease transmitting country killing people. integrated anarchist philosophy core libertarianism think world causing us miss something simple basic responsibility endanger everyone around us.  literally going isolation days, get tested days waiting results see 9 month old nephew. sister husband spread BIL father high risk. Aw keep acting tough Internet we’re proud u💯  Donald Trump  going go get it, smart guy? everyone going travel vaccine factory?

Or, hear now, partner distribution several existing companies locations every neighborhood America easily accessible already administrator hundred millions vaccines every year? Adjusted population Wisconsin’s numbers really bad. Yeah, one cares. AIER mouthpiece Koch family Kato Institute. think care all, know else say.

Judging history, actually conversation all. sound lame. Spend time around sub you’ll learn vaccines take long going faster usual lol That's takeaway?? Jfc Nah can't trust Gates, since wants microchip you. feel like I've aged decade *really really* quickly Yep - sabotage opposition means necessary, whether treason letting countless Americans die Nebraska 8percent beds use. TOTAL! sicknesses. Stop spreading lies. wasn’t! remember hearing nurses America reached/spread across USA hours cut due less people using private hospitals minor things due fear virus. preparing unilaterally &amp; sending staff home. turns thoughts prayers effective originally believed. It’s straightforward answer... Donald Trump. American exceptionalism rears ugly head again! know. People Reddit took COVID seriously beginning (like btw) still traumatized ""it's flu"" crowd still present early days downvote everything slightly points COVID maybe quite horrible people think. said 4/4 cases know personally develop long covid, would happen all. Ahh...understood. Thank you. aspects response , opinion, responsible effects noted article? office phishing training exercises every get SUPER obvious scam emails created department you’re supposed click button “reporting” suspicious get BS congratulatory certificate idiot. used wonder idiots fall shit...I don’t wonder anymore. I'm sure team runs country like business. 

I'm sorry, dumbest thing I've ever read.  laid detailed plan visiting family, stepmother, private Facebook post. welcome anytime. sneezing coughing wash hands upon entry. Love refuses get it. 

Sorry, what's problem here? region case numbers high even supposed visit family?  current one kills thousand people day? country ability anything it? one worlds highest fatality rates, mean #15, lower many countries lockdowns, sure.

It’s funny vilified Sweden’s approach was, one ever wants point Bolivia, [who one toughest lockdowns actually death per capita think Sweden has.  Germans tryed exactly didnt work either.

Not really. regions symptoms contact confirmed positive case get tested. symptoms risk region. often took several days get test results contacts confirmed cases always quarantine. Active Measures, comrade yet peak corona deaths back April. 👍 could easily still shut governor state cared constituents. 

You don’t seem understand could easily addressed instead depending random people right thing. 

Speaks loudly regard level intelligence. Propaganda. US amazing facing. I’ve never seen government mobilize private public companies together fast strategically move across country state state, working state’s provide support needed. impressive say least. nobody ever said massive parties either. are. group scientists saying risk opening economy greater risk locking down. group legitimate ones.  Hmmm wonder... 🤔🤔🤔 That’s Reddit seems pure anti American subs, hard read comments. regular sane people comments get voted buried. first icu beds per capita It’s easy say haven’t could looming fall winter currently shaping up. perspective might significantly different then. Eh, stupidly common (Australia) denatured form, generally 95% ethanol 5% methanol... pretty much every supermarket sells it. 

(not use methanol containing versions toxic, readily available) google it. Doesn’t bother don’t believe me. Stats reveal soon enough know look for.

This account interesting too. OP tested positive antibodies days prior reinfection. don’t think researchers recording cases first icu beds per capita area chin mask capital ohio unfortunately surprising  Ok comment contradicts situation where? said personal circle 4/4 people develop long covid, say would happen all. Actually pushback debate good, that's back science. theory theory gets tested, different theory comes different tests need debates. dismiss people like pretty sad. seems like science works belief. nobody's advocating massive crowds, different approach. hard understand. understand censorship media now. one thing Reddit use stand against. 60 million infected swine flu, we're lucky deadly covid. point guess it’ll you, won’t much restriction anymore. Well, would hope condescended article doctors understand timing issue rely much wrong situation. royal family able evade pandemic hotzones like home country. fan destruction failure, definitely keep going Let ask...since *always* viruses circulating (asymptomatically symptomatically) kill thousands people per million *every* year....why bars *ever* open? covid reddid netherlands, im guessing eu nations aswell I’d taking business elsewhere. hit morons pocketbook get understand. Increase visibility active suppression information related Chinas responsibility another global pandemic. Fuck lying dangerous China! Awuful president Yeah lol, I’ll tell European case posts don’t get lot traction. goes common Reddit hive mind circle jerk Europe utopia US retarded. still able breathe easily wearing n95 mask? I've done tests (like trying blow match closet) works cases. I've store office, feel like breathe easily it. supposed feel way? Donald trump? Decades Fox News creating millions paranoid idiots. Third, presidents (not Trump) value unity

holy fuck lmao America might think prepared anything, even casual glance healthcare system would disabuse idea, even significant population ""you can't make me!"" assholes. wear masks distance long want, becomes problem encroach upon personal decision making. still 1.5 weeks restrictions hopefully reduce infections. People arrogant, thinking would never reach shores simply cold. medical knowledge tech world can't save US itself. know. Here, conundrum. I'll tackle one right upstairs Lets cover world bubble wrap someone might fall. unless ""sell stocks"" plan fucking plan. headline seems designed attention blatantly wrong Slow motion survival fittest. Ima steal dat thing science look data results study solid. GOP Trump  No, idea lock got contact tracing supplies blighted areas slowly open rate infection low enough simply wearing mask would sufficient someone caught covid decent chance knowing person likely gave it.

Just like nations did. South Korea got first case time US, decent population us even super spreader event beginning yet lives different. Wah wah can't go bar save millions people's lives tour St Augustine back talking basic knowledge hygiene avoid infection deciding factor wars fought 1500s.

So long we're dragging morality back dark ages, guess thought drag medical knowledge back far well. clearly doctor expert subject people still parrot saying, advocating embracing even larger scale death rate hospitals currently cannot handle, without proof reinfection make point moot.  True, city Saskatoon (twice population comparable density city) 4 cases day question. They've managed keep lock community spread, lost cause here. same. Wish gf thought same....You know - Friday night gotta go eat restaurant..... scared flu stayed home!!! Information safety privacy poor China. tech giants may use database manage relavent data safely. civil servants still using excel copy paste process contract tracing data. (I helped process data effectively know using outdated excel.) Many data leaked people involved wants sell them. know case believe many data sold. Yes. that's problem. Doesnt look day 99 inaction. 

So starve death, murder? Got it... know people definitely do.

the death rate probably hit new records 10 days thanks giving.

I bet time india even control america shoot ahead again. seems like everyone missing point suggestions. want big family thanksgiving go it...just don’t guilt family members attending. It’s people’s individual comfort level. Also highest bidder. think commenters like one replied to, lured often righ-leaning, international media thinking Sweden succeeds despite locking down. Simply tool argue lockdowns harsh restrictions example US. much misinformation Sweden sub international media. IFR likely using specific term ""infection fatality rate"" deals deaths/total infections. notice avoided term even though become pretty standard parlance discussing deadly virus is, infected  Thats cool me. dont care Thangsgiving sad little know talking yet speak like sort genius sitting leather armchair lecturing excited students. endpoint virus (along simple natural selection)

Like possibly say something fucking *stupid* think smart whatever current rate is, keep death rate low people get care. beds available hospital get much higher percentages. prefer Zeus, personally. one makes laugh popular argument while...until southern/midwestern states started increasing much. order someone use increase size conspiracy. Well, something something done often leads useless measures cause fatigue medium term know sarcasm dang fool moment there. board circle-jerk people want feel superior folks want spend next two years locked inside. proposal isn’t proper lockdown, they’re telling people socialise outside people live shutting e.g. workplaces, restaurants, schools etc staying open. government isn’t providing level funding people first time, local politicians refusing implement rules unless fav quote ""The IMPORTANT Video Ever ""Nature going choose right hand list anything.""

(before asked ebola disaster look many people infected resulting many health care workers infected due training wrong equipment deal it) say that. However context relevant, leaving out. said march year reason (like preventing shortage medical personnel).

You read takes dedication anti-mask wearing carnage taken place watch.

It's almost like doubling default strategy. lot, back march though ventilation must, last result better avoided, cause giving oxygen better.
back 0 drugs, several ones every degree severity Well president declared immune know. 
Isn't enough? /s lol US best prepared country? Nice bait opinion article. Asian countries always dealing pandemics. much better procedures contact tracing place. doesn’t stop... ridiculousness thank glorious God, never mind logic God caused virus. Never mind though. Please feel free elaborate 0,6 sole objection desire force me. way guarantees you’ll leave (and others don’t want it) alone, hell, I’ll even donate cause. :) let celebrity apprentice guy run show? lot times doctors look things, extensively. numbers keep coming good. 

As someone wide range somatic anxiety symptoms, would amazed make feel constant basis. current fatality rate overall roughly 3.8 4% US. that's take account possibility hospitals getting overloaded resources strained.you're massive problem one third people infected even old existence symptoms suffering debilitating effects possibly permanent 6 months infection including heart liver digestive problems.  answer honestly.

Let’s say there’s 50% effective vaccine - yes young people still contract virus.

Do socially distance forever order prevent illness? relatively low risk illness. so, haven’t infectious diseases? accepting preventable deaths via socially distancing every flu season Granted, city vs province Saskatchewan different population density. problem. think likely get one, party effective like flu vaccine. 

At point debate becomes: social distance forever slightly extend lives tail cost living miserable, isolated lives? Pfizer absolutely point transparency. big points letter.

1. know whether vaccine effective end month. 
2. expected, wait safety milestone reached November apply EUA.
3. already preparing manufacturing data ready end month. So, expect they'll hit ground running. post removed cannot verify reliable source. Twitter sources may reliable. possible, please re-submit link reliable source (i.e. news article).

Yup, they're likely youngish families, kids school. Schools reopened 3 weeks ago, cases explode. Also offices, restaurants, approaching Spring peak, shutdown imminent. Head CDC Trump appointee. Years developing ""perfecting"" for-profit healthcare system.

Years cultivating anti-science among significant swaths population.

Years ""Them - Us"" thinking comes pandemics (that's something happens Africa China, here).

All brought together administration least prepared, willing, able take steps necessary actually combat thing. eating indoors causes spread, food prep. remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir interferon definitely getting negative points this? People oppose making sense! Yep, came say -- better worse, people UK wear masks outdoors. would far bigger statement worn one think. sacrifice save 0.2% something simple, like world go without ice cream years, would fine. problem saving 0.2% involves hard lockdowns increase domestic violence, suicides, childrens educations, causes job losses etc.. impression Merrillville Highland Rona stopped border.

Not perfect, better That's 13 million dead.....what cunt. 

You really dense chicken McNugget. normal McNugget I'm talking really deformed ones make 2 year olds cry try feed them. also account culture. Americans raised independent personally responsible. kind unique world still. pandemic came, individual (and still is) approach it, hence anti mask protests. what's big meeting I've heard October 22nd for? sound like vaccines seeking authorization then. Obama tried increase funding potential pandemic blocked Republicans mean publicly available information, never going reach masses oct, initially given doctors such. realistically available masses dec. twat? :S Thankfully, healthcare free come from. Good luck muricans leadership. Culture too. democrat power, doubt people think it’s hoax would singing different tune. Extreme individualism culturally accepted selfishness, deference parties show big business, American exceptionalism xenophobia (it happened they’re advanced us, don’t worry fineeee), lack social safety nets would allow people stay home need would established mechanism emergency aid, poor labor rights allows companies force workers unsafe conditions easily violate unenforced safety laws coronavirus related emergency orders, doctor shortages rural areas - contributed lack preparedness.

This even get obscene healthcare system resulted 

- high at-risk population,

- “efficient” (limited surge capacity) hospitals, 

- private insurance many people cannot afford use even have, 

- ridiculous hospital bills encourage people ignore symptoms, 

- commonly horrific conditions eldercare institutions, 

- bad hospital access poorer hospital quality poorest areas filled people likely contract public transportation essential work, 

- guaranteed sick leave, locally available limited.

All direct effects also contributed culture working sickness toughing out.

Instead got one actively made worse. it’s like would like Vietnam New Zealand we’d Obama president. every man culture, systems outcomes prove it. thing tho got bloodwork pretty funky dropping white blood cells around time liver alt w/e climbing

but recent test everything back normal really cant figure whats wrong ask covid anti body test sure Allegheny county bars restaurants traced back less 10% traced cases, made less 10% total cases. 90% 'community spread', meaning know got it. we're talking cancelling indoor family dinners I'd say safe say eating restaurant indoors considerably less safe, really common sense knowing know restaurant strangers without masks eating drinking would risky. cdc example considers moderate high risk there's plenty articles 'gauge risk' like one comment says, I'm opinion dancing around economy would collapse even worse least butts seats  thing happened workplace right vacation. think even many Swedes think FHM say pressconferences, back spring bunch restrictions recommendations seemed come company, know several others got exact info companies day. realistic assumption. first many. party productive?

Another big problem public transportation overwhelmed there's distance bus, metro trains.

Milan alone yesterday 1000 positives. america, people willingly decided they'd rather roll dice virus go core values military solder people homes like communist china Europe. time get it. like 90% producing antibodies, those, 10-20% low levels?

The early-stage vaccine trials showed much homogenous reactions.
Looks bit like virus disturbing process adaptive immune system infections. Trying achieve herd immunity means getting 80%+ US population infected virus. Sars2 virus 7% lethality rate (conservative completely ignores potent sublethal effects), we’re talking 16+ million deaths.

Yeah thoughts were, also people go bars prior 11pm Treasonous Red Underlings Mocking Progress Donald. Trump. follow plans place schools would opened 4-12 weeks. Would like go back science based plans Obama administration? open schools generally open societies. endless closures, especially schools, science based slightest. Pure fear virtue signaling.

Yup. used post office send every American household pack masks every week, non-contact thermometer start required mask wearing symptom checks right start, would done deal.

POTUS Hilary election, like have, pandemic would much better contained USA. really. great life based actual fantasy. states create angst anxiety. failure engineered. Military government. I'm exactly sure Trump (and GOP) thinks great idea hospitals run, corpses piling up, election?

My tinfoil hat side wonders voter suppression, making people take virus seriously want risk going polls crisis level outbreak GOP supporters go mask less twinkle covid infected eyes. can’t believe asinine position telling ppl go restaurants. understand economic devastation would cause 1 went restaurant natural herd immunity right now. else constant continuous community transmission? may want it, happening. 

So much strategy similar war drugs. Drugs bad kill people, let’s put giant walls, put people jail, hunt helicopters. Turns people still drugs, drugs still kill people, war drugs makes much worse. strategies you’re recommending make much worse forcing disease older populations creating second order effects mental health, cancer screening, starvation developing countries, lack education needy etc. Germany it’s .5% infections that’s source I’ve seen. Republicans see functional government enemy though. may hint explanation.   Damn that's sucky way live. chose Hope. reasons think nighttime curfew good idea:

- People go 11pm 6am mainly socialize, party, dance, drink bars, high risk acivities. winter, activities take place mostly inside, especially northern city like Berlin.
 
- aforementioned activities allow social distancing, main point close people.
- people agree activities necessary, avoid partying situation better.

- measure disrupts limited amount people, mostly young, many sleep 11pm 6am. daily life vast majority people affected this.

Now, think comment bit tongue cheek, ""we lock always, night"". wasn't, many along lines are. point total lockdown incredibly disrupting, forcing people lockdown time recreational unnecessary activities still high risk take place seem unreasonable measure still could efficacy. France actually gradually tightening restrictions summer long response increasing cases new clusters.

In late July, height vacationing, mask use made mandatory shops, response increased infections.

In August, masks made mandatory office, response increased infections.

The second wave already started August. effective solution CA doing.

But close everything? once, premeditated date?  n Flu, killed 1 4 million Hong Kong Flu 1968-1970 killed 1 4 million worldwide.

Without going back dig sources information memorize numbers. look back asian flu figure seemed wrong. CDC says estimated 1.1M. (other sources says 1M...)

On another note, ballpark ranges 1-4M seems like huge range although believe figures there... One assume range Sars-Cov2 1.1 low end spectrum. might best limit comparison low-end approximation. 

But hey, 2 cents nowhere near Epidemiologist Historian. guy interest matter. (not something would recommend trying breaking ice pick someone with) people assume support Trump question Fauci. guys made assumptions, don’t get mad hold mirror behavior. add mask wardrobe winter/flu months. Republicans. Same, I'm dreading winter also lot planned. Government Well one advantage instead traveling overseas (something Australians love to) Australians might willing travel locally spend money here. Also, worry covid means open internally far could international borders open.

But yes, certain areas economy suffering. fact economy general is. However economy also suffering Europe, North America snd everywhere else. best prepared.  I'd say among vulnerable. many massive strikes them:

\-No political ability pay people stay home length time.

\-Huge, diverse, political polarized country would mass opposition attempts mitigate spread COVID.  practical ability enforce guidelines way federal/state system setup, due size country.

\-Resistance distrust sides political spectrum type tracing techniques utilized places like South Korea (tracking credit card transactions, surveillance videos, etc.

\-A massive world-based economy churn matter government stop it.

\-50 relatively independent governments enjoy constitutional protections strong public support much federal intervention. 

It's pretty obvious types countries would better type situation. helps smaller, less politically divisive, bigger social safety nets, large government people accept regulating lives micro level, reliant tourism, etc. I'm NYC lots social programs city state going bankrupt less tax revenue people fleeing. social safety nets paid monopoly money necessarily tests ordered doctors. majority tests done right drive thru tests based individual requests based self-observed symptoms. contract tracing exposure related tests symptoms.  mention test 10% false negative rate.  sounds like bunch nonsense, honest. sides here; one side claiming great (obviously bullshit), side claiming horribly could done much better *they* charge (obviously bullshit). 

How exactly ""prepared"" confront pandemic all, let alone ""best"" prepared?  even ""confront"" pandemic? 

If someone wants argue *should* taken extreme measures; curfews, separating people force example, mass arresting protestors, say it.  short that, nothing would different.

But course nobody saying that. nobody would done nothing would different.

Stuff like typical election year garbage. flat agree that. everyone involved strictly quarantines 14 days (groceries delivered, leaving house reason), decided also get covid tested negative meeting, see situation would considered unsafe. absolute scale, would safer stay home? course. Would people actually take precautions describing above? would not. would argue did, small family gatherings would safe. What? knew masks help prevent spread disease? Magic say!  project lot people area care - unless happens them. still might care. give health insurance Winnipeg Jets games TV would happy. 95% probably right. get herd immunity would need reach around 70%,” said Sir Robert Lechler, president Academy Medical trying quiet possible, pumped Christie full whatever could save him. 

Every day hospitalization, googled it, one ever said 1 thing, beginning, “that good spirits receiving good care.” one talking huge conservative player, huge risk category hospitalized 7 days???

They wanted completely hushed opinion, unless Christie died could quietly leave hospital could continue “covid friend haven’t met yet” bullshit. 

Because opinion, give Christie lot credit speaking out, even flaming Trump directly, he’s risking lot going directly him. almost certain told keep mouth shut. 

Sadly, “his people” probably won’t hear him. ways keep certain classes down.

That implies communities aware contraceptives.  black plague outbreaks 300 years first pandemic. hell happened EU? looked like things winding boom spiking over. happened?

One thing consider access treatments there, disparity access level health care across nation. Also many hospitals hit capacity capacity ton people died even getting access level hospital care. Another issue many people uninsured underinsured pocket costs essentially death sentence family would sooner stay home sick hope get well without care.

So treatments Trump got technically available others others taken them, access level quality health care major issue. Trump: fired afraid covid. ""There point life can't deadlift"" name quote I'll suck dick  guy survive?

Governments responded restricting human movement, reduced economic activity. changes may benefit biodiversity conservation ways, Africa, contend net conservation impacts COVID-19 strongly negative. Here, describe crisis creates perfect storm reduced funding, restrictions operations conservation agencies, elevated human threats nature. identify immediate steps necessary address challenges support ongoing conservation efforts. highlight systemic flaws contemporary conservation identify opportunities restructure greater resilience. Finally, emphasize critical importance conserving habitat regulating unsafe wildlife trade practices reduce risk future pandemics. believe referring reported first treatment given Trump widely available. Top 11 Anime Redemption Arcs  Oh come someday. Probably dangerous now. political comments still rule virus 100% political multiple countries, including United States? It’s almost Americans prime candidate disease impacts less healthy. countries obese, diabetic, heart disease prone, supposed shocked virus kicks ass countries? main thing got unique monoclonal antibodies. one handful people get them. got golf buddies CEO company makes them. people think hypocritical tested stem cell research. rate, it’s experimental measure got compassionate use waiver. 

Remdesivir isn’t magic bullet. It’s expensive treatment doesn’t impact mortality. Oh, that's messed up. feel bad sister.

I know departments, everyone mine return work May, actually know anyone else might still out. Well, except temps.   70 percent people got COVID-19 mask! /s “Daughter, mistress. What’s difference?” Plasma antibodies used long time, that's Trump Christie got, got regeneron Eli Lilly monoclonal antibodies (I think one got one got other). Plasma antibodies helped much studies. studies monoclonal antibodies done, nowhere near done. think Trump got tested hundred people.

As far remdesivir, I'm glad things improved point give patients still reserve people badly enough need go hospital. Trump claimed badly got others would have.

And go testing, access testing get results quicker. covid earlier know, earlier treat, better.

Hope get well. Lmao would 2/3 Americans instead 1/1500 right obviously right wing politics, business owners right survive, guidelines follow also staying afloat. government going bailout small businesses like corporations, can't blame people survive, covid not. Bankruptcy ain't hiccup.  Yeah right [Maybe Colds flu long term effects, does. states well.

For now. always problem. Surges spread out. Apparently know shit get covid. Congrats get better. getting treatment Trump got stfu.

""Before hospitalized Friday, Trump received Regeneron's experimental antibody therapy -- may reduce levels coronavirus shown promising results trial involving 275 patients.

But treatment yet received emergency use authorization Food Drug Administration. Biotech company Regeneron said provided drug receiving ""compassionate use"" request Trump's doctors.

For people, ""getting access not-yet-approved drugs compassionate use request long challenging process,"" Mayo Clinic said, listing series requirements patients would need meet.
But Trump received therapeutic Friday, one day tested positive Covid-19, according White House press secretary Trump's doctor."" political comments still rule virus 100% political multiple countries, including United States?  Lmfao Indeed. solution, like always was, implement emergency universal basic income period time virus control.

It would served dual purpose preventing majority deaths also data point UBI works scale. I’ve twice, loved Hyde Park lot went. also loved St. Paul’s cathedral. There’s little abbey near still shrapnel pockmarks Blitz WWII. museums cool. Definitely go see show West End. sure you’ve ever used metro NYC, underground London soooo much nicer. Take day trip Oxford get chance. weekend trip Edinburgh train. Scotland incredible. must mean totally fine! mean, whole *month.*  might want change numbers bit... 



Just FYI. 7 days ICU seemed trick.  Hooray Beer! Republicans change mind issues impacts Also this: article, close family member receive treatment. Parts heart permanently die and/or turn scar tissue heart attack. harvest stem cells person, grow huge number lab, inject back dead heart tissue stems cells take place dead tissue become new heart cells. Absolutely life changing revolutionary procedure. sentiment. 

I know everybody, think people truly assholes ignorant. But, would wager way read people's minds, would fairly substantial portion might want take couple zeros that. googeling, seems corona virus share ""proofreading"" - explains nobody talking it. Thus taking numbers corona variants still give us decent hint better data. (It jump species barrier, proof-reading perfect.) already said, pessimistic data looks good, optimistic data look better. agree last paragraph, listed either partially completely false. don’t need change facts make point know.  Republican response time literally measure calendar added several zeroes, friend! Yeah! Eat dust, rest world!
Lol Curve flattening talk election day. pretend everything trending right direction regardless realities ground.

as Poland, look curves lmao. almost ""best"" Europe 

what's worse ""start"" pandemic, idea worse get US

I guess could put state borders like hold Schengen Europe stop spread least bit. want lockdowns? shocked get laid off. really believe Chris Christie? Depends virus get vaccine for. Immune responses vary. 5 months I've hearing wishful-thinking-idiots saying we're past worst virus mutated less dangerous, people natural immunity thought, we've reached herd immunity realize it, pick random theory people fall love with, ignoring theory. 

It weeks ago Rand Paul arguing Fauci, saying there's much cross-immunity earlier similar viruses we're danger.  live life mind fucking business that's abstinence program kicking in. fairness Christie, fact he's learned near death experience rather doubling makes better lot peers. rest us vaccinated effective need test kids, contact tracing isolating difficult community transmission besides them. gave first real laugh day. Thank you! LMK die Covid boss. vast, vast majority people dying virus 65+, 75+. Id consider dying old age. think know why. Infection fatality rate means many people get receive treatment die. First all, US shit healthcare system means well ones really getting treatment since poorer people might able afford die go hospital fear ruined debt survive. Second, going herd immunity like means FAR infections leads hospitalizations and, reach point many, deaths due lack spaces hospitals covid patients others. Sometimes disregard courts certain national crises ...like Lincoln ignoring Supreme Court Civil War. people decide go could contributing spread virus around country. think reducing cases prioritised people’s perceived discomfort fact can’t stuff faces families.  150k Europe. North America 100k too. still popular argument. Sadly They've 'open change' 43 years lol. Democrat going different? imo part new generation surprised nothing ever changes. Trump incompetent shithead. See easy was? 

This another edition simple answers simple questions. Assuming lasting immune response, reinfection, mutation virus, etc.  mentioning crippling effects. could sacrificing millions absolutely nothing short term economic boost. immune systems thing likes adapt. #1 USA! USA! 🇺🇸runs around waving flag 🇺🇸 oh wait.... There's several vaccines China. Sinopharm one appears used quite widely even granted EUA UAE. SinoVac CanSino also look promising, although might generate slightly milder immune response mRNA vaccines Pfizer Moderna adenovirus ones Oxford J&amp;J. flip side, milder side effects. ranking countries based factors alone USA even near top 1, bloody hell. user listed comparisons. x8 testing mean x8 cases. mean “out control “? Nobody died lack care, beds, equipment. projections much worse. Average death 80 years old. People 80 die lot. government looking percentages got sick got died. percentage, chance actually dying, acceptable percentage them, entire country infected, number deaths bother government majority people ""get it"" thing magically disappear everything go back normal went everyone. care sick expected continue work. firmly believe care, absolutely clue they're doing, completely given expect thing go away nowhere one day. thanks fraudci said masks don’t work Aw. Good luck! Almost vaccine candidates works though. main issue safety time provides antibodies. think NZ fair comparison. Look dense populations like South Korea Germany. US even player comparison. facebook.com may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage, post automatically removed. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

Your leader still saying today masks don’t help we’re selfish ones, sure. made masks mandatory months ago, it’s well respected, can’t said people. masks mandatory inside workplaces too. 
The number one reason cases growing simply govt won’t shut restaurants. would make absolutely huge difference don’t want indemnify them. 
As long restaurans remain open, even it’s 9pm, people gather without masks infect other. can’t really blame them, mind they’re what’s expected them, supporting local businesses.

Trying go flow low expectations haha! crazy. among 100% identified cases COVID Qatar, outbreak leveled off, 0.01% people formerly tested positive came sick test positive again.

I mean, maybe 1% 100% even ever exposed second time virus, let alone questions caught it.

This study go retest everyone. simply looked positive cases identified Qatar's testing system found many people tested positive twice 45 day gap. 0.01% figure tells us Qatar's outbreak history reinfection.

Plus, study measuring cases occur within 2-5 month window immunity said lasting. people reinfected anyway.

The current understanding that, yes, people develop symptomatic response virus protective immunity least couple months.

The worry asymptomatic people might (people never tested first time) substantive protective immunity. especially 2-5 months almost everyone catch (although ""T-cell immunity"" may may lead less severe reinfections). Yes does.  remember hearing leaving toilet lid causes fecal matter violently spray damn place kid, led likely fastest ever picked stuck new good habit.

But sad part story would hear toilets loudly, proudly, lidlessly spitting fecal matter like mad camel eating ass often several years later actually started wonder complete myth. really true, could many humans know personally care little leaving washroom used fucking poop sprinkle cupcake every crap?

Luckily google able confirm correct. kids went back school. school district planning begin in-school classes next week New Trier going remote surge cases. people really like admitting wrong though? really about? people feel bad Americans get required medication Canada cheaper pay full price Canada ""discounted"" price paying insurance premiums. Probability says nothing possibly either, don’t see relates. Could elaborate? people smart enough see past name, able judge message based quality content.

Glad identified getting hung things relevant. People really believe yep. Melania going divorce trump became president lol. There’s lot potential evidence.. proof? knowledge. There's preventative cure that, sometimes... Says take seriously, bare minimum finally least excuse anyone country, sneaks advocacy loosening restrictions plea cases rising rapidly country. I'm less refreshed.  Well remember narrow fields specifically theoretical academics. 

If really think theoretical mathematicians/physicists academia getting paid 100k year? smoking good shit man. good friends states, understand tell good chunk people treating life business usual. 

Though I'm sure point election lot what's broadcast. think america continue attract skilled workers similar similar success coming decade? new forces/shifts play.  Godness may force you.
 2 kids born 2011 2014 want deal giving birth 2020 chose covid19 excruciating pain (ny daughter born holiday weekend July, finally epidural 8 close wreak havoc maternity ward) countries still purchase vaccines private pharmaceutical companies, they?  work hospital single confirmed even suspected reinfection. heard colleagues hospitals either. think point going restaurant risky take mask True dat found interesting read. Seems like people institutions world starting give up. Especially states. He's 8 family dead business gone. Source that? also got Pumpkin muffins banana crumble muffins. dozen $6 amazing steal giant cupcakes. Ironically, opposite affect me. I've worried safety, family's, everyone's safety months. wear mask leave house, hand sanitizer touch anything, thought Trump crazy. Chris Christie survive feel little less worried. /s  exactly

you cant, put eat restaurant  No, terrorists plane breaking script. People behaving past thirty years breaking script.

I think people wantonly spreading disease around, also self-awareness ask questions like ""Why one flexible?"" State Al Jaeger Monday said general election ballot cannot changed Andahl's death, mail-in voting began Sept. 24. As Tuesday afternoon, one-fifth 5,610 ballots mailed voters District 8 returned.  Council Director John Bjornson said happens election depends results.

A North Dakota politician died COVID-19, early voting started can't removed ballot. COVID-19 spread control North Dakota. think significant second waves lot places, see reinfections. People world, mostly, trying avoid catching virus.

My issue antibodies immunity studies scientists yet resolved virus's interactions immune system. Conventional wisdom apply, yet. cellular response, antibody production etc. etc. may imply people hope does. proven issues virus, three four major problems least, comes immunity.

Vaccines+challenge trials (with 6 month follow up) I'd start faith situation. forget long takes produce *and develop* enough doses vaccine expected work 3-6 months quick antibody decay. forget much dose likely cost country completely fucked health care system can't even provide cheap insulin, country health insurances able deny cancer patients chemo therapy deemed ""too experimental"". Holy mother fuck, shitty healthcare system kill many people. find legal way deny patients vaccine doses. 6 months till somewhat get back normal lives.

No no. Calm horses. Fauci giving rough estimates (and even estimates based *all* vaccines clinical trials successful!). timelines still change wildly many new surprises along way.

It foolish start counting months like that. talking release date movie something like that. talking complex dynamic situation.

Look back old news old discussions pandemic. find many timeline predictions look ridiculous hindsight. bad can't cure covid ricola. Ya, you’ll fit right Best prepared lol. anything Americans believe they’re best at? get news french newspapers, foreign blogs. 
If look french reports don’t stop title, you’ll see homeschooling religious spiritual reasons longer allowed. Children valid reasons, special needs “career” (athletes, celebrities..), still allowed home schooled, majority currently home-schooled children.

Again, one banning actua home-schooling since families affected law providing education kids first place, getting around law indoctrinate children keep away actual education.  ...because citing principle like herd immunity without understanding consequences reaching level? Surely not... Maybe like using buzzwords unreliable information deceive people. anti-science... anyone think masks become permanent part daily lives even virus eradicated? why? [Harvard Medical know contagiousness COVID-19 virus, experts estimate somewhere 60% 70% population needs immune order achieve herd immunity. That's close 200 million people United States, nearly five billion people worldwide. (As now, nowhere close numbers needed achieve herd immunity.) okay, could used current measures, I'm actually talking slowing spread keeping pubs clubs open.

\- Students lower risk

\- measures would temporary numbers go low (after unis start)

Also, right, raising death rate significantly No, means many people infected die. Receiving treatment numerator   compared US, certainly compared e.g. Texas live think asses really care? white nationalist nazi wanna dictator turned president cult following disproven christian god. deficit stems Congressional action. Fed different matter (and also significant) Easy one source word TRUMP Japan need take China approach, nation needed take China's approach. time China reacted, virus control knew almost nothing it. took drastic measures.

All nations quarantine international travelers 2 weeks, people wear masks. That's literally takes bring r0 1. Yes, occasionally get cases, spread like wildfire. Gaslight Obstruct Project first started thought would disproportionately impact cities care about. could point cities failures like ""anarchist"" shtick.

They underestimated ability spread low population density areas stupidity base Great, keep moral superiority--never made us dime. again, best luck. Free advice: learn Mandarin Wouldnt better strict lockdown/containment first time Fantastic news, unsurprising.

Important remember major candidates already well production pretty well assured least health care workers high risk groups access vaccine long approval.

The beginning end nightmare near. hospital like ""sorry, can't take you, we're full.""

It happened years ago. super uncommon hospital go ""code black"" refuse anymore patients. hospitals hit least year. much problem (divert 10 minutes next).

The \*real\* problem hospitals hit area need continues rise. That's gotta dip pandemic preparedness plan start triaging sending people home they'd otherwise admit start converting spaces beds. True, don’t isolate perfectly (my exposure lobby stairwell elevator building), don’t go otherwise. However, older family feel comfortable coming merging bubbles. addition tested positive antibodies twice going start donating plasma  we’re allowed say epidemiologists told us? say people stay locked inside? Sweden appears undergoing another wave cases rise there.  Daily New Cases graph. would caution despair. listened talk one leading coronavirus experts, optimistic. say lasting immunity infection known Coronavirus, due lack capability upper respiratory tract. 

The thing is, lower respiratory tract creates superspreaders well making virus lethal. effective vaccine would stop pathway allow burn out. Herd immunity infection always difficult. several thousand reinfected doesn’t really matter statistically though. know vast majority robust immune response lasting several months. likely people immune longer shorter, way “never immune all”.

We quite bit many die, behave correctly vaccine.  , German's generally trust government advice. 

Yet largest anti-lockdown demos world Germany, drawing hundreds thousands people. I'm guessing believe air gravity since never seen either. Two words: Donald Trump 60% people planning taking vaccine least year rona deathsentence, congratulations winning! first weeks pandemic (late-March early-April), Trump radio-silence COVID. Everyone started really supportive other, saying, ""What help?"" opened mouth started saying things like ""LIBERATE &lt;Democratic Governor State completely polarized it. Suddenly, providing support global pandemic good human, ""I'm actively supporting Democrats"", eyes Republicans. point on, consensus acting, mess since then. Scientific model funny word prophecy. Specially complex issue. 0.05 IFR people 70 man. objective. done April tho. really should. I'm gonna hard thinking right now. getting excited again. know try succeed. Inject veins, fam eliminate it, it'll keep infections low enough protect people give vaccine. line corona virus basically another yearly flu shot. Thank much work researching me! cool software compare them! great expert willing explain it! 

It's bad get cross reactivity. know theory early on... maybe level immunity conferred recent exposure common coronavirus. guess may small amount that, much.

I'm curious now, virus family viruses studying? I’m saying state’s team epidemiology stated incredibly smart hard working people. isn’t evidence one time write case reports transmission right now. They’re little busy. Take want it, trust epi people. would crawl pile used heroin needles covid patients coughing face vote shit stain.  Silly dam question, seen president is? DAM MORON!! Sounds pretty normal me! don’t think understand logic fairness utilitarianism moral framework developed modern age, it’s people ever reason like using primitive form whenever talk it. Might live extra 4 years die painfully two weeks. time already limit I’d probably continue conserve hopefully experience family way can. internal timeline since back May likely October vaccine approved start rolling out. November fine, feels like might push bit faster given spike we're seeing Northern Hemisphere?

Can anyone explain gap EUA miss distro? Pfizer note, everyone seems adding month two. 

If they're already making it, able parallelize packing shipping go Nov/Dec right? Always thought might get COVID vaccine Christmas morning :) routinely pre-stage shipments like that, curious here. Assume success parallelize timeline. lives lost treated statistic political agendas. worst offenders ones stating small percentage people die.

Line body bags end-to-end front lawn tell lot people died. truth 6 months scary first chart would look different. believe graphs like watching. deaths start rising anywhere herd immunity achieved would bad.

Anecdotally reinfections appear far rarer deaths. point article trying make Michigan well Whitmer. dad, voted Trump, fucking loves woman praise success COVID listen.

The Republicans state fought tooth-and-nail literally every measure taken. absurd. Daily Covid death count US currently lowest point since beginning July.

It trending downwards since beginning August continues so. Careful replies, moderators like ban people making things political despite fact entire government response Coronavirus politicized start. Good points, theres actually medical schools pretty cheap(relatively speaking) tuition. Check Texas state medical schools example. range 28~32k state tuition, means barely 6 figure debt graduating, easily pay back couple years.

Also, know well start hospital rotations junior year med school, start prepping now, could seeing patients 2.5~3 years. get excited? mention med schools students 40s nowadays. wish 4.0's college.

Time goes super fast, especially ages(late 30's) it? Instead going back apply med school, started online masters degree another major 2.5 years ago, almost finished, can't believe it, I'm thankful even though pretty tough.

3 years NOTHING. circumstances allow, absolutely it. yourself, anyone else. Future 3 years grateful current you. I’m practicing social distancing always wearing mask etc. 31 years old. time wondering really many obese old people walking around production crowded places, isn’t death rate exploding? ""lets kill grandma go bar"" protocol disinfect room positive patient using standard protocol YES, third paragraph press release sides BS basically took dump good things said.

They never take responsibility mess. Quite limb there. Care explain how? I’d love discuss trip someone socializing without mask less risky. tell. Everyone shitting US here. Much justified. 

A different factor look at. Vaccine development, may important factor fighting COVID. many countries develop early effective vaccine US one them? safe bet much world soon benefiting US vaccine research vaccine production article talking widely available. you? Antivaxxers even good excuse anymore. Well would stopping spread. Actively killing decent percent population sound smart likely hood reinvention seems plausible.  Sheet idiocy starting top.... makes sense. makes wonder would prove reinfections though. Thank Y-axis. :-)

It’s good practice comes charts. loopholes ...

* air ventilation system boarding leaving?
* many people sincerely keep masks alone airplane bathroom?
* quickly air bathroom replaced?
* going someone next starts coughing? stand leave? open window? :-P
* infection vectors passengers, stewards/stewardesses. walking around deep breathing talking. often everyone plane crew tested? daily? really?

An infected person infectious symptoms appear.

It suffcient one person team tested. tested avoid bad luck false negative results.

Reason: false negative rate best average 20%

 

 Trump using Barr personal lawyer. crazy morons flaunted science common sense perpetuate pandemic easily controlled elsewhere.  Plus good health insurance EVERBODY. Agree points. surely stopping spread, keeping R 1?

All things would lower R; say much.

If number cases low start with, also means measures potential keep number cases low.

There's huge spike recently, right around thge time unis started There's evidence either side this. press releases vaccines we'd cured now. tiktok No. criticising choice data. arguing spread. 

It possible divide two. believe that's what's known Commissar. Leaving work work, still degree social interaction. I've sitting home partner since March found handful times we've interacted people (even appointments) huge mood boosters break monotony home time Hopium. means available regular people. Good luck! Found it. matter hard try cannot stop spread highly contagious virus pub setting, cinema likes. wanna try.....Trashed Republic Unleashed Moronic Parasites One word: Trump many places mandate masks experience people stop distancing mask seen part. Wrong forum average American proven harder working clever people South Korea, Japan, China instance.

We best overall research universities world. yes, definitely running momentum. last 30 years, we've consistently refused invest back modernize critical infrastructure: energy, transportation, education, health, communication...all running behind, mostly coasting last century's efforts (especially post-WWII/New Deal).

If make determined effort re-invest last resources updating future, we're definitely going seeing nation decline. That’s exactly came say. hope state’s Supreme Court live potential deaths linked to. I’ve spoken people believe exists, since we’re young shouldn’t give second thought. call paranoid tell problems caused people ages catching it. Later, get invoice salt flower removal concensus belief since least end August. “Currently, seems Chinese students going abroad strong desire take vaccine,” CNBG employee quoted saying state-owned newspaper, Paper, based survey results September.

Students China due start semesters abroad say want vaccine worried getting sick.

“It’s dangerous there, town study in, it’s red danger zone,” said student goes school Poland gave surname, Ouyang. signed CNBG vaccine September heard back yet. “We really want vaccine.”

A student due go Britain said signed via online link classmates said received vaccine.

The student, would give English name, Sally, said started hear September vaccine available people her. said students said might need travel Beijing, national capital, Wuhan, outbreak emerged December, receive vaccine.

If vaccine works, might help protect students going Europe United States, pandemic still raging, medical experts said. said developers need make clear unproven keep track happens people receive it.

If vaccine doesn’t work, “this giving people false sense security,” said Sridhar Venkatapuram, specialist bioethics King’s College London’s Global Health Institute. Yeah, remembered that.  Indeed, must die. gallows her!!

/s isn’t obvious shit. Also absolutely nobody expecting 100% effective vaccine. expected people get vaccine, still get ill, especially rolls wider wider. Boss I’m going need better insult can’t assume everyone proves wrong high school president United States republican number one source covid related disinformation, democrats still bad.


Lol!

r/enlightenedcentrism going love look this. joke. ""They admit ""officially"" never happened"". ""Internal emails count"". Literally. *Admitting*. crime. ""Doesn't count"". made ""officially"".

 Fantastic denialist logic, Putin would proud. worse, Putin never hinted crime email. Bagdad Bob. \*now guilty policy *is* overblown.

75% COVID-19 fatalities (roughly 150,000) come 17% population (was?) 74.

I know many old people know, every single one I've ever met knows death reality day going live last precious days hermit might get sick. 

As result social media panic, wrecked economy everyone else year's worth education children (who 1 10,000,000 chance dying COVID-19). think conservatives became complacent 40 years major foe US USSR, ""red menace."" conservative call policy politician ""socialist,"" won.

I born 1975, vague memories Reagan communism enemy. life seen things favor attacked ""socialist,"" capitalism tied greed, waste, abuse, suffering. 

My generation, folks younger me, see socialism, least conservatives call socialism, good, capitalism (to big fail, insider trading, monopolies) bad.

The right 10 years turn things around, regulate capitalism stops darwinian, next red wave socialism, Republicans. cold, gets cold dark fall despite warm daytime temperatures. stays cool late noon. Ah, whataboutism, trademark true Trumpster. Don’t address anything original poster said, anything possible divert attention away Orange Daddy back awful democrats. Also, took response beyondbullsandbears.com suppose take seriously? even proper cold yet east coast Arrest murderers. God, knew social media showed us content agreed pushed people echo chambers could radicalized... never made connection algorithms run *deliberately created change behavior*. That's terrifying thought. need personal insults, Swedish treads already many people destroying conversations. virtual high school class must done day. said nothing behaviors. Yes, grandparents live overseas would like see rest family. seem lonely, know probably don’t much time them, crushed can’t spend time together travel bans. livid covid restrictions prohibiting old grandparents deciding would like live rest lives. die family see again, really don’t see could forgive that. belief everyone plan big assumption.. think mistake thinking on-off switch--where lockdown ""over"". think we're going spend lot time restrictions full lockdown still cause significant inconvenience. Yup virus mutated something less deadly, always possibility.

The thing gets politicized got. Like initially locked down, go anywhere. almost 2 months hunkered groceries, thats fine, gotta part. flattened curve nothing changed. areas hospitals never got overwhelmed, fact almost empty lay people off.

Last year, bunch kids died flu. died got virus chain transmission throughout society, absolutely nobody blamed shamed made feel bad it. Everyone accepted fluke occurrence, virus gonna virus, life, etc. social contract around infectious diseases.

But now, changed. Suddenly, way around. I'm responsible everyone else around me, responsible turn. reasoning, everyone wearing mask nazi grandma killer preferably thrown jail Yeah guy organic chemistry PhD appear kind virologist.

He argues virus molecules small basically mask anyone likely wearing filters anything small useless.
Clear statistical evidence contrary.

You can't treat virus like old organic molecule. virus kind lethally toxic nano particle, arguing people arent wearing mask built deal therefore masks wearing useless wrong. Hence doctors, virologists, epidemiologists people actually know taking wouldnt recommendeding kind face covering better none.

Clearly politically motivated ""essay"" Nonsense 

So far US exactly ONE documented case reinfection. One. 

Its something concerned So, slightly different subject, what's immigration prospect US citizen moving Germany look like medium term? cares stubborn people don’t change need compare infection rates severity control arm treatment arm. Let rephrase question, hopefully answer time:

*Given* always viruses circulating (asymptomatically symptomatically) kill thousands people per million every year....*what acceptable circumstances bars open*?

60,000+ people died influenza 2017/18 United States. agree coronavirus deadly know I'm supposed look 200,000 deaths say ""unspeakable tragedy blood hands"" looking 60,000 saying ""eh, c'est la vie."" lives 60,000+ died influenza matter less people died covid.

I yet anyone actually attempt answer question, first! Keep crying lil bro 😢 Umm...you basically proved point. You’re bright. rookie numbers... Uh, he's Trump gullible. Republicans get want: Freedom. Freedom die coronavirus. ""wailing"" defined mocking taking seriously, wailing like banshee.

I've obviously hurt feelings, too. Perhaps two meet up. Corruption ignorance even saying? Yes stay relatively safe. safer staying home Canada? Italy mess today Everyone smart Hollywood movies, human stupidity hands reality check. 10-20 euro's per test, put article English comments. Dude, whatever want desperately *want* believe they'll ignore evidence disproves it. Miserable fuck lol people America fucking morons brainwashed politics Already blocked person. worth time. delay inevitable. can't skip deal it. harmless bittering agent, poison blind kill you. guess thats Australian things Text English:

Europe preparing possible new wave corona infections, testing important ever. breath test offer easier faster alternative 'gold standard', PCR test.

Just blow device within minutes know COVID-19 among members. breath test could definitely offer solution fight current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. wonder several research groups companies world currently working hard governments also keen hear it. Netherlands Belgium, University Antwerp eNose Company, among others, working it.

Specific VOCs

Developing breath tests fast-growing field research several years now. wrote last year, electronic noses related devices 'smell' diseases asthma/COPD, lung cancer colorectal cancer. Researchers also expect infamous COVID-19 specific breathing pattern, like diseases mentioned.

Three mechanisms described literature whereby certain volatile organic compounds, VOCs, released via breath event COVID-19 infection', postdoctoral researcher Kevin Lamote UAntwerp states. intervention cells, virus cranks certain signal transduction pathways. immune system also switched course infection. finally, damage occurs result disease, oxidative stress. processes produces specific VOCs measured breath'. July, Lamote team published findings Journal Breath Research.

Every subsequent patient gets new sterile mouthpiece'.

Before analyse breath, 'catch' first. first challenge Lamote faced set project team early year. sampling device enables take breath sample without risk contaminating researcher doctor next patient. tried current technology, meet Ethics Committee's criteria'.

In end, Lamote colleagues succeeded designing something capture patient's breath safely effectively. approved ethics committee researchers currently testing further. Due current patent application, Lamote yet want say anything details.

The next step analyse respiratory profile. Antwerp case, done means gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). measurements specific VOCs spectrum put mathematical jiggernaut: deep learning machine. Lamote explains process works: 'A group corona patients group healthy people identified system. this, machine train able make good distinction respiratory profiles infected uncontaminated person, thus predict group person belongs to'. moment already possible make good distinction, says Lamote, still need testing.

Digitize

Another possibility carry analysis spot. e-nose ideally suited purpose. eNose Company develops e-nose, calls Aeonose. everyone want test breathes device. Yet too, risk infection nil. First all, every subsequent patient gets new sterile mouthpiece', says André Elands, CEO company. Secondly, use one-way valve system breathe inhale. absolutely sure, mouthpiece also contains HEPA filter, removes 99.99% viruses'. HEPA filter double hospitals use ventilation equipment ICUs.

I see nice synergy two technologies'.

The collected breath guides device various semiconductor sensors. redox reaction takes place,' explains Elands. changes conductivity semiconductor. change measure fabric passes by. happens many VOCs. change conductivity caused VOCs together form completely digitalised breathing pattern. Someone COVID-19 among members gives different profile someone ill. That's trained e-nose'.

Doctors Maastricht University Hospital used Aeonose examine two hundred care workers hospital. carried breath test well blood test PCR test see whether carrying coronavirus and/or produced antibodies. results soon published scientific journal.

So big difference GC-MS method e-nose former looks individual breathing components, latter looks whole picture. one future, Lamote Elands dare say. perhaps other's competitors all, according Lamote. see nice synergy two technologies. e-nose, system sent clinic relatively quickly. GC-MS method find targeted VOCs optimise e-nose'.

Early warning

The promise breath test great. example, breathing minutes device much finer cotton swab deep nose throat. price also attractive. According Lamote Elands € 10 20 per test, PCR test € 60. biggest advantage breath test compared PCR test done quickly. results time. Elands already see e-nose at, example, entrance airports, football stadiums hospitals. blow lot people short time. perfect early warning system. numbers see quickly there's outbreak somewhere. allows intervene lot faster'.

But we're still long way that. breath test, example, needs tested. example, yet well known reliable GC-MS analysis e-nose relation 'gold standard' currently used, PCR test. order verify precisely, validation study among large group patients healthy people still needs conducted projects. Lamote: 'And due recent increases number corona infections Europe, seems plenty work done coming months.  sounds exactly like Spain, July wear masks everywhere outside without exceptions. beach tighly limited people per area. really strict already end July.  /u/blazingsaint call wambulance got wailer 😢 yeah everyone lost job tried kill way I've perceived massive 2-3 week lockdown world went soften initial hit. Since makes sense limit lockdowns places medical capacity challenged, attempts masking distancing, less-than-lockdown precautions, fail keep numbers reasonable. 

If we're winding extended lockdowns often, sometimes case people keeping less restrictive precautions? think case could made instead hidden agenda stay locked vaccine. plz cry 😢 people understand individual states power implement covid restrictions? federal government gave authority things lot people complain lot. somehow doubt Trump enacting marshall law would gone well. model wrong every step way, trusting 4 months gonna much good.

It's key giving lower forecast numbers ones, politicians gravitated it. ever came title, get another job mention good ideas, especially air travel, yet see anything like prepared either party. Sadly, feel changing diaper results little actual improvement us... fighting irreverent stuff.

Luckily enough, I'm Seattle Mariners fan limited capacity matter much next summer. ...it’s option here? everyone luxury. Try harder troll. say anyone immune all?

The % infected belong group infected before. Given rare cases reinfection see people indeed immune time. Note ""immune"" binary, necessarily neutralizing, imply timespan. maybe people catching 'first time' knowing first time, could 2nd 3rd time.  
Inded like unkown number symptomatic reinfections, even larger number (most likely) asymptomatic reinfection. Im starting think going away. Ever. 

I think researchers agree likely become endemic. mean global lockdowns forever. likely case virus like Coronavrus, OC43. entirely possible current known human cold coronaviruses really bad pandemics initially, annoyance, people get contact young age kind immune response ready get  Probably lowering life expectancy average something we've artificially inflating decades.

Granted US venue many cool things, place cool stuff happens. blind study neither participants researchers know got vaccine got placebo. idea look data, can't enough positive cases sample fancy statistical stuff it. Lets forget 2% population infected .06% dying would call failure. Alternatively, US simply best prepared.

There could subconscious conscious bias report, given whole pandemic panned out, almost certain.  people thinking universities making bank they're going online; facilities management bulk university's budget. would help guys would kindly figure refrain America bashing every chance get. We've spent months hearing much suck based covid. bad, suck up. Fear among us media, thanks. delusional world US, enormous nation complicated federalist system, best prepared nation confront pandemic? What? Sounds like cop out.  CDC plenty blame shoulder mishandling response. Swing miss. leadership. Without consistent, clear message, individuals left fend results shitshow Naaaaa; overrated. fun guess. That's why. mainly spread guest worker populations, mostly younger healthy men Indian subcontinent Philippines, extremely segregated rest population really spread elderly people. English good 👍 Covid19 killed months years flu.


Restrictions proven help.

The fact people refuse follow problem. makes good point I’m compelled largely agree this! USPS can't anything right! can't get money Bill Gates going handle votes? /s thought double blind literally can't know results Phase 3 yet. F1 car lap circuit 1:20, put fucking Nana cockpit it, gonna get ""almost inconceivable"" failure lap time. It’s exact opposite strategy. Maybe didn’t understand followed pattern many states US. Interesting. Yeah looks suspicious. Gestapo/ Stasi need 22 page article figure one. grandparents, parents they're older, love themselves? so, take precautions protect instead expecting young people stop anything social enjoyable? accountability health?

My mother works manual laborer factory state cares little COVID. sent N95 masks effective protecting wearer cloth masks. old people town going brunch without masks, younguns. know getting searched anyway man oh man make stupid decisions Incompetent leadership. Also, line Gilead's data. Death rate affected. data always indicated makes disease bit shorter, save severe illness. never ideal treatment believe shit????
Supermarkets open parks closed fck logic science Bigbrain time. one ""virtual"" thing pandemic I'll probably jump roof. You’ll November 4th Florida man Florida man does. worse even that. expected dumb person might run it, never expected dumb, petty, evil piece shit would LITERALLY THROW PLAN TRASH moment made aware existence. Great. need transparency. mean burning plan task force put together audacity blame previous guys shit plan. Cuz doctor Fauci balls called ""Racist"" stop BLM Flagellants, bearly wear masks? way convey information quickly enough.

I idea... involves building fire intermittently throwing wet blanket top coded pattern. People miles away receive message relay others. think could even type thing using flags. Nah, recall timeline even back March end 2020 early 2021 vaccine we're lucky. mostly seem stuck timeline, great. Second wave December rich guys second stimulus. failure leadership national state level.

*Thank you.*

This sub seems obsessed blaming redcaps anti-maskers everything, truth US government reacted properly lied public Day 1 factions made significant difference, like countries.

This governmental failure, through. can't blame people following words democratically elected POTUS, *can* blame democratically elected POTUS complete utter failure damn job hired do. even good reacting, either. problem since get $50,000 every time diagnose coronavirus case.

Just LIEbrul elite fearmongering flyover states.

/S days, fuck knows. Trump. There. Answered question particulars. Thank you, AlbaMcAlba, voting AutoModerator.

Playing weekly options margin without understanding damn thing buying shares bankrupt companies . want quick play make big money quick lose 99% time.  I'm sure largely unpopular opinion thought I'd throw see happens.

I'm wondering people like young, low risk, live alone. I'm wearing masks (properly, that), going gatherings, eating restaurants, traveling via plane reason, working home employer allows this. cross street people walk toward me, especially elderly people.

However, main shame I'm still feeling spending time people, one one, home settings without mask. research, history viruses, show COVID going totally eradicated, even vaccine. cool families 5+ parents working person that's chill, yet others may expected give social contact? One could say meet outside, winter. touch starvation real. 

I'm wondering people expecting - sometimes feels like ""you near anyone live least 2 years,"" times I'm sure projection. much one person expected give up? Everything? Even people give little nothing?

This jab masking, going gatherings that. sucks, I'm willing. feels bit touchy sacrifice social relationships time life happened single. infuriating people live 5+ housemates in-person jobs form ""germ pods"" treat like *I'm* one likely plague spend time handful people live with, also work home live alone, one one. logic this?

Thanks ahead time commiserating. want fake empathy anti-maskers call COVID hoax. ain't it. appreciate take, although fully agree it.

I think helped Vietnam mix factors:

-heavy distrust China said (and something common across East Asia);

-EARLY ACTION! European countries luxury. actually aim eradicating virus completely catch early enough lockdown hard immediately, like Vietnam NZ did. around, around contain best (like Korea doing)

-border closures. Vietnam afford keep borders closed indefinitely quarantine everyone entering. European countries cannot.

All all, applaude Vietnam's response find extremely swift effective, also find quite useless unproductive compare countries completely different situations say done like Vietnam did.

Funnily enough, Greece somewhat compared Vietnam context. reopen borders summer international tourism lifeline economy. Yeah live busy city never wear mask outside lol. someone wants distance cross street away me. Excellent post Nurse here. family health care US (Kaiser Permanente), UK (London NHS), worked Philippines (modelled US health care), New Zealand, Australia. absolutely know talking about. US Covid death rate statistics full reflection reality simply lot people Covid die Covid tested documented died Covid. Socialist health care systems mean universal health care get tested even cough diarrhoea loss job mean cannot get tested health care all. Socialist health care systems mean citizen right quality care. Socialist health care systems also support unions workers like doctors nurses push safe working environments safe staffing especially public health. know nurses US field deal bullying reusing face masks management wants save money. problem either New Zealand Australia. 

I'm frontliner. family. Please stop talking something clearly knowledge experience about. KNOW ANYTHING. know shit American private health care system would *never* work there. brain much self-respect. got nursing save people regardless are. glorified maid. actually first hand account nurse NZ worked got soon could. health care system disgusting. profit

You consider US UK's responses gold standard disaster capitalism disasters. could live fire station, fire could still break out. one acknowledges urgency put out, listens experts telling best way put out, throw oil around fun, get mad fire spreads control. country live in. Murica!!! freedom watch shit burn ground. states something.... 

Not damn thing changed two weeks ago two months ago. 

I hope right see reason magically plateau change nothing behavior. even need work state local officials. Current federal health laws already give President power institute national mandate CDC. 


Or, Congress could existing commerce laws “We can’t let science dictate decision making.”-this excess mortality anything go numbers worthless anyhow. see still make zero sense.

Their death rate greater Michigan's. That's based population. 

What fuck even mean open? joke getting old, shut fuck u/Gilgamesh72 May want come back delete extra posts. bad point, though think failure cynicism imagination. probably assumption voters allowed Trump advance primaries, let alone well enough general beat even weaker candidate like Clinton. Well, second wave. U.S. never left first someone come talk spray aerosols face nice thing friends/family/co-workers right now. anti maskers stop treating people badly? 

I read anti maskers violently attacking sometimes killing people asked put masks. nice way behave? 

People want protect loved ones right every right wear mask social distance. would continue plague?  care coronavirus kills dead! /s Didn’t Europe exact opposite strategy boat US moment? work private healthcare clinic, 7 8 doctors dont think covid kind serious issue. 2 7 believes fake political tool together.  People spend time energy pointing people wrong instead stepping something. Take ownership. Herd immunity lie made trump. can’t immune covid. solution everyone stay fuck home goes away. Even vaccine, people won’t take thus covid still exist. can’t that, people dying thanks trump fascist lies. Government distrust.

""What cost lies"" German culture definitely puts greater emphasis follow rules USA. question. easy.

America broken country.

40% ever believe Republican president, another 40% ever believe Democrat.

If Trump called masks day 1, would anarchy.

If called shutdown, would riots. wow, fucking stupid headline, moron president. Please come mid-November! year absolute nightmare. Trump need live fear like everyone else Republicans happened. Republican party Michigan basically saying fuck science full speed ahead herd immunity!

The blood hands. Donald Trump.

It's hard understand.

He's failure.  nothing changed? Rich get richer poor get poorer. i'm fat :( That's lot words say ""Donald Trump everything could wreck Obama's legacy, including pandemic contingencies"". I've got two words you.

Donald Jenius Trump. 741 million europe, 446 million eu disagree. 

But get vast majority people board idea. 

I wanted start this.  thought annoying long ago. constant self-loathing cute funny. ""I'm sorry Americans stupid! wish could move Europe/Canada/Australia/New Zealand!"" tough guy American good fucking luck state city tries  Fuck you. favorite thing line often mods remove it.

Despite fact quote president deaths America. can't muster respect people socially distance wear masks save lives. pretty simple. 

There lot innocent people hurt virus, energy care people helped cause it. Thanksgiving plans swap dishes folks - dishes reheated oven, btw - eat separate homes video call. 

My mom's great cook side dishes, roast mean turkey. 

It's going OK. Trump republicans guess solution death toll high people revolt it. sub-counting hubdreds countries, let's guess real number 40M Agreed. Fauci obviously conservative estimates masks/distancing. can't tell public we'll distanced summer say kidding going longer.

Give us week. ~~/s~~

I really wish sarcasm, not. 

Its nuts Wisconsin massive anti-mask crowds, think hoax, open packed bars. see photos weddings, parties, gatherings Facebook regularly. Sheriff's openly refusing enforce mask social distancing mandates. Republican controlled legislature (with 48% total vote 60% seats due gerrymandering) openly supports legal challenges masks social distancing orders done anything 170 days - adjourned March plans vote anything rest year. How?

Trump. ""Europe control! Americans stupid!"" Deus Vult Flocks feather expect social distancing, masks, crowds events years. said decades. 

So long mutate worst, generally agree. European numbers difficult interpret. Even hit case records, bad April LOT less testing then. stay current path, get worse, they're yet.   country anything needs money-maker billionaires.

Plenty people made enormous fortunes pandemic. $10 trillion billionaire bailout completely successful. 

Massive numbers people dying measure used Congress, administration Wall Street.

This 'success' delivered parties.  smartest people profited  smart people failure imagination, didn’t occur someone would intentionally destroy people.  counties requiring governor made clear that
the executive order signed mask requirement doesn’t apply “any person voting, assisting voter, serving poll watcher, actively administering election.” person kicks stink wearing masks public polling location, can't denied right cast ballot. 

In city, people told go car ballot machine brought them. cities/counties that. know someone voted yesterday rural part Texas people without masks with. said two poll workers wearing face shields PPE. idea would depend Republicans caring human lives, don't. NYC said go rimming IIRC Trump don’t stuck this, need follow public health guidelines. 

If actually put hands deck effort suppress virus 60 days. Everyone stays house except mission critical treat virus keep order. stores go delivery pickup only, everyone wears mask etc... lower prevalence virus 99%. open slowly rapid tests people take daily, virus extinguished and/or effective vaccine. 

I think south East Asian countries Australia New Zealand shown us doing. Wow, definitely jealous restaurant tickets. topic kinda, anyone else still go work every day?

My office never shut down. require wear mask common areas, distanced people added hand sanitizing stations. someone exhibits symptoms, close floor “deep cleaning.” feel soooooo lucky although sucks, nobody lost damn mind. Everyone living life. 15%.  living Indiana Kroger only, get it. Piggly Wiggly sounds 'Rona. yet. expect first interim analysis next two weeks. sad reality TV show narcissistic star president country regularly starts wars, bombs countries kills citizens. Obviously serious.. Yeah, hope well regulated capitalism things moved government control make sense, e.g. health care. 69,420 swear hate people sometimes. Almost ? Let's forget US health care system fully privatised. There's universal health care.  Simple, college longer Thanksgiving break less days beginning year, Thanksgiving over, go completely online semester over. “AmErIcA FrEe CoUnTry FrEeDoM sPeEcH”. many Americans head far derrière aren’t willing band together sacrifice little bit freedom greater good. 

As someone laid off, decently sized nest egg almost completely drained worn mask religiously since pandemic began, bitter jaded beyond words. Everything family endured year basically done nothing. :( tried go moon every human Earth playing small critical role, would never gotten either.

Instead, took massive amounts money large numbers morons (taxpayers), threw money small group smart people (NASA), told get done.

But kind problem small group smart people solve. Like climate change, demands collective action, simply capable collective action. sub turned r/politics. seems whole western world plagued incompetent leadership campaign disinformation. question dumb, author acts like exists paper real. lived US time known would bad start. institutions culture rotting decades. academic would even ask question. mask never wash. Wow realize 2010 Class 1 drivers licence Wow realize 2010 Sweden failed shelter vulnerable, think US could it? Wow looks pretty bad.

This cases since June. course well known red states consider virus much priority many blue states, would never take snapshot one season make complete conclusion.

Seems pretty obvious wonder change weather gets colder north.


Link directly  $12k*   pretty frustrating... probably could 'open up' more, everyone extremely cautious, wore mask, limited in-person interactions much possible... Hospitals would probably still packed, small businesses everywhere would still struggling... 

But would almost certainly better balance now, half nation extremely careful, half care... People want open everything back up, way POSSIBLY without completely overwhelming healthcare system killing tons people EVERYONE extremely vigilant, takes every possible precaution.

There's much talk death rate, feel like totally lost track whole ""flatten curve"" aspect talked much start pandemic... death rate stay low (relatively speaking) long hospitals handle load. Fuck guy, pulled thing Hurricane Sandy 2012 ""oh bad"" ""OMG Obama thank saving us known better""

Fuck ignorant fuck. probably singing ""hocus pocus"" focus. doctors moving Texas?? absolute shit-show ridiculous backfire. 


Like telling you, I'll believe see it. 


One tiny little ""oh yeah, happens"" nobody take vaccine. Good know said idea things her. thing know whole staff eat sleep there, maybe also reason need mask. said idea thanks put Infos u/Number_Bot !Covid19 -United States need normalize death counts general deaths/1M: USA number 10. (behind Spain, Belgium and, yes, Brazil), Italy, UK, Sweden far behind

Don't get wrong: USA likely worse most/all Western Europe, article's title logic still piece bullshit: enough real bad news, reason manufacture I'm ok masks becoming bit normalized. May cut illness rates. enlightened centrist. Fuck mean Republicans? listening president? prescient! Must witch!

:/s looks like eating ballots 9 meals day. Fat assed fat ass! still relevant? go back ever planet came eat shit Russian spy boss.
If u can’t tell hate white shit mound “man”. people still go shops without covering nose mouth.

Hm. Sputnik's approval little publicized phase 3 trial give credit I’d actually argue complete opposite US. enforcement would catastrophe. Korea. Japan Vietnam (I used live countries). tons advantages aggressively anti-authority country individuals, compliance health mandates one them. Plus Us kinda dumb. 

Just program works monoethnic Confucian country without community spread mean works country like US.  Going record deaths, winning! /s fail?? seriously asking that... think it’s pretty obvious. Unless live rock brain rock. I've seen nothing personal life would lead describe U.S.'s response this. Funny... 90% rest world's leaders better job. Guess China's blame too. Think lemming Journalism dead. expecting exist never existed first place. preconceived notion freedom is? topic, loved calculus school. :) It’s Bingo. great. people decide risk level is, part. I've hanging people small gatherings, eating restaurant patios, seeing family. 

I mean, statistically, like even there's 1% chance exposed, .1% chance dying catch it, marginally higher chance severe case, that's like .001% - .01% chance complications, versus 100% chance kind anxiety/depression lack human contact. know I'm talking effects you, relatively careful, stay home feel ill, avoid at-risk people much can. Pssst here’s tens thousands scientists health professionals disagreeing Fauci president said “oh don’t need this” pandemic preparedness book proceeded basically sell equipment virus hit  mean live US got 4 year degree university less 25k four years. don’t go big school get degree. Thank fucking God live there. know answer; however, soaking get comment removed sub. mean, wasn’t *strongest* joke definitely didn’t deserve downvotes! I’ll back know why? cus ufkc odnald turmp Wealth inequality terrible. people clue, think current wealth distribution vs looks like reality mind boggling.

Watch video prepared depression. Also note video 7 years old, last year top 1% doubled wealth track double Similarly depends part Europe form small pod people practicing safe behavior contact eachother reasonably safe meet. obviously optimal complete separation. members pod mixing pods becomes less safe. Yea getting sick sucks. shut society could simply implement targeted controls high risk population.

However even that, majority people 75 would say fuck anyway look death way younger people. long Inspector General sacked Generalisimo might work. Objectively, structures put place allow first-rate response pandemic.

But current administration started dismantling structures almost immediately, probably dismantling anything previous administration done little analysis whether would bad thing.

It get talked often, one first egregious program cuts contributes today administration decided severely cut funding state department led Complex Crisis Fund. cross-disciplinary effort put experienced people ground worldwide hotspots better help mitigate lower risk United States. potential pandemics, also prospect military coup civil war country could constitute threat left unrest, yes, experienced cross-disciplinary team designed specifically go places pandemic possibility pandemic rumored possibly occur. rumors leaking China well pandemic confirmed. purpose fund teams would deployed would send people either validate shoot rumors, rumors validated, start exerting substantial US influence host government act react certain ways would lower threat US. fund cut 2018 budget cuts went effect 2019. China portion program abandoned due newly restricted amount funding available program overall.

This one thing previous administrations put place deal potential unknown things could happen would threaten US security. reason highlight rarely gets discussed, canary coal mine current administration dismantling good government peril. see results that.

I want throw shoe either TV person speaking directly talk shutting flights China January. First, 40,000 people able exempt restriction, second, even 100% restriction, would already late pandemic growing long restrictions enacted. fund cut, would position know going act intervene hit shores. least really limit much hit shores.

So agree skepticism around say versus really are, prior administration, felt like previous administrations really put government programs entities place attempt deal missteps we've made handling pandemic. dismantled piece piece, along many elements good government. inexcusable. 8mil cases / 330m population = ~2.5%. Pretty close. *cries usa* ProPublica amazing investigative journalism. also nonprofit! underrated organization opinion.

Thank you. Unfortunately I’m allowed leave apartment, walking isnt option :( That’s devastating news. much hard-fought progress Tuberculosis major jeopardy, *still* kills 1.5 million people per 2020 global report TB released World Health Organisation (WHO), Thursday, indicates disruptions services caused pandemic led setbacks progress already made report, global TB deaths could increase around 0.2-0.4 million 2020 alone**, health services disrupted extent number identified TB cases falls 25-50 per cent three months

The report also says efforts stop extremely dangerous drug-resistant TB could impaired. 

Countries affected Subsaharan Africa (Nigeria, South Africa, etc) South/Southeast Asia (India, Indonesia, Philippines, etc). areas Africa 40% people unable access TB treatments due economic damage global supply chain disruptions. Untreated TB means people die spread countless others.

Efforts fight AIDS also seriously impaired. grim reality - people dying everyone else resources. Gloryhole still safe, right? I’ll listen dr Anthony Fauci thanks. went record saying approach herd immunity ‘ridiculous’ top public health expert country wrong? one politicizing BOOMER. whole wave definition really vague. second “wave” supposed kind level first one, far don’t seem acceleration it. least yet. 

And that’s based ICU numbers, incorrect cases data. case maybe 1/3 effective vacine that's still 100 million.

Assuming double-dose candidate, that's 50mil americans vaccinated. easily cover healthcare workers that! sure many elderly + essential workers like grocery store employees. case, 50 million vaccinated would cut deaths significantly. bet think ""just wait two weeks"" fantasy land. lol TrumpVirus Regarding lockdowns, proof works lockdown removed seeing unprecedented infections/deaths.

Sure less testing done surely measure death ratios. 

Stay safe Yeah, that's including summer whatnot. comes one worse *right now*, Europe bit. people like grandma grandpa getting kicked cliff.

But they're okay influenza 65 likely die Covid-19 past 7 months murdered past 2 years.

Murder rates dropping significantly years country. low risk people.

If young, far likely meet end hands car covid. Yet pathologically resist attempt reduce driving, regulate vehicle speed &amp; size, repurpose roads transit, etc. Depending part US in. Go hide Okay Zoomer also caring spreads people. Wear masks, social distance let natural selection thing say.

Get American exceptionalism fuck outta lol dude right nose mask. don’t even wear one you’re dumb. Set aside politics listen science. great news don’t know anyone who’s high risk, virus concerns article incredibly misleading. cherry picks data make US (and extension Trump) look badly possible. election close by, one wonders journalists misleading readers.

Here 2 cents article:

Journalism dead. turned shit show bury Trump election. month ago ND 34th per capita. Two weeks rate (+100 per million per week) it'll close Top 10. plan account dumb people, stupid plan. much I'm quarantine, always possibility quarantine could die unrelated causes. could everything right sometimes unfair shit like happens. Herd Immunity Incompetent administration. Vote fuckers never let fuck country again. done them. countries taking overflow neighbors yet?  Rural hospitals already shutting pandemic struggling cash already see pandemic force hospitols shut Trump. missing fundamental aspect Republican voter. always believe happen them. get laid off. catastrophic injury. lose health insurance. die. Etc... R U P talking coronavirus zombie apocalypse? defense spending highest world, also intentionally inflated defense contractors charge 60 bucks steel nut so... We're still going it. update done. Automod, guy responding political maintaining ""plausible deniability"". know he's political troll. One favorite ""bands"" Perth - Tame Impala. Ya'll something right there. Trump ended friendships everyone believed ridiculous things i'd friends.

source: live rural US south betting vaccine developed nine years faster average three years faster ever done before.

Yet I'm one get it. Yeah, right.

A basic rule thumb: something sounds good true, probably is.  

You expect vaccine developed quickly either unsafe else largely ineffective.  Given intense pressure bring something market, bet latter.  

And latter may actually worse social distancing facial coverings tossed window many expecting much they've jabbed, spreading virus new wave.

Meanwhile, Trump promised vaccine October. October. Oops. I'm dismissing entirely. I'm prioritizing waaaaay ideas consensus. suspect priority WH desperately need funding groups funded GBD. kinda diametrically opposed hired experts. 200,000 8 months enough you? Gotta pump numbers up? admit US never bad country.

Seems Western countries catching too.  Seriously doubt social distancing taking place past march I'm going hope Fauci conservative Good thing big groups take proper precautions avoid Cue deniers downvote brigades. think biggest problem far people listen. misinformation floating around begin people tuned it. let villiage idiots drive. true certain extent, also take account countries like Belgium Netherlands like one big city. could go one side country back one day still time stuff destination. terms connectivity places people, Netherlands Belgium like little New Yorks. constant use emoji sure makes seem legit. aware of, signatures saw pretty legit, even twitter handle posted signed it. die painfully 4 years. 88 lucky still go casino. may knows he's within year two needing rest home care virus gets first. previous models massively exaggerated rates tolls. time gonna right though I'm sure. Yes, many vaccines require boosters immunity last amount time life. I'm coming 10 years since last Tdap I'll needing another those. Covid immunity vaccine might last 6 months, year, 5 years, cant say sure get one time passes. matter gov tries, useless people refuse follow laws/guidelines.

We screwed. got something others don’t got, god given right breathe!


Hate add but..../s mean reinfection exactly unheard different viruses. rare, long rare COVID-19, herd immunity reached. Donald. John. Trump. 0. Lack N95 masks Epidemiologists literally studies spread diseases, already model diseases uses data form opinion. one gave example also mathematician. literally perfect fit form opinion I'm sure dismiss fast besides trying ignore facts match thinking. Merican Rugged Individualism half us avoiding vaccine

That means it'll twice twice hard spread. Ignorance, hate indifference towards fellow human beings one hell drug. Yes, need mask reliable cure flu viruses. opportunity make better normal better sanitation practices. fair, first wave March-May testing done.

True. claimed current wave higher April-May...

By way, argument shows many lies Tegnell cohorts telling back April/May. numbers reporting intentionally artificially reduced disguise real results ridiculously stupid ""plan"".

The fact remains, without doubt second wave hitting Sweden. Otherwise else explain numbers new cases increasing levels seen since June? testing regime last couple months remained stagnant. testing many people, number positive tests doubled.

They certainly ""spared"" second wave. Well asked.

Censoring hard job. meritocracy paramount. seems dirty word today. Purposely allowing spread originally thought White House Republicans would mainly hit Cities tend democratic. intent decimating Democratic leadership using straw man argument ""Look horrible areas Democrat charge"". expanded conflated political stances. One stance Republicans change stance strategy COVID instead downplaying it, would perceived admission mistake mishandling part. know Trump doubles mistakes. Add Republican Party dares disagree, contradict fall step Trump adopting new Party Country platform. No, wasn't. That's bullshit. national stockpile N95 masks, meant protect Americans epidemic, never replenished 2009 H1N1 outbreak. US PARTICULARLY VULNERABLE anything.

Fuck article. someone considering moving Portugal... that’s pretty depressing read English first language fluent enough understand he/she saying weeks numbers lower last weeks. Maybe read his/her post again? He/she said reported number Friday lower last Fridays reported number. since last time happened, since numbers generally going up. voted for, so, whatever. pandemic far over, it’s said done we’ll able compare viruses, potential kill Spanish flu. many times someone fend virus they’re longer able again? That’s even considering mutates something worse entirely possible, rarely talked due official narrative isn’t big deal. scanned article.

My opinion failed: selfish bunch sycophants (and people fell line sycophants) pandering xenophobic minority came power, care nothing well-being public care small group people make richer. sycophants.

I mean, look, idea discussed even initially exercised nothing stop spread virus hopes preferentially took competing base enough died number advantage election.

How nutty sycophantic need even think leader country. true central leadership. That's failed, disgrace I'm sad everyone lost loved ones. Maybe, validating ridiculous beliefs remaining friends, regardless. point social cost beliefs damage society. heard first time declared pandemic. pure luck ready human trials.

The drug making 20yrs.
The hope would work SARS strains.

Trump care till offered him. never financial stake company created antiviral. tell lie big enough keep repeating it, people eventually come believe it. Lol seriously. think author watched many hollywood movies US government/CDC/etc hero.

If Asian nations skills, experience, knowledge, willpower contain fail, rest us hope. Ridiculous man lol. seen plan? I've heard lot call playbook, never actually seen it. Trump+misinformation +right wing media telling big deal+stupidity=recipes disaster sound well put together. Get air. Rural voters electing decades politicians promise gut rural healthcare... so, guess wanted. LMAO 10-30k daily cases initial outbreak, look ICU admissions wanna know deaths much lower dumbass No, isn't.

Both Dakotas top 5 states terms per capita cases. North Dakota 23rd deaths per capita. South Dakota overwhelmingly survivable. Relax. One word... Trump. ""High rural populations""  

NZ urbanised US. (""People urban areas"" / ""Total population"" ) 
At individual state level, comparable urbanisation Colorado Maryland. 

If NZ US state - it'd 25th population. subject speaking He/she talking reported numbers. talking numbers put date tested/result (not sure which). number yesterday chart 596 example. reported number 1075. reported number day change, keep mixing up. Maybe purpose, pointed (regarding deaths). Exact shit Romagna btw, we'll see surprisedpikachufaces everywhere finally shit hits fan. next weeks going ride... Well unlike President Camacho president actually cool guy understood know up. Camacho hired people indeed know together solved problem referring scientists experts. 

just like movie Idiocracy except picked somebody even worse President Camacho. 45 new 13 Plenty circumstantial evidence. know guys think ""I've got scientists agree me"" great argument peer review even better one. vast majority peers think quacks regard. 

It's far easier buy scientists vast majority them. Damn beer temptation written it..... no! planned ahead stockpiled year supply classic american, lonestar busch beer New york declaring people dead COVID-19 without even postive test. states well. 

The death numbers overblown. way accurately record covid deaths- either underestimate overestimate overestimate None far, expect data, cases going up, end month. U.S. ""perceived"" world's best prepared nation confront pandemic. Arrogance known flu outbreak understand wearing masks choice, don’t see widely used. need soapahol, Alcohol based soap Yeah dude objectively wrong here. definitely needs learn subject lurk around sub. * US 83% testing per million UK.
* **the equivalent 79,048 US cases**, US 66,129.
* UK positivity 5.7%, US 4.8%, France 12.6%.

Don't editorialize titles, especially misleading statistics. said died. one. comment staple Argentina posts, always gets replies. Long story short: CORRUPT GOVERNMENT + PANDEMIC = DISASTER. locked us hard, first-world hard, people-going-bankrupt-hard, excuse preparing health system. Well, look numbers now. Seems government priorities elsewhere. Vitamin common 99% deficient vitamin die Covid according recent study  (Vitamin &amp; preventing Covid organ (Poor rats, lungs &amp; D) (ACE2 &amp; Elderly (Black Population &amp; ACE2 (Hypertension &amp; (ACE2 &amp; Diabetes). Funny say that, moved Redding Seattle past year I'm moving back due better job offer there. I'm fan Redding's attitude, also miss simple was. know one 89 year old women bone cancer. It’s incredibly rare, now. What? good portion people personally know think try quickly develop herd immunity COVID social distancing, etc., also people don’t want vaccinate kids even told protects others herd immunity. don’t care herd immunity. want whatever want—whether it’s vaccinating kids refusing social distance pandemic. invoke pseudoscience convince want justified. yeah I'm pretty sure can't go sticking kids needles willy nilly, get approval FDA start kind testing. workers protesting social scrubs less.

My anger everyone freaking beginning pandemic, threw concern window protests started. Seems eventually emboldened large portion public ignore gathering restrictions studies linked protests outbreaks.

As pointed out, we're talking healthcare workers protesting, cops. many died reinfection? Push ups actually help build bench though. Pull ups too, nice strong lats. people experiencing worst symptoms reinfected. died.  I'll forgive bodyweight comment play bannerlord, thin ice. No. isn’t problem. That’s implying correlation said spinal issues effects vaccine. fact one thousands thousands suggests isn’t likely spinal issue caused vaccine. currently likely caused something else. Statistically speaking, correct. 

Again, yes, literally completely normal vaccine trial see type issue like dealing thousands people. Nearly every single vaccine trial seen this. Every single one. 

But importantly, reason findings like important even adverse side effect like one mentioned, one person makes easy identify that, people could avoid getting virus. 

It isn’t bad news someone spinal issue terms success vaccine. normal things like happen.

Also repeatedly said idea “don’t care person” wrong, entertaining point anymore. people ICU past week yet like 5 deaths. guess people dying get ICU. Also mentioned article two elderly facilities currently outbreaks 28 deaths come one two. regulations assume results phase 3 trial far good, least terms safety? voicemail full, haven’t received texts. I’ll clear inbox maybe start answering calls. Iwasaki believes answer because, least far, reinfected people immune response second infection, suggesting virus developed way around immune ""There currently evidence variant emerged result immune evasion,"" wrote. ""For now, one vaccine sufficient confer protection circulating variants."" say God save Queen, fuck her. Put mask old bag I'm tired politicization COVID masks, pretty disappointed leadership. 


Whats frustrating parents cannot understand mask-refusal politicization COVID come Whitehouse. (They consume alot Fox news.) pressed it, I'm received words ""What could done?"" LOVE documentary!!  [This read characterized best case scenario. doubt disproves read. know totally updog. This. part USA live makes huge difference degree 1st-3rd world (btw really longer definition value days community. denying wealth inequality country. *could* make adjustments avoid extreme poverty. “we” control board idea. Collectively we’re headed towards even uneven distribution wealth power. Lots things work ton medical staff advising you. get ""wait see"" treatment. lot treatment contingent upon symptoms, time think late. Please go /r/Melbourne let know proud supportive persistence. Victorians show world done could inspire others fight it, like New Zealand. wear mask everywhere bruh come people go social media internet help medical issues. taken seriously actual doctors. Ah, tyranny meta-analysis. might correct, might better original authors provided details going statement would readable general public monograph.

There much dispute science heart argument, however. know lot disease March turned much *less* nightmare told expect. also know impact lockdown March turned much *more* nightmare told expect. 

All declaration says revisit base assumptions light available data. know process: observe, hypothesize, test, analyze, etc. believe Great Barrington Declaration heretical must suppressed regrettably demonstrates come far days Galileo purged authorities daring challenge beliefs.

Besides, many scientists practitioners reading endorsing statement, nobody argue declaration sufficiently peer reviewed. might even represent consensus, sub-rosa not.

If make feel better, allow make revision:

***More 37,000 medical public health scientists medical practitioners spoken. ignore folly.*** It’s sketch. time, need test vaccine children get vaccinated. think reasons adding children. joking right. GJ US keeping gold! choice atm. long story. hurry finish. high end escorts? cited NBC News. Oof, grammar police! :D important part post grammar, right? vaccines testing designed prevent infection. designed prevent illness. one prevent infection altogether years away. pandemic heard about... keep failing understand virus airborne:

They quarantined people cruise ships. failed HEPA filters ventilation system. sent home told stay home families.

They started testing fever screen people getting airplanes. failed missed lot people infected fever. nearly every country.

They told people stay 6 feet apart stay home sick. failed airborne particles circulate air hours. COVID remain surfaces days.

They kept sick separate well. failed many carriers asymptomatic.

They tested people letting bubble controlled area, still see fails virus transmitted people test positive.

They still can't figure out, maybe government fired scientists can't develop test collects exhaled air samples detect someone carrying airborne virus.

For time being, wear mask, sanitize things exposed people, self isolate much possible. Stay safe. surprised message gets removed I'm forced delete get dozens votes per day. wife dead ...and kids gay...a la la article this? I’d love believe it.

I’ve read much shit lately “even vaccine we’re gonna distance forever!” articles make super anxious. I’d love counter article help disprove above, clearly information don’t. they're HUUUGE... Computers rocks taught think using lightning. Cincinnati huge difference Columbus noticed. weekend drove banks Cincinnati wall wall people dance clubs there. mask sight. rarely see someone without mask downtown Columbus. Ever since Dewine got booed Trump rally lifted restrictions fucked. RKI links site, (as writing this) stands 7334: RKIs Page, find provided link ""COVID-19 Deutschland – häufig gefragt"" - first majority Canadians live near border, comment equally applies Americans living 12 Northern border-states.

Trivia: Buffalo New York gets snow (nearly double) Toronto Southern Ontario, lake-effect. Spreading deadly virus absolutely breaking script. damn well know I'm sure dug heels this.  good enough. people stop complying guidelines later year. live Redding it’s referred calabama rightfully  I've got barbell bunch 45's still pales comparison variation gym. example squats, going without rack? Hack squats? Yeah works everyone knows keep changing things body adapts. also sucks working dingy ass garage. garage working cars working body. go gym get motivated atmosphere... feels charged. Even days want workout know get rest takes care itself. end making ghetto squat rack milk crates though case loons close gym again. deaths definitely *all* preventable. yes, definitely all. 

And WHO, influence China, probably blame governments, since waited long, first declare PHEIC, even use word pandemic. Still wouldn’t compare Tedros Hitler. 

Also, way know final death count be. even surpasses 40 millions, still won’t appropriate compare Holocaust call genocide (unless prove someone intentionally manufactured virus).

There propaganda saying “fuck kids, little shits, it’s much fun go back work” no, people weren’t brainwashed hating wives/husbands’ guts locked 24/7 6 weeks. natural human feelings.

I won’t entertaining conversation longer, clearly weird fixation. isn’t conspiracy. Maybe you’re one who’s brainwashed. Im missing healthcare workers photos? referenced healthcare workers folks know attended practiced good social distancing mask wearing. 

Why can’t admit you’ve got concerning anger (this months ago?) people protesting support black lives?

Edit: also failed mention optics police choking another black man death video asked stop cried mother. Let’s forget context. TBF want immune system become couch potato time everyone's distanced everything's over-sanitized. dont resilience common pathogens dont exposure them.

I'll wash hands every waste dump, fundamental revulsion otherwise, I'm pumping sanitizer everywhere one touching anything someone else has. problem nobody brains wants one fight system forgo university education. shit system, jobs going test skills anything, want see degree. ""Heroes"" wear capes. wear short skirts. terrible parent would allow that!? people America still think hoax.... Smh business school, literature degree? every degree hands lab work involved. Yeah, I'm gonna argue that. basically definition skill. However, many things considered ""skills"" really belong category. They're basically low-budget skills taught couple afternoons. lot skills people might list resume much basic people realize, taught (at most) handful weeks.

Ugh...now they’re precious I’m constantly worried lose one. Sounds like re-enroll next semester. Christ ultimate superspreader Redding really trip days I’m moving Seattle area years guess irrelevant tested negative, probably false positive. Wow, detailed answer, thank you! thought traditional method specific (such using entire inactive virus - targeted using spike protein).

I suppose thought mRna vaccines targeting spike proteins, others using inactive virus. know intricacies, I'm layperson.

Too bad rid us common coronaviruses! hoping say goodbye colds! Millennials topping 40 years old now. Many jobs OK. bench 3 bills. evidence suggest persons blood type affects severity variance symptoms. 

There many studies show people type resistance less symptoms. makes sense people say “I it, bad people say” people losing sense smell dying. Maybe worlds college networking. I've spoken maybe 5 people went college past 20 years, none could help career. wonder number would like national guardian angel/protectively fairy mandate flying pig appointed ayatollah US Canada. least sweden could honest enough admit afford anything continuing manipulate public sake business interests, sick.

In way Sweden manipulate public?

Where source ""manipulation"" business interests? BLM protests Trump. That's happened. End.  Uhhh, sounds scary. he's trying get political it... He'll labelled traitor, liar, fake news spreader Trump's base says like Shhh may question government policy Merde thx  things still closed restricted here. psychotic Governor literally encouraging it. That's crazy I'm built tall guy still count ""overweight"" I'd really concerned underlying conditions actually kill people vaccinating group first foremost. Saying need vaccinate 20% population like loosely saying 20% people high chance dying virus. 100% sure, people saying given warning others say put notice leave. hope word gets never work pharma again. Please explain post anyway factually incorrect.  Please show us case widespread community transmission get middle aged elderly populations. Thanks asking. Somehow still alive doc keeps telling us ""active death"". horrible amount pain keeps asking someone help die. said want us come.  Pretty simple..treating health product right...duh Europe wearing masks cases surging. forget greed. United States government value humanity, money gained way taxes privatized healthcare. Greed corporations offshoring jobs years without penalty gutted numerous communities across states. federal government swayed corporate lobbyists public. Covid put spotlight this, always true. genocide Native Americans, slavery, mass incarnation, taboo drugs, sex, mental illness, huge deficit, big military climate change denial leaders country failed citizens. didnt never really was. Yeah that's pretty normal intramuscular injection. got fever day half felt kinda crummy. Still better getting flu. We've turned corner! virus going disappear like magic! Weird, virus exploding 3rd surge. Keep nose covered safe. Outdoors away people ok. wondering difference. thanks guess explains get you’re saying, we’re nowhere close third world country. I’ve third world country, I’m guessing haven’t. Yes, people become doctors nurses bad people, old people homes aged. /s makes sense stop assuming believe say. asked this. Toyota. law time limit approving Supreme Court Justice? listening scaremongers left want believe nothing done FDA Trump safe, pushing Biden win. truth scientists FDA either approve safe vaccine, raise holy hell anyone tries approve unsafe one. 

Trust science politics.  Ah, go back needing lurk more. research look studies. vaccine side effects severity happen right initial jab. Go look trial results. Like, seriously. Learn talking about.

Enjoy staying indoors though that's want. Capitalism know going get pulled mods. conservative trope everyone vulnerable run free without explaining:

A) define/identify vulnerable

B) actual plan would actually protect people arm pretty sore couple days lol. woke little achey next day might’ve working idk Hey there. Halfway October. Still phase 3 results read yet.

Looks like blew right past ""phase 3 August"" predictions made above. Yeah things get rough I'm afraid. Sad thing is, could technically avoid minimize it. many people care point... idiocy people always surprises me. Trump gets re-elected, there'd nowhere run! What’s happening southeast corner? drifting Rhode Island? casinos? I’m Christian involved one fastest growing churches US. fan Bethel Music know people went supernatural school ministry. leadership extremely questionable. really playing fast loose virus response, see worship leader Sean Feucht giant worship events hundreds people singing without masks, spouting “they can’t stop us worshipping” really takes wind sails. Worship home friends family. God doesn’t care. church fine online worship services small groups time being, thousands members. we’re smart everyone fine. comes shock Redding tier 4 whatever. 
Oh well. good degree took 18 months get reasonably good job 2015. prior covid economy recovering Great Recession. Considering happening much worse global, can’t imagine much worse would generation. Millennials Gen Z pretty much fucked offspring result.  That's pride, that's relief. Like car alarm going off, car battery finally dies. saying 2/3 states first wave?

Alabama? Pennsylvania? New York? world make mistake again, many societies willing take steps necessary bring virus control. see, would wearing suit pointless? right steps. know get N95 mask though. available healthcare workers? write? Thats socialism guess jumping. agree mask wearing social distancing right course action right (wish could add contact tracing that)

It’s fucking mystery That's actually well-propagated meme. Fed can't actually print money. want us believe helps goal trying spur inflation, meme. jump Fed's balance sheet large part bank reserves (outside Congress authorized actual stimulus). QE asset purchase programs actually create bank reserves (which banks actually need order lend March). ""cash"" Fed used buy debt assets sequestered special account Fed. institutions sell Fed cannot take proceeds use please. restricted account count towards reserves, access them. idea Fed letting printers run brrrrr big meme people actually understand monetary system.

QE actually deflationary low rates long term. thing help put downward pressure rates, theory supposed incentivize borrowing, real inflationary effect. money actually created printed existence, lent existence. matter many assets Fed buys, banks tightening lending standards lending, Fed stuck. Powell begging Congress spend big, way Fed actually go ""brrrr"" debt monetize...and comes Congressional budget deficits. Fed ""print"" Congress authorizes spend excess tax receipts. Congress pushes stimulus and/or banks start growing lending, Fed completely stuck pushing string unable create inflation. create certain types asset inflation means malinvestment monetary policy done stocks low rates push money riskier assets seeking return. can't flip switch create inflation, despite people trying sell gold tell you. 

It's funny, people often speak Fed print money actually help Fed mission. Fed can't people say can, perception enough fake people acting can, inflationary itself.

Considering cases risen Europe, USA sees anything similar look unrealistic all. anecdotally People Positive Confirmed Covid typically Retested (Not Covered/Clinic get paid.) Scientists generally considered pretty high priority immigrants makes current president look bad narrative media. isn’t bad. look data, reason proportion young people getting infected really high older folks protecting staying home.

Young people almost never die covid compared older ones big difference spring older people got caught guard. 

The real question is, contain spill younger generation older ones adding lag real wave coming. I'm guessing likely pretty good, they've submitted rolling reviews Canadian, Australian EU authorities already.

That's exactly doing. I've already explained that, obtuse.

Especially justified upset originally asked back fingers pointed sister BIL following proper safety pandemic putting everyone risk putting position either come find different date.

Huh. Sounds like bitching Internet ass sure keep arguing Christmas pandemic somehow normal expecting people live safely normal. Quit dishonest.

Christmas *is* normal, pandemic not. Expecting people Christmas decreed specifically not.

Again, dishonest person you. obtuse person you. person stubborn admit they're wrong you. person illiterate comprehend points made you.

I think even understand ""normal"" means.

Edit: point replying. comment history literally nothing shoving head smug little ass. honest you, struggle believing anything govt says. Around 50 million people die year. It’s sad it’s something ordinary extra 1 million die. truth is, matter advance technology scientists researchers develop. people throughout ages level incompatible intelligence understand depth problem. think physical traits might one species, juat map inferior mind people, trust millions vivid stupidity among 😂😂

What new technology actually gave people inferior mind ""an illusion satisfaction greatness"" realty hollow vessel, ""empty vessel sounds much"". ideological disbelief China anything right even something unrelated ideology. Nothings guarantee likely 400k tomorrow. Ah, greatest nightmare.

But, appreciate looked up. agree need data. encourage people wear masks? impacted personally? March right obscurity belong. 15 min up. even humble enough admit fact. 

I mean, want look weak staring death face. September, remember talking brazenly need lockdowns, social distancin, mask wearing despite death toll. justify argument saying people die part life. Doctors performed abortions people *fucking protest clinics* nerve come back keep protesting, docs cant even say anything due privacy laws. tots peas. Well someone would’ve told them! Roll tide! That's absolute bullshit I'm going 3 weeks shortness breath. steroids breathing virus, I'm ""recovered"" need use inhaler occasionally. getting better breathing still crap I'm active could weeks doctor thinks. Literally millions people suffer prolonged COVID symptoms. Checking Indiana. Folks “over” social distancing, masks, etc. Winter coming bad one.  Good luck telling Karens anti maskers everything said false? look countless studies saying reinfection rare base thoughts  fool learns mistakes, wise man learns mistakes others. Maybe president setting example responsible goes long way.  Remdesivir rushed, caught covid would pay pocket probably even symptoms. antiviral, tested bit top actual patients getting months. I've asked, told can't get remdesivir unless I'm sick hospital.

And know everyone lucky enough admitted hospital. Lots people died denied hospital bed. 

Glad getting better case 1 scientific study. work. Consumers default easiest options can't shop person buy easiest place online. government chose shut portions economy basically gave large online retailers free bonus. Even actual vaccine, little chance robust immune response would generated everyone. restaurants don’t be.

Vancouver summer busy restaurants empty tables tables usually plexiglass tables —

— almost notable spreading linked restaurants 

(sometimes get warnings cuz employee test positive part recent 2nd wave seems linked gatherings homes non-service industry venues)

restaurants remain busy. downtown busy every weekend. construction sites never ever close — even April, obvs Vancouver booming construction locale. clubs also open summer recently — little spreading linked ..... clubs recently closed restaurants given midnight curfew caution undocumented cases among young ppl may spreading.

But least far confirmed, Van still pretty low virus cases basically 0 deaths non seniors - single death 50 2 50. low cases US/EU standards.

so restaurants danger clearly relatively safe way based Vancouver

....for it’s worth, delivery exploded tho too. many condos constant stream doordash, etc guys lol .... masks pretty common. majority ppl don’t wear restaurants majority seem day going work/on transit. feel sorry responders trying stay safe.

It's literally subtitle. anything folks complain about? good point! try make point use hand sanitizer touch mask face adjust. Yeah 100% don’t support idea trying herd immunity, it’s murder.

Point is, they're gonna kill themselves, gonna kill granny Yes, 220K ""reported"" covid-deads also. hospitals fully overloaded, would happen herd-immunity 'strategy'. would complete breakdown healthcare result higher fatality rate covid, also higher fatality rate everything else HEALTHCARE. Honestly, bodies piling front hospitals result complete riots complete breakdown society also. retarded idea would possibly lead civil war. Someone explain stupid, reach heard immunity virus anti bodies last 3-5 months? wow, that's like one day traffic accidents Kids collapse die playing sports heart conditions didn’t know time, without covid. Well context catastrophic costs mitigation efforts entail (which fail anyway), illogical inhumane otherwise New York State Resident, feel much safer right going Canada, cases starting rise again. I'll happy staying right am. Plus 99% Canada nothing anyways especially winter season coming E R E high number undetected cases ~ 6 months ago means also know common reinfection is.

We can't assume people infected early protected.  US ""best prepared""? counting, number doctors hospital beds? 

Is report counting e.g. robust sick-leave system, robust health insurance system, good population health, high trust authorities, scientific literacy/trust science?

These things take ton preparation. Decades generations. Writing ""meh, that's cultural"" really fails appreciate actual resilience preparedness is. This. People US still living 60s thinking US end all. declined considerably past decades trail many countries many things. cities empty, [actually plan instead letting random sprawl happen. Soooo that's Trump ment said virus gonna disappear April. Thank you, too! want ok, also. I'm afraid people probably end getting virus point, case best healthy can.

He put economy human lives. That's unacceptable. could sarcastic also true. even countries like germany fail others chance (not saying best) See, that's think people psychopaths. ""We write off"" compute me. disgusting anybody could ever able think like that. York trying something novel American city pandemic: allowing reopenings areas shutting businesses schools blocks away. really weird European leadership awol. Trump administration: „Go herd immunity!“

Scientists: „We don‘t know long term effects. know antibodies created gone early weeks. need time assess further. first confirmed case second infection ending deadly, 60 days first infection.“

Trump administration: „Herd immunity!!!“

It‘s stupid, physically hurts. biggest league college football postponed two games week seen sport’s famous coach enter isolation testing positive coronavirus. Again, youre completely wrong here. 8 233 3.4%. CDC estimates show hospitalization rates 5-15%. anything skewed toward lower severity. repeat opiniin many times want believe representative, facts show that, anything, rosey scenario.

I'm symptoms changing major ""flaw."". That's exactly happens course disease. expected. 

It seems like picking random completely reasonable results, writing bunch bullet points, saying, ""Hmm, looks fishy!"". Except doesn't.

You've named two ""flaws."". error. sure talking about. United Airlines trying drum business new *fear flying.* talking about?  nothing like near me. basically back relative normalcy south east Queensland, Australia. Same. husband works place warehouse known Covid positives. Hm.... ok biggest one day increase happen time? France, Germany, Italy(?),  conned Big Pharma.

And Fauci praise Remdesivir. think that’s meant #2 there. yeah way we’d reach 9mil dead would period many years reinfection would serious problem (which yet there’s indication that’s case). common border hundreds miles long

But handful border crossings. know. 

But strongly suspect people would consider ""teenager died pandemic"" fulfilling life. Wow, seems Covid weakening. reason would believe frequent websites nowhere near. Sweden spared way. Sweden 5918 dead population 10.2 million.

Looking new spike cases:

Sweden \[5918 dead\] average 600-700 cases/day 

Norway \[278 dead\] average 150 cases/day

Denmark \[677 dead\] average 400 cases/day

Finland \[351 dead\] average 200-250 cases/day

In universe better Sweden four nations around us ? Please tell ?? spike looks exactly nordic countries. Ok post links. correct protecting vulnerable difficult thing scenario. 

But since dead include ~0.2% population (mostly old severely sick remaining years), here's something do: write move on.

When compare cost shutting 330MM people two years (a sacrifice 5% average everyone's remaining lives), clear laissez faire approach rational, pain-minimizing option evne though impolite say so.

2. Lack high percentage caring public willing make sacrifices good others.

No, look closer - 2.56 millions ""Lower respiratory **infections**"". Non-communicable things, like COPD, asthma etc ""Respiratory diseases"" Second wave began october? Spain shit since July. Netherlands since late August, France early August.. say go it. body needs anyway cheap. promises covid. Hundred year old women may sniffles days personal trainers need ventilated. Sadly, believe everyone eventually virus. would say already infected, prepare much possible losing excess weight eating healthily possible come, better chance. blessed good shape going covid, knocked ground almost killed one gym rat friends, take lightly. good chance survival people seem recover, one infected gets unscathed way, seems. damage physical covid definitely change you. know reddit known spirituality, found faith God amidst suffering. Covid definitely change you, better worse. Maybe global rate, AZ holding 2.1% NY 10% one point.

Trying crunch data right like arson report structure still fire. downplaying numbers, incorrect counts inability parts world produce accurate data may time smoke clears enough get solid picture. yes me, getting isolate little difficult...i’m going ask isolate fully. ban gathering effective immediately upon announcement. Otherwise party promotion. worry, I'm sure died, congress support survivors. IHME model pretty unreliable, it? Seems like various times significantly underestimated overestimated predictions. Saint Louis City ok, I’m still sending kids back classroom yet. city schools started hybrid learning, rural parts state raging, everyone wants go goddamn pumpkin patches. definitely uprise. taking measures get back control. surprise though, waiting second wave. still manageable phase working together get handle it. shouldn’t getting flu shots early. typically becomes ineffective within 3-4 months really want effective December-January (peak flu season). campaign get shots thought all.   Even worse Israel had. name Donald Trump. cares nobody himself. Europeans completely forget Corona?

What? American platform, majority users comes US, UK, European countries like Germany, Netherlands, Belgium more. gonna hear Americans more?

In March/April corona new everyone checking every ressource constantly. March/April anymore. We're currently lockdown wondering shit taking us. 15th dealiest disease outbreak last 1000 years 13th deadliest last 500 years.

Thank helping us keep information /r/Coronavirus reliable!


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* thought politics weren’t allowed coronavirus thread. Yet it’s title article. article politics Covid.

I think it’s official. Coronavirus political thing.  recall read this, consider empty beds instead total beds, US compares even worse.

I think well prepared sense got ""heads up"" Europe. really important factor talking exponential growth. Acting late quickly deplete healthcare systems resources. Mitigating actions need taken matter many beds available. bumped lady walking fast grocery store. apologized wearing face shield. immediately imagined droplets dropping vertically onto arm. 

I sure paranoid bathing arm hand sanitizer, turns out, brain excellent droplet simulator. continue rise, slower. already countries deaths first wave, e. g. Russia, Romania, Ukraine, Czechia, Poland. means different things different people. Everyone different positions economically different goals. I'm trying give specific advice, rather make people sober picture next years get houses order best see fit. I'm selling anything services. feel terrible people led believe one thing get blindsided suffer it. looking plan next years, make based assumption rebounding economically anytime soon. Plan though something worse 2008-2010 currently unfolding. Remember, crisis 2008 happen overnight. unfolded waves fits starts. first wave, stimulus eviction moratoriums masked pain taken edge off. ironically, like drug initially makes things easier deal with, later makes problem worse. 

Anyway, I'm trying ramble. would say plan future big decisions financial planning around idea descent rebound order better protect family. think people discussing Sweden right now. fairly well compared rest Europe.

The past discussed much, yet people keep bringing time like something new. something personal towards though, might new Swedish treads. use dawn dish detergent. soap kills 99.9% virus Thank sourcing claims. got swept fearmongering one hand, second wave despite mask regulations other. R0 3-5 see masks alone stop it. Basically plan. long everyone coming page don’t see issue.   first wave short duration harsh lockdown less diffuse spreading. exponential growth longer period without lockdown continue grow. Natural selection means people vulnerable disease longer reproduce hardy enough resist survive

Natural selection takes hundreds generations occur; something low mortality rate COVID mostly kills people already kids, might natural selection all. No, don’t trust Trump. don’t trust Biden either. 

I bet can’t fathom fact don’t trust politicians. 🙃 Conspiracy theories aside, hospital billing actually surrealistic kabuki dance medical practice, insurance, medicare, IRS. 

This anecdote untrue, plausible, given general absurdity medical reimbursement US. would least serve fertilizer.... Lol hi sheep - 218k fake number - cc admitted 6% straight Covid butt old people - hellllllo wake ! It’s overblown!!!! Nothing says isn’t happening, think it’s bad that.

Detaining people simply religion wrong country, time history, wether it’s 5* hotel dungeon.  far right appropriating Norse symbolism makes find putting unfortunately tendency ruin everything. Source? cuckdown (along simple natural selection)

Natural selection takes hundreds generations occur; something low mortality rate COVID mostly kills people already kids, might natural selection all. don’t choose one let others drop though. start use whichever vaccine safely available. Even 100m doses would greatly help. Morons

That’s acceptable answer Simple blame lies 100% Donald Judas Trump! spread March located like Bergamo Heinsberg. much diffuse. imagine. Also can't continue something doing.

Lockdown skeptics fighting something even happening. say outrageous things like one allowed see another person, locked homes. lies.

This recent comment shows part group. jo20.com massive trump US best finding new treatment vaccine new virus, slowing spread highly contagious virus never US' best never will, US always need keep everything open let people choose actions towards virus. can't find clear answer question online hoping someone might help:

How long take virus, moment infection, become visible system? i.e. long shows test?

I asking symptoms. thought read less 20% US contracted Covid year. anything could read says otherwise? Perhaps looking reports prevalence NYC estimated 25% peak

Had seen that, that's I'd expect outbreak scale NYC. Yep. Rural areas getting slammed. Lost dad last week, mom, brother, sister law infected, maybe kids. Wear masks, people highest number ever, sure OP got April 29 from. “Sorry Mildred, you’re one ten person limit. slammer.” yep. friend literally believes every doctor, administrator, coroner, funeral home director cahoots increase death totals ""Freedom"" longer true Germany, average age infected rises 1 year per week. Population 60 sees increase too. trump Strange youre Sweden havent heard concern government experts ..

Here's link PM couple weeks ago telling people work home and, despite youre claiming thread, avoid large Tegnell expressing concern rising cases elderly homes couple days article Tegnell says new spikes sign second wave- admits rise cases needs taken saying y'all dead water, human behavior driving force spread, time let guard down. That's say hermit. upstate NY damn near everything open. small get togethers family friends socially distance. stay diligent. That's im saying, rising numbers concern... Right? Wtf this.. 

Utilitarianism good philosophical justification precisely reason.. like 101 stuff.. Modern thought moved on.. leg stand on.. Pathetic. 

Also little lower point Guns, Germs, Steel great book source ideas lol.. Like sure, entertaining fun new POV, ain't serious academics view much truth.. Christ almighty.. people want badly special . 

Also, like.. quick question scientists accepted knowledge, accepts economic social systems without deeper examination. Maybe fact economic social systems can't handle pandemic indictment scientists.. Maybe US prepared anything all? 

Big words patriotism really good shields coronavirus. Czechs Europe getting taste second wave. True, US really even stop first wave that's miracle moron dictature.

Just imagine different situation: huge disaster sweeps half US ground. visible, visit place, still millions idiots half claiming fake news. Humanity great. Sometimes disregard courts certain national crises ...like Lincoln ignoring Supreme Court Civil War. remember, often coming people call ""pro-life"". South America? One person decided knew epidemiology medicine anyone else, relentlessly made political issue. closeted gay person different openly gay son brother. closeted gay person still repress side themselves, feel shameful pretend vice struggle with, like alcoholism. gay son, choice face reality accept lose whole relationship. guess Trump hit max pocket year, he's got going him. Gotta wonder many baby Trumps would been. Hi Dana, I'm facing similar dilemma. me, cost issue (my insurance covers it), I'm lucky enough work home. never go out. people live already taken flu shot.

So since there's almost zero chance catching flu, I'm sure risk going possibly germ/covid infested place (like CVS Walgreens) get flu shot.

Wondering came decision. Yeah sounds legit.

Wear masks believers BS.

Or use eyeballs, rather believing Mainstream Media, like Reddit, figure something else.  live 45 minutes away KC saying things 'fine' basically like meme everything fire cartoon dog 'This fine.' thought bubble. town ~1000 new cases past two weeks community 80,000. ~2000 cases total that. Things 'fine'. thought affected fat people. Oh.. wait.. comments add zero discussion. furlough first. sister furloughed job related hotel events week, permanently laid people off.   Covid never eradicated. likely anyways.

What saying anything pretty much every virologist epidemiologist saying right now.

Just vaccine widely available mean caution still needed. possible things go back normal, jumping right things right away could huge disaster especially questionable efficacy.

And sterilizing immunity virus last. already know that. antibodies fade. whether immune defense mechanisms like cells B cells reduce severity greatly point problem another story. sterilizing immunity lasts 6-24 months coronaviruses, reason think one follow others. idea herd immunity kind crock. Herd immunity achieved large scale quickly vaccination. knowing know coronaviruses, vaccination probably way possible time future. never gained herd immunity OC43, HKU-I, coronaviruses circulate. They're less severe compared first came around (they think OC43 caused 1889 Russian Flu Epidemic, misdiagnosed flu, genetic tracing shows jumped cows humans region around then) we've decades time mutate downwards immune systems learn combat ways. never gained herd immunity them, that's coronaviruses work know.

What comes know enough. Even vaccine trials may know safety, wide margin error efficacy. Especially vaccines less effective risk groups expected, could really lead trouble.

Once vaccine available, that's time get vaccinated, still show caution. Make sure they're working, find one(s) get pulled, etc... time throw caution wind pack stadiums right away. That's crazy. want things return normal, safe, especially risk groups. know right away. take months wide vaccination really see we're at. get wisest choice, six months gym, miserable. I'll accept risks, mitigate best can. least Rogue makes barbells 45s. Antibodies produced vaccination likely last much longer 6 months. Dude would wish covid anyone. Christie inveterate asshole Bridgegate proportions whose intellect much reminds Peter's Law.    affects personally, different. civil ban you! Fucking fascists reddit I'll one better, probably reason anti-gay

It's like ""god hates fags"" people. They're trying pray gay away. people spend time thinking butt fucking Andy Dick. Trump took, along couple things, better days? Compared death rate spring, things drastically better. know reading reddit. That's we're best world dunno Ben, husband Shelby Parker, also filled grief is, relief. opinion relevant, says something relationship maybe sexist one-sided article.  Goes back least disappointing takes develop empathy, also... Better figure eventually rather continue double deny (like Trump). Right conservatives zero issue stem cell research never have. objected harvesting fetal stem cells... find comical left things pointing difference jumping hoops.  many metro hospitals city? Eight seems like lot. Curve flattening talk __after__ election day. pretend everything trending right direction regardless realities ground. Haven’t read article yet, looking thumbnail would like know two nine people pictured wearing masks? makes sense me. Please help understand.

smh Chris Christie hero want he’s republican available. I'm sinus head pressure today can't tell sinus headache covidache. found inflammation, like sugar, alcohol, hard exercise could cause ugly flare-ups. veins, like vasculitis. Thankfully hit lungs hard, still breathe, get random lung pains soreness. feel best eating low inflammation food like omegas threes, complex carbs like beans oatmeal fruits vegetables. Honey hit hard much junk food makes feel off. I'm blessed still standing. want details, let know. important learn other.   Hah! sure walls get build election.

However, Trump manage win election, might go quickly. Chris Christie Covid bad enough sent ICU. mean definitely lung damage? already asthma. Nothing survivors, hell country run people old enough survived polio? Thing is, thinks he's hiding well. basically everything science predicted happening happening time going lockdown seems US wants quietly ignore things going worse April. private businesses get decide, almost enforced without issue. 
Room ventilation bigger issue masks moment, especially big cities space limited. get worse winter coming (no open windows). Meh, he’s still lacking courage actually name persons problem. doesn’t belong sides. comparing current death rate previous death rate April disingenuous. night day difference. Oof.

[MO shows KC area 200 ICU beds available. time mutation appear makes vaccines we've working useless. loser say something dumb I’m sure nothing big fat ass... I'm sure guts concealing advocacy loosening restrictions specious plea take seriously bare minimum. compromised preemption kind increased restrictions states consider, might somewhat sympathetic crow tastes.  comments add zero discussion. know job used covid restaurant closures opportunity clean house. hope mind eating food cooked chefs restaurant, ever.  ""I abortion 15 year old daughter got knocked up. secretly got abortion I'm still nobody ever find out."" second wave new people getting infected time people got early (March-April) able infected could disaster worse we've seen far. good abortion abortion immortalized cell line harvested aborted fetus 1973 thing stem cell research.

You're absolutely right; technically kidney cells, stem cells. 

That's particularly relevant actual grounds they've opposed even prohibited stem cell research on, though. I've Toronto work weather beautiful high like 70°F 50s night. J
Trees beautiful colors. Honestly gorgeous weather. wish could actually go enjoy weather rather essentially chained job site hotel fuck Covid  Check MAPCS Athersys...

Adult derived cells, FDA fast tracked drug ARDS, major killer covid. think different - don’t think bonkers estimate “2 weeks flatten curve”. Fauci knows much vaccines do. Even it’s months, we’re moving right direction. They're literally even remotely scientifically policy wise. mental gymnastics I'm doing, like 6 month baby rolling first time, cause basic science.  What? They're clarifying, mental gymnastics so. Republicans: ""we wrong, wear mask. Trump bad choice""

US: 4 years late. Next! Well, always.. Lindsey Graham still antigay, despite closet.  extremely hypocritical. done illegal makes okay religious folks republicans? Turtles polio?  McConnell doesn’t want McConnell die. doesn’t care do. father law taken telling people ""take damn thing going wear right!!"" 

He's old Navy Seabee care people's opinions matter. Rules rules! he's going tell them. 

I desperately wish wouldn't. even need 2 week quarantine anymore upon arrival, bring negative test proof upon arrival. Mind you, still need quarantine come home. real forget add /s end text? Relax, Easter.  form research also illicit either anyone reading. embryonic stem cells. Nobody likes wrong, duh.

But takes guts admit wrong afraid response get. Oh yes. Lovely cramped indoors. many friends due April... discussion took philosophical turn. Case point, harvest stem cells living person grow outside body, inject back person. science come long way since thought could get fetuses. like kitchen full people, touching stove. time turn stove, he's seen 50 people touch stove, burn hands, say stove hot. guy fixes stoves said hey, stove works, hot. guy went school stoves. lard lad failed sopranos extra looking dumbass still walks touches it, proclaims entire room people burnt hands ""hey, stove hot"" Exactly, especially none two good position lecture  Even ""good"", per se, prayed god forgiveness, did

1sr really sucks 2nd, opsec 38th life expectancy birth (78.9). Lebanon. so-called peer countries 80s, including Canada 82.3. China GNI US even lower life expectancy. 

India also ranks high GNI, Russia. life expectancies 69.4 72.4, respectively. life great you’re top ten percent, that’s would measure well country doing. 

So we’re third world, we’re near bottom first world quality life measures. shitload ultra wealthy people skew numbers make things look better really are. ...Ladybugs... gsp 39 rn 40 match ever happens next year. don’t think aging gsp beat prime Khabib.

She’s one least empathetic people know. PULLED GUUUN “214k dead? Meh. sick? Please wear mask” - Fat Politician probably Americans: nah came it, theres way trump recovered 2 days. shit horrible Lol massive girth. nice warn us CAD Diabetes let go. McConnell scowls. Serious question- know people reinfected virus. reinfected, stronger immune system response? He's stupid. plays one TV. 

Which arguably worse lol vaccine polio 1955, really long ago, widespread vaccination likely happen till 60s. mistress.  still convinced anyone thinks gay choice secretly gay. ""well, \*i\* chose gay, too"".  agree. Yeah, he’s late party, better late never. guess plenty time think screwed didn’t decency call let know might it. Phenomenal, AJ Styles There's Rand Paul, one people insists socialized medicine US would degrade quality care, destroy private practice, lead long waits running ass Canada go private hospital save story usually gets wrong says Paul used public health care system Canada, imo, much worse typical arguments he's choosing private medicine within socialized health care system Canada, implies would available US adopted system. Further, went first place US medical care extremely expensive (because system, defends, sucks).  type parents try force whoever boy form lifelong relationship / marriage daughter almost worse.

The older get, older seem keep setting bar old woman/man child.

A high school kid fit parent. Almost everyone gets remdesivir gets late, I'm pretty sure studies shown helps given early, like Trump Christie got it, death bed. actually asked doctor this, since problem paying cash it, said can't get I'm sick hospital. Finally someone says it. It’s fault voting sub ran people moderating, it’s less Reddit individual mods. banned r/politics saying “god good” that’s it. People’s egos trip. would totally natural expected India far faster greater spread US, due population density. quite feat country managed dumb enough so, sick compared country 4x population fraction tax revenue. recall properly, leading vaccines targeting spike protein, (some using traditional means). Many vaccines require second shot two weeks first one. presume prime immune system since we've never virus before.

I wondering though.. endemic coronaviruses cause colds also spike protein. vaccine potentially stop colds caused coronaviruses? Obviously ""colds"" caused viruses too, unaffected however. Well shit, who's going infect casket? sad downvoted that. Indeed, timelines changed lot along way, probably still will. Browsing old discussions topic eye-opening. sees benefits masks! guess it’s better never, least survived. following progress (little bit information released) felt always going vulnerable given pre-existing health conditions. 

Maybe also see light tRump support Biden.. He’s probably anti casket find odd us still really high number. averaging 2k+ peaked deaths still seeing 1000+ understanding virus better treatments Right... also happened Italy Spain currently huge second waves. NY's response clearly nothing success since first wave started anyone knew virus reached us. urges everyone wear mask lol Nicely said. PLEASE wear damn mask navigate this. Chris, don’t get advocate masks demand reopening. Masks *part* solution. Hospitals aren’t packed though. Like even close. Japan, country 120 million, everything open. Everything. Bars, restaurants, amusement parks, concert venues, name it. 

Current cases? 8,000. 

Know Japanese good about? Wearing masks. 

I’m horrified American family friends back I’m terrified for. numbers atrocious. government done nothing. Even foreign-owned businesses foreign residents got relief checks peak. 

Be responsible folks. urged businesses go curbside pickup early duration pandemic set program get business online necessary.

Those without internet access still call fax orders.

How much would negated need PPP?

Edit: Another thought. government could set nationalized Instacart/Grubhub/Postmates/etc. alternative businesses could enter free access consumer (no service fees) would paid small corporate tax increase.

This could chance local businesses equal online playing field national corporations franchises. Liberace better hiding it. This.  True member Q(ueer) anon Lucky guy, basic barbell weight package 600-2000 dollars, find right now. still scary, he’s woods yet. people willing go 100 person spin class?  Ah yes, Reddit™, come 100% serious, topic discussion cannot use sarcasm make jokes. definitely doesn’t know. don’t even understand article this. guys always abortions poor minorities. One ways keep certain classes down. Christ man. Imagine else hear about. Yeah gladly grind mask dirt kissing random stranger mouth vaccinated. Link's right now, stfu, seriously. Stfu. like think antigay gay combined explode like matter antimatter beautiful rainbow filled unicorns peppermint farts fuck talking about? China's poverty rate 0.7% mongoloid 😂😂😂  might cynical view point, i’ve found people won’t show empathy it’s late affected first hand worry, anti-vaccine rhetoric, may live world young people survive polio again. Evangelicals highest rate... Well well. anymore. us well long time. live states. late.  220,000 people late. absolution him. I'm glad survived decency admit wrong. This, problem 200 million Americans dead, long owns Libtards. ordered Russian handlers. 200 million dead small price pay Russian aluminum plant. Genuine question, single person publicly even wish well?? PRESIDENT, probably got sick first place even?? Abortion punished death penalty, unless mistress, case mandatory. That’s true experience too. It’s disappointing realize neighbor coworker family member really doesn’t care anything anyone outside self-interest. think eat much pizza? easy thing know politically expedient choose something else know A) wealth influence allow B) lie incongruent actions somehow ultimately valid stopped *other* people thing.

I think takes degree bravery admit consequence ignored minimized happened, hope makes someone like think twice next time go similar path.

One hope. Fuck around end many people recovered infection rate drops like rock? cares. Sick cowardly absolutely inhuman narcissism. Lmao know talking about, weights really expensive, almost everywhere sold out. people struggle keep motivated home, hence people leave comfort home exercise. Similar studying library. everyone content dumbbell exercises jumping rope. much might hate McConnell, he's foolish. U! S! A! also iron lung child.  He's gay bag turtle doves. Lovely. get 10% credit due political bravado. this, bridge transition fuckup believe you’ve struck out. fact Trump get monoclonal antibodies us regular citizens cannot fucked up.

Especially actions directly contributed many people getting disease dying.

Death powerless, seems. people country don’t vote out. lol, that's *post-hoc* rationalization I've ever see one. Maybe Americans Europeans similar think? “But I’m Cheerleader!” vibes Lol he's avoiding DC like rat would abandon sinking ship. That’s less vial prized horse semen... I’ll take 2 get colds again, think long-term immunity really possible. something live with. tiny part population, virus dangerous rest it'll nothing another cold virus long-term immunity possible. things, strategy humans evolution. It’s going way polio measles, get vaccine, case closed, it’s done. It’s going public-health measures linger months months.

Look, everybody. Even vaccine Spring/Summer 2021, Dr. Fauci says need wear masks distance. know you, I'm going that. hope soon people stop treating friends/family/co-workers like this. mean, come on. chances corona right infect even sick? Stop treating people badly dont wanna live fear answer, might well said matter many people die lifestyle. current massive increases virus cases area I'm considering full tyvek suit go full face respirator. antimasker gives shit/gets close I'll tell need get vote cast quick I'm break job cleaning COVID wards local hospital... don’t know prepared. didn’t care. Honestly, would risk life suffer hard economic times. wild guess-  people France thrilled fewer Americans country days? seriously want know, see money spend would missed culture would think French enjoying break. disagree 

This American public we're talking about. article assumes average person okay hermit germaphobe. vaccine arrives, public appetite lockdowns/restrictions gone. People going want continue 8th generation vaccine arrives. 

Hell even outside Reddit people know ignoring restrictions outside wearing masks store. visiting friends relatives social distancing masks. still see large groups kids wandering around malls areas. next year, little political keep restrictions. Americans going tolerate never ending restrictions 2025. 




Also average American short memory. 2008 Recession change public attitude overall. People still kids afford jobs feast famine. 

I really understand pundits keeping moving return normal dates back further. Nicholas Christakis wants shut he's free so. However, rest us want return normal life go sporting events.

 feel like one people site want work home forever never see coworkers. right, think ever saw 90%+ ethanol sold consumers.  
Isopropyl 90%+ super common stores used electronics similar cleaning. Give clue, name starts Depends state in. states still 25% positive. absolutely clear data fall wave started. Lies. Herd immunity always goal. That's Tegnell Giesecke stop talking made immunity numbers half year. Norbottens län get sossememo said openly they're going herd immunity. Tegnell let go flu models, wanted corona wash Swedes.

That's Sweden's strategy much worse Norway's, compared Denmark Finland. sub reputation? Excuse contact Lancet NEJM tell prime mover coronavirus information daily discussion thread getting downvotes Europe also going bars restaurants. u upped ur testing 25% positivity rate stayed same, thats good CDC responsible millions lives, normal PR gig? Article title asking shit like it’s goddamned bright orange fucking obvious entirely conceivable look who's charge. what's plan? Finger pointing burials? would done differently? Biden called trump xenophobic stopping travel China.  think panel international health experts would considered that. health insurance execs sucking good job they're doing. Let's leave blame lies: incompetent administration selfish individuals refuse even mildest sacrifice fellow citizens. golf buddy's product. Remdesivir beeb commons getting primary part treatment places, understand. Hey again.

I see switching narratives since last spoke.

Starting get sweaty election draws near, huh?

Just thought would let know Florida officially past Michigan death rate.

Keep spinning lies till puke :) normal poverty rate swung 12-15.5% last 50 years. “only” 17% pandemic seems decent me. 

As unemployment continues fall poverty rate return mean. Yes actually create contracts. appear thin air. First, Obama-era pandemic team would exist likely stockpile PPE (Trump dismantled it). Second, presidents (not Trump) actually read daily briefings. Third, presidents (not Trump) value unity would turn situation affects whole country partisan issue. president would led example worn mask, rather drawing political line (because dismantled mechanism could stockpile PPE) insinuating violation rights necessary keep us safe. mandate would never consideration decent leader. states told well month ago distribution plans ready Nov 1. 

The Army going vaccinating everyone, never plan lol wall Mexico supposed pay for? Hmmmmm. Something amiss here. say enforceable, yet confirm fining crap idiots here. Step bus/train without mask? That's €250. get tested returning red zone? €4000 2.7% chance death, we'll deal it. trick question? essentially Swedish approach.

Which produced one world's highest fatality rates.

And Sweden's economy also toilet.

Of course, Swedish defense team arrive show fatality rate 12 times higher Norway kind great achievement proves Norway undercounting factor 12. agree you’re saying. vacationers decided vacation state midst pandemic surge. We’ve got threads like r/coronanetherlands. Every time check one read Fauci said many new cases Wyoming has... Blame politics games play gain power. Two parties fight distract everyone notice actually working us. Yeah really hope he's playing safe good luck telling vaccinated people wear mask social distance going Spring/Summer 2021  flew today (and back apparently) One word: leadership. time buy toilet paper US equipment task, highest GDP buying supplies, shitload soft power. used hand virus W Exactly. resulting even mild infection seem resemble co-morbidities associated worse outcomes. Hopefully reinfection happens infrequently (though see absolutely reason assume so) majority us able mount immune response sufficient significantly attenuate second infection (which also seems unwise assume). Otherwise I’m afraid, many us seem continue trouble navigating ambiguities, may, point future, find battling waves reinfections, which, point, think probably assume likely severe. trolling right ? Deja vu literally means 'already seen' French Except 5.4%, several weeks ago 4%. makes insanity. already know spend money quarantine people. absolutely go along reducing restrictions given excuse. 

We're offered false bargain. plan protect people. plan take away restrictions protect rationale mitigations figured road. way WH deals healthcare. Break throw hands whatever comes live alone, work home, wear masks religiously, social distance better most. 

You're arguing letting burn healthy population. you. yep, benefited public schools get education parents paid taxes, given makes working he's getting benefit roads government service he's giving, etc etc Bad leadership.

The trump admin profiteering exploiting states citizens expense? must joking I'm saying going get bad. I'm saying Europe likely comparatively worse shape going fall/winter. yog. 8 million confirmed cases. don’t catch infections tests though. We’ve done antibody studies suggest around 40 million Americans infected. best estimates around .5% lethality rate, 2.6% Erm.. holidays Greece since August! still Greece vacations go twice months? Good, could get employees wear masks properly THAT'D GREAT per capita us still cases

but yeah eu's getting hit hard. Either way im lockdown quarantine bullshit much longer.

Fuck Two simple reasons

Hey look, another bullshit doom model. Straight top go... It’s undermining citizens Shockingly pandemic yet. sick seeing crap. cannot yet say felt pandemic worse best yet.

We know yet. worlds best prepared nation many uninsured underinsured? NEVER position take care everyone sadly situation proved it. 100%! lot people complaining response pandemic ""killed economy"", reality made inevitable collapses economy arrive faster. braindead conspiracy theorist, hilarious.

Get psychiatric help.  amazing Americans still thinking best place, failures every level Trump Great documentary. Highlights accessible way I've telling friends family years. dismiss noise. like climate change deniers, flat-earthers anti-vaxers playbook coronavirus mentioned.

Coronaviruses large family viruses usually cause mild moderate upper-respiratory tract illnesses.  

At time earlier pandemic playbooks, virus lethal covid-19 known realized something like could certainly happen.  

This current administration tossed playbook hoped would help politicially affecting states blue people. fuck Maybe, maybe, leaders federal level took seriously didn’t politicize it, maybe people wouldn’t acting like that.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* fatality rate. cannot divide number deaths number cases. honestly think people ""positive"" ones tested? jfc

this basic shit. amazing sub lets bullshit fly patriots thought wearing simple face covering infringed liberty continue walk around mask take chances. watch death rate soar. think count deaths much. That’s easy, tell exactly ""spiraled almost conceivable failure""

We government split middle, divided upon side's goal make life harder side. Zero cooperation, zero collaboration, 100% ham-fisted posturing finger pointing.

We leader whose main interest propping reelection. interested Twitter thinks inane posts public affected day day.

It's embarrassing. pitiful.

Edit: also, gonna sell ""best prepared nation"" thing cause I'm convinced. idea think US best prepared. I'd argue say Asian countries best prepared deal SARS fallout learnt lessons that. 

Look Taiwan, South Korea, Japan. Everything control light years ahead western world's pandemic response. 

Sure people love rag US Europe great right second wave. excuse? Actually helps passing out, black blood taken tell need lay blood drawn I'm good walk away soon needles out. I'll link article it. GOP (Greedy Oppressive Plutocrats). Period. say side screwed prior this, sometimes horrible consequences. But, level hate back forth right really time high. see families refusing speak other. Random people getting fights wearing mask, really side picking. bad nationwide.

I've read McCarthyism, feels like US level beyond right now. kind person thinks draw conclusions looking countrywide numbers 3.8 million square foot landmass, sure.

No state even meaningful second wave. New York New Jersey March/April wave barely blipped now, positivity percentage remained flat. spread virus meaningfully different in, say, August, we're getting better find cases.

Florida peaked June basically flattened out. places spiking right (like Wisconsin) first wave. no, /u/Fatwhale said, reddit still pretty much entirely US centric.

So america got hit virus many american redditors joined sub pretty much drowned non-us threads ever since.

The rest world forgotten it, get news outside reddit.

Btw also hopefully important lesson lurkers well, reddit always specific bubble we're in.

Just see something **a lot** reddit mean popular think is, lack appearance mean popular.

Something randomly pops head tv shows millions millions viewers really get mentioned reddit all, like big bang theory NCIS show regularly 30-50+million views, yet mention reddit whatsoever. think saw opposite over, USA prepared pandemic... I'm noticing too. wonder them. Perhaps inflammation? hope related micro thrombosis endothelial damage.  Germany, new law implement remote work days per year failed. Forgot one thing formula: Total breakdown healthcare system. Think happened Wuhan, Madrid, Lombardy virus able spread freely less one month. Dunno. dumb people follow plans smarter people. 

Now vain, narcissistic, corrupt, profit seeking dumbasses? herd immunity Sweden, huh? FDA requiring 2 months follow too. banned per se, teachers enforce belong risk group get attest. frowned many students dind´t learn much home schooling, much needed repeated class. implying Sweden heard immunity strategy wrong. please stop spreading dangerous myth. far right using push heard immunity strategy US Swedens numbers looking better. Tyrannical RACIST Ugly Motha Fucka (emphasis racist) It’s Tengell’s ego getting way what’s right imo

I think Tegnell much power alone. He's man front, he's dictator  screw everything touch. also value money Americans. wonder evangelicals cheering since pandemic plague would part end world? mean Pence put charge response all. virus people suffer consequences things didn’t do, remember we’re talking virus cognition therefore sense justice Americans raised independent personally responsible. 

This lie big portion Americans love tell themselves. ""Personal responsibility"" way saying ""When get mine, want able tell go piss rope."" Personal responsibility means understanding responsible things wish claim, things result actions, things required make actions happen first place.

These people throw tantrums mere _suggestion_ spending infrastructure many live virtue _absolutely colossal_ social programs yesteryear never commercially viable, necessary develop country. people absolutely trash waterways fertilizers pesticides name increasing yield, gladly claim profit, shrug claim someone else's problem mess wrecks shit downstream.

The idea American exceptionalism half problem America, we're going exceptionally fucked average Joe stop buying line BS. Me, nothing I've following epidemiologists proposing, aka distanciation, masks avoiding crowded places. There's efforts government mandate they've often spread bullshit actively harmful efforts controlling spread.

Actually implement nationwide mandate use masks, distanciation prevent crowds. guidelines place situations unavoidable(like screen cashiers customers coworkers since distanciation can't maintained). love all, stop saying virus basically nothing ignore it.   trump don´t plan home schooling Germany, bad experience, many students problems much things needed repeated class.  western world obsessed comparisons New Zealand Sweden, meanwhile Asia virus never big issue. Reminds Voldemor* finished takeover ministry magic imbecile running country What? dumber dirt crowd, Russia, Greed Avarice Society voted rabid monkey leader ftee world. benefitted stopped Swamp Thing impeached (cause guilty?) This. People US still living 60s thinking US end all. 





I think could argued U.S. nations still floating backs gains 19th 20th century imperialism conflict rather winning genuine competition potential rivals. average American proven harder working clever people South Korea, Japan, China instance. economist said regarding economical behavior four types countries: developed, developing, Japan Argentina.

It seems something similar happens pandemic. think it’s always possible make coronavirus vaccines mutations, seasonal variation short-lasting immunity considered worth effort fight simple colds.  coronavirus kills lots people incubation , people spread lot showing symptoms. 

It’s different level priority still don’t know vaccines long term efficacy like. wouldn’t shocked eventually becomes rotational vaccine get different manufacturer vaccine booster period cover bases. 

Times 8 billion, 4 times year, rest life. follow money fauci predicts everything.. knew virus way anyone ask bill People die what. TUBMPF made specific argument persuaded group separate meals.
I argued 6 year old catches school Monday sneezes dinner Thursday, goes whole family. 
That seemed trick. Italy cases april. deaths matching cases proportionally. even possible? testing Italy something? I'm Ireland literally exactly said step step. Shutdown essentially zero rate infection, dedicate resources contact tracing, open back slowly everyone wearing masks, yet still largest case numbers we've ever seen 1200 one day yesterday. strategy outlined doesnt keep numbers down. climbing gym opened months ago, following state guideline limited capacity masks worn except actively exercising (aka wall). people apparently went back enough. called members and, based feedback, made masks mandatory times. cautiously went back everyone excited climb again, they’re taking masks distancing seriously. Nobody wants fuck get gym shut down. White everything except controlling spread virus. put effort actually controlling virus, cases would alot lower alot less people would died. Instead hands deck trying kill many Americans possible getting away it. Beyond evil. Leadership. Would care elaborate that. fake news talking about? read article? lol. comparison physician numbers Germany US make sense. Contrary, United States, Germany midlevel providers, nurse practitioners close physician assistants. addition, nurses worse training US nurses requires physicians tasks taken medical professionals US. goes regular hospital beds mostly reflect broad hospitalization culture Germany benefits terms morbidity mortality pandemic.

What eyes, previous reports considered Germany, robust system municipal public health offices. clusterfuck 400 offcies different policies COVID started, great job (not comparison Taiwan South Korea!) contact tracing testing. legal framework necessary (§ 30 Infectious Diseases Act), place wait orders Berlin.

Am German medical graduate contact tester/tracer. Hitler thing. NFL ignoring virus. Buying chinese stock foolish I'm defending position way, idea wearing/recommending masks, general population show less social distancing, seen experts far effective.

I working home since April people office (a actually) need stationed workplace. new restrictions put place right summer maybe people would allowed lunch room, meeting rooms, guests gathered offices could socialize on. even calmer weeks summer, planning ahead putting even stronger restrictions first strike April/may one prepared. anecdote course. Quebec much worse NY, yes, please keep border closed. likely every one people bank accounts Wells Fargo. bank sets flags business loans go personal accounts. bank's security team investigates see legit business. business, majority people might mean termination account reporting government thats extent WF do. WF employees take one step terminating employment. Something obviously trumps preparation... believe reopening would worse economy shutting down? lot people do. points listed problematic summer. Spain, Italy, France, UK Germany numbers 500 daily whole summer long. travellers returned spikes August levelled out. Schools also started August Germany problem, hardly cases. meat factories large outbreaks didn´t spread cities (Tönnies Gütersloh). completely different setting, increase without direct cause, can´t blame specific parties events Germany anymore, diffuse spreading everywhere. didn´t type spreading April September. R0 around 1.1 1.4 Germany. ""Personally responsible""
Have met Americans? We're ""pass buck"" nation refuses act responsibly. We're land cartman's point. Jokes day election matter. likely declared winner least 3-4 weeks mail votes numerous lawsuits injunctions. going make 2000 look orderly comparison. Fall? No.

Next Fall? Possibly. Bush played politics tularemia huge group people thinks vaccine related one conspiracy theory another. People cannot take vaccine receive immunity vaccine possibly die preventable death. Well one reason dear leader dismantled Obama's pandemic response frameworks downplayed virus months making masks political issue. family already cancelled Thanksgiving Christmas gatherings weeks ago. 

My mother-in-law cooks gatherings. gone ahead, think risk food poisoning would higher risk COVID issues. Yeah road part worries me. terrible muscle ache got rash. Went doc. Yep, that’s shingles. WUT?! hell shingles. house social distancing 6 months! Get this. chicken pox 3. Apparently stays spinal column forever. So, are, 40 years later get shingles. Hurts like nothing I’ve ever experienced. It’s aweful. Done meds. Rash going away. Pain still unbearable times. yeah. Viruses weird shit. idea making health care non market good would help.

Fire service geographic service right  Go back r/Collapse please, thanks Bengals gonna win calling upset rn make analogy little accurate, 

Analogy perfect. Historical example Stalin Ukraine.

What Trump exactly same, knew danger sit back played harp... think lot people hoping election political reasons though complete agreement there. countries ever lived, asian population uses masks faithfully seasons respiratory illness, often wondered universal concept, even devastation. spain france much personal contact culture, makes think masks would work better since swedes pretty faithfully ""social distance"" pre-covid well (just personal opinion!). lancet article fucking enormity. remember vaguely disgusted read it.

We barely NPIs **now**, little public appetite them. Public compliance low second wave (first United States) governments much political capital spend. wildly unrealistic expect ""return normal"" simply forced, particularly vaccine, unless understanding Covid-19 changes dramatically (Dengue style ADE perhaps, complete absence immunological adaptation), point individuals driving aversion it. 

The authors paper obviously cannot know one does, they're modeling/talking ass. culture one nut cases, we're probably worst all. something, serious deadly pandemic, never politicized. Then, top it, measures set doctors scientists confront stop virus looked upon infringing someone's freedom, rights endangering breathing CO2. WTF?!!!!! president dismantled safeguards help us detect mobilize pandemic criticized, downplays severity thing. Yeah, know, we've heard before... drives crazy soooo many people suffered long lasting effects Covid 19 thousands continue die get someone White House brain. Spain, Italy, France, UK Germany numbers 500 daily. travellers returned spikes August levelled out. Schools also started August Germany problem, hardly cases. meat factories large outbreaks didn´t spread cities (Tönnies Gütersloh). completely different setting, increase without direct cause, can´t blame specific parties events Germany anymore, diffuse spreading everywhere. didn´t type spreading April September. personally responsible another word selfish? seems like china vaccine working though? thing? misspelled Hack’s say best loved ones. disaster fueled weaponized stupidity. Putin successfully turned mouth breathers deadly weapons. gotta hand him, fucked us good without firing single bullet. ER nUrSe 10 + years write medical appeals home. terrified first started would go back bedside nursing ran frontline nurses due getting sick dying COVID burnout stress...thank protecting family, thank service. think could anymore grateful work home agree...it going get better anytime soon. wear mask stay home unless necessary makes mad see deniers going normal worsening spread. moved Canada 20+ years ago could work nursing first time 20 years wish stayed Canada series never-ending weeks-long shutdowns pregnant women arrested facebook posts questining policy?

This despite sparsely populated Pacific Island hermetically sealed borders? legitimately impression disease stops ripping population ""natural selection"" (whatever fuck means, find single time past thousand years anthropocentric disease stopped ""natural selection) herd immunity?

Like, can't think single disease dangerous common - point human history - isn't? herd immunity? Every disease history curtailed either herd immunity natural selection?

If uneducated even see point talking you. get Reddit pay attention middle school history class that's case. committed relationship year more? may able get exemption travel. Check ""How unite extended family members Canadian citizens permanent residents.""

Sorry hear situation. thing said HCQ Marxh, convolesecnt plasma April, Remdesvir May, vitamin August, interferon September.

I think I'm starting see pattern. you? Depends district guess. live masks went \~50% summer \~90% now. Extremely strict rules put shops indoor spaces definitely helped. V shaped recovery. depression. Prepare accordingly. fall narrative pandemic's doing. not. brink major crisis several years now. Google 2019 repo crisis. probably even hear it. market start crashing December 2018 Fed took rates 2.5% promptly reversed course began dropping rates again?

The pandemic hastened end long term debt cycle in, heading anyway economy waiting kind shock start deleveraging process (recession/depression). 

Just think this: finish year 130% debt GDP. point, permanently low interest rates. ability Fed allow rise else able service debt. consider corporate debt, something like 20% corporations could become insolvent rates zero. long think monetary system handle that? trust me, deficits get bigger stimulus diminished returns. wait wave mortgage defaults roll in. banking crisis waiting standby currency crisis next 3-5 years. Plan accordingly. Listen talking heads peril, saw said early pandemic. research. People like Jeff Snider, Lyn Alden, Brent Johnson brilliant minds get info from. Classic nitpicking, 'how make unequivocally good thing sound questionable'? fuck would lie death loved ones? fucking asshole. dare you? lack empathy truly piece fucking shit. Good plan, friend :)

Thats nothing new, shitty situation, really need try use downtime something positive. Gotta finish dissertation, try bunch new hobbies, on. might actually first time agreed you. forget country (italy?) announced lockdown early pandemic part country gave everyone 24 hours notice something hit highways, taking possessions covid relatives. 

how would respond lockdown different given 24 hours notice versus 24 days notice, example Yes Australia. Vic ftw Thank reconsidering Sorry didn’t mean frame anti-mask sentiment. everyone Sweden repeats said comes straight Tengell’s mouth essentially said. It’s Tengell’s ego getting way what’s right imo It’s people tend stay neighborhoods. OP denialist troll trying stir shit start circlejerk.  known astroturfing technique. 1. Poor state public heathcare. always pool people superspreaders. Adopt socialist universal healthcare. 
2. Many American's faith-based science-based. Bible thumpers. 
3. Many American's remain ignorant. Trump loyalists. Republicans. way mexico paying starve death, murder? Got it...

Starving someone death disease unmanaged. analogy work, specifically purposefully infect someone Covid **WITH INTENT**. Intent literal requirement murder.

Do make analogy little accurate, homeless person dies hunger street... anyone guilty murder get food? Obviously not. 

Doing shitty job controlling virus murder. negligence worst. idk, ya blame him..but lot people time care got coronavirus NGL, job sounds pretty lame. country in? 

I hoping say Australia NZ I’m Colorado, guess that’s asking. got social media month ago Nextdoor heard cities cases climbing fast. live Canon City, home Trump flag wavers without masks. went Shell today one working wore mask, declined card - checked credit card company. I’m scared too. Population density varies too. Germany high population density, parts much higher Netherlands. Spain really big half amount german population (around 40 million). BA Economics Vanderbilt MBA Universtiy Texas

Feel free tell specifically I'm wrong. critical thinking skills hopefully assist that--thus far included content, filler Yes. manner valued US unique. ever heard word... empathy? 


those people get infected, LOT asyntomatic, continue living lives nothing happening, become superspreader, eventually giving someone dies. 

which one cruel? Ok you’re lying, got Brilliant, thanks. fuck even mean? Hi mate! (I’m remembering prior words don’t worry). It’s still low vs many countries mandate masks law. Asia know infection rates much lower. 
Masks don’t seem much effect Spain France cultures quite different. actually framed choice they've many times said possibility masks could recommended certain situations. *worry* expressed people becoming complacent comes hygiene social distancing, important measures individual take preventing spread disease. swedes beginning mask own, albeit large numbers, order mask given, would. agree wear them, best frame anti-mask sentiment one. put Reagan office? Yep, pretty much matter what, always need plumbers electricians. I’m fortunate 20+ years career right steady job, fresh high school college wasn’t option (either pandemic, tuition whatever), trade school would best way go. Snowbirds older retired Canadians go US (Florida Arizona two big states snowbirds) winter. border ostensibly closed, lot going forced spend winter Canada. saw guys news last night said still going fly Florida apparently sun surf important risking getting sick.

If go, they'll quarantine 2 weeks return Canada. Probably good life lesson base anything headline. think knowing certain way way (and matter weeks months rather years) make big difference people's mental health.

As said, I've got tonne work I'm going try throw winter, enjoy come spring/summer. Completely understandable :) Shit work long run, gotta stay safe sane meantime.

Berlin worst hit city like Paris France. I´m shocked see numbers 30k here, still 2 % positive tests. u haven’t even read ;) Trump President. get mathematical models work. I'm talking 100% accuracy. know weather forecast tomorrow going pretty accurate, also know past 10 days weather forecasting much better looking historical averages time place. put high, complete, amount trust tomorrow's forecast. look skeptically forecast week Sunday. particular covid model's predictions wildly fluctuated look skeptically predictions. quite low compared rest Europe right now. 6th fewest cases per capita last time checked.

Right is, also earlier curve european countries unless manage halt spread might reach similar high levels Europe unfortunately. following preparing COVID since January. first person personally knew infected despite following precautions, even know got (probably work). Dumb people drag us let them. Exactly. figure Trump Congress preparedness equation, someone like Andrew Cuomo boasting role leading New York #1 position COVID deaths. Leadership top bottom obsessed media coverage. sizeable group people skipping vaccine US. Sadly result death... would list names thats weird fuck. Especially random ass person doesnt believe virus way. hunt us tell us fake? Want directions gravesite pay visit? didnt get since live another state due military. Tell husband mourning last months fear mongering. Want name too? Want know cried hours couldnt say goodbye? Want tell cousin kids momma died stunt. Get fuck here. study incorporate effects overburdened healthcare systems worldwide due many infections happening once. long-term effects still table. lady walmart trying argue guy day election day everyone told masks longer necessary well

I believe lot restrictions scariness pandemic due politicization media hype. However, think it'll immediate obvious. I’ve read several articles backtracking. don’t trust people lie, say, “I lied reason!”

Weird willingly guys believe everything see/hear/read internet tv don’t question it. quote supports herd immunity, title post misleading. I'm American, *monster* you’re recommending abiding government covid recommendations? do, got it! Thanks! acting like someone severe spinal issues “okay”? defines “okay”? cure shouldn’t harmful wreck spine. say you’re saying lives expendable, also say spinal issues “okay” “expected”. would feel spine issues? Exactly. test subjects spinal issues, many people general public issues it’s released? Maybe better testing certain animals ruin human life. It’s absolutely okay someone injured spine. That’s okay. don’t get what’s hard understand. It’s like “oh whatever hahaha”. No, people dying coronavirus, couple people spine issues addition death toll virus. 7 million infected America PLUS five spine issues. Like, get need vaccine immediately supporting unsafe vaccine? vaccine causes small percentage Americans spine issues? Like understand you’re one spinal issues, least pretend like it’s okay they’re suffering. sounds far fetched. already know lots cases families live together getting it. entire hall 100% infection time seems little excessive. beginning. They've spoken lock downs week. Also scientist reporting based biologist friends think: vaccine fails, probably likely failing due ineffectiveness dangerous.

That say, likely scenario take shot, anything, get coronavirus anyways. scenario vaccine *cause* strange illness rare. Thanks clarification Yeah sadly hopefully, maybe link people around world I’m really hoping actually sewer, specifically sanitary sewer, amount homeless people defecating streets days... fear may actually storm drains... Nope, actually pointed european countries higher counts per capita lately. expect America catch well.

No one special here. foolish Europe act like beat this, foolish US assume higher counts coming soon too. Covid likes share love, equal opportunity virus.  long it’s Leafs Best wishes speedy recovery.

Fingers crossed placebo group. people US absolutely receive full vaccination schedule.

Exactly. schools open fully vaccine? kids fully vaccinated. couple years ago, provided updated vaccination schedule even go school provided. Yet open schools like big deal virus pandemic vaccine. Tell makes goddamn sense whatsoever?  Maybe death worse thing happen. range health issues get COVID fairly large, including potential fertility problems, even dying much still pretty bad.  Europe higher per capita numbers America, it’s easier shit America. lack common sense American people (him specifically) landed ICU first place. Thunder Bay actually remote That's used call deathbed conversion. deliberately misrepresenting actions. 4 days end 11 day period last interaction them. cdc recommendation 10-14 days. Shes doping things correctly. State University’s research spray shows great promise, 99.97% virus destroyed mixed **spray test tubes** Awesome, good luck. sort struggles recently. people working hospitals, old news. go local ER ask nurses repeat visitors. places them. getting reported journals yet come shortly. Well going open branch company Ottawa. Guess Iceland instead. Quebecoise Seriously, thank increased number ICU beds there’s shortage medical workers basically 20% ICU beds can’t filled staff time train people.

They’ll probably force unprepared, untrained med students work ICUs like first wave.. anyone reading this, imagine participating community basis believing people ""pro"" ""anti"" virus.

The downplayers' core tenet like situation, winning argument socially, deal problem. is, care virus all. them, entirely social psychological pandemic. Good, right thing patent it, inflate cost 300%. make much, want keep supply drive price ever higher. way. Here's projection. Millions give damn, call flu, continue make stupid decisions act something teach.

I can't take seriously. fair, give US shit want (I too), Europe started great, we've essentially caught daily cases. initial lockdown (3 months country) people seemed considered pandemic done with, spiraling control ever since. Hi Torrent!  answer may get banned Donald Trump how. suppose might bit ethical younger blokes. wouldent mind getting corona feeling bit shit week helped people get cracking vaccine. wasn’t pandemic Significantly harder justify actually. part even though covid point pandemic   True man, true that. Stay safe man 14 year old child officially done Trump..

Good job! $$$$$$ Also oddly enough nate silver talked today Twitter 60% less year? guys want shift goalposts back bit sake argument? Weird. Especially people see sub starting agree vaccinating old people lot flexibility normal lives. Wisconsin G P blood hands. Imagine working company officials try openly sabatoge permission board. didn't.

You're bunch desperate drama queens agenda. much it? 

Also put note somewhere main post translating please?

Money, money, money, money, money  


this think u/tB0x saying vaccine proves effective reducing disease severity risk populations (elderly/people multiple comorbidities), ifr drops low becomes non-issue really quickly. guarantee vaccine provide sterilizing immunity, quite unclear point extent vaccination might contribute herd immunity.

While understand long term effects covid, becomes much difficult justify social distancing people dying large numbers anymore. get go St. Luke's hospital Monday surgery. Went one clinics morning covid test. Yeah I’m sure working small office space wearing mask, people preexisting conditions pandemic something last year. 

Brain worms confirmed. were...until current administration choose follow science. disregard science based evidence focus economy, lead dark path.... Call couple hard pipe hitting never chance we’d handle well. reason, anti-intellectualism vogue U.S. used point pride child accepted Ivy League university - it’s insult.

Take Reagan HIV/AIDS. took action whatsoever ilk actually thought viruses moral code. long virus “just” killing gay men, cared? stupid understand contagious disease is, know, contagious. Dude we’re asking please please please lurk Put idiot charge happens 3 day moving average deaths/day France jumped 100. single digits summer 

at height first wave nearly 1,000 deaths/day Spring wave never bloody ended. Idk getting traction, comments people bitching trump/comparing USA/bringing USA politics it/being smug Why? btw last post ""Ukraine reports record 2134 new cases 40 new deaths"" whats difference source? Oh oh know know pick pick “So ask favor: ~~suburban women~~ seniors, please like me?” Best? watching many American made movies. over, dude. post hidden, person saw nonsense me, even read it. click reply, I'm blocking permanently. I've lost everything protecting family shit. son almost died RSV last winter. one cares you. care them? Considering states lean, I'm going assume majority infected majority said state.

Could mean states may flip year.  shelves empty!!! /s Yes Im sure living life lived year ago selfish reckless it? 
it didn't. ...so shut fuck lies propaganda. 

also, get life, people Anyone thinks country 10th amendment best prepared viral outbreak stupid considering listening  take guess Dutchie here, want give context case numbers here. got somewhat decent testing capacity RECENTLY. kind testing capacity back March, today's number cases would lower end imagine. I'm going number daily reported infections vs. people ICU's.

Not downplaying anything here. stating new record Netherlands, hardly highest number daily new infections probably since March. know bulk spread within people younger age categories whose age generally keeps hospitals, widely reported number infections steadily rising among elderly well. Things definitely way worse back March. hope current measures place enough curb spread. Imagine everyone thought “what chances?” stopped something simple wearing mask. It’s living fear, it’s common sense respect others around you. Probably, idea, owned TV decade.

I dont get people dont go directly CDC's website stats. dont need Lemon Tucker Carlson's spin thing, brain own.

Check survey posted get idea misinformed average American is. another survey average American polled thought 9% COUNTRY (30M people) died corona! think decision close 11pm there's something special time. reasoning probably reduce amount time available socializing. choice ban 11pm-6am instead time frame arbitrary choice? Maybe, think makes choosing stupid, means reason choose time period instead.

As shutting entirely better, sure, think generally helpful frame problems nothing solutions. Considering court's response order, sounds like half measure proposed compromise provide degree protection trying (and apparently failing) avoid scenario. Well one data point surely invalidates decades epidemiology infectious disease research. I'll let everyone know. one happens to. bot good. Jeez. Nonpartisan sections likely skipped. believe statistic MI 16% ballots skip section. think part people vote straight ticket bother looking rest it. judge section nonpartisan. crazy week really windy. Denver really felt like apocalyptic wasteland. fires year terrible. can't take seriously. outbreak probably happened even closer 2 months apart Chinese government initially covering least bullying citizens, scientists doctors never even utter things explained bug going around social media. timing defunding irksome. that's inoising. think I'm going limb assume that's almost everyone.

Yep, called, April 8th, federal support allowing folks sort out. 

The fact remains folks like me, would relatively safe carefully interact folks like me. 

Which intend doing, loneliness staggering. denature can't drink it. typically folks love snarkily point (along 40mil Americans) live ""Commiefornia"". think important recognize amount excess infections deaths seeing happening corner US. policy choice highest levels.  take precautions can.

Wear mask. Social distance. Wear comfortable gloves slapping hos get close. One word~ ""Trump"". Donald systematically dismantled ability fight pandemic top bottom like planned. 

Which leads another word~ ""Putin"". speaks english Donald one else listening know...  Go thrive funky little scientist  Anyone want share experiences vaccine trials? took first shot morning part Pfizer trial. consent form, couple blood draws, vaccine placebo &amp; door 150.00 COVID-19 home test kit. really noticed anything except tiny amount injection site soreness. Based highly dramatic side effect profiles I've reading online, I'm pretty much convinced got placebo. No. Funding. Disqualified :p  One rational comments sea “but Trump”. spot on. Also weight given personal accountability citizens fact it’s virus. It’s insane read comment comment seem indicate stopped one man. Newest charts show case rates Europe, laughed us summer, overtaking US. anything playing cannot really contained. honestly quit focusing cases look death rates treatments. interesting cases increase deaths remaining flat. way people infected increase deaths tells us virus far less deadly originally thought treatments becoming effective mitigating death toll vs amount cases. interested looking studies show precautions taken vs death rates area. read Reddit get impression everyone thinks America nothing, many states locked March/April flatten curve, mine still mask mandate stores restaurants drastically reduced capacity. brutal post. US even highest infections per capita. numerous countries much higher infections per capita, believe Russia China even reported real numbers, Indias numbers anywhere close be, part media hoax trying make US look like apocolypse. elected bunch politicians looking make profits death rather prevent it, and/or using 2,000 book dictate 2020 health policies. And/or 40 million+ Americans sufficiently brainwashed believing science intelligence offensive Yep, that's contact tracing. *coronavirus restrictions plunge millions Americans poverty herd immunity strategy restrictions. Let's keep conspiracy theories away discussion. con. stronger country wanted war, got war. People believe righteous really care invaded nations. suffering amnesia. care ones suffering. ones care protest get ignored get smeared unpatriotic terrorist sympathizers.


Same Chinese nationals brush Uyghur detention. suffer it. benefit directly it. Add strong arm government top that, one going care. ones might care would think better acting care get smeared unpatriotic terrorist sympathizers.

Scary strongest nations earth right now. Natural strongest nations earth right now. looking forward future either them, climate change resource scarcity breathing necks. lie Republican party convinced many people problems come external factors elected leaders one impressive accomplishments date. Oh it’s called “not living fear”? totally sure it’s called “being reckless selfish” ?Maybe doesn’t it? happens behavior continues ends getting spreading it? What’s called then? 

What gets spreads guy asthma? elderly lady upstairs? What’s called then? living fear? 

See pattern reckless behavior increases likelihood catching spreading it. person routinely coughs sneezes without mask on. God forbid actually gets thing then.

Do get now? brain work? state plans administering vaccine. It’ll similar state covid testing setups mixed current state flu vaccine distribution. argument actual data then. Interesting, that's trend people now. Probably says psychology anything covid. Herd immunity always goal. 

Show official document stating herd immunity / goal. give BS *""they talked email it""*. legitimate source assertion, one lying here. Bars opened almost everywhere Europe. get drunk drink more. idea nothing change, within world collapsing weight contradictions, nothing fixed, exactly can't provide solutions want think. 

A better world possible, organize fight [Belgium entered chat] old people went church 30 years ago still hate Fauci say HIV kind conspiracy Fauci working God's plan. I. people want wear mask go around town fuck em. Germany. comparatively last year kicked September. know we’re clear imagining last year’s early start protracted fire season coupled Covid. model exactly that. 

* projection ""Mandates Easing"" scenario mask/distancing/closure mandates reduced. 
* projection ""Universal Masks"" scenario everyone wears masks. 
* general ""Current Projection"" lies between.

As underestimate initial days pandemic: assumed Americans would best counter pandemic. unreasonable assumption. One word. Trump trump... that's how. got president I'm pretty sure alzheimer's dementia despite w/e reported tests claim. 

bleach cures it.
85% people wearing masks catch covid. 
expert windmills. 
variety otherwise comedic failures would actually amusing leader country makes fact useful, article also says death rates still way lower. means either health care systems significantly worse testing less. Probably latter.   yup, exactly happen. well put Bad leadership. don’t report it, don’t cases. /s US Covid death rate statistics full reflection reality simply lot people Covid die Covid tested documented died Covid

Any source claim? Cause [CDC health providers followed clearly states Covid immediate cause death, neither underlying, neither cause death neither diagnostic required - mere suspicion Covid based symptoms fever, cough, fatigue, headache, nausea (pretty much universal symptoms dying) result death reported ""Covid death"". that's reported, even pushback plenty agencies change way loose reporting - [here's quick google no, numbers deflated.

But let's assume big conspiracy U.S. lying numbers - **nothing assumptions** draw conclusions impact U.S. healthcare Covid outcomes understand make claims confidence. KNOW ANYTHING

Well, know country access BETTER healthcare Sweeden **2 TIMES** patient fatality rate country LESS access WORSE healthcare add up, either U.S. healthcare system twice good Sweden's y'all making dumbest point. remind still royal families remove US health insurance industry, employing 1.5 million people, without massive recession depression.  Corrupt people used steal billions. thing happened throughout wars start. People feel whatever feel. try expose family potentially deadly virus. matter afraid not. virus certainly care. Chinese restaurant dumpster sex still good, right? Fuck WI GOP Supreme Court. Actively working increasing cases state. fucking joke, yet are.  I’m ok letting people find wrong hard way. Trump administration 2608 new cases Portugal equals around 78000 US, deaths would around 600 “Compared “no rPPE” controls, N95 respirators conferred protection confirmed SARS-CoV infection 2 3 case-control studies [32, 33]; protective effect SARS reported disposable [29, 34], cotton [35], paper [32] masks” Pick can. release Cyberpunk 2077? happened Democrats came first publicly concern regarding coronavirus. 

Trump never let Democrats right.

So literally insane still say that, statistical fact COVID least 10 times deadlier average (depending age though) + probably dangerous terms long term damage well. still answer flu kills ~60k people restrictions, wfh, business closures, 100k+ people events.

The really strict restrictions really seem saving lives, least US. Florida California similar deaths per capita despite Florida at-risk population far less restricted (compare two Disneys). Covid killed ~200k+ less year (we still another ~4 months go lap thing) that's extraordinary shutdown measures.

Single year-long slices arbitrary. flu happens *every* single year, one.  Personal responsibility

You accidentally misspelled ""I whatever f*ck want mentality"" Partisan politics led giant drug-addled narcissist. know. I'm tired deal people. I'm mental fatigue. election coming really knowing going go wanting make future plans case suddenly become refugee...I just...wake over? idiots always say ""dO rEsEaRcH"" instead providing credible sources? make convincing people easier? Oh right sources apart Facebook conspiracy videos YouTube. Stupidity EVERY level. local up. Downplayed beginning almost EVERYWHERE, regardless party. Agree everything said here. difficult situation, definitely difficult one track properly - reinfections must nightmare. ""Last flu season, North Carolina reported 186 flu deaths""

And year North Carolina 3,800 covid19 deaths.

How world people think ""just flu bro"" Yup, family common sense. gathering year. East Asians New Zealanders sheep robots. /s Oh I’m even referring individual wealth. I’m saying US government wealthiest government world. person can't change mind given evidence contrary belief far worse. time studieas proving mask effectiveness either, since many studies. also chance able learn infection rate spread countries. one people can't examine evidence unbiased situation...because sounds like it. emotions involved, point ignorance can't excuse, willful hatred pride. mean hoping itd election financial security mostly lockdown might quite literally kill me. think hoping boat except select idiots administration.

Biden2020 Yeah agreed, people continue ignore social distancing. That's them. Trump. think good company lol 

But I'm sure ""lockdown skeptics"" going conveniently use comment ""evidence"" people want ongoing lockdowns, justifying continuing hysteria fight them

Even though lockdowns US

And restrictions relaxed marketing

2020 style Aside obvious failure federal government, lot factors involved. particular US ""healthcare"" system. countries single payer system, people afraid go doctor fear bankruptcy. US, people typically seek medical treatment they're dire circumstances.  


With covid, dire circumstances means they'd already public disease quite long time. people likely spread quickly, seeking medical attention confined beds. 218,000 dead Americans important “if it’s shown effective?” can't person go get food own?

I dunno, ask Irish immigrant came starving country food. know Germany, masks mandatory Belgian classrooms. Maybe doctors name John Lord. seems like nice guy good doctor. Believe science.
Don't believe science.
Science give fuck. true people need also take responsibility stupidity Lol okay. sources? Facebook? millions unemployed

political $6T excess defiicit

because Fed promised unlimited liquidity prop stock children educations severely compromised

I mean, people could kept mind ""schools start fall"" fall, actually stuff fend virus children's education pscyhological effects hundreds millions.

The US haunts even live there, tremendous suffering, disorganisation, lack human contagious

You've misunderstood. Covid mainly spreads superspreading events. Stopping least managing goes long way stopping contagion. US has/had wherewithal control epidemic, chose to. agree however one actively burning everything isnt progressive wanted open change. Biden Obama years call Biden 2020 left, imagine decade democratic control last 20 years? iraq war, battling climate change maybe better ACA public option. failure America always conservative party whats worse 100 million constantly vote creating better life.  it’s pandemic like masks? Good morning! So, desktop answer questions bit depth (my virus study corona, can't rattle facts it, gotta check lol).

So sars-CoV2 member betacoronavirus genus. subgroup members really include sars-CoV bat coronaviruses we'll compare spikes genus level.

I choose OC43 compare to, could also compare HKU1. OC43 HKU1 bind molecule known 9-O-acetylated sialic acid. molecule found cell surface proteins, acts binding site two viruses.


If compare OC43 HKU1 spike proteins, find areas conserved, fact expected share affinity towards 9-O-acetylated sialic acid. line protein sequence, see large frequent stretches aminoacids order (the way read chart put one protein sequence top others, letter stands amino acid, * low, notice exact letter sequences. look long stretches stars. (this basic analysis, similar amino acid substitution happens properties similar enough change shape much such, color coding, worry that, look stars)).

I've underlined long stretches conserved amino acid sequences red here: compare OC43 SARS-CoV-2: still conserved regions, much. terribly likely get cross reactivity antibodies, thus immunity betacoronavirus genus whole. politicized him. Stop pretending like otherwise. Ridiculous. guys MICROBIOLOGIST y’all didn’t know. No, 330m reasons colors. Stop politicizing this, it’s killing people. K. idiot dismantled pandemic preparedness 🤦🏻‍♂️Kinda important that, apparently. else fucked us *this* bad Thanks China! Putin vaccine, possible? imagine ambulance, dying, hospital like ""sorry, can't take you, we're full."" Un-goddam-believable. 

Anti-mask protests viral pandemic. America's greatest hour. Why? Rich homeowners SoCal hiring illegals nannies. people blindly following political party, alright lol can’t separate work home, might need look ability set boundaries. way see it, never agreed work way scheduled ending time every day, employer isn’t position demand me. Yep, pretty sure 400k reporting accounted for. I've noticed previous day numbers worldometers go days late reports come in. assertion ""the U.S. world's best prepared nation confront pandemic"" false premise. US advanced healthcare, access said healthcare limited often cost prohibitive. lack commitment ""greater good"" single identity nation opposed current tribal mentality turned easily implemented scientifically proven mitigation techniques political posturing citizenry. post history pretty amazing reply can't say anything bad BLM get suspended I'm speaking first hand experience. elected fascist 2016. Next question. yeah  No, I’m advocating sacrificing people. are. insisting become Korea tomorrow force us fantasy world elimination around corner. We’ve constant untraced community spread 7 months. Nothing changes tomorrow, Nov 4th Jan 20th. Make plan reasonable feasible, plan based wishes fantasy. One big orange reason particular. Enough pretending US better? smh. Weak. weak. Trump. ... yes sir! wealth world mean jack concentrated hands rich people, rest population lives paycheck paycheck, government take effective measures beyond barest amount welfare. I'm saying rich people (inherently) bad, making money bad, current configuration wealth flows america way favors vast majority citizens. 

Same resources like medical care well. current, pay-to-play system favors afford it. dont think winter hit US yet? Much colder EU right BNO reporting media, general, reporting like America problems COVID. large, US needed either. I've got ICU experience too; little fear things get extra bad winter, I'll asked go help there. know it'll happen, I'm trying mentally prepare possibility. hard run propaganda regime scientists major trusted organization like CDC spouting facts truth. way handle destroy credibility CDC install cronies run organization. Can’t wear nice cloth masks work, wear **issued** paper ones.

I bolded you, since two sentences hard. BOTs working hard make America look bad anymore since polls favoring somebody. Dude, let go. fuck wrong you? Voting's kind shit answer options ""HA HA HA FUCK I'LL TAKE MYSELF!"" ""Weelllll, okay, we'll split 60/40 favor, we'll make 10% contribution charity too. Oh, yeah, 10% come portion.""

Both major parties US primarily motivated profit. One less rabid it. Fuck, socialized medical care _still_ table meaningful way, instance, goddamned pandemic! Russian trolls getting lazy now. must get paid post. Turd

Sure cough loss taste, gonna get tested. classic symptoms, enough resources test literally every patient. fact tally deaths diverges much excess death numbers solid proof continue miss 20-30% cases there.

My family is. We're still going see extent, big family dinner gathering. 


I'm cooking home two grandparents. 

My grandparents 88, obviously need extra careful. live closest though, see regularly age need someone help certain daily tasks. I'm always mask though, keep distance, etc. 

They understand can't big Thanksgiving Christmas dinner year entire family. thought process basically, ""Look, can't cook Turkey dinner age, see regularly anyways things, we're already 88, we'd like holiday's least one person.""


And can't argue all, I'll glad them. 


The plan dinner mom, dad, brother SIL come coffee dessert. living room, dining room, kitchen open concept.

Mom sit living room tv trays, grandparents dining room table, brother SIL folding chairs tv trays middle kitchen. Everyone's 10 ft away, still able see talk. coffee, pie, call night. 


Small safe gathering. 

I know people sub *more* cautious it, consider aptly safe compromise though.   


I'm actually excited. I've wanted host Thanksgiving Christmas years. first half life grandparents it, mom grandparents got old. Covid think turn takeover would another 20 years, disappointing someone loves cooking. 

So, gotta look bright side. built handy covid tracking tool state (ohio). feedback would greatly appreciated!
http://covid.maxheckel.me Lots reasons. can’t. It’s 7 months. Enough pretending can, let’s make plans accomplish. agree incredibly high status CDC. work micro lab, pretty much ""go to"" site.

I disagree making mistakes. Advice given best available information time, subsequently changed evidence supports mistake - science works.

The political interference WH new. article December 2017 shows administration already forbidden phrases like ""Evidence based"". Repost excluded micronations. think would unfolded roughly matter leadership. culture people can’t handle slightest inconvenience.

I used believe democrat response would work based well democrat governor handled things state. Things going really well while. let schools universities bars reopen everything skyrocketed. always going shit show matter election, people country don’t care others’ safety. Ah, FaceBook Karens went school ""being mom"" ""knowing what's best I've done research I'm sheep."" creatures wreaking havoc country right now. rules enforced Australia know children preexhisting conditions, headache certain childhood illnesses. probably least dozen. think mental health issues like intellectual disability counts, see one yourself. Especially chronic illness! frequently believed doctors told really bad. started showing symptoms endometriosis 16, diagnosed 25. researched condition found gynecologist specializes endo could get help! surgery doctor said honestly idea could even walk bad endo was, permanent scarring result. I'd diagnosed earlier, might permanent side effects.  none could ever aspired astronomical levels idiocy Trump effortlessly attained. Repost Odin Zeus gilead making mad money right now. plan release phase 3 efficacy data? advocating giving potentially sacrificing millions half-assed self-sabotaged efforts wildly effective. exactly opening floodgates younger people reduce exposure everyone else? Let's maybe try sensible change leadership first Woah. thought one. needs nationally mandated people children sick, need **stay home** **be paid**. Okay, don’t want lockdowns shit? Fine. pay people stay home sick waiting test results.

If flu actively spreading covid, that’s nightmare scenario. ain’t like body takes one fighter time, you’re infected both, you’re bad bad time. comorbidities (which US does!) you’re it. effed around we’re find happens. still think US mostly freedom something Germany freedom something lot stronger, especially something else freedom government. think 14 continues drop I'll never get Coronavirus disinfect insides 80 proof every night! Link preprint : can't person go get food own? there's action leads murder.  ok Jenny happened authority? happened election year. Yeah it’s completely sensationalized take get clicks. says widely available. Dude reddit, people jobs lol. So? Also, also includes bronchitis pneumonia. I""m saying appear enough testing resources that
lots people negative getting tested, patient presents
complaining Covid-19, ability test possible.

The bigger problem early epidemic, people getting tested,
then got tested later virus cleared antibodies went down. Considering much advanced terms science, medicine, culture, technology last 100 years done whole lot better. i'm lazy look countries, there's us :

Current cigarette smoking highest among people aged 25–44 years 45–64 years. Current cigarette smoking lowest among people aged 18-24 years.

Nearly 8 every 100 adults aged 18–24 years (7.8%)
Nearly 17 every 100 adults aged 25–44 years (16.5%)
About 16 every 100 adults aged 45–64 years (16.3%)
About 8 every 100 adults aged 65 years older another source gives 10 year difference age smokers versus non smokers, although studies shown higher amounts. seriously shift death rates looking Asheville, NC? bit surprised find country's 95% mask rate. government gave disposable masks per household serious lockdown. free reusable cloth masks, used types masks now. 

Asking citizens wear government statements, news health ambassadors patrolling highly populated town areas making sure people gathered spot wearing masks. Oh $300 fine subsequent offense, can't forget that. little bit coercing thrown in. Right... think anti science types.  decided waging war easier saving American lives.  EU average US compared Sweden. getting cold going get worse northern hemisphere soon probably, assume (from experience Slovenia) governments absolutely jack shit prepare second wave summer. Swept rug corporate media. Can't know what's happening keep everyone distracted consuming. It’s dubious claim US best equipped deal it, point spiraled never happened. lack national plan going fall travesty. Wtf mean? America run fantasy based thinking? personally would LIKE pandemic over, realistically never leave due transmissibility lack durable immunity. Shit ass leadership cares $$$ people, that's how. many cases due social distancing policies (cancelling mass gatherings big one), failing really badly protecting elderly spring, they're quite well. # spiral 'almost inconceivable' failure?

Because POTUS wanted get reelected Economy want people get tested. Remember ""slow testing please"".  phizer lead now? think know answer murder is, definition, unlawful. wish murder. playbooks basically based CDC research. care China taking care citizens. karma Remember subreddit minimum account age? symptom disease. Almost half picked him. told nurses back July, may changed, experience - depends person symptoms don't. believe sniffly type symptoms usually earlier positive results. 

Some people may test positive day 3 others test negative day 3 test positive day 7. 

If simply asking time exposure time testing positive, still think 2-14 days, depend person; definitive answer. 

But keep mind, test false negatives. serious case requires hospitalization, may show via lung scans example. would different time frame, depend person case. 

So basically: unfortunately, think hard rule test may indicate infected. I'm glad enforced somewhere. Here, not. I'm Southern half state, stubbornness ignorance soul-crushing. never know mask mandate around here. shows numbers. [Drunk driving fatalities nearly 50% since 1991 thanks efforts combat it, including federal programs raise awareness dangers. imagine leader federal government telling people covid dangerous? Yes it´s exponential growth now. Haha yeah small world gonna talk news disinfo, registered democrats overestimating risk covid 10-100x? Pretty anti-scientific ask Trump. It’ll either socially science-based. coworker hasn’t put mask today she’s two hours. Crazy shit say American, good...

I'd never wish Northern Neighbors get sick stupidity carelessness.

Of course wish different times, think warranted decision.

Stay safe everyone. guess immediate shutdown could prevent parties right end date, scheduled lockdown would probably better compliance way people would time stock groceries, change plans, etc.

This also something many experts recommended. Dr. Rajiv Chowdhury [proposes ""50-30"" original FEMA plan suggested scheduling returns ""intensive mitigation"" dates planned advance, school breaks, etc. wont over. endemic disease. Hope plan half class participated something half didn’t, logic, everyone face consequences association?

Plus, 43% isn’t even majority, 57% are, that’s wrong. Also didnt help fauci others anti mask may. Imagine wearing masks march started scientists you, 2 months later confirm right along. course gonna confidence think already demonstrated smarter 'scientists' general curfew big cities start tonight, hope help. Finally ""positivity""/decency! unless someone else already it. think electing reality TV huckster fraud lead us may part problem. course. inadvisable rely hope make plans based hope.

Not instinctual authoritarian power grab, transparent stating facts ground (e.g. cases highly specific sensitive circumstances - LTC facilities, prisons, etc.).

In words, leader. everyone knows lockdowns occur, would massive parties everywhere right deadline right lockdown lifted. curve would “flattened” extent, cases would spike lockdowns lifted. 

A effective solution CA doing. Close indoor dining, period. Require masks worn public times, calculate indoor occupancy ratings school openings based percentage new cases. four tier system tied whole concept it’s actually working.

&amp;#x200B;

A 53-year-old woman tested positive new coronavirus May August. between, virus-free.

&amp;#x200B;

Researchers Sahlgrenska University Hospital say thus confirm first case relapse covid-19 Sweden.

&amp;#x200B;

The 53-year-old woman's doctor became suspicious patient's medical history advised research group Gothenburg case. Since September, Sahlgrenska University Hospital University Gothenburg capacity examine genome virus strains entirety. technology makes ST doctor doctoral student Johan Ringlander sure case.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**- ten positions, virus strain differed May strain sampled August.** means say two different infections one dormant, says Johan Ringlander

&amp;#x200B;

According research group, finding surprising. similar cases reported internationally.

&amp;#x200B;

\- probably matter time would get secured case well. know coronaviruses risk recurrence.

&amp;#x200B;

**Does show anything immunity? may able count it?**

&amp;#x200B;

\- think so. anything, shows woman actually granted partial immunity. mild illness second time indicates received protection first infection.

&amp;#x200B;

The result could thus provide support assumption people recovered covid-19 probably entails immunity fully partially protects re-illness, assumption behind Public Health Agency's advice guidelines.

&amp;#x200B;

**Three cases analyzed Sahlgrenska's study. None new infections.**

&amp;#x200B;

\- cases, virus strain reappeared. patients elderly ill weakened immune system before. may meant virus could remain latent them, says Johan Ringlander.

&amp;#x200B;

When 53-year-old woman tested antibodies mid-September, low levels it. researchers believe may belong category develops weak defenses disease therefore extra sensitive re-disease.

&amp;#x200B;

\- want emphasize think worried news. isolated case case indicates get mild illness re-onset covid-19, says Johan Ringlander. sure Sweden seems framed choice social distancing masks. It’s doesn’t choice. It’s clearly better use both. February vibes BNO lately. long? 220000 dead 8 million infections nearly 3% fatality rate that's confirmed medical professionals agree probably far higher closer 320000 dead more.

""I take responsibility"" ""Its hoax"" neighbors Norway Finland 1/10 many per-capita deaths Sweden. Denmark 1/5, Iceland 1/20. I'm entirely sure Nordic countries get hit badly spring others. Sweden got hit MUCH, MUCH harder neighbors. them, Sweden included, seeing case counts rise. Daylength doesn´t matter, get cold air Antlantic ocean. Greece still warm higher latitude New York. way Europe 40 degree latitude, comparable Canada. can't suck fuck like S. Korea Japan? think depends. BC government issued statement saying want see employees back office, least part time. Personally, I'm half half. typically 3 days week office, 2 home, although spent last 3 weeks self-isolating home parent surgery, wanted able help needed. employer issue that.

My partner, hand, started new job July. He's never worked office, see going long time. time saw coworkers live stopped office pick computer monitor, drive-in event company hosted. stayed car, least kinda got see faces. Well, shit hit close home. daughter 17. first test positive house. one still displaying symptoms, 5 weeks later. got doctor's appointment next Tuesday. That's frustrating thing virus: know yet full effects. I'm happy many test positive, battle through, fine (like boss, proclaiming ""it big deal."") worry kids got worst part this. *not* back normal yet, know be. 

She also extreme abdominal pain, much googling ""appendicitis."" gotten confused month times (granted, year cluster, legit confused October comes November, honor roll student). 

And mind you, kid *wanted* get back work. wants get back gymnastics. detests feeling limited, poo-poohing COVID get-go (as young tend think they're immortal). 

It sucks. Jesus christ go downhill comment Joe Grogan, Gilead lobbyist, member Trump's coronavirus task force.

He announced leaving administration day Fauci described remdesivir ""standard care"" Trump sat several feet away.

And Fauci made announcement prior release Lancet study find much benefit remdesivir.

I feel Fauci. alternated standing Trump making attempts appease him. can't appease bullies. insist comprehensive peer-reviewed study supporting lockdowns mask mandates? Neither supported evidence.

Or insistence perfect evidence limited good news? names ? doesn’t make sense 4 people 10k actually died Covid - must something telling us- something tells spreading fear brainwashed sheep “The Party™ would like rephrase report.” Maybe hammering message beginning: ""This us long while, please show perseverance. on/off situation"". would believe authorities, social distancing face masks. I'm delusional however, think spared things start take around us. dont agree check numbers Netherlands. Lots testing doesnt mean numbers higher. 

Just look IC numbers, says way testresults cause thats constant factor, test results not. Yeah, mean, better prepared say island nation like New Zealand high rural populations, high standard education living?

It's silly think somehow US ""best prepared"". American ego-centrism. months still fantasy land. 

In six months, someone say ""a months, it!"" Yeah I'm trying optimistic. last 7-8 months need good news :0)  I’m proud American, assertion independent personally responsible unique American traits laughable. Optimistic, yes. Innovative, sure. Open new ideas, absolutely. personal responsibility strong suit Americans. spain starts increasing again, dropped 10k week ago. watch last 16 seconds clip pretty much summarizes US response covid agree, deaths rise bit longer. probably get ~50 deaths/day couple weeks come back down. like similar midwest states. “The study, peer-reviewed, found four treatments tested — remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir interferon — “ little effect 28-day mortality in-hospital course COVID-19 among hospitalized patients.”

Remdesivir drug four largely ruled ineffective fighting COVID-19.” poor leadership lack case Far fewer globally would died lockdowns. saving elderly wealthy first-worlders expense many young people developing countries. name altruism. Germany plans close bars restaurants 11 pm 6 am, risk areas. may enough stop spread. also draw bullseye around theory like European example claim right, make right. criticizing dynamic sudden situation disgusting. clear case convenience critic hindsight.

There's fucking plan deal situation like this. Multiple experts wrong; changed mind. Health organizations same. right response factors considered. we're seeing, lock downs damaging effect multiple fronts.

When populace least cooperative world, expect? 2020 people still can't navigate parking lot cooperatively. 

And let's point medical industry fucking dinosaur. Medicine, 2020, joke. old insanely expensive. people bitching \*Un\* affordable Care Act bitching widespread price gouging treatments. Million dollar medical treament?! half million dollar prescriptions per year? Poland generally inability central government issue laws mandates limit spread. mask mandate recently, denying pandemic elections over, lowered funding medical facilities recent years contributed towards making Poland one countries experiencing huge boom cases right now. wish government/insurance type places talked this. recall long effective, generally whole season. hope enough people get one different times told, provides protection whole season. 

i forget health care workers seniors get first everyone else wait bit vice versa, last xx years saying ""if 18-35 get flu shot (month) best protect grandparents"" we'd different discussion regards masks, distancing, etc. Oh nice concentration camp? Well makes okay then! /s  one done comprehensive peer reviewed study COVID-19 transmissions airplanes, plenty evidence suggest transmission occur. deny irrational.

' remarkably high prevalence SARS-CoV-2 infection cohort, despite lack symptoms: 3.6% (95% CI: 2.0–6.1%) passengers coming UK, 6.3% (95% CI: 4.1–9.2%) Spain 6.3% (95% CI: 0.8–20.8%) Turkey. ' True extended family huge parties, nothing's happened yet though. 🤔 least expert bag gave go back home office (if possible). really hope gov. put boundaries again. Nazi human experimentation series medical experiments large numbers prisoners, including children, Nazi Germany concentration camps early mid 1940s, World War II Holocaust. Chief target populations included Romani, Sinti, ethnic Poles, Soviet POWs, disabled Germans, Jews across know date study, here's one Stanford dated Oct says 0.23%
The number cited btw, IFR. final death rate. final death rate would IFR * infection rate, almost certainly exceed 100% No, probably busy carving stuffs rocks something rest world something. Land free it, obviously. best everything allegedly. Trump Yeah heard making BANK marking people Covid. 

/S

(People know hospitals easy con believing lies Covid profitable hospitals.) Quarantine question

My girlfriend (whom live with) part group Sunday contained someone travels work colleague tested positive Monday. Neither us exhibit symptoms. need quarantine we're going thing right way? know localities slack quarantine rules, going immunology infectious disease protocols, begin quarantine? ripping Europe politicians care damage cause economy. think goes away even vaccine. It'll either like flu, thing kills people every year vaccinate suppress people gain measure immunity even full immunity wanes (part novel flu strains deadly, people exposed them) may mutate somewhat less deadly well. combination partial immunity past mutations lead ending basically another ""common cold"" virus. fucking GRADUATE DEGREE MICROBIOLOGY. downvotes pure demonstration people ignoring expert advice. Pathetic. true epidemic United States. 

I think apply Microbiologist flair Subreddit. ruin it, set fire scattered ashes people US really trust government, would wearing masks. Seems futile.  people go couple blocks stuff open?  guess get thinking..  Close salon leave salon nearby open? Even corona ripped uncontrolled NYC spring South summer, never point hospitals forced triage. used excess capacity, yes, IFR data takes account use.

During rips, large % population got infected, subsequent wave involve large set nullifed points transmission. NFL and/or NCAA football take extended break lead country-wide psuedo shut again? 

some lady walmart trying argue guy day election day everyone told masks longer necessary well, what's weirdest prediction seen lately? outcome herd immunity US have? 7 straight months community transmission, cannot/will stop it. pretending viable elimination strategy? Since not/ herd immunity inevitable, skew population contracts virus toward younger crowd. Right young sheltered least risk 1,000x. 

We won’t Korea tomorrow, aren’t capable. therefore pragmatic skew infections toward minimal risk, rather skew toward most. Yeah got mine couple months ago. hope remains effective throughout season Wow sound like fun guy!! yea, crazy situation think crazy watch unfold. think political agenda guy pursuing, im sure sort financial backing take ridiculous amounts fines, im sure gym membership income hes making cant pay off. also thing starting charge interest top. mathematical model that's fed data poops forecast. 

The problem type model well supercomputer based models ones used weather forecasting, thousands variables well random chance not/ accounted for.

It gives ballpark estimate go given situation certain known quantified parameters plugged in. Much like weather models, would technological miracle 100% accurate long range. Short answer: Trump
Long answer: Truuuuuuuuump There's certain contingent people think ""muh civil rights"" important collective safety. going answer time ask continue single sweden amongst nations *currently* experiencing tragic circumstances failures? also harping france, spain, czechia, etc? think deserve intense negative fixation either, genuinely curious exactly behind fixation. sitting leather armchair, go. 

I'd love hear prescribed endpoint is. yet hear one months sporadically spent visiting thread ~~Selling contact tracing info crime. It'd also huge scandal. ~~

Ignore that, total insanity *private businesses* allowed contact tracing T&amp;Cs, anyway.

In China, govt went unusual lengths emphasise data privacy protection contact tracing (and even then, China's contact tracing non-cases non-close-contacts way less intrusive currently employed West. e.g. there's bluetooth tracking real-time tracking). Personal information protection big concern Chinese people. Obama terrorist Yes. approved, look good. second time they've allowed bump age lower; testing young 16 1st. also speed approval use children, likely granted time healthy adults. want see reaction videos people realizing we’re ones fleeing another country turned back I'm arguing 'what if'. I'm arguing 'what is'.

We yet safe means protecting people pandemic, except staying away people.

What think flu anything else non sequitor. 

What think trying direct conversation trying 'move goal posts'.

No thanks. clinically depressed calling people ""weak"" struggling mental health caused social isolation? 

You're asshole, fam. doctor, quote doctors, look data objectively see virus behaving. 

I also assess economic financial costs mitigation better doctor profession. mentioned bit detail, city live 2 regular sized lifetimes, believe layout across US.

However, Lifetime recently acquired smaller gym ""chain"" 2 locations, completely custom much smaller traditional lifetime, also 18+. one go to, rules much enforced. 

I tried going larger one better range lower body machines, ran problem back since. couple ways - there's ""outland"" ""inland"" applications. Briefly, outland married/common law live outside Canada - either living outside Canada, non-Canadian spouse home country, etc. Inland convinced Canadian Border Services let country, apply within Canada. nuances, either. process pretty lengthy involves fairly hefty application package medical exam, etc.

I sponsored partner residency two years ago. inland- came Canada, lived together year, applied common law. process stressful felt difficult, long legitimate relationship (i.e. residency), usually seem get approved. ""Rare"" 80 million actually affected? Really? Bruh. Two days ago US Canada reported 125 cases per million people, canada reported 1.11 deaths per million US reported 0.95 deaths per million. read ""20% herd immunity"" craze back. possible combination mask wearing, social distancing, 20% population immune adds enough stop spread. R0 2.5 suppression measures cut transmission rate half reduce R 1.25 80% population still susceptible cut R 1 stops growing. relax social distancing mask wearing, factors (seasonality?) increase transmission rate, outbreak going ramp back up. infection fatality rate wesrern countries 0,5-1,0. likely st lesst 0,6 percent. originally said July August 2020 would course better informed knows talking about. Though possibility vaccines fail get hopes work perfectly get go. would really unlikely promising candidates fail, workforce money put it. probably matter time, disappointed multiple delays. Still, need *all* doom gloom. Waiting get flu shot pharmacy read this! poland, regulations masks shields... it’s crazy. US proudly calling leaders free world 70 + years title gave themselves? constant interference international affairs profit well-being ? rest world begging that? also fact US tried build empire remains Spain's long pearl Harbour? 

The thin veneer moral superiority US much eroded last 4 years current strategy deal covered.....let's say us seen morally bankrupt way Catholic church found kiddy fiddling fairness, may accurate say leading away #1 position. Como pretty relentless putting blame federal government stumbling front continuing show lack leadership point he's saying anything persuade others adopt solutions eventually reduced cases NY globally. see people like solutions may view sales pitch simple boasting. Fair enough! Well good luck mate. Getting late here. Night ! Good plans equal good results. clearly remember republican response majority black democrat city new orleans hurricane Katrina. See, Italy. article linked ridiculed whole country nowhere near reflective actual reality around day another article came Chinese doctors praising Italian response, rotfl.

Italy's response stringent peak Wuhan, around lockdown Wuhan late January mid-February, *definitely* stringent Vietnam's more. early, due bad luck major mistakes, that's made difference. initial assumptions ""eased lockdown"" utterly false driven misinformed quotes random articles. compliance rates high! people definitely also gotten fatigued slacked off, many diligent people faithfully following restrictions we've throughout affair. again, disagree assessment hold wearing masks perceived vague possibility would make people complacent social distancing hygiene, i'm suspicious it, irritated. Yes, COVID crisis perfectly illustrates utilitarianism flawed moral concept. May suggest Rawls instead. Like private plane connections Would really like answer question, rules sub specifically forbid mentioning it. they? see. makes sense. Good FDA letting white house force lower bar. Oh yeah? tell concerned experts are? Republicans still see virus enemy. There's safe way small family gathering indoors minutes. propose class action lawsuits governors perpetuated this. anyone weight would even real option somehow? Show us voted Biden well let in!! 😝 Pfizer Inc. said could seek emergency-use authorization COVID-19 vaccine U.S. late November shot shown effective large late-stage trial.

Safety reviews dictate timeline, Food Drug Administration requiring least half people study watched side effects two months. milestone achieved third week November, Pfizer Chief Executive Officer Albert Bourla said open letter published Friday company’s website.

“Let clear, assuming positive data, Pfizer apply emergency authorization use U.S. soon safety milestone achieved,” Bourla wrote. initial readout whether vaccine effective could come later month, depending quickly subjects trial -- got placebo shot -- become infected virus. gives shit Air travel 80-90 percent 
So don’t lot data 

The air flow studies look good aren’t seeing lot people sitting shoulder shoulder hours eating plane top Germany better social system people rely well helps reduce financial pressure companies well workers, already proven 2008 financial crisis. Oh yes. Look official data number new cases kind levelled 400/day sharp increase september. Breaking bad trend really nice see.  Plenty idiots Trump came around. would unironically use Cho D'dan name sci-fi story wrote 218,000 deaths wrong, asshole. that's US. Talk brainwashed sheep. Maybe took head ass know numbers learn actual facts. ""The Party Life.""

And thought state takes assholes follow rules, loved ones may able get ICU bed local hospital clogged dumbfucks totally infuriating. Get one fits properly Probably not. people get infected, likely virus mutate something different. could lower mortality, higher one. reported comment misinformation. fake news. call trolling? refute anything I've said? explain long term prospects 130% debt GDP climbing deficits is? call trolling, I'm trying get people actually prepare rather blindsided. know anyone favors? Creating expectations recovery materialize. touch subject “The Social Dilemma” Netflix. Couldn’t recommend watching enough. spread seven right now, dropping eight days ago That’s you, going inward discover want be, spent time alone college really embraced enjoyed environment (I went college different region I’m from, beautiful area lots outdoors) Sweden probably best example country explicitly aimed herd immunity. failure. country since changed don’t trust people lie

Then must really trust liar chief right? guy's lied 20 thousand times since becoming president. lie downplayed want anyone ""panic"" real dozy right?  Reason many believe word comes CDC Especially USA baseline cases much higher. 2,6 million active cases never dropped. one confirmed death reinfection far suppose discovered. Yeah, let clear: really care look us ""leadership"". took role Pearl Harbor thrust us hung around long.

Perfectly content trade peacefully world, occasionally visit, otherwise enjoy North America.

Good luck w/ China though saves Trump! miracle cure...
Vitamin answer, also...don't obese sick. - want to. control basic identity beliefs. information aware disclosure effect. always suspicious conflicts interests government officials and, despite good opinion Dr Fauci pandemic, troubled continued promotion Remdesivir despite data early lackluster saying nothing things good data on. enough say financial ties, position many administrations means he's learned get along. disappointment stems continued promotion novel therapeutics muted things like Vitamin would easy cheap implement. stupid people age categories. cannot blame young people, ignorant old people too. i'm afraid that. hope 538 right predictions. so, result one state matter, hell result decisive two three states question actually change final result would best point correct, think death numbers bit high. 1-2M probably correct US 70% infected reach level herd immunity.

Some points mention though 1-2M would heavily weighted towards older people. Many (maybe majority) families would end impacted parent grandparent COVID death.

Another point looks death outcome. learn every day even people live may end longer (lifetime still unknown) term issues. second highest, three away record October 8th. hospitals starting run room cases.

Hang butts abortion would good abortion.

Edit: context, I'm adult male. high risk pregnancy. Doctors advised mother abort risk life.

She warped view Christianity.

She 38 time three children already, ranging 6-12 years old. Along multiple prior miscarriages.

She risked leaving children motherless virtually bedridden father bipolar addicted opioids.

She risked book.

We survived, multiple mental issues, including Autism Spectrum Disorder, PTSD, CPTSD, social general anxiety disorders, treatment resistant major depressive disorder suicidal ideation.

All went undiagnosed 30s. got autism diagnosis July.

I say again, abortion would good abortion. Awesome. Glad see moving along. equinox September 22nd. saying one month daytime gotten much shorter Paris already cold/flu season? think that's stretch. Sorry he’s still asshole contributing fuckery Trump administration. go back ICU call families FaceTime stay goodbyes peasants couldn’t get monoclonal antibodies saved life.  Yeah people understand minimum required shoot much higher Like deep closet; South Park R Kelly deep? LOL bar never high human being. Yeah, think vaccine probably safe, biggest challenge usually allergy reaction it’s easy get spotted, 6 candidates usually option. safety problem usually comes manufacturing, storage, storage administration, vaccine R&amp;D hero need person available. donut-guzzling fat fuck survive covid, makes feel better chances. Thanks! I’m really excited I’ll definitely keep mind! places check out? Remdesivir used frequently treat covid. part standard treatment protocol US hospitals cases progress beyond mild. grew up, folks wouldn’t trust shouldn’t touch electric fence, touch see. 
We called em dummies dipshits. 
I guess call em politicians 🐢 nobody wants hear this. like stick fingers ears try everything confront unfortunate truth: undoing. know forecast models accurate? curious! unprepared swine flu whatever like 08-09ish, response stocked up, supplies expired happened. We're proactive country. would good reason worry economy number people dying. People important profits know, surrender right? nope, masks even full face shields shields go nose down... 

basically zero protection wearer people around person shield. lots people. 

specially krakow almost every retail/grocery worker saw mask nose. along lots people without mask strolling around.

there seems nothing done it. city/government really made idiots don’t really care much all.


edit: look stats poland, went 300-400 day MONTHS 3 month long total lock 8,000+ day within 2 weeks. krakow described local doctors “poland’s lombardi” positive rate literally nobody gives shit... it’s really, really crazy. people say it’s big deal, it’s flu, “plandemic” protests every weekend masks. protest of, before, masks grocery stores public transport. called communism masks grocery stores public transport... really changed opinion education poland. honestly cannot believe read, easily softest thing EVER. hide house rest life .01 percent chance die corona, goodness. Sorry people actually wanna live lives scared common cold. Ohio Vermont 1.25, faster spreading state? ever PR situation   mean back bad?  W realize governors make decisions state, right? counties decide whether follow guidelines, cities decide whether override certain policies. TRULY think president United States ability even power single-handedly control things severely ignorant. realize makes feel good blame trump everything bad. guess would fine also gave credit everything good. Regardless, reading do. mean, people taxed for? chances pretty high Hillary emailed she’ll pay $100K hide Benghazi house. Ohio Vermont 1.25, faster spreading state? mean, people taxed for? mean, people taxed for?

Our states called it. 

I fail see comparison failed. 

For months abject failures Europe shining wonder. 

It appears not. wealth, yes. scrutinized hard enough, could see America prepared pandemic. good public health system. universal healthcare.

It appears not.  huge effort! talk reinfection antibodies lasting 3 months, covid basically track cycle common cold. looney talk? get vaccinated every 3 months next several years? mean, I’m okay so. didn’t think possible vaccinate something like cold. Uhm would that? may months freak vaccine, would spend months listening experts? Low compared rest world?? aren’t low. low compared places badly. America alone: dozens millions unemployed, $6T excess defiicit, 80MM children educations severely compromised bad pscyhological effects hundreds millions.

All really accomplish nothing since virus marches inexorable unstoppably contagious

The costs distancing exceed benefits orders magnitude, something Fauci take account care about. anxiety problems too. ive heard doctors dismissing things anxiety looked further. meeting dead EUA perspective FDA added 2 months trial safety data requirement. going say. R U P better lol hate break guys, US herd immunity strategy right now. may want to, are. else could 7 continuous months sustained community transmission highly contagious virus called? outcome there? become Korea tomorrow? 

Might well skew herd immunity toward young toward old. big advancement public health harm reduction rather elimination. aren’t going eliminate prostitution, let’s distribute condoms, can’t eliminate hard drug use, let’s make sure clean needles etc. Age based protection simply realizing can’t eliminate cause harm, reduce impact. names ? doesn’t make sense 4 people 10k actually died Covid - must something lot telling us admit also mandated. Because... masks mostly protect everyone else, really see point one else it. Winter coming. best Jericho cant help smile crowd singing along theme. tell truly appreciates it! Trump republicans, Trump. Well, nothing creates positive feedback loop people become relaxed, think pandemic subsiding (when really isn't), become even *more* relaxed, on. time becomes even harder implement restrictions. Thankfully Pfizer expected seek authorization November highest-risk getting protected then. guy represents comprehension level Harvard Law graduates school gone hill. Can't even read short article comprehend it. Oh no, care now. want natural herd immunity. downvoted? suspending rights little worth save lives? saves one life arrests worth it. imagine ""muh freedumbs"" type brigading certain sub. saying handwashing soap removes viruses remove 100% viruses hands, argument making handwashing killing virus - kills kill 100% them.
