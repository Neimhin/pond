0,2021-08-15," messed (and I've heard MANY similar stories, never considered nursing, going doctor instead ironically, wanted study treat viruses...) Also, tend see pretty date shit taught nursing schools....you need touch bare skin always asked clothes regular doc literally never ever issue: http://anesthesiaexperts.com/uncategorized/difference-auscultation-clothing-skin/ Idk man. Curve slope appears starting round out. hope doesn‚Äôt get high. - don‚Äôt want people listen experts CDC - - still get vaccinated. 

The science changes per experts CDC - didn‚Äôt back Spring said didn‚Äôt everyone apparently known better.

And people selfish simply wanting go ‚Äúselfish lives‚Äù - apparently - also includes 6 year old. 

I literally said I‚Äôm wearing mask indoors needed despite liking it. SHOCK - I‚Äôm 6 old here. don‚Äôt like masks can‚Äôt wait need anymore.

And SHOCK - still listen experts unlike anti vaxxers do. Father 3 7 yo. Want keep believing anything, Majority data based Alpha. Delta changing game I‚Äôm worried Yep, confirming everything said intact true‚Ä¶from experience.
Brain fog far worst; feel though dementia I‚Äôm 34 lol.
God bless Thank do. I'm sorry society give crap health, safety, quality life, even non-pandemic times.   Wow horrible, wish masks vaccines daughter starts school tomorrow need make quick decision pulling public school. Frankly wouldn‚Äôt care skip year. going shit show within weeks I‚Äôm mostly worried long Covid, especially children school reopening. wife don‚Äôt kids 3 young nephews parents ‚Äúover Covid.‚Äù

I think make Delta surge new variants we‚Äôll good shape. *smoking garden. Also drinking tho    Let‚Äôs try again. study back statement shouldn‚Äôt offer uneducated opinion. 

The risk/reward may seem like much real risk child dies icu covid. using ‚Äúit‚Äôs flu‚Äù argument child‚Äôs life. Well barely understand covid itself‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs onky year half. mean really expect understand long Covid small time span? It‚Äôs review article (not research) mainly cites author‚Äôs decades old work provides zero evidence integration genetic material host genome either adenoviral vector mRNA vaccines.  really want get vaccine toddler, I'm preempt least emergency authorization.  Constitutions commerce clause widely interpreted Long lived family ! FDA really pissing delay approval 12 vaccine. Schools going COVID nests next couple weeks. social distancing.

Don‚Äôt care faith anti-vaxxers anymore though. point, I‚Äôm ticked occupying hospital bed could go someone deserving. means getting America path justice happiness peace us I'm it. like Lukashenko dictator Belarus saying April 2020. vampires. Checkmate, mortal.  COVID zero sounds great realize longterm solution. Unless New Zealand wants keep quarantining people 14 days come country big tourism industry eventually going bleed economically. realistic solution vaccinate many people willing let unvaccinated deal consequences bad decision making (kids need vaccinated first though) Two thumbs   testing

That sounds like entire classes sent home positive case sniffles. crazy mass test children adult population vaccinated - leads disruption. eligibility asplenics? know saw CDC briefing day. lol, right?! concern enforcement. real enforcement mask mandates, real consequences breaking lockdown rules. I'm tired half measures. Winter coming! win it! Exactly. say otherwise I‚Äôm order to, know, save lives, they‚Äôd turn political career would over. 

Can‚Äôt that. Bring body bags instead. fellow GOP explain pro-life?  great post. sounds like T-Cell response wins war? NZ recommending 6 week gap, got first shot 10/08/2021. sweet spot taking T-Cell response account, 4 week gap? Thanks Florida ranks 3rd¬†in nation K-12 Achievement according new¬†[2020 Quality Counts report by¬†Education move 4th¬†in 2019 highest ranking ever K-12 Achievement Sunshine Bunch small-town pizza lawyers TXSC. Pretty sure people Mississippi agree him. sad country come to.  Serious question: pro-life? Osama bin Laden‚ÄîArabic doesn‚Äôt transliterate Osama Usama correct. CIA translators used ‚ÄúU‚Äù describing initials initials ‚ÄúUBL‚Äù usually used many bad decisions long  sounds like prime candidate. Stay healthy Reddit stranger! I'm bit confused? upvotes/downvotes, seems like people think disagreeing me?

I explicitly said sending kids school.

However, also implement basic public health measures make schools safe possible. Yep, really nice rude her, told family members risk Delta rise want take chances. tell knows one issue here, least. sure going go asked, to! fucking expensive lol

I make 100k year I'm balling anything

I love here, got beaches world class cities amenities, fuck....I feel much nicer house new car goddamn hard work much wife make combined lol

Its great place young family, good schools, tons things do, 40s looking toward retirement place unless legitimately wealthy imo worst part childfree morons squealing CHOSE KIDS WOULDNT WANT SPEND EVERY WAKING MOMENT ‚Ä¶ well sorry buddy, choose also teachers child care options ever. Humans weren‚Äôt meant 24/7 care offspring ALONE (the nuclear family fairly new thing instance opposed extended community helping care children). There‚Äôs literally nobody want spend every waking moment with, even beloved family, lol Really wondering would better courts went allowed mask mandates. could blame activist judges also benefit lower transmission. Desantis really painted corner freaky anti-public health policies shit getting control Delta.   insane. pro-life? New republican theme song 2021 revealed: ""Dare Stupid."" Oh, plan continuing wait. blood work done weeks 2nd shot done times since check levels. antibodies dropped bit significant enough worried needing booster yet.  kidding man. get people option I'm seeing people options attend fucking house parties kids I'm left stunned link it?  know sniffles killed children. Llama, Lambda‚Ä¶ got connection! even read trash listicle posted first?? blend k-12 higher Ed. Since take time, here's info Lol Florida ranked 27th pre-k 12th grade 1st higher education.

So yay. k-12 sort trash, even terrible nonsense article. New New York ranked 25th pre-k 12th grade 15th higher education.

So better Florida lol. New York city's public high schools produced dozens Nobel winners Florida's produced 0: yeah - rust belt education going absolute shit. Taking average place excellent public schools exist large margin sort dumb. Ft Lauderdale leading way Florida nothing special - able produce mediocre grads attract better college students! folks far pro-life could throw them. They'll let kids die illusion freedom. Everyone catch Covid (probably multiple times) lives - luckily vaccines means probably even realise impact life. infectious widespread suppressed thought got Trump office?? üíÄüòÇ exactly talking about?

I acknowledge science changed I‚Äôm back taking reasonable precautions like wearing masks indoors public spaces, eating outdoors restaurants, going huge events. stating wasn‚Äôt selfish time ditching masks time experts said time OK. science changed now, time, changed back too. - exactly said wrong time? listened experts science? happy semblance normality seemed horizon DIDN‚ÄôT enjoy living way?

I happy masks back, willing comply fully science says otherwise - nothing wrong liking them. like seeing people fully uncomfortable - necessary seems now. moment get expert green light- yes - I‚Äôll glad Ditch again.

You throw term ‚Äúsocial distancing‚Äù say don‚Äôt expect people live like hermits. Perhaps explain exactly social distancing fully vaxxed person (that makes behavior selfish)? pretty much believe I‚Äôm finding healthy balance - seeing fully vaxxed friends wearing masks. 

Again - Reddit throw labels you‚Äôd like people - board become cesspool endless bitterness. People literally called selfish enjoying life pandemic despite still working protect public. Definitely gate keeping nursing degree programs. explicitly told quarter enrolled RN program would weeded out. failed ass ‚Äútaking blood pressure high arm‚Äù ‚Äúauscultating bowel, lung, heart sounds patients gown‚Äù clinical final exam focused health assessment. ‚Äòpatient‚Äô girlfriend volunteered partner clinical exam. refused lift gown allow touch stethoscope bare skin strangers present due anxiety never went away molested child. Tried explain whole circumstance exam proctor didn‚Äôt care. Failing clinical exam immediate termination nursing program. So.. helped meet quota. think attitude ""better nothing"" applies. slap masks grocery store whatnot case, bother family party etc. vaxxed, mask grocery store hurt ice cream sales cause temperature rise. Great read. Summaries lot studies without getting deep weeds.

The last section, section 6, long covid, questions answers. Also, snowbird retirees north right now.  Why? Vaccinated teachers/children/parents generally low risk hospitalisation. UK thankfully rolling back elements mass testing schools means less disruption. Hopefully countries follow adult population high vaccine uptake. Children cannot afford miss anymore school Sniffles, 11-15% children Covid long-term health issues impact school performance, statistics Delta variant appeared. Pride goeth fall. mean, fair, behavior didn‚Äôt come NOWHERE. CDC initially said pretty much risk vaccinated people spreading Covid governments businesses lifted mask mandates ‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs really hard close box you‚Äôve opened it.    get paid weekly that's $200. Every week $100. near enough. CDC? organization changes direction every month? wanted people get vaccinated, carrot. hoping would play out, Delta changed game.
Is sufferable put mask walking Costco? Nobody asking folks lock home. hold mass partying like COVID make small effort control spread.
I seriously doubt cause mental suffering anyone.

The kids still protected. can't get vaccinated. 6 year old wants break free too. broke tears found getting vaccine still can't get one. wants go school without mask. wants go theme parks movie theaters. wants get together friends home.
If wait, think reasonable expect adults same? Yes realize whole ""flatten curve"" become laughing matter. want ""live covid"" let's least wait everyone chance getting vaccinated. January 1st 2020 Illinois became legal, talk perfect timing. Unfortunately lambda already thing. Dint know worse way there. definitely hoping get far enough ahead thing make like flu. Yearly vaccine to. Yes, agree. However, say teacher mom Covid hell parents kids. school situation abysmal going 3rd year. Kids quarantine making work near impossible families need incomes most, etc. Kids sacrificed much, given much think least society could wait little bit longer opening floodgates fun, maybe could school disrupted constantly. 

I‚Äôm fed tell. It‚Äôs second week school I‚Äôve got 9 kids quarantined week. almost comical... idiots spending trillions dumb war, dummies understand science, ever long list things would never get fix... education, climate, etc.  Even vaccine stored 70 degrees farenheit still get uptake US. many people willing get vaccine one reason another. Unfortunately idea likely made kids well. sure sure, problem end, that's ticket  small thing slow won‚Äôt it. doctors walk em masse truly want attention. Sorry, anti-vaxxers/anti-maskers‚Ä¶you‚Äôre own. Ha ha officially recommended I'd take hard look preliminary data available, think people would find unjustified think 2nd dose mRNA worth long odds problem, especially similar AZ vaccine, know combines good mRNA ones. Pfizer already failing 6 months delta, way looking booster J&amp;J.  fucking morons. call message incoherent extreme understatement.   Yes, mean say vaccines work vaccines taken. meant whatever done, failed prevent hospitals overwhelmed let's look options.  extrapolate exponential growth 2 data points? Literally. accidentally found way FB group people planning getting vaxxed making covid worse hoping turns country wide crisis blame Biden run 2022. knew fucking gardening group one step removed types people? fetus poor people minorities. Read article. mentions black men women, Hispanic men women, also another notable group increase alcohol consumption, women young children. Buddy, people different. , like you, feel thing sometimes forget take alone(I fell asleep mask on). knew friends literally can't breath thing. get sub train need ""take breath"". moved Texas Portland March variety political, cultural, political reasons. garbage solidifying made good call. 

My friends think crazy moving here, end day homelessness violence Portland dealt point, amount stupid Texas forever. project involves reaching different people, always happens. reach certain point slows down. I'm sure 20% vaccinated think one thing multitude things. need figure reasons come strategy address individually. people busy? Make convenient coming them. language cultural barriers?  Go door door racialized areas, accompanied someone speaks language. Involve community leaders church groups. vaccine-hesitant? Involve primary doctors. young unconcerned? Reach hang out. Treat vaccine like promotion new club. Pass around pamphlets give prizes.

We going reach 90% passively waiting people come. I'm sure small minority anti-vaxxer budge. think lot people reached, proper effort put it.

I'm vaccine-hesitant dragging feet second dose pharmacy called asked wanted book appointment   hate ppl site wiki Chileans aren‚Äôt really fond travelers since pandemic started, borders still closed (because Delta), that‚Äôs now, recently validate international vaccine certificates least that. I‚Äôd wait couple months things still going well borders reopen, you‚Äôre responsible COVID, go it. knew right? Last year wearing mask every situation. would sit toilet home still keep mask on. feel thing there. 

&amp;#x200B;

But year taking several months, put mask back, feel like breathing mask unbearable. really strange. falling apart seems shit gets bolstered parent color, ""hey also racism ontop that"" question gotta ask is, Phil feel lucky? haha fuck  Agreed, unfortunately Khamenei, ""supreme leader"", first last word everything inside Iran. Let's hope temporary ! sister might permanent loss smell category. hear heartbeat right ear. still amazes Kentucky states Democratic Governor. state gave us Mitch McConnell Rand Paul. worst Senators we've ever gotten. 99% insane! hardly anti-vaxer vax hesitant? month day care kids sick?

In Jan 2020, bad sickness spread son‚Äôs (6th) grade. Xmas break multiple kids grade visiting family Asia. many kids ill. son bad sore throat woke one night sobbing hysterical tears. took strep test next day &amp; ‚Ä¶ nothing. flu either. slept couch 2 weeks fever. 

One classmates got sick &amp; spread whole family. youngish healthy grandma caught &amp; stood &amp; walked living room &amp; dropped dead. Another classmate sick dad &amp; hallucinating. dad coughed hard injured himself. diagnoses kids/families.

Idk, virus? Yet, family, son super sick‚Ä¶ seemed strange. Definitely severe virus that‚Äôs house. First walgreens: failed. gave much info able look up.

Second walgreens: succeeded, think ID previous address (and give phone number). questions asked.

Overall takeaway: claim ID. try one Walgreens. Chances high succeed. Moderna Gang Rise Up! country literally falling apart mostly fault. I'm scientist, could explain great detail ""natural immunity"" good vaccine, save time I'll send link article director NIH (and personal hero):  made interesting point podcast. feels like provincial governments Canada using hospitalizations vaccination main metrics now. Vincent always ambivalent heard immunity anyway. 

The amount people lying third dose also interesting. white male drinks lately, I‚Äôm outraged excluded! Rejoice guys, today law won. Maybe pandemic kill lots people have, imagine law upheld and... urm... complete anarchy happened! Like, judges suddenly became crazy anarchists! üé∂Every time makes laughüé∂ Brazil also amazing job reaching people HIV medicating them, even remote jungles. problem is, people damn state agree him. want mask mandates lock downs. Living like living another world. fun. We‚Äôre pulling 350 reported COVID deaths day states, we‚Äôre 550 excess deaths day normal. Meaning additional 200 people likely dying indirect pandemic related titled race focused title? Could said women children. guiding principles established Expert Vaccine Allocation Panel ensure State Texas swiftly distributes COVID-19 vaccine Texans voluntarily choose immunized,"" said Governor [Abbott] said Texas ‚Äúpast time government mandates‚Äù ‚Äúinto time personal responsibility.‚Äù

The kind POS that.... 

Stands freedom personal responsibility? ü§î feeling would loud proud numbers good. planning trip Chile went down. think October Chile cool travel to? determined kill people, charming, point actively preventing safety precautions criminal?

Like, many people getting sick dying governors weird-hill-to-die-on policies? 

And can‚Äôt hold politicians accountable decisions lead peoples‚Äô deaths? It‚Äôs like one foresee could possibly deaths decisions; decisions made recommendations every major infectious disease expert advisory group.

This man going kill people. He‚Äôs going kill children. he‚Äôs threatening financially harm anyone tries stop him.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  tell wear mask boosters places checking state database. could find one kept looking though.

You still need prepared lie say immunocompromised, I'd even specific lie ready case. verifying. hit nail head. live MS. youngest graduates 4 years, we're moving. anything, shown stupid people are. school district requires masks, actually enforcing them, parents losing minds. They've already board meeting trying get overthrown. Everyone thinks choice... Covid real... flu... bestie's kid school 3 days got quarantined. require masks, he's young vaccinated. could well end one dead kids people idiots. We're vaccinated house. Everyone thinks we're completely nuts. care. I'll anything, ANYTHING protect kids asthmatic husband. know teens begging parents let get vaccine, let them. can't go get since they're 18. many kids smarter parents. frustrating. I'm mad time. hate living here. big branch family Sao Paolo, glad light tunnel finally horizon guys. 

I‚Äôm Canada, massive vaccine push kicked middle big surge spring, swear could feel mood country lift vaccination number every day, hope feeling same! 

Also, looks like we‚Äôre going tap somewhere around 85% (which okay, great) - nothing buy deep respect Brazil‚Äôs public health teams success. religious wingnut last one talk scientific matters don‚Äôt believe people one second. I‚Äôm sure experience normal one. know. There‚Äôs vaccine mandate city taking effect tomorrow. Many people job going quit rather comply.

The answer vaccine mandates, problem enough people want vaccine.

It‚Äôs hard justify another shut down/more stimulus, etc. stop healthcare system collapsing vaccines widely available awaiting imminent full FDA approval. haha. suck it, DeSantis shit eating mantis  Chilean leftie agree everything say. Chile really succeeded vaccination program (mostly Sinovac), everything slowly reopening, elders immunocompromised Sinovac already started getting third Astrazeneca shot international press hasn‚Äôt said anything good things are. 83% adults two doses, still mask mandates nobody complaining it.  Cases low fuck feels good. Yeah, bunch stuff like Canada: outdoor pop ups, one-day mega vaccine drives sports centres (this one super fun, city felt like party day: etc. 

Lots public health education promotion vaccines next politicization, US media still leaks bunch across Canadian border (+ we‚Äôve always super fringe left right factions anti vax era). 

We‚Äôre 82% vaccinated 12+ population, solid ideal, every percentage point going hella grind. 

Brazil‚Äôs public health team known world class decades, clearly going next-level vaccine efforts, nothing awe respect achievement. clearly different defintion nanny state means regards goverment relation people. force [these get vaccinated? isn‚Äôt voting republicans get killed. wait. that.  ‚ÄúMaybe vaccine would helped fight it, don‚Äôt know would completely stopped it,‚Äù 20-year-old son, Tre Burrows, said.

it would helped, probably would completely stopped it, too. better luck next time. would effective point came said China created virus kill Americans way fight back (pew pew pew) AMERICAN MADE vaccine. come variant specific booster, well we'll probably need another 6 months anyway.  aware new variant, vaccinated could still transmit virus.

The vaccinated could still transmit strains well, breakthrough cases begin Delta likely transmissible Delta is.  Don‚Äôt poison ocean! creatures living ocean done wrong! would make citizens suffer. incredibly hard people laid get unemployment Georgia. Folks approved never received check. COVID, state Georgia sued issue food stamps according USDA rules &amp; regulations. backpay benefits. Georgia want initiate children's healthcare program. federal government threaten &amp; fine state get Peachcare Kids running. Georgia bad habit reallocating money earmarked social services. I'm quite certain Florida same.

If feds, citizens Florida, Georgia, Mississippi, states would worse already are. feds step people aware. people like me? 100% vaccinated, still support 100% freedom. choice, one made me.

If want it, get it... rate early October peak? really really care. bother them. US likely peak soon. may final wave. comments article pretty dim. thankful family help little bit! Every little thing counts!

My laws live across country we‚Äôve twice now, father barely take care himself, let alone baby. I‚Äôd kill close family support. aren‚Äôt meant raise child two people. likely less 2 weeks. Sure, 50% lot compared what's needed stop slow exponential growth. I'm guessing states mingling much.  learn anything?  Anti vax ideology go well Brazil. Here, people love:

1. Free stuff 
2. people doing

3. something post cool photo social media. what's interesting despite being"" florida"" controversy, actually 50% vaccinated states. Large elderly population wealthier populations got vaxxed soon could. can‚Äôt view deadline :(

my apologies Thanks. Yeah UK they're advising 2 month wait shots unfortunately, got first last week. gets hot/muggy/harder breathe work job physical tasks. That's issue least. still wear one even though I'm vaccinated, sometimes need step aside take breather sometimes wait opportunity suck. It‚Äôs literally answered first paragraph. amount time typed could used reading 3 sentences. know people seem forget long covid effects. Kids too. ""sniffle"". forget unvaccinated family members kids go back home to. sob!!! could rage read things like one strongest public healthcare systems world extensive focus vaccination even pandemic.

Pretty much 27 EU members stronger public healthcare systems Brazil does. city EU vaccination rate anywhere high. 1.2 MILLION people Sao Paolo live slums, yet city managed vaccinate 99.2% entire adult population? possible. There‚Äôs type two diabetes pandemic readily available free type two diabetes vaccine available. contagious spread innocent immunocompromised people young children. reddit son. Every post, every comment everybody fucking lane.  Grow then. except illegal withhold pay, eventually Florida pay it. would assume via withholdings federal funding something.

So, he'll say good, kicking road later probably settled lawsuit. fucking Florida later. Yeah states database based name/DOB wait .. biggest jump since march 2020? Independent School Districts allowed independent. Wait, would ""strict compliance [with mask mandates] [...] way prevent, hinder, delay necessary action coping disaster""?!? second thought back 2020 headline. Brazil one strongest public healthcare systems world extensive focus vaccination even pandemic.

2018 almost 4 years ago. governor state mayor Sao Paulo (who recently died cancer) strongly come Bolsonaro since main proponents vaccine research/sourcing country.

So yeah, maybe instead xenophobic uninformed go ahead barest minimum amount research next time. surprised. That‚Äôs stuff like MERS didn‚Äôt start pandemic. It‚Äôs way lethal facilitate spread therefore fit spread like delta, transmissible kills delay does. Chileans racist following Pandemic? sound like Chile know Nah, don‚Äôt really antivaxers. Everyone know really really wanted vaccine ASAP since beginning year. People trying cut line‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs another story probably country, least end everyone gets shots‚Ä¶ 
We might lot trouble getting folks fully vaccinated tho, lot uninformed people think one shot enough, don‚Äôt even know vaccine got simply don‚Äôt know supposed take two doses, especially among poorer areas around country Well lot conservative politicians/media pundits/citizens seem believe everyone toxic are, constantly ""gotta get em get ME"" mentality. cannot fathom opponents want see suffer families suffer. I'm fully vaccinated Pfizer. friends getting Moderna due pre-print study showing Moderna seems prevent break cases much Pfizer. thoughts random internet people? 

Most seem think vaccine mixing safe studies. Pfizer Moderna mRNA seems safe? want know vaccinated people get tested mild symptoms higher rate, could really fueling breakthrough hype. know would likely get tested make sure symptoms weren‚Äôt related vaccination.  til every last person vaxxed receives 10th booster, right?? That's good point, stubbornness ""right"" til end. Although, another component could religious among Covid deniers antivaxxers hyper focused ""leaving god's hands"" heavenly afterlife lose sight life living now. That, mixed need secret information one else knows plus misguided idea freedom makes toxic cocktail someone given modicum introspection. money nonrefundable, like every college last year.  hell nurses fly texas states TRYing protect citizens. Texas Florida politicians trying kill citizens get government help??? Federal money??? likely end pocket helping people all. airline travel isn‚Äôt targeted *least* requiring full proof negative Covid testing? vaccination rate staff, faulty students? ""If want kids mask around kid, there's always charter schools...""  *so* prepared write ""not proudest fap"" can't, except context I'm pointing definitely fappage going on. N-95 les comfortable. Teachers speaking mask gets moist. I‚Äôm teacher. Luckily teach community college get breaks. entire country alligators fight! got this! Seriously? wife nurse dealing stuff since beginning. Administration hospital seen 20 nurses staff leave due poor working conditions, haven‚Äôt even posted positions since ‚Äúcosts high right now.‚Äù give employee appreciation day cookout, guess hotdog makes failure handling things. Republucans dying 2-to-1 covid?

If point? National shutdown last year. fact president tweeting ‚Äúliberate‚Äù states whose Governors called lockdowns. Governors southern states need grow act like leaders: call masks, stay home, vaccines. It‚Äôs great see Brazil finally well! It‚Äôs sad took long president buy vaccines, vaccinated whole country now. consolation always people would actually get shots unlike US. still long way go tho. country quite far behind Sao Paulo. city still vaccinating 25+ predictions reach 18 Tell 400 kids already passed Covid. heard many kids ventilators bc ""sniffles"". move Florida moronic pal DeSantis. Great, want puke afraid, either unable unwilling. Yep, 7% better state. 
We primed absolutely unleash fall.  
I‚Äôm glad immediate area 80% vaccinated. 
Should help mitigate local impact‚Ä¶ maybe. That's everybody else done. Oh man that‚Äôs horrible. You‚Äôre far young ending posts ‚ÄúGod bless‚Äù already. sure I'm getting voted hard restating cdc Fauci said this. thinking ""Freedom free"" suppose converse Hell yeah. problem get sick well life/health worth $9222 week?! containment virus even going rest site would decon outside? that? gonna stupid, gotta tough (at least citizens texas be, especially kids 12) numbers know related covid assume overall death toll much higher. hope wrong think right.  think fear. got hit first wave couple weeks ago fear roof. overseas I'm exactly sure. doctors make 
Exactly. virus begins turn something contagious deadlier, easier contain kills infects even faster. Covid supposed stick us forever, worth virus problematic still virus. get bike. understand way though.

Considering AZ generates among lowest number antibodies available vaccines, makes sense assume candidate less effective. Additionally, handed pandemic well recent spike control, there's really way conduct RCT within borders. Concerning considering 80%+ Californian adults got least one vaccine dose. Congratulations her! I‚Äôm heading externship next month. told us offered take one day training hired endüôÅ. Sounds like bandaid bullet wound. 

I‚Äôd surprised buys anytime beyond predicted failure Saturday. US least 20% loud, annoying, dangerous. absolute pain deal with. would cause immune suppressed person low lymphocytes 2nd vaccine inflammation weeks? non-American, yes.

Also, put odds happening heat death universe 0% Sadly, pre-Delta stats. picture that‚Äôs emerging Delta rosy. Vaccination still highly protective severe disease, efficacy vs infection could 40-70%. symptomatic vaccine breakthrough cases transmitting (not sure asymptomatic vaccine breakthroughs yet). Same. Same. Covid. 

I'm fully vaxxed, bad, toddler Covid monster I'm still sick. idea bad it'll get her, also infant. Shit fucked up. Great, repubs going anti mandate states make difference federally. Lady Angels, looks like clearing supply closet bereavement room first floor. staff inundated COVID patients, also whole families seven 10 people walking asking COVID tests, took precious space.

Migrant families?  I've mentioned couple times. can't even come together prevent consequences two weeks future. There's absolutely way happens consequences two decades away. 

We hosed species. So, NY definitely peaked, right? polio vaccin mandatory Belgium, might still explain hospitalisations children 2 deaths among underage entire pandemic 1.1 million confirmed cases. Pfizer 3 week waiting period. go back next week got first shot last week? would go mask times keep distance. Eat room another place away people. fact.

You're saying evidence December. sit it? add fact cruiseships, tourist port cities ocean, dont great access hospitals  Trump smart, could used unite country, rally common enemy, get re-elected based national pride. he's not. instead saw shutdowns hotels said ""enough"" politicized it.

Now Biden administration smarter this, would made stimulus based vaccine stairs way needed heal economy allowing things safe again. Instead states occasionally offering things own. 

Trump made political, Biden done little make things better saying get vaccinated allowing kids 3 feet apart schools instead 6.

No one done great job here. still difficult accept major party's ideology boils to, ""If like it, real."" Well, ya fuckin' say.   That's odd ""standard"". measured % antibody vs AstraZeneca vaccine.
But finish phase III see number stands. Yes, can. Everything happens unvaccinated still happen vaccinated, including death catching covid. statement vaccines work means bad things happen much lower rate.

The vaccines work extremely well hospitalizations, still cannot completely eliminate possibility getting severely ill even death. antihistamines steroids affect vaccine ticket discount vaccinated. you‚Äôre it, away ridiculous fees.

Service charge unvaccinated ticket holder oblivion. reasons aren‚Äôt entirely clear, mutations make coronavirus variants resistant antibodies may also make less contagious. ‚ÄúAs get one property may gain something, may lose something time,‚Äù Greene Even variants shown resistance antibodies aren‚Äôt able fully escape vaccines, signs cellular immune response ‚Äî way cells B cells fight serious disease ‚Äî much durable antibodies, experts way, infectious disease experts say, hardly matters virus contagious flu chickenpox measles ‚Äî variant might contained mix vaccination, social distancing masks. Yes lot people going without health insurance. Insurance exchange expensive. MANY us Texans don‚Äôt love shit. GOP leadership, eat shit up. Sandy Hook entered chat   Fauci president. Look progressed last summer / fall. We‚Äôre exact trend. China absolutely politicized virus weeks. pretended like big deal, even massive feasts, right couldn‚Äôt avoid longer.

After shut everything down, built hospitals ten days, mobilized military, got PPE production stood up, billion things fight virus.

They definitely tried politicize away first though.

The US, keeps trying politicize virus away, doesn‚Äôt work.

China learned lesson, US much, that‚Äôs China top US lifetimes. Prednisone every day indefinitely guess.  got prescription it‚Äôs limited time... Except end starting. happened me. got gerd months vaccination told people got sick. go ‚Äúit‚Äôs vaccine‚Äù incredibly dumb, like know got sick things don‚Äôt even go together. Yet stick tin foil hats. guess age group estimated death rate per infection? Happens every day. Make sure job hop every two three years. causes work shootings... Definitely go Well first change hospital's name president vehemently racist. think apply school nurse‚Äôs offices (if they‚Äôre licensed), though, based OSHA ETS released June.  Hah, saw right posting. I'm glad i'm alone i'm feeling stuck again. Court also signaling regardless results trial, going uphold mandates schools kids get fucked already. 

While surprise least corrupt fucks, signals referring to? 

Just issuing stay itself? r/LifeProTip country similar law. Careful, fit blue narrative. look individuals age 12, find rare kids age 12 anything sniffles. happen time time? Sure does,‚Äù Reeves said news conference Friday.

Friday.

That would Friday, August 13th 2021.

Almost two years once-in-a-lifetime global pandemic, get sociopathic state governors representing willfully ignorant constituents living richest country world.

This hopefully shameful day Reeves family. mean, nonsense look metrics make sense. Per 100,000 residents, 14 infected states, 12 states ran republican governors 2 ran democratic governors. 

Now look vaccination efforts, top 10 vaccinated state, 8 democratic governors 2 ran republican governors.

It really political i'm pointing fingers made way so, clearing things. I‚Äôd like see insurance companies deny coverage don‚Äôt get vaccine end ICU COVID.. logic apply ways. wind beneath wings. got second shot way back January, useful info.

Ration care vaccinated let unvaccinated die yeah im aiming 6 month mark myself. october hits we'll see everything playing 3rd booster seems likely What‚Äôs secret? get people buy vaccination. Asking friend Well, i'm cleared get booster shot dreading it. feel like people despise i'm sitting hesitating. I've never felt sicker second dose. GP recommended go ER called in, writhing pain, ask advice. 

I know i'm going end getting it, really hate lesser 2 evils still pretty fucking evil, least (don't get discouraged, anyone reading this, i'm one know that's reaction lol luck). pandemic got quit drinking I've glass wine go meal every months, binged since last August.

I could read linked article before, found translation. still impression field station. concert city center. much easier sort thing Sinovac, AstraZeneca, Johnson&amp;Johnson vaccines. flu shot bring building work in. get flu shots every pharmacy every clinic. Pfizer places cold storage.

There extremely remote areas USA. time seems impact greymatter/critical thinking. weaponized idiocy gonna new level. don‚Äôt get trying still. normal people followed crazies haven‚Äôt gotten yet resent him. need creative endorsements target different demographics. Abbott's actions selfish defy description. refuses institute mask mandates yet begging medical help states. simple mask mandate would stop problem tracks. Fortunately, many school districts insisting anyway. certain political rallies us working office since 2020... government officials killing people must face consequences   Okay? adorable. bet it‚Äôs lot fun normal year. vaccine efficacy 79%, even vaccinating 100% people protect 79% exposed.

I think that's true least understanding. Vaccine efficacy tells us many less people expect see infected vs unvaccinated group. two groups thousand people unvaccinated group 100 got infected would expect 21 get infected vaccinated group efficacy 79%. could also mean E, number equation (1-1/R0)/E, could 97.9% assume everyone groups exposed. know typically know many people exposed studies I'm sure measure E. E represents likelihood someone vaccinated ever end getting infected understanding. Yup. Plus PCR tests surprisingly high false negative rate‚Ä¶ 9-30% depending study ‚Äúbetter‚Äù way?

To get rid capitalism completely restructure priorities way life. can't infinite growth finite planet. can't system *requires* endless consumption *creates* demand things nothing. way economy functions what's killing planet. prioritizes profit profit only, antithetical sustainability, even ""greenest"" company still incentivized cut corners get ahead - don't, competition will, know that. Consuming less, doing, goes capitalist economic system. allow degrowth requires constant consumerism stop imploding. try evocative metaphors. plus way cheaper kids messy. So.... boosters.

Should go ahead get them? health greatest already organ transplant chemo... I'm starting feel like time though. \[Early april 2nd moderna shot iirc\]

Kind wish CDC would clear get 3rd shot besides basic blanket label. kind want get ahead curve though, suspect next months need booster shot we'll back driving 3 hours get vaccine again... Vaccination requirement kind unemployment benefit. vaxxed support this.

Note: HIPPAs we‚Äôre violated making statement First: Vaccinations work

But statistic say much fraction vaccinated people equal fraction vaccinated people deaths. simply reflecting population whole. N95 similar masks catch even smaller things, extent, electrical charge.


But organic gas cartridges give better protection (especially combined additional filter). Fucking Tater Tot. Kids died, pediatric hospitals beds, they‚Äôre putting field hospital parking garage &amp; plan use teens. willful ignorance. reporting though? Disney starting back, NCL (which also going 100% vaccination requirement). Carnival (95% vaccination) RCCL reporting numbers per cruise per ship. exactly reporting?

It‚Äôs pretty much impossible contract tracing within community people don‚Äôt believe Covid don‚Äôt think government *exist*, much less making phone calls asking recent activities. Oh yeah, technological progress real source hope point.

In terms transportation, agree efficiency keep increasing. also agree international travel (or least certain type) social good, huge amount I've done really done lot broaden outlook. (And made quite guilty massive lifetime carbon footprint.)

But considering terrifying state planet within next decade two - heck, pretty terrifying - I'm sure type technological progress, own, enough save us worst effects high-carbon, high-consumption lifestyles. So, maybe time geoengineering! medical professionals... Best luck. powers declare immunocompromised! Go get third shot! Well f keep seeing people write, ""Ignore case numbers, thing matters hospitalization rates."" people casually dismiss risk Long Covid. People really want over, decide believe want believe. very, frustrating. swear it‚Äôs like huge portion us totally fine allowing deadly airborne virus roam free.

Feels like virus infected culture even actually infected us. though supernatural force behind results mass delusion, like hexxus ferngully mixed toxoplasmosis. Somehow infecting minds work virus instead actual virus even come contact them.  true hear lot people misinterpret ‚Äúno mask edict‚Äù Shocking.

Not. 

This happens ignore virus. impact COVID greater number verified infections. Last week, interim Superintendent Mike Burke confirmed 440 kids quarantined 45 positive COVID. Using math, 2000 students likely quarantined now. students can‚Äôt go school, access ‚Äúlive‚Äù instruction. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis banned school districts offering virtual, live learning last year. Quarantined students may download school work complete own.

So 2000 kids already quarantined desantis banned online school ‚Äúlearning‚Äù own? didn‚Äôt see Florida could get worse are. Eastern Oregon super rural (read: antimasker/antivax), almost cases last year. getting hit hard dont know do. Man walks woods antler headband hunting season, they've made decision.

We use soft cpr mask (kid size) attach adapter P100 filter. buy create adapter fit mask (without using anything emit toxic gas). correct number correct (and would presume is) would equal 200x365 year neighborhood 75k would insane also use ""Quick Javascript Switcher"" addon want leave Chrome binary bullshit. I'm sure answer yes, eventually, chances extremely unlikely. continuum, likelihoods, whether *can* happen not. chances death hospitalisation get reduced flu levels around world, pandemic considered over. almost annoying 'Vaccinated Person Gets Covid' continuing news headline. political issue, logical issue. can't look logically.

The issue, some, hinges upon ""Civil Liberties"" ""you can't tell do"" approaches. downturn COVID Cases, several groups moved ban mask mandates that, future, people would never subjected forced wear mask. lot measures went through: COVID downturn, political hot button nobody wanted touch, everyone thought ""it matter anyway, COVID way out""

Politicians, now, ""destroy"" political careers going party constituents. sticky issue mask mandates, states, legislated ""illegal"". This, course, mean can't wear mask, means person cannot made wear mask (or mandate wear mask) .

Science logic apply, ideology.

EDIT: I'm getting right wrong. point view, trying answer question disconnected neutral need still wearing masks. Minimum wage Texas 7.25 (absurdly low) means would make around 15-20 thousand year working full time rate.

A quick google search suggests average salary nursing home staff Texas 55-65 thousand. would suggest hourly wage $20/hour 

Regardless, low pay excuse risking people's lives, especially since vaccine free.  So, 40-50 hours exposer resulted 243 people (including staff) get covid. imagine see week 4-6?  area since healthcare one stable, decent paying jobs around. many nurses help people like job. 

It's sort like army. everybody die hard patriots. Lots anything else do.  Nurses much different. ‚ÄúCite‚Äù no?

It‚Äôs citation, sitation‚Ä¶ really clarifying looking photo linked article thinking ""I know Delta transmissable, mostly sounds like outdoor activity seen anything yet contranidicates understanding outdoor transmission rare, even Delta.""

That may prove terrible decision part  look contributing problem...kids NEED. many people kids financially emotionally prepared deal &amp; harmful child, also harmful planet. would never rude mean verbally shame someone kids blue, someone ask opinion, heck yes I'd tell selfish child, that's truth. Herd immunity infection vs vaccination? C‚Äômon couple tens thousands die process. /s That's nice thing u/DatMoFugga's advice though, simply walk declare ""immunocompromised"" status, place give booster, mention benefit amending original vaccination paperwork rather getting second card.

That'll first approach try now... Yes. Young people rightfully resentful forced work starvation wages support generation left us penniless facing climate apocalypse. bad enough left us scorched earth, also obstructing efforts right ship. 

Fuck that. want one makes smarter, stronger, live longer slightly evil. evil, enough interesting. keep reading ""llama nobodies"", like llama celebrities able help middle-lower-class llamas heroes end pandemic. Fuck 'em counting JJ vaccine 1 dose instead fully vaccinated? That's one problems numbers Netherlands, track jabs arms many person needs.  Eh, Sputnik‚Äôs first shot pretty much J&amp;J small differences second shot different virus different adjuvant (supposedly) also works extremely well. It‚Äôs really hard say reason AZ + Pfizer works well mechanism difference. Hell, doesn‚Äôt even make sense me: virus mRNA *exact thing* (hijacking cells produce antigens) essence, switching suspension media either way.

I agree regardless, getting booster anything increase protection J&amp;J. unsure strength even close strength AZ + Pfizer.  Everyone sing song one time get straight.

On hand vaccinated, immune system goes ""Oh crap, invaders. what?"" spends week trying figure what's going on. immune system figure what's going on, there's chance overreacts *that's* lands hospital and/or gives long COVID.

If vaccine 90% effective, said 97.1% efficacy represents 250% improvement. 90% effective=10 fold decrease incidence infections, 250% improvement could mean 3.5 fold additional mprovement, 35x decrease infections.

I'm fucking ruined. Literally one thought verify cards! Wtf alone question, question definitely one implementing policy NY considered.

What you, kind Einstein? Yeah totally agree. bought bunch regional news broadcasters bit scary.  horrible reaction second shot. like body attacking violently. would still get third booster. that's body reacted got vaccine, desire ever contract covid. ‚Ä¶Where‚Äôs rum gone? That's bad. have, checks calendar, two weeks left August. understand, mask mandatory outside bubble schools. Opt Tennessee.  Pretty pathetic require test. Fact: vaccinated folks still contract virus spread it, like natural immunities. already natural immunity safe. 
The vaccine stop spread period! helps decide get it, adverse side effects. still proven. know 2 got shot husband wife. ICU. One oxygen make passed. know lot people rightfully hesitant get vaxxed, always told info came would least consider getting it. eventually got it. People like this, LEGIT questions it, respect. people say stuff like ""I NEVER get vaccine"" stuff like that, bother trying convince them, reasoning behind likely political defiance. agree. merely stating concerns heard side. think psychological concerns widespread harmful chemicals angle. enough experience choking never want feeling again. caused get test? fatigue requirement? know couple friends get tested work tested positive - said looking back bit tired never put two together test.  northernmost Caribbean city. US, boosters recommended small percentage population, people received solid organ transplants. done like motorcycle classes. get equally cheesy card, one kind reference number it. dmv check legit mine.  CDC relied data previous outbreaks, including SARS-1. initially recommend masks displaying symptoms healthcare workers.

Do really think health agencies changing health guidelines based something else? would argue making health recommendations backed evidence construes bigger problem long run. cops like. 'You're sucka' think fair force turn customers. go far vaccine. could walk pizzeria yesterday, need show papers?  Virtually everyone going catch covid point. Full stop. you‚Äôre vaccinated, likely nothing bad cold. people die needlessly, sucks, happens million aspects life well.

Everyone US given tool protect themselves, given near future. Get vaccinated. Get boosters if/when they‚Äôre available. Take basic reasonable precautions like staying home sick avoiding people sick, like people already did.

But it‚Äôs simply worth losing time average person. general, post-vaccine world, would rather risk covid give precious time life. Covid could kill make miserable; worrying avoiding forever absolutely make miserable I‚Äôll die eventually anyway. people need make different calculus, sucks too.

No, vaccine required law today. Technically could simply show receive shot. one tracking right now. last years, people also tried spread anti-vaccination propaganda well.

Here Brazil, everyone 50 younger got vaccinated couple diseases kid, part life. People uncertain simply decided better receive vaccine saw well worked elsewhere.

People spreading antivaxxer propaganda simply bet wrong horse, works really well given vaccines common one paying attention months although make lot noise last year.

Also, campaign targeting adults only. total number people targeted receive vaccine close 9 million people population 12 million. raw numbers, close 73% total population getting least one dose. Maybe include teenagers children later since countries already data them. I‚Äôm talking way back beginning country

They could done tariffs prior 1913 since collect income taxes otherwise.  like nine something could say wrong might gotten right dosage age group. 11-year-old that's less two months 12? That's picky. Nothing see here.  Hey remember hated Hillary Clinton?

AZ J&amp;J similar vaccines would shocked turned different boosting mRNA. probably notice third dose.  Damn must hard, keep up! yeah, get remote work things get ugly (like now) I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre dealing that. get Covid vaccinated? worry much. It‚Äôs hard concentrate work life sitting back thoughts. annoying going stop annoying.

When necessary protect responsible people Covid, it. small price pay that, price.

However, vaccine freely available anyone walks pharmacy months, Covid gone. problem solved, isn't, bunch worthless idiots refused get vaccine. virus rids world enough anti-vaccers start getting back normal again, put annoying precautions knows many months entirely peoples' stupidity. 

I'll keep wearing mask required recommended, fucking happy it. isnt least threatening cut administration's pay, he'd punishing people responsible mask mandates (which would still horrible).

He's cutting pay people nothing decision. Holding teachers hostage force compliance administration. Absolutely disgusting, Bond villain type behavior. Imagine variation 10000 times lethal....Im guessing situation people would quick follow protocols everyone want follow today. ... CDC authorize vaccines. FDA Agree. Ed Yong incredible kids zoned KISD (also Harris County) superintendent basically bent licked wheels Abbott‚Äôs chair. We‚Äôre lucky agreed optional virtual learning October. No, get wrong, agree 100%.
I actually talking people mention, ones sitting job, dont need project voice class move around such.  Texan here. First immigration...I questions mind. someone moved Mexico financial state Mexico occupation? male female? occupation significant others here? What's financial state here? cross international border? long much cost get citizenship. yoy learn english? trying rude questions. I'm construction worker. I've worked completely illegally, visas greencards...I honestly know difference...and working citizenship. I'll admit believe others entering US illegally halted. also hand blame leaving corrupt poor nation another, also corrupt opportunities basically better standard living. many residents Port Arthur come southern border. neighbors. take offense stance. don't. least outwardly. clear I'm immigration. thoughts? someone chiming I'm racist bigot...‚úå  Many done illegally. 

I might loop this, it‚Äôs clear illegal not. illegal, would illegal way jaywalking illegal, i.e. real enforcement it‚Äôs sometimes better crossing busy intersection correct way Good get alone office. I‚Äôm tossed meat grinder everyday. see 120 teenagers every day. wish luxury solitary office could sit quietly mask. Either he/she parent poor one. wear seat belt then? would driving drink problem? whatever want? Smoke restaurant. Shit street?

This lunacy. Everybody eventually catch Covid like everyone occasionally gets cold, fortunately vaccine normally makes comparable severity. really need get rid social stigma catching Covid, can‚Äôt seen ‚Äútaboo‚Äù forever.  Ducks smarter socially responsible unvaccinated.  It‚Äôs difficult you‚Äôre physical job (teaching physical) talking LOT 8 hours. It‚Äôs one thing sit desk mask, it‚Äôs another ball game actively teach one. 

Look, sucks. still it. wear mask everywhere. I‚Äôm vaccinated. don‚Äôt go eat. don‚Äôt go bars. skipped every holiday. part. still acknowledge teaching mask 8-9 hours without break hard. pick state (I‚Äôm TX) I‚Äôve eyes quiet little New Mexico. Politics, weather, COL don‚Äôt swing far comfort zone. They‚Äôve decent covid response vaccine uptake. Also, border state: good Mexican food. Northern Virginia happy her. realize natural immunity good better vaccine right? Y‚Äôalliban Copium. 

A lot people hard time dealing uncertainty, especially uncertainty hinges life death events. like 85-90% people fully vaccinated, hospitalizations deaths would probably follow. \~50%. many people left vulnerable hospitals cope. said ‚Äúassuming two month safety data raise new safety concerns‚Ä¶‚Äù That‚Äôs big assumption. Speaking one folks late 20‚Äôs, wouldn‚Äôt say I‚Äôm ‚Äúterrified‚Äù, also don‚Äôt need risk long term effects COVID lungs brain. livelihood basically hobbies dependent two things. hanging fully vaxxed friends though.  kids go home school? ... I'm confused people complaining wearing piece cloth faces making massive deal it.
Like, second week wearing back January 2020 got used it, much forget take sometimes alone office.  *dead ducks POS major put parties lives risk. knew Florida bad damn‚Ä¶. antivax area white, wealthy, conservative. pharma companies trials atm see best course action boosters (just thing first 2 vs. modifying compensate new variants). go get 3rd shot now, it'll exact first 2 since that's that's currently available/approved. Treat vaccinated adults, medically fragile couldn‚Äôt vaccinated, children. Let willfully obtuse unvaccinated adults fend themselves. High enough wouldn‚Äôt chance it. Limit crowd size exposure can. would 100% wrong, example AZ vaccine stated GoC website coming US&amp;India

Moderna vaccines came well aware Moderna plant completed years.

Etc.  people Mississippi, it‚Äôs time recall Governor. 

If thinks he‚Äôs going win re-election, HAPPENING. trials still blinded still ongoing. say passed safety trials? people sub probably: ""This fearmongering!"" Authoritarian systems often good throwing huge amount resources big problems. tend bad addressing small issues become big. Yes, unfortunately take many months face result importation vaccines, again, unfortunately, knowing corruption IRI mean adulteration, fraud, etc. vaccines stolen sold black/grey market.

As type, happening right now. Pfizer vaccine sought costs around ~$1,500 USD Iran exorbitantly high given avg income Yeah stuck around entire year put resignation March. couldn‚Äôt deal another year it, frankly could endless years people continue idiots variants continue pop up. worth I‚Äôm financially well enough much lower stress work.

Not really surprising see healthcare worker shortages, can‚Äôt abuse healthcare workers expect us continue putting it. It‚Äôs size. It‚Äôs immune system changes children grow older. early portion pediatric trials studied different doses see use larger trials age group. It‚Äôs like flipping switch immune system needs different doses age cohort changes make cutoffs somewhere.  total sympathy, friend‚Ä¶poison ivy worst. actually get cortisone shot taking pills pills didn‚Äôt knock out. Used job hazard me. Throw away gloves clothes wearing afford to. kept getting realized toxic oil gear doesn‚Äôt wash normal detergent. think three cortisone shots 6 month period. Hope luck pills. Scratch scratch scratch. two think oxygen poison...

I understand admire driving persist nevertheless.  Thank you!!! US fine job vaccines logistics. Anyone wanted vaccine could gotten one months ago. problem ton people refuse take them. Vaccine uptake hasn‚Äôt logistical issue US months. 100% people wanted vaccinated could done months ago. live Texas hate true is. I'm hoping history remember kindly, told 5 years ago politician begging help virus despite scientific solution bans preventing he'd wrong, would've looked like crazy, yet are. lollapalooza football wont guys basically almost think invulnerable. never see doctor even sick, now.  actively root people now.  entire World dying left right 2020, vaccines.   are. They‚Äôre sterilizing immunity.  OSHA federal level cover public employees.  state programs states OSHA-approved persons, Texas program.  Don‚Äôt nervous! sounds like ‚Äústandard‚Äù human body problems. person describing reaction seems pretty serious illness. 

A good friend mine also terrible allergies- he‚Äôs allergy shots, oral antihistamines, nasal sprays. gets sinus infections couple times year least. sick second vaccine dose (Pfizer) day.

beep boop, I'm bot -|:] bot's opinion banned karma manipulation. feel bad, probably bot too.

Confused? Read info work exist. Would look - mediocre pop punk band 30 years ago smarter Republican American government. Good boys.  reminds source data backs up, would good see countries see patterns.  shocked North Carolina ranks 7th. Honestly kind depressing. science teacher speak solar panels thought would steal light surrounding areas fucks sake 
Free Republic? Yeah, they've around long time wrong side every major issue history. Calling sketchy generous. Why's everyone disbelief, hard get CT scan? got one recently sinuses. referral I'll take seriously...
1. desperate schools going consider hiring people without teaching experience. bottom pile deal lot red tape.

2. Better pay (assuming Master's), considerably better. teach MA, even school gives $7000/year first year teacher possessing Masters. teaching 10 years, person advanced degrees makes $10k/year someone Bachelor.

3. freaking hard job, teaching degree give tools make through

4. help network pool experts ask help from.

5. wanting teacher, value education education's sake. 

6. Massachusetts really dang expensive. states, think, experiencing teacher shortage, may even need move. hell‚Ä¶
just why!? got first dose (pfizer) couple days ago, wating till 30th 2nd.

Its good bad lot side effects first dose? fair, lot people thought vaccinated meant would infected, therefore would contagious. got first shot (moderna) hit like semi truck next day. 101 fever, body aches coughing colors, second day almost gone. Today I‚Äôm normal, I‚Äôm really impressed w much hit me. science 101, correlation causation, lot things happened 2019 vs 2020.... Like global pandemic. website sketchy. citations? Graphs? Where's article actually from? even written English can't read it. That's proper research done.

This recent publication:

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*   fair, sky news isn‚Äôt exactly staple news outlet people.  isn‚Äôt travel nurses vs regular staff nurses. 

It‚Äôs **all nurses** vs **hospital administrators**. 

Administrators sole reason nursing shortage. They‚Äôve always run skeleton crews worked us bare-bones, it‚Äôs 1000x intensified covid. paid staff (even temporarily) amount pay travel nurses, they‚Äôd retain lot nurses. 

Travel nurses make bank year round. rates COVID only. don‚Äôt receive benefits either like 401k. Contracts 8-13 weeks long, hospitals cancel TIME soon don‚Äôt need nurses (aka soon run skeleton possible). 

I‚Äôm glad travel nurses making bank. deserve shit nurses put with. high-risk job. Going worst affected hospitals. Hospitals need pay staff rate though.  No, can't debunk bunch numbers without source, without additional data, without clear explanation researchers.

Find new friends. one's broken. POS.. wants keep idiot parents happy would elect so.. sanctify life safety kids. low life It‚Äôs pretty curious choose Jan-May (and 2019 2020?) frame reference. 

Unless there‚Äôs logic conditions happening Jan-May really looks like cherry picking data. mention additional years get stdev see 2021 statistically significant outlier year.

My guess don‚Äôt want include May-Dec 2020 disregard conditions arising due covid. uncle went doctor annual cardiologist appointment. looking chart doctor saw COVID may. Asked hasn‚Äôt got vaccine called dummy face. Doctors need start more. teach definitely find hard think I'm masked. don''t think could drive saftely one either. may glasses fog issues sensory issues adhd (normally can't wear jewelery clothes irritating fabrics without distracting me) Ah....I love smell entitled fucks morning. didn‚Äôt ‚Äúunleash it‚Äù. Comparison thief joy. Focus family, obviously easier said done. dont know helps, wishing best. hope everyone sees this. southern surge 2020 summer. fall surge north starting mid late September. full social distancing masks north 2020.

So right now, 2021 summer south. Vax rates high enough anywhere. Guess gonna happen months north? 

Be prepared. know. read reports this. know. It‚Äôs good leadership, it‚Äôs awful people won‚Äôt listen.

We really need politicians right balls tell people get vaccinated, stop wishy washy make clear non-political statement.

Only Ivy done thing understanding. got second shot month ago day, pfizer, i‚Äôve apparently caught stomach bug/flu, so‚Ä¶ might unlucky lol, that‚Äôs life Clearly never NJ Transit trains 5-9 a.m. already seeing therapist/counselor, would definitely encourage so. soon seeking help address mental health overall wellbeing. shame admitting need help. actually proud making healthy decision.

Hang there, still parts life world beautiful. &lt;3 Dr. Gottlieb thinks last big wave next couple weeks Covid rates start going down. agree him? Why? Abbott‚Äôs crusade curb Covid-related regulations comes ahead re-election campaign next year, face primary challengers lambasted earlier safety measures. It‚Äôs one many signs noticeable shift right conservative governor, wooing Texas‚Äôs primary voters political lightning rods red meat conservatism. put way, nervous breakdown February seems lot understandable  stop shocked happened we‚Äôve collectively acted like it‚Äôs ‚Äògone back normal‚Äô cases? Look around last wave‚Ä¶you think even half people without masks vaccinated? likely. It‚Äôs less Delta variant society quit acting like existed tired masks wanted eat out, go concerts birthday parties again.  Travel nurses aren‚Äôt meant long-term solution. They‚Äôre supposed fill gaps permanent staff hired. receive benefits 401k short 13-week contracts, hospital cancel contract time (WHICH soon find cheaper staff). 

Also- high rates nurses working directly covid patients (ICU, ED, COVID units). risking health lives pay. like oil rig guys get paid well deep sea fisherman high risk job. 

That said‚Äî hospitals need pay staff hazard rates working covid ICU ED. like travelers, pay temporary high rates get onslaught ‚Äî improve morale ‚Äî immediately see nurses stop leaving go travel get burned fucking peanuts. 

This 100% administration management problem. Hospital administrators SUCK ASS cheap. employ skeleton crews making small wages make fucking bonuses end year. NEVER see hospital administrator helping patients. Talking families. Refilling water, ice, linens, even giving patient warm blanket. 

Administrators sit offices comfort homes, cutting staff working nurses they‚Äôre burned ‚Äî acting like care patients families thing care fucking bonuses. 

Administrators brought nursing shortage THEMSELVES. already wearing us covid it‚Äôs 1000x worse. There‚Äôs much fucking handle. vaccinated everyone state opportunity get vaccinated. half state chosen get shot. really uneducated people around here. 

His kids go private school Jackson area. school requiring masks. Nah don‚Äôt care anymore even hospitals completely full. üòÜüòÜ impressive impossible haha. never really actual antivax sentiment here. Basically protests masks, health measures vaccines like places US EU.

My city started making appointments 18~22 age group 5 days ago already 81.5% adult population vaccinated. also events like come take shot, there's tons people still waiting. friends early 20's going get shots first week September vaccination places still completely booked previous age groups.  daughter turned 1 two weeks ago, she‚Äôs starting daycare November. mobility making working home almost impossible. mom helps us lot, health issues can‚Äôt care 8 hours day, 5 days week indefinitely. hate situation, hate hope things would better, it‚Äôs gone moment.  Many probably don‚Äôt kids, kids go private school masks mandated. It‚Äôs absolutely political. Pfizer vaccine sought 

Do know particular one? Well guess using hieroglyphics next variants rate come 2022ü§î right! functionally miserable still functional. deliriously day dreaming I'm giant bounce castle voice God speaking ü§£  I‚Äôm rural part south Louisiana local hospital released statement begging people get vaccine wear masks. 

The next day principal local high school released video YouTube asking same. 

I still see people ranting freedom masks jabs. Meanwhile currently know 5 people icu covid here. 

They won‚Äôt wise till hits circle god that‚Äôs coming surge. Please click link. image nothing article. Cause governor s√£o paulo state kinda went war bolsonaro started buy vaccines trying build vaccine factories. That's political propaganda, vaccinate everyone become hero future run president (probably try 2022). Rio de janeiro also vaccinated 100k people last saturday.

In total, Brazil 75% adults least first shot, 31% second. 


And side note, bolsonaro suffering huge pressure, lot investigations handled pandemic starting lead possible impeachment, people also tired bullshit says. new thing blaming quarentine shitty economy, even tho brazil never actually stopped, like 20 days lockdown 2020 quickly things started reopen smart headline use country massive vaccine hesitancy? Let's find out. can't help keep thinking got deserved. probably mean. Sorry. There's 2 types people world: extrapolate incomplete data. Copy link paste here: www.outline.com Darwinism best? I've got zero compassion people refuse get vaccinated without good cause get sick point time. 

People refusing vaccine: largely problem pandemic raging right now!! might heard long term consequences death. Besides 1% US population 3,310,000 people. 1% still lot millions cases worldwide. think that'd work Australia. I've seen many Australian sky clips spread around Netherlands, people maniacs, they're gonna succesfully sow enough doubt upwards 30% get it.

But never mandated everyone vaccinate, Chinese people usually believe vaccines. Consider this: pandemic, less 1% Chinese chose get flu vaccine , even though hundreds millions Chinese caught flu year.  see!

Maybe know truly don‚Äôt care. idea means. friend Florida friday said first shot. chain stores checking database, they've got better things upset they're throwing vaccines anyway.

But guy did, booster possible, better data tracking say booster. 

CDC estimates 1 million+ already lied booster last week. done much without crazy surveillance system China since pandemic.

The ""crazy"" surveillance system shit pandemic. difference China institution bottom level, countries not. example, people work right building, come back Hubei last spring, stopped first floor building , 4:00am. asked fill questionaire 100 questions disclose whereabouts last 100 days, promised call everyday next two weeks. 

&amp;#x200B;

It's kind down-to-last-mile personel network made CCP omni-potent. so-called ""crazy"" surveillance system actually much shit, useful maybe cases break-in robbery(which many). enter state's records notice got two already? would great, least informative, could add numbers previously infected vaccinated (but previously infected) show actual number people country reasonable immunity. required proof vaccination. Many highschools fighting kids even wear masks.  son turns 12 January. I‚Äôm tempted. isn‚Äôt anything magical that‚Äôs going make safer then. I‚Äôll even pay bc know insurance throw fit. Feign stupidity Gilead Sciences Remdesivir windfall. stock breaks $72 Rand Paul pay bills. first time mom young child RIGHT sh1t hit, yes. alcoholic? No, certainly drink used to.... working liquor store since 2019. sales soaring demographics. EVERYONE drinking more. small number slowed quit result. 2020 best year store ever dramatic margins.

Turns tell folks stay home due pandemic throw social political unrest, folks want drink....... Vaccination mandates  Since governments job nanny population? 

Google term government means. mostly fatetious, haha. He'll last group obviously pass 5. it. worth it. curiosity, still testing positive? see harm spending $20 home rapid tests test assuage anxiety, even technically scientifically necessary. still die wear seatbelt, cars crash. mean fine let kids ride front without one. Thanks response! known resource existed, really interesting see.

fwiw, makes total sense kids would infected group, idea posted this, appreciate link Trump took it.    Well there's extensive campaigning vaccinate even low education past decades. Pop vaccination clinics vaccinate children, even vaccine mascot kids scared. lot work normalize become ""the culture"" problem mainly insane job commitments savings universal income fall back on. that, yeah there's deadly pandemic going around, family first. one risking health keep schools daycares going. 100% yes. it‚Äôs wrong dumb, count MS it. definitely re-elected need wearing masks outside also, people around. Since delta came scene, people getting infected barbecues, parks, city streets. really highly contagious.

Luckily keep fairly safe vaccine. easily pick infect someone else, including unvaccinated children, even aware breakthrough infection. tricky aspect hard CDC/Public Health deal with. rethink everything, try get new message across. people confusion. People difficulty last year understanding need quarantine symptoms ... showing cannot grasp complexities delta, increased airborn contagion, vaccines immunity. Anybody shred hope future? Early 30‚Äôs, fully vaxxed, mild moderate asthma. 

I got sick early July small 4th july gathering vaccinated friends. Sore throat / runny nose turned dry wet cough. Tested negative covid. Still recovering it. Turned dr believes sinus infection Ended go back preventative asthma medicine hadnt taken like 6 years try get rid last bit sickness. 

People forgot like even regular cold me, wife back masks public, handful vaccinated friends come we‚Äôre eating restaurants anymore (take only). 

If get covid, probably fine. Beyond asthma im pretty healthy, risk we‚Äôre willing take friends higher risk tolerances us. 

It‚Äôs hard stand firm many acting less cautious, makes us comfortable. YES.

 anyone really familiar China's system knew, local government usually stupid slow, tend hide bad stuff carpet save ass; something decided top , process thorough swift dwarfs every obstacle path.

It good thing bad thing(bad thing tragedy great culture revolution), really effective stuff force 1.4 billion line mask mandates, social distancing, put everybody staying houses super-megacity.

Y‚Äôall need bum gun Fortunately, withdrawing child school simple enough Texas, whatever need order keep children safe state's government (and idiots seem surrounded by) shits many others.  know. scary future country. school district rule 14 day quarantine classmate covid. Everyone masit. Though point I'm sure worth following strict guideline. I'm sure others good opinions jt. count, bro! while. They‚Äôre stupid enough open risk health citizens fuck economy international tourists. can't find anything wrong. would take lots money fund kind research (like research, would guarantee ever finding anything useful) we've never done it.

The sort post-viral syndromes seen basically every viral infection, roughly proportion severity. COVID far top end viral severity diseases measurable number people allowed meet, we're seeing lot here. Mond gov. Kids go prive school masks mandatory hasnt moved OSHA apply teachers Texas complicated concept. Vaccines work. hope :( Well done Singapore! Also, loyal base idea actually happening.  epistemically closed set information sources Facebook, Fox News, OANN. Covid still hoax world. 

Poor black Latino people still dying higher rates. political price pay this, simply reason care. 

All people pulling strings keep going vaccinated way. gotten funding though? Last I‚Äôd heard, local districts received federal COVID money. state withholding it. Sure looks like government serving people... like... government removed? Yep. need look this. already know kids elementary school say ok well excused absences. It‚Äôs largest employer state. Disney World helped make Florida is.  They‚Äôre pro-life never been. entire movement fraud. seems like Federal government could step occupational safety perspective take action require masks OSHA mandate. Teachers require safe working environment. remember happened last year too. 24/24 covid coverage, nothing George Floyd murder, gradually shifted back covid. article Harris County, talking HISD, starts 8/23. didn‚Äôt know DFW already started. guess y‚Äôall see outbreak then. Back checking stats every day. Holy beans getting old. Well good news Florida hospitalizations went first time 2 weeks probably blip it‚Äôs something. Absolutely! think everything, there's balance. I'm certainly way vaccinated, I'm steering clear large indoor crowds part, I'm inside building, I'm wearing mask. see hardship take basic precautionary steps protect others also living life outside four walls house. best cell responses (without infection) gotten via vectored vaccine prime followed mRNA 12 weeks. course trialed everything; one specifically done feel that. Without giving much information why, take emergency last minute trip Omaha, Nebraska 3 days ago absolutely hated it. husband took masks took cooler sandwich making supplies, drinks snacks us. absolutely want stop anything gas. stay hotel took Lysol wipes spray scrubbed wiped everything down. took sheets pillows. 

I saw one wearing masks Kansas Turnpike pumps gas stop, saw one wearing masks hotel. 

All could keep wearing mask, keep away people keep sanitizing practices. works not, good enough overkill, dont care, makes feel better. struggle bit understand nervousness. Agreed. Kids vector high risk themselves. kids risk though. Risk mediation ventilation masking ideal. children vector risk unvaccinated. group little public health value anymore cost protect outweighs benefits.

The biggest risk people can't go hospital full unvaccinated masses. 

We friends whose mom passed going cancer checkups due covid. cancer came back suddenly. covid definitely affected it. Save us llamas!!! **Yes.**   I've dozens overnight stays hospital last two decades. (Almost two years since last, though!) horror stories *just top head.*

Why think case? would doctors tell people can't find anything wrong? 3 months past 2nd dose, I'd tempted. Maybe come October November I'll give try Texas Supreme Court throws civil penalties local authorities brings contempt charged. possible local official stage civil disobedience action test court's response, see anything changing result. 

In terms Texas law, fairly clear-cut issue. State authority supersedes local authority. ways pro-mask position move forward get Texas legislature overrule governor, get case federal court. Neither option looks promising right now.

I‚Äôd love see google-fu trying refute vaccines work even better together. Obama's fault like math that's close science them. politics, worse pivot ""move goal posts"" demonstrable wrong knowingly lie it.

Unfortunately, ""evolving science,"" good thing science world, synonymous ""moving goal posts"" politics. unvaxxed preexisting condition medically conservative? USA sordid history subjugation race, downstream effects populations certain races born worse living conditions ruling class counterparts think understand thousands stayed already died. delta. they're risking lives save lives idiots get free vaccine, world favors. Millions POG members think Fauci boogeyman. Right okay, that's probably saw earlier. need wait Canada catch :( 74 million people voted Trump shitshow covid response. So, answer question: nothing. Nothing sway conservatives side reality. say laughable threaten school board members' pay, apparently Florida actually pays school board members relatively substantial salary. state, serving school board considered job pay thousand affluent districts. Ehh comment sort implied haven‚Äôt honest. Wouldn‚Äôt hang unmasked INDOOR bars restaurants sure!

Outside? long super packed space (I keep small distance) especially proof vaccination required - yes - I‚Äôd unless things drastically change vaccinated. 

If they‚Äôre masked airports, vaccinated, masked plane - that‚Äôs reasonable - going life much still taking precautions.

They shouldn‚Äôt think pandemic whatever want - comfortable steps taking also personally interact small kids indoors without masks. Maybe even outdoors luckily rarely see children.

Don‚Äôt see us much disagreement unless think shouldn‚Äôt see friends relatively low risk environments balance public safety prioritizing mental health. Maybe funding remote learning won‚Äôt bad school year. get swiss cheese is, I'm bit confused stand masks, vaccines, tabs ability eliminate covid lives. think started saying things could end pandemic, ie, common sense thing like wear masks? Sorry forums great communication, well. article totally wrong. forgot include mass consumption chips, chocolate cookies. need edit piece.   
Speaking of‚Ä¶ chips cookie, please What's dangerous, giving vaccine making stay unvaxxed delta surge? would bet pretty strongly former safer option. covid deaths voter suppression, person voting next year? I'm okay missing collection. Canada 100% vaccines came Europe , India US haven‚Äôt manufactured single vaccine . Moderna partnership set last week factory take 2 years produce first made Canada vaccine imagine, too, stayed onboard sting quite bit seeing new nurses offered $10k/week... fuck feel insultingly undervalued new hires likely offered 4-10x much pay?

The option quit get better pay elsewhere would look super attractive, gonna quit go somewhere anyway might well find somewhere bit less shitty, stay field all. meant sense seem long way figuring whatever implying Definitely. 

The article's point might decent one, kind point one needs making right Covid ravaging southern US.

It's point conservative father parrots whenever try tell 20% positivity rating county 100/100k new cases day bad.

No symptoms week later. Masks vaccines work. happened mind? click link comments, scroll talks article. 


What immunocompromised people received J&amp;J/Janssen vaccine do?

The FDA‚Äôs recent EUA amendment applies mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, CDC‚Äôs recommendation.

Emerging data demonstrated immunocompromised people low protection following two doses mRNA COVID-19 vaccines may improved response additional dose vaccine. enough data time determine whether immunocompromised people received Johnson &amp; Johnson‚Äôs Janssen COVID-19 vaccine also improved antibody response following additional dose vaccine. Patrick Star right...Texas DUMB.

My fear exactly seen thread. Though live NJ vaccinations rates high around here, still fear son. parents still send kids school sick. I'm already fearing tell someone son's class exposed COVID quarantine. Next month likely peak outbreak. would go.  Carlin damned underrated. philosopher happened funny. they're pro-birth, kid's born give shit actively start everything screw kid up. Yes, that‚Äôs point. people think anything remotely similar happen parts country higher vax rates? Cases go up, that‚Äôs point vaccine. point reduce hospitalizations death clearly that. sounds like almost back square 2.. Except variants virulent may less asymptomatic cases therefore less folks spreading treated. need worry cost living living. truly can‚Äôt understand people think reason avoid getting illness you‚Äôre likely die it. Covid, even ‚Äúmild‚Äù cases, sounds terrible don‚Äôt want catch it, want spread anyone else. read man killed developed severe tinnitus due long covid.

But time, reasons, one fit people elect admire someone like Ron Desantis. 


Seeing many people wanting move Florida specifically \*because\* Desantis ""freedom masks!"" stance.  Let's trade. Florida gets red, someplace else gets blue. moving anywhere else South, that's sure. Well said. good reason FDA give full approval instead EUA get started mandates.  Ohhhh Mississippi unanimously worst state Yeah Indonesia Chile found delta around latter half June, idk population densities whatever factors effect Indonesia way harder time Chile.

Also fair, started talking boosters currently already starting, countries using coronavac, bad press haunts every report since.  Insurers get approval rates state DOIs would simply deny obviously illegal practice. Even lawsuit court would take side simple black white law prohibits rate discrimination based anything besides age, location smoking. supreme court ACA would garbage insurers could discriminate pre-existing conditions, occupation whatever else.

That much true all. help preventing infection, prevent infectiousness well. Viral load sole indicator infectiousness. I'll take guess....most passengers infected. Link preprint? AZ risky option

This always terrible medical advice. Look deaths NSW right now, WAY deaths AZ. thirty years olds ICU, two died.

This get said enough. Misrepresenting information works ways. Pull her. Find online resources - Kahn Academy maybe - let self-learn. Give projects, assignments, pull together multiple interests.

I also hope antiviral treatments serve tool long covid, see covid much like strep throat long run. mild moderate illness nonetheless requires early aggressive treatment pharmaceuticals prevent long term complications. vaccinated unlikely die end hospital, that's true. likely get infected right ever been. many vaccinated people get cold flu like symptoms virus, I'd rather risk right now.

Once permafrost started thaw, back late 90's really sealed deal, permafrost thaws releases massive amounts CO2, Methane, nitrous oxide, causes warming, triggering thawing, called positive feedback loop, positive feedback loops stop exhaust energy driving loop, case energy greenhouse gases trapped frozen permafrost, twice currently atmosphere. 

At rate permafrost thawing 20 years outputting greenhouse gases humans output now, means could magically snap fingers eliminate human greenhouse gases, 20 years thawing permafrost exceed output now.  granted wish way we'll able reduce greenhouse gas output, 20 years humans thawing permafrost output greenhouse gases **DOUBLE.**  

I actually think humans well get far. oceans becoming warmer acidity, human runoff, plus addition freshwater coming oceans melting ice. 

This really bad phytoplankton populations. Phytoplankton responsible 50-85% oxygen atmosphere, much important rain forests.  oceans warm become acidity phytoplankton populations declining, like population decline tipping point population crashes almost nothing.  happens entire marine ecosystem collapse, phytoplankton basis entire marine food chain.  40% worlds population relies ocean primary source protein. 

Along collapse marine food chain, oxygen production phytoplankton also crash. Currently percentage oxygen atmosphere 20.8 21, lowest percentage oxygen humans need function normally 19.5, phytoplankton population crashes oxygen concentration atmosphere drop significantly.  can't function well low percentages oxygen. foresee many people getting indicted using fake cards.

I mean, also tens millions healthy Americans would considered risk well. would say person decided whether get vaccine based age, weight, overall health, health care providers recommendation. choose get vaccine: great. choose get vaccine: great.

that article says beta even resistant vaccine delta was, number participants 400,000 vaccinated people (8,000 breakthrough infections). 

it's also factually wrong say kids protection own. blanket statement assumes 100% kids 0% chance bodies fighting delta. always always people immune particular virus, strain, variant. 

just chill narrative read actual articles actual scientists get better handle separating fictional factual way justice even remotely begin man walk office handcuffs.

Right pediatric hospitals area (very large metro) capacity. HoSpitalized COVID cases already doubled tripled schools starting back. worrisome me. healthy getting tested regularly still mulling getting vaccine.

A fucking tough read. much preventable death. reported old regular lack unhealthiness. often reported decrease abilities regularly used to.

So yes maybe unhealthy people suffer long covid, that's lot Americans put risk it. lot people America unhealthy. could also make argument unhealthy affects ability survive come diseases well. describing unhealthy bad. saying long covid affect large part population shown so.

These young people I'm sure media thing. I've seen plenty official local federal demographical statistics almost always breakdown race. Even scientific papers vaccine trials (for example). I'm black, personally would really feel offended headline like were. article literally implies people darker skin tend drink more. harmful thing say? moved Alabama college guess we'll see happens... correct incorrect depending hospital crisis mode not. Usually see kind action taken supplies running beds unavailable. Usually see triage tents go first, full start see rationing care supplies. needs unable met rationing starts, that's start see people turned away. usually start see bodies streets speak. turn away anyone feel can't save high chance survival may need specialized care try handle home. also start see lot people dying home parking lots triage tents are. nasty stuff.

I took classes person training crisis care triage care along working facilities would get overflow hospital across street. Basically anyone ICU need specific care required doctor hand, mostly either people needed rehab people death bed; children though thankfully. One women instructed later worked head nurse, triage nurse worked military took care soldiers coming back front lines. pretty gory intense part life would heart beat. learned lot time, lot death also helped lot people recover. learn really fast able survive environment like can't; people well extended crisis situations. girls worked really hard time see kind thing cause collapse Healthcare system force one kinds situations. hope kind thing become common place far deaths already seeing. schools cannot mandate masks middle pandemic mandate dress codes forbid drugs forbid weapons?

Can go school naked piss front everyone? limit freedoms?

Is different logic every decision? Wow uplifting comment. might well completely give hope then, yeah? nooooooo cruise stocks aware US' history, enforces segregation people literally reduced skin color, something everyone simply born with. Right, that's like delay like wanted delay reason right? admit giving benefit doubt, asking data seems like careful. Something relevant sub: vaccine uptake often broken race. Why? socio-economic position geographical area? attributes tied genetic profile. 

I kind understand want track customer race, prove discriminating, really think extremely backwards. Tracking customer race strictly illegal, GDPR required collect information necessary providing service. Customer race definitely part that. must meant 2% 0.02% right? feels good use passport! ate ice cream Emporio La Rosa days ago. ate *in* restaurant instead getting chilly outside. Yay! many infected illegals sneaking across border Florida, would guess? Like every report covid wtf happening. hard see people question things. That‚Äôs anti-vaxxers don‚Äôt understand. 

Once virus enters lungs, destroys lung cells leaving scars empty holes. lungs can‚Äôt recover COVID.

That‚Äôs long haulers exhausted time. lungs longer operate 100% capacity. another example dumbfounding, exasperating stupidity see nearly every Covid story days.

Onboard *Diamond Princess*, estimates basic reproduction number (R0) wild-type SARS-CoV-2 [as high five times estimates urban Wuhan. Given subsequently learned, predominant mode transmission exhaled persistent aerosols, shared ventilation systems common cruise ships, R0 seems high plausible. Delta variant way transmissible wild type was. [This puts R0 (in ordinary urban contexts) 82% higher, [this 97% higher. 

So we're looking onboard R0 possibly 20s. *Everyone* sharing berths shared ventilation gets exposed there's shedder upstream. given older demographics cruise tourists, that's lot breakthrough infections, even everyone fully vaccinated. Bring unvaccinated children board, get 1% chance hospitalization, 1 1000 death.

Hard see cruise industry survives (certainly current ownership). Probably terrible thing, insofar environment concerned. Norovirus enough keep away decade, rotating cast variants may enough keep away rest life. hope Sinovac work Delta. country, Philippines, we‚Äôre still fully vaccinated 50% vaccines supply sinovac. news breakthrough cases deaths among HCW coming neighboring countries using Sinovac. Still proper data regarding effectiveness variant. Since mentioned delta arrived two months ago, probably gonna expect real life data country effectiveness delta since chile provided best published data Sinovac far. much want this, going work. We've tried last year everyone complied lockdown, social distancing mask mandates. delta situation, try again, people comply. call group A. group B. People comply kinda edge complying not. people, might surprised lot people also democrats well, go complying anymore.

In group B's mind, given promise quarantined, virus would end could go like normal again. promise coming through. feeling lot counter arguments flushing pipelines mind. Yes should, lot people feel way.

At end day, leader provides solution, needs pragmatic. unfortunately. still might best solution. moment virus became politicized solution requires restrictions, going turn way think will. Restrictions regular life contentious low income part society value ""FREEEEEEEEEEEEDOOOOOMMMM"".

I disagree mindset, unfortunately is. unvaccinated people young ,healthy less likely hospitalized?
I'm saying vaccines shit good touted(90% effective prevent infection 95% prevent hospitalization death).
Those data gave people false hope pandemic enough vaccines derivered.
Sure, might blame Delta call another pandamic blame unvaccinated people.
But clear tough situation expected. 

Personally, I'm fearing vaccine reduce risk severe COVID good enough prevent long COVID long lasting damage.
Indeed, lots comment vaccnated people got COVID lost smell taste.
You might call fearmonger plenty ""fearmongering"" proven true. read documents? issue around people mixes vaccines politics. doesn‚Äôt make sense. ü¶Ü would want mix vaccines politics?
I‚Äôm rightie, family righties, guess what? ran vaccination centres soon able to. even killed laptop mouse üòÜ hurry centre going close soon (and couldn‚Äôt go morning company work gave us afternoon off).

Sorry, get anyone would this. myocarditis real concerning side effect vaccine. 6 month old understand desperately wanting vaccine also want safe parents feel comfortable we‚Äôre going need majority children taking it.

We've never freedom country. true freedom. restrictions, need ask restrictions make sense.

This coupled fact sides trust exponentially makes worse. example, heard right? masks mandates, NEXT? afraid slipper slope never give inch side reasonable not. Yeah I‚Äôm surprised would also surprised Covid spike adults providing older teenagers alcohol well well it‚Äôs stressful everyone I‚Äôm condoning time wouldn‚Äôt surprised  think lot extroverts going mental health struggles whiplash CDC dropping mask mandates Delta surge.

This probably true, but--at least far, expect remain true highly vaccinated areas--things really slipped far backwards.

We wear masks, capacity restrictions gone. Large outdoor events back. Restaurants back, hopefully institute vaccination requirements.

With small number exceptions--hopefully becoming smaller third shot authorized immunocompromised--we mostly stress loved ones dying.

It still OK indoors fully vaccinated friends family.

We *much* closer normal today even April, try focus positive. Checkout r/nursing people enough. people fighting virus. Others fighting truth. Covid planted mint makes great mojitos.  Meanwhile he‚Äôs begging federal troops sent save failed hospital system complete lack available peds ICU beds‚Ä¶ almost. much worse get people stop supporting governors like ones Florida Texas watching state get overrun covid without anything help situation. Brazil splendid vaccination system country. covid crisis; like decades. Now, antivaxxers everywhere, true, debate politicized US, example. simplistic reason Brazilians supposed do. And, no, vaccination optional, enforcement kind whatsoever.

Before year's end expected Brazil reaches full vaxx +95%. shall see...

Note: 99% city S√£o Paulo, biggest one population. BTW, everybody uses mask there, even little ones kindergarten. Fuck no. still don‚Äôt want catch even vaxxed.I‚Äôll taking precautions things calm return semblance normalcy. lovely, like whole country cares fellow people want help.

I would like people wear masks indoors, that‚Äôs pipe dream now, I‚Äôll settle clogging wife‚Äôs ICU preventable illness (day 7 13 14 hour days saving unvaccinated, it‚Äôs running fire fire day even team residents (only time she‚Äôs ever worked hard attending Florida last January, brutal, almost bad much better area)).

Just want fewer people ICU, it‚Äôs damn taxing (my kids don‚Äôt understand don‚Äôt see mommy much anymore, thought over, acting badly, poor guys). imagine white white supremacist org. good grief. respond found sources, surprisingly hard find‚Ä¶ got deleted incivility. 

I found article talked length hospital vaccination rates reported cdc basically useless state departments health aren‚Äôt reporting data.

Either way calling 50% nurses antivax complete bs. Every hospital requires vaccination records work. approval Sinovac's coronovac. 

Pfizer vaccine distribution requires better refrigeration system. rare American lack means transportation. Pfizer's efficacy rate higher. make Pfizer available adequate infrastructure. 

The vaccine passport system like European countries (and New York City) adopting makes sense USA.   thought every death mattered?

Tens thousands every year influenza chastise COVID vaccinated, influenza vaccinated? Seems like virtuous trying lead people believe. know true I'm spreading message works. Either way, state public funds went somewhere already, like thier friend's business.

Florida took big revenue hit 2020. Sales tax really tanked, Unemployment Compensation fund got drained. Right effort build accounts back pre-pandemic levels. think governor's original objective, he's probably chuckling playing out. I'm saying that, I'm saying: Trump's COVID politics zero impact Germany's COVID politics, probably little Europe's whole. sure won‚Äôt pay critical care though, they? That‚Äôs Profit! Honestly second person said ‚Äúconvo‚Äù blocked them. full shit anyway. formal study comparing Rt vaccinated unvaccinated exists, doesn‚Äôt mean logic shorter duration equaling less spread guessing. It‚Äôs logical conclusion. Instructions unclear, waiting government pay $600 take vaccine. /s treat home Facebook, Twitter, GOP approved medicines. Oh, don‚Äôt forget thoughts prayers. Awesome, thank you! group fully go :)  quote George Carlin ‚Äî 'Think stupid average person is, realize half stupider that.' board ed's lawyer saying funds federal government would still go state DeSantis could still block funds. true?

My friend‚Äôs dad got one couldn‚Äôt stand wait hour two till son available help. Bad decision.

Luckily ER‚Äôs state aren‚Äôt full less damage thought. beds available nearest hospital me. live highest vaccinated county Ohio (68.9%).   There‚Äôs articles shows Gorge, lollapalooza, others. Infection rates I‚Äôm seeing seem averaging around %1. Pretty good considering hate treading waters want sound like apologist, think examples apply way intend.

First, 3/5ths compromise applied slaves, free African Americans. also applied population counts determine taxes owed &amp; number seats house, individual's freedom access Representatives direct Taxes shall apportioned among several States may included within Union, according respective Numbers, shall determined adding whole Number free Persons, including bound Service Term Years, excluding Indians taxed,¬†three fifths Persons.

Basically, north said south needed pay taxes, since sides counted populations differently. south said increasing population count increase representation federally. north want give slave *owners* extra votes, since represent wills *slaves*. alternatives (a 0/5th rule 5/5ths rule) impact legalization slavery general civil rights. mess, sucks anyone hear ethnic group would considered *less others* legal context, wide application commonly think had.

Second, Dred Scott Decision concluded African Americans intended recognized *American Citizens* constitution, among terrible ideas (like removing federal government's ability limit states' abilities allow slavery). shortly civil war, overturned decades compromise north south, increased tensions leading civil war. also mess, one *way worse* implications 3/5ths compromise, result existing fractures union rather intentional federal decision. 

Lastly, overruled 14th amendment, means neither practice civil rights movement century later*.

I agree American history mess racism abuse still present day, think useful relate civil rights movement laws &amp; circumstances time, like legalized segregation &amp; limited federal protections voting rights.

*Note: assuming referring ""civil rights movement"" explicit period 1950s 60s, general push civil rights &amp; protections Reconstruction era on. However, still think examples descriptive pre-Civil War era, rather state &amp; federal failings came afterwards. Parents need keep kids home possible.

Hard disagree. vital kids school. 

However, schools need incorporate mitigation strategies (e.g. masking, improved ventilation, pooled testing, distancing possible) make safe possible *and* FDA look data probably put EUA vaccine 5-12 year olds sooner rather later. like think still sane people insane ones hundred times louder waving guns around. Scary indeed. ran google translate. tell, hyped up, turned big celebration/festival/party. live music DJ's. aiming 100% first dose vaccination actually quite predictable sadly. saw many sources state soon got Texas Supreme Court would local mask mandates. think lower courts hoping trying buy little time. fully support mask mandates schools shocked school mask mandate opposed 30-60 year olds. Mask mandates bar one thing schools‚Ä¶? Many can‚Äôt even get vaccinated. article: actually said.

But yeah ready fortnite. you‚Äôre bad enough shape ICU admits you, odds favor.

And besides, I'm saying trials, course that, anyone point vaccine ever catastrophic results children adults? They've done trials, data, doctors opinion time approve.

2.	delta variant evades vax previous variants 
3.	first studies 3rd shot Israel (currently 1M people got it) seems positive. Protection doubles 50+ years old got it. probably extend rest population Gosh really?

I suspect would different public response Florida Texas. Perhaps got infected vaccinated? It‚Äôs apparently common delta variant original virus. people know breakthrough covid mostly symptoms mild ones, it‚Äôs easy see infection going unnoticed. caught habitual required testing. Super mature. Glad know I'm dealing with. I‚Äôm saying give entirely, think people make conscious efforts change want see. 

With time essence might take lot future generation(s) get us right path. I‚Äôd feel guilty bringing child broken world expect learn fix. No, Lee County.

For example, Amazon requires masks warehouses (operations facilities), Microsoft require vaccines entering buildings, Tyson foods vaccine mandate. see big companies news, mom-and-pop shops not, but, example, dentist doctor never stopped requiring mask.

Covid becomes Superbug somehow wipes humanity. 

Enough people get vaccinated/infected short enough time span Covid becomes like measles chickenpox. Endemic, enough herd immunity it‚Äôs global pandemic levels.

Covid mutates become super infectious, much less virulent, like cold flu. Herd immunity, via infection vaccination way. People get occasion, unless you‚Äôre young/old/immune compromised it‚Äôs shitty week.

All situations, excepting first, would option yearly booster shots, like flu. 

The fact people actively trying get sick people (pretty much) actively trying get sick what‚Äôs prolonging things.

That article fucking wild read Yeah, goal 75% supposedly met back June think. look math, 75% 75% eligible excluded 12s. instead 75% really mid 50% percentile. 

And reason managed get first 75% goal highly populated counties Multnomah, Washington, Clackamas achieved way higher percentage goal. rural counties especially along eastern Columbia river east along border Idaho bad anything see southern states. blending individual counties, state reached 75%. blending leaves rural counties generally boned populous counties large hospitals staffed ICU beds sponge patients get care area. Allowed accompanied vaccinated adult. 8yo child, 7yo grandchild 4yo grandchild cannot get vaccine yet. school Fall parents refuse vaccinate themselves. school voted mandatory masks, know kids be.  altruism overwhelming. Vaccinated less likely go hospital.
This protect hospitals. sad people countries like Iran desperate vaccines many idiots developed countries refuse take think they're making political point so. Pfizer also contracted COVID within 6 months also ‚Äòmild‚Äô everyone unless want restrictions forever. 
It seems quite unlikely effectively eliminate spread covid even vaccination rate gets close 100%. Delta creates tok many breakthrough infections, infections likely infectious, r number infectious cases high. say that? No, clearly hasn‚Äôt based caseloads. Find something else comment every day thread.  course vaccinated people, likely infections, hospitalizations death amongst them.

Saying ""99% people getting sick unvaccinated"" complete lie however dated guy like that. ended paying everything time went out. What‚Äôs hospitalization *rate* though? Yeah there‚Äôs record number children hospital, also record numbers people hospital right now.. Good getting shots! mean, soon enough vaccinated going disease spreaders too. Vaccinated people still catch virus (even *as bad*), virus learn adapt mutate variants combat vaccinated environment.

Just wait see. guess whole herd immunity thing pipe dream. probably checked state database. colleges require certain vaccines although varies state public private school. I'm getting never ask card generally done back end via databases. Restaurants access that's reason cards used.  American society right now, American government officials ""de-funding"" police, major problem lol.  Doctors nurses well known lung damage. Double lung damage, since many double mask. /s

I know, argument, I'm flabbergasted anyone would think this.

Hopefully fewer getting sick due vaccination.

However, see viral loads decay sharply first days such, overall transmissibility would lower vaccinated, expected. yea, announced friday wallgreens announced today. pay takeout every time order, since wife refuses tip takeout even middle pandemic.

It's like can't afford tip. allowing shots auto-immune disease folks? keyword ""Lower rate"" ""deadly"" disease primarily killing non-vaccinated individuals conveniently mention. vaccines mandates protecting idiots stupidity. did, paid vaccine stood clinics nation wide.

They also loaded body bags, bailed failed hospitals.   Wonder many people arrested fake vaccine cards.

Answer: many.

I want everybody take step back think this.

People willing commit felonies (I assume felony. lazy look fact every state different laws... not, please, correct reply I'll edit thusly) willing commit felonies take life saving, free vaccine. American society right now.

Wow. seeing going well. app available NY residence/those got vaccinated NY. CT&amp; NJ can't use public states often come NYC.

We need collecting data: positive cases, many vaccinated, vaccine, when, now, get booster. Also, within positive case data, many previously confirmed case Covid, so, when?

With hospitalized ICU patients, thing: vaccinated, so, vaccine many doses, Covid previously, so, when? unvaccinated hospital ICU cases, Covid previously, so, when?  Yeah end goal figure produce antibodies en masse. actually anything. *pretending* to. Yeah whenever someone says say they're vaccinated, like ""it's private decision tell you,"" might well Arrested Development scene Ron Howard saying ""he vaccinated.""  understand different, ends bottleneck: breed llamas, inoculate them, extract purify blood, etc.

The thing is, expensive always enough doses. Maybe able tinker one cell lines make produce antibodies genetic engineering, see. True.

Unrelated, TX capitol building currently flooding. deny viruses climate change once! fix it... Thank you. I‚Äôm parent 8yo basically got hospitalized bad pneumonia every cold age 3 (around 20 times) times almost needing ICU thankfully never did. Usually high flow oxygen week. hospitalizations last 5 years, last one 2 years ago. It‚Äôs bumpy past year school whole time (never closed 8year olds here). question keeps is: delta bad symptom wise normal respiratory infections children comes lung issues specifically? worse (like RSV)? common get bad pneumonia from? 

Put another way: pediatric ward cold season full kids pneumonia kinds reasons, delta prevalent *and* ‚Äúgood‚Äù causing severe respiratory symptoms it‚Äôs cause significant fraction kids-on-oxygen there? pneumonia kids still mostly old reasons (colds, flu, rsv)? realize it‚Äôs early hard draw conclusions small samples. CDC conservative comes unknown risk. know children becoming disabled dying covid, especially medical care unavailable. know certain vaccinating children cause less harm long run. 

Basically, many kids probably dying attempt maintain CDC's reputation. actively abuse, humiliate insult deliver care. Refusing care simply giving want - thanking block treatment. Where‚Äôs 50/50 stat come from? Sounds like horseshit.   success story GOP wants model rest country not? feeling subs like r/minnesota actually pulling acting like total bozos. reminiscent medieval persecution scientists Europe. smart, talented, competent people punished hounded out. Bad times. yup, 3 week lag, 114 deaths day Tex fom covid, seen hit 300+/-100 understand common cold human coronaviruses hang upper respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 gets deeper lungs bloodstream passing deadly disease makes comfortable, wear mask? Vaccination defang it. making huge leap (in error) say spread amongst vaccinated mutation takes place. Mutations blind, random errors happen virus replicates host. Many dead ends go nowhere prove benefiting virus. unvaccinated spread higher virulent, causing severe illness encounters less immune response. 

Any time virus replicating host potential mutations arise. sooner immune system clears infection, less chance spread. curious everyone thinks rest pandemic plays zero-COVID countries like Australia New Zealand? Even get 70% people vaccinated end year, still 30% vulnerable. long keep borders shuttered? anectdotally Reddit, many countries still shooting zero-COVID. There's ""accepting risk"" driving car. also ""accepting risk"" taking hands steering wheel. Australia New Zealand pursuing zero COVID policies believe Excess deaths year year massive. bit different far know, specific smaller type antibodies produced camelids. bets r it'l cold one like last point emphasis needs hospitalizations/deaths avoiding COVID completely. Yea vaccines still pretty damn effective preventing COVID general true strength lies preventing serious COVID/hospitalization/death. takes 1-2 breakthrough cases anti-vaxxers get ""I told so"" bullshit. messaging needs upfront clear get-go. 

""The vaccines greatly reduce chances getting COVID. still chance get COVID fully vaccinated chances close none get seriosuly ill, hospitalized, die"". feel like messaging first emphasized getting COVID much backfired.  Lol  Time new oath values saving deserve first. Abbott wanted things. Horse serum used treat bacterial toxins venoms century point.  November-ish 2016? relate. need someone knows explain science idiots. able get message across people look world terms beliefs, first thing say thing they‚Äôll accept. explain nuance people accept black/white world. That‚Äôs experts CDC needs hire. comes systems getting overloaded think unvaccinated turned away-- callousness, unvaccinated makes risk less likely survive treatment, surge protocol prioritizes likely survive. then, even wanted vaccine get one whatever reason also suffer.

I know support route private insurance. one hand, poses extreme public health risk need explore options involve putting emotional burden doctors nurses. other, wary private health insurance companies use precedent set punish behavior seen negative one's health. It'd done carefully precisely.

I'd personally like vaccine mandates private establishments public sector jobs, fired failing comply said mandates able apply unemployment. can't literally force people take shot least turn pressure.

Edit: Also, yeah, they'll saddled ton medical debt debt vs dying still expect anti vaxxers lie deal money problems road. state perfect (far it), we've offers move states job prospects I've always concerned way states run. nothing sympathy took offers also like stuck there.

That said, glad move. Best luck you. wish could offer that. certain degree...but reacting COVID policy standpoint, already late tamp surge currently in. Please add BREAKING headline

IOW, mutated virus would survive replicate more, whereas viruses would killed disabled person enhanced immune qualities got vaccine. mutated one stopped vaccine. replicate (reproduce) person, person infects another vaccinated person, would viruses stopped vaccine, rather original virus. on.

So, unfortunately, vaccines creating strong selective pressure viruses favor mutations may reduce effectiveness vaccine. selective pressure occur infected unvaccinated people.

The bottom line vaccines really well preventing person getting seriously ill, doing, keep hospitals becoming overloaded. vaccines stop spread. create situation new vaccine-resistant variant likely arise vaccinated people selective evolutionary pressure.

I've spent lot time trying talk one-on-one growing amount data demonstrating vaccine safety pregnant patients (source: I'm sure well I'm getting them. seems like emotional decision part many nurses, dumping bunch data necessarily address concerns.


But, sure lot nurses vaccine-hesitant remained unvaccinated. Forbes article low nurse vaccination rates made-up stat. Less severe infection associated lower transmission.

These charts based data I'm scraping Texas DSHS [Texas COVID-19 Hospital Resource website. There's idea popularly called Swiss Cheese Theory, basically taking whole bunch preventive measures time order beat back pandemic. virus conceptually gets holes one line defense hit another line defense whose holes different place. military calls defense depth. think way going now, relying magical vaccines magical masks single line defense.

(We use approach prevent traffic fatalities. seatbelts, airbags, crushable steering columns, traffic signals stop signs, safety barriers, manner things directed towards goal.) 

I think global society done good job enumerating different things could stop covid, lot countries actually many once. US many countries gone all-in one particular defense, vaccines, cheerfully abandoned anything else. seeing limitations that. Yes sure, likely won‚Äôt die rising number hospitalized kids. Plus, documented cases kids long haulers. possible long hauler symptoms scariest thing kids me.

Also don‚Äôt think flu nothing. whole family gets vaccinated every year. light end tunnel point? True shorter period time. Healthcare circus. professions also saturated many new grads significant amount debt can't find jobs. Delta replicates rapidly nose causing high viral loads regardless vaccine status past infection. causing breakthroughs reinfections. many unknowns long term effects COVID, acceptable time.

Death measure, negative outcome. Tf? Gotta catch em' all! Look death rates age.. fact live world kids always exposed diseases, given data reason worried kid catching covid flu.

We‚Äôve even tried going shopping dinner last couple days we‚Äôve promptly turned around. DFW area mind blowingly screwed. well Detroit metro area quite coming, wary moving quality life superb imagine fucking lines? I'd skip right Abbott go Gohmert, though. Probably Mitch that.  Ok learned clause. Doesn‚Äôt clause completely undermine federal constitution? Wasn‚Äôt point federal constitution explicitly detail federal powers restrict states? 

In case clause seems allow states regulatory control anything Feds aren‚Äôt regulating, feds regulate it, right? We're getting close million excess deaths since COVID started. undocumented COVID cases many result people getting care need COVID. Even cancer patients dying able get chemo non-emergent care suspended. People avoided hospitals died heart attacks strokes home. 30 year old kids here. 

I got vaccinated practice social distancing masking babies. 

I hope know care vulnerable children. Appreciate sentiment!! here! Staying positive lol I'm childfree never thought extraordinary empathy you. know it. Truly. sounds exhausting, isolating nothing respect keeping sanity sanity family together. 

Well, part lie. schadenfreude. towards women outwardly told horrible woman kids. use mitigation measures protect you‚Äôre nervous theoretical long term risks Long COVID vaccinated yourself. long hospitals aren‚Äôt overwhelmed health system isn‚Äôt threatened sickness deaths mostly control cannot expect everyone take burden ease anxiety. nah know decades effects Long COVID vaccinated people seems effect (if all).

That isn‚Äôt acceptable personally - governments society move on. I‚Äôve cautious mode whole time wife immunocompromised in-home therapist. refused go back office luckily boss understood.

My wife freaking Delta variant exclusively deals at-risk youth schools reopening week. 

She always sessions outside we‚Äôre worried fall winter can‚Äôt. sucks telehealth therapy children problems remote learning does, more.

There‚Äôs many different ways pandemic affected people. touches many parts society, really saddens people choose get vaccinated. post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Don‚Äôt get wrong, Travel Nurses we‚Äôre making bank pandemic see lot like ‚Äúpeace out‚Äù while. Also, Brazil used biggest vaccination campaign world, terms percentage, course. Also, every kid study public school, must vaccinated. Also, points increase likelihood Brazilians wanting vaccine
* every kid go public school must vaccinated 
* tv propaganda encouraging Brazilians get vaccinated common 2018, new president got elected. Public Health Service even mascot vaccine. called ‚ÄúZ√© gotinha‚Äù
* national vaccination campaigns every year flu seasonal diseases 
* even Indian people middle Amazon forest vaccinated 4-D chess Desantis get extra federal funds Thank checking! referring cases school, understand school isn‚Äôt publishing data. Thanks  Yes still tourists over, parks still pretty busy.  know northeast are.  lot friends parents NJ retire move central/southern NJ west. went Delaware.  sales tax buying house selling house NJ got good nest egg new house.  move away cities. Close enough stay around family cheaper area. know states like like here.  Depends age, health status, level location exposure. are, minimum, keeping 11 year old home first week. calling school tomorrow see options short pulling entirely. I'd prefer that, to. 

This going pretty, see getting worse year progresses. parents ""respiratory arrestles."" Hospitals capacity.   None links contradict comment, specifically deaths among children. kids getting sick, ending ICU, reporting I‚Äôve seen says hasn‚Äôt increase fatality rate among children.

As adults vaccinated, children make increasing proportion unvaccinated population. It‚Äôs exactly unexpected would also make increasing proportion infections hospitalizations. 

As case throughout pandemic, reporting continues provide statistics without enough context draw meaningful conclusions. Statements like ‚Äúx% new infections children‚Äù ‚Äúy% new infections among vaccinated population‚Äù useless without knowing percent population children percent population unvaccinated. told ‚Äúprobability patient child given infected.‚Äù want ‚Äúprobability child infected.‚Äù different things, keep reporting same. can't see smile hospital bed. metroplex exactly **zero** pediatric ICU beds available right now. There's telling many deaths occur solely lack ICU beds. areas waiting months could easily death sentence. posters seem suggest T-cells hero. possible completely misunderstood them. they're vaccinated they'll ok. numbers facts correct. There‚Äôs something else play though, FDA ignores design: FDA thinks risks children themselves, absolutely regard threat unvaccinated children spread virus community, immunocompromised members family.

Part living society willing take risks protect others. It‚Äôs fair kids soldiers war, war is. 12 year old was, said, almost zero risk severe consequences COVID, willing eager get vaccine beat enemy. Many also willing take risk, including parents. 

Maybe say 5 year old capable making choice, parents force them. counterpoint, risks vaccine, worst, maybe slightly higher risks disease. vaccine still tiny risk, potentially massive payouts society, put kids greater risk driving back forth school every year. cares people die political career jeopardy???

""Other people may dying that's reason lose good career, I'm set life!  think Mississippi elect someone party!  Ha.  thing worry someone outflanking right! Sorry kiddos! Hahahaha"" Often hold months years pending review  love shit. experience yes. note 3 doses, getting mine Walgreens doesn‚Äôt appear accurately tracking anything. would venture say could go walgreens cvs get another shot.

as example here, got pfizer first shot, went book 2nd shot would let book moderna, walked in, signed release form got 2nd pfizer shot.

that week ago still says need 2nd moderna dose app. never checked ID anything. report anyway case ever decide pursue case. record tried multiple times still released means suddenly give accounting someone ""legal review"" taking long unusual. Poe's Law working overtime last couple years, swear. Yes strange shut last year basically nothing things get worse. Children unvaccinated, though. following mass casualty triage protocols‚Ä¶children first. can‚Äôt help decisions parents (or school, governor) make.  Pfizer turned data? assumed FDA can‚Äôt anything receive data blaming Chinese happening get-go seem convinced anybody believes ""theory"" get vaccinated. whipped bunch anti-Asian racism.

I took Sinovac I'm hoping good news, really solid vs earlier variants despite people say, still waiting good data showing efficacy vs Delta. way governments acting implementing boosters mixing doses Sinovac inspire confidence. Oh, knows. care. bother one bit. Much like Greg Abbott. That's shtick. They're untouchable. They're rich. They're powerful.

I hope pay done one day. incompetent fool. Deadly incompetence Plz send help won‚Äôt get vaccine hospital? Ok hospital young. private rooms set long wards curtains. Nurses go aisle taking temps etc. passing aspirin that‚Äôs level care deserve. want live without vaccines. Get healthcare gave pre vaccines. *Seattle* does. 5 million people state live places that, uh, don't.

My area (north King county) vaccination rate 90%, surrounding zip codes. mountains, vaccination rates like South.

Also, graph cases shape lot country's, put absolute per capita numbers graph, half tall. Basically, we're 500% much lower number.

Finally, King county - overall vaccination rate around 70% (80% eligible people) - case rate almost January, hospitalization rate half high, death rate 1/5 high. cases still going way I'd like, especially well-vaccinated population, we're vastly better last time cases level. Oh man totally respect childfree friends - it‚Äôs everybody (and often lol) pandemic really wasn‚Äôt bad overall due various circumstances etc etc friends kids way struggles first chance pace rough feel bad opportunities experiences kids didn‚Äôt get since things weren‚Äôt normal. got 3rd shot last friday.

Texas dump. left California never go back. seen much superintendents get paid? TF would care whether got paid think people got shots early, people first line 3rd shots 6+ months already 10-20% vaccine efficacy. 
That said, country fucking stupid right can't even GIVE shots away, need fucking billboards PSAs cajole people getting vax'd.

I‚Äôm shocked pressure stress last 18 months, combined distressing, sad reality 20% people brazenly selfish care themselves, PLUS realization companies 0% empathy cares actual well-being employees, drove people drink. returned work July office announced day masks weren‚Äôt necessary since vaxxed employees could return. 2 weeks ago announced masks mandatory. employee came last week coughing day left early. It‚Äôs unvaxxed risk, it‚Äôs still everyone, lesser extent everyone vaxxed. 

Other kids 12/people can‚Äôt get vaccine, sympathy anyone refuses gets sick. feel bad can‚Äôt want it. notable people brought kicking screaming intensive care units show devastation covid caused due negligence. need held accountable. 

This true evil Totally makes sense. sucks!  Honestly, difference vaccines. much worse 99% deaths choice. Thst makes huge difference vulnerable. 84% people 65 fully vaccinated probably helps. shift new talking point. matters they've claiming 2 years turns flat false.

Just like people 6 months claimed Covid made media would disappear January WTF What's prevent going getting revaccinated?

Say got J&amp;J April, go local CVS, wherever, Moderna get that?  Can't Biden order nationwide mask mandate public spaces since national emergency?  wish actually technology anti-vaxxers seem think possible born raised S√£o Paulo, finally allow bit relieved. second jab Friday, seeing news like makes hopeful. We're gonna get nightmare. Totally agree! makes sense, though. 12-16 similar 16+ use exact dose.

Children biologically different need different dosing, etc. what's alternative? shortages real I'm sure higher salaries fixed issue.  am, reasons get flu shot. benefit better benefit.   hope knows over, legacy remembered immoral, unethical, spineless fish.  Yes. saw someone else link ad Florida hospital paying ICU nurses $9200/week 13 weeks. Presumably pay available entire year, surprised 13 week assignment still available first round...

If staff nurse hospital paid similarly, bet ass I'd gone moment refused match pay. Assuming could afford leave, anyway. medical field discussed two 5 kids vaccinated. Looking stats doesn‚Äôt make much sense. I‚Äôd pick outfit compliments N95. medical field discussed two 5 kids vaccinated. Looking stats doesn‚Äôt make much sense.  pretty obvious want disclose it. embarrassed probably want people flooding messages saying ""well get vaccinated, deserve it"" attempted murder, plain simple.   Cognitive dissonance. Oh yeah guess got backwards. feels like politically conservative :p kid‚Äôs school required testing. drove testing site. allowed observe collection. kid tested several times knows it. said person collecting sample went around outside nostril.

Is new thing? they‚Äôre collecting legit samples, we‚Äôre lot trouble.

This Los Angeles. empty threat. knows can't really this, also knows people (a lot people, unfortunately) blindly follow look kind strong arm tactic, standing freedom. knows look fact can't this. 

This another attempt pandering followers. Miami 79% one shot seeing 114/100,000 cases day. Stay safe. almost like MIGHT something extremely low statewide vaccination rate... EDIT: realized guy I've replied earlier

Tbh I'm Brazil maybe I've known ONE antivaxxer. entire life. even one took vaccine. really thing here

Even dumb fuck president encouraging vaccines (just chinese one lol). kids took it.

I'm sure 99% pretty close it. kinda trust data Sao Paulo's governor Jair's direct enemy fake we'd know   don‚Äôt even physical tasks work, still find really annoying. I‚Äôm software developer sit day computer. honestly uncomfortable enough impede concentration little, yeah I‚Äôm little bummed wearing one again. follow football pretty close, live norman economy football.

I heard texas highschool football actually inflated bubble. Teevee says ""d'oh"" Another pharmacist fun fact. Volume distribution (Vd) called. drugs basically stay blood others love live fat. Oh come on, friends full shit. Lol. 4th dose? getting first shot Thursday‚Ä¶ cares? vaccine hesitant/anti vax take anything real twist needs

However, us vaccinated still deserve informed continued relative risk, articles headlines fine.

Not sure stop research reporting breakthrough infections especially prevalent maybe entails vaccinated. Let. Them. Suffer. way.  always believed America could it. know, hear here, actually make income tax instead trying live tourism! They‚Äôre fault too. It‚Äôs like they‚Äôre asked something complicated. 4th dose? 96% doctors vaccinated. 99% covid deaths unvaccinated. Go figure. stop getting sooner? everywhere else 3 weeks Pfizer. seems weird.   great idea. charge premiums health insurance unvaxxed make pay tickets, Broadway flight movie concert.

Even dumb fuck president encouraging vaccines (just chinese one lol) war ending every shot gets free gun. Yeah Manhattan done this. party. They're leaders point. They're failures. Florida‚Äôs vaccination rates aren‚Äôt evenly distributed. counties high rates counties low rates. varies region. comments scary show screwed. Obviously overwhelming majority vaxxed, majority country vaxxed! Yeah, country wide centralized database, databases there. 
They proprietary rather invisible average person. 
I got email insurance thanking getting vaccinated. 
A sibling happen. 
Neither us gave insurance card info got jab. Also take account really began spreading Chinese New year. way contain Wuhan, many people moving in, Wuhan Mostly due extensive gerrymandering ensure Republicans continue rule supermajorities despite majority support. Texas manages continue shit show regarding covid despite majority Texans wanting reasonable covid measures. got back one. NDA. 100% vaccinated crew customers. 60% capacity, mask wearing enforced pretty well. Lots mandatory hand washing safety briefs. 

One initial people coming cruise tested positive arriving boarding. isolated board. Another 1 person tested positive cruise. isolated removed next port. Everyone given antigen tests, though PCRs also available, around 2 days prior departing. 

I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôd see many typical cruise demographic Reddit, let alone share political/ideological leaning subreddit, would actually respond thread 99% comments stupid. countries large unvaccinated population, usually case. countries almost everyone vaccinated, obviously majority infections vaccinated people. Texas really intellect goes die... leaving Florida. translates them. infected. 2nd Moderna shot. Hit hard 0200 morning got dose lasted ~24 hours. interesting older folks talked reaction younger folks peers discomfort. I've felt crappy flu shots 24-36 hours discomfort small price pay protection get vaccines. Ooh boy. One wild. I'd LOVE hear reasoning /proof behind this. Don‚Äôt forget immigrants  ""California reported 14,099 new cases Friday, highest one-day total state seen since February 1, 2021. 
\- 
Looking state‚Äôs historical chart case counts, today‚Äôs 3,649 extra cases seems largest one-day jump pandemic, though days missing official state record."" freaking expensive, though. However, vaccine freely available anyone walks pharmacy months, Covid gone.

That's necessarily true though. Children forgotten whole ordeal, FDA dragging feet approving vaccines kids 12. day kids able get vaccinated enough time passes get immunity, far over. I'd like know percentage people died voted Trump That's exactly Bolsonaro said 15 months ago Stupid SOB bright side, rate Americans moving Texas, eventually flip blue. Bye. amazing children death rates remain constant despite half adult population getting vaccinated. new adult cases almost entirely unvaccinated people, children unvaccinated people twice likely children vaccinated people catch covid. 

Get vaccinated. Wear mask, require schools. Stop putting children risk risk easily dramatically reduced. sore throat, cough? Sounds like vaccine working. Sadly true. rigged even funny. past couple years I've seen absolutely astounding timeouts Democrats many cities Texas. Yet somehow Republicans still winning land slides. surprised majority Texas indeed blue. gerrymandering districts absolutely insane.  dunno, lot colds rhinovirus coronavirus anyway?

Definitely masks hand-washing cut colds. vaccinated masked. Mississippi 50,245 fewer residents Arkansas according latest census. Mississippi 35.47% fully vaccinated. Arkansas 38.02%. 

Mississippi exceeded daily new covid case numbers end June, it‚Äôs continued grow. anyone know daily hospitalization, ICU, vented numbers?

Arkansas stayed well daily new case high winter. However, Arkansas exceeded daily number hospitalized, daily number ICU, daily number patients ventilators. 

Both states schools without mask mandates. 

Mississippi admitted hospital system close collapsing. Arkansas appears slightly better, hospitals full many diversion daily. 

It interesting see much difference extra 2.55% people vaccinated makes. find archive link? Congrats wife, beat 200 people! That's impressive! \*before\*. travelled packed LIRR trains years, delightful. People looked like crazy December 2019 talking unknown virus.

Heck, US people still thought crazy January / Feb 2020 taking big would evidence China shutting down.

There stuff there. also first heard December 2019. close gyms istg What? procedure cost?
What hospital website.

I really trying procide arhuments solid ground here.

But good point, websites never lie, amirite? fair, fully vaccinated people things without much risk. It‚Äôs unvaccinated started behaving like figuring could cake eat too: go back normal without getting serious Covid case getting shot. 
And June early July smugly thought got away it. delta they‚Äôre stubbornly diving heels die. Health Ministry Monday rolled series new rules vaccinations, lowering eligibility age 15, introducing fourth doses speeding vaccination period people tested positiveChildren aged 15 above, children aged 12 older chronic illnesses, eligible COVID-19 vaccines Turkey, authorities announced Monday.Turkey last lowered vaccine eligibility age 18 bid boost vaccination program 83.6 million doses administered. 

The country also changed period first dose vaccine people tested positive coronavirus. able get first dose month test positive, instead three months later.

Under new rules, fourth dose available people vaccinated third dose, 21 days last vaccination. Health Minister Fahrettin Koca later clarified traveling abroad required received fourth dose. countries require two doses Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine entry, people received two doses Chinese Sinovac one dose Pfizer-BioNTech jab, able get second dose latter vaccine fourth dose, according Health Ministry. ‚ÄúNo additional doses required people two doses messenger RNA (mrNA) vaccine three doses inactive vaccine,‚Äù Koca tweeted, referring two vaccines available country.Vaccination vital country, especially amid concerns delta delta plus variants. 

Though vaccination mandatory, Health Ministry repeatedly appeals public jabs. country lifted almost restrictions, including curfews, July 1, decline cases thanks accelerated vaccination campaign arrival vaccines China‚Äôs Sinovac Germany‚Äôs Pfizer-BioNTech. Yet, vaccine hesitancy took hold provinces certain age groups. Without vaccination, fears fourth wave pandemic occurring. slowdown vaccination drive also worries public, experts still urge stay away crowds.The rise daily COVID-19 cases, fell 19,000 Sunday fluctuating around 20,000 long time, blamed unvaccinated. Professor Ata Nevzat Yal√ßƒ±n, infectious diseases expert Akdeniz University Antalya, said hospital 90% COVID-19 patients intensive care people receive vaccines. unvaccinated also make 40% patients hospitalized COVID-19 university's hospital, told Demir√∂ren News Agency (DHA) Monday.

Yal√ßƒ±n said unvaccinated unable gain sufficient immunity coronavirus suffered severe bout illness. ""The vaccines prevent people ending intensive care and/or hospitalization,"" Yal√ßƒ±n said. ""The rate people doses vaccine still around 37%. number exceed 60%. need faster vaccination, especially autumn, respiratory infection cases increases,"" Yal√ßƒ±n said. Yal√ßƒ±n also said three doses vaccination good protecting people nine months doses could required period.

Increasing number vaccinations depends ""persuasion"" Turkey mobilized everything, securing sufficient supplies jabs population lowering vaccine eligibility age. Health Ministry already runs awareness campaigns convince get jabs. Mobile health care crews go door-to-door 81 provinces talk unvaccinated getting doses.

Associate professor Ersin Uygun, psychiatry expert, said persuasion efforts focus ""undecided"" instead ""anti-vaxxers."" Undecided reluctant citizens among majority abstaining vaccines according authorities. Anti-vaxxers, hand, thrive social media conspiracy theories flourish.

Uygun told Anadolu Agency (AA) people reluctant ""are worried vaccines would them. wrong approach people though 'threatening life others.' understand concerns act forceful way,"" said.Uygun said concerns people reluctant receive jabs triggered ""swift process"" pandemic. ""There race find first vaccine. Phase trials accelerated vaccines received emergency approval. worried people made unsure whether vaccines would harmful health long run. Turkey example, different data efficiency first available vaccine (China's CoronaVac) different countries also fuelled concerns among people. vaccines (Pfizer-BioNTech jab), data likely cardiac side effect drove concerns though infrequent side effect. may nothing compared fatal impact coronavirus people, evolved something concern,"" said.  third dose would think fine. would go get 2 shots each. dont think smart move Ah yes, border state of....

Being provax antivaxx part political debate happens Brazil, pro anti-bolsonaro matter situation hearing since pandemic began, ended contagious variant weakening. Covid asymptomatic spread, enough slow burn body dont believe this. Plus millions people even believe covid real. Covid viral form Rick roll far, US high risk area, test required vaccinated. I‚Äôm getting tested feel like right thing do. still carry transmit COVID, want protect people around me. work healthcare, felt good back tested week. relief know wasn‚Äôt asymptotically carrying people. stopped May.

Steroids different story. absolutely reduce efficacy vaccines lowering body‚Äôs immune response. mod bot would exclude post due title edit think clueless public health care system works, well reasons put Bolsonaro power. I'm mood explain.

All say comment based random opinion, original post based data. enough anyone. Damn, suck. look internet anti-fog pastes! I've bought mine japan incredible. time noticed SLIGHT cloudiness glasses 33C (92F), raining heavily walking street. make difference! School started already lot areas area week. Fortunately, school district implemented last minute plan make option online schools, family participate in. whole thing shit-show. know go steps prove actually home schooling? Still tests benchmarks need hit. simple thing government pit many hurdles possible. Laughs Path train.... da thing said SS Minnow. like say Pro-birth, youre own. Thank report, sounds like much better now. testing peaked, mean cases peaked. infrastructure count them. Also, keep mind 40 hours x 19 weeks = 720 hours.

That's states require EMTs. example, Cali, EMTs require 170 hours training paramedics receive 1200-1800 hours.

Also, probably required take CE (continuing education). work PD security, even need take CE keep job. agree you. juat know risks. doubt think protecting child cps come take you. ever seen Wall-E? toddler plays outside niece nephew one toddler close face. says need stop pull back like last year due delta (we north high transmission creeping up). I‚Äôm worried social development (she‚Äôs great great people) peers age. cancer (not active treatment) I‚Äôm worried development, let go anyone vaccinated (we vaccinated). Thoughts? want keep safe. Wondering anyone boat us. Give walking around NYC day, something makes uncomfortable leave Real people suffer die, politicians play games. one held accountable beyond me? system fucking broken. Similar numbers flu then? deserve it, keep dying Fuck guy Could 78% COVID patients (those hospitalized) obese overweight?

Begging question likely indicates know shifting blame without trying take credit making invalid statement. Long COVID symptoms happen lots people hospitalized, going anecdotes know least two previously healthy kids stop sports COVID wrecked would also mention symptoms treatable (this good thing).

ICU nurses end wearing 12 hrs COVID sentient. What's happening people selfish people dying it. Signed, Texas resident. There‚Äôs saving us long term major pain whole. Atlantic currents slowing down. methane pockets Russian tundra releasing, ice cover glacial cover retreating faster ever, former arable land turning deserts‚Ä¶ food water crises come next decade two, inevitable wars. watching angrily deer eat garden. shrug outside big cities vaccination rate high OR. overall state high vax rate counties high low.

Some rural counties less 40% vaccinated, highest numbers pandemic surprising. fairly strong mandates / lockdowns time.

State opened virus started taking unvaxxed population.

There nothing surprising here. Yes.

Turkey vaccinated medical workers, elderly vulnerable Sinovac vaccine early year. concerns diminished immunity Delta variant offered third dose, either Sinovac BioNTech, every person age 50 higher vaccinated Sinovac vaccine.

Because countries accept vaccine schedule, government offering fourth BioNTech dose BioNTech vaccine third dose. myocarditis real concerning side effect vaccine.

This argument toward you, FDA thinks tiny possibility myocarditis vaccine even comparable side effects actual COVID they're idiots. Yes, due diligence maybe publish paper warning studies. Make parents sign waiver something, leaving kids sitting ducks rare side effect usually clears even happens. wrong, friend. Whiplash good way putting it--first confined, given green light go again, may confined while...One mental ""trick"" use help deal remind many deadly epidemics history, many times normal life replaced fear disruption--and times advent modern medical science. Vaccines, themselves, around long, still many them. trace back Edward Jenner protection smallpox late 18th Century, Louis Pasteur rabies vaccine late 19th Century, vaccine research really going till mid 20th Century. parents, example, lived terrifying Polio epidemic early 1950s, relative mine actually contracted crippled it. So, summary, remind look long span human history, outbreaks dangerous infectious disease norm exception. freedom naps  That‚Äôs kinda hilarious imagine something don‚Äôt want mess anti vaxxers would use justification forever, dampening hope future vaccines kids adults reason fence. would want scenario, guess sense already enough people sadly keep thing going years. Mask/vaccine mandates may saving grace can‚Äôt keep playing game people getting vaccine still vocal minority keeping afloat enough point still able create insane spikes cases. bingo! Exactly point. Vaccinated needed unvaccinated rode coat tails reduced restrictions. Looks like Taiwan quite well. home county 60 cases. much government much cooperation/culture? posted outline link first place?   think save us fact renewables objectively cheaper electric cars way objectively cheaper. People things greed would never right reasons.    askreddit thread said best: Apathy kill humanity. simply allowed. Think back Alpha swept facilities wiped whole wings out. 

I remember health care workers could get first vaccinations thought ""they must relieved."" I've shocked insulted since people health profession chose get vaccinated.

What fuck industry help people?? Good bot. someone suffers every day it, don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd change life able bodied fear long covid already vaccinated.

For counter anecdote, talking parents yesterday found kid friends kids athletics school found can't participate anymore. mild case COVID last school year went go start working summer much pain scanned lungs they're working 70% now. teenage boy street similar situation already knew about. I'm hopeful young individuals regain lung capacity point serious side effects even ""mild"" COVID cases looking bad kids. see point adults necessarily physically active though. think saying would withhold pay, cut budgets. So, next year they'd let people go bending will. totally see thing, actually know much power there. great, great response, learned something small study Israel indicated breakthrough cases (at time Alpha variant) get long haul symptoms similar rate. Again, that's one study need data. 

""Nearly 3% medical workers new Israeli study contracted COVID-19 even though vaccinated, 19% still symptoms six weeks know scared happy but... finally!!! necessary tough unhealthy too. Lots rabbit holes. Low risk compared huge negative societal costs properly educating children - particularly children disadvantaged backgrounds. think they're really logistics. US military best logistics world. realize kids infect unvaccinated adults? Yes, cases started trending days ago indoor mask mandate reinstated 1.5 weeks ago, may something well.  know colleges universities N/E hitting 90%+ vaccination rates staff faculty students. guess we'll see breakthrough cases pan out. Drove way Louisiana years ago. Stopped fuel brief lunch McDonalds off-ramp exit.  see dead last education true. I've never met many bewildered people life. Studies already shown vaccines reduce long Covid symptoms quite bit, Delta shown rarely make lose smell taste, I‚Äôm guessing lot anecdotes aren‚Äôt entirely true see right are: far past peak yet done deal anything. currently, accurate say cases trending down. vermont highest vax rate currently infected entire first wave. Link please. Low risked based study? Low risk compared what? 
Similarly, homeless never file bankruptcy masters capitalism. scooters dangerous chances catching COVID. 3 weeks way know suspicious. Brazil never faked data. worst cases covid worldwide everyone knew, Brazil Russia/China suspect seeing, there's plenty opposition government can't silenced. reports might bit flawed somewhere they're, sure, misleading. say 99% sure least 95%.

Sao Paulo governed one strongest oppositors obviously yes often/significant Man, even outdoor hikes beaches closed county around 3-4 months last year (and beaches HUGE. Like go 4th July still easily 10 feet space around you). brutal. would drive hour away go hike empty area since trails city shut down. miss days.  bad time question existence you‚Äôre lose Florida, rate probably somewhere bad shite. live West Coast I‚Äôm flyover state. Reading Facebook wall morning encouraging. read deaths people hometown scroll bit read evil vaccines are. feel like I‚Äôm living bizarro world people owning ignorance wearing like badge honor. Yes. Hawaii 72% 1 dose? gal first dose fully vaccinated large doesn‚Äôt seem recent surge people getting first dose. Sometime around April large amount people get first shot large uptick 3 4 weeks later second shot. Even purist hearts intentions quitting field nursing. Yep. show us real numbers logically assume worst. Yeah county 57% 13.6% case levels. 
We going see real mayhem. 
If kids still ineligible I‚Äôd say ‚Äúlet er rip.‚Äù 
I see return least partial household shutdown looming. brain fog couple years long time ago. It‚Äôs joke. partner work covered one occasion. super lucky get control. That‚Äôs true. Middle managers get barked top don‚Äôt increase bottom line units run. feel bad good ones, stuck rock hard place‚Äî trying get/retain staff higher execs won‚Äôt allow it. People keep saying ‚Äúhospitals still ok, they‚Äôre capacity yet, there‚Äôs room ICU, ventilators‚Äù. - doesn‚Äôt matter ventilator room odds surviving literal coin flip. Get vaxxed give much better odds making this. time new vaccines target new variants.  haven‚Äôt slowed. Testing max capacity hospitals full. There‚Äôs actual way know slow criminals hiding data. Fully vaccinated middle school teacher (most 6th graders old enough yet shots) knowing I'm fully vaccinated wearing mask, feel safe enough teaching face face. delta variant rip unvaccinated population really fast

Right half u.s. population unvaccinated. 150 million people. 200,000 new cases day would take two years infect everyone. time would likely new variants may infect vaccinated well.  Link please. 
Key difference, among many, overwhelming majority Swedes believe science adhere public health advisories. 
There‚Äôs really comparing US anyone, Sweden didn‚Äôt political party holding series super spreader events throughout 2020 2021. don‚Äôt kids, relate working thing. happy finally go back office could actually set ‚Äúhours‚Äù again. opposed working home separation work personal life.  talk doctor suspect find breathing well noticed functional issues exercise tolerance recover might take ""What matter CT scan shows causing problems going lead change treatments prescribed. case, risk radiation?"" stance. LEAST!  Yee Haw Anecdotal evidence, couple days ago died yet. got Pfizer shots March opted Moderna booster low. I've heard countries approved mixing two, felt relatively safe decision. 

Felt bit weird getting unauthorized, got what's best health idiotic segment society give shit anyone else caused mess. mild case covid May 2020 turned 8 months long covid hell. I'm young, healthy, overweight, underlying health issues. long covid could happen original strain, terrified getting Delta might affect since worse younger people original.

I'm certain boosters approved everyone sometime fall/winter, work announced we're going back office September, can't wait they're officially approved. say, what's right you. pretty much every person point.  also doesn‚Äôt matter ventilator - nobody left trained difficult process calibrating maintaining functions patient‚Äôs specific needs. Beds don‚Äôt matter don‚Äôt trained staff care patients. Hospitals horribly understaffed existing staff burned disaster. generally wish ill upon anyone, deserves exception. get sentiment kids ""anti-vaccers"" they're still 12. I'm pissed anti-vaxxers too, wish people would stop acting like people unvaxxed unvaxxed choice. rural VA county fair last week, several neighboring ones held fairs recently. Everyone back normal. Tractor pulls rodeos. Barely masking. distancing. Crowded indoor events. 50% vax rate county (around 60% adults). 

It's going mess weeks time school start. least school mask mandate (although grumblings pushback, course. Because, know, virus affect kids. Oh, case numbers fabricated too. Can't trust CDC! exact conversation neighbor last week. Good times).

 kids virtual, we'll watching sidelines.

Meanwhile, 40-something, healthy, unvaxxed family member ICU COVID pneumonia. unvaxxed 40-something, healthy best friend COVID 2+ weeks finally supposed get medical attention today. context, MOH already advised avoiding strenuous activity second dose. incident came light (the teen finished first dose), extended advice first doses well.

Poor kids school staff. stress anxiety must high knowing unsafe environment due lack protocols. thoughts/choices bringing children in... Yep, redesign cities pedestrian cyclist friendly, combined public transport.  headlines lead vaccination hesitancy people bother read think. Deer comply CDC guidelines. social distance, wont wear mask, wont get vaccinated.

And dont cross roads designated crossing points put deer crossing signs. :-) Got used it, weird first weeks without. Went vacation last week June, really thought could see light tunnel, two weeks later boom. meant change title would affect mod bot would remove post itself. next time may try though, thanks tip. I'm sure I'm getting probability right, assuming stay contagious 14 days, Covid test catch everything first 2-3 days, right? negative Covid test unvaccinated person 11/14=79% efficiency preventing Covid transmission, vaccine. Sorry, anyone care unvaccinated? think question safe. is. question effect mixing vaccine efficacy. anyone link study I'd grateful.  *what happening climate change. government job secure fair trade keep peace. all. government reason every political figure whatever get misguided constituents vote greater power, desantis wants presidency  Stand strong.

Wear fucking mask. course fall foliage Vermonts busiest time right concerned. thanks :)  powerhouse cell! Yep, I‚Äôm moving too! end year. I‚Äôm getting married October we‚Äôre gone. supposed move May last year, everything fell covid hit jobs shut down, including jobs lined up. another year watching everything unfolds astonishing. I‚Äôm always baffled. parents making worse children. I‚Äôm sick hearing, ‚Äúit‚Äôs flu. flu isn‚Äôt serious. Covid real. Masks don‚Äôt work‚Äù. know schools didn‚Äôt last year? Stomach virus breaks. Why? everyone wore freaking masks. want know parents going small children end virtual bc schools shut weeks months. gonna hire babysitter? Work home? forced quit job home child? think. You‚Äôre alone people thinking you‚Äôre crazy. We‚Äôre vaccinated, I‚Äôm asthmatic, prone severe bronchitis pneumonia. learned pretty quick people think I‚Äôm nuts tell I‚Äôm vaccinated. people that, ‚Äúwant things go back normal‚Äù. Well, unless virus eradicated, it‚Äôs going to. understand mindset. I‚Äôm glad family taking seriously aren‚Äôt adding fuel fire land mass Louisiana Alabama. ^ Yep, it‚Äôs game man society know it.

Best case scenario- *entire world* switches almost immediately green-energy; undergo mass-revamp agricultural sectors; invest replacing wide swaths natural land; create massive carbon-sink technologies - able *mitigate* damage. reduce change 1.4 1.8 degrees Celsius.

The damage climate done, planet inevitably continue warm - even every human disappear tomorrow. 

We moved beyond conversation stoping climate change; conversation mitigating damage, repairing Earth best can. governor loves seeing smiles kids. That's downside xD IMO, proof vaccination PLUS test PLUS masks way go, least waves, since COVID still spread vaccinated cause outbreak. cases fall hospitals capacity, drop test mask mandate require vaccinations. really fully vaccinated. 60% graph state looks ominous me. sharpest increase cases since pandemic.

Like said almost many cases first wave shit society that.

Just curious fall bring. Typically August respiratory illness nonexistent parts Many places probably waiting FDA approval they'll mandate too. think Amazon wants workers getting sick calling weeks?

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* need CT scan. risk taking it?

Extremely limited risk. basic understanding everyone needs it

This isn‚Äôt true yet. Israeli data shows 6 months. aren‚Äôt real tangible level breakthrough cases 50 compared unvaccinated groups. 50-60, rises. 70+ seeing LOT breakthrough cases.

So unless 50 years age, it‚Äôs uncertain it‚Äôs medically necessary. Now, could radically decrease ones ability get virus spread real world evidence yet. Guess we‚Äôll find out. Electric cars? Thry healthier environment. u think electricity comes from? horrid chemicals thr batteries? need better way. oh im italy im guessing whatever caught isn‚Äôt probably! it‚Äôs dragging three days, plane i‚Äôm guessing got way (not uncommon ime), i‚Äôm worried! (yet lol i‚Äôll get test start getting fevers symptoms ofc) *did* think person fully vaccinated would probably give protection coronaviruses‚Ä¶ maybe lol. glad hear you‚Äôre better though! This. COVID know think anything. People ones actively choosing keep pandemic going getting vaccine. hope worst rather, last worst. one knows sure. thought we'd woods now. would vaccine 5 year old little ""benefit""?

Because children almost always deal Covid perfectly fine without vaccine - unlike diseases like Measles. vaccines prevented infections transmission would different story. saying posted link comment, modbot would remove it? think so. Americans suck math. people choose vaccinated wear mask public. hard? Perhaps tourists getting one dose getting second else where? sure. strange. Wow, bet like dorm room there. thanks. Sure? Predicting virus always gone poorly. Nytimes gotta get paper None. could get 2 million cases day would still put economy human life. fear mongering comment? Sounds like mild annoyance comment implies something much ominous. it!? Whoa! Yes. *assuming* people rational reasonable pretty irrational unreasonable thing do.  think proof vaccination only. need switch digital system, get ahead fake vaccination card shit. two ways evaluate public policy: along ""working/not working"" axis (common liberals), along (perceived) ""right/wrong"" axis (more typical conservatives). Pragmatic vs. dogmatic.

I know Dr. Fauci's personal political leanings are, like good scientists, makes decisions recommendations based observed effective, even (especially) supersedes used believed. pachyderm party pretty much dogmatists time, Fauci's approach perceived ""weakness"" ""flip-flopping"" elements, thus hostility.

Plus made former president look bad. *That* unforgivable sin. ban mask mandates? purpose serve help encourage people *not* wear one? think make look like strong leader? 

He displayed Resolve. listened Hoity-Toity Scientists. think read. passionate learning day I'm planning cruise 2023. Hopefully thing control, I'm holding breath. Funny story, honestly thought low opinion humanity (and especially little slice that). Imagine surprise realize hindsight much faith humanity actually 2019! Economics, trade, business relationships, open immigration, separated families, psychology nationalism. Modern history filled reasons sustainable.

This knock them--cheers AUS/NZ they've done. point though, they'll need decide manage COVID never going away--even vaccines. looks rising case numbers, Australia might getting point gets decided them. Worst US state maintaining hold ranking worst state US *shrug* White people dying gets news coverage. 

It's still minorities taking worst (one reason certain politicians pro-covid). I'm confused. says need stop, untreated cancer? reading 'risk level' based factors outside covid like population density, age population, income, risk level change much given area pandemic regardless fast virus spreading.

Daily new cases per 100k marks bad things right now, infection rate indicates quickly things going get worse (or better)

Vermont looks much better south daily new cases per 100k -- however infection rate currently 1.36 Vermont 1.15 Florida -- covid actually spreading faster Vermont Flordia moment.

'daily new cases per 100k' bit like velocity 'infection rate' bit like acceleration.

While great Daily New Cases Vermont much lower south, concerning peak infection rates highly vaccinated states matched rates states low vaccination rates.

This seems suggest new, contagious delta variant, original projecting 70% vaccination low (as would expected). unfortunately, since 30% population seems hellbent getting vaccinated.

Alas, wait get 3rd shot -- hopefully added delta power, make plans stay workshop passes over. But, fortunate enough opportunities. Delta loves school.  receive Nielsen CPG sales data month. alcohol sales past 18 months eye opening say least. Well obviously...But Covid never deadly irrelevant. quite. 

NSW seeded states, tough measures slowing things states. QLD zero new cases today, aside mask mandate closed borders, business usual. I'm honestly politicians point. They're turning America full blown nightmare. ones spouting medical opinions? go med school. I‚Äôve found using Firefox clearing cache/settings pretty reliably convince still free articles read. coughed deer???? try stick routine. Heavily drink two nights week. Alcoholism heavily runs family really drink fuck noise. wondering taking place practically fully vaccinated country hope US have?

I go reasons comment wrong and, honestly, little bit elitist. say this: basing argument THINK know place. actually know.

Poor people necessarily stupid. poor. check prejudices, actually leave Switzerland talk people making assumptions places side globe.

Bolsonaro charge health care system data, influence change it, matter hard tries. And, did, would probably try opposite downplay importance vaccines, boost it, antivaxx himself. 

You would know lived here. don't. well. need boosters sooner. pediatrician say? Assuming parents kids vaccinated, would think risk fairly low, especially since play outdoors. I'm parent, two young nieces (5 3 y/o) I'm speech pathologist, social development part field. best extent possible depending doctor's recommendation, would try allow child continue playing kids. understand need keep child safe protected, key time development already getting life experiences toddler normally would able have. family bubbles guys join? aunt, commiserate. nieces immunocompromised, 5 y/o attending virtual kindergarten... already last 1.5 years pre-k online. interacts little sister cousin. observed adverse impacts social development. think kids generally bounce back typical social-pragmatic area. Also, working school private practice, seen significant impacts social development virtual kids. anything, appear eager get world, play make friends. slightly.

From non existent basically.

Still negative impact way life people, example grocery store close two weeks town w one grocery store due staff catching covid

Our deaths overall super low vast majority nursing homes.

Last checked 1 death age group example empty smoke-and-mirrors threat show. ""red meat"" base. Remember **love** ""tough guy"" talk, stern father figure, ""little guy fighting system"" messaging. most, all, Republicans act like tough guys ""fighting"" ""evil system.""  Covid refers set symptoms ‚Äî severe fatigue, brain fog, headache, muscle pain sleep problems ‚Äî persist weeks months active infection ended. syndrome poorly understood, studies suggest 10 30 percent adults catch virus may experience long Covid, including experienced mild illness **or symptoms all**.


A little louder pro-vax, anti-maskers. point largely - get variances depending area - bars restaurants open capacity restricted, concerts happening, etc., etc. That's massive difference. referring graph page 35?   awful lose-lose situation.

It's problem virtual classrooms noticeably worse children in-person learning. Social emotional development halted many children simply unable concentrate. factor problems like unequal access technology, unhealthy home environments food insecurity (lots children rely schools feed them).

On hand people going continue catch virus die. exactly vaccine hesitant hurting refusing vaccine. children good answers different shades awful. get son vaccinated it‚Äôs approved, really want approval happen FDA got flooded calls? FDA approve know it‚Äôs safe, many people call complain Hopefully Jess Hardy live see 31. two hour cruise According French, Instagram Facebook posts showing success around edge cases. Everything pretty much fits bell curve (mathematical exceptions course). stories outlier moments otherwise ordinary (right middle rest us imbibing, crying, stressed parents). Something little red hen comes mind.   think requiring needed. Wife fully vaccinated currently home sick COVID. showing symptoms vacation Mexico. passed 48hr departure test flew home. tested positive day got back. feel terrible thinking may infected plane home :( vaccine failed stopping us getting COVID (not supposed stop it), 48hr pre-test failed stopping infected people (us) flying. please link studies Biden already called people commended defying order. This. honor system joke. Mandate vaccine. Enough ‚ÄúbUt MuH fReEdOMS‚Äù mouth breathers. look vaccinated outbreak well answers I'm sure shown deadlier. know Delta contagious, would expect kids get it, even IFR kids before, would expect dying. That's say same, that's saying can't really tell hospitalization death numbers alone. Instead, would likely require in-depth studies I'm sure done yet.  Wasn‚Äôt 7 people? Edit 9 study followed 1,500 Israeli health care workers four months received Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. Anyone tested positive 11 days second dose considered breakthrough case. people ‚Äì 2.6% total ‚Äì diagnosed virus. One immunosuppressed; rest healthy, including nurses, maintenance workers 37 people data available infected unvaccinated person, usually within mild symptoms; rest none all. weeks diagnosis, 19% reported still least one symptom: loss smell, cough, fatigue, weakness, difficulty breathing, muscle pain. Nine employees ‚Äì 23% ‚Äì healthy enough return work 10 days required quarantine. One gone back six alpha variant virus, contagious original version, less infectious delta variant accounts cases United delta dangerous addition contagious remains unclear, Jha think too. 70 pounds overweight. asthma. former smoker. picture poor health.

Last summer, jogging 2 3 miles day summer wearing mask absolutely fine. Agreed! statewide numbers misleading. look local areas vaccination. Covid never caring particular group people, protecting health service collapsing. I‚Äôd guess answer comment‚Ä¶ generally speaking, adults vaccinated, children not. 

I‚Äôm also sure deadlier right term here.  Flu comparable it‚Äôs seasonal, dying summer. Plus flu, immunity highly strain-specific, vaccinated infected people bring Rt last season‚Äôs strain.

With Covid, people recovered original Alpha strain quite well-protected Delta. Delta way infectious shown many lines evidence, peak viral load 1000x higher, epidemiology studies, way displaced variants matter weeks country it‚Äôs reaching, way it‚Äôs defeating contact tracing quarantining formerly successful countries like Vietnam Australia‚Ä¶ Oh deer, hare ewe goat agama! literally milions people U.S. forbidden state federal law getting vaccinated. simply true vaccine available anyone walks pharmacy. That's important reason try keep protecting folks government willing let everyone get vaccinated.  ""No masks required vaccinated people"" using honor system mistake. Like, obvious would happen.

I vaccinated months I've never display card anyone order anything. dumb. Thank reason is, one research paper Minnesota univ (I think, dont hold it) found modernna shot considerably effective delta pfizer. would great go modernna given choice know safe.  Millennials Gen Z becoming ""take job shove it"" generation. Love us. Well already blaming Biden illegals.

However think give much credit forethought. think it‚Äôs simple businesses party gave huge ass chewing last year face implemented state mask mandate. He‚Äôs coward wants protect political career costs completely unafraid republican base ever holding accountable democrats winning election. honestly look intrusive expected. 

that aid, yeah i'm probably embarassed wear one. tooth fairy.  point unvaccinated going whatever already gathered large groups/ going bars somehow expected put mask follow rules unvaccinated folks. follow rules anti mask. like china [archive link anyone trouble accessing article ‚ÄúThis in, parents need fucking break. Turns out, get booze. it.‚Äù ones 60% major urban centres... might wearing week+ old paper masks.

I maintenance machine shop awhile pandemic. 8 hours day mask labor work. New masks breath hell lot better. I'd put brand new one start day fine. difficult raise young kid work full time pandemic, truly think lost hope humanity that's hit hardest. never million years thought could happen... pandemic - yes. way I've watched people society react? Never. totally shattered optimism, think hardest part want son catch actually feel. He's innocent want able believe people good world safe.  one single dose J&amp;J offer 71% effective protection hospitalization, it‚Äôs really fucking good shot. That‚Äôs better one shot everything else far. enjoy cruising. Unpack shit see ton places, new one every day. I‚Äôve seen Alaska, Norway, British Isles, Mediterranean, more. Many places would never chance see timeframe traditional travel flying staying takes lot time, money, effort compared cruising.

However right wouldn‚Äôt go anywhere near cruise ship, even though I‚Äôm fully vaccinated. Covid way many ways end stuck cruise ship much longer planned. imprisoned tiny cabin ship idea fun. Andy also followed father Steve Beshear Governor 2007-2015, pretty popular Kentucky politician. So, brand recognition, guess. Adding that, Andy ran Matt Bevin one unpopular Governor‚Äôs Kentucky long remember. Paywall, want post article?  Well like Jesus said, ""Fuck thy neighbor. suffering, problem."" I‚Äôm going devils advocate minute remind everyone can‚Äôt let million anti-vaxxers die. economy can‚Äôt take hit. put context, annual Neshoba County Fair. People purchased cabins every summer fairgrounds open up. like one large house party. election year politicians show make speeches. 

Our director state health reported outbreak people attended stayed cabins others thus spread virus.

[These Yep lasts months year Yeah makes sense, thanks info! nursing homes already understaffed hell. tempting fire unvaxxed staff easy answer. can't residents getting care all. Fox News covered DeSantis damn much, Tampa Bay Times massive expos√© relationship them, based emails obtained office: China: see told you! US. becoming highly especulative part point... guess people want right.

Anyway, unless show solid data contradicts number, think leave alone ideas.

I'd rather trust data proven health care system scientists cnn-level worldview. Goodbye. done nothing, Florida schools would able mandate masks wanted to. Cities experiencing surges would able require masks local lockdowns control spread, wanted to. Cruise ships leaving Florida would able require vaccines wanted to.

His actions tied hands school administrators, city officials business owners. He's done nothing good, he's done plenty. That's flatly true. Yes, replicates lower tract, damaging lungs. think that's letality rate SARS-COV1 high back then. lucky quickly. since available adults people started act like available everyone. think anyone unvaccinated deserves die risk chose take, kids choose that. parent trying protect kid I'm less less able so. required send school year. remote learning, district decided mask optional, even elementary schools know none kids vaccinated. they're letting kids know exposed come school show symptoms. governor overruled masks, likely hold vaccinated. vaccine using?  Well 50% people smarter average person. don‚Äôt think data supports this‚Ä¶ 
The media certainly latching onto right kids going back school need clicks scared parents. certainly anecdotal stories children becoming sick dying, overall risk still incredibly low children doesn‚Äôt seem changed Delta. young kids masks school, making smart choices, etc. data seems show mostly media scare tactics.  gonna call ThEtA variant. Theta gang checking in. know getting downvoted, there's truth there. Withholding funding going hurt DeSantis, FL GOP. people proudly killed federal unemployment state, rejected funding public transport. 

They would *ecstatic* able fundraise drive news headlines ""the Feds taking money mouths babies 'politics'"" would heartbeat, matter hypocritical might be. 

It might make us feel good ""publish"" DeSantis, yet right punishment -- one makes us ""erect"" think it. again: J&amp;J AZ. use different virus different chemicals. 

J&amp;J + Pfizer/Moderna may give great response also might not. Studies needed. did, often need referral doctors give referral want it. want valid reason. said couldn‚Äôt comprehend why, 18 months pandemic, many continue doubt seriousness COVID-19.

Easy comprehend accept dealing cult. children hostages too, complete picture.  Far fully vaccinated, many European countries vaccinated many due soon. makes ton sense. Probably important factor tbh. contribute lethality? primarily resides lower respiratory tract? think people care others. R.I.P. Dio. also really ramped May 2020

I believe mean ‚ÄúMay 2021‚Äù. Sounds like they're handling well without completely shutting business...

... sounds pretty tedious what's supposed relaxing vacation. I'd rather stay home personally. hope good time though. Good news, hope vaccine hesitancy gets better well, far understand conservative Erdogan party members vaccinated look like political get vaccine, also refugee wave coming quite dangerous public health perspective. They're one top rated shows Cable, larger reach now. fucking suck unfortunately growing popularity. kind wanting Carnival stock tank :) would love buy sub $10. go away... take get gains. Thats limited politicians Ehhh aren‚Äôt wrong either. Rich countries got vaccines first vaccines poorer countries. India expected country saved global south help COVAX federal government refused spend money boost production Delta forced horde vaccines. What‚Äôs disgusting support admiration gets policies COVID. Saw Tiktok video day 80% comments praising him. again, Tiktok cesspool misinformation prepubescent trolls. highly recommend buying bunch different masks trying many different kinds available now. horrified thought wearing blue medical masks day work uncomfortable made face itch. Spent $50 masks Amazon Etsy found can‚Äôt even tell face I‚Äôm wearing them. I‚Äôm tired seeing people masks 10 times big small. Unless really can‚Äôt afford there‚Äôs excuse able find mask works you. Rio vaccinated 86% adult population far, even slowdown doses delivered federal govmt. We're going 18+ population vaxed pretty soon. difference ""whatever wanted"" previously restricted. legal fun makes money. love cruises... even unsanitary selves. Prob cause korn situation Vaccinated still spread covid19. likelihood spread greatly reduced. everyone vaccinated would problem USA. recent test competitive. 

I would ask ""why both"". Individual test kits cost $24 2-pack. Concert tickets normally around $100. increases price one eighth. antigen test door misses people incubating low viral load. matter event people going spread yet. 

It would help mass testing. Sterile individually packaged swabs cost around $0.20. single lab test conducted large group swabs tell anyone group covid19. Send notice everyone sitting section one people section covid19 verifying none. 60% county like 20 people isn‚Äôt exactly big deal either‚Ä¶. What's thing bought made go away? Feel you. laws never met son live foreign country parents dead. would literally kill someone help didn‚Äôt pay $20 hour. wartime we've forced people put lives risk good country. vaccine mandate would forcing people *save* lives (as well protect people). yet, forcing people avoid killing family would trigger mass outrage. understand insanity... They're going ignore new cases sweep rug. see hear speak must real seems philosophy.  World Cup around corner. Can't risk missing that. like good portion americans hellbent viewing fauci enemy. free side covid. shit, mom believes vaccine makes magnetic. got vaccinated, tries stick spoon injected arm see fall off. failed over, want admit it.


Now moved goalpost assumed Sinovac contains magnets (I got Pfizer). Dear lord help me. CDC's tracker us 500 deaths per day...  Thats cheap way looking it. Even kids third world countries educate reading old books find. education systems funding, desire self derived motivation. literally nothing stoping kids going library learning whatever topics want. 

People lazy, plain simple. That‚Äôs usually sign you‚Äôre asking right questions. thought educating child illegal? IE can‚Äôt choose educate Children. went Texas December making $120 hr $180 hr overtime. worked 6 days week. intended 3 months but
I caught Covid nearly died long haulers. work me. FL fucking backwards. Getting ravaged delta variant enacting bans mask mandates essentially works spread COVID throughout states. school kids start dying COVID, DeSantis GOP. *Because waffles??* 

Oh wait, no.  Wait till children school turns cooler. hope I'm wrong. literally impossible people still somehow realizing kids anyway. Thank goodness Dr. Dobbs. man must exhausted now, he‚Äôs wonderful whole time.  failed steak salesman? anyone sacrifice Republic game show host? yeah decade written? u/tool101 isn‚Äôt shit get it, devil's advocate  WHY!? fucking stupid!?  one care adult teachers families? Teachers allowed leave pay walk class even one petridish without mask. I'm ""crazy guy"" get one HEPA personal filtration devices pump clean cool air mask. 

Comfort looks. 

Think, battery, laptop cpu fan, mini furnace filter looking thing.

Clean COOL air plus fog safety glasses anymore seems legit fuck point. Unpopular opinion: frontline workers stop treating covid19 patients wont get vaccinated (unless cant vaxed)

They've done can. us now. Maybe lack healthcare incentivise morons wont get vaccine prevent deadly outcomes. course, mistresses limits. mother stage 3 COPD. oxygen. weekend, brother's ex-wife visited take son school shopping neglected inform us pending covid test. turned tested positive, learned already stayed night.

Needless say I'm nervous scared death. could take virus I'd heartbeat want anything happen mom. done everything well pandemic let somebody thought could trust.

We vaccines, we're West Virginia. state tossing whoever wanted super early, got vaccines March, second dose April. feel like bit us ass five months since second shot worry make mom susceptible it.

At moment we're trying get everybody quarantine difficult youngest autism hard time comprehending severity virus keep guard around house. feel like we're waiting bomb go I'm afraid happen does. reach Wednesday without anybody showing symptoms we're going try get tested since it'll five days exposure.   AFAIK, dominant mRNA vaccines US (Pfizer Moderna) expensive supply chain limited (cold storage requirement) really useful helping supply poor countries. Given vaccines aging US, seen compelling evidence giving booster way prevent delay shot given anywhere else world. Don‚Äôt know you‚Äôre definitely happening elsewhere. Misinformation polarization society limited usa. oversea region France seeing surge Covid 22% population vaccinated. politics facebook / whatsapp bullshit.  I'm mistaken, smallpox Supreme Court said Federal government could force states mandate vaccines. That's strongly recommending states enact themselves, states allowed mandate it. 

Might mistaken, think that's Fed mandating everyone, federal employees such. Everything legal DA state willing prosecute! Oh sure, know kinds quieter initiatives undertaken: literal door door vaccinations, mobile vaccine busses amusement parks fairs, name it. 

We‚Äôre going grind numbers, honestly feel like getting 80% minimal effort better many feared (after seeing US taper around 65% ish months). 

Still feels like able get 90+% principle (I assume 5-7% population kind crazy, that‚Äôs way goes), yeah, it‚Äôs going matter clawing last percentage points bit bit.  needs stopped

Stopped nothing? Since governments job nanny population? people Florida ones going catching covid... certainly arent going stop politician tells do. hand think us subjected Zoom school would blame them.   kids risk, they're fully vaccinated go private school masks required. true people like him.

It little people get screwed over, sort said Die Hard 2, kind notice little people see they're stepping on. going mutate regardless - 90% world unvaccinated. Delta came India.

""We know long term risk"" exact argument anti-vaxxers making justify taking vaccine. end day, make decision based best information have. pretend nearly much information experts, think meaningful US taking different path regarding school closures compared developed nations.  daughter 3 speech delay well. testing autism soon. speech therapy since March starting occupational therapy well. barely speed enough keep school. I‚Äôm terrified sending school amidst surge also don‚Äôt want hold back longer she‚Äôs getting closer kindergarten age needs able catch then. Good job! One need set foot Brazil know Sao Paolo absolutely vaccinated 99% entire adult population. city planet reached vaccination rate covid anywhere near high, city ever so. number completely preposterous.

No, new lesson plans developed.

However, sorry stupid question, work children young vaccinated and/or people rare medical conditions can't get either? assume kind medical card doctor? believe Facebook memes science. stupid. 1. anyone explain CDC's guideline says test 3-5 days exposure, many sources say 5-7 days? I'm genuinely confused this. I've read, test 3 days after, likelihood false negative fairly high.

Pfizer Moderna pretty steady output.

If 100 vaccinated people room 10 get Covid result transmission room ... result almost certainly zero hospitalizations.

That likely result 100 unvaccinated people room 10 get Covid.

As society, obligation keep hospitals capacity properly jobs keep us healthy.  incidents violence is, course, sad regrettable, two instances hugely populous state probably shouldn‚Äôt called ‚Äòboiling over‚Äô. like ‚Äòmajority support measures a-holes get violent‚Äô.

Is article says? can't read due subscriber. Furthermore, traveling EU still mainly restricted testing vaccination status--similar New Zealand planning vaccination rates high--so call ""zero precaution."" conversation amongst one thing, brought bantered around US forums excuse quit fighting covid something else altogether.

Well, that's many Americans read react headlines like think critically prefer driven emotions instead logic. There's logical reason jump ""let's make COVID mitigation liveable"" ""Let's absolutely nothing COVID let hospitals overflow!"" 

The fact Americans want ""live COVID"" they're willing put work make reality.  umpteenth time, even Sao Paulo SINGLE advanced richest city entire planet, vaccination rate 99% among adults would still impossible.  think COVID might endemic disease wave, get booster shots every year like flu, otherwise return normal?

Hope CDC vaccination places keep records / report 3rd vaccinations separately, data many people vaccinated get even muddied. Can't find info whether track it. 

I wonder many first dose recent vaccination uptick actually people getting 3rd dosages.  Agreed, cdc either idea communicate public know exactly they're want mislead people think world upside due covid 1-2 years now? Kids eligible vaccines, default reaction everything lockdown, world much higher % population vaccinated.

If really think current state operation default two years now, know tell you.   Exactly. CDC uses data figure think effective messaging instead giving us raw facts.

There still cases people still able catch covid, thankfully vaccinated get much weaker affect chose/unable vaccinate. still need wear masks, still carrier.

Unfortunately, due several factors (USA buying much world's supply vaccines, Anti vaxxers, supply chains, unable vaccinated) virus able mutate become stronger.

From cdc:

""Vaccines contain germs cause disease. (For example, measles vaccine contains measles virus, Hib vaccine contains Hib bacteria.) either killed weakened point don‚Äôt make sick. vaccines contain part disease germ.

A vaccine stimulates immune system produce antibodies, exactly like would exposed disease. getting vaccinated, develop immunity disease, without get disease first.

This makes vaccines powerful medicine. Unlike medicines, treat cure diseases, vaccines prevent them. everyone get vaccinated. Lots kids Texas hospitals Covid bc parents fighting stupid culture war making go maskless everywhere.  

Unfortunately, grown room. means forced compliance may required name greater public health interest. Something Supreme Court even repeatedly supported 100 years, starting Jacobson v Massachusetts. already are, albeit lesser rates non-vaccinated individuals.. long, knows? think hospitalisation rates vaxxed vs unvaxxed currently impactful stat justify mandates.  saw regarding spike protein effect cell function attaches receptors. also read CDC website mRNA vaccines ""make harmless piece called spike protein.""

This process seems like let lot people slip cracks think hard tell 100% accuracy, feel nature job they're going catch it, likely not, duty.

Even strike third still shit ton deaths. Shouldn‚Äôt people test vaccinated? point stop requiring people wear masks protect won‚Äôt protect themselves? It‚Äôs ridiculous point. always exemptions well. public schools lot states restricted mandating well. Actually said was

 ""Our data CDC today suggests vaccinated people carry virus, get sick, clinical trials, also real-world data.""

This March based study 4000 front line workers. said data ""Suggests"" might case absolute statement means. basically taken sample data pointing direction. know accurate data. study also done Delta variant dominant strain US. 

Do honestly expect never wrong learn new things? new virus still learning every single day. Thats example absolute statement one given based study. omitting information make things look worse are.  Moderna running phase 1 trials half dose 6 months first shots.

I‚Äôve taken care go pretty shitty/evil people day. certainly possible. wave, vaccinations still happening (at somewhat increased rate now!) completely plausible wave, US would 80% people either prior infection full vaccination (just projecting forward 42 million cumulative cases, 4.2x multiplier CDC estimated total infections vs detected cases, would give 55% people infected 55% full vaccination rate.) would give 80% people least infection vaccination infections evenly distributed among vaccinated unvaccinated people. reality unvaccinated likely infected now, probably north 80% coverage reach numbers. virus prefect weapon large cult individual. weapon basically free move around population argue social cultural norms individual centered.  Even population takes measures weapon new versions weapon brewing inside large number individuals ignore attack. type culture great breeding ground mutant weapons, many willing hosts work within. currently it. Tested positive Friday. feels like awful sinus infection me. headache body aches/chills weekend. passed feel like cold. J&amp;J vaccine March. Every single one good friends supports vaccine mandates. people know don‚Äôt, aren‚Äôt good friends. 

If guess people spheres‚Äôs support was, would 85%+. We‚Äôre already going events, bars, social outings 100% vaxxed, would open things us do.  think difference Nola proof recent negative test NYC vax only. Delta good head start Arkansas, seems spreading faster Mississippi. Might nothing MS students back school earlier Arkansas.

Highly unlikely. 5 days standard ideal testing. August 6 day one. student one infects student 2 incubates August 11. Student 2 immediately infects adult. 5 days later August 16 (now) symptoms strong enough motivate testing may take days. 

Covid19 *can* incubate faster. *possible* cases occurring yesterday today took route. think pretty confident vast majority not. 

A lot adults want take responsibility choices. adults gamblers. Many compulsive gamblers. feels good close adults. 

A bunch people seam eager shut schools. people balk economic damage shutting airlines, concerts, and/or bars. education seen optional.  take effort make schools function safely efforts need taken. Desk dividers, better air, mask, vaccine mandates whatever works. 

""It works"" needs determined measuring objective criteria. Good. really liked going cruises, good compromise spouse's wish visit places wish lazy vacation. also went cruise first kid 10 months old, great way travel baby.

Most cruising population retirees, I've also met families kids guy whose son wheelchair said best way travel.

This smaller German cruise line less party boat. said allowed bus grocery store? making bad faith argument? parents opt-out seatbelts kids? Download excelsior. Yeah seems like problem. hasn‚Äôt thought fully. haven‚Äôt heard anything places kids clearly can‚Äôt vaccinated either. AZ vaccine isn‚Äôt even approved won‚Äôt accepted. It‚Äôs almost like want maintain low death rate ?  feel pain. Always think well-being friend political polarization US lion share blame refuse get inoculated, anti-vax movement partially enables them. 

The third principle Ingsoc really applies here: Ignorance Strength. 

Get enough like minded numbskulls together, derail train.  Fun fact: enough people clap you, rent free month never liked either.  one indian state lifted lockdowns end may, lifted lockdowns height case peak middle may, many states lockdowns.

Cases dropped 75% end may.

Have tried googling india middle may may led drop cases deaths? think tried read sources, telling imposed lockdowns fact *lifting* lockdowns.

I give hint search terms use, would like. live Philadelphia. comment supposed sort joke also note many people technically allowed get boosters yet. It‚Äôs one day, watch trend. would great though. mean - really fun kids team accomplishment great - individual portion studying/tests. Finally - exercise great too.

Obviously doesn't' matter kids COVID want poitn out. sounds great. true still talking numbers new cases bringing back masks lockdowns restrictions. point time move argument passed point talking moving that. continuous restrictions next 10 years. 250% less 40% protection delta variant 2 jabs Many places taken cowardly ‚Äúdon‚Äôt engage‚Äù philosophy biological terrorists. Probably crazy fuckers get violent irrational Let‚Äôs honest, would preemptively strike first‚Ä¶.  Killing diseases die stay dead forever really, really, really, really monsterously difficult. done twice (smallpox cow disease). took US USSR working together rest world stamp smallpox.

That reason try. keep talking slums. Forget slums. Even Sao Paulo single richest, advanced city ENTIRE planet, vaccination rate 99% among adults would still impossible. Luckily chances getting first place greatly reduced, meaning transmission greatly reduced. bonus even breakthrough case, won‚Äôt bad. see lot misinformation saying reduce severity spread. Well, reduce spread significantly. people 100% protected get vaccine, however still breakthrough cases others happen, spread others. get r 1, means die terms community spread. lucky work parents caretakers. years ago needed help, driving doctors appointments, cooking , cleaning, etc. mostly home pandemic able remote learning kids. husband also able work home. going well hospitalized covid weeks starting October. parents probably got sick doctor's appointment chemo session. whole household caught it. dad went ICU day. Dad eventually died ICU covid related complications month half later. 

During stay ICU, husband unable keep school work youngest first grade. luckily position could mess schedule enough help kids school. oldest excelled remote learning youngest delayed speech needed help. got bad, year retake 1st grade. I'm really nervous know youngest needs person learning, still young vaccine. can't imagine hard would kids still old office job. Still ongoing, vaccine takes 2 months peak increases efficacy time falloff probably different meaning timeframe would different booster. original shots holding 8 months could several months it‚Äôs determined boosters would needed.  Belittle calling ""heroes"" make front line pawns without real power people looking fights. feel like I‚Äôm surrounded absolute morons. literal definition capitalism industry owned private entities profit. even trying argue here!? Matthew Kirby, age 17, happy-go-lucky teen loved play baseball deeply involved church. 

Matthew Kirby died late Thursday spending nine days intensive care. father, Stephen Kirby, posted Facebook coronavirus infection led myocarditis, inflammation heart.

Stephen Kirby posted wife also battling virus. wait recover plan memorial son.

Information whether Matthew Kirby parents vaccinated available. Yep, taking original comment refer both. UK appears mostly ok everywhere. US much. published research know of. Might sensible use recommended interval first second guidance, although truth place. went event Brooklyn weekend required vax. asked vax card checked one didn‚Äôt check ID. üò∂ Both.

The virus less dangerous vaccinated people.

We much better treating people beginning pandemic. Dude, that‚Äôs vaccines work. vaccine 100% ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è   literally US doing.

You mean full vaccination rate barely reaching 50% several states 50%, seeing overflowing hospitals? Yeah, there's lot going EU. implying US ‚Äògiven raising vaccinations rates‚Äô? would even hilarious.

The speech Macron gave anti-vaxxers would never come Biden's mouth know it.

Also, I'm European. Sorta lost there. 
How less alpha protection offered 90% 
And 250% Ya'll delusional think businesses minimum paid workers going extra work ensure public safety. We're back honor system. goes like this:

""Hi vaccinated""

""Yup""

""Cool, welcome.""   would people react covid?  first ""official"" US case January. March never begining. found even farther back Europe. know Tuskegee many black youths know it. poc friends mine got vaccinated. People stop generalizing. understand feelings behind kind statement, still millions children can‚Äôt get vaccinated yet fault own. seem better adults, Delta putting lot kids hospital, one knows long Covid symptoms might impact road. water wet percentage Republicans?

This political trolling, specifically. lot black Americans vaccine hesitant, well younger people skew left. I'd imagine around 70-75% people dying conservative? that's completely wild speculation. 

To extent conservatives killing own? lot people cannot vaccinated. Honest question, schools opened ""mask optional"" anywhere country successfully?

My district starting weeks, ""mask optional"", I'm expecting failure like headlines keep seeing, districts without issue necessarily make headlines...

I bought KN-95 KF-94 masks kid, enough first weeks assume forced re-implement mask mandate shut down, hoping keep safe then. Local police charge federal crimes.  right. go shots December handed card said dont loose it. Well random size doesnt fit anywhere ended folding putting wallet. somewhat surviving begins..... Surely move information onto new card? Paper really waterproof taken plastic.   got vaccinated March. I'm staying home. guess ended nice list somehow based reasoning? Like how? Can't get all? Zero symptoms? know several two shots like allergies. people would probably died zero shots (COPD, diabetes). lol? decrease 23 two days? state notorious fudging numbers?

We changed counting/reporting methods last week. read anything this. all. That's #2 #3 like me. hours feel good. ..but worst I've ever felt almost half white tail deer multiple states. national geographic article found every US state one white tail white tail deer US people state Florida.  course regularly tip kitchen staff restaurants, don‚Äôt know you‚Äôre suppose tipped minimum wage minimum wage living wage, tipping would unnecessary. that‚Äôs world live in. yet mayor's various towns/cities, refuse implement mask mandates. 
Thankfully Chick-fil-A near closed doors curbside drive thru only. least Palm Beach sane.  obviously, wish upon you. well! mandatory testing showing proof vaccination restaurants Germany months works.

You want caught following rules license severe trouble. nationalist strategy work.

Isolation (information bubble) polarization indoctrination radicalization. become homegrown terrorists. Take away ""line duty death"" status COVID deaths.  LMAO heard Florida considering well.   
  
  
  
/s neighbor obstetrician La Jolla San Diego, told definitely rich people baby boom Early September, theoretically. Wow. messed system here...  Lol I‚Äôd like see try. Fortunately Americans wouldn‚Äôt follow garbage Possibly, current trajectory suggest that. 7-day average lower states have, gone much past 2 weeks. flat true. exceptions course, like busy hours bars popular restaurants. busy hours, people working high end places larger tips regular make vast majority restaurant workers struggle even meet advertised wage job.

This lie upper class tells make enticing job. change mind unless post paystub Chili's server making $20/hr $30/hr bar tending Applebee's logged 40 hours week. think 200 represents indirect deaths. I'm assuming many, maybe most, ""cause unknown"" ""pneumonia"" deaths covid.

Inherent diagnoses several layers subjectivity. Excess death rates far accurate. I've 2 close contacts breakthrough infections got pfizer doses.

They're pretty much asymptomatic, would prefer ever get virus booster would prevent it.  never supposed to? Apparently Florida's hospitalizations decreased? Could sign peaking? UK, I'm talking (I see post responded also mentioned US numbers), believe case area. Large parts California fine.

It‚Äôs specific areas dragging things down. it‚Äôs great, area I‚Äôm still fine. It‚Äôs mostly inland rural areas also tend conservative.

Florida probably worse seem, given counted state people vaccination numbers. I‚Äôm actually sure know many people vaccinated.

It also comes overall precautions. Even vaccination rates similar, state mask mandates highest population areas going fair lot better. That‚Äôs what‚Äôs helping California. tipped service jobs provide livable hourly wage tipping makes shitty person

I'm curious, world think service jobs provide livable hourly wage coexist world entirely subsidizes workers, cost company, tips?

Nothing **ever** change tip subsidization keeps making okay pay shitty wages. might able get excelsior pass without card. moved New York NJ lost mine move. NJ similar thing called Docket able find vaccination info. 

A last resort also calling place vaccinated asking replace card. Good luck! Thats looking viral loads breakthrough infections. vaccine still lower chance happening come contact someone Covid 19. live? expecting lines Nova since approved boosters immunocompromised people health issues, checking cvs.com sites appts. unbooked.  live Harlem. think that?

Big yikes. least pretend like know definition system sucking off.  would validation knuckleheads. Ahh yes don‚Äôt inject something arm you‚Äôre allowed live life. Good job incredibly ignorant topic can't follow conversation. Increasing odds getting 80 percent absolutely means protects Covid. Nobody discussing hilarious attempt spreading misinformation asymptomic symptomatic, hey little dude, tried best I'm sure. 

 read past demonstrated intelligent enough conversation, awful day choice really. article mentions quote parent similar situation -

‚ÄúAs parent could think nothing escape plan. thought Hoover better this‚Äù said board‚Äôs decision. ‚ÄúEducation important us household, safety primary.‚Äù  Related? freshly vaccinated? we‚Äôre talking antibodies waning, I‚Äôm confused counting months first shot months two weeks post second shot. competent lookup system places people health insurance still get shot. never show proof insurance two. Unvaccinated people may dying much also taking ICU beds actually need them. think damn good idea. vaccinated (by choice) clearly care greater good society, welcomed it, say functions. flown.

That‚Äôs wonderful! Rt different R0. changes time. first R0, goes due unsusceptible people removed population, due immunity lockdown whatever else. likely reason Rt lower right lot immunity. absolutely lot deaths, except comparison outcome vaccination would likely drop number zero. COVID appears closer chickenpox measles kids, narrative letting kids catch end world really based (or [cdc original problem kids catching COVID always give grandparents. Even grandparents vaccinated still biggest problem. Yes, way makes sense. Abbott, defender freedom.  leading. bad direction really don‚Äôt understand - easy solution cut infection community. Compassion-maybe children idiots. told CDC ok many experts. Following science time sudden puts us ‚Äúselfish‚Äù category? 

Also - yes - many people mentally suffering past year isolation happy time huge weight seemed lifted shoulders could see loved ones friends again, vaccinated without fear. 

‚ÄúSelfish lives?‚Äù aren‚Äôt basement dwellers reveling doesn‚Äôt make us selfish. Things change I‚Äôm taking reasonable precautions (emphasis reasonable - I‚Äôm living like hermit - shame me). 

But seriously - people angry it‚Äôs healthy. Sorry second sentence made seem like ration care unvaccinated ration care vaccinated. comment unclear.  killing them, fact still transmit virus. anyone, including kids protection own. crap Florida gets, least say /r/Florida /r/FloridaCoronavirus seem censored Wouldn‚Äôt better educate population analyze crtically assess information rather let stay sheepishly stupid try try prevent propaganda? it‚Äôs misinformation.

To clear supporting actions. see pickle in. Texans brain remember next year? they? think lot extroverts going mental health struggles whiplash CDC dropping mask mandates Delta surge.

A lot family ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt even Covid anymore‚Äù mindset. employer everything get us back office.

The cognitive dissonance, even highly vaccinated areas, going intense coming months.  Must cuz ""fully vaccinated"" nightmare. I‚Äôm sorry live it. That‚Äôs literally said. can‚Äôt vaccinated now, even could care shouldn‚Äôt rationed. masks mandated school. We're it, although question well kids I'll fitting cloth masks anything. Day 1 - 11 kids quarentined. Day 2 - 25 kids 3 teachers. Day 3 - 45 kids 3 teachers. Today (Sunday) get word aide tested positive whole class quarentined. Another teacher quarentined positive whole staff quarentined. They've masked, day contact without strict social distancing. can't imagine fast turn dumpster fire without masks... Unless contact trace track cases. Thank this. difficult, lonely, simultaneously haven‚Äôt alone three minutes months, people boast online homeschooling / virtual school GREAT little geniuses THRIVED yeah don‚Äôt drink did? Well. wonder anyone ever floated possibility least one major hospital refused accept covid positive patients, vaccinated need medical care get it. that's even plausible thing. Test admittance emergency room. 

The hospitals Washington DC area tried starting fall 2020. Designate hospitals Covid patients non-Covid. end, able concentrate Covid patients certain hospitals, keep hospitals Covid-free.

Testing one problem. Maybe today could give ambulances stack at-home 20 minute rapid tests, option fall winter last year. Plus, ambulance picks patient acute respiratory distress, way help get patient care ER fast possible. can't park somewhere wait test come back, decide hospital drive to. 

Another problem people develop Covid they're admitted. probably already know COVID-19 long incubation time, 10 days. longer someone weak immune system. fact, Covid loves emerge secondary infection patients weakened surgery medical issue. 

So somebody tests negative Covid admission hospital planned heart surgery, tests positive couple days surgery, they're still critical care unit? Moving point incredibly risky. 

So could send planned Covid admissions particular hospitals, even hospitals supposed focus Covid patients still got ER people tested positive admission, even admitted non-Covid medical problem. getting them. annoying take slots away people might actually need find statusb Hopefully so, seems going be. seem adamant two negative tests unfortunately. Maybe change next week. read Live Nation mandating vaccines/tests shows starting early October. happened sooner, better late never guess.

Anyway, anyone know also applies shows sold Ticketmaster?

I understand whether Live Nation books shows sells like TM, I'm hoping policy covers tickets TM too. Specifically System / Faith tour October.

I know brands stuff, sure Live Nation exactly :/ I'm watching show write lol COVID.. IDIOTS CRAVE  Article English can't read - I'm currious got 99% population. getting vaccine required law? 99% volunteering get it? severe restrictions vaccinated? antivaxxers all?

Here Canada we've sitting bit 80% now. can't imagine 1-2% population legitimate medical reason abstaining.  Sure, after:

 - everyone age eligible vaccine opportunity fully vaccinated 
 - immunocompromised received three doses (or ever many determined need) and/or effective potent at-home treatment 
 - solid data PASC rates among breakthrough infections

Until then, fuck risk acceptance. Left USA 1971.  Ahead curve avoiding rush. HISD Houston starts 8/23. people simply deserve compassion. Let Jeebus sort out. buddy australia video messages daily. bored mind due lock downs limitations non essential travel Universal mask mandates K-12 Schools mandated indefinitely. Also, sports School, especially indoor sports, prioritized education. spreading sports class, lot anecdotal evidence area last year, happening. suspend sports 1st, academics. Excelsior Pass simply answers whether vaccinated. answer whether enter restaurants NYC, used one method verify answer.

So created flowchart, would start ""do Excelsior Pass? Y/N"". would lead entry, N would lead options, would also lead entry. one options would cover people cannot vaccinated and/or exempt. 

The Excelsior Pass really simple designed cover edge-cases. answers Y/N whether vaxxed. It‚Äôs possible. would nice little bonus, wouldn‚Äôt it? would say everything problem. though, vaccinations continue rate, early summer next year 70%... I'm afraid cut it... :(  1 50 Texans long covid? source 11-15%? long long term goal population immunity, require 90%+ residents get shot. take decade many first world nations get there, mandates &amp; increased health premiums/surcharges vaxxed we'll get one way another. keep mind took whole generation ppl willing fasten seatbelts started cars.

Until rely vaccines prophylactics, preventing serious disease &amp; symptoms. means US G7 nations keep pumping hundreds millions year R&amp;D newer vaccines remain highly effective. realization ppl take preventative shot, second part covid campaign increasing production &amp; availability therapeutics like Regeneron (the antibody infusion used Donald), well boosting medical staff least 15% keep future surges. looks like rate death fallen lot since last year put ventilator still anywhere 36-44% different studies find. act wear mask. wear mask everyone vulnerable. I'm vaccinated, got 2 months maskless, I'm back wear one selfish people can't get vaccine. happy wear mask wearing bothered physically, happy felt like finally tackling horrible virus end might sight soon, wear mask day long felt like achievement fot right thing. feels like huge kick balls. 

It's wear mask, why. people actively holding us back, pretending they're victims. Since people tip anyone servers? regularly tip kitchen staff restaurant McDonald's worker? case you‚Äôre curious, technically vaccines don‚Äôt stop getting infected. idea behind vaccine introduces dead variant body learn remove. new vaccine little different doesn‚Äôt use dead variant mRNA. Regardless idea same, get infected actual COVID body fights much faster efficiently usually point don‚Äôt receive symptoms. actually offering guns prize one state think. needs stimulus check given vaccinated though. There‚Äôs reason reactions like these. don‚Äôt get it. 100% Cops like bossing people around, deal this. compensation call antiva That‚Äôs going great business.

Except law government says wear pants. vaccinated rapid delta spread shift pandemic endemic seasonal patterns less case surge behavior....like cold flu season good news FL .gov reporting ??? ...and school start again? wee ones spread cooties like crazy...  Sinovac using Chile Hungary seem delta trouble. win inactivated virus vaccines?  herd immunity impossibility Good point illiteracy worth try. dumb take. It‚Äôs fault energy drinks guilty pleasure? 

I‚Äôm sure don‚Äôt consume anything unhealthy. /s think missing point high percentage people 60 Israel vaccinated. ~99% claim disease prevention still correct (although think lower Delta?).

99% disease prevention mean 99% serious cases hospital unvaccinated. take consideration portion population vaccinated. 95% people vaccinated means 250 serious cases come 95% population 150 cases come 5% population.
Clearly odds serious case much higher unvaccinated individuals way vaccinated people.

It doesn‚Äôt seem like anyone ‚Äúwrong‚Äù here. complete misunderstanding statistics. Voting restrictions redistricting.. safe would sleep small ish hotel room weekend 5 fully vaccinated people Massachusetts? Debating canceling vacation plans. ICU filled problem needs solved local community. People south refuse get vaccinated concern northeast.  Bart: worst retention rate history.

Homer: Worst retention rate history *...so far.* Well, might point trials run rigor FDA/EMA would require. inactivated vaccines old, old tech whose known risk giving disease inactivated correctly (which countries notice, China sure hell would).

I'm confused three positive samples deer January 2020 bigger deal. 

It seems common knowledge covid-19 prevalent US March 2020 that's still standard narrative. understand recommend annual flu shots. flu always changing new shot year basically software update immune system keep date possible flu circulating. wonder we‚Äôll see combo vaccine Covid flu fall.  Damn, know anymore Japan thing but... keep repeating comments! kind oil buy like... $6 gives coat makes fog anymore all! apply every days works!

There must equivalent countries...

I mean, thing even hold decently 33C(92F), hot rainy Osaka day, running rain. time notice sliiiightly (I mean, literally worst case scenario guess hahah)

Anyways, look amazon something, one thing upset wearing mask. thought general knowledge now!  basic level, think like rule says wear pants. entirety pandemic, low wage service workers people tasked enforcing them. people fucked hard entire time. one gives shit. enrages me.

They essentially deputized essential workers, gave authority actually enforce it. trials incidence curves (by day symptom onset) diverged around day 11. yes, basically. mRNA fast act. Yes agree. least person voting. Yes make myocaridtis serious symptom. said people get vaccinated well informed potential (very rare risk).

Once myocarditis that's pretty serious condition that's talking about, general risk Pfizer/Moderna vaccine. comment made sound like basically attributable lifting/caffeine neither would cause heart issues healthy 16 year old clear statistical evidence mRNA vaccines covid cause myocarditis point ""almost always"" much risk many parents/families alleviating risk comes number positive benefits listed above. way, is. 

Unfortunately, many people use excuse tip. serves purpose exploit vulnerable workers. 

Yes, system broken unfair. vehemently tipping, either work hard change system stop participating.   know vaccines aren‚Äôt 100%, really hoped would prevent long Covid. Hopefully get research this. risk UK low enough go schedule worry much. super low risk single dose age &lt;25, like 95% 40 immune societal risk catching also low.

How come conclusion? data needed collected.. CDC track breakthrough cases result hospitalization. Uh ya did. live here. slowly opened people wore masks. Texas wasnt even top 20 deaths per Capita last year. WTH talking about? could said patrons. dont like it, go elsewhere. That's really good point.

Does Florida track number discharged patients?

Knowing hospitalization fatality rate (death/(death+discharged)) time would interesting.

Given average age hospitalized patients getting younger, doctors knowing better treat patients, people vaccinated (less severe cases), hospitalized fatality rate dropping time.

However, fatality rate rising instead, sign hospitals likely resource strapped either admitting sicker patients quality care dropping due staff equipment shortages. wonder can‚Äôt find people hire minimum wage. read article DW today anti-vax people Germany.

Covid 2% death rate, that's low. 

0.003% definitely miniscule number, low.  also evidence mask actually harm, many professions wearing masks centuries. pandemic straight fact points masks reduce transmission deadly disease. pandemic speculation ‚Äúmasks cause harm‚Äù without evidence helping anyone. Hospitalizations lag bit. You‚Äôll see start dip soon. Infection rate started dip well.

Just like UK, masks restrictions play smaller role think. newer data UK may showing lower efficacy Pfizer, particularly due waning immunity possibly. flipside, J&amp;J may end getting stronger time (at least 8 months know far). may well see pros cons different vaccines longer periods time like 6+ months. almost looks like Mrna vaccines better first 6 months, adenovirus vectors longer lasting/increase time. think really need putting lot effort researching heterologous vaccination. entirety pandemic, low wage service workers people tasked enforcing them.

In addition tests uncomfortable, invasive potentially expensive, meaning people want get done concert, people know false positives that's fear well. Imagine missing favorite artist incorrect test.

All aside, yes, people infected end slipping cracks fewer instances this. current system, 100 infected people go show, spread throughout venue spread virus everywhere. new system means maybe 10 100 would get through, less likelihood someone comes contact them.

 also vaccinated people vaccinated people infected, less likely unvaccinated people, although certainly impossible.

So what? People bother getting vaccinated need isolated COVID eradicated? that's alternative people offering. Agree. surprised high fully vaxxed numbers are. population skewed older suspect that's why. 

It sounds rough are! Hang there. healthcare. far studies read Delta variant shows amount virus whether vaccinated not

So, point, reading stuff correctly. Even linked article citing ""breakthrough cases"".

I still decided tbh. Waiting see goes person universities starting decide  three different schools last year. Three one day. Exposing three communities kids, exposing two schools kids me. Masks mandated, sure. constant thought ‚ÄúAm risk? bring home family? kids get sick me?‚Äù

I taught PE. Kids running around masks, often masks slipped pulled themselves. must‚Äôve told kids slide mask ten thousand times. Probably more.

Now, government taken pandemic decisions away school boards. masks next year. I‚Äôm sure wear them, man. They‚Äôve promised return normal. wonder long normal last. blame Houston Harris County leaders collapse TX medical center. serve two purposes. Shift blame away office demonize Democrat leaders, play well conservative base. That's ultimately end game, pandering conservative base. backtracks now, say ""betrayed"" them. hold course hope death rates remain low enough base continue dismiss ""people die every day, what's big deal"". Currently Covid killed approximately 1 every 500 Texas residents. guess Abbott math decided could write number supporters need be. I'll sum nutshell.

Vaccinated people still carry, get pass virus others. OP point, really makes sense, whatever.

And I'm Vaccinated. bias me. stating facts. # W !  NYC Residents would patronizing businesses ones who'd causing problems, they're far mask vaccine friendly even across River Northern NJ. 

It would tourists visitors parts country acclimated lenient/ careless approaches pandemic would likely causing problems. new requirement ‚Äî called Key NYC ‚Äî includes bars, fitness gyms, movie stage theatres, museums indoor venues. **Staff locations also required vaccinated**. confirm. Currently Covid, even though I'm fully vaxxed got all-vaxxed wedding. 

This stop/slow spread, prevent hospitalizations.  Thanks feedback. 

I guess I'm trying say HIGH risk vs less risk. Currently 2.4% hospitalizations amoung 17 younger. Thats despite 22% population roughly 10% vaccination rate. Minors fare even better death rate. 

Bottom line, adults half vaccinated hospitalized 10x more. suggests 95% less risky minors.  means high risk. 

That said. mask school?  Absolutely! 

I agree closing schools down.  Mitigate risk masking, testing, ventilation, distancing etc. Let's use logic hyperbole please.  population level, models factor 20-30% reduced spread universal masking, pre-Delta. effectiveness vaccines 95% could say masks superfluous. 70% vaccine effectiveness Delta, masks help still much weaker tool. Vaccines change trajectory. that's fine, pretend harming anyone logical. (potentially) harming people, people care about. cult. good friend mine (49) enlarged heart inflamed valve due long haul Covid. ‚ÄúTo protect around you, urge everyone ‚Äî vaccinated unvaccinated ‚Äî continue preventive measures, including social distancing indoor mask wearing,‚Äù researchers wrote Friday‚Äôs report.

Oh agree I'm Northern NJ know far mask vax friendly many parts nation, probably hit terrifying first wave virus shit traumatic. 

I'm speaking experiences NJ, people done masks soon mask mandate lifted, especially outdoor settings. Whereas NYC, i've noticed people masking outdoors literally everywhere else day. point pandemic calm down. would superintendent continue serve community knowing people behaved way. supposed shake hands threatened forget it? going long term social effects long medical problems settle down.  seems wishful response, think kind precedent would go well.

Now, set extra emergency triage tenting times crises, triage process never discriminated based something like vax status, medical nature cases. 

Do wish could? Sure, seems vastly unfair people take resources. ethical grounds medicine built upon, either. *finger strut* Currently going college. show vaccine card. beholden donors, insist business usual.

The anti-intellectual movement favor feel real getting worse. real irony science technology employ (yet understand) spread misinformation, either useful idiot, malevolent PR disseminator lies conflict interest. let dumb ass ducks die ignorance. Fuck em Remember took mask mandates shutting economy flatten curve?  What‚Äôs new plan flatten curve? totally different things. nipples kill grandma. going anyway. Anti-Vax individuals aren‚Äôt making rational decisions, let‚Äôs expect change time soon. $40k masters degree! live expensive city, too. Teachers undervalued here. didn‚Äôt need health insurance, would‚Äôve quit last year. It‚Äôs absolute horror. Especially witnessing adults care children live die. I‚Äôm done anti-maskers anti-vaxxers could scream years!  Can't office held liable endangering teachers students, lots solid evidence masks work could proven, understand least attempted. Talking preventable? Kids aren‚Äôt even eligible vaxxed people still pass on. Lung cancer smoking, lot obesity also preventable. People make choices. infectious gets, likely run hosts burn absolutely politicized virus weeks. pretended like big deal, even massive feasts, right couldn‚Äôt avoid longer.

That would Spring Festival season entire country travels continent families.

It's causes epidemic became rampant fast.

I traveled across China go home UK Spring Festival holiday. 20 hours UK 36 hours return.

There way stop spread holiday. Go ahead, try control tens millions moving around country petrie dish fuselages. Try. said God came told people wear masks. devil come form COVID god says way protect satan wear mask. kids aren‚Äôt alright. ignorant lunatics. delta variant avoid vaccines. increase breakthrough symptomatic cases due higher viral load. Getting third booster shot current vaccines advantageous since antibodies means protection greater viral loads. Thank great response Headline says, ""...Blacks, Hispanics, women young children..."" chill. race competition.  Many people sub fall prey confirmation bias makes ignore certain facts fact vaccine hesitancy isn‚Äôt present white communities it‚Äôs actually huge problem across different racial groups people don‚Äôt want talk goes narrative. Many minorities country don‚Äôt trust government (for good reason) huge factor many people aren‚Äôt getting vaccinated. Instead trying make political addressing fears trying comfort people getting vaccine. Fuck culture war bullshit. OH SHIT SON!!!!!! ""Common enemy,"" lol. ship sailed 30 years ago. Poe's law strikes Nonsense. \*barely\* conversation. I've spreading word ventilation forever greeted hostility disbelief astonishing number people new information therefore supposedly part ""do research"" conspiracy crowd. Truly informed people know. That's people.

The ignoring year help, either. P r e c h!!  extroverts. Everyone know, including myself, pretty upset starting pick lives back we've cast right back abyss knowing hell happening, risk is, it'll end, etc. office opened like 3 weeks closed again. 

In terms mentality, worse ever before. We're damn place. businesses require masks, don't. people still following guidelines, others acting like ended 6 months ago. Leadership media focused part. updates CDC, Fauci never really says anything, etc. Zero plan action kind dealing this. Zero information updates potential Delta vaccine, booster shots, etc. like we're collectively closing eyes hoping it'll go away. really, hopefully will. ""went away"" India without really anything drastic. saw first hand. Next age group probably 5 up. I‚Äôll honest seems media thing waaaaaaay going life thing. I‚Äôm late 20s major city. friend group pretty mixed racially, nurse people different backgrounds everywhere. Race never seems come person.

 honestly feels like big disconnect watching news. You‚Äôd think race war erupt. Maybe I‚Äôm weirdly bubble? Idk find race obsession really reflect people act day day life wow, certainy Travelers get last choice floated first sure do. 


We talking ventilation year ago. information then. could conversation. Anything detracted ""masks good"" shut down. like insanity.  mean technically it‚Äôs worst day. Last year Australia 60+ deaths one day. Hi us are. 5 children thus far Mississippi since new variant. One many preventable. libruls takin' muh breathin' freedoms! Here, help bring welcome. 


I understand line people trying walk. one hand, saying bad kids *might* actually get people take little seriously, good thing. hand, means people prone overreacting (like sub) get indignant fact schools still open- virtually pediatricians believe kids go *third* year remote learning. definitely tough. 


Too bad can't get people care adults killing since beginning, systems completely overwhelmed. Fuck yeah! Could Feds withhold federal funds state? sad reality people would instead believe politician knowledge vaccines. Instead someone actually learned knows behind it.

It‚Äôs like asking politician perform surgery don‚Äôt trust surgeon. depends town/region. towns like Newton (mostly wealth and/or older towns) 90%+ fully vaccinated rate eligible people. towns, closer 30%.  #1 based fact Wuhan wet markets known sell bats candidate animals, need lots repeated contact bats virus jump humans would bat survey/lab worker. Bat survey/lab worker likely scenario looked since actual testing candidate intermediate hosts shown permissive infection, fails reveal likely intermediary host. Further, serological wastewater surveys show wet market unlikely source location infection humans. many children died dying recent? Create public health app confirms vaccination status get go movies, restaurants, airports, go work. you‚Äôre vaccinated, hang porch. ICU. solution: stop treating unvaccinated patients prioritize life threatening injuries illnesses Covid-19 related. course, medical professional right mind would say upfront, there's reason waste resources preventable illness cure. kinda need help guys uh I‚Äôve done covid test soon put swab nose nose runny bad day. okay happen? Glad got rid DeVos. know taken step. I‚Äôm pretty sure asplenia would count primary immunodeficiency, check doctor.
[CDC covid booster US, get antibody test neucleocapsid antibodies, them, covid. (but can't tell vaccination) 

If get antibody test Spike antibodies, tell anything.

Make sure get right test. Yes, smell delicious!   can‚Äôt accept risk till kid gets vaccine. Nope Many are. pay ""traveling"" much extra fill otherwise. blame white people gonna miss starts regaining taste. comes back everything apparently tastes smells like literal pickled rotten shit. actually care people dying around world, ones dying sweatshops. Got it. See, start. Uniting everyone common enemy. happens local authorities simply ignore supreme court? many variables, like doing? orgy? Sitting outside park? Wearing masks? Hanging 5 minutes 50 minutes?

We can't possibly tell much risk every single instance day. impossible also really unnecessary. Read virus spread assess tolerance risk. might worth around people, maybe realize risk worth benefits. unvaccinated family that's one thing, unvaccinated strangers could another.  heard Florida gators job free. I‚Äôm skeptical too, ability enter words long, covid studies search engine. 

I‚Äôm also skeptical actually skeptical. 

Sounds like made assumption didn‚Äôt want seek information might challenge assumption. True skeptics don‚Äôt mind proven wrong. CLOSE approved *why delay school is?* distance learning then?? humans work way. aware risk low would feel like shit take basic precautions, son got covid got seriously sick. 

So take precautions including going shopping, dining in, making sure masked close areas nowadays playgrounds playing unrelated kids.

So restaurants open much want, malls open much want. going to. take plane ride though month, realize high risk can't much it.

Essentially preventing risk necessary. TAMPA, Fla. ‚Äî Baycare Health Systems hospitals Pinellas, Pasco, Polk county put elective procedures pause, effective Saturday, Aug. 14. Hillsborough County Baycare Hospitals stopped performing elective procedures earlier month. reason? rise COVID-19 hospitalization last 6 weeks.  felt like crying day first one. made eyes sleepy dry. second one knocked ass hour stuck around days. wasn‚Äôt bad. felt like really bad hangover. GOP trying kill children? trying kill citizens United States? fuck wrong them? Iowa state fair on. one big. Even draws tourists. know consequences soon.  Administrators sole reason nursing shortage. They‚Äôve always run skeleton crews worked us bare-bones

While absolutely true, originate middle management. ""Lean staffing"" decisions come top company, like everywhere, every industry.  Florida counted non residents vaccination numbers, people flocking Florida get vaccinated. number likely less currently state. matter far less cases north fall.  curious well. That's teacher determine risk level. I'm young, healthy, vaccinated wearing mask I'm perfectly fine teaching person think either examples serious issue.

Binge drinking always bad you, may may serious problem. Many people binge drink go many days weeks without drinking, addiction.

The dangerous thing drinking many drinks every day. clear addiction consumption enough alcohol always impact physical mental health.  wonder it‚Äôs hard find employees? Even wanted can‚Äôt get full time job right odds kids going online learning within month starting school. partly supply issue longer wait meant people could get first shots partly preliminary evidence suggesting longer gap yields robust immune response (although downside leaves people fully protected longer). No, 11 9 statistics misleading. better question, matter? see absolute increase 100 cardiac events vaccinating, say 4 million people (roughly 50%) population leads 0.025% chance cardiac side effects vaccine.

Honestly, that's fantastic. nothing debunk. vaccine drug 100% safe. Side effects always present. matter degree severity.

Ask this, vaccine campaign happened, look Florida. 1,500 dead weekend averaging 600+ day, one week would see deaths covid year added cardiac events. Keep mind study mention deaths.

Also keep mind population studied listed. incident rate cardiac issues begin with? would agreee Plague enthusiasts. yet see data would surprised like 4 1 5 1. Kids back school now. may see one burst levels off.  happens politicians think sell reality simply exist. They're basically daring sue knowing I'm state single person likely won't.

Would need prove standing sue? mean... not. see listed theoretical budget reconciliation bill would need wait least next year  Additionally, asked clarification beforehand general counsel Tennessee's Health Department reached Governor's office beforehand actually presence mind consider potential blowback beforehand, conveniently dumped state Department Health needed scapegoat placate angry opposition vaccine. Pregnant women vaxxed ! I‚Äôve travelled Brazil work get several vaccines order obtain visa, exceptions. ( vaccines tropical diseases, since I‚Äôm Canadian, part standard vaccinations here.) Sounds like America longer world leader. Instead pity-stock Well needs change then. pronto. That's we're talking here. pandemic wine mom memes flowing hard last year. It‚Äôs funny anymore (or ever). Yeah that‚Äôs still pride friend. 

Pride concise way saying they‚Äôre prideful put million dollar payouts via lobbying corporate gigs (children family members well keep government corporations nepotistic) things mentioned put payouts good use. whatever works make sure people trained moved fields relevant progression society. Wow, system designed benefit wealthy corporations failing general populace can‚Äôt afford proper medical care, lot cases, even better themselves? Color shocked! first kicked discounts smoking 7 8 years ago, price non-smokers change. 'discount' simply brought us back paying previous year. smokers got increase, essentially.

With said, smoker thing, 100% honor system, one right mind said smoker. Hopefully vaccination status honor system too. office currently holding documents ""legal review""? Since February? Go look yourself. It‚Äôs cities website still got SinoVax 5GE. cells hero, antibodies are. see reinfections infections vaccination fairly severe relative initial (which clearly good news), antibodies prevent infections completely excellent clip. real kicker. thing Texas Cruz‚Äôs kids St. John‚Äôs. Disgusting zero compassion unmasked unvaxxed adults. 100% compassion kids kids go school them. Chile.  really blows kids easily able virtual learning ones approved vaccine. Came say this.

First thought: ""there's health care system?"" get numbers covid kids? likely hospitalized and/or dying?? There‚Äôs already 99% survival rate general population know fewer kids get adults Well, there's reason clinical trials; know certain yet.

However, given we've seen 1. Moderna seems perform better Pfizer Delta, much higher dose, 2. UK demonstrated longer time vaccine doses leads higher level immunity, chances good third mRNA dose would substantially improve protection.

This said, public health standpoint, would much better put 3rd dose unvaccinated person. extra community protection would effective keeping people safe, especially globally speaking vaccines short supply.

But individual perspective, *can* get 3rd dose, *can't* much get dose US anti-vaxxer someone low-vaccination country. individual standpoint makes sense. particular unvaccinated going LBJ almost certainly poor lack health insurance. That‚Äôs hospital‚Äôs target demographic. put right original comment.  bit worse cold? serious? Current global deaths Covid 4.3 million true number probably least double that. 

Did miss news millions deaths cold? know, indulging crazy ideas lead one antivaxxer basically intellectual smoking, antivaxxers another type smoker now. FIFY. Yeah law system make sense Admitting covid hoax deathbed would mean tacitly admitting killed themselves. powerful psychological motivator deny further. Thanks vaccine case Pfizer. fun! Halloween?

EDIT: censor mod Also Abbott Texas. contest best US dictator CDC said go ahead take masks. point idk thing turning zombie plague would help. much previous surges differ regionally?

As recall summer 2020 pandemic surge heavily concentrated southern states. recall important regionalism winter wave, pre-vaccine.

If northeast better too, there's probably good argument northeast fare better well.

I'm guessing referring 'state-based health care exchanges'. Strike. 

We talking health well children, staff well.
People Texas need speak protest crazy ruling.
Or majority Texans okay kids getting sick school? logic smoker preexisting condition able either. also nurses getting covid. $10k per week? $520k / year?! (Obviously don‚Äôt work weeks)

That‚Äôs lot pay much winning backs kids losing.   Thanks, interesting. Aside risk disease everyone involved, many/all people bankrupted political choice. Aside rare breakthrough catastrophes, could mostly avoided others vaccinated.

Very sad stuff. Alabama: ""We're drowning, please help us!""

Chinese vaccines seem work real problem.  

I saw somebody r/nursing quit job saying ""I took job help community realize community worth helping"". lived experience thousands. Take look r/covidlonghaulers read stories. Since doctors understand post viral syndromes (because they‚Äôre woefully underfunded since they‚Äôre hard measure years it‚Äôs assumed patients ‚Äúmaking up‚Äù truly baffling sad) dismiss patient test results show ‚Äúfine‚Äù It‚Äôs legal whatsoever Musikfest, school starts 23rd district we're still fighting fully masked k-6 classes. 

First masks. Then, parent uproar, changed masked mask optional classes. another school board meeting tomorrow hopefully get whole k-6 masked... 

We known spread schools last year. kindergartener virtual first semester sent back in-person winter break well district keeping safe single cold whole spring semester! 

Masks work wish anti-mask parents could look success last year let things younger kids get vaccinated. like Delta. mantra family is, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt go cleaning gutters right now!‚Äù air ambulance service fly patients dedicated planes helicopters. service area [these several types helicopter, Pilatus PC-12 turboprop plane, Learjet 31A business jet. Since aircraft contracted aviation companies fly air ambulance services, I'm going assume probably typical models airplane purpose.

As /u/Goofygrrl notes, planes land airport logistical disadvantage. However, planes fly faster longer range helicopters there's tradeoff. example, one ALNW's says Pilatus flies 292 MPH range 800 miles, Learjet flies 500 MPH range 1380 miles. helicopters fly 150 MPH range 150 miles. (They also note Pilatus preferred flying smaller airports, bet ""is airport's runway long enough land jet"" yet another factor must considered.)

In addition straining logistics, stuff cheap. getting one-person charter flight mobile ICU ""flight attendants"" highly-skilled nurses.... fixed domicile, move around. travel gf. Canada still home work Canadian company. things. Yup, they're locked in. Pfizer widely applied Brazil too, mate. got mine last wednesday. Actually, sinovac vaccine makes less 30% vaccinated home state. realize covid male! Blake: weekend, saw faster usual fall rate hospitalization (heading towards 1.1 rate) case spread rate (heading towards 1.2 rate). trend continued rate, metrics would hit peaks week. Let's hope holds. Many people symptoms completely recover short time frame. man already won. knew going able stop made big stink Brag constituents everything could stop mask mandates get white house  Oh, yeah, saying that, 100% agree you. Japan even start vaccinating general population July, embarrassing. 

I talking highest number infections increasing chances dangerous mutations occur. actually surprised see vaccination rates disproportional democrats republicans, obviously there's still significant difference. get caught making issues/topics political political. Fascinating! Actually long covid called affects 30% get COVID. Maybe it. interesting find me:  Hillary Clinton George Soros would team tape antivax PSA (live Portland), we'll herd immunity six weeks.

I think see uptick vaccination fall people start returning work, employers schools start requiring them.

For town Ottawa, federal mandate going big impact, think. still rumpling vaccine pass think Doug Ford choice put one place. maybe one feds implement travelling used. Either way, see businesses start ask one, even mandated provincial government.

All drive vaccination rate. do! wear 24/7!

It terrible first weeks just... bought thing made go away. Even hot terribly humid Japan works perfectly.

I also beard mask makes humidity issue inside mask worse, fixed it.

I'd rather cursed website cursed state. born raised small town Mississippi, never go back. 1) stuff shut last summer. Sure plenty people whatever wanted got together maskless, also fewer events restaurants/businesses congregate at. Less travel too. 
2) *Delta*. extra contagiousness joke. saw summer look like even better version last summer May/June Delta took hold. couple counties scrape 60%. high rate. squash pandemic vaccinating world.

I‚Äôm def younger, teeming natural antibodies. *Excluding Nickleback events.  genuinely interested would found information weeks ago. Check CDC website. Read local news local hospitalization information. Look strong science based websites find resources.

The general takeaway find last weeks almost 100% hospitalizations unvaccinated people, younger people getting sick pediatric ICUs full. longer old and/or people existing conditions. son speech delay well. Without presence autism. heard form parents believe pandemic caused speech delay children. But, don‚Äôt know bribe anymore. speech therapy twice month via telehealth, think might slowly helping? seeing data stating this? ""Clear"" digital immunization record works really well. sure would work since mine done Walgreens pretty early on. able find records confirm within hour so. app phone shows photo vaccine dates doses confirm telling truth. Decent system. used live events travel (like Hawaii.) reason spread fast SARS-COV2 SARS MERS replicate lower respiratory tract, makes harder pass another person, whereas SARS-COV2 replicates upper respiratory tract. honestly people really risking hurting unvaccinated people attend live group events.

Darwinism reduce pool people willing hire increase competitive advantage willing to. There's already lot competition right entry-level labor employers struggling fill open positions. definitely see companies making calculation cheaper mandate, especially states half labor market unvaccinated. trust 99% data either, living slums issue here. live close one work close another, vaccination posts right across street forming lines everyday. people taking crowded buses/trains everyday go work, wanna safe people medical exceptions *entire population 12* ineligible get vaccinated. Forget Sao Paulo, could list 100 reasons 99.2% vaccination rate among adults possible city planet. insane others believe number without critical thinking. Thank you! Thats I'm for. like dramatize pandemic 4 years need. give DeSantis credit, whole ruin data made harder follow. deaths appear skyhigh google(via new york times) worldometers seems deaths going down, can't see got 1000 numbers. Florida got new death record know weekend... realtime shock value over... Floridian Governor may successfully killed climax. get high data manipulation can't hide it?

Some realized going mass floridian acceptance finally. vaccination rate went little bit guess went back down. Maybe statewide official got died, would get serious significant more, would cement thought vaccine work.

Pro-vax / ending masks. increase breakthrough symptomatic cases due higher viral load. 

This partially true, think Delta may associated faster reproduction, also fact intramuscular vaccines (all current Covid-19 vaccines) elicit high mucosal immunity. virus may start reproduce upper airways, soon immune system figures what's going fight infection. faster reproduction rate may likely notice this, OG Covid body probably fighting chance anything all. 'breakthrough' infection bad term mild / asymptomatic infections vaccinated individuals - protection 'lives' bloodstream nose throat, needs woken thing, still remarkably well current variants. disagree. Banishing people legit medical reason can't receive vaccines answer.

The answer us safely receive vaccines get them, creating herd immunity reducing likelihood unvaxxed person ever encounters various diseases vaccines.

The willfully anti-vax crowd problem, tiny percentage population severe allergies shots. That‚Äôs good question, I‚Äôd love know answer this. One reasons Census many people lives S√£o Paulo updated. also reason cities Brazil data saying 101% elderies vaccinated.

Example random numbers:
- Census says there's 10M adults living city
- 9.9M adults vaccinated, accordingly Census 99% adults
- reality there's 11M adults living city, 90% adults vaccinated Wasn‚Äôt Lol made laugh pretty hard, different comment others. I'll support movement! Important information removed ""low quality"". I'm still undecided I'm going kids state world definitely top list reasons any. Hateful stupidity knows bounds. Human species doomed. Can't even wear simple mask get vaccine protect others, imagine whole climate change we're going through...yeah kiss saving planet goodbye. long easy way prove shot in. concern vaccine mandates prove it, especially people move state state. card proof enough it. would hate see person excluded society right thing due able verify idenity app. need federal funding state DMVs get something put DL state ID even passports. take European approach also allowing negative tests proof natural immunity? seems lot logical. makes sense demographic likely worked service jobs deal nasty fucking public shit wages benefits. They've taken information department health website, time hit new high hospitalizations (maybe last Wednesday?). We've opened tent hospital Samaritan's Purse opening another. Last heard, zero ICU beds available reason think situation changed. We've 20000 cases last 6 days consistent 7% convert hospitalizations, add fresh 1400 1500 already had. problem case counts comparing back still great idea actual case counts. know many we're missing now, decent amount anyone mild symptoms vaxxed typically going test. back peak, enough tests. back us looking unreliable figures many variables allow us correlate/compare numbers level meaningful certainty. That's always important opinion focus numbers actually definitively provable - hospitalizations. Even death counts underestimated throughout pandemic consensus seeming missed around half deaths. 

Bottom line - want know serious area, pay attention hospitalizations. also number really matters vaxxed. mean trauma/illness want know bed somewhere. States like - VT case NJ mine leave us little worry regard. right - checked, today. Yes Well, still catch COVID even vax‚Äôd. vax protects dying becoming seriously ill requiring hospitalization. get infected still need sick fully recover, contribute staff shortage. city somewhere planet gave $1000 every vaccinated adult, even would reach 99% vaccination rate.

I've required show immunization records past, medical exception process. New York this?

I've never exception - thankfully negative reactions standard vaccines I've gotten throughout life - I've always noticed exception language forms I've submitted.

Does Excelsior app way indicate medical exception? talks big gets unwashed (literally word them) uneducated masses follow lead like lambs slaughter house.

These politicians anything follow anyone money, power recognition. honestly believe daddy issues, like around, definitely never said proud anything did. Israel starting see vaccinated people hospitalized.

So mostly due math; people vaccinated population (assuming 100% efficacy, vaccine is) , course see people hospital. proof vaccines 'wearing off'. Flu good comparison either, different strains every year whereas Covid-19 variants biochemically/functionally different enough considered new strain. extremely likely people ending hospital would wound hospital got infected months ago (all else equal). I'm sure we'll need boosters point unless immune compromised elderly, people need chill getting them.  bad guy doesn‚Äôt mean ‚Äúbad guy‚Äù among doctors, lower 50% nurses. service industry? I‚Äôve heard wild shit. I‚Äôd agree overwhelmingly NYers respect covid restrictions, also craziest mfs earth running around. think important quantify long-term symptoms are.

Are lingering loss smell/taste, severe long-covid symptoms? It‚Äôs similar cult. dividing bubbles information communication. share screenshots memes stupid ‚Äúothers‚Äù are. completely unable communicate outsiders. personally think CDC come stated ""Once state reaches 70% vaccination, research indicates mask mandates eliminated"" tied loosening restrictions vaccination rates. would gotten many people fence sooner, IMHO, got done. Instead, soon mask mandates ""went away"" vaccinated, sure seemed go away ""everyone"". face seal masks important air emergencies CA.

Associates degree plus clinicals state board licensing tests. also need continuing education credits every 2 years renew licenses, licensed separately state work in. associates degree. someone anaphylaxis myocarditis response first shot (and therefore contraindication get 2nd), think negative covid test within 48 hours sufficient substitute. opinion though. two kids. glad do, amazing, light life. also deeply mourn later life look like, spend lot time resources trying prepare make things marginally better them, utterly useless.

I hate age, basically living dystopian novel. primarily difference public image. Downtown Portland windows boarded last year frequent protests/riots, average lower violent crime rates places TX. Portland news time portrayed liberal hellhole failure, time better average.  granddaughter CNA. makes 12 hour. Psychology always complicated. true. Nope. mandate NOLA goes effect Aug. 23. Second week september month away. UK's numbers anything go hopefully peak well Unclear. It‚Äôs probably range, less range original results Pfizer trials. freshly vaccinated person close immune delta freshly vaccinated person alpha January. Thanks clearing up! like it, move Context knowledge, evidence. Shielding vaccine liability thing since 42 USC Code 300aa-22 enacted 1988 - idk bringing Biden. 

If you‚Äôre talking covid vaccine specifically, immunity comes PREP act passed 2020 - Trump - again, bringing Biden seems like agenda here. 

It topic complex history, lots people bring shielding liability, fewer bring fact US government specifically set aside funds compensate people verified injuries. Legal liability complex you‚Äôre manufacturing something mandated GOVERNMENT, liability would fall said government, manufacturer. 

But you‚Äôre ‚Äújust saying facts‚Äù, right? Yeah that's me, i'm higher risk lol i've trying find balance getting hard i'm looking getting booster dose we'll see primitive understand Pfizer &amp; Moderna effective Delta, Moderna effective longer period time. could definitely wrong though. hope case, counter states right now. Absolutely not. completely mess positivity rate data, plus waste resources. get tested unvaccinated and/or show symptoms COVID-19. it‚Äôs problem anyway, it? Submitting booster data absolutely nothing pediatric approval. resources taken pediatric research nothing booster research influencing pediatric approval timelines. no. That's *PART* jobs. Make they're always it, fully vaccinated workers get better parts. point, plan working home greatest extent possible masking go public, otherwise living life before. I‚Äôm planning trip Paris October, I‚Äôll masked planes trains, museums, pretty much every indoor space visit, restaurants I‚Äôll try get food go eat outdoors, rather de-mask eat inside.

Ideally we'd require vaccination negative test. scale testing infrastructure moon.

That would tank numbers pretty quickly keep low. 

The stupid thing is: money/resources actually implement this. purely politics. could easily scale quick testing infrastructure everywhere. would actually cheaper fighting covid hospitals.

As long people spreading it, going spread that's bad thing. Mutations real, theory evolution practice crazy fast timeline. There's reason people like Fauci concerned mutations right now.

This move right direction, enough. make testing routine thing like grocery shopping getting gas people. routine twice week. Joe Rogan fan news Unfortunately unvaccinated know don‚Äôt think like you. want reap benefits rest us sacrificed past 18 months. latest news think you‚Äôre referring Mayo Clinic study found Pfizer less efficacious moderna preventing infection (that‚Äôs infections, disease severe disease). numerous confounding factors like Pfizer rolled first elderly at-risk people got cvs Walgreens used nursing homes early on. But, personally think we‚Äôre seeing (also Israel)is Pfizer-elicited antibodies (which keep getting infected first place) waning bit quicker moderna. Could moderna‚Äôs higher dose, could slightly longer moderna interval‚Ä¶or could even true something whacky data.

The important points remain highly effective severe disease, hospitalizations, deaths. Boosters going getting antibodies back mitigate spread infections going winter protect at-risk people.

2. physical test showed extremely low levels Vitamin (2 weeks post covid) attribute severity case + 104 degree fever 4 days.

NOLA fucking dope tho curious; what's efficacy Pfizer Delta antibodies wane? (also, graphs something documenting waning time?)

Is 88% right? (source: People ideological reason supporting opposing specific measures still valid concerns emergency measures become entrenched American society. Things meant means end typically become ends due polarization culture. non ideological position define goal, test well various strategies meet goal, implement effective strategies. However, already seen decent Heuristics used reasoned objective analysis. 

Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions differing levels effectiveness individual population level. Ignoring cumulative effects groups causes people make bad decisions based NPI efficacy rates two given individuals. good evidence masks effective blocking transmission two individuals passing interaction indoors. peer reviewed studies seem fall range 10-75% efficacy particles range aerosols COVID-19 transmitted by, depending mask fit material. would expect, lose fitting cloth masks trend towards bottom high quality masks top range.

However, even smart people bad probabilities, improperly extend number general level protection large group scenarios. great formula help explain created National Academy Science, estimated reduced following factor (1 ‚àí epm)¬≤ , e efficacy of trapping viral particles inside mask, pm percentage population wears masks. look scenario like healthcare, high compliance (95%) good masks (75%), reduce 10x. However, say, grocery store, 50% compliance, 20% cloth mask efficacy, everyone equally likely transmit, reduce 19%. fact even worse that, venn diagram vaccination mask compliance. able say, get 80% vaccinated wear cloth mask, would 30% reduction transmission group, group contributing 10-15% transmission, unfortunately effect may minimal. 

This vast majority studies look mask efficacy recommend measures addition masks reduce spread virus. let people mix, revert mean adherence, certain threshold reduces benefit exponentially. 

The entire point say, point view already passed point pandemic control measures measures appropriate circumstances achieve specified goal, ideological crusade. High quality masks great way protect individual getting sick secondary precaution, vaccination effective specific circumstance. not, however, work miracles, especially compliance low, measures observed, masks low quality, current strain producing higher viral loads. live nothing culture, masks either tyranny, efficacy infallible. worry emergency protocols becoming permanent, already passed point willing treat NPI's respect efficacy, instead made group conformity. Shutting person dining putting capacity limits place sexy, harder make ideological statement, considered.

Edit: forgot word shocked this?  Wasn‚Äôt latest news didn‚Äôt work well delta? moderna effective? Sorry I‚Äôm wrong thought read somewhere. 100% this.  really understand asking. whole point keep unvaxxed public establishments, infect unvaxxed folks well vaxxed people well.

100% logical, we're living time people give fuck logic conflicts personal conveniences. didn‚Äôt say anything contrary? said COULD still get it. authorization third dose original. Pfizer moderna indicated believe boosters original formula enough handle delta.

They create new variant specific vaccine day two need to. it‚Äôs fda determine much data need it. Previously guidance Fda gave indicated would handle like flu shot, meaning little trials would needed, likely info showing boosts antibody titers. guy Reddit making ballpark guess, would bet dire situation could go developing booster putting arms at-risk people 4-8 weeks. hardest part would production. problem. I‚Äôve also noticed throughout pandemic people drop guards much less cautious social distancing family. I‚Äôve dodge quite hugs kisses pandemic, people seem think family bond protect virus. Also, don‚Äôt know details wedding particular, even vaccinations required adult guests, children attended definitely unvaccinated. know still tons research delta breakthrough cases I‚Äôve read, it‚Äôs unlikely transmit vaccinated person vaccinated person. It‚Äôs unvaccinated person transmits vaccinated person transmits unvaccinated person. 
This article pretty interesting. expensive messy too.  They'll lie say first one Honestly, learn surf without cookies. enable cookies sites login trust, typically online retailers such. 

Every site breaks without cookies, use watch video would know half population one dose, 3 million people doses vaccine using. makes vaccination right similar southern part United States.  apparently friend can't read what's posted covid site news station year Pretty sure that‚Äôs part joke (at least think so!) limiting spread. less likely contract virus vaccinated. Security guards. 

Cops give fuck. 

Corps dont back down. 

Decent human beings care others mask up. 

I know, mythical stuff  UK 7 day average 20k (equivalent 100k US) 46 consecutive days sign stopping. winter wave UK spent 51 consecutive days 20k, looks like wave surpass winter wave metric. US currently day 11 100k, long way go.


For us fully vaccinated, lot less worry about, still, cases high want anything risky. lot missed placed good hands career orators :(Politicians, celebrities, influencers, preachers). good message fear, hate, uncertainty. 

Today seems almost sun setting onto second ‚Äúdark age‚Äù ignorance fear reason hope. 

We create future. faith tomorrow. Live beyond moment next moment.  COVID-19 showed face massive alien invasion, would go war countries instead uniting. know, assholes like ones driving service industries fucking business down? work peanuts expect tips, beavause can‚Äôt better quit position filled assholes like you. 13.whatever would still driving always got jobs types. Go college. Learn fucking management c++. talk. Screw asshole. Nola since August 12th. sure mean first major city  reason retest. Tests may show positive many weeks virus killed. positive result mean contagious.

You clear 10th day symptoms started, would Thursday. good. I'm reading 3 year old rubs boogers onto arm I'm shocked. Shocked, tell you. Unjust laws meant broken. stop reporting/hyping monday catch numbers actual one day jumps? Username definitely checks Wrong. known standard operating procedure server tipped. Servers bust ass sit hour bullshitting friends and/or family. Everything need want brought haste smile. Need napkins? Dropped fork need new one? Third refill within 15 minutes sitting down? problem. Got covered. little shit. Tiny shit server running back forth non-stop quality life. Servers dont that. could take order. Bring you. come back 45 minutes later drop bill off. long complaining manager corporate higher ups dont give fuck. already got slice. treated like royalty server. given zero effort meal demand service.

Now keep mind, server running around making sure need satisfied food service, also 5+ tables.

A complete stranger pampering worth extra 10 20 dollars? that's case make sure next time go tell server face ""you're effort worth 10 dollars"". Lightning round. Tell take order. See kind service get person knows they're getting nothing it.

Grow help fellow human. Table service luxury, right.  [‚ÄòWe're Mask Police.' OC Sheriff Says Deputies Enforce Mask Texas per logic vaccinated folks less chance spread it.  necessarily know that, reading vaccinated pathogen seems present equal amounts both.

We know vaccinated people much less likely carry virus first place. may great handle well vaccinated breakthrough case spread others, know vaccinated people catch virus significantly reduced rate compared unvaccinated people. corresponds drop contagiousness average groups.

An unvaccinated person COVID walks bar filled unvaccinated people, spreads 6-8 people.

A vaccinated person COVID walks bar filled vaccinated people, spreads maybe 2-3 people, probably less, people milder disease. top this, vaccinated person much less likely COVID first place, compared unvaccinated person, scenario even unlikely.  storage conditions updated refrigerated long ago Jeez, wish best luck! Hopefully get reinforcement shots soon boost defenses virus! Since many idiots seem want keep alive years... absolutly idea conclusion ""the vaccination fades away time since vaccin"" graphic.  Unless spend lot time sniffing groceries absolutely need wipe down. Got 3rd Pfizer last week. Nothing much sore arm little tired I'm feeling encouraged data. Great idea. vote? Vaccination card accepted i.d. ehlers danlos

Talk GP IMO. would assume better get vaccine eventually get Covid, think may underlying disease condition would double check sure. fantastic. bit sass worked cs, there's much allowed do. go way yell assholes see wild though they're really ridiculous. used love customers defended allowed to. Vaccines help stop getting infected all. Antibodies take viral particles chance infect cells. 

In fact, immune system capacity even without vaccines specific antibodies, one reason unlikely get infected single viral particle. there's enough overcome basic defenses virus infect cells. Short mandating vaccines all, else could hasnt already done? getting vaccines wearing masks soon beneath me. 6ft under.  Personally, would monitor symptoms otherwise assume negative test correct. sure perfect interpretation guidance, would feel good enough given vaccinated negative test symptoms time. hear new brand ventilator that‚Äôll proselytize them. Yeah that's somewhat reasonable option That's china successful. Incoming videos meltdowns Karens (male female) demanding service without vaccines. feel employees. That's dumb
Did virus learn adapt mask wearers?

It mutates copies around. copies different traits. point might get copy vaccine provided immune response fail target. That's extremely unlikely yearly vaccine updates. took year.  easy judge... ever poor can't call work, meanwhile daycare day .20cent dayquil pill away? Ohhhh, narrative changed again. Interesting, interesting. Amazing schools able open function fine last year‚Ä¶..  Finally, capitalism something right. Yes. far likely experience severe complications disease vaccine, even young age.

EDS known pose additional risk vaccination. Brazil people want vaccinated, thank goodness. hope year year nightmare turns endemic may live again. even bringing ID voting purposes that‚Äôs separate thing entirely. Won‚Äôt vaccinated person need provide valid ID well vaccination proof? else make sure John Doe vaccine card fact John Doe talking with? would probably need entry unless there‚Äôs verifiable identity info vaccination card otherwise fakes easy. friend used buckle seatbelt mutter, ‚ÄúI want meet Jesus, don‚Äôt want meet *today*.‚Äù fact remains vaccine Covid-19 better going around unvaccinated see lot negative reviews restaurants enforce vaccine requirements, likely hurt business.

Those idiots could also large portion revenue.  idea you‚Äôre talking mind business? think saw somewhere claim transmissable cigarette smoke smellable. sure that's true, so, that's 10-20 foot radius, granted, transmissibility probably falling rapidly distance.  Every kid vaccinated go school since earlier age parents know enough vaccines safe also took child. school kids learn importance vaccinated around fourth fifth grade. 

You think vaccinating young kids several things unique Brazil? exact thing done EU countries. Again, city EU managed vaccinate anywhere close 99% entre adult population covid. possible. still lot know. idea vaccinated people spread much unvaccinated based measure viral load - always correlate infectiousness. also know long vaccinated people viral load unvaccinated people, may fraction length time, would correspond lower infectiousness.

In addition, know vaccines reduce rate contracting COVID all. figure varies depending vaccine study looking at, generally mRNA vaccines still able reduce risk infection 60-70%, possibly more. 60-70% less people get sick first place, immediately reduces risk passing along someone else least 60-70%. church's leaders urged members use masks get vaccinated, think polarized political climate made lot people quite stubborn topic. kinda makes wonder really worship.... Therefore prove point. Superintendent better start dusting resume. can't afford tip, can't afford service. benefits working CS NYC call customer ass. There's def ""customer always right."" IT‚ÄôS TIME! Good golly. Depression.  think OP probably referring scummy shit UFC does, prominently taking advantage fighters paying lower ranked guys well.  like 85-90% people fully vaccinated, hospitalizations deaths would probably follow. 

It takes upwards 70% start seeing break cases hospitalizations, really copium, it? like committing-the-same-action-while-expecting-a-different-reaction-ium.  Awesome. reached herd immunity. Seriously! someone lives TX who‚Äôs children go TX school, constantly think myself, ‚ÄúOk, you‚Äôre going make live hellhole, you‚Äôre going prohibit basic public health safety measures also force children attend person learning everyday. LEAST legalize weed numb anxiety all?!?! It‚Äôs least could fucking do.‚Äù TIL San Francisco New Orleans aren‚Äôt major cities‚Ä¶ true vehicle drive autonomously 4th shot? wish Minneapolis would this.   horrifically short sighted, actually dont even know vaccination card :/ hurray me.  Although agree said mandate, sucks low paying employees ones get blunt idiot customers. fucking sad got point country since norm recently become acceptable people assholes others. ""What kill people makes stronger.""

When body 'reminded' virus, gets bit better fighting it.

Plus immuno compromised group larger one would expect: age, everyone's immune system gets weaker. elderly likely need booster younger people.

The fact people got vaccinated back December 2020. We're coming-up year.  Good luck trying motivate workers check longer week, especially current situation restaurants hand, tipped employees always paid much better would tipped.

Your typical restaurant server making $20 per hour tips, typical bartender making $30. restaurant would paying much tips picture. Ask servers bartenders live european countries tipping make. stupidly lost card taking photo excelsior app, totally saved ass six year old argue loves princess masks showing people store beautiful masks. enough overflood ICUs RARE case happens, doctor drive exception. say shall PERSONAL exceptions vax policy FDA approves vaccine.  cities follow.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  Mind asking state? safe? necessary? plenty people refused get vaccinated northeast too, many. .... nobody wants wants Dallas norm impending doom nothing stop it

Yeah, deserved laughed at. Yeah clean make money. Kids use abuse. Hey, congregations want meet Jesus right? meet every Sunday chat it...  Send regards...  Probably lol. think also misinterpreted person responded someone else pointed out. Absolutely give another one, alternatives lamination protect card. another person pointed out, sometimes laminating remove writing. personally seen data yet says delta lethal, crazy ton contagious sure, understand feeling. cabin 5 acres already toe water, actually thinking suggesting trying cabin first within budget. seen lot optimistic people realized chopping wood feeding chickens whatever every day forever fun while. hand also see people area make work 20+ years - possible, recommend lot research thought getting into, impulse. paid college mean tips good practice. know fucking much attend college. Yeah, would menu price included tips, that's be, instead dependent mercy customers. Get this. Employers need pay you? Get it?

What difference make customer? none. Therefore, employer paying better system . see?! 

Insults start know context. glad could offer some.  may something simple allergy one vaccines ingredients. ‚ÄúMedical reasons‚Äù doesn‚Äôt necessarily automatically mean severely immunocompromised, etc.  LOL Florida. It‚Äôs free-for-all here. small freestanding ER yesterday wife‚Äôs visibly broken ankle. 3 hours get triage 4 1/2 X-Ray. Many sick people coming could hardly walk. think weeks here.  even mean?  9 times 10 there's big enough fit management get involved side customer. Air travel U.S. emissions. (and probably) cut amounts travel, particularly business, airplanes get efficient.

Air travel important worth it. important people get know cultures important people able see families.

It makes *way* sense cut back personal vehicles, larger contributor climate change. also need design energy efficient buildings, doable, increase regulations businesses, largest contributors climate change.

Airplanes kind weird target, given small part problem.   word boosters? got JJ April available, I'm hearing rumors people getting single Moderna/Pfizer booster. new variant spreading worried? They‚Äôre getting close approved America? Research action, could always look remote learning jobs. enjoys teaching would allow continue add safety remote job.

Otherwise look basic tech support jobs. don‚Äôt use degree education would set moving pretty easily. Lmao must've southeast US certainly possible case, info tweet go of, find much likely unnoticed community spread got person passing someone street outside bunch restaurants venues permanently closed, museums extremely limited. Broadway shuttered rights giving up? Source? Everything I've read says help prevent infection. stick budget go places priced tip appropriately? Double want cover Ass twice. think died Covid ""in line duty"" - I'm pretty sure home hoaoitalized death think Nola use negative test. Exactly. Christian baffling...crack open Bible it‚Äôs pretty clear Jesus would issue wearing mask. happens write everything again. Better card destroyed. see ask Reddit thread day lmao  shame I'm curious restaurant manager's options are. someone refuses mask refuses leave, cops show called? I'd bet not.

My guess ""make waves"" frequent policy. certainly easiest.

If me, I'd post big sign said Masks Required Entry Service call good. take much seriously going featured lot next couple weeks media reports. Like airline stories except 1000 times frequent. understand, much less likely contract COVID-19 (even delta variant) vaccinated. infected ""breakthrough"" case, viral loads similar first week infection. still helps prevent infection. would think additional proof would needed, knows. Furthermore, know push use Applications smartphones this- ID'S smartphones?

Will interesting see things unfold. 

I feeling establishments extremely loose policy. knows. Cases may pretty high level hospitalization death nowhere close winter. severity cases declines, number cases necessarily relevant metric. I‚Äôm vaccinated since April tested positive. Issue is, sure already beginning July Europe (now US). got tested Europe like 10 minutes started feeling bad came back negative every symptom effects screamed covid. possible get twice short period time? 100% left. places already starting several weeks ago Seriously. shouldn‚Äôt report numbers aren‚Äôt least 7 day average. Yeah, seemed like real stupid take. Get vaccinated. Keep getting vaccinated. Shut freedom comes diseases. xD debate coworker said harder people think get fake Covid vaccine card see gave go using google, even diving dark web one fake named person created 3 days later didn‚Äôt want pay overnight shipping.

 (I among first US get vaccinated emergency approval me) Sure, logic applies, quantity perception matter. guess could go look bunch polls whether parents weigh risks favorably towards vaccines. point considerable benefits getting 5 year olds vaccine. patients sent hospitals outside Florida counted? Thanks posting this, getting 3rd hour. 

&amp;#x200B;

Did reaction either first 2? 6 hour rough patch second end world. imagine number Karens bad enough COVID, now‚Ä¶

Godspeed everyone working jobs. Oh, yeah, youre boned. That's even close thing, know it.

*Ten people* died week it. universe justify measures taking? I'm fully vaccinated parent 9yo yet eligible vaccine. actually planning take restaurant right (I literally leave house year got vaccine know quarantine!), wanted to, mean eligible restaurant? work kids literally can't get yet FDA-approved age? church work definitely leads good example - masks (and kn95 hand), vaccines, person service quite sometime (and outdoors awhile, too), change ventilation, etc. well humanity. sacrifice? hell sacrificing? Everyone shut last year. EVERYONE no, businesses corporations would conform rules little people. Cant that. ""No evidence masks help prevent spread disease"" - CDC

Not great track record. might part joke. enforce it, lol Good - nurses strip nursing licenses. (From I've seen far nurses spreading misinformation doctors). Ya I‚Äôm heading Nola weekend. Stoked implemented this. Bigger issue ... fucks getting vaccinated asshole enough get fake vaccination cards... law needs passed someone caught using fake vaccination card Covid, penalized shot gun someone (ie attempted murder). Mississippians feel way? Holy crap. We're definitely minority. I've sickly since kid. first memory migraine. school sick constantly kid. Like, real sick, faking it, lol. I'm sure grew home chain smoker 20 what, get bronchitis, pneumonia, flu, etc every single year. kids, hand, picture health. usually get perfect attendance. sneeze one time I'm sick, though. crazy. wore masks, healthiest year life. March 2020 February last year, one got sick. daughter got flu! Flu B precise. idea got it. one knew it, social visits, school. Maybe got lunch took masks off? I'm sure. Anyway, would believe many people went nuts flu. ""They're testing flu. flu thing anymore. They're making everything Covid."" poor kids husband many covid tests last year. tested flu every single time. masks mandates dropped, suddenly everyone got flu. Stomach bug started going back around again. one figure why. ""But thought things went away Covid popular."" never went away... People washed hands wore masks protecting people things Covid!! makes sense, reason, people want see sense here. never understand it. I'm glad getting here. I'm sorry get move wanted to, I'm jealous soon. younger two said they'd fine moved now, mom moved around high school. exactly fun new kid. I'm sure they'd fine, really want put that, friends activities happy here, part. like minded friends like minded parents, we're completely alone. older son college, he'll able move us wants to, we're ready. 4 years really \*that\* far away. way past year gone, seriously makes wonder life even look like 4 years. I'm sure things ever ""normal"" people take seriously. possible take seriously live life. understand people that. Sorry rant. feels good get sometimes, haha! state capturing one every two infections compared states catching one 30-odd infections. ""Kerala testing more, testing smarter. tracing contacts find real cases, testing also better targeted,"" says Dr Gagandeep Kang, one India's top virologists."" Yeah realize probably sugar coating bit, especially comfort nice air conditioned cabin (we place 5 acres right grid), hand I'm sitting right making edits 100 PowerPoints person two pay scales like font, kind existential crisis. least someone's finally stepping little responsibility here. Wow. government funded = taxpayer funded though  That's I'm still wearing mask necessary. people get vaccinated vaccinated, we'd probably little community transmission Covid, health care systems overwhelmed, masks still necessary except maybe crowded public indoor settings. anti-vaccers' fault we're still mess all. reason don‚Äôt see waves common cold coronaviruses summer. point, population exposed virus enough times built enough immunity virus struggle spread outside winter months. Right there‚Äôs still much ‚Äúdry tinder‚Äù virus able spread pretty readily summer too.

By way, don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs temperatures affect virus rather weather drives people indoors enclosed spaces facilitates circulation respiratory viruses.  need make universal somehow. way vax passes accepted everywhere. 

I‚Äôm guessing still accept regular vaxx card you‚Äôre state. fortunate enough already WFH COVID literally changed nothing regards work time. afford tip. can't afford tip 50% everyone says to. realistic. unfortunately seems people missing sarcasm‚Ä¶ 


you *are* joking‚Ä¶ right? Makes sense... That's remember hearing school reports say masks mandatory say optional. think 'the status' citywide declaration made?

For outsiders confusing, lol.  I'm talking kids dying, total numbers dead increased due vaccine denial anti-maskers, talking % affected kids dying. talking past other. Hate say I'm pleasantly surprised there's data suggesting low. thought remembered seeing study months back saying 1 3, 1 2 hospitalized.

I know someone youngish (36) hospitalized last year (April 2020) NYC field hospital Central Park. Thankfully long covid. Obs original strain. wonder number are/will different alpha delta. data coming insurance claims, pretty reliable. hurt business among idiots don‚Äôt take virus seriously inflated sense grasp science.

Any bad review even mentions vaccines mask enforcement signal Normals safe business patronise worthy dollars. like wouldn‚Äôt step foot restaurant anti-mask rhetoric taped door. 

The Covidiots segregating themselves. fence-sitters want grandstand PrinCiPLe tHiNg, go ahead get plague bus rest crazies. We‚Äôll society. Wouldnt much concerning though since delta lot deadly? source? every hospital pandemic. haven‚Äôt one patient wear mask room. they‚Äôre walking halls getting procedure. Private companies definition capitalism. Please tell aren‚Äôt stupid. exactly I'm going fucking do.  India report accurate data. one small state (Kerala) reports anything close reality report close half country's new infections. Awesome, thanks! way enforce restaurant health codes. Random audits. Yup, conjecture, finding still important. cool shit pre-pandemic doesn‚Äôt exist now? left church 15 years senior pastor let mask slip weeks ago. Apparently ""fear"" acceptable, masks theater, respect ""doc box"". Somehow missed red flags. guy trying become Magneto here.

^(/s) owners hosts. Please put kids making $7.25/hr front line.  it‚Äôs majority like pre-vax.

Do really believe majority people got covid we're hospitalized? Bro. Waiting tables paid college. could money good. couldn‚Äôt paid college making minimum wage, could making good tips. restaurants US want keep wait staff without tips, they‚Äôll pay they‚Äôre making. means you‚Äôll still pay exactly pay now, it‚Äôll menu price instead tip line. difference honestly make consumer? get $10 burger leave $2 tip, get $12 burger. What‚Äôs difference, seriously? 

Insults know you‚Äôre wrong, thanks that. I‚Äôm glad think I‚Äôm asshole.  really know sure. may infection breeding lungs causes true super spreader status, see many super spreader outbreaks situations people utilizing lungs (like singing, shouting, etc). Virus breeding upper respiratory area may spread easily aerosolized virus particles leaving lungs great numbers. March 2020. don‚Äôt Id prove vaccine card show really me?  Yup, absolutely disgusting US actively avoiding collecting data afraid it'll make vaccines look bad. feeds right antivaxxers arguments leaving vaccinated without info need make informed decisions. believe legal precedent nationwide mandate. precedent city wide vaccination mandates somehow recognize hyperbole think literally mean people set foot outside year half? Guess didn‚Äôt read news stories people dying home, especially India. Also, vast majority world received one dose vaccine due logistics costs. rich nations talking booster shots every 6 months. approach vaccination sustainable either   agree. seems sad people go ""off grid"" get third shot feel need it, especially pharmacies throw away expired vaccines right now. NYC, bosses laughed suggested start giving us one uninterrupted 10 minute break per day Covid.  many people died last year people showing IDs vote? lot?  Yep. Europe put hard work literally rolled sleeves. US copying homework I‚Äôll fail test end semester‚Ä¶. Oh wait, think that‚Äôs already starting happen seeing strain healthcare. see...you failing understand businesses decision. policy implemented local government. 

There NUMEROUS business owners probably upset this. Yeah, provides well radiance makes invaluable support class fireteam. might also valuable matchmaking antivaxer Leeroy Jenkins noobs garbage health build. Cool story see, thanks! He‚Äôs awful. Completely agree, it‚Äôs shocking many physicians scientists appear back LinkedIn. morons \*braying masses sustainable option federal vaccine mandates, United States never do. should, won't. Everyone get vaccine impossible function society otherwise. Also, large national increase production donation vaccines patents completely waived/ignored. hate GOP, Americans need take responsibility get vaccinated. means infect covid human, destruct within. involves deadly virus, whatever want body privacy home. picture cruise ship jetüò¨ fines given large number sheriffs departments refused enforce *laws* related health orders Interesting idea. imagine big factor whether done way depends many moment decisions nurse make based specific patient's needs.  can't claim heal sick get sick. Either inability admit wrongdoing (a serious sin btw) really fucking terrible hero complex. month, really? I'm betting 9/13 begin remote instruction. work. need refrigerated. risk would high people receiving spoiled vaccines. Numskull? People sure make hard discuss here. 

People morons. 
Pam maybe read data wants increases chance injury. Death. Call moron. Call numskull. people want Ben Stiller along came Polly. Let them.  churches businesses. Even pastors vaccinated afraid endorse vaccine, membership find another church take money them. Anything keep money rolling in! Well good luck. Get self vaccinated not. not, good luck. Darwinism people jump conclusions without reading article, *some* rich nations. article states, US EU countries take COVAX doses. 

Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Qatar, Saudi Arabia Bahrain did. worst UK: late June alone, initiative known COVAX sent **530,000 doses Britain ‚Äì double amount sent month entire continent Africa.**

While time, even left-leaning, pro-EU British media publish. today's **Gordon Brown hits EU‚Äôs ‚Äòneocolonial approach‚Äô Covid vaccine words. Wish better documentation vaccination, stuff easily faked mean, already done? can't quarantine babies tell cover mouths. There's clear process; submit record review request call. shifts economic burden hospitals blocks quality care others IMO. Serious question, happened before....I'll preface saying I'm vaccinated.

I got terribly sick eating restaurant years ago run bathroom to....empty stomach....

Will allow unvaccinated inside - masks- use restroom? people forced vomit outside unvaccinated section lol. You‚Äôre wrong see valid reason UK took many doses Covax recently, think whole article poorly written. countries contribute Covax right receive vaccines, Canada, Australia, New Zealand particularly need vaccines. really poor move criticise Spain donating vaccines claiming enough, time Spain still less vaccines people willing get vaccinated.  doesn‚Äôt correlate US policy US conduct - article implies.  6 month booster laid ass day. 10x worse either first two shots. 2-12 hopefully huge turning point, doubt we‚Äôll see 70% vaccinated amongst eligible populations. Especially US it‚Äôll hard achieve. Capitalism‚Äôs steady state without government regulation monopoly. infrastructure, resources, talent talk possible government regulation capitalism. see payroll pizza restaurant, servers averaging, add hourly pay, credit card tips, estimated cash tips. Obviously can't post this.

This sort secret, ask servers bartenders much bringing home tips. working together part going happen - US basically torn 2 sides hate other. tell matter. Hope vaccinated. good luck ""No evidence"" mean something proven false. means enough evidence support hypothesis yet. friends Florida. heard last night local bartender passed away covid, unvaccinated refused wear mask. locals do? went bar unvaccinated maskless, celebrated man's life. can't fix stupid, maybe Delta variant can. Come D.C. lot places now. Mandates/testing app-based verification, massive testing, masking contact tracing hot spots.

Mitigation measures triggered sewage testing levels case counts. Exactly. limited knowledge history vast experience human nature make less-than-optimistic future. 

  Serious teamwork required ain‚Äôt happening.

Edit: sp Turn around: recognizing that? anything it? EMS/Fire here. got 2nd shot first week January freaking ready booster.  Knowing 4mil sale makes fume scomo didn‚Äôt buy more. absolute idiot.  never fines people stopped interrogated - anywhere US 40% efficacy x 250% improvement = 100% efficacy, probably thought said ""first"", ""first major city"" report heard, can't verify might misremembering. true South Florida. Masks required places, ‚Äústrongly encouraged‚Äù others, lot people wearing them. Thanks insights. could see going one learning component something. Like, I'd give toe go smaller science cruise look whales marine life etc.
The way Cruises though get water fauna. I'd probably get crabs. Effective cheap rapid tests get us too. current generation much false positives kind blanket testing need do.  Yeah next? obesity clogging system right? 50 sets laws, 50 bureaucracies, could possibly go wrong crazy looking Israel's case numbers vs death numbers. delta time (Israel world's oldest covid vaccine program) infection going wild, deaths significantly lower saw similar case numbers pre-vaccine.

Now eyes Israel see happens case numbers third shots roll out. kick delta, things looking good medium term. US fucked short term though. Next 2-3 months hell. Sweet, always wanted AOE buff. Well thing hiring people average IQ.  *then*. *now*.

Basically Delta variant + slow start vaccinations...

Vaccinations speeding 500k - 700k day, there's pain come. would say sniffing time minimal. quit job is. Can't help community cannot help themselves. extra money (or cases token amount) extra bullshit.

Then mysteriously labor shortage. Unexplainable... Given reddit, isn't/wasn't remotely likely outcome you.  Beacon theater asked went see Ali Wong last Friday. Caught surprise luckily took pic vaccine card. bar went afterwards also asked vaccine proof. friend mine 1az 2 phizer jabs better worse dr friend unofficially hooked first dose start roll AZ jab get 2 phizer jabs officially vaxed. think responding arguments conversations had. even make sense context said. yeah unvaccinated crowd incubator new variants. circle there's buzz lambda variant next big thing. pretty much told family start tightening belts another dark winter yeah totally. sucks many things similar symptoms plus multiple variants covid. hopefully wine starts tasting better soon. love wine can‚Äôt imagine tasting :/  Ok, sure, study seems saying specifically babies toddlers, drool, cough sneeze everyone everything, spread viruses home teenagers, probably hang room go outside friends. denying that? No, that‚Äôs 300%  goal pretty much everyone willing get vaccinated is? 

Convince people get vaccinated. that, government achieved done job comes pandemic. Police city required wear masks duty, many ‚Äúunder nose‚Äù even ‚Äúunder chin‚Äù thing call FBI charge person custody. Considering cops anything fake vax cards. far example local PD anything it. I'm going dip try straighten things out. think everyone else saying private companies received incentive create vaccines, distro them, roll monetary incentive. money came government, came citizens businesses taxed.

So face value, yes capitalism. incentive market forces, pile money government.

Hope clears everyone's falling off.

Also, correct incorrect, love learning new things! links contradict comment, specifically deaths among children. kids getting sick, ending ICU, reporting I‚Äôve seen says hasn‚Äôt increase fatality rate among adults vaccinated, children make increasing proportion unvaccinated population. It‚Äôs exactly unexpected would also make increasing proportion infections hospitalizations. case throughout pandemic, reporting continues provide statistics without enough context draw meaningful conclusions. Statements like ‚Äúx% new infections children‚Äù ‚Äúy% new infections among vaccinated population‚Äù useless without knowing percent population children percent population unvaccinated. told ‚Äúprobability patient child given infected.‚Äù want ‚Äúprobability child infected.‚Äù different things, keep reporting same.

Statistical sophistry purpose confirmation bias. Quoted shame cannot deleted. Bodily autonomy reasonable expectation privacy, especially regards medical information. I'll give needlessly hospitalized, thanks. shouldn‚Äôt literally tonight? reported wild mustelids western US   Hot take: need police officers arrest people, left NY wants defund police officers. Vaccinations never going 100% successful stopping spread nobody ever expected that

I think people expected CDC Director said March ""vaccinated people carry virus, get sick"". foolish misinformation said national television. got pfeizer one.

Three hours injection arm hurt around muscles got shot.  started feeling weak, ready get fly.  lasted 2PM 10PM.

Also got shot shoulder 1 hour felt wrist liquid around bone neath trhe skin. pain, liquid sensetation

Today feeling fine. Arm still hurts bit like yesterday. Good! Life's short ruined fucking morons! Ask question frame marijuana smokers mouth disease tar Ooh, opt dress code?

What tardiness, standardized tests?

Can kids also excused listen teacher all, really don‚Äôt think kid forced listen experts anything. healthcare system broken, Covid vaccine currently completely free readily available. People take responsibility health. Agree I've heard many adults bragging lying kids ages getting vaxxed underaged never know okay good data.  Numbers article (2020 data, United States):

Total Line Duty: 369
COVID: 240
Gunfire: 45
Automobile Crash: 19
9/11 related illness: 14
Vehicular Assault: 13
10 categories make rest, less 10 possible. many transmission vectors exist, real way narrow since like major lockdowns limiting interactions. vaccinated 100% guarantee avoid catching COVID, reduce chances significantly prevent serious hospitalization vast majority cases. 

Unfortunately one size fits solution; know factors might affected one vaccinated individual differently another yet. know comorbidities various lifestyle factors influence symptoms felt infected, know everything yet due novel virus. 

It's necessarily smoking gun unvaccinated coworkers spread vaccinated individuals, higher chance transmission vector vaccinated individual vaccinated individuals. Unfortunately there's foolproof method pinpoint infected another person; make educated guesses work whatever facts have.  price change commensurate increased risk insurance company? punitive measure, honest cost increase.  anyone know baseball stadiums considered ‚ÄúLarge Outdoor Gatherings‚Äù? one argument stops spread, slow reduce spread though incredibly important. Ha, fair enough. Cheers! Well know half personally nice people ( ones know anyway ). think realize they‚Äôve made tough decision bite butt next elections I‚Äôm still proud them. think also realize looking low vaccination levels needed advantage could get keep schools open relaxed quarantine rules allow least while.  felt empowered reading this. Go you. I'll visiting weeks non-American. able eat restaurant can't even download app phone (app unavailable country) CDC card fully vaccinated home country? official vax PDFs show knows restaurant believe me?  Stick boys!!! second shot put bed day better alternative. following said love mom (also works hospital here). 

So let get straight. expect everyone listen common sense medical advice protect won‚Äôt. know‚Ä¶reasons. 

I‚Äôm done. one gonna take healthcare professionals seriously long don‚Äôt take care yourselves. sound like hypocrite. 

I also don‚Äôt want attending me. chronic patient, ten surgeries love people don‚Äôt beaten dog look eye. prefer blank zombie boredom PTSD late. 

Please please please listen advice LISTEN DOCTORS. 

Please, love wonderful, kind, sometimes salty professionals. favors. 

My took 2 weeks. spent staring chair. think need time poor brain. 

Just saying Kind you. I'm long hauler total relapse vax doses - populations one wants anyone talking about.  Compared cities exactly? Cause actually Americas dirtiest city comes even stories heartbreaking... God hope state adopts mandate. would love see uneducated mouth breathing troglodytes mald rights infringed upon kidding. Add new bonus family members get vaccinated compounds whole 'missing socially' part.  tough tell son take see brother mom's whole side family. snitch businesses aren‚Äôt enforcing rules? What‚Äôs procedure reporting? much want booster, really think working quickly vaccinate nations giving third dose wealthy nations. isn‚Äôt equitable, faster everyone protection, less likely new variants created. also available people got vaccines NY, NY residents. Since NYC close NJ CT, clearly one size fits solution. may made mistake putting much faith vaccine alone, relaxed measures prematurely.

Not quite since cases start rising Delta started spread, cases original strains started rising soon mandates lifted. also come ability file suit parent who‚Äôs maskless kid starts outbreak? hope so. cousin Marseille says never deal fines going outside, trust word much random Redditor. Also, kind extreme institute fines people need go live life. I‚Äôm glad US didn‚Äôt that! ‚ÄúThe governor's announcement came hours Tennessee Department Health Commissioner Dr. Lisa Piercey said new hospitalizations rose rapidly full month pandemic.‚Äù Quarantines deaths. 

Before vaccines, basically remove viable hosts path disease. harder easier vaccines. 

On one hand, fewer people world generally spaced out. general populace traveling leisure exposed relatively small portion area's overall population. disease infected viable hosts within bubble, spread anymore. Pockets infection would appear, burn without necessarily spreading locations.

On hand, prior vaccines, people really know caused illnesses, less prepared (knowledge wise) deal spread infection. lot things tried work, led preventative discoveries, asymptomatic carriers still thing could cause problems like today. Indeed. Wow. 170k new cases reported USA last Friday, today reached number well. 7 day average 130k cases per day.

I would call good. frustrating us vaccinated take precautions masking distancing again, especially since many owner restaurant way labor laws work made responsibility. like that, would effective protest frequent establishment, instead forcing people serve slave wages still paying owner wants. shop rules! hope pressed charges. Part problem legal recourse though takes time.

If 504/IEP call meeting, clock starts ticking first day school, set number days convene IEP meeting, point may able get change placement homebound education (maybe). paperwork get done signed pushed through. point kid may missed several weeks school - oh wait, truancy laws! districts awful enough pursue truancy even working medical issue.

If existing 504 IEP, can't start process first day school, also take lot time.

And then, let's say go along it, pursue violation child's FAPE rights. Even time lost. 

So yes, absolutely, every parent high risk kid pushing districts, fact is, district plan now, high risk kids going losing even more. backs parents even corner.

It's horrible situation, US Dept. Ed CDC at-fault every local politician school board. writing wall last spring kids would need options one single thing done prepare.   Oddly enough certain counties US, get MRNA J&amp;J immunocompromised. Good luck I'm guy, that's outcome feels realistic point. Another outcome variants differ enough other, immunity becomes widespread robust, within couple years becomes another common cold even think about. feels less likely, one see.  hence first wear proper PPE.

No matter vaccination status.

Would quite bad catches infects everyone test. Ouch. many people total? yeah protection 2 doses less 40 %. I‚Äôm confused going work. I‚Äôve spoken bartenders basically hands tied. city gave instructions enforce it. bar restaurant going keep record every person comes in. don‚Äôt centralized database either. People vaccinated private facilities problems getting info ‚Äúexcelsior‚Äù too. 

Maybe random checks occur it‚Äôs like people going come in, make everyone stop they‚Äôre ask pull proof. Hmm, wear skull stag, gain even resistance?  parents opt kids school dress code? Probably cos went effect today went around town today wasn‚Äôt asked vaccine proof. Went World Trade Center, restaurant, various boutiques etc nothing Immunity levels among unvaccinated gradually increase several waves natural infections. Among vaccinated, infections occur continue bring hospitalization/death. Covid gradually recedes concern overall immunities vaccinated/unvaccinated increasing time changes variants plateau. I'm getting kind sick people chronic illness support community saying ""my doctor said vaccines unsafe told get vaccinated"" health care provider functional medicine practitioner, naturopath, nutritionist, chiropractor, intuitive healer. ask them, MD rheumatologist, neurologist, endocrinologist, hematologist, etc... said vaccines dangerous? No, always ""doctor"" doctor said that. always dark underbelly driving force behind seems like well-intentioned people. scheduled appointment booster shot coming Saturday one major pharmacy chains U.S.A. ahhhh yeah misread persons comment didn‚Äôt realize replying to. that‚Äôs bad üò¨ thought generalizing saying security stopped enforcing things halfway through. 

it‚Äôs long couple days work since LOT covid rn üò© know supposed serious article thumbnail funny me. vial photos hopped there? nonzero amount?

Unfortunately seen data anywhere.

One might able look back party size change later, would include people changed parties too. society tips expected wages reflect that, excuse.

I second this. got really excited thought read filing authorizing 5-11 group wishful thinking. Wait get downvoted lol

But nah doctors thanked getting vaccinated 
I guess run lot anti vaxxers I‚Äôm Jacksonville FL  like you‚Äôre decent person responses informative. What‚Äôs honest opinion fact vaccinated still spread, catch unfortunately die virus vaccine (rarely still)

Edit . Example Massachusetts meningitis vaccine mandatory college students decades. nothing new, except ongoing emergency urgency less ""just submit form along admission papers"". blatant lie missinformation

How? 

Like seriously, how? Everywhere sub hospitalization, cases deaths preferred absolute numbers. many people thread deciding count relative numbers now? kids literally wear masks splashing pool. I'm like, ""How fuck breathe?"" do, they're fine.

I'm grateful sending school already said mask mandate anyone vaccinated.  mRNA, recent shot causes large immune response bunch antibody generation quickly. Well, social distancing enforced police NY little turned racial profiling issue mandates nixed. interesting COVID almost completely eradicated fear government surveillance people. time good cause, yes, criticized motivation counter terrorism.

Where draw line? vaxxed don‚Äôt support this. telling physically mark card stamp pen note vaccination? Mine happy go mask shopping online last night. view accessory. don‚Äôt know school mask mandate, kids told they‚Äôre wearing whether mandate. Prosecute really smart actually. many? 1.... 1 ship covid... 1 ship load Looking rules comment didn‚Äôt violate them? rude targeting state Governor, another user group. to, should. least time being. immediatly Demolition man came mind.. know movie Sylvester Stallone? According COVID-19 Vaccine Tracker saw, today, 50 percent 25-39 year-olds fully vaccinated COVID-19, 45 percent 18-24 year olds fully vaccinated COVID-19.

I'm fully vaccinated Millennial, still come across way many Millennials, Gen Z'ers spewing anti-vaxxing nonsense, least USA. instead refusing give employees pay deserve.

Again customers responsibility provide wage. paid purchase. gratuity appreciation service provided. last time tipped mcdonalds gas station employee? Why?

I've seen claim over, seen explanation believe this, Oh suburbs lot mask wearers. hoods, rather. Fools want places eating relaxing following covid protocols keep diners safe? I‚Äôm okay this. weren‚Äôt smart enough get vaccinated, shouldn‚Äôt around public living. aren‚Äôt living problem solves itself. kids fully understand masks need worn don't. nuance risk assessment people never learn, kid otherwise. 

Some dipshit parents using school mask debate way vent frustrations wearing masks. might see mask mandates slippery slope, i.e. ""if make kids wear 'em, they'll come next!"" stupid nothing inherently conservative ant-mask anti-vaxx. would argue actually conservative pro-mask pro-vaccine. service stupid knee jerk reaction thin-skinned, narcissist use pretend president. many Europeans care able go family/friends wearing masks anti-vaxxers. Yes, they've got share antis they're ones catered to, US exact opposite. power cure people covid. 1.5 people. 'Karens Wild' YouTube channel going get plethora content Yeah i'm looking for, laws. case city saying, law, business other, includes checking vaccinaton. leaves 14 days announcement. Like two week notice. Actually debatable. Depending age student, long term effects missing year education profound last life time. long term effects Covid infection well studied (for obvious reasons) assumed quite bad.

My point bad. simple solution vaccine unfortunately significant portion US population refusing option. stuck two bad options.

It's also important consider necessarily either situation quite possible catch Covid even online classes. Delta contagious enough quite possibly CAN'T avoided anything short vaccination total isolation (which reasonable people). Public freakout lot content Thought Cuomo resigned? Federally, it‚Äôs worse $3.50. It‚Äôs half minimum wage *was* last increase. Federal tipped wage still $2.16. didn‚Äôt increase tipped minimum last time increased minimum. 

When waited tables college, didn‚Äôt usually bother pick pay check. went home cash every night, check $0.00 taxes. enough enough.
either ppl get vaccine stay home. problem. Theres sorts stuff like there. concrete improvment, even relatively small better waiting year 10 years complete solution. Keep working complete solution dont turn away movement towards improvement now. Nice üòè Miniscule?

Do prefer word better? Zero, nonexistent, none: apply numbers exist despite small are.

.003% death rate, like statistic better? describe slum like people would able take shot ? going stereotypes instead basic research learn public health system works Thankfully NYC lot sense head states it. Southern/more conservative states residents bold killing people ask wear mask.

Not *doesn't* happen. Transplants bring bs anyone who's stubborn general. Also Staten Island might well Florida 2.0 politically. Exactly. Probably asymptomatic carriers even people mild symptoms easily confused minor illnesses. see lot business owners this. Business owners forced police unvaccinated people deny customers threat fines.

Hear out.

Pre-Covid, diseases enter peoples' lives. Post-childhood, worst people deal cold flu. sniffle here, ""down days"" there.

The average person scientifically bountiful country managed avoid coming number diseases, either science (eg, water treatment protocols) vaccines, etc.

So them, getting sick ""just sniffles"", that's litally entire world entire life. I'll take step speculate families touched cancer, either. Anything else ""that's happens get old"".

Go enjoy vacation. Honestly probably greater danger drive report michigan half deer COVIDed city wide mask mandate We‚Äôll likely need shots, laminate can‚Äôt record boosters. traditional inactivated virus vaccine way deactivate often different every virus.

While mRNA mostly shell delivers it, reuse different mRNA different vaccines, easy produce. mRNA also researched cancer treatment, create vaccine customized specific patient's cancer help developing antibodies attack it. patients years wait producing it.

There's concern western countries mRNA vaccine tested enough. fact inactivated vaccine available around time (in fact months earlier western equivalents) indication likely corners cut produce it. Alternatively would mean China vaccine developed pandemic started. According US Cases dropped 3% week week 4,449,025 4,352,835 last 7 days. mean, wrong, anti-vax people problem, even making horrible situation even worse.

It also variants keep popping around world countries vaccinated enough people massive infection rates (basically India countries line)...

Delta literally twice infectious original strain, suspected also harmful, worst all, lowers vaccinated people's immunity 80-95%s 40-70% effectivity... (still massive improvement protection serious illness though!)

So everything combined. shit sandwich got deal matter :/ Monday submitted early-stage clinical trial data Food Drug Administration part U.S. application seeking authorization Covid vaccine booster everyone 16 older ‚Äî people weak immune systems.  doctor say that? kind underlying condition?

I'm still following rules, honesty, mask required, bother. way see it, I'm vaccinated; get it, it'll mild case. spread vaccinated individual, I'll essentially spreading common cold. spread unvaccinated individual, stupid get vaccine. I‚Äôve also started tipping carry-out counter service stuff traditionally isn‚Äôt often tipped.

I'm saying right now, high transmission rates, makes sense bar certain non-essential venues. virus care _why_ person get vaccine.

I agree laid feet ignorant anti-vaxx crowd. sucks everyone. time I've ever show vaccine card adult went Africa government contract. Everywhere outside Portland metro area, Salem Eugene pretty damn rural anti mask/vax. That‚Äôs half state‚Äôs population. Thats one thousand anti vaxxers.  headlines always concerning names come first. know people long term covid, disabling sure, maybe lethality concern. f'ed letting spread much. sure, would expect ""do researy means"" people ask doctor, come back talking lizard people planned extinction events human race New York Times [did really interesting study specifically, Delta spreads among unvaccinated vs. vaccinated.

Well, guess really Queen England. ideal situation, would continue wear masks enough people get vaccinated provide true herd immunity.

Unfortunately freedom fighters want cover sour expressions slowing societies ability push through. Sorry frustrated. It‚Äôs much machines staff manage them. equipment problem would much easier fix.

Also hospitals don‚Äôt accept transfers, especially would make cancel surgeries delay (how hospitals make money). might new allocation resources. Rapid tests reliable nurses needed hospitals, rapid tests might first cut. limited amount nurses, need staff care, vaccinations testing. already know bad, benefits testing mostly limited keeping track variants. Oh sure, think getting fact showing symptom breakdown. Like, people cough 6 weeks--I think that's closer within bounds ""normal"" prolonged recovery vs. people severely fatigued 6 weeks later. feel like people making living wages, since they're often not, tipping imperfect reasonable substitute that.

That said, tipping supposed capture entire value service, pay cost coffee beans, water, electricity, equipment, rent coffee shop. Considering cup coffee cost nice place, I'm pretty sure factors lot that.

(But said, lot people type work getting paid nearly enough put with.) kind seems like making stand wrong person. still go pay owner company service product, refuse tip, person hurting employee.

The company still making money want, care employees suffer? 

If really problem company doing, one would think give money all, instead refusing give employees pay deserve. guess they'd resistance/complications locals NYC, I'd say would Staten Island. surprised business owners even ask proof vax, think they'd care getting busted enforcing it, either. bar owner Daniel Presti Staten Island [ran NYC sheriff's want comply COVID regulations, defiant way through. works coming side though. educated non-looney side tried use evidence lying probably lying everything else too.

May still tested NYC trying keep unvaccinated people safe, keep hospitals normal capacity, less sick people dead people mean productive economy whole (i.e. loss workforce) could still much stress put people‚Äôs immune systems 90% infection protection 96% hospitalization covid patients too.

You chose follow medical advice wear mask get vaccine, want medical experts help you? said wasn‚Äôt bad Lord would protect you? Let protect back couch, let people part first priority. two studies show Moderna efficacy presentation slide Dr. Carlos Del Rio Emory University UCSF School Medicine presentation done Aug 12, around 33:17 minutes.

One Mayo Clinic shows Pifzer 42% vs 76% Moderna infection.

Another one Qatar study shows Pfizer 53.5% vs 84.8% Moderna infection.

Of course, still excellent severe disease/hospitalization. Sorry slums still getting vaccinated. really know Brazil works

Perhaps Switzerland good thought Yes, spread less virus get sick. Pretty sure Venn diagram antivaxxers, people care others people follow rules circle. Everyone vaccinate protect other.

And rest us care unvaccinated people exactly?  Whereas US really preparing all, we're letting happen.

We're long past point virus going become endemic, mean stop things make sense mitigating effects. Like masks vaccines.

Literally first paragraphs. Maybe pick hooked phonics sometime huh?  less people dying covid vaccines (maybe?) better medical treatment right? virus less dangerous right? Still far protection alpha variant Basically, answer starts here: federal notice, public health emergencies feds, well state governments defined laws, extra latitude imposing rules regulations outside norm within scope laid feds/states. already tried saying dont wear masks, worked great.. 

It's probably part surge right (besides unvaccinated people) vaccinated people stopped wearing masks per CDC, got covid asymptomatic bc vaccine prevented getting sick, get tested either could spread (supposedly likely though regular covid) vaccinated people getting Delta prevent getting sick much, hence rising cases bc get tested since symptoms, transmissable vaccinated people too..

It's certainly main cause vaccination rates half helped, know unvaccinated people decided wear masks anymore bc :/ Great. sure even allowed that, yet. would love know safety profile additional shot is.

I would hope survived first two without major issues third breeze (at least terms serious complications).   Well case that‚Äôs called assault crime. difference chances happening much lower reasonable precautions taken Hell yeah, hopefully rest country follows suit. Maybe federal mandate...

Abstract 
Background 
Effective treatment Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) intensive research. Nigella sativa oil (NSO) herbal medicine antiviral immunomodulatory activities, recommended treatment COVID-19. study aimed evaluate efficacy NSO treatment patients COVID-19. 
 
Methods 
All adult patients mild COVID-19 symptoms presented King Abdulaziz University Hospital, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, recruited open label randomized clinical trial (RCT). randomly divided control treatment groups, latter receiving 500‚Äâmg NSO (MARNYS¬Æ Cuminmar) twice daily 10 days. Symptoms daily monitored via telecommunication. primary outcome focused percentage patients recovered (symptom-free 3 days) within 14-days. trial registered clinicaltrials.gov (NCT04401202). 
 
Results 
A total 173 patients enrolled RCT. average age 36(¬±11) years, 53% patients males. control NSO groups included 87 86 patients respectively. percentage recovered patients NSO group (54\[62%\]) significantly higher control group (31\[36%\]; p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.001). mean duration recovery also shorter patients receiving NSO (10.7‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ3.2 days) compared control group (12.3‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ2.8 days); p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.001. 
 
Conclusions 
NSO supplementation associated faster recovery symptoms usual care alone patients mild COVID-19 infection. potential therapeutic benefits require exploration placebo-controlled, double-blinded studies.

Yeah, [this looks like street vaccinate 99% entire adult population know think US EU superior everything.

That's insecurity talking. never said US EU superior everything. even implied it. this, I'm still alive!

Here Canada many people given Pfizer first dose Moderna second.

Our Pfizer supply running low, lot people becoming eligible second doses, huge shipment Moderna finally came in. Moderna chronically late short shipments, finally made it. pragmatic public health authorities decided since they‚Äôre mRNA vaccines, we‚Äôll treat interchangeable.

I experienced negative outcomes, I've seen absolutely zero negative information safety effectiveness arrangement. life going county fair? ditto reported January well. Color skeptical ""5-10 days collapse"" prediction wrong time last 2 years. cry wolf. mention got triangle NC - UNC, NC State Duke - boosting overall education level state. thought imprisonment feeling funny again.

Eg: really wide range jobs, roles, required schooling falls generically ‚Äúnursing.‚Äù

CDC state profile reports [listed [county view morbidly fascinating see much difference extra 2.55% people vaccinated makes.

Other variables make much larger difference 2.55%. hospital system failure number hospitals capacity makes big difference. CDC produces ""social vulnerability index"". They‚Äôre asked overcome propaganda. That‚Äôs complicated absolutely something expect entire population deal individual basis. correlation equal causation

also i'm reading first chart (0-19 deaths) correctly lockdowns last year unexpectedly SAVED hundreds children's lives

2nd chart (which jumbled mess way) shows child deaths year par 2017 2018 non-pandemic years memory serves.

3rd chart shows vaccine works

4th tweet conveniently references something covered textbox third chart. aside saying 30% exposed covid vaccination would align quite well increase cardiac events. would make similar US states territories increases reasons (delayed care, covid, full hospitals)

UK covid cases 1000% since end may 61% fully vaccinated

The variant india right delta variant US uneven vaccination rates. Delta spreading rapidly areas lower rates vaccination. spreading over, situation regions dire.

Yeah lot people confused that, guess media never thought thing talk lol. it‚Äôs known since pretty early on. actually attacks lungs well, typical respiratory virus. attacks heart, kidneys, etc much. Autopsies early showed bodies thousands clots them, nurses described Covid patients blood like sludge. imagine it‚Äôs also source long Covid- many people it, snd without severe case.

It‚Äôs connected. 

Here great article explains I'm booster trial. administrator said full submission expected Sept Oct. it‚Äôs entirely possible

It's easy thing google prove anecdotes wrong I'm positive trolling point.

Again, personal experience invalidate reality. Yes, data Israel newly- vaccinated age 12-15 cohort (just vaccinated two months ago) shows almost 90% vaccine effectiveness infection- symptomatic asymptomatic disease- found earlier variants soon vaccination started. compares current vaccine effectiveness 45% age 16-19 group vaccinated six months ago.  


This data shows Prozer vaccine effective delta, needs high level antibodies it. Third shot take care 200% fact triple.  100% double absolutely missed point. I'm talking legality numskull, I'm talking statistics.

Logistically probably sustainable though.  Burlington injected 15k college kids. 

If kids vaccinated, that's case increases come from. understand mechanisms behind long covid develop better therapeutics make manageable achieve sterilizing immunity version vaccine. Also need keep mutations low study vaccines therapeutics work. Pandemics take time.

And exactly normalcy ""promised?"" Yep. Service luxury, necessity. 

I'm perfectly capable making coffee, sometimes enjoy luxury someone else make me. service worth something me. tip. We're locking NYC hospitalizations deaths low. 

At point, Covid-19 going endemic. Delta's R0 high voluntary vaccination current vaccines stop it. we're moving learn live phase pandemic. Well per logic vaccinated folks less chance spread it. 

However, necessarily know that, reading vaccinated pathogen seems present equal amounts both. 

So vaccinated folks better immune response fight off, potentially lowering transmissibility within shorter time span non vaccinated. Vaccinated experience theoretically experience severe symptoms non vaccinated people will... however still spread same.

My conclusion vaccinated go restaurant...or crowded places still potentially get spread whether experience symptoms not. get infection rate go back 2020 lockdown? let vaccinated people could still potentially transmit within shorter amount time. states? they're wrecking healthcare system. People can't get needed surgeries unvaccinated idiots taking resources. around kids mask up. Republicans getting wish! Yep. Sadly, family member FL hospitalized COVID right although quite convinced ""it's flu."" Heard said she'd always wear mask showed symptoms, even home. little late that.

I'm legitimately asking. think masking go away?

For record, I'm actually planning wearing n95 masks public transportation winter rest life. that's personal choice. ICUs filled COVID patients, though. They're filled RSV viruses, therefore leaving room hospitalized COVID. I'm saying children hospitalized COVID, I'm saying COVID what's filling ICUs.

Mobilize army stop covid Iceland ~75% fully vaxxed count people recovered natural infection estimated 80% yet still recording high number new infections daily. blueprint happening everywhere else despite vaccination, Delta stay, going run course. practically fully vaccinated country

It's though. Realistically probably needs minimum mid-80s percentage-wise really considered ""fully vaccinated"". seriously regarded scientist outright said 60-70% enough. scientists speculated that, along pre-existing immunity, 60-70% vaccination may enough, that's nowhere near practically fully vaccinated. I'm guessing better Manhattan vax rate like 85% boroughs. mean, reasons mitigate spread, one formation new variants. Two transmissibility patrons involuntary unvaccinated persons homes. Three coercive means get unvaccinated vaccinated. Note: HIPPAs we‚Äôre violated making statement

Nature Boy himself. Awesome! Let's say two rooms. One 100 people fully vaccinated 100 people unvaccinated. one wearing masks either room.

COVID Delta Variant somehow room (maybe 5 people asymptomatic)

While rates vary vaccine, let's say average 75% efficacy Delta.

Someone unvaccinated 0% efficacy Delta.

**Will exact amount people get COVID room?**

Now let's take another step, go website like this, see infection rate: 1000 people COVID rate 1.3% means (1000 \* 1.3) = 1,300 (the virus spreading).

If 1000 people COVID rate 0.9 means (1000 \* 0.9) = 900 (the virus declining... 900 transmit 0.9 = 810 (and on).

Applied room idea. 5 people give 7 people unvaccinated room vs. 5 people giving 2 vaccinated room. virus die out.

We need get infection rate low possible.  Sort of. I've heard lot vaccine hesitant (that trump supporters, educated superstitious) going get vaccinated dealing rules like constant tests worth hassle, bad idea Bro, u even lift?

No. people 5% chance death would mean they're likely die got vaccine that's true all.

95% effective death means 95% cases would resulted death, instead didn't. Put another way vaccine prevents 19 every 20 deaths.

So 1% (1/100) chance catching Covid dying without vaccine, would .05% (1/2000) chance vaccine. No, believe correct way read 95% less likely die unvaccinated person. 115 fewer patients one fewer hospital reported data? Countries using incredibly scarce, expensive, requires storage technologically advanced freezers many countries have. spaces, close encounters, sweaty dance clubs

The people listen, listened (including me). words scrutinized, taken context, media downplays message. 

Things come mind journalists ask ""what goggles, would help prevent getting virus?"" doctor understands viruses spread, simple ""Yes - would help"" turns headline reading ""Fauci Recommends Goggles"". 

Our entertainment (aka news) turned important information knowledgeable people mockery.

According proponents anti-racism, racist policy.

The plan something many developed countries already achieved: vaccinate everyone wants get vaccinated. countries still raise vaccination rates convincing people, less done job comes happens get new strain infectious Delta variant lot immune vaccines

It's fairly obvious: develop new vaccines implement restrictions needed. hypothetical scenario hopefully plan failure

What?? failure? Thanks vaccines, deaths rates compared infection rates dropping everywhere significant percentage population vaccinated.

Yeah, that's people getting vaccinated. encourage vaccination would default required staff patrons. Vaccinations shot France similar (though harder game) system announced. higher vaccination rate directly means lower risk dealing hospital capacity issues what's happening south. Especially since vaccination rates vary drastically neighborhoods. know arguments around natural immunity, idea take gamble relying levels alone.

There's nuance comes vaccinated people spread. vaccines basically allow people fight faster. mean fighting relatively quickly easier previous varients still still happening extent Delta varient. Even someone gets infected similar viral load start, fight virus longer contagious sooner. reduces overall spread virus.

Basically vaccines provide sterilizing immunity nose, system, ready fight. fast fight varies person person. I'm trying stir pot, last 3 weeks, wife know 12 people who've come minor Covid cases (fever, aches, fatigue) everyone circle fully vaccinated. UGH!!

Before vaccines came out, one family member tested positive. everyone lockdown time - people cautious.

Still boggles mind people keep coming it. really bad get second dose? employers checked. Maybe top companies, them. employers fortune 500 company checking all. sure information comes from, assure one checking anything interested checking anything companies announced are.

It's labor shortage point stretched thin is. hire anyone point. could go road get job 12 places right know checking.  point mixed bag. know incredibly liberal woman (who wears mask) badmouths antivaxx people despite vaccinated herself. lucked getting cold tested negative debating getting shot. know conservatives vaxxed wear mask times. know flip flop situations they're vaccinated wear masks.  really place. concerns psychological risks (sensory development delays) young kids wells toxicity risks (breathing polyester, etc). Sat next epidemiologist flight Michigan day. used clorox wipes wipe every part arm rests tray table's kids would sitting. remarked that, epidemiologist, knew exactly germs were, air least concerns. spent much flight (it hour) snacking mask chin. 

That little experience gave lot confidence flying. long use head, keep hands mouth nose, sanitize snacking, great shape! Hope found helpful. sure did! I've watching school outbreaks interest, think it'll one driving forces keeping wave alive - state's case, driving coming wave (since well behind curve time wave hits). NH, wave really begun earnest really. Friday, Delta accounted less 10% cases. expect rise dramatically next weeks, along raw case numbers recently ramping up. School starts first week September, timing worse. governor leaving masking individual school districts. 

I fully expect school closures potential return remote learning semester, I'm honestly sure preparation possibility undertaken. year could well worse last lot ways re: schools thanks Delta's increased transmission capabilities, along fact large 'head sand' contingent regards likely occur. double helping Body Christ! people actually *enjoy* lockdowns? said 60% serious cases, infections. That‚Äôs huge difference. you‚Äôre sure don‚Äôt say anything. know San Francisco, giving supplemental mRNA vaccine people got J&amp;J. California, think would give ask.  There's parents begun attacking teachers this, feel service industry people.

The managers need ones enforcing this, forcing host, server, bartender, etc them. needs every city Covid got fierce  great true? would love that. 

But ain't world live in. Anti-vaxxers whine experimented taking vaccine. What's happening schools around country next couple weeks experiment. 

They're basically exposing kids prove delta really bad. Wooo!!! Ric Flair's honor I'm tearing news (he's known crier).

Good see good dude addition total legend.   service worth ~~something me. tip.~~ charges pay employer pays enough waiters.

FTFY  So. assume god‚Äôs protection, blood christ makes immunity bag wafers category scores high, no? are‚Ä¶ may sound sarcastic tell get second opinion (if think doctor might wrong) would encourage second opinion. year get *third* opinion something non-COVID related get root problem. possible girlfriend either rarer allergy types shots work her, likely sort illness vaccines build immunity suggest getting them. know, I'd get second opinion safe side. run gamut potential issues developing socially masks actually health hazard variety reasons. Mom's bawling ... physically shaking. people whine hard wearing mask is, pretty much automatically assume they‚Äôre babies. us vaccinated still deserve informed continued relative risk, articles headlines fine.

Just saying vaccinated person *can* get Long COVID says nothing relative risk likelihood. course, Americans think binaries saying get Long COVID them. Body aches, headaches, sleeplessness, fatigue, sore throat, dry cough. weeks. honor system fails, nations begin drastic measures get results.  vaxxed, agree method. would liked see businesses able option would allow entrance long there's big sign front letting customers know. 

 

Then let people vote wallets. new daily cases still growing exponentially. hospitals anywhere near peak yet. Hey now. We‚Äôre New Orleans too. Starts today.

Light good. Disinfectant good.

""Hmm, let's get body even *better!""*

(Yay Me! fixed all!) I‚Äôm similar situation - high risk child starting kindergarten. lung disease. distance learning option, mask mandate place live, masks ‚Äúhighly recommended‚Äù. children‚Äôs school principal told parents banging door yelling don‚Äôt want kids masks there‚Äôs nothing it‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt know do. either send kids hope best, homeschool vaccinated. there‚Äôs dilemma child care I‚Äôm work. provide safe education kids. can‚Äôt legal‚Ä¶ people going amend kids 504 plans covid protocol. restaurant owners (friends friends) pay bit pocket fees mandates pandemic (I think closing early capacity). 
So this. vaccinated wearing mask would care Interesting. worked right away guess got lucky. Still good idea try option digital verification imo. Uh... never heard health department you? Ugh I'm sorry dealing shit. underpaid underappreciated deserve treated like shit. farmed though, prolonged exposure humans could transmitted virus them. wild, must gotten exposed way.  acquaintance mine caught covid went blind one eye. always wondered happened, since impression covid mainly affected lungs. must happened. hear something Moderna? 
About booster? second shot February 9th  pandemic, used tip restaurant, food delivered, etc. started tipping pickup food said. 
These especially hard times, help whenever can. narrative changed again. Interesting, interesting. Amazing schools able open function fine last year‚Ä¶..

1) science change. That's theory fact.

2) schools able function fine last year? lucky guy, wish got obvious sign immune system working.  Yeah doubt came DeSantis. 

I heard state universities also conversations online first three weeks well, wasn‚Äôt random UF idea Yes presence autism well, tested accordingly. incentive communicate audibly sat home 2020.

The therapy helped made tremendous turnaround, cannot recommend getting services more. perfect computer, absolutely made great strides approaching expected percentiles development. Imagine small person threaten school board. Yeah one thing big study lacks effective symptomatic infection.  help mean probably waste money still intelligent western world get 3x4 waterproof covers Amazon. get laminated. depends *which* autoimmune disease, you‚Äôre treating it. example, Hashimoto‚Äôs disease, since treated thyroid replacement nothing else, condition compromise immune response, time recommended take third shot. sister law takes biologic medication lupus, known immunosuppressive effect, eligible third shot. aren‚Äôt sure, doctor best person ask. Boosters really, really work. [Slide 28+ that's half-dose booster, pharmacies right syringe yet. 6 months, people months from. think CDC front two things, rather saying ""we'll want point"". ""We'll want boosters 6 months, it'll lower dosage give fewer side effects.""

This idea ""needing"" boosters make sense. Maybe need need annual flu shot, half population gets tens thousands lives saved year. COVID boosters included along shot, ""necessary"" huge profit public health? Yes seems trend ‚Ä¶but underlying lack vaccination continue drive new variants possibly new surges weird got laid February form job 5 years, abysmal job search career march june year, fund nice place work followed biggest onslaught interview interests I've ever received.  


I quite content work give good work-life balance seem extremely supportive outside ventures, remote work home i've ever paid role . string horrible luck lucked best job career unhappy right best time look elsewhere whether choice like get laid thrown wolves. whole thing weird point.

What's weird people seem looking reasons vaccine worth getting, evidence contrary. need 100% effective still overwhelming net benefit. know looking school reports one mask ruling. ""living it"" working great Florida far. /s keep saying, ""Damn, keep making cheating complicated themselves, they?"" 

When extrapolate virus going communities elections, *still* refuse get vaccinated, hell even begin make deficits literal humans they're going need make up? course kids make people‚Äôs lives better personal level met impacted life. overall nothing done climate change prevent eventual wars resources means suffer point except ultra rich.  concern mandates 1 employee going every customer walks entire day. may ""low risk transmission"" mean can't transmitted employee customers Good. times like these, need people willing take stand logic, reason, science. Hopefully start end. Unfortunately, think northern states going get whacked fall wave. Way many people unvaccinated everywhere. clump together. Staten island NYC though Yes, key words still get transmit deadly 42% Pfizer effectiveness 76% Moderna effectiveness I'm reading

Will agree percentages better 0%? 0% effectively chance preventing infection antibodies. mean perfect safety profile? doesn‚Äôt even published phase 3 peer reviewed journal. Pass. I‚Äôm living like forever. vaccine mandate masks Seriously!! don‚Äôt get idiots Facebook sticker say, immune system‚Ä¶. Like yeah every fucking human, aren‚Äôt adapted combat virus imbeciles‚Ä¶ give body every possible chance beat it? US army US cavalry, advanced recon let higher ups know enemy coming, explain ppl way, give bodies Army advanced warning prepare attack, rather Pearl Harbor Situation, immune system caught total surprised stresses catch enemy. Currently 2.4% hospitalizations amoung 17 younger. Thats despite 22% population roughly 10% vaccination rate. Minors fare even better death rate.

At least me, major unknown long COVID situation kids well potential permanent damage tracked sufficiently. give one anecdote, talked another parent yesterday whose kid student athlete COVID last school year. kid started work preparation tryouts (track field give idea physical shape) well kept getting winded. going doctor, found 70% lung capacity. kid never hospitalized COVID fairly mild symptoms.

So I'm sure scientists publish studies stuff, requires lot damage done data even begin study. expectations going lot people deal decreased lung capacity, increased cardiovascular disease, etc. result COVID. Even vaccines become 100% approved everyone tomorrow, suspect still big enough impact become huge health crisis next several decades even pandemic long over.

Also agree, shutting schools last resort. several measures place that, although unfortunately many places active resistance implementing preventative measures like masks. craziest timelines, we've arrived. getting National Guard medical personnel from? pulled hospitals different parts country? getting downvoted point, could people going hospitals since know full? Like last year people starting die homes due overcrowding hospitals. Really, really good day vaccines U.S., especially virus wiping Taliban even half innocents STILL BETTER facing.

Many gonna die, that's sacrifice willing make, huh? Easy say millions could die gonna among them? I‚Äôm convinced Missouri reporting accurate numbers. hospitalization rate still climbing new reported cases declining mask mandates social distancing place. Seems counter every southern state right now. think smaller countries 80% that's still enough. New Orleans generally progressive rest South. Pretty much city. Suburbs lot anti maskers. Ok, makes sense. flown covid, yeah everybody's masked I've heard frequent air changes wondered really matters happen sitting next someone breathing covid. God bless No.  that's... Literally going risk forever virus around (which likely forever). wear masks forever? predict many people arrested providing false vax card. Holy shit! hhhhwoo! ‚ÄúWithin first 12 months‚Äù

Delta seems shifting math. See: every article pediatric ICUs last weeks ZOE study said risk long covid infection vaccination ""[dramatically YouTube video actually explaining it, number 50%. latest estimates Pfizer efficacy infection (this efficacy infection also important) seemingly dropping &lt; 50% Delta latest Mayo Clinic study, decent protection vaccinated nothing close bulletproof.

ZOE lowest long covid estimates around though, [saying 2% symptoms 12 that's half pretty small number begin with. long covid occurrence estimates place. Hopefully ZOE number much lower weeding things like lingering cough lasting 5 weeks, etc. grown adult aware risks decision make, mandated state Government.  company probably paying ton rent what‚Äôs largely unused space right now. you‚Äôre vaccinated, it‚Äôs safe work office. always wondered many customers restaurants would turn away many stop eating altogether due requirements . guess we‚Äôll find soon. dollar every time deal someone rolling eyes masks, using words ""but empty tables"", work long time. think crowded environments high transmission areas, dumb regardless vaccine status. Mostly percentage people still vaxxed. Yeah, may helmet on, mean I'm gonna put face grenade. Masking negatives me, immunocompromised family member young nephew can't get vaxxed. I'll continue mask protect others going business. There's much life bitching throwing fit something simple.

There's also strong ""if vaxxed, dumb wear mask"" sentiment here. went expo Saturday large number people saw maybe 5% unmasked. city high vaccination rates I'd doubt people unvaxxed. I'm pretty sure average people comfortable crowded environment mask on. really huge deal. don‚Äôt get fuss about. NYC back June went comedy cellar. required back get one made scene past year half really warped people feels like. Life always risk always will. 

Especially comes travel, risk disease need extra vaccines always part it.

There way live zero risk life, people need reminded little craziness. thank checking in! well fever broke havent symptoms since muscle aches might vaccine ok dont know get second vaccine ill covered less covered covid first one milvet02's assertion China tried cover virus outbreak? right direction always good

It's illusion progress. input capitalist algorithm profit. system builds things break buy more. entire system relies consuming scarcity - antithetical sustainability. system *wants* natural resources scarce long effect profit. system poisoned water good thing companies. people need cars drive unnecessary jobs sell useless shit keep system that's killing us going. Switching EVs continue try prolong system misguided. also simply enough raw materials (not even close) replace currently existing cars road. idea circular green economy ""renewables build renewables"" possible energy dense oil keep system running is. We've already done much damage able sustain system anyway (air temperature delay, aerosol masking) instead talking *that* coming terms it, we're talking EVs - though going stop what's coming. mean, we've already tried using paper straws, recycling, turning lights leave room, etc... playing whose hands here?? look Exxon Mobil: carbon tax right precise reason never happen political environment.

No, carbon tax alternative carbon rationing. point near future *something* done make masses feel like ""we're moving right direction"" pacified keep system going. go amazing carbon tax would much love making everyone feel warm fuzzy continuing pollute exactly rate always been.

And guess what, carbon tax would pay keep polluting say ""we're part."" believe say want carbon tax - probably want get something writing ""grandfathered in"" continue polluting X rate price. 

The best idea terms reducing carbon ration it. carbon credits. wealthy might excess can't use it, use them. Give carbon credits inversely proportional wealth. rich buy carbon credits directly less well off. Florida even reporting day week death reports anymore. really think they're going start breaking vaccination status? know people refusing vaccines specifically blood clotting risk lol. I'm like hmmmm... know else cause blood clots Yeah, people forget Delta progresses much faster used to, infection time positive test time much shorter graph make sense considering write

the number serious COVID cases rose Wednesday 400, highest figure since March. 150 patients fully vaccinated.

Anyway, articles point around 60% new infections partially/fully vaccinated, 143 Israelis hospitalized COVID-19 Wednesday 12 p.m., according Health Ministry. Fifty-eight percent vaccinated, 39% 3% partially vaccinated

People seriously need stop ""99%"" figure gets repeated often [vaccine mascot brazil] little week ago theme parks, Ohio. wore mask good time. got shot could live. high risk tolerance concerns go. know October look like pandemic. think price changes fair game, raise question whether making someone's insurance $1000/mo ok functionally denying coverage there's viral load throat mucosa, even present symptoms, would imagine spewing load everywhere. 


And one wants random person spewing load everywhere. Well. people think it‚Äôs big deal let get infected. It‚Äôs big deal stay home chicken noodle soup. Don‚Äôt go doctors use medicine don‚Äôt trust. Same. work service more, many years. Every service worker I've encountered since began getting extra tip me. hate say 50% vax rural county bad. Especially compared area. low 30% fully vaxxed, upper 30% one dose. start July people decided Covid go back normal. That's worked exactly expected Delta variant made worse. New case numbers exploded 1% pop catching week. Positivity rate 30% range. Hospitals cancel elective surgeries exceeding capacity limits. bad local government officials cancel concerts otherwise would complete collapse hospitals.

The silver lining, people realizing serious first dose vax numbers increasing. Still going enough get us herd immunity levels. *sigh* pandemics end, others have, think we're like three years truly calms (a la 1918 flu) pandemic like zombie apocalypse movies/shows. People divided, selfish stupid. awful time. Hell yeah, 30% new 20%. people earned many different ways past year makes sad thinking it. comment automatically removed linked source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*   vaccinated still lesser chance catching delta variant unvaccinated, restrictions still help slow spread, won‚Äôt prevent entirely. It‚Äôs best do.

And cases vaccinated catch it, symptoms less severe usually aren‚Äôt hacking lung, don‚Äôt spread much. work cops politicians refused keep us safe. get paid extra added risk labor, taken significant pay cut. sadly way Hillsborough county Florida. US government probably heard message FDA really (small-c) conservative strict meets standards evidence. ""both sides"" bullshit. One side perfect communication skills, one side denying basic biology public health, trying overthrow government, actively spreading lethal misinformation political reasons. texas doing? yeah virus doesnt thoughts i'm gonna go ahead think behaving exactly always has, continue to. Vaccinated people spread catch it, significantly less likely catch first place. That‚Äôs something think lot media sources bad job explaining. yes, vaccinated person breakthrough infection danger unvaccinated neighbor. breakthrough infection isn‚Äôt likely, especially they‚Äôre taking precautions.

This also encourages vaccination among people putting aren‚Äôt necessarily hardcore antivaxers. switch necessarily, switch jobs somewhere I'm happier. pay, better health insurance LOT less stress, getting berated boss worth money me. God, fuck U.S. politicians dumber unborn koalas. Duh duh dumbass Missouri dumbasses.  actually something, stands good chance lose primary.

He's probably assuming he'll win general election matter happens. feel gaining enough traction. People need push back idea either make full recovery die Covid. Kids going impacted decisions years. son turns two weeks. blissful 6 months lockdown. found March 2021 we‚Äôre another November year. feelings couldn‚Äôt mixed.  modern day Drowning Man. Same. Big hug you, child free friend. Yeah think least two reasons vaccinated transmit Delta same. One viral decay faster window transmissibility smaller, two, less likely get symptomatic infection vaccinated person which, seen data delta transmission breakthroughs, would make feel inclined think less likely someone transmit virus they're vaccinated. thought reading different articles would seem severe likely spread. course virus quite unpredictable.

My complaint seems neither vaccinated unvaccinated matter. cases rising lock again?

""Generally, people harbor high levels pathogens ‚Äî whether influenza, H.I.V. SARS ‚Äî tend severe symptoms likely pass pathogens  "
