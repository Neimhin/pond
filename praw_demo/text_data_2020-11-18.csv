0,2020-11-18," wont be, it'll largely Biden's show run [They definitely work people. experience, people quarantine effectively lie quarantine. sister-in-law ""quarantining"" 2 weeks prior Thanksgiving, know going stores, boyfriend traveled 7 hours see her. going Thanksgiving. stupid way down. words this. Nah sounds way united. could ever expect place like United States something like that? /s   requires handling distribution right, Trump overseeing it, it'll complete utter shitshow. culture war now. think Biden able much improve response.

The best make uncomfortable businesses individuals put people risk. encounter someone wearing mask complain, make sure businesses knows they're getting money longer. bet he's fine socialized healthcare gets. thoughts prayers think time ""say"" long long over. propaganda machine March, required statements approved Whitehouse. Agreed! need cap shit. wear six feet away people. However mask ready put on, case get within 6 feet someone household. thought blunt though. realize Trump administration talking about, right? agenda day one ignore needs us regular folk. Biden right spoken government run single payer healthcare. don’t think understand dire shit really is.  Thoughts prayers. Right? Already covid, since still work daily. immune little while. none people personally know Texas racist, things virtuously hold regard apparently 90% Texans are. Don’t base idea state neighbors stop arrogant elitist prick. Would need necessarily sort edict? emergency funds conditioned certain state local compliance federal guidelines? Cities states establish volunteer groups help enforce mask mandates.  Everywhere go see people wearing masks, social distancing.   Inside gas station, streets downtown, basically everywhere.    group people empowered compel anti-science people follow gosh darn rules.  Why? Outside able afford it, people generally enjoy traveling actually started using prescription stuff today, 2 medicines 1 puff. Commercial names different drugs are: Levofoxacine, cetirizine+pseudoephedrine puff Futicasone (Probably spelled wrong guess English names). even got SARS-2 antibody tested 2 months Dr thought coronavirus infection.. (sadly, wanted developed immunity) necessarily bad thing. know much travel I've done throughout career solved video conferencing. There's still requires face face onsite visits, least 50% doesn't. can’t stand people making “personal choice” argument regards COVID. 

I’m normally personal liberty nut, case exception. example “your right throw punch ends person’s face” practice. taking pandemic seriously going affect people’s well-being. *Some* people following guidelines means people getting sick.

We need get page, individual level way global level. mainly #2 experience. Yeah. I'd recommend least 20x20 grid. Get rid free space, need it.   news - water wet. saddening see sheer lack shits given people vulnerable virus US. lack compassion, extreme stupidity selfishness alongside Trump era inaction. heart breaks folks trapped cycle abuse perpetuated greed, propaganda, messy politics lack compassion. say whole world amazingly anything (Im Aus far one absolute gutless, moronic, disgustingly overpaid PM gov next- surprise, surprise) seeing circus US 'dealing with' covid go on... there's nothing I'd say said before. American Dream looks lot like government greedy old men shitting country people endlessly gain. really hope there's breakthrough end bullshit... People deserve better this. People stuck best, people medical professions can, around couldnt care dont believe could kill others, drastically alter quality life willfull ignorance.. deserve better. problem. nearly ordered commercial supplier even back ordered. Unreal. don't. rallies convenience nothing.

Your cynicism wisdom... get two confused. think probably expect re-exposure rates similar higher previously infected individuals. People already infected may believe immune tend less cautious activities. I'm running spaces Hate business travel. Especially flights Asia back USA.

Loved getting see Asia.  Sure certain degree again. go grocery shopping every day what’s difference ordering terms Covid? 

In fact grocery shopping every day probably higher chance spreading. 

And yes. Grocery shopping every day every day absolutely necessity NYC unless bigger apartment proper fridge.  Yes, waste moderator time.   base mortality rate, example Illinois around 90 deaths 12,000 cases. assume Wisconsin least similar amount cases. Golfing grifting. It’s called structural injunction it’s complicated. go wrong fast frustrating enforce. Brown v BOE example structural injunction. Yeah, demonsouls remake good.  graphs show may thing south win.  Fair enough, understand sentiments. 

I also reminded lucky gainfully employed useful. sense normalcy too. 

However, mourn free time could made use of: getting back video editing (such time sink), devoting time music production, learning yet another hobby, knows else. I'm forcing vacations December though. Seriously. lack mental fortitude baffled me. can't work home, neither fiancé. given up. everything mitigate risk. work elderly people's homes. There's way I'm risking 100 year old customer - 60s-80s. friends, family - one coming going. Granted little farm keeps us super busy. miss family forever. barely slice time. fiancé's coworker came last week - thankfully contact tracing got pulled work quickly get tested. ONE guy works closely with. I'm glad work ironclad mask/sanitize policy. fiancé sent home sane day allowed back got tested, stayed home too. whole week. get compensated days I'm self-employed. Fiancé tested negative. Boom. Mask job!! I'm bitter fatigued. Shit happens I'll eat lost wages - I'm putting elderly customers risk. One trip grocery store/feed store every couple weeks. Tested regularly. We're half way vaccine. sweat. keep trying best it'll know it. People look back much regret knowing stuck months longer... hindsight 20/20 bring grandma back. It’s unfortunate preventable. hope man recovers. ain’t fkn hoax president party leader responsible, contrary states. 

For *#!?!! sake people, wear MASK, practice social distancing, wash ya filthy hands, understand going towards winter 2021 bad pandemic position. Nothing. care somebody actively wants people die? them. concern someone care us?  Sounds like merely convenience necessity. halfassed measures sake ""trying"" something without actually something. ""officials apologize wrongdoing"" alien idea you?

It explains US failed controling outbreak. ""Lockdown city becauses anticipated control month"" also alien idea you. Thus, China (or government) lockdown city, situation must abysmal. right. struggle English. good. try hard trying hard gets far. idea philanthropy shared definition. I'm hoping progress we've made word, might willing tutor going forward. Guaranteed I'll success wind beneath wings. buy apple, pumpkin pecan pies eat alone watching Hallmark Channel movies. That’s good question Yup. home depot people longer new hires(I've 3 years) make new hires comes. workers profit too.   Schools never reopened states falling either admit they've gotten wrong multiple times go back remote, suck try luck pandemic lottery. use reebok anti moisture mask. took little bit getting used to, typically run three four miles mask without problem Junk food exercise can’t wait vaccine sub shutup. many people keen idea federalism here... surprised though. Thank much links! Slippery slope though. Today, national emergency covid, tomorrow new war drugs overruling states legalized pot. tax billionaires more, hardens position. they'll spend money lobbyists tax lawyers. 

*Everything* matter paying things. argument entrenched societal problems **can solved pretty easily** approached properly enough $.  I’m happy you. Apartments NYC known spacious pantries either. 

Long story short. Unless lived apartment wont understand necessity delivered food.

Not mention inevitable smoke alarm going sensitive decent fart could set off. ""Muh freedom""  No, simple. Covid patients take elective procedures beds get flat rate. extra 20% offset loss elective procedures plus average hospitalization time covid patient (2 weeks). damn right. don’t get? small Friendsgiving 5 people “careful” months tested positive. call mom, saw day exposure, tell may given Covid. Waited week negative test result. Super shitty feeling. guess wouldn’t feel personally responsible loved one getting sick, go it. can’t really stomach tho. even worse that, state state, county county, city city, business business, school district school district. 

Literally thousands disjointed, politically motivated, uncoordinated plans.

But cool. got guys.   Technically, far know, would take longer day catch anything (if still contagious), incubate virus, able spread others. one day ok especially masked. personally wouldn’t risk it. want sources europe decreasing infection rate Someone report hazardous working conditions then. Even means calling paper news station need do. food needs refrigeration. also keep several cans meat pantry good 10 years. trust anybody enough it. Everyone know makes lot ""exceptions"" especially family automatically millions dollars business worth less someone else's business? Fuck you. sound rationale countries able - Australia France fined going home without valid reason. Greece France app/form must fill leaving home face fines, police patrolling streets stop people make sure reason go out.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Right. Airfare, car, hotel, food week costs what, $1500? company make back first hour new years-long contract. Travel costs microscopic expense overall business, nobody cutting that. Oh yeah SA govt makings right response. Lock fuck virus right off. recent vaccine news makes potential new strain grant immunity moderately safely worthless.

That said, country many antivaxxers reach herd immunity vaccination, maybe contagious vaccine could useful. morally questionable though. Hey, people takeaway problem. everyone skills capability cook.

As dogs, try telling get walk today. listen! hospital owned Trinity Health Systems 80+ CFR Germany fallen 2008, Harvard Health published article getting enough Vitamin winter months. lack Vitamin winter, especially people living 37° north latitude, may explain high number colds, flus, possibly COVID-19 even seasonal affective disorder October April Northern Hemisphere. read article here: Liberal talking points Covid seem follow scientists saying

I think youll find generally case liberal talking points. I'm good thanks federal govt total power fauci says via cdc, fda national defense powers. wait still try push &lt;100 potential reinfections proof reinfections thing worried immunity short term.  miss school much obviously it’s much better social distance go. Chill out. Biden president now. You’re going listen sake country. Stand together, brother! Yes get 1.2%? 

If 500,000 hospitalized case count around 10,000,000 isn’t 5%? would’ve re-election come back “died with” claim numbers faked. It’s exhausting even talking mates driving sydney melbourne, things crazy tens thousands evacuated felt like entire southern NSW Eastern victoria gonna destroyed. firetruck flipped fire tornado many masks due horrific air quality

I still remember mentioned news mysterious virus cluster though, afterthought like oh thats interesting like hear small outbreaks ebola something africa We’re republic reason.

If state wants stupid taking action, that’s right. voters choose like response.

If state wants go overboard force people stay homes wiggle room, that’s right. voters choose like response.

Can republic go back republic stop slowly becoming conglomerate? Whomp whomp. DM came randomly one day see people wearing masks, next day everyone wore them.... lasted day. store also told things (cleaning, temp checking) lasts day. foresee much changing. Nice Fuck fear mongering bullshit. Especially age 65. powers delegated United States Constitution, prohibited States, reserved States respectively, people.

This one? It’s old people /s think people misunderstood he’s saying, included Time u kno live Missouri half people dont wear mask. Social distance anything. Bars full people. know deadly virus there. really messed up. Exactly this. take hundred domestic trips, trips result single contract, travel costs combined insignificant revenue generated. doesn't. DNC gone bat shit crazy. permitted 10th amendment says anything retirement? HA.. wait till nature turns heat. Coronavirus minuscule problem. downvote you, you’re acting like jerk originally stated. 2 days shipped back. back July. arrived next day ordering ship back day take sample (on weekday only). include shipping packaging label couldn’t easy. Plus stick swab nose can’t see swab part anymore (so really far all)  things wish things believe “not allowed”, so, come? Still pertinent climate going ""collapse"" though. Even literally burnt every fossil fuel earth, reach point negative feedback loop.

We warmer planet, likely less fertile land, less livable land general due sea level rise. suck collapse I'm getting impression turned race. us, money. would imagine second vaccine likely nothing. cost ton development return investment. Id rather wait one works best, one gets first, there's difference. Triage next. Doctors treat like mass casualty event. national mask mandate, national lock etc /s What's wrong that? PEOPLE. PEOPLE!!!! *throws hands air* AAAAARGH!!!!! Shut up, y’all lost. Shoo. would great, relatively harmless strain like common cold coronaviruses provides immune response worse strains. would know stage though? Caution still way go.  first commercial mRNA vaccines.

The technology goes back 30 years. Studies using mRNA [cancer going 10 years.


Everything read makes feel experts testing everything make sure vaccines safe That’s going get expensive problematic us without health insurance...have find doctor willing give script it. 

The last time went doctor wanted get script Celebrex (I arthritis), wouldn’t physical exam discuss Celebrex script mammogram colonoscopy. 49 time, insurance experiencing health issues except arthritis. would considered request get blood work check RA indications, declined tests. put records doctor see complied demands. Haven’t doctor since.  Found dunning Kruger effect  Says guy phone came assembly line either India china. Keep kidding 🤡. Inventors mRNA tech possibly. Otherwise pretty cut dry. said, live touchy feely world, wouldn’t surprise can't national respond republic. 

What mean you? think gyms open properly (masks required, wiping equipment required) risk transmission low people go gym typically low risk individuals One could say united approach states america missed worst state, New Jersey, almost 1 500 Particularly.... ta-dahhh... H(C)untington Beach. It’ll January 20th. voted pretty much D/I election except Phil Scott. fiance voted Zuckerman, think bad choice, Scott's leadership point think wise change leadership crisis they're pretty well... anyway, hope stay safe fellow Vermonster 🙏 No, replied facts, insist living own, made reality. conversation great example stupidity socialists. right wrong regards freedom vs Fauci wrong.

lol 😆 b e n always see numbers like that, account average. LOTS babies died (and know, wars). made childhood, would still live relatively long life (like 60-80s). Founding Fathers mostly 30s-40s then. Good  tokyo reports tokyo, whole country hours nationwide figures finish rolling in

i looked confirm japan done 3 million tests since january: bs. Can't report workplace OSHA health department creating unsafe working environment? fauci nazi? FYI article removed earlier bot covid. obviously think it’s good article. they’re gint overgrown babies understanding personal responsibility.

As simple Proud Vermonster Covid times, hope stick it! Funny, half assed response countries seeing mutations lengthen incubation time. Strict ass countries seeing mutations shorten it. know... take linearly longer number cases, certainly ""exponentially greater costs"". get increased chance surviving extra generation two, similar amount proportional effort.

The reason (a) willpower, (b) close borders countries endemic keep out. Instead, stay pandemic purgatory vaccines heavily rolled out.

Seems pretty straightforward correct everyone sales customer, want sales go back face face world.

In B2B software sales, pre pandemic always good looking charismatic sales guys promising world upper management engineers shat pants.

Nowadays become routine ask network, databases systems, whatever engineer need call answer questions, tele commuting resources readily available without sales guy got CEO dominating conversation. whole face face thing exhausting terribly helpful. he's saying this. interesting. Due hunting pretty solitary, dont think they're wrong go hunting. demographics/political viewpoints hunters however..... Sniff sniff, smell corruption.  Total agreement me, I'd also like claim much less insulting lack fines we've seen across country similar behavior. Yeah cure thing absolute bullshit.

Oh yeah, completely decimated India killed 95% country. Africa dropping like flies. US 30% infected growing fast. Iceland first case yet, somehow scientists around world making headway finding good distribution channels everyone get cure around world 7 billion doses months? Fuck no. need realistic Plague Inc. know shit really goes down.  New York New Jersey still far reach looking outdated studies.

I’m especially fond [Immunology Intuition Goes silly misconception. population/area tells next nothing country's state's actual population density. Bangladesh, supposedly one densely packed country world, 37% urban, 2/3 live villages. high population/area entire country fertile delta, farming communities unpopulated land, people packed. 

Meanwhile, North Dakota 60% urban. people live cities along highway, state land area inhabited. talking disease dynamic, matters average human human distance. fact Dakotans large wilderness completely irrelevant. Oh really cute mods *this* subreddit. tough situation.

Yes, called government basically gave testing contact tracing.

Thanks. may ""getting trouble"" America last country start pointing fingers around lmao Nothing approved yet

But also worth reading - following sentence: ""The MHRA urgently seeks Artificial Intelligence (AI) software tool process *the expected high volume Covid-19 vaccine Adverse Drug Reaction (ADRs)* ensure details ADRs' reaction text missed.""

Make  long term affects though ""That's Europe right now""

Oh really? Europe? someone living central European country, true.

What specific countries speaking of? Europe one country you? Instead outraged thought spending minute contemplate *why* that's case?

I'll give hint - care murders accidental drownings? Yeah, dare stupid media covering global pandemic could rather nice news local 20 people village ass end nowhere? insanity specificly: Corona focused subforum also daily news Corona? mad world. totally flip position whatever want rubes even spare thought it. really surprising considering way supporter first place essentially zero logic mental processing happening brain.

No solution perfect. less death probably worth stronger consideration. Japan's done 3 million tests COVID since January, Toyko current 40% positive test ratio (500ish 1300 ish) Cause effect thing. got Covid teeth fell out. got Covid brain fog. We’re still learning consequences disease often one Good, hopefully it'll help. mad ask select language ATMs

First time hearing issue USA.

Seems petty thing get mad about. Boggles mind. ND mask mandate.  trip Japan 100% paid for, canceled due virus. bold claim complex issue people less happy nowadays travel more. guess never heard correlation =/= causality? 

I know many choices lead unhappiness, yes. attributing traveling overly simplistic best outright wrong worst.

Here's studies showing personal benefits traveling:

[Purchasing spent (experiences) leads happiness purchasing (material variability physical locations linked positive study, women traveled twice year less prone depression women traveled less also lot research shows traveling increases cognitive capacities makes person open-minded new ideas different groups people. Traveling LOT mental benefits.

I'm also unable find evidence states experiences causes less happy. know overwhelming amount choices make less happy, research able find topic experiences points towards experiences making happier, material objects well. John Tyler, 10th president United States, born 1790 grandson still living today.  chances skip it? Seems like go there’s better chance you’ll get roped something risky somehow. way l see probably actually don’t want support friend spreading virus. likely get married celebrate married another time support that. 15 isn’t number think close comfortable. happy cake day 🍰 Frankly, think need travel somewhere talk people really outdated internet exists. moving remote communication good environment many workers.

On hand, me, (often fact avoidable) work travel key perk job. literally chose based opportunity travel around world gives me, would pretty unhappy went away. I'll happy go blast train clears snow. Looks fun. Sitting here, working Dallas home since March. count non grocery related outings one hand. Fuck shit. feel essential workers rage frivolous. numbers going high make feel like walls closing in.  Wall Street indifferent this. Every recession little guys bite bullet, consolidate market share, buy back stocks, even rich well time next recession hits. 

Repeat rich everything. Even sane portions, less sugar that, people die sooner later. 

There's ""dying old age"", one organs shutting down. happens heart first lot cases due bad eating habits. 

A lot Covid deaths would died anyways. 

**BUT:** whole lot (excess yearly deaths) have. whole lot die would chance surrounded family, dignity. there's whole lot people die all, die suffered anyways. there's ridiculously high number people scarred psychologically. 

All could prevented, given shit earlier. even now, late potentially millions people. 

People wearing masks pushing back measures contain might come rationalisations, end day, give shit anyone themselves. Fuck SINGAPORE/BEIJING (Reuters) - Sinovac Biotech's experimental COVID-19 vaccine CoronaVac triggered quick immune response level antibodies produced lower people recovered disease, preliminary trial results showed Wednesday. Hey neighbor! needed one since March. viral load Covid-19, right ass!  I’m professional poker player, I’m fine money.I offering example modest living costs city. really wonder people posted thread passed away due covid. One prominent members Houston sub, wonderful person ended working epidemiologist/public health person ended passing away. really heartbreaking. Legalized slavery... virus related... husbands lazy. culture many adult men raised needed high income earners women raised able run household.

It’s absolutely possible men women involved roles throwing years experience childhood window creates inefficient home. Many people cannot afford lower earning potential don’t extra help cover lack experience running household. resources endless experience equal would see many women leaving workforce.

So going forward support young girls obtaining careers expect young men help around house... Ahahaha yeah, see fucking happening sadly... Stay safe y'all.  evidence far reinfection would due different strains (or some, please share it!). saving response lol, thanks. feeling Thanksgiving see influx people hospitals listen warnings, start seeing healthcare workers showing up.  Yeah feel cases keep climbing longer. least SA 22 cases. made Victoria longer went lockdown 700+ cases day. would tell still recommended follow precautions (mask, distancing, gathering) individuals recovered covid. isn’t reputable source would state it’s okay recovered people follow precautions. comment removed, political comment replied to? It’s opposite work, new cancer trearment tech. sales trips collaborating doctors onboarded given training. Basically experts stood operating rooms doctors first couple procedures, make sure nothing go wrong. gather feedback, tips tricks veteran doctor. Sales meetings sharing kind things. actually really helpful. Since pandemic hit rarely onboarded new doctor, partially hospital get hit badly, also video training doesn’t give much confidence cutting first patient.  Basically mentality majority country. old people getting massacred thousands wouldnt care, “they’re deaths door anyways” Doubt it. hear everyone talking traveling ""once over""  quit saying - signs say ice cream. Therefore future. Yeah bloody Google voice recognition sometimes that. 
Quite annoying frank. telling would trust, business involving millions without even meeting partners? 

I send email regarding business venture earn us millions invest 1000 USD, trust me? 

Hell no. 

There element trust gained directly observing interacting business partner, otherwise unobtainable online communications. confirmed cases times? parish said youre in, another comment, around ~5.4% population confirmed case since began. Knowing three people reinfected, time span month, regardless immunity, astronomical odds. based math alone. better chance winning Louisiana lottery. true, wow. Anything possible. that's...not really scientific source :| worried fresh produce meat almost exclusively. That's local hotels Malaysia. Tired working home? Work hotel! Yep. Move day’s doses refrigerator, refill ice needed, good go couple weeks. So, important relevant news anybody? think also take account years 2020 probably also excess deaths. Many people could gotten treatment illnesses covid get hospitals treat covid. likely feel consequences later. Sweden managed get infection rate lower case. oh sure, also longer history whole civil war thingy 

I always seen stuff ""state rights"" regards US cool learn little Australian state rights (can't remember touching school)

should also annoyed Dan promoting EV cars infrastructure strictly national issue? wonder. think idea people tend get drunk later gets, drunk people tend watch distance. Thats 11 beds per 100.000.

That ratio France, Italy, South Korea etc.

And thats double UK, Netherlands Sweden have. Ordered mine Thursday &amp; got today. Pretty quick. Eventually? right now. mask mandate, want covid positive nurses still work. could lot help situation, instead ask nurses hotels rent rooms day people work remotely want work home lack room, many people house, etc...

You get use desk chair, yes, also wifi, quiet, nice view bring coffee croissants room! going interstate checkpoints? seem case. Legislation like without enforcement method numerous exemptions may weaken already record low trust government. Covidbucks available plenty conspiracy theorists believe you’ll getting Sorosbucks! 

I really wish hadn’t heard conspiracy ugh. come countries execites fully unified quarantine procedures still ended extremely high cases ? Exactly, who's going stop company wining dining clients, company B goes Zoom meetings, complains company 'lavish, unnecessary business trips'? 

There come point benefits business travel greatly outweigh costs it, make aspects business travel inevitable one make best choice possible benefit company. told you, mask, distance, trace like hell. Anyone respitory symptoms quaratines atleast get test results (usually day test), everyone exposed known case quaratines 10-14 days (tests symptoms). Local officials close public spaces temporarily reason suspect super spread event area. Whole classes quaratined someone gets infected.

And done immediately, decision made middle night weekend, that's information comes available. Places potential exposure published people know get tested. comply everyone suffers need bigger lockdown. react infection exposures, deaths.

And able keep restaurants, schools leasure activities open. Missing good news tag. Yes, 999 1,000 free!

(For benefit Fox News viewers, sarcasm) open 8 hours day, three days week

Sure, let's jam people store once! Countries pursued elimination strategies well end day.

On basis make claim? friend's mother got covid March month. Symptoms times. WTF. No, say symptomatic, said *contagious* includes pre-symptomatic phase. people truly asympomatic, viral load high enough transmissible, rapid test would detect it. 

See this: cannot detect pre-contagious incubation phase (and fair even PCR tests detect this). probably happened here. got infected two tests (the one flying one boarding cruiseship), next rapid test come soon enough (4 days later). Nah statement thinking launching strike iran  Bad bot. going take seriously, soon found informed workplace isolating myself. Never hurts anyone careful. Stay safe!  point keeps up, hospitals overloaded, what? terrifying. Sounds like go Target wife Happy cake day kind internet stranger! AstraZeneca/Oxford live attenuated vaccine, ModeRNA Pfizer/BioNTech mRNA vaccine, outside US military use fairly new. America's vulnerable moment since WW2 Trump GOP put thumb partisanship pressed hard possible. Fuck fuck 72m voters. incite violence political discord. honest fair world shouldn’t. Hospitals would never admit so, knows. guess! I'll keep I've doing, adhering guidelines.

It's annoying. even infections already peaked

Thanksgiving make sure happen anytime soon. Ohh noes! ban me! ban me! Please! Rhetorical question .077% population date died covid.  kinda still want keep wearing masks privacy aspect though haha. many people tell need wear mask outdoors need wear indoors, think wow cool easy like what's point school shutdowns social distancing sanitizing safe, people stupid lazy. absolutely wrong disgusting ONE panic attack thinking corona. lasted week genuinely swallowed small amount purpose anxiety made believe thats needed stay alive corona. vulnerable population Healthcare workers, im praying theres something help mentally ill get vaccine. general population seriously need .  Umm that’s gonna dawg Nature approves point Democracy ignorance celebrated

\-NOFX Honestly thing get told go  There’s place purgatory y’all. Come down! Oh got it. Sucks - do? Toilet paper makes shit layer thin enough invisible get handy attachment water. still use paper dry off. Best worlds. Stonks? way test immunity quickly affordably we'd able prioritize gets vaccine first. lot people areas already immunity time least. We’re considering Christmas. boyfriend wfh parents retired. already super safe don’t socialize anything non-essential. biggest challenge parents live 8 hours away can’t drive without stopping. I’m sure fine taking many precautions, I’m still nervous! updated today. Ok way immunize covid - theory (I’m saying true clearly isn’t)...does follow live rest lives sort social distance/masks world? one life. Kids one childhood. point, truly wasn’t anything done, going decide time get back reality? fact seem blindly willing keep mitigating forever upsetting. Personally, I'll feel comfortable calling people wearing mask rules place. Home “brave”. Florida, also eat outside, something hope families doing. family unit separate tables 6 feet apart so, risk, 0, minimized.

Still risk it. Imagine meeting vr chat. fucking awful. Trying talk giant garfield.

Honestly better trying take shirt tie seriously. can't second enough.  read article. found registry. thinking ordering spatula. Seems like fair trade maybe killing grandparents.  Yes able ask information.  Persons outdoors maintaining least 6 feet social distancing others household. persons must face covering times must put within 6 feet others household.


That sound alot restrictive cuz say see anyone around dark question important one. people die covid, long take hospitalized die usually take average? Yep. personally would like see California ban travel South Dakota pandemic well over.

Why South Dakota? Look up. year Nov. 3-7 pretty long too. depends serious want take covid.

Just keep mind pre-caution come contact best self quarintine 2 weeks.

It takes 2 weeks virus “be developed “ want say like becomes infectious. 
- dont ever want go situation “ oh fuck “ learned 7-10 days im infected. dozen people screwed didn’t take seriously.

Tldr; think 2 weeks waiting game see anything pops not.

if take like this, go doctors stomach pains. Doctor thinks something needs removed. scanned you, results aren’t yet. decide cut open find ate something bad.
- “ oh fuck” hope maskhole hillbillies big thanksgiving gatherings trailer park, hero governors like Cuomo, Whitmer Murphy send state police.  

It’s global pandemic people literally dying! wait another year turkey. eating plant-based anyway evs worker. feel appreciated all. nurses, pcts doctors treat use like serfs. already got fat bonus, work missing day lousy 500 may. indoors talking outdoors issue time open virus comes flooding back. wouldn’t “more” normality - way vaccine. vaccinated that’s me. prepared accept whatever results vaccination get back normal. relatively young (not super young) person. prepared short term situation sucked I’m going spend years life (the best years) well kids’ whole childhoods avoiding covid. vaccine doesn’t “end” pandemic, think need accept move on. Regardless, vaccine certainly make situation dramatically better. live viruses - deadly like flu. don’t think using zero transmission covid benchmark get back lives rational much concerned thays what’s gonna happen (the degree normality comment worries hell me, makes wary Fauci).  Lol. blown country hitting 10k+ cases day weeks Czechia people started dropping. numbers half still getting 200 deaths day.

Death stats lag behind infections around 2-3 weeks always case. Tests false negatives well. test negatives day 5 exposure, test positive day 8. South Australia like nobody likely scenario. Seems like overreaction shut economy 22 cases... mask good masks (kn95) follow social distancing. is. Europe. Since October, spike infections various countries like Czechia, Slovakia, Poland occurred countryside. Rural areas higher per capita infection rate death toll large metropolitan regions. Nicotine gum

Does nicotine exposure (NOT smoking) reduce severity COVID-19?

If chew nicotine gum (4mg per day, i.e., 2 pieces gum) behavior protective effect?

Where ask question, University Bristol, Oxford Brookes University University California San Diego neatly demonstrated spike protein severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) exhibits high affinity nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), significant implications coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pathology infectivity. findings published bioRxiv* preprint server.

The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, caused SARS-CoV-2, remains substantial threat global health, international economy society whole. Several major risk factors COVID-19 identified – namely, age, diabetes, hypertension, heart disease.

Recently, given seemingly low prevalence smokers among hospitalized patients, suggested nicotine might provide protection mitigating COVID-19, dubbed 'protection' hypothesis.

More specifically, based early observations smoking prevalence hospitalized COVID-19 patients lower expected, certain studies suggested role nAChRs pathophysiology COVID-19 direct interaction receptors viral spike glycoprotein (S-protein).

This suggestion primarily based fact S-protein SARS-CoV-2 harbors sequence motif related known nAChR antagonists may interact nAChRs. Consequently, interactions may involved pathology infectivity, notion known 'nicotinic hypothesis.'

Furthermore, also proposed COVID-19 might controlled alleviated use nicotine compound sterically allosterically compete virus binding nAChRs.

In novel study, researchers used molecular simulation examine nicotinic hypothesis – primarily appraising whether SARS-CoV-2 S-protein stably bind nAChRs via Y674-R685 region (i.e., viral portion highest affinity receptors). come ""They put whole election together week"" from?

We small scale every two years.
Large scale every 4 years. Agree. Pandemic could take entire govt. national security issue. good getting 87 years old. Basically usually close 10. Close 10, don’t stay open lol good. fine. endure ""flatten curve""...again.

The gym going anywhere.

At least still outdoor dining break monotony. they're ready submit FDA, means they've completed Phase 3 trials, likely see approved Canada EU sometime next week two.

Those health authorities running rolling approval process. means Health Canada European Medicines Agency getting data became available Pfizer, Moderna AstraZeneca (Oxford). time get final data set, peer reviews able quickly finish approve general population release. 

The FDA EUA limited scope likely going apply front-line workers ""at risk populations"". full rollout US still take January unfortunately. Fortunately fighting danger, get first. Ahh yeah understood. wondering would potential side benefit Moderna. able find vaccine administered appointment? Yes we’ve asking literal months. Yet Trump thinks better state state even though that’s going well.. afraid watch movie given recent events. Hi, know amount hospital beds went (1975 today) even though population bigger?  Same. honeymoon abroad news released, remembered nervous husband telling worry it. day flew back US, confirmed case came back airport &amp; knew screwed. flew back January 13th believe. makes wonder, kind travel remain? Many districts shut providing breakfast/lunch free charge daily basis. district cannot pick get meals delivered door 1-2 days week. also increased monthly food stamp benefit families school aged children help food front. far abuse goes, that's devastating think :( Communism!!! They’re coming guns!! Lol

Just kidding that’s gonna shit love health department ND Smart Restart page displays graph active case rolling averages positivity rate. also bottom “IMPORTANT NOTE: continue look data take holistic approach” 3 times criteria total lockdown. agree. Someone act results reckless endangerment, like throwing something heavy balcony (like idiot recorded throwing chair tall apartment building downtown Toronto, mid-day, “for likes”) usually gets shamed media etc. 

I don’t see haven’t arrived demons hold large weddings, events, church gatherings, etc.

 Narcissists would scared bad coverage. mean sociopaths won’t care weren’t gone care matter said/done stop them. Gov Whitmer hero! like governor New York listening science data right thing! horrible white supremacists showed capital automatic weapons bought Walmart. literally shaking fear strong woman.  

Hoping future presidential run her. Q don’t fewer worry time. Boom 💥 goes dynamite 🧨 worry, said ya. [Stubs toe]

Fucking China!

Yeah maybe remembered wrong. yeah rent piggy move give someone money deserve Thank clarification. friend infected spring infected weeks ago. infected COVID. may helped smaller response second time still allowed COVID contagious? “things never return normal” crowd. Oh convenient, goes prison dies shortly after.

r/conspiracy called ages ago. Saturday people’s needs.” 10-14 extreme end incubation it? mostly around 5-7 days? accomplished national response cannot accomplished state-by-state approach? 

People even wear damn masks social distance, national response going fix that? 24 hours reconstituted They’re getting sick things assuming it’s covid. Reinfection isn’t real, except cases severe immunocompromise. won't. Gonna dick noses chin diapers around. say anyone truly wants get this, wear mask *properly,* wash hands regular bar soap (not perfumed lotion crap pump bottle), touch face. Isolate much humanly possible. know else do. Wowowowowowow daughter dyslexic ADHD, horrendous time year. said much rather son home know safe possible. daughter also bad asthma.

Good luck buddy hope gets better soon. Yeah that's wearing masks essentially everywhere light lockdown. Look crushed flu year, imagine corona would like normal flu year. Based understand:

There visual change vaccine. It’s rna strands surrounded lipid Nanoparticle, diluted injection buffer. coloured there’s way see them.

The vaccine might shipped together colour-changing package tracks maximum temperature, maybe electronic monitoring thermometer like temptale. would let doctor know good condition received.

If rna vaccine thawed degraded use, likely nothing. rna strands fragmented produce non functional proteins nothing all.  idea. story told online without lot details. believe sick times rather covid times knows really. He's prison virus seems spreading like wildfire prisons. perfect stage: enclosed spaces, multiple people packed together, terrible ventilation. Today actually day 19, 13. 

So even better!  Donald Trump's policies (or lack of) ***Imminent Threat*** public health. how's overworked hospitals. long people getting thing shot arm?  staying home mean sedentary. Looks like took weeks effects Sturgis felt... full quote: “They often incomplete latest 2 5 days, incomplete 10 days more. “

Another quote: “The death counts last 10 days Sweden therefore always interpreted incomplete count deaths occurred period.”

Another quote: “This means last 10 days data, death counts Sweden must interpreted incomplete measures mortality.”

And another quote: “In practice means Sweden might today report 10 deaths yesterday, reporting complete death count day might increase 40.” see realities America. Vietnam, power learned showing results (ie, bodies) shit policies actually pissed lot Americans caused rise said policies, media simply hid truth Americans. quarter million dead Americans less year, people virus LITERALLY DYING ICU, they're still denying real, claiming hoax. Propaganda killed America. can’t use entire population since everyone hasn’t infected. 250,000 deaths 11,700,000 infections. neither party seems think saving lives worth damaging economy

lol... whatever fam current covid. Carnival sold 18 ships scrap yards. Sounds like lot it’s 12% fleet oldest ships. number used something. number used assess danger threat. danger threat used assess react it. So, one threatening? virus kills millions kids virus kills millions people life expectancy?    
     numbers quoted meaning without context. look scary assume people invincible die anyway causes. number actually looking number people died Covid would die anyway year two.   I've seen it'll probably peak January way spring already extent; vaccine presumably finishing off. Hospitals typically these. I've worked three none them. one get one though, exactly common. employer would never check vaccination records, even E-Verify. probably lightest flu season living memory. already parts world. entire US civilian fleet able called need troop/logistical reasons.

A staggering amount commercial pilots learnt fly armed forces still reserve. Pretty sad downvoted, Democrats hateful don’t even realize it.

both sides control seem unlikely. think chance starting Wuhan pretty small, decent chance started China though.

Pretty much impossible prove started anywhere, back Italy spread moves less likely Wuhan becomes. 95% thing becoming trend. like it. Pipped post. Fantastic news around! Reminds Richard Pryor's character Superman 3. Reinfections possible highly unlikely. bigger risk many people say covid never actually confirmed PCR test. that’s idea. know Australians celebrate Christmas July. Good know :)  Even aggressive programmable thermostat settings normally go 55F away, someone pets floor going 55.

You saving whole lot 5-15 heating degrees 8-9 hours day(less set warm get home, start get home) You’re wild, one said anything empathizing viewpoint. “Current” key word here. might even already higher 1/6 - we’ll know 10 days 90% today’s deaths expected counted. 

“Likely... go up” understatement. *inevitable* number deaths per day go up. current deaths function tested positive 2-3 weeks ago. number skyrocketed since spreading amongst elderly. asked poster justify proposition “The number actually looking number people died Covid would die anyway year two.” response ask two deaths tragic. country gold standard pandemic response. developed world followed lead, need vaccine would low covid would interesting footnote instead tragedy statistics COVID fairly known point. hand long term even short term effects vaccine less known known all. I’ll take survival rate covid unknown side effects. life really sucks get house pick running something. Everyone bitching life, eating thing people value life? News flash ya buddy, politicians evil. You’re underestimating sides strengthened rigid thinking like yours. Basically this. Oklahoma sucks... Sure whatever say  I’m pretty calm.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  WEAR DAMN MASK. SOCIAL DISTANCE. safeguards know work yet people still refuse them. Approx 66k cases ND far. Deaths bad!  long haulers yet unknown number long term health impacts. 18% diagnosed mental health problem diagnosed within 3 months. 

Let along navigating health care system costs (yay USA!) sick possibly losing job you’re hospitalized, what’s happening kids them. Etc etc etc. 

COVID going massive long term impact productivity QOL. It’s living dying. 

Our discussions around COVID woefully simplistic.  agree, I'm hoping way doctors look liquids see good. Us Cases nursing homes surged time high. Pfizer reevaluated vaccine 95% effective age bracket. useful! one year anniversary COVID-19?

 November 17, 2019 pointed possibly first known case COVID-19, chinese authorities officially identify first case coronavirus December 8, 2019.

Which one correct?

Thank Pro tip, insult someone disagree with, lose credibility people stop caring you. RELEASE KRAKEN!!!!!! thought too. Like what, companies suddenly going realize people wasting lot money business travel? That’s awfully obvious long time hasn’t changed, presumably it’s companies aren’t aware rather provides value them. 

In anecdotal experience, expect kind minor cultural changes wake this, stuff decrease amount. think 50% extremely aggressive, especially long term - like we’re 3 years thing 2024, lingering effects stuff like this? opinion it’s going less lot people seem theorize, things go much closer back way were. People forget QUICK, move even quicker. Hell I’d love travel 50% less work 2 days week home, don’t see happening long term. Remember whole genre music dedicated 9/11? single song covid? fear would people thinking well protected covid (if vaccine stored correctly way know). people taking risks would otherwise taking. issue large scale production. Let’s see fast vaccines start production, particularly Moderna version. You’re missing point, thinking like dividing us more.

The flat tire analogy stupid anyways, saw seizure side road. him, scapegoat. entire American political system, including parties, blame. That’s issue term ‘elimination’. People think means virus gone understandably become complacent. understand it, people largely stopped social distancing South Australia basics recording attendees venues weren’t done.

I think jurisdictions Australia, even local spread, need stay little edge avoid lock every outbreak (much like NSW done). get mad it, design standpoint kind wacky ""prime"" spots drop list English language website Albania Azerbaijan. He's clever, clever interventional radiologist! Yep, small shops/redtaurants places still consistently see mask less people indoors. think businesses think they'll sell employees show smile. quoted link. assume post lies? Glad living Europe. absurd. 22 cases everyone punished homejail 6 days without due process? LOL asked death tragic. response was... ""your proposal deduct deaths..."" appears based article thought confusing. article said mortality rate 18 per million, emphasize 1 week period. recall correctly, 700 people died North Dakota, since 2 million people living there, numbers made sense without knowing 18 1 week. Wine dine. vendors sell. company employees free week work and, like college, take free fancy meals vendors. Maybe vendor salesman gets someone drunk enough sell millions software solutions. it’s guise “extended learning” presentations, justify business expense execs. many conferences. Idk. Like New Zealand?  S/.  Hospitals already overwhelmed many parts US. Mitigation strategies inadequate. Numbers like within realm possibility. hope I'm wrong. international people, capacity stadium sports event nearby state Queensland. 50,000 people present. Granted local COVID case state next days/weeks worth watching.  So, sounds like article saying field hospital really used patients decline admitted. (because understand works far home). Plus, designed patients sick (if need ICU care, sick it) lot patients sick appropriately placed there.

The article says 23 patients treated (out 530 beds, room expansion).  didn’t say that. challenged proposition: “The number actually looking number people died Covid would die anyway year two.” agree demographics people die relevant response, don’t see justification proposition quoted. That's experience all. Germany, mask wearing constantly become prevalent months Merkel others repeatedly emphasize importance. Yup, that's looks like. deaths course due hospital overload, given shocking size discrepancy two numbers safe bet unrecognised covid. I’m nurse too. Attitudes like reasons nurses kill themselves. There’s culture sink swim showing weakness. think alcoholism indicator failures look one another.

Sorry everyone strong you. seem lack compassion. Glad don’t work anyone attitude. Damn US got 330,000,000 coronachans?? Gran, really thought heart condition serious this. stored correctly doctors know? change color another indicator? get injected vaccine stored correctly? like injecting water risky? It'll relief hearing people getting vaccine.. even slow first, it'll great get good news. higher. Upvote comment, downvote story, low quality study. lowballing.

Every time they've wrong, every time, they've lowballing estimates. See dude thread.

Everyone says thing claiming high ALWAYS low. model predicted 70k begin ffs. extremely conservative model. enough vaccines everyone takes one end year vaccines get levels efficacy time people grew started nationalizing everything.

We need always jump one extreme other. 

Law enforcement already national agencies. Saying worst election system debatable, despite recent media pushes electoral system (which, in-spirit, seems necessary democracy function *uneducated*/easily manipulated populous).

We certainly need improve education healthcare, agree. 


As country - strong weakest links. quick google shows number comes biased enough, number coincides number affected Vietnamese, US soldiers.

Interesting that... 


2.7 million Americans went vietnam, 100k get exposed agent orange? weird...  us aren’t shut ins like walk outside exercise relaxation, even everything closed. It’s good you. Parents, let kids grow pilots.

This. flight ops either. fact, cut wide, wide berth around airlines. must it, gods sake, pay degrees it. 

Speaking experience here. That's 1 1000, first original established death rate covid-19 2 100. 5% done now. person dead another 19 die get originally determined death ratio. Let sink in.

Now understand Corona viruses unstable fairly prone mutations vaccin however effective said likely give 9 12 months protection.

Even vaccinations go perfect everyone vaccinated 6 months, could get another flare-up.

1/20th.... Remember. We've started. Thank wife everything do! People don’t realize isn’t extra beds hiding hospital. out, out. article two months old... I’m shocked didn’t get rolls ahead last time. Great job Singapore. ways get sensing things reddit.  wife hero, thank guys do. Wearing mask properly guys. assure one satisfactory answer. Maybe r/COVID19 way anyways lol Woo hoo belittling stranger internet based entirely one article written another stranger! EEY! perfecto meal: Grand Copy Pasta like famous dead Italian chef, si; ran thyme pasta way! today, gone tomato... wife's NHS trust (in England) notified staff vaccinations start month. It’s true. lost it. Don’t know downvoted. drive leadership helped promote group effort people would still care. see person also memory.

Don't know need deny evidence senses? people get upset dredge things memory holes, unaware even memory holes?

It's literally trickle truthing gaslighting, psychological abuse techniques. tell also people love abusers right despite evidence. course it’s meant to, literally harshest lockdowns world. nothing let cluster grow, will. think anyone looking. Chinese NZ would, many cases. Coronavirus isn’t hype? It’s literally killing hundreds thousands. talking exactly? 2020 realistic went window along time ago.  Relatively good numbers things considered  admitted 60 minutes lol theory ,if supply vaccines limited, unvaccinated could become suspect class invoke equal protection clause. falls short distribution vaccine based one's wealth actually happens quickly (probably). that's right anti vax would argue nevertheless. lot pissed people seen income disrupted options reduced vote first Trump Bolsonaro tell ""vote i'll fix you"" case 5% work Gonna throw two cents here. house COVID September. brother doctor, best friend runs health department. Talking them, data *seems* show antibodies help fight reinfection ~90 days.  course, everyone different, know enough virus yet. 

So house, we're still taking *every single precaution*, including seeing family Thanksgiving, even though *should* ""ok."" 

I've told family: assume get again, act accordingly.  

Anecdotal here, boss, tested positive July, swears February well, based felt second time around-how closely matched previous illness. sister says boss' son tested positive twice, outside 90 day window. Now, there's noting showing ever *negative* time, ??? 

But yeah. there's vaccine, even people it, I'd keep assuming dangerous. someone explain mRNA covid vaccine adjuvants would future booster shots, shots, etc?  know adjuvant - basically boosts immune response - works repeated exposure adjuvant. 

Could get (e.g.) Oxford vaccine booster 2021, 2022 - would get brand booster, due adjuvant? would need get different brand booster body knows fight Oxford adjuvant immediately? Ugh. high risk don’t anything inside others. outside. simply true. Less 15 minutes contact means less likely catch it, definitely catch it. takes second get infected. One unlucky inhale close infected person. Thanks.. see NY lot deaths occurred early knew hit us. like war zone. Numbers growing people thinking ok please. see large spike Thanksgiving. It’s sad US government DEBATE discuss vote stall stimulus deal people international health crisis. It’s sad we, health crisis government won’t tell banks/power companies/phone/utilities need halt charges short time forgive debt, every country (except slight few) like, “done done” citizens don’t worry thing. point fuckin bars restaurant dine-in still open? 

Why sub gone fuckin red?! Every time mention national approach containing virus get voted blasted! Constitution isn’t medical document last checked. Constitution protect fundamental rights case government take-over. NOTHING prevents government taking measure alleviate rapidly growing medical crisis. 

Yeah, don’t need welded homes Jesus national common sense approach missing! keeps happening areas get better get overrun sick people coming get back square one! Vaccine vaccine people don’t start understand situation we’re 2021 still year. 

Most people (it seems) don’t understand vaccine isn’t going miracle instantly wave away pandemic. It’s gonna least 3rd quarter next year rest general global population receive due testing distribution capacity. 

It’s sad. don’t lean extremely either way fact treated politically bizarre aspect whole pandemic. Truth there, however, Trump tried blame China. I'm sure worked millions voters. know course, think virus particles would build places like unless building really excellent HVAC system. What’s crazy since article days ago total we’ve added:

-	3,512 new cases 
-	29 new deaths 

**56%** Montana’s **total** cases, since March, occurred last 30 days. response? least 2% higher others. “protecting elderly?” Protecting would mean anyone who’s high risk free attend. **Pfizer:** 90% effective   
**Moderna:** 94.5% effective   
**Pfizer:** say 90%? We, uh, meant 95%!   

Well, that's numbers meant think suspicious that. immediately thought, though.

Pfizer gave preliminary results earlier week. refined result based data analysis. I'm sure 'final' estimate analysis do. Moderna, could data sift analysis do. like half year since big global restrictions don’t see either, safer mask. Yeah cause seems realistic healthcare worker Bismarck, ND. voice feels like fart wind... I'm surrounded idiots! 2.8 million US Vets exposed agent orange? 400,000 Vietnamese killed chemical agents? People act like America hasn’t done fucked shit indiscriminately kill many across globe. get nursing license, 1950s? Alcoholism choice, disease like addiction. glad someone like close overcame addiction. 

A bit compassion understanding goes long way. Stop panic buying toilet paper again. stop it. one people it, annoying ridiculous. 

Even Amazon sold toilet paper again. example official briefings: Hopefully side effects include craving eat brains. IHME always among *worst* models.

The US Army Engineer Research Development Center model, [while closely reflects expectations. I’ve reading lot papers came out.

And we’ve preparing like vaccines work since April. Spinning vaccine production distribution channels. Thanks military! one part government get things done.

We don’t need perfect work, need things work ok. Vaccines never work perfectly everyone. government sure heck never work perfectly. that’s ok. idea half population. No, that's mutations work.  typical strain could came South Australia mutated new strain person got quarantine. happened, may exist Australia.  enough information right know. North Dakota isn’t top pick learning math. trololing? I've multiple first world countries suck. Hell, wish police chill countries. 

Just like US quality/style life varies country country, state state, city city. Theres huge difference living London Rome, vs staying country side small house. there's huge difference living New York City apartment vs living California mansion. 

We learn overall systems place countries though. Yes. choose cleaning masks &amp; distance, choose masks &amp; distance. 

This failure leadership CDC mixed messaging. That’s fair point think reality short term going set lot people impacted back lot. cases maybe permanently. suppose it’s flippant way say long term see acceleration things likely inevitable. 

The net effect long time line better environment it’s shown people different way life (sort of) adapt to. coupled re-invigorated focus climate change mitigation you’ll likely also see types companies eventually fall extreme regulation face debilitating sanctions. lab handles -80C specimens time. They're shipped electronic thermometers download data receive shipment. see kept -80, reject shipment. No, rigged. need time body develop immune response. got dose 1 day 1 got infected day 2, would ""rigged"" they'd counting cases produce immune response. studying effective vaccine produces immune response. studying many people study randomly got infected giving body chance develop immune response. meant to, taking pause allow contact tracers thing spirals lock months instead. Yes know several passed. devastating.  I’m angry passing unnecessary - COVID19 response misinformation unforgivable. top down. signaling. signal herd protected feel better getting people upstairs want do. Surface cleaning good, people wearing cloth masks cubicle farm hours protected. Cloth masks short term incidental contact, hours indoors others. illusion Hindu cows True , people care homes also smaller social circles average person community don’t understand people turkeys make dry. scared making turkey first thanksgiving cook, it...turned completely fine, pretty much intervention me. #turkeybrag, don’t understand happening. saw expert say 10 days case. Politics dictated school reopening’s primarily done things would appear rosy elections; Trump wouldn’t able claim administration handle virus majority K-12 remote learning. election over, Trump lost President Elect going let science dictate policy comes pandemic; someone CDC saw this, grew spine removed something shouldn’t published first place. Early!? Dakota currently highest daily mortality rate—18.2 deaths per 1 million people—of domestic state country world, according recent analysis conducted Federation American Scientists. Czechia, country Europe, came second 18 deaths per 1 million people South Dakota followed closely behind 17.4 deaths per 1 million people. stats taken seven day period ending November 15. current science says 15 minutes cumulative shorter encounters separate carriers enough catch virus. talking walking someone else; talking people stopping chat minutes. Self reported behavior almost always virtuous reality, that's true definitely aggregate, even everyone said stop talk anyone unlikely that's true every person surveyed. Essentially I'm saying data dirty number reasons, conclusions trusted. best merely suggestion someone real research really want know. enough people get vaccine R-number low eventually dies enough vulnerable people around spread it. clearly don’t  can't tell asymptomatic presymptomatic early stages. Furthermore, strain early stages could contribute severe cases, people need rest. body working fight virus, even outwardly showing it. endangers healthcare workers. foolish idea address actual problem- many sick people resources care anymore. first example reversed, you’d want. It’s surprising might gotten coding right first pandemic seemingly caught us surprise medical facilities scrambling. 

Your second example comes UK. American source currently happening? hate guy... Natural selection? generally don’t japan. People follow rules 9-11 rage never deaths.

We many people die every month freeways.

The 9-11 rage loss pride control.

*Pride - one would dare hit us, did.*

*Control - care dead Americans, want decide mass-casualty events be.* Aren’t worried antivaxxers might slowly start wiping face planet? person 90% infected? Proof 3: currently see 96 deaths reported today coloured red. 

Now please tell - past two days spread two weeks?

We make even easier - deaths reported today happen weeks 44, 45, 46 47? Yes no? stunted imagination then. I'd see doctor. Germ theory infection apparently new science texas. Also discussed biologist/scientist tell test group works? super super happy vaccine coming soon, guess understand get 95% effectiveness based test group?

I'm denier all, guess understand 40,000 people large enough group much bigger margin error? assume must similar trial vaccines go through. possible either placebo control group faired worse/better luck?

Either way, cannot fucking wait see friends family! Woo!! Idk maybe people love families shit? lack technology accelerate time itself, components break days there's reason expect lingering issues. Shoot, make colder versions “penny bottle water” tricks warning indicators. There’s probably antifreezes melting point low. Freeze little tube ship upside vaccines. agree. Almost everything pandemic actually worse numbers indicate. False. Black bear. Fact. Bears eat beets. Bears. Beets. Battlestar Galactica soon doctors, nurses, first responders, country’s elite athletes likes NBA players, politicians families. 

Basically, soon people actually need elites get it, rest us. 

I can’t wait one back January find many athletes got vaccine regular folks still dying can’t avoid stop working around dozens people. 

I think going interesting time finally get veil pulled back see matters shit finally hit fan. Okay given went ""14 days stop spread"" ""this new normal"", I'm guessing ""Vaccination April"" means ""suck up, buttercup, life now"".

Bro literally wanna go summer vacation without mask go back uni need shot 😭😭😭 Okay, know worked. know would still germ ""work"" us speak could still spread it. Thank Study goes release see abnormals pop larger population. standard practice drugs vaccines. Pfizer take money Operation Warp Speed R&amp;D manufacturing, far received $0 US Government. However OWS previously agreed purchase large number doses future, conditionally vaccine works.

Moderna others already taken money OWS. Moderna nearly far along Pfizer, stating similarly excellent efficacy results press release. Thanks. need tell read see simplify explanation mind. understand well enough yet Yeah could set triages people selected small groups vaccine administered medics volunteer doctors That's... said, it? first jab sore arm days. mild aches next day went hiking appointment wasn’t sure could attribute vaccine. sickly ache though may due vaccine. surpassed Sepsis yearly deaths yet? know thats big one. That's really good information, understand before. thought vaccine mild dose virus, worried potential unknown long term effects exposure. makes feel much better safety it. Also discussed Bueller? Bueller?  Geez, that's depressing. Thanks breaking us! :) Point: SARS coronavirus vaccines (same virus family) would probably long term effects, since coronavirus family, reason fast adapting Covid-19 antigens instead SARS antigens, could look SARS vaccines decade-long effects. imagine federal agents trying enforce it? Lmao can't Would look that. Glad someone cutting red tape putting True, antibodies. still possibility given placebo caught disease without getting symptoms, that's less likely. hard-core anti vaxxers believe government trying control us microchip, friend one (also flat earther, anti-mask, almost every conspiracy theory brainwashed loves saying everyone's sheep) says Bible warned us mark beast would it. there's alot people believe stuff since YouTube easy way spread miscommunication. even trying find way neice could vaccinated still goto school. Oh talking ass before... figures. Operation Warp Speed SUPER effective!  Calling ""Pfizer vaccine"" somehow like calling Covid-19 ""china virus"". Yes believe said April, enough doses entire population. 

As in, April, aren’t vaccinated; it’s chose be. Life time lol Nope, big excited summer 2021. really want go back office 5 days shit blows over. FML states deaths per capita, what's striking North Dakota bottom 5 measure couple months ago top 8 climbing. anyone know chances WI shutting again? It’s insane everything wide open - especially MN announcing shut downs. Look what's happened. doomsday scenario. Economic meltdown million people died. getting better absolutely horrific next months worst we've seen. getting 5 million Spring population 60 odd million UK body kill virus wont transmit, It’s basic question. expect bunch randoms Reddit tell person brand new vaccine could interact personal medical issues? 100% little changed — article even addresses hazards expecting miraculous reversal fortune vaccine available. still relevant and, nothing else, accomplishes yet another apparent objectives, show us gone wrong avoid future. That’s question lot scientists skeptical trial design well mean airbags throwing shrapnel past two years lot major cars. genuine concern live us be, 70%/0.95 = 74% get vaccine. (approximate numbers) 

But may pockets vaccidiots virus spreads one people goes shop meets one unlucky 5% gets sick, possibly killing them. Yeah, that's like exact mentality warning against. can't produce distribute enough vaccinations beat covid 4 months. rollout vaccine probably take year. guess `BNT162b2` correct term.

Calling ""Pfizer vaccine"" like calling Covid-19 ""china virus"". I’m gonna need months prepare office life anyway.. haven’t worn work pants 8 months lol Know else filters? Fans.

Also cartridge AC ductless unit like asia, filters good. They're dust catchers keep dust fins. merv-13 filter viruses/droplets well. price gouging going Instacart...  wife legit MVPs CDC power state via 6th amendment - look pre-emption.

But CDC need use - power declare national health emergency create national mask mandate federal govt could technically enforce federal agents. Starting sentence “I’m anti-vaxx but...” give red flag you’re say.

If ever gotten vaccine read information vaccine brought public? trust doctor said get vaccine?

I propose fears vaccine publicity around vaccine itself. health experts and/or doctor says get vaccine, trust like before. Covid impending doom, public calamity. everyone take vaccine. literally pass 80% time give blood. thought needle going skin makes knees buckle senses fade. helps look keep telling watch it, comfortable I’ll be. am, 15 years later, still warn nurses 6’5 240 lb man child lay get shots he’ll collapse.  Deliberately exposing people virus called ""challenge trial"". problems it: first, killing test cohort giving others long-term complications! (there's still cure) 

And second, people exposed dose virus catching normal ""in wild"" ways, actually worse measure real-world protection. keep thinking old Chinese curse, ""May live interesting times."" 

Which, learned minute ago, actually [not Chinese curse rather urban myth.   world can’t really wait vaccine takes 5-10 years develop. vaccines people take today developed years ago that’s mRNA wasn’t really considered till Covid-19 hit. I'm interested see degree infection group tested positive true vaccination.

Did merely test positive asymptomatically, mild, serious symptoms?  bit stricter checks please. stock minimum here. seems like another issue people making changes huge gathering still gathering several households. inlaws Thanksgiving Christmas usually huge 30 different households. year 8 households getting together. Much smaller still large  Oh, sorry. forgot things regional!

So live little known place called reality, there’s thing minor inconvenience that’s “a huge pain ass.” Santa....? that?  mean basically doomed. Millions lost incomes going hungry right worldwide. million died. gotten seriously sick. matter. asymptomatic person spreads virus much symptomatic person. cells producing viral protein likely destroyed process immune cells. protein transcribed mRNA presented MHC-1 complexes surface cells producing it, detected immune cells usually destroy cells start multiplying. German science best world -major stroheim Agreed. difficult smaller locations. Insurance companies big decider. charge unvaccinated people, employers want minimize costs may enforce employees. Lmao ""everyone like bigot""

Tell adult Real question. take vaccine percentage chance die covid.  250,000. see climbing maybe 350,000 vaccine given everyone, guess. Slow down? Holidays often busier non holiday times extra cleaning shopping ""has"" done. always wife's family Thanksgiving like 20+ people, we're big get together year. I'll actually get slow time haha. Except I'll probably end putting Christmas lights earlier anyway. wealthy connected people even government anymore like Chris Christie access experimental antibody treatments regular peons don't, can't blame people cynical vaccines. Many also forgotten athletes celebrities able get tested back March/April rest us practically zero access covid testing. “heart disease cancer claimed 655,000 599,000 lives, respectively”
 exponential rate pandemic continues spikes aren’t resolved I’d expect little half way next year, likely July August.  Well, that's numbers meant think suspicious that. immediately thought, though.

They CEO sold stock Monday last week (the sale scheduled back August). want sell stock vaccine trials complete one week later sending price up. So, put ""preliminary"" results least 90% morning trade executed. Otherwise, think Pfizer would've released anything study concluded. entire thing stinks stock manipulation. don’t know vaccines prevent spread disease, trials suggest vaccinated patients don’t develop symptomatic disease misunderstand point. specific numbers, general They've got numbers. They've done math.

This handwaving answer.


And lastly, 40000, total 170 cases. BioNTech idea. Pfizer used knowhow experience take idea market, ramp production get approved. BioNTech, would waiting 2022 get point. Dang. HEALTHCARE WORKERS MUST OBTAIN FIRST DOSAGES STABILIZE SOCIETY!!! fuckin a. nice. thank taking time answer questions. Yeah heart disease perpetually existing disease. It’s leading cause death globally, always top charts. I've watching numbers tick WorldOMeters like kind sick idle game deaths per million globe goes 1.2 day right now. Gives new meaning one million. doubt deaths per day increasing grow faster, long people keep thinking immune carry life usual. Ugh. one's hopes prayers thing, SCIENCE practitioners cleared way saved day. Remember Office Dwight dismissive Deangelo? Deangelo kept trying reason win Dwight kindness respect. work. Then, Deangelo fuckin' screamed Dwight like petulant little child, Dwight suddenly straightened up. need grownup yell anti-mask children tell freedom swing goddamn fists ends face. Similar issues here. Several autoimmune diseases well history adverse reaction flu vaccine. put ICU last time caused arrhythmia. sure I'll eligible covid vacc. Hey fam they’re citizens apparently want guess. end ""morgue overflowing"". never happen young people getting virus. point missing here.

Of course retain restrictions early stages vaccinations. overall risk community drops precipitously vulnerable protected.  Ahh know much allocated US year, also Moderna good news buy UK based company. Came across little conspiratorial think ment COVID would killed everyone bad heart. ""Upset world fucked up? Here, look pretty painting!"" Correct. Maybe Oxford/AZ vaccine substitute, logistically demanding. Lol what? excited vaccinated? Shilling much? you! rough year, we'll get it! :) know. live NYC, outside ‘ground zero’ started get back March. can’t even describe like hearing ambulances 24/7. beyond belief. Unclench cheeks bit... life easier way. Unless making diamonds course. citation/data bullshit? covid, life general. end Christmas, I'm sorry say. problem! cares? April fool m80s!   Nah man, city new cases 6 months. open living normal lives since June people arent little whiny fuckheads give shit well neighbours. many trucks facilities get cold enough keep vaccine expiring? Moderna’s fails pifizers works Im concerned distribution could keep people keeping vaccine quite time. Anyone insight concern? thought ""The chuds subreddit"" dead giveaway. republican controlled government Florida and/or Republican controlled federal government. 

Wonder party voted for. Hopefully one shut work that’s major problem. makes sense way. takes average 5 days even show symptoms it’s average 12 days first symptoms either start getting better (clearing virus) need hospitalisation. guess takes long time body see virus treat produce immune response. lady literal idiot idea talking about. vaccines available everyone least year though It’s it’s tired trope
Edit: also pretty hypocritical... point vaccine things start become normal-ish? Yes! 15th birthday March hope something it! I’m never taking normalcy granted again! think Senate needs get stick work House get next stimulus package passed like Nancy Pelosi wants allow us remain employed shutdown six weeks. trying since July. Can’t wander around hospital. Cafeteria employees only. visitors unless patient minor, birthing dying, cases go patient’s room. leave room done day. super big head? Every time! Alternately: CDC afraid getting pushback incoming political sources. I'm curious vaccination process play out. know 20 year old student I'll one last get vaccinated mind, wonder everybody deal partly vaccinated partly unvaccinated population. Surely first people start getting shots big difference rules likes, point start going again, meeting people, hugging people kissing people? much people either side still follow rules imposed moment within proces? hurt bottom line don't. Corporations people they're beholden different kinds laws. Vaccines cool all.... getting vaccines rest world?
and actually getting believe inject bodies?

just dont hope hard. -used to-, got better. Trying steal limelight incoming administration. curevac claims stores normal fridge Temperatures. trials moment. mean peak deadly wave pandemic things like pandemic started? 👍🏼 I’m saying pandemic bring end social gatherings. definitely won’t. also know people willing go back things like sorting events, concerts movie theaters ends. I’m simply saying people think going traumatized pandemic may choose social life may want work jobs make either work long hours probably require travel time. Tomorrow... Moderna 96 5% 😅😅😅.

Whatever.... work.  Im making fun fact even scientific companies can't help marketing bending numbers. 

If like statistics... change equation.  Obviously never taken statistics... eviction moratorium expires 31st, 2020

after wake covid-19 medicine. long term effects also aren’t fully explored. Rapid accurate testing still good way minimizing damage 5-10% vaccine work. God could asian-style normalization wearing mask sick, would great. Literally read articles, Pfizer initially said test incomplete could see efficacy 90%. article says testing complete data shows it’s 95% effective. well written informative, Sweet Home Chicago pulling you!!! Hey man president working overturn election lost we’re working it. 3-5% actually. yes wont silenced unfortunately think HARD lockdown combined world class contact tracing can’t eliminate outbreak low double digits? handled county county Texas really large. Houston crisis right now, trying avoid it, cities/counties dire straits. Sorry miss it. love doesn’t tell anything effective masks are. sort tells effective wear mask time. useful Like 95% population get vaccine. US would guess 66% want get vaccine, rest think government mind control/nanny state BS refuse even get it. I'm skeptical make much dent community spread. Healthcare workers vulnerable groups ones likely taking precautions already spreading others. among group, jumping line first vaccinate probably cautious people begin with.

The people driving spread younger take fewer precautions. People low-paying in-person jobs can't afford stay home get sick.  Influenza much volatile corona viruses leads influenza basically educated guess strains occur year based hemispheres information, miracle flu vaccines work all. DFW area really breaking sorts record past week. metroplx reporting 2.5k day average, ONE metro. tad bigger Houston metro, TWICE cases day.

It's insane. nonstory based garbage study. results, missing data, variable adherence, patient-reported findings home tests, blinding, assessment whether masks could decrease disease transmission mask wearers others. mean starters.  Wait really ignorant? think economy going shit MASSIVE impact public health death rate? must really young live parents live cushy bubble something. Clearly never dealt poverty true economic anxiety. statistics last lockdowns alone show massive spikes suicides ODs mental health issues. Along medical issues people ignore treat can't want go hospitals. staff treat first place. Thank kind soul. appreciate comforting words. wonderful day! I’m surprised made long Exactly. failure it’s going according plan? Pfizer know value grow trees, right? ability to....sort of, 'do do', per se, directly dependent work someone else.

You know that, right? Good one bruv... wit stupid see even moronic Australian pm lead tiny country mess

Uh, won't, Scumo lead way wet paper bag get say things lockdowns...

It's pretty much states, often chief medical officer rather premier (think governor). Britain: big island, sometimes refers UK.

Ireland: smaller island, sometimes refers Republic Ireland.

Republic Ireland/Eire: country takes Ireland

UK: United Kingdom Britain Northern Ireland, consisting England, Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland. grandmother 90 basically said, “if can’t see
My great grandchildren, love I’m here, might well go now”

So mask give quick hug end. you’re old, lived shit reasonable sensibility things. compare natural occurring organism terrorist attack deliberately performed? stupid comparing Vietnam War like media did. cannot compare that. virus hit nation matter do, infect us. Lockdowns slowed down, masks slowed down, else want do. inevitable. can't control it. happened many times before. hoping experience lifetime. Fortunately, succumb like Spanish Flu. people die converts locked heaven score card. longer live bigger chance renounce nonsense spewed here. really killing followers aggressive negligence good life strategy minds. Death Cults consequences. Reality scary me, it’s scary you, stop projecting. don’t know many fucking times explain you, raw numbers don’t mean shit, matters percentages. idea many people die causes every year? numbers huge, absolutely huge. matters chances one dying this, very, very, low. funeral stocks killing it. Yeah read article, said results incomplete knew least 90% effective. It’s first sentence Moderna... Word vaccine allows fight virus quickly, meantime still replicate enough sheddable; i.e., breathe possibly infect others. exactly pseudoscience. less less issue people get vaccine. Exactly. also virtual stuff shall normalised. zoom dates drinks meals

Just chat family without trying replicate activities suck done virtually family part research study Berkeley measured heritability intelligence take test kid. told could eat half cookie, wait hour get whole cookie. didn’t care cookie, wanted go play, interpreted test mean “if eat half cookie leave instead wasting hour” promptly ate cookie left.


It’s stupid test made wary “IQ tests” experiencing flawed wants help everyone congregation get heaven. many dates yo way vaccine works super, super awesome too! I’m correct one take virus RNA inject us! It’s super neat That’s huge backlash Hidalgo, too, makes sense. People acting like local bar open full capacity life death issue. ordered.... keep immune system recognize proteins foreign, especially body produced them? Good luck MBA! successful friend one instagram entrepreneur pages publish 25 photos Tom Hardy, Jason Statham Elon Musk per day, quotes getting 5am, 'side hustles' dropping school, tell they're bad idea. I've concluded they're probably best idea is. Damn viruses followed natural laws way would’ve allowed us predict prepare wouldn’t happen. Oh wait that’s communism nvm. Oh dear god... Yeah kidding. It’s baffling times like government still takes sweet time everything flocking Florida vacation maskless pretend there's covid.

Where acquire COVID take back home state, counted case instead Florida. Winning! Lol morons listen things. Women control body times. Stay hopeful. I’m actually encouraged Covid stable protein spike makes great target despite mutations far.  seems far less slippery influenza. Yet you’re sitting expecting people exact thing say wouldn’t do, take drivel random Redditor. Hard pass “You're moment. fun. think COVID anymore.""

I mean, ""in moment"" organized whole shenanigan course probably months. Hold one, I'm definitly anti vax! think things go extremly fast vaccine. would guess ""known"" price, lack better term. Hand sanitizer stable price known long time skyrocketed time pandemic. Many states laws price gouging *because* crisis.

Drugs, hand, expensive general probably *technically* violate law jump price response COVID, hurricane, crisis. Wrong either way, technically different.

TLDR: think technical interpretation *why* prices went up, fact prices high they're abusive mother, veeeery little chance abusive child. may physical abuse, control issues manipulation there.

I call bullshit volunteering since wrong police. active problem people trying leave abuse. one largest barriers see. falsely think children abused too.

No one advocating let happen. can't leave either cases. unfortunately lengthy process many.

Nothing I've said archaic like insulting say anything excuse defend ignorance harms. Oh... is... horrible. Ok, make good sense. Thank clearing me. Either way ... fuck cancer. lost far many amazing people life due horrid disease. Curious belief control body extends women well...  goverment providing housing food anyway need it...  hate say feeling Anti-Vaxxers end keeping relevant idiots are, hope I'm wrong feeling. may get detailed explanation post r/covid19. PCR test detects viral particles, presence virus. person actively infected positive result, person longer actively infected live virus yet still dead viral particles body also test positive. recovered person positive PCR virus there, live infectious virus. Therefore person positive, yet sick, contagious. course, one point must trust testing go it. 
The short time frame makes worry. vaccinations tested extremely long time. extremely short. vaccinations delayed deliberately? 
What longterm side effects,do least clue that? makes sense typical process vaccine testing. Getting shot mean instant immunity body need time wire produce antibodies aid COVID infection. Like flu shot, get shot infected flu within week shot time needs help.

So cannot say vaccine effective certain body completed reaction shot. 28 days meant separate may get infected vaccine full effect not.  *Starts* take toll?

What kind psychopath girl's mother raise?  know like everyone take school. 

No, parents signed kids it. way government tends act here.

That’s strange conclusion me, considering (a) less severe Covid-restrictions neighbors, (b) single vaccine mandatory – general vaccination program kids actually recommended (making mandatory currently investigated parliament, however). 

From legal perspective, tell Covid vaccine presently made mandatory. Making would considered bodily rights infringement according EU charter European convention, means permitted exception passing law. turn means parliament properly handle question procedurally, takes quite while. Thank sacrifices  know intrest me, becasue feeling much hope vaccines developed Phizer Mordena, new strain immune those, problems. Yeah still choice live kind life though. often people visit government property? think invasive schools thing tough shit guess home school now. remorse life difficult anti-vax community. think texas would first state leave valid point first mRNA vaccine human history? That’s biggest reason people reservations. safety checks? know complications 1year getting vaccine?   people still get alerts? thought many disabled years. Plus seeing public listening government especially holidays around corner going wait years getting vaccine expect people pay food housing decide ready personally vetted scientists say safe...

I get hesitation find pretty quick something amiss, that's trials for. trials run longer way participants usual right now. time gets you, goes front line workers risk first, know whether safe not.   Unfortunately Trump trying fuck Biden sabotaging somehow seems almost inevitable. Trump major “family annihilator” vibes try take us him. There’s large conspiratorial doomer element sub. 

I would expect sub, taken down, exist many years people unable deal fact virus instead pretend still exists somewhere there’s mass conspiracy make people go spend money something. I’m excited well. I’m healthcare worker well wife, mother, brother wife. wife’s mom also nurse clinical anymore don’t think she’ll included? sure hope so. Either way, it’s going first big step towards getting back normalcy. Makes sense wear mask sore throat sniffles. cost anything basic polite thing do. I'm good health probably wear mask general daily use unless something big coming want stay healthy like wedding holiday. Almost everyone work like this. feel enough. whisk mask moment can. wonder jump back come bounding coughing air. want tell two reasons, one I'm restraining urge hit point. already told many high risk spouse home. People never attempted breathe -30F air idea good feels. Correct, make bad study. point. study clearly states object, setting limitations. Like descent studies do. can't believe scroll far comment. spread novel coronavirus rampant Michigan right now, making every trip grocery store, every visit loved one, risky endeavor. state ranks sixth nationally coronavirus cases fifth number COVID-19 related deaths, said Sarah Lyon-Callo, director Bureau Epidemiology Population Health Michigan Department Health Human Services, citing data last seven days. ""We 10th highest hospitalization rate percent total beds occupied COVID-19 patients, sixth highest number COVID-19 patients ICU (intensive care units)"" nation, said news conference Wednesday, detailing state stands last week alone, state amassed 48,757 new confirmed cases — number took Michigan two months reach start pandemic, state data show. mid-May state accumulated many confirmed COVID-19 cases. far 272,034 Michiganders contracted virus 8,128 died. Yeah there's serious lack perspective. people realize humanity endured previous pandemics. things change lasting way, revert lot old patterns threat passed. paths cross. Ranked choice would far superior, little optimism catching on. uniparty good thing going status quo. last thing they'd let happen competition. knows. unknown long term effects virus that's around less year? possible long term effects scared vaccine ""5G tRAckInG chIPs!!1"" Take really small bit Barbasol rub lenses soft cloth longer visible. stop fog. last day two might again. even mirrors bathroom want fogging shower. Bingo. Feelings mean nothing. Trust scientists. zero benefit releasing unsafe ineffective vaccine. anything would set society back significantly antivax stupidity would really take off.

Part trusting medical science trusting procedures follow determine things safe. How? got married Oct 19, coming together suffered great hardships. union one joy hope love badly wanted share small circle pf friends... care much either make decision put risk. 

So bride me, pastor dear friend stood witness, standing 6 feet away. pastor allowed us drop masks ee may see marrying. Lol.

If things finally get right maybe celebrate friends us wedding beautiful day. 

For two.. kind memories create? Good job joe! already kinda weird/interesting going back reading headlines beginning year covid first starting become major news literally people insisting covid can't mutate dangerous form, immutable.

We're seeing different strains emerge Denmark, Russia, Australia. G strain outcompeted original Wuhan covid.

I shouting void mutations 'experts' keep insisting they're impossible nothing worry about. nonsense. post removed because:

*If believe made mistake, please [message moderators](/message/compose?to=/r/Coronavirus).* Nope, said 90% effectiveness, last test rounded 95%  prefaced saying continue use airbags well vaccines. understand people concerns blanket acceptance they’re told people they’ll never meet. long means vaccine still effective new strain. think there's outside chance might open sometime Q2. Q3 solid bet.  Trust remain relevant, lot people refuse vaccine fall conspiracy theories true. legit approved. Hard see be, yah. Still true. bureaucracy one hell thing data monkeys showed first dose second, monkeys still got infected get much actual damage, way less severe. dosed huge doses though, normal doses people encounter might protected.

The monkeys got super well protected giant viral doses week booster 21 days in. government provide housing food determine safe. thing rushed. I'm okay someone forcing inject something personal will.

Reminds NK I've read so-called experts vaccines use spike proteins immune response may long-lasting ""good"" vaccine, since antibody production likely fade months due immune exposure method. immune, still spread it.

Yeah, measures hands. immune, literally cant spread respiratory droplets. Hence, mask wearing immune people nonsense. fact initial post failed address CUTTER INCIDENT exposed ignorance subject.

You feel need post things know about. People literally deny reality so... saying believe people vaccinated wearing ppe normalize been? see people thinking need wear ppe vaccinated wear causing infections vaccinated unlucky have. point they’re completely different levels, since bunker oil similar burning pile old tires burning A1 jet fuel, kerosene additives. 

Of course it’s extremely toxic, it’s bunker oil.

*Of course* less air travel going better environment, planet literally fire need something.

But doesn’t make two similar all. wow mean magic? President Trump’s Swan Song! 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸 Maybe cases I’m seeing hearing area typical 5 day incubation time. yet county fire breaking records almost every day.  think it’s it’s colder people given up. mention fact hospitalizations saying quick one presented asymptotically.

Something like may interesting development may quickly spread sort inoculate population could actually see drop bad outcomes. Wisconsin legislature feels way. Unfortunately us Wisconsin, they’ve also sued block *governor’s* actions contain it, successfully overturning lockdown. Supreme Court heard arguments overturning mask mandate yesterday. screwed here. ""I believe science!""

""I listen experts!""

""Ehhh I'm feeling kinda iffy whole vaccine deal. Idk, makes uncomfortable.""

Yeah ok. Wait long want, phase 3 trials already done going learn anything Pfizer Moderna already learned. BioNtech take German govt money, Pfizer take public money. *sold* first 100 million doses US govt, that's sale, take investment money US.

Yeah California really good day still bring high numbers. risk dying astronomically low people willing take chance. realistically expects people go long without seeing family? people realize never provided complete protection? still recommend people distance maintain proper hygiene? people understanding? tests known give false positives used recovered patients due viral remnants stay body take time fully removed. mean contagious sick. long term effects people worried about?  That's true. Thanks clarification.  empty planes though  I’m OP. didn’t compare anything. asked poster downvoted. reverse vote please. I’m you. take even slower think dude. got late April 2-3 setbacks high heartrate, trouble catching breath, etc. really 4+ mo later symptoms resided, part helped waaaaaaaay less thought ""help"" recovery along. need rest.  Yes article mentioned ""President-elect Joe Biden’s Covid-19 advisory board member Michael Osterholm emphasized Americans would receive government support case shutdown."" sounds like would require another stimulus bill passed really need reformed. replier right think they're supposed unblind even efficacy trials come out. sometimes wait years They've obesity heart disease lock since 2000s. Irrelevant. Many small nations isolated islands also uncontrolled outbreaks. US countries thing 4 countries did, current surges. Actual enforcement penalties towards individuals would help. goes show redditor dumb wits irl.  don’t even see cops wearing masks. could indicative statistically insignificant results. think LA using tests used 45 cycles detection. That’s absolutely ridiculous. Please inject me! Trump wanted actually anything. pretended everything would fine, held back critical resources Democratic states. he's sulking spiteful.

The president US monarch... thinking people’s reactions widespread vaccination. wouldn’t surprised many people cry receiving vaccine. think they're talking stimulus, shutdown. states can't afford anymore unemployment money. Anything less consistent nationwide regulations doomed failure

Masks like war. little work, use more, right? family “cancelled” thanksgiving. usually go husband’s parents house meet BIL’s family hubby’s uncle wife. huge gathering. rising numbers (and really horrible numbers state), BIL uncle cancelled. It’s much celebration since already quarantine husband’s parents see often feel put everyone ease. Plus, three health care workers, two elderly one heart patient group, it’s probably best.  exactly states begin with. swear never dawned reddit united states America.

A lot people reddit consumers, thinkers, trouble thinking prefer told do.

Being told requires stronger central authority demand happens also.

Which people call communism, got way that's path on. owner class, course. hope COVID finished running rampant USA, Canada Mexico come divide country treat couple thousand survivors dignity compassion. upon time great things like giving world ‘The Team’ ‘Nightrider’ deserve respect matter far they’ve fallen. Goodbye America. one miss you.  Restaurant worker here. 50% capacity alway bullshit restaurant operated 100% capacity minus special day maybe 5-6 time per year. operate 50-60% capacity zero changes. \*so far\*  Every successful country combination capitalism socialism.

There's single country that's capitalist socialist, combination two.

I think ideal situation essentially using one balance other. much capitalism endless corruption wealth consolidation much socialism wind like state-owned media likely way much power hands government sufficient checks.

Weather capitalism socialism better depends entirely one type business running.

You'll see socialism Excel situations servicing region. like power plant hospital can't really build power plants hospitals sake price competition alone. need hospital power plant justify built case capitalism tends suck there's competition capitalism's big pile crap overhead create business really high profit margins low people rush provide consumers options.

In sense trying apply capitalism firefighters police work worth damn. Capitalism public school also really work.

So really take time think application service product made capitalism applies way actually going competition consumer choice going create monopolies.

If going create monopolies better socialism, competition would create much redundancy like competing fire departments, better socialism.

If need strict government control like military, better socialism cases realistic application also still using capitalism. Like even though fire departments socialized taxpayers equipment still made private sector. right example socialism capitalism constantly work together real world.

If watch much TV news might understand that, Even Republican professor taught us political science. countries exist spectrum imagine capitalism one side spectrum socialism everybody falls somewhere middle two extremes.

There's thing all-capitalist country socialist country.

Most importantly there's reason favor one generalized position. proper application excel application produce inferior results, like privately fire departments. tried happens neighbor pay fire department bill house burns house burns whole block burns can't let houses burn they're next other. Taiwan New Zealand islands. New Zealand sparsely populated last mass.

Taiwan benefit taking clearly action due distrust mainland China. 

I’m talking analogous United States size population. Like Europe.

We aren’t going able eliminate covid - it’s widespread, large population numerous dense cities (New York la counties people New Zealand). federalist system doesn’t make unilateral decision making easy real “lockdowns” tolerated. real lockdown basically house arrest martial law (like China) - acceptable states. Yep. State Premiers actually worry people way Scomo. Tons jobs. state ex. deficit 80+ correctional officers, nurses, construction workers, kind jobs. He’s fine. $ = cure. Symptoms normies. COVID made Walmart vs Target experience much, much clearer. California wanted told Trump.

And yet they're uniquely capable everything suggested yet don't

The deepest bluest states armchair experts say federal government do.

People need realize probably even legal cases. I'm taking pants off. folks masks I'm pants. say is: duh. There’s much space, stop bunching together. call 'covid19 divorced'. Hubby exposed moved basement.

He's coughing. hear him. ☹️

And I'm high risk. Soooo high risk.

I'm wearing mask house now. 

We can't get testing unless go ER. There's much demand testing get shut out, they're gone like that.

The worst part...this totally preventable. Hubby's employer needed shit together (they not) people need stay home (most don't).

If die bunch fuckwits I'm going busy haunting lot people descendants eternity. ##noraergrets toilet paper dropped door couple hours 2 clicks, manage election serve term limit way. fact established politician, rather incumbent, always likely win variety reasons.

The times remember getting sick work everyone else gets maybe family. random encounter grocery store whatever... honest, two kids screaming messing everything every minute you’re awake, totally get parents want school reopen. problem people tend look experience status quo worthy position. Putting cap amount terms one serve would solve issue.

As stands we've got folx 30 sometimes 40 years sitting there. One many issues fail represent people get established seats working system rather working constituents. want go welfare? I’ve honestly never heard take. Imagine functional federal government would willing set military field hospitals. 

This doesn’t happen. don’t need leave doctors nurses hanging like this. dual citizen American/Australian: absolutely correct.

Both Federal countries. feature constitution makes healthcare primarily responsibility individual states rather Federal government. Yet difference stark: Australia almost eradicated virus (recently achieved full seven day period zero new cases whole country, despite high levels testing, though there’s flare SA last day two broke streak). US, well, numbers speak themselves.

Public health guidelines restrictions don’t work done ad hoc local regulations. Like, they? county state lock much likes, won’t shit infected people drive 30 mins road, people lockdown drive place fewer restrictions. Things need consistent nationally effect, need combined mandatory quarantine anyone coming country (otherwise problem larger, global level).

States Australia put restrictions appropriate level infection. critically, Federal government ensured response coherent national level, enforced quarantine national border, also provided financial support people lockdown would still get paid and/or lose job. America everyone got one time check equivalent mere two weeks Australian coronavirus payments that’s it. wonder lockdowns didn’t work well - can’t expect people universally cooperate restrictions significant portion can’t put food table. state lines anything curiosity, side effects, any? would ask Dewine seen anyone saying favor this. shut churches might help coward  Laughs Switzerland... good luck fellow sane Americans. comments gave chills sadness, they're eerily correct. like put Trump ignore fact even bluest states done suggest despite technically legally capable so. Oh man, I'll save next Secretary State... bad. Look, there's what? 6? 10? Can't 10 senior officials died watch.  Oh Secretary Interior actually room me? guess looking phone much.. honestly I'll better next one... promise! realize hospital literally this? hiring enough paying enough adequate staffing??? count practically useless 60% positive tests could basically meaningless. Death count need go by.

Even say true, exponential upward trends case counts absolutely meaningful data indicative second wave. A: No...

B: Good Natural Selection private jets strong covid precautions well bet. went high school US, direct correlation bullies/mean girls high school class current covid deniers. mine another social media site, takes restraint post: ""Its REALLY obvious never paid attention science class took school.""

Our education system directly blame covid deniers. allowed bullies mean girls get away are, here. must hit parties. American looks like US government prioritizes economy believes herd immunity. people die important economy, crazy countries like Spain, Italy, UK actually trying still higher deaths per capita. Wtf leaders doing??

Leaders pandemic response managers cost plane tickets hotel rooms nothing compared landing huge sale/contract. 

Whoever still sticking zoom next summer driven competitors meeting person. much business travel actually needed first place given incentive tax write opportunity visit new places? either A: forced retaliation

or B: conditions inside awful moving dead covid bodies $2/hour enticing offer. close businesses, people congregate homes. can’t restrict human behavior - think spring people tried isolate more
But time passed, fatigue don’t think it’ll stop congregating people. realist here. source indicates aerosolized virus spreads 2m poorly ventilated spaces. doesn’t indicate benefit wearing mask outdoors 2m others. Point taken! 👍 recommend watching older videos Dr. Campbell YouTube. [This first video topic. live Ouachita Parish, Louisiana Covid hotspot. talking previous mRNA vaccines? not, that’s bit like comparing oranges apples no? don’t understand gyms shut again. Masks already required capacity already capped. county reached certain threshold sudden inside buildings dangerous? Plus gives anti-mask crowd argument masks effective even though effective!

Gyms much safer indoor dining take mask eat drink. Reinfection wonder thats everyone based strains? insane thing living chronic illness absolutely fuck herd immunity crowd give shit

People higher risk take extra precautions ever covid.

That determine dictate country large do.

The single greatest prevention death since March extra precautions old people especially nursing homes.

That's deaths stayed flat despite significantly cases deaths early days much higher, notably NYC covid tore like fire nursing homes. ""The issue time open virus comes flooding back.""

Tell Thailand, Taiwan, Vietnam New Zealand. lifted lockdowns life relatively normal lives successfully contained virus. laughed, still remove incivility.

We keep notes users post misinformation persistent problem, take corrective actions. That's important people report there's rule-breaking comments -- that's way keep top it! still can’t wrap head around idea companies realizing hugely inflated travel budgets could replaced zoom calls. 2008 rumors didn’t pan out.  No, USA one country. like Germany one country 16. Switzerland 26 countries either. clearly someone inherently understand basic foundation United States America. thoughts. require POTUS sociopath? would argue hardly valid solution. two polarized sides credible evidence valid studies conducted accredited instituions proving disproving severity disease.

When data points strewn place uncertainty foundation narrative, governing powers need careful executing rash violations lives, liberities respective pursuits happiness.

It needs get much worse - least deadly annual death toll medical malpractice - us make sort move.

John Hopkins placed annual death toll medical malpractice somewhere aroind 210,000 annually back 2016, upheaval rights state emergency declared medical condition partially blocks nose. I'm wearing several masks mouth one two nose, know I'm going mouth-breathe much time. could try see helps you. Also wearing face shield. virus kills elderly. know children born diabetic, son premature high risk. know toddlers born heart conditions. 

*Your child’s “development” doesn’t trump children’s lives* Yes. Engines come long way since old 747s... 1. That's going help.
2. Hospitals love money want increase pay, want decrease it. ??? hope ends recovery. Wait mean arbitrary state borders prevent disease spreading?!?  I've living since feb. miserable I'll survive greedy self-destructive. hard time believing functioning financial industry political brains unaware fast bring house down. Maybe giving much credit. 

I feel like must hidden benefit them. Like giving large quantities sub-prime loans seemed like bad move. learn financial instruments invented allow bundle sell huge profit.   got back deli go buy power mega million. saw, keep seeing. 3 guys working there. One behind counter giant plastic sheet, mask. Two others working dick noses hanging out. know stupidity, desire fake wearing mask, like, get it. honestly really dumbest shit keep seeing. bury head sand exercise wishful thinking, ignore evidence proper studies/surveys, anything possible. immune reinfection years instead couple months. also expect live 300 years. Mechanic medical company Plant based. longer wait vaccine worse it’s going get, especially holidays coming up. hasn’t FDA reviewing data Moderna Pfizer? know it’s protocol govt it’s going take another month review data grant EUA. people going die suffer muh state rights Fauci know? mean he's got almost 50 years experience working Public Health Epidemiology, even Facebook page? Hospitals total number beds decreased substantially since 1975 despite population going 216 million 1975 328 million 2019. 1.5 million bed 1975, 924,000 beds 2018. know much decline caused actual reduction bed needs, cost cutting measures. entire system made profit, profit achieved providing care, making much money possible spending least amount money possible. Beat bad next virus far away.

I wish one lethal, nothing everybody... I'm saying would say given know, multi year immunity seems fairly likely. Great news analysis articles. history faking illness order gain sympathy.  Im **letting** fucking anything happen. I’m working god damn ass off. put energy staying healthy job keeps us fed housed.

But I’d delusional look situation objectively say “yeah guys 100% gonna fine”. I’m trying best, that’s literally ask person, yourself. Welcome Mr. Powell June 2020. Love vampire coast campaign. fun outside ikit claw 70 million people already minds made this, ignore mandates, local federal. 

This ever 100% fixed United States. wet mask useless mask anyway particles pass easier. I’m basing I’m seeing Trump since started anti-mask deal. goal keep economy running verbally opposed every idea doctors given. He’s pretty simple understand draw conclusion thinks pretending everything fine wearing masks good business. really smart business person would see thing mentioned Trump talking he’s cause stupidity nation. Lmfao complaining math able maths.... Classic G chuds fair, hate thinking abused kids would trapped abusers schools had/do shutdown. goes children rely school meals. 

Shit...there’s winning.  -	New cases: 10,826
-	In hospital: 7,841 (+373)
-	In ICU: 2,127 (+84)
-	New deaths: 117 remember someone saying response whole antibody drop-off thing, got flamed commenter said: ""oh well I'm expert"" said titre level drop-off extremely disappointing ""yes big deal"". course devolved characterizing guy idiot. 


I wish could find thread could vindicate guy got flamed. obnoxious people get aggressive armchair analysis. think ""expert"" biologist discipline. actually developed serum-stability assays IgG-based therapeutic biochemist, pretend able draw emotional conclusions one-off pieces evidence like that, especially, hound others pointing much.  half lung missing definitely get breath faster breathe harder I'm wearing mask. matter though important wear masks. Gonna wait January. go making sense country hurting special place?  Li Wenliang died went back work next day, went back work literally police visit zero charges arrest made. Try US would fired, even captain carrier.

The fact somehow believed completely made set events happened, really speaks power American propaganda, propaganda went kill 250k Americans.

And way, funny Chinese users able freely share videos waiting rooms ICUs internet, even 250k dead, almost footage American waiting rooms ICUs? Yeah tend happen anyone shares gets fired, HIPAA certainly convenient it? link that? I’m one vocal anti-lockdown mask skeptic people sub, I’ve seen 2023.

Not saying you’re wrong days literally link every claim make otherwise people think exists. Sorry, supposed disappear election Lame Duck Super Spreader U.S. refuses concede. feel like enough people understand one major reasons herd immunity vaccination important, protect can't get vaccinated well people can. agree states rights important sure cases national emergencies, absolutely is, federal government able coordinate effective response good population. starts central level states mandate overrule this.  post removed cannot verify reliable source.

Also covid-19 raging 1/3rd population refuses get vaccinated might get mutation vaccine longer works for. First said “if go home elderly 70 year old parents”

Secondly, realize take precautions, don’t expect everyone cater needs quite frankly, don’t care not. know risks take I’m responsible risks. everyone else turns individualism fucking poison get much it. family rotates. One year us kids spend Christmas in-laws/family next year family. Since parents year mom stressed upset won’t get together. I’m pregnant toddler. I’m go hang family nearly careful are. Plus bunch live FL.... thanks. I’m hoping jump Christmas July see grandkids safely. That's lot paragraphs someone supposedly confident choices. assume anyone wary erosion human rights hands government right wing? smangin xenoblade chronicles: definitive edition lately dirty ass game decent human take need. Nobody needs 200 rolls fucking tp. Would one call karma lift finger help constituents COVID, catch yourself, old dirt likely struggle illness? Great headline. Oh cool bot removes anything sarcastic  saying 50 incompetent governments responsible ducked US right now, one.  No, there’s not. Africa 46k too! 1.3 billion people. government handouts help either. airline industry vital national security investors know it. saying business class help bottom line either, neither would possible without taxpayers padding pockets. Australia whole isn’t current active cluster Adelaide, Queensland I’m sure trust checkout woman give shots Dr. Cox? GOP: pigs fly. never heard bad thing Dolly Parton. Man, eat US would hear plea. That's problem... way many people flat ignore facts believe want. staggering, really. paid low wages get free room, board, medical,etc free tune comfortable middle class wage year. wage get extras commissary. 

Personally, ok prisoners made work productive little money. might teach something, like responsibility work ethics. Though, case, would make exception pay min. wage area. considering there’s two week delay new cases deteriorating hospitalization, imagine much might massively increase coming days.

We first reached 100k daily cases two weeks ago, look now!  Protip: won't. People stupid. Gasp! Tell more! Again, frame right. majority majority. maybe I'm needlessly pedantic ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯ need less tests. Hahaha, interesting goals, I’ll give that! 
Everyone needs hobby. 
You happen want burst watermelons thighs! No, didn't. literally quoted wrote.

I try again, helps you. get ass wore mask chin, \*bring home\* elderly parents, everything could. not.

It's understand spreads via people. refuse take reasonable precautions, likely spreader. know that, willingly choose that's decision make. part problem. also responsible happens actions. people die decided stupid, deaths fault. part chain can't bothered, deaths chain came part fault. Correct mention survivors families face lifelong debt Except across country left leaning states restrictions despite higher populations making seem like cases, proportionally better. that? wonder makes immune strains like cow pox OG vaccine smallpox. Leadership top. Government funding support ppe, testing, etc schools, hospitals, etc. Yup, career fucked.

I can't completely upset it, chances get full time employment hotel next 4 5 years very, slim. get regular spread, rest Australian states going close borders. 

I think whole Australians happy elimination strategy (we small number nut jobs would disagree), grateful victorians handled it. I’m nsw it’d annoying stuck inside 6 days right now, think it’s right response. “wasted”, like “profit MICs”  South Dakota: ""Hold beer."" might missing point, would get vaccinated he's already infected? think county county fair. huge variance outbreak concentrations people get resentful lockdown basically cases. Good feeling going tomorrow suggesting same.  Merry Quanzaccah We’re entering second lockdown. Europe recently went theirs. approx eight day less strict lockdown six days. Thankfully governor cancelled COVID, we're good. Well would say state mandated curfews, masks lockdowns would never reality US. beginning. Agree. would surprised extended community cases found time.

They’re hair pricier.  blame misplaced. Jerome Powell begging Washington approve stimulus Fed won’t cut rates. However, D.C.’s gridlock stimulus spending forced Fed commit 0% next years order save economy.

Powell repeatedly stated stimulus spending preferable rate cuts government power target specific risk groups (e.g. workers service industries, unemployed workers, low income families). contrast, cutting rates less ideal tends create asset bubbles increase income inequality. 

Unfortunately, Powell doesn’t power make fiscal decisions. fate stimulus bill hands Congress. Powell use tools available Fed save economy gets blamed Congressional inaction.  absolute worst kind person. want reiterate said earlier -- virtually chance government China could contain spread owing free movement people international travel. January 2019, know virus already traversed borders months. know first latent cases Italy September 2019 cited today looked myself. articles found pertaining claim dated November 17, 2020. recent knowledge (at least, public sphere.)

(Also, want clear here; hold racist claims blaming China pandemic. Unfounded conspiracy theories things entertain.) accurate. people dense fuck get “knowing” facts rest us don’t. Could time? effect would mean +12M people (eg Healthcare folks want it) would least 1 shot end year? That's big!

I'm looking 275M Americans 12 (what Pfizer tested on). Assume 70% uptake best case, 195M vaccinate, 390M doses. They'll 50M doses americans 12/31 already. today warp director said 'hundreds millions' March.

It's mind bender could literally polarities end year - 10M infections per month simultaneously vaccinating multiples amount. race sorts. state right decide wish navigate various crises even non-crises. everything belong power decision federal level. I’m tired people trotting cherry-picked examples support absurdly impractical policies. guys decked stacked ridiculously favor outset - NZ especially. despite that, Victoria still managed fuck things up.

Countries endemic spread getting zero cases time soon, maybe never. costs even trying would exponentially worse letting virus run rampant, “experts” don’t get shows touch are. see anything linked article stating US deaths hit highest single-day mark since May. 

There's lot interesting stuff linked there, especially update HHS: 1 4 US hospitals nearing capacity ICU beds: Twenty-five percent nation's hospitals 80% intensive care unit beds filled, according internal memo U.S. Department Health Human Services obtained ABC News. Same!! county judge responded ""unfortunate"" attorney general sought ""to gloat instead coming El Paso walk along side mobile morgues"".

Kinda sums up. Canada started 2 week shutdowns many places one said guaranteed 2 weeks seem think. meant reviewed time passed extended rate new cases slowing sufficiently, exactly happened. purpose slow virus turns 2 weeks long enough noticeably slow down, can't see would think would open anyway. use dry ice, - 78 C widely available. son loves book Yea I’d think travel costs nominal compared cost losing business competitors met face face. dumb question know works. vaccine free like vaccines paid pocket insurance? hair husband controls electrician university. Can’t either remotely. feels little weather tonight, nothing would serious regular times right now? We’ve taken temp five times. keep thinking assholes who’ve come get hair done poorly fitting masks, know they’re supposed sip water anybody’s within six feet I’m right behind like I’m person. husband dies wouldn’t able pay mortgage without assholes... don’t know. Wear masks everyone remember service workers humans. We’re one huge shitty city Anyone gotten Covid way point get sort bonus check staying home staying safe contributing spreading virus, felt like throw there. care, could stay status quo, meaning patient might get overlooked late nurses busy another patient. Safe nurse patient ratios good everyone except management shareholder value. Ranger Smith going like this. bout county county. California cesspool certain counties refusing enforce orders. socialist democratically elected. Clay finally got board 7pm evening... Right city council deliberating restrictions. 1/9: Sweden's public health agency worries increase Norway

Oh I'm sure really worried eager strategy validated. cabin WI. call cops drunk keep shoulders. 11\* months.

Trump knew danger January. always guys tested anitobodies ? work retail, 30-40% people coming maskless. enforce supervisors also give shit, someone coming putting mask tell ""That's needed here, enforce it"". like job want quit, also want there. county like 700 total cases 70k population bad yet people feel safe... want stay home play games day til :( want funnel everyone area time. Fuckin Orange County Missouri, still trying convince Governor ANYTHING.

We patchwork city county orders often different restrictions. madness. Anyone know would possible get home anti-body test one day? do. told December. ZERO sympathy anyone complains still going on, choosing things cause continue go on. separation states federal government protect people fact someone medical community speaking something questioned, regardless party. interesting time people cool open 'non binary', yet elect support binary system. Guys, options.  Swear article Pfizer CEO said they’re going request emergency authorization next week hard part people talk realizing won’t receiving vaccine quickly. take months. it’s fast production, supply chain healthcare keep with.

I love good news end sight still miles left run. wanted ded. don’t want risk losing revenue 

No, don’t want risk able pay mortgages feed families psychopaths like want assign house arrest work home. bet business travel 50% it. TP shortage happened once. collectively knowledge happen one wants person TP. looks like shortage everyone experience that, rush get done second shortage hits - turn creates shortage. proposing closing every source food besides grocery stores? can’t stock shelves fast enough one among many logistical nightmares scenario. 

On top “companies” you’re talking would walk away happy they’d much bigger share market due independent businesses assuredly would go bankrupt you’re insane ideas ever became reality.

Your fantasy isn’t reality. also outbreak unknown respiratory illness nursing home July remember correctly list reminds lot Lawrence Kohlberg’s stages moral development. Unfortunately, many folks attain Level 3, Postconventional principled level, universal conscience, reasoning ethics prevail. dont understand, NJ, Gov put limit people indoors. Bars shut 10 pm. Yet weddings “exemption” 150 people allowed? What?! It’s difficult avoid products China. taken look tags clothing? Wait eviction moratorium ends people argue “states rights” every person argues gets pissed states take liberal policies.

Btw case since civil war. Anyone says civil war fought states rights full shit numerous occasions congressmen succeeded states rights slavery legal fought northern states rights recognize fugitive slave free man.  

The states rights crowd always states rights states want views states rights state wants opposite.

We saw worse year states determine want handle covid states say force people wear masks demand federal government take away states rights.  demanded government send jackbooted gestapo punish sanctuary cities.

States rights apply state wants right wing federal law. Problem supposed experts given conflicting guidelines start... Remember masks effective, effective avoid getting it, effective avoid spreading it... change message continually zero credibility.... even need lock lock downs worse trying push lock downs again. often change message likely people going ignore completely. Oh twat! sound brain dead yourself!! I’m hypochondriac I’d always wear little masks doctors offices people looked like plague lol  talking surgically extracting money bureaucrat here. lived apartments almost never delivery food. seems like obvious necessity you, might others. minnesota get free home saliva test state. it’s test person saliva test. zoom call take though. anyone state get free regardless insurance symptoms think I’ve pretty good luck overall. Maybe people noses exposed. I’ve disciplined, work home disciplined like 30-45 minutes time go somewhere big deal. see workers wear mask day mask fatigue sure. Makes war terror Afghanistan Bush completely unnecessary massive overreaction billions dollars wasted. wasn’t talking Covid, taking general.

Liberal talking points Covid seem follow scientists saying That's clever, thank much sharing information, I'll keeping eye well measures seem good surely 6 days way short. Going things went New Zealand I'd thought 14 days would make way sense hard consistent almost country concrete data know spreading. yes, lockdowns could certainly targeted better. That’s opposite places it. Totally flipped. Upside down, etc. Well, does. That’s reality.

You wanna live fairy tale that’s you. 

But 2020, America, political. proof 250k dead Americans lot people still leave house minor cold. common courtesy wear one go you’re sniffling cough. Especially crowded places like subway, planes, trains etc infected people showing minimal symptoms

sounds horrible everything, discouraging irresponsible. facebook spam professional graphics came feed comparing mask wearing sharia law caption ""it's health issue, control"". short someone spent money actually design run ad campaign mask wearing pretty early on. idea getting downvoted. saying correct. Gyms great people’s physical health. everyone sit home day (this sub’s wet dream) actually good physical mental health people

In normal situation, absolutely. pandemic? risks spreading infection far outweigh benefits working public facility.  want look recent European data? So...how many congressional hearings this? got like 7 Benghazi many reinfected? Two? millions? Trumps golf course last 3 days, pathetic leader America woman expected quit job probably settled someone blinded love beginning. could never bring tell wife quit job become live maid. Something weird, daily case numbers low deaths high? changed testing strategy? funny months told virus may provide immunity, may last long heard reinfections. Yet vaccines provide long lasting immunity. Even tests real, highly doubt let's go that...

Germany would okay filming work. would filmed scene hours potential. Still would okay.

But party, probably hour two long, sudden we're going get upset it?

It people things would doing. Good thing is, transmission rate needs 1, far away US right now, nearly vanish.

It matter reducing leisure contacts, epidemic weeks.
If state improves TTI (for example rapid tests every shop), people get vaccinated, contacts increased again. Building relationships people primary goal, plus perk higher end positions. 99.8% chance dying pretty bad.

I think mean 99.8% chance surviving People make poor decisions drink, later they’re open, people drink - hence curfews bars. current rate could hit 400k New Years Day.  No, online advertising actual humans going around signing people that. rally dc nothing. 22 cases put back lock down? Um. ice rinks Phoenix 22 cases never closed haha. Geez, wish nation could responsible face pandemic Kenya central african country high case count except North Africa? type mask hospital given her? Explain Ryanair (no business class many years, still cheap). Actual numbers already exceed 300k, they're probably 330k territory. possible actual US COVID-19 related deaths hit 400k end I’m familiar county, place sucks I’m surprised. Weak argument. I'm sure paying even briefest attention, easy notice trend comments get reported/moderated.


This subreddit's stance politics clearly irrational. opposite expect, vibe I'm getting one inclusion, forgiveness, practicality, scientific rigor. 4 months strict lockdown Victoria ,Australia got daily cases 700+ day zero. zero cases 2 weeks looking like going normal Xmas. People still wearing masks social distancing even though cases though, get outbreaks lock hard fast again. Lockdowns definitely work. hand, existence (cheap) airlines makes people travel more, fuel usage really relevant here. Corporate America entirely problem here. lot wages quite high instantly quashed overpriced student loans, increased tax rates, cost equipment repairs U.S. government allowed right repair. problems easily solved would be. Things tend quite complex difficult.  Good idea. Put eggs one basket. know every decision Federal government makes applied entire country without ill effects. situation hospitals ? capacity ? Neither operate long haul flights premium cabins generate bulk profits. Even Norwegian pioneered low cost long haul “premium” section better seats higher costs. laid-off hotel sales manager, sincerely hope wrong. mom adult. cannot control her, free make decisions, dumb not.

You get mad it, fine. can't control her.

And yes, hypocrite decide want get away Chicago pandemic cry going wedding. unsubscribed r/worldnews  frequent  years.  amount  Sinophobes sickens me. shocker! men finally figuring stay home dad harder going office hanging buds 40+ hours week. 

How many new stay home dad's begging bosses reopen office come winter time? didnt come say think Europe copy Swedens strategy. Thats Europe pretty fucked right now. exactly Michigan doing.

Their rate disease growth unsustainable, hospital system overwhelmed getting quickly. 

You know know healthcare worker? implied they're exhausted. are. Mentally physically. 

Nobody trying eradicate virus lockdowns, nobody ever trying that.

You're egregiously wrong this. I'm sure fine person, I'm guy mean earlier. wrong. imagine medical staff going through... bizarre would feel saving people brought virus believe doesn’t exist? Better overreact know results get rather underreact incur greater risk serious spread, especially vaccine news good clear end game emerging. Countries pursued elimination strategies well end day. Bill Gates special insight here. history previous pandemics tells us humans go back normal quickly.

Take look happened zooms stock Moderna Pfizer news. Think smartest money managers world think ""work home"" stay? great news. wasn’t saying reality lockdowns.

I saying reality changed irrevocably.

The old normal isn’t people getting sick many dying case numbers explode. 

Before COVID people weren’t, new reality people are.

Whether society tries adapt reality lessen sickness death doesn’t mean hasn’t changed.

Humanity adapts overcomes, that’s is, that’s places adapted best best. anyone know Italy getting hit regions (Lombardy) second wave hitting mostly areas escaped first? Voting matters now

Guess what... one main points protesting get people register vote meet pursue collective action. trash. grandpa died covid tonight still wife's family mad I'm bringing wife son big thanks giving planned. told everyone would coming home holidays mother said sister would come us told I'm family ppariah. interested, [here shows cases deaths state, total per million. one coolest graphs I've ever seen. anyone else hear sports announcers calling ""game"" head states moving down? announcer racetrack? me? Perk. Small traditional gift. Nah em.

I’m liberal propaganda ever present media well. bad Fox, bad enough take everything grain salt Virus: ""Tell ya what, I'll give one free hit. take best shot"" Jesus Christ.

You instantly get Covid whenever mask on.

In order get Covid, first come contact someone it. like every single person meet public it. likely, something really, really low.

On top that, even come contact someone it, instantly get it. long masking up, picking nose touching everything store, likely fine. 

I would worry unless shows symptoms. don’t see compliance enforcement laws violate civil liberties, are.

You can’t indefinite state emergency. state supreme courts already ruled this, think us Supreme Court would concur. mean, average age someone dies covid higher life expectancy US. ""only""....but definitely vast majority. car moving, fault damn Democrats Makes sense. nice person! live small progressive town West Coast, surrounding areas amenities there's much conservative population. Many stores latter areas properly enforce mask mandates almost certain disinfect properly. Hopefully close sit resteraunts, schools, churches, workplaces non essential businesses virus easily superspread. also hope slow/stop excessive travel holidays, time virus seems contagious. hotel job small town, allow 4 people lobby, strictly enforce masks deep cleaning. feel could more, though. Closing rooms least 24hrs someone stays could mean different staff member guests losing life COVID. much hope change however, extremely dissapointed handled. Perhaps ability population disperse, ability aid/soldiers travel, critical cargo ? Well Czechia already trending think situation pretty similar French one. think people interested gives better handlevon trends.  I'm American sent $400 US help way another doctor died died Covid-19 catching work. think asthma.

I would starting medical school born. I'm 40s now. financial professional irl i'm cool this. pandemic over, would love travel leisure like Disney, Sports, visiting family. Even though staying home lot boring, make hours live life bit more. welcome working home travelling work less. don’t think huge chunk people would accept reality, matter much want be. might well reading tea leaves consider production capacity rate-limiting step.

If get 35-40% US vaccinated January I'll shit hat eat it.

We need safety data FDA emergency use authorization. need distribution channels setup effective. need Trump fuck way office. need people actually go get vaccine. need 0 safety snags go dosing 10s thousands 10s millions, unlikely. need 2 months shots + 2-3 weeks sure they're effective.

I'm vaccine expert, immunologist worked biotech several years. take longer expecting.

Also worth noting I've never gotten order time Lonza, manufacturer Moderna vaccine. ONCE. Fuck Lonza shitty customer service even shittier ordering service. Honestly better work-life balance debatable many cases. Sometimes feel like can’t get away work “home office” desk nook kitchen living room. interested parables. Interested historical records data.  come Military/VA benefits life. literally signing possible death sentence save country, not? Possibly, might likely dog owners likely going things like taking dogs walk, dog play dates dog events like agility things do. could totally united Donald Trump actually recommended masks suggested social distancing start. 

Instead fucking worried looking bad tried make democrats look bad possible turned public safety issue political identity statement. 

Its 100% terrible leadership. People dumb research always thing. always look leaders guidance. There's nothing wrong looking leadership answers. way specialized labor. time leader said democrats making look bad fault.. ate shit people dug deep defend egos. Nobody wants admit supported shitty candidate. Fuck trump bad him. yeah, would need people actually fine people wearing mask. literal stories hospital incubated continue say COVID 19 biggest hoax ever. 

They longer accept facts. feelings narrative others said fractured nature states. Also, value individual freedoms rights basically country earth. love aspect country, dealing something collective pandemic, attitude hard mesh could considered ""best"" policy maximally reduce deaths / cases. 

Extreme example best solution pandemic truly wanted halt cases lock people houses patrol streets military month. That's basically China would obviously never allowed country like US built idea distrust national powerful government. There’s always new bottom. sub pretty sassy now.

Does anyone know mortality rate 85+ year olds? Asking friend.

Who direct contact quarantine? Pfizer. Keeping alive keep :) Each? Good, hope they're mandatory stop covid thing thier tracks.  Things trending towards 9/11 per day. can't comprehend callousness displayed something simple social distance wear mask. Pleading people's humanity seem working showing compassion political somehow. submit complaint employeer? Im tired enforcing masks customers fellow employees refuse wear masks. Theyre going listen me. much eliminating virus done it. juggling lockdowns inevitable vaccine starts rolling out. Probably right strategy save lot lives sub stupid thinking Australia could go back normal lives. Probably long? know India ""rich"" US Western Europe (you know mean) understand tons production set something like this? song 9 5 featured episode Orville tv show. Hearing Dolly first time, shocked alien says something like, ""That woman sings voice thousand warriors."".  literally heard January 3 meme Stephen King sub know tough living house someone sick. even afraid personally getting sick, hearing constant coughing whatever, kinda annoying. know bad term ok selfish thoughts.

Most people probably lived someone truly sick before, understand. think I’m trying “dox” you?

I’m sorry family died this. puts context response.

I think step back would see possible negative repercussions intense government intervention. agree needed happen

Why? need happen?

We're talking probably openly politically hypocritical thing that's happened last hundred years so. still support Republicans also admit flat wrong. Personally, believe wrong first time time - say, President nominates Senate vote basically immediately. Mcconnell Obama/Garland, wrong Trump. 

The election's over, really ok acknowledge wrongness it. seem think reality things used like.

Reality changed COVID. was/is vaccine we’d still live new reality society would need adjust...because old reality currently country shit creek without paddle. Supreme Court they’d definitely get tossed (that’s “advisories” everywhere!) recall correctly exceptions baked laws national crises public health reasons.

Also state federal governments break law time. really wanted to, anyway. would go away November 3 course Can’t win. I’ll wake -5 tomorrow morning. sub even moderated days? fair know lots couples share childcare/household duties. end childcare duties, surely that’s reflection laziness man married - accepting - rather done vast structural inequality? Face already, pandemic going murderfuck us, precious freedom founding fathers bestowed upon us, main reason killing us right now.

The freedom choose whether put mask (Which stupid people comply btw, hold intrinsic value human lack empathy fucking use one now.) sole cause this.

I bet ass, even vaccine widely available there's still going vast percentage population choose get shot ""safety"". think that. especially people 25 so, they've basically smart phones entire life, never moment life without instant gratification. real struggles, stay inside nothing weeks. can't shit months years. freedom ""choose"" dear leader two candidates every 4 years, 15 times lifetime. Glad i'm one read voice, lol yeah, where's covidbucks!? Jesus, people really stupid? get elected statewide office. 🤦‍♂️ 22 cases? Pffft, that’s nothin! odd [Camel great system people profiting it. what’s stop stocking alcohol house party? Trying play devil’s advocate here. 

People gonna find ways around you’re accomplishing anything. 

I’ve seen quote times altho think I’m paraphrasing:

“The easiest way create criminals outlawing everyday activities.”

Prohibition didn’t exactly work well. Neither this. puts North Dakota 9th place Covid deaths per capita. get mad option, I've never atm default English US, option another language... Pretty much. Non-emergency procedures get delayed. short answer COVID influence severity health issues reducing quality care. Trillions America ranked Vietnam terms quality education provided.

You're definite product effort. see post coronavirus UK sub Poland positive test rate 36% start November. also lowest number tests per 100k population anywhere Europe.  says top rate 3%. rate 10% indicates little testing identify cases. Looks tough situation. gets guys wear mask using authoritarianism excuse basically proving authoritarians point. public health worker, don’t know that’s true that’s pretty asshole thing say. possible father it. Pandemics don’t happen abruptly. around lot longer FIRST reported case.

Stop dipshit. get bonuses hazard pay. governor turns around passes law free tuition frontline workers, ones without degrees. respiratory therapist whose professional organisation pushing market hire candidates bachelors, could helped elevate career. I'm happy they're people may access college dealt public, holy shit hard feel sting I'm going rooms 50x day clustered care thing anymore. I'm burned sad.  Survival rate highly dependent age. think median age coronavirus deaths US average life expectancy. 99.8% survival rate accurate looking people 70, makes 90% US population. 10% population (70+) survival rate dips statistically. see, wont we? cuz avengers ain't gonna save think blame COVID. I’m sure it’s fucking shit working front line treated like shit everyone whilst working front line global pandemic. 

Your victim blaming. one blames old soldiers PTSD drinking, don’t blame nurses. think virus travels land? stop them, ask, hope slip literally comment. work hard ridiculous natural? People convinced coronavirus epidemic hoax: supposed purpose hoax world's governments scientists allegedly gain ""colluding"" it?  Seeing country's economy tank watch, masses people dying, sizeable proportion citizens distressed enraged jobs businesses go belly-up strike outcomes governments would seek without hell reward. conspiracy theorists claim pot gold driving mayhem? I've yet hear motive, let alone credible one. Exactly problem shit is. politicians celebrities telling us important quarantine social distance, meanwhile afford around clock testing don’t even know it’s like rest population. thing happened me. traveling around lot airports got sick November. taught 911 happened planes crashed old folk homes people would say, ""well way "" bars open late would help reduce infections, although bars open would better. open late stops second shift people heading bars work, nothing better getting work late day. yes, first shift people go bars work experience, working bar time youth spent bars, even remotely busy first shift people. Bars generally start pick 9-10pm pretty packed close. Wow things must shit desperate. covid free workers teams? assume separate toilets eating facilities etc? feel like people say call system authoritarian without realizing system prevents are. Remember people asking really think it'll take ""a whole two weeks?!"" Costco sells one $120

I saw weekend shocked average age plane service around 15 years though, since plenty new planes service must also plenty older ones too. COVID? several COVIDs past years. last one 2015ish MERS. Solving big conflict getting big commitment also near impossible online. It’s okay things going well, need alignment multiple teams execs, it’s ass chair time. americans, I'm guessing guy talking about. almost quarter died 'accident', kind weird.

Yes, right every week see 60k dead right now. Covid 5 times worse vietnam, quite 1 week vietnam, like every week 3 9-11s...or, republican, every week 1300x bad Benghazi. Yeah probably, zoom 95% scenarios?  Tf even talking about?

I wear mask everywhere go. isn’t me. Australia quite bit simpler though, since 7 states (and territories) population lives three. can't see applies.

You want data? Look happened France tried increase taxes. house energy efficient geothermal. I’m wfh currently hope keep way cut commuting. reading Band Played On, American CDC shitty shitty job stop AIDS spread. thought, uhh, USA. must improved many decades.  
 
I guess not. like guy stop developing cult around one person? people fake says word God. surprised see collapse private profit healthcare industry winter There's need prove negative. do. 

You live country founded flourished system established.

There's reason US far immigration requests country planet.... sell both? assumption, quite unique Sweden, herd immunity closer turned be. idea abandoned late summer, antibody surveys showed population immunity way lower earlier mathematical models predicted.

This illustrates timeline nicely: Covid October,recovered 2 weeks. Luckily experience stamina even better expected spent whole month one room.But drink alcohol experience faster heart beat usual. [selling oregano weed, Eventually health workers going stop showing work. Probably none. time people afford travel again, nothing left travel to.  Reminds back weeks going remote, one monitors displaying 1point3acres.com tracker going times, set browser auto-refresh. quickly went from, ""Oh news"" ""Oh big news"" ""Oh going big election."" ""Oh... world going same.""

Hell, remember even conversations April people still thought things going blow end month people thought would culture changing doomers.

And now. initial model wrong assumed states would lockdown within week, happen. agree 100%. pandemic like 9/11 though.

I can't imagine mental gymnastics happening correlate government response terrorist attack vs. public health crisis. get back protecting time stone. That's said. live south China went travel Jan. 25th. atmosphere already anxious. hear mask took HSR. Wasn’t Wuhan lockdown realize that’s wise decision. oh no! anyway Every office company know preparing work home stay. new perk offer staff. already drawing new policies deciding equipment buy everyone WFH. full time WFH mixed, come meetings etc.

I wish knew more. would love know percent ages died. 

Like percentage 40s, 50s, 60s, etc. It’s clearly listening well enough:

“In autumn second wave. Sweden high level immunity number cases probably quite low,” Mr Tegnell told Financial Times. “But Finland low level immunity. Finland go complete lockdown again?” viser også til antallet immune respektive land spiller en rolle ved en andre bølge, og Sverige har flere som er immune enn Norge.” argues immunity least part responsible sharp recent drop Swedish cases questions neighbors fare without it. “What protecting Copenhagen today? see,” adds.” Yup, deaths numbers still bad obviously, cases numbers promising 14k. Positivity rate still high 16%, trending too. Jersey Shore  Dude, look hurt butts. Lol. know... Yeah population fatality rates case fatality rates lot people can't seem tell difference Nooooo stop scary continue lie. little bit insane. Today homes hoax begin with, that’s they’re Yeah serfs wouldnt like that. Welcome 9th month three weeks bend curve expand constitution bit, understand mean... Go Queensland! Awesome win tonight!  must go around looking arguments, looks like they’re trying discussion you’re worried ego. proposal react way matter virus kills people life expectancy 10 year olds? experts say expectations misplaced. start, figuring what’s needed achieve herd immunity COVID-19 vaccines involves range factors, several unknown.

**REPRODUCTION RATE CRUCIAL**

Central public health calculations concept COVID-19 reproduction rate, R value, virus causes it. Assuming complete vaccine efficacy, herd immunity percentage thresholds infectious diseases calculated dividing 1 R value, deducting result 1, multiplying 100. instance, herd immunity highly contagious measles, estimated R value 12 higher, kick 92% within group immune. Additionally, anything less 100% vaccine efficacy - 90% suggested early data Pfizer-BioNTech Moderna COVID-19 shots - would require matching rise percentage coverage reach herd threshold.

Amesh Adalja, scholar Johns Hopkins Center Health Security, said good target immunity United States would 70% population inoculated, added figure could go vaccines less effective.

**FOCUS PROTECTING VULNERABLE?**

Edinburgh’s Riley said suggests now, pursuing idea herd immunity COVID-19 vaccination fruitless.

A better approach, said, could ""turn herd immunity head"", use first limited supplies vaccines protect need, without worrying robust members ""herd"" live relatively happily virus.

""Let’s forget protecting masses protect vulnerable,"" said. ""Let’s directly protect vulnerable."" downvoted? Looking back, smartest plan. Long commuter here.

Not bad thing, personally liked old way. like changes :D live near city, go corner stores. stores tourist areas, residents shop. always toilet paper never problem finding it.

The big name stores suburbs ones running out. proposal deduct deaths consider insufficiently tragic statistics? Nevermind obesity risk factor bad covid, addition huge burden health care system itself. immunity lasts eight months think found here. ever found Life expectancy logic Well, think planet populated virus even scratch it. seem implying people protest anything avoid curfew. play metal band played show metal club Trenton, NJ.

It’s hard (for least) put one’s self mindset heart. basically wants go hospital better prison. Airlines scrambling prepare ultra-cold shipping storage facilities transport COVID-19 vaccines developed Pfizer Moderna, whose doses, require deep freezing, likely among first distributed.

A recent survey air cargo association drug shippers' group found 15% industry participants felt ready transport goods near minus 70 degrees Celsius (-94°F) required Pfizer Inc PFE.N vaccine, around 60% could meet Moderna Inc's MRNA.O less stringent -20°C requirement.

Typically, airlines use containers cooling materials dry ice transport pharmaceutical products, don’t temperature controls, making products susceptible unforeseen events flight delays.

Airlines considering options ranging large plug-in freezer cost much small car multi-layered canister uses liquid nitrogen ship vaccines requiring deep freeze. There's 0 evidence anything said here. Another redditor cited stuff you. read it. No, it’s going take 9 months vaccines alone even bring partial herd immunity.

BUT vaccines conjunction +100 million people recovered viirus end March mean US wind back Spring 2021. Paired actual federal response masks, testing, tracing workplace safety help us turn corner. God help us next four months Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Years, Super Bowl, cold weather 70 million people believing it’s hoax.  get flu every year never notice side effects. heard e experience brief period fever fatigue. sounds better playing Russian roulette hoping suffer significantly covid.

Wildcat strike!  Triggered? I’d argue better choice word “revealed”. Australia managed basically eliminate flu year.

Proof no. 1: no. 2: huge difference 15 percent tests coming back + vs 50. fucker place since beginning. friend one, lot people pick calls return calls, lot people get nervous going fine going gathering (illegal otherwise) lie, try reassure job law enforcement, want keep people safe, going get people trouble (as long true course, know things work region). Knowing process get tested also helpful people ask. Best luck! Depends airline country you’re flying to. I’ve known several people couldn’t get flights lost several thousand dollars simply wasn’t PCR test.  shit. Kill economy kill virus. You’re trying downplay pandemic showing small number. It’s much there’s thing called exponential growth. Could since Poland, Czech Republic many others eastern Europe low numbers Spring, virus ripping apart society way Italy/Spain march April? 1 1000 0,1%. I‘m sure offensive worthy downvotes.  thought COVID bad, wait airports runways can’t use it’s hot (see Phoenix couple years ago....).

You argue needing travel want, it’s literally unsustainable point need stop imagining constant growth forever state. tried blame yellow Chinese people spreading virus. Yet ironic twist yellow Chinese able get virus control resorted denying virus. always thought FDA requirement, actual active ingredients degrade. They've closet room temperature. wish Camacho president right now. Camacho found smartest guy let job. tad bit complicated speaking jive. Everyone thread idiot, including commenting Like president biden said need another lockdown 4-8 weeks. american seems pretty high. Quick googling shows death rate less 9 thousand every year lower death rate implying. get 1 80 from? need time divest stocks going tank 
While come people working wearing masks time.  *One word: __impunity__* words bars clubs far worst place setting long reaching infection chains. exactly shocker plenty people don’t seem believe it. 
Press release study found here. Point digging Mass Graves. People take notice behavior Lock change I’m posting Tegnells words. It’s fact - proven fact - Tegnell argued Sweden would fare better neighbouring countries long run herd immunity. 

It also fact since April it’s claimed herd immunity would around corner Sweden. Tegnell himself, mentor hired consultant Giesecke, boss Carlson experts authorities cooperated closely Albers Britton. :( sad hope people come together like white People racist hateful willing die preserve last embers white supremacy He's republican Vermont, he'd likely dem state Yeah, that's started aggressive tracing lockdown. react deaths instead infection almost 2 weeks late. Closing public places locally infections start rise means virus get everywhere dies get to. react early, act harsher longer.
If see wild fire, wait reach tree, trying put out. insist waiting reaches tree, throw one bucket water it, would worked first saw it, state ""see water work fire already everywhere reaching trees anyway"". stopping spread virus, dolt. 

More mask = less spread = shorter lockdown = better economy

It's easier you? study summer found 10% people infected. Early large fraction cases went undetected. 

Now guess would 40-75 million now. 13-20% .  Yuck.... eat organic non-diseased grandmas Get ready protests.  (Not lockdown... sort social justice)...

I hope take boards business. Could agree more. call “a-holes” , call “lemmings”.  test negative would likely roommate simply infect you. Household transmission rate much lower people imagine, around 10%-20% people, around 30% spouses, roommates lower end. See Table 3 positives rare, studies estimate around 1%. Karnataka, social distancing completely gone public transportation/shops/restaurants. one even offers sanitizing/keeps logs enters restaurants anymore. quite stupid, think anyone goes testing anymore. yeah turns never people cared buildings, apparently sound like separated people different groups much mask wearing distancing might done walking dogs. whether getting grocery delivery. stopped gossip fellow dog walkers delivery person kind throws data garbage can. It’s funny seeing people absolutely refusing anything virus get shocked restrictions/closures proceeded with. 

Like... expect? Actions consequences. wonderful news … per dose inoculation cost patient, paying ? wait month find answer law school note haha.

TL;DR emergency measures pandemic fall separate statute regular vaccines, regular vaccine law takes long.

That said, argue forced go regular law fairly quickly approval vaccine injury compensation fund applies That's literally governor New York did. worries wealthy able get vaccine first leaving less really need it. like testing began. definitely told everyone getting tested. 

The dog essentially surface, risk surfaces low, see ""The estimated risk infection touching contaminated surface low (less 5 10,000), suggesting fomites play minimal role SARS-CoV-2 community transmission."" call phase 3b fuck buys groceries 10pm? Dog walkers frequently careless pandemic. Letting others pet dog may COVID, get COVID dog, pet dog later, stick finger nose. Right? get trying force people back work without spending money safety. seen that. 

But endgame forcing people stay home lose job? government conspiracy, get consumer spending tax income. may true, think statistic tells full story. I've seen people using statistic insinuate shows people dead COVID long live anyway. thing is, many may quite healthy age still many years left. average death rate gets pulled every accident, heart attack, cancer, infant/young child death, etc. average life expectancy U.S. 78 years old. That's really old - Biden 78 Trump 74. make past obstacles, there's reason person able live well 80s 90s. True. pros cons many forms government. China responded well, mean I'd want live country party loyalty social credit scores threat prison wrongthink. 

As poorly system performed pandemic, still prefer absolutely stronger Federal government. prefer states retain much authority prefer counties municipals also autonomy. Local governance preferred top control afar. Locales want deal effectively pandemic hat won't. thing would say adopted travel restrictions permissible states. Then, states well could prevent travel not. They're blaming China. get COVID...the COVID gets Thank everything you’ve done. deeply appreciate guys. I'm still wondering flu pandemic 2018 individualism dog eat dog world gets us. used pride downfall. awful say, folks really need get caned. basing on? Yes, yes, YES! folks enabled Trump first place! They're mad finally realized can't control monster helped create. 

Tactically, useful play nice election, let's pretend they're better Yammites (cult members Danger Yam): they're savvy enough say quiet parts loud. many people met life either Dakota?  Well, you?

A SCIENTIST TOILED HARD almost guarantee things life effect road vaccine continue ignorant.  Williams said 93 percent staff contracted virus community, majority contracted virus work eating break room mask off.

So, breaking … ~800-820 contracted outside workplace (presumably) remaining ~80-100 work, half break room eating. personal recollection break rooms used multiple people typically, makes person-person community transmission, break room, probably chatting co-worker. least co-workers carried outside workplace.

This, least me, underscores importance masks limit transmission. I've told people many times, I'm beginning get message fatigue. dosen't matter, half country loves leaders hide, fall apart, become unhinged, etc. True, NY got slammed US conducting 500 tests per day. clue going on, good treatments, tons things would never now. 

ND writing wall 6 weeks daily infection rates well 25/100K actively chose ignore nothing. don’t mind asking do? Recent college grad admin city Yes. And, people pretend they’re taking seriously yet shocked clusters like occur. They’ll wear masks, take lean group picture. Or, hold event outdoors forgo masks absolute utter disbelief virus spreads “took precautions”. They’ll hear infected person event, get tested day exposure, claim can’t possibly virus tested negative refuse isolate.  even without oxford. Oh babyy  Username checks out. U.S vaccine fortified common sense ,and bleeding obvious ... It’s fool’s errand putting restrictions place anyway there’s relief coming protect people businesses lack income shutdown. It’s either work potentially get sick, lose home. That’s part reason people complying, it’s reality don’t want face.

They don’t give fuck us they’ll evict us thousands die everyday. Borderline genocidal shit. answer yes no? Let’s see establish common ground first. I’ve lived lockdown that’s eliminated COVID wave. way covid’s coming back Victoria outside source Reduced density definitely slows pandemic ultimately people. 1918 absolutely trouble hitting everywhere much less dense world. flu far incapacitating shorter incubation period asymptomatic annoyed carriers.

Being almost entirely rural (with transport faster horse) course never stopped smallpox plague. Wow. Maybe get rid Trump get well made, credible PSAs made get media. reach ones level paranoia, may help counter misinformation average viewer. I’m sure find another dime store mini Trump run state doesn’t turn soon. [Eliminating COVID-19 false hope] Australian Deputy Chief Medical Officer.

It's literally policy so, rather pursue suppression local elimination tends mean punctuated pauses virus lifts head again.

News showing crowded hospitals, starving kids, war torn cities, pleas doctors everyday every news station makes super easy ignore what's happening bc see it. Montreal. rest province felt city problem . hard understand see water side boat yet, boat actually sinking. total covid death count day two NY
Not sure think even compare? want treat way treated 55 million people died 2015. less cryptic- calling “obstinate a-holes” refuse take precautions seriously “lemmings”. see danger.

Article week ER nurse watched several patients die Covid-19 insisting real. no, can't see it. None says ‘new normal’ *depends* vaccines, certainly doesn’t suggest don’t *want* vaccine. Frankly, many areas, horse bolted ""Here’s another person. starts take toll you,” Mikayla Bishop said.""

Oh no. feel so, sorry you. horse bolted US Biden comes admin decides take measures... needs go steps simple terms got extreme measures.

Also side side comparisons countries allies show far gone US is. ""We used tell allies could trust us, we're best do.... "" - ""The GOP screamed ',Make America great again' legacy going put right"" 


Shame shit America crisis GOP gov company failed get memo. 

“Your ticket cheapest option.” 
“Yeah, know, flight 4 layovers Boston LA takes 36 hours saves $10.” 
“Book it!” 
“But time... thirty extra hours”  
“Oh, get miles airline.”

We realized draconian measures place specifically discourage travel first place. 
It worked. 
COVID concrete fully sealed casket. unless someone love dies, won’t take seriously Internal lockdowns may always eliminate COVID permanentlyand need stop pretending do. Lockdowns meant stop outbreaks even may always necessary, look China's recent outbreak handled compare one. hurts much. lost grandma year Covid. fallout family member faulted saying matter dying anyways.

I hope go many us gone through. say goodbye her. wave goddamn window sedated kept pulling oxygen out.

I hate courage look window. stood everyone else front trying get realize there.

Sorry unloading. just, hurts seeing many people able care this. Good, be. every person vaccinated one less host virus spread through. HCWs spend time potential hosts it. Floridian, surprise Victoria mandated mask wearing everywhere home. lot measures.

What US patchy inconsistent comparison, places wore mask early like SF far less cases.

And course masks dont work alone, 1% effect R0. 

Not randomised study irrelevant - real implementations mask mandates real world studied show work comparison regions without mandates. months now. ...yet. People truly rational animals. make decisions based prior experiences post-rationalize decision made. want people make better decisions, change way FEEL. Ask help saving community. dumb rednecks voted Republicans. Every city FL blue. folks pretty damn quite year. angry irresponsible. fundamentally misunderstand america. federal system, people. Based cities reached herd immunity India Mumbai Pune PFR seems around 0.14 per cent sound fun. Even though around 80% people support masks Republican leaders scared fringe extreme willing throw us bus. Truly pathetic sad part probably re-elected. heard he's looting!!! /s stop ingesting scraped cowpox?

But seriously, examples vaccines effectively tested using phase trials side effects noted modern vaccines complete phase three trials. 

Even 1 100,000 serve reaction make 4 times safer virus lowest risk cohorts (death).  taxation without representation, amirite? going really bad winter. Well know! like home pregnancy test. choose believe me, try convince you.  Inauguration Day. deserve it!! Thank you’ve doing! who’s rounding nearest 99.999%? moms ex husband bunch veterans died coronavirus. bikers went Sturgis slap POW MIA flags surface take break drinking actual veterans war live long life. might know someone, family saying died ""a lung infection"" admit elaberate exactly except ""she old, things happen"". can't prove instance, know another family admit family member death covid death hoax. Sigh... ultra-cold crap again. Dry ice costs nothing gives - 78 C temperature days styrofoam box.

The media inventing problem exist.  average healthy human harbors 5  almost belongs u/trashy least NY isn’t resisting every measure like “bUt FrEeDoMs” think people would take seriously could use stupid guns agains  reliable study, previously said Good points. shame. daily new cases state single digits.

sorry masks permanent feature me. support cause right now, there’s vaccine community transmission nearly nonexistent longer responsibility wear one.

the next time i’ll put one i’m sick nope wearing precaution point.

it’s literally anti-human nature wear mask. rely heavily non-verbal communication masks negate large portion that. “Overall.” Right super super bad. point post? “Overall” isn’t really helpful RIGHT NOW. RIGHT Wisconsin getting slammed hard you’re making seem like things fine. You’re wrong bright. don’t motive you’re stupid way present information. Source? believe 99% people does. Javascript java.  already default. Look around tell fine rethink approach public health. Damn. 50 years went together. someone 7 years marriage, that’s inspiring. public respond ignoring doctor celebrate holiday. Americans part done virus even virus done Blows mind people would pay limitations people without vaccine do, guarantee religious people would call mark beast. like US needed pass another stimulus keep us afloat. believe Biden president vaccine, whichever first. think I’m right think you’re right whatever Antivaxxers amazingly split left-right dichotomy. Tons liberals it. Bars opened indoor patrons last weekend. mid-September, opened to-go drinks only.

As said, closed summer. leave call police, anything else bs North american culture (before covid) lax sick people going work. think people acknowledged best stay home, really encourage people so. hope changes. One good things might stick around covid.

When younger worked Starbucks. remember sick policy well. responsible finding someone cover shift - could find someone, come in. could find someone cover shift come in, matter sick were, grounds dismissal. simply get help encouragement stay home. sick pay, encouragement stay home. find someone cover it, come anyway even puking guts out.

It made uncomfortable. feel right serving people sick. literally choice. you, I'll me. Would love see wife also get since lung disease Oxford long term debilitating effects, unlike others rushed. traveled extensively January year plane since. over, desire go back kind life. I’ll still travel bit, every week/other week was. sure female male fertility? test getting vaccinated? Thank u wishing that. Please wear mask, social distance worry I’m right. Stay indoors  Oh yea! Well Pfizer 96.2% effective works even faster put little flame decals bottle! They're bother mRNA based, know means differ. feel comment hard. 

I mean, way seems like much easier isn’t. Frustrating af. keep saying see people talking it; it’s discussed like convince people government mandate it. 

But actually happen want job therefore money therefore survive; need get vaccine. Sheer corporate power actually something good once. ""have real thing"" also infect others, risk death organ damage, suffer effect ""the real thing"" gets you. vaccine worry that. think common sense vaccines better, you.

What idiotic response. real thing always better CREATING IMMUNITY.

There thing called CONTEXT need learn about, NPC. consider volunteer test safety vaccine then. 36 cases matter. whole state South Australia locking objectively invalidates ""everything back normal"". eliminated virus, still need restrictions everything back normal. Read comment admit wrong. addressed issue mhra uk needing ai system severe amount adverse reactions they're expecting?  found, flu vaccine 39% effective: might misinterpreting since I'm immunologist, seems like 95% high. Also flu vaccine, people still get flu usually get milder symptoms “When debate lost, slander becomes tool loser” -Socrates guess still Number One! Whoops. Let change that. Thanks! Makes nervous. vaccine hasnt tested nearly enough. Could totally back firr get something worse mutated. Can’t wait sub irrelevant. mean best way Telecast fireplace optional christmas music tv dinner pros Good news!! aren‘t vaccines tested 10 years make sure it‘s safe it‘s available public? (have clue) Convenient, cheating need clean test return work on? 

What's keep someone handing 90 year old Grandma left home/had visitors since March get past it? similar ways get around it. People find loopholes like take advantage, rendering whole idea useless. Yes, asshole bosses aren’t. Partner, heart right place, staying home realistic ask huge segment American population things currently stand. wish case.  Don’t seem care tuberculosis though huh mean won? I'll swim current argue that, even study incomplete flawed, important assume anything virus perform research necessary validate assumptions.

The issue reporting study like this. Newspapers used dedicated ""science"" writers understood research process knew type questions ask make sure full story presented readers. everyone's chasing click-bait headlines writing synopsis, regardless whether training knowledge parse themselves.

The solution never avoid research; vital toward advancing knowledge. establish criteria research released public consumption.  Kids might list mortality rate less severe. need focus vulnerable first. teach children equivocating refusing service antivaxxers segregation? Well administration change coming shocked free, mean fluvaccine free 99% insurances worst $40 Everywhere US, everywhere world. 

Densely populated cities like Singapore Hong Kong mandatory mask-wearing, travel restrictions/quarantine requirements safe distancing measures resurging local infection. Australia New Zealand situation pretty good control too. like big newspapers advertise links ehre increase ad revenue substantially... That's true. believe 1 100,000 people suffered side effect people started suffering effects weeks vaccinated, months/years it’s actually good article then? Thanks heads up! previous shortage panic, I'm annoyed nobody seems learned lesson. There's plenty toilet paper, there's shortage, need *not stockpile it* plenty everyone. vaccine released doesn’t mean it’s over. might provide immunity everyone right? That's said need laws making forgeries felonies, otherwise faked. That’s study shows all. Misleading title Passes checks? Havn't testing days/week? they’ll get stealth bailout rest us starve waiting stimulus. Supreme COurt already upheld mandatory vaccines. think case fined people get vaccine. Schools make mandatory too. Next August, lot blowdart work. Turn Java actually part 5% respond Hepatitis B vaccine. found 2 decades later got titers checked. That's herd immunity for! two results right live vaccines vaccinated 29k people, 15k people came given shots nothing it. people went lives caught Covid, they’d come trial runners would mark “patient 2264 caught COVID”

When got 170 cases, asked independent group look list patients got COVID figure vaccine placebo. I'm sure I'd cry tear joy FDA approves it. I'm almost checking r/coronavirus every hour good news.
Wow imagine many lives would saved. many people loved ones.
I'm emotional already  really considering close everyone need multiple doses. cleaner working quarantine hotel infected surface transmmision spread family. said wearing mask? think there’s money made a, $100 vaccine would consumers felt confident go spend $1k + stores restaurants.

pretty sure everyone list places want go it’s safe, you’re going spend lot stores vaccine therefore government generates tax revenue. really looking flu symptoms get couple days shot.

Also healthcare worker longer feeling unsafe due idiocy fellow community members expect us drop everything help don’t follow guidelines. come Florida lower reopened earlier cared much? CCW firearm times. Solved. reports I've read they're saying general public access April, vaccinations done June. I'm hoping conservative numbers.

There article local paper saying local hospital setting freezers expecting receive first doses end year. order delivery going staff, elderly, high risk young people, general public. private businesses free refuse service always been. still call pfizer vaccine?  I'm bitter angry, I'd strike. Intubate yourselves.  Pfizer study double blind neither subjects Pfizer knew got vaccine got placebo. Could still working doses? Good giving bojo new quarantine even though tested positive earlier year  Yes it’s designed way measure usefulness effectively. Yes yes yes. 🙌

I work clinical lab. truly (seemingly) never ending nightmare. finally hit stride around August buckle flu season spikes, far high expected. We’re expecting another round supply shortages well.

I haven’t seen family since December 2019. 

Stay fuck home, people! Yes, yes, be. least early-mid 2022 US probably. Hate say that's guess majority people anti-vaxx vaccinated Moderna Pfizer deliberately slowed P3 testing ensure enough minorities. seen pfizers numbers believe 37% percentage minorities Moderna phase 3.

They enroll pregnant women children testing. Fauci said spring sounds right. I’m going first line it. Let everybody else get first see happens, will.  There's virus know almost nothing show symptoms show symptoms killing thousands every day. selfish putting others risk contracting virus need go buy something really need.

I imagine dont since I'm going staying put thing, gives peace mind I'm killing fellow humans. We've made sacrifices, bad hard you. Sure ""listen experts"". read past headline? says 1/4 never get it. 2/3 wouldn’t get *immediately*. 


I won’t getting immediately either. I’m healthy guy 20’s. I’m nearly much risk parts population. pharmaceutical companies exempt lawsuits regarding vaccine, don’t think it’s crazy careful new, rushed vaccine. 

Trials looking really great now. Looks like vaccine doesn’t many side effects, making easier sell get vaccinated it’s available demographic. article published September- much final phase results new vaccines known. would said thing September- “we’ll see it’s safe”. 


I hope don’t come across crazy antivax boi. Vaccines *have* rolled causing considerable harm mistakes made production development. That's pretty big assumption country still 30 000 cases, done extensive testing contact tracing. Low probability even one four would previous exposure. It'll free.

The government want people getting vaccine cost - drag things longer.

And, cost government sounds like lot, keep perspective. Even $50 dose, every American gets 2 doses looking somewhere around $33 billion. sounds like lot, remember Congress passed SECOND stimulus package Democrats think $500 billion package Republicans want nearly enough. Hey look everybody hyperbole police, better hope shoot us historical definition guns. Cabin Fever ive lockdown thing since March guy lost AAA contract bc Moderna one stored sub zero temps too? Yea, tried write simple could. simpler basically describing normal vaccine. think main thing trains find sub-components virus, opposed whole thing. foresee tidal wave good news next year. genuinely believe we're way golden age social togetherness medical advancement. generation hard done this, hopefully they'll ones benefit done. UN states billion hungry people earth, say otherwise. I’m supposed believe brainwashed low-karma dude Reddit organization who’s job track poverty starvation? you’re unwilling even look yourself, relying solely redditors research? one takes conservitards seriously 😂😂😂😂  Yeah got side effects means basically nothing. That's double blind studies necessary. Placebo real vaccine still anything already covid? anti-lockdown protests Europe. one London recently. I've already decided get sick future years, mask probably coming back out. actually enjoy wearing it, find comfortable I'm feeling good 2025, put I'm public stop getting someone else sick? I'm curious, us vaccinated, still need wear masks? still help prevent spread it? Well yah acknowledge there’s conclusive evidence time you’re saying half cases long term chronic effects?

The study linked still 10 weeks initials symptoms far cry 6 months stupidity.

It bioterrorism. all! absolutely wonderful. almost cannot believe fast science moved behind this, high effective rate. makes bit skeptical, *something*. Something breaking people stop listening short-sighted. people saved world, astounding. know side effects, work everyone, *something* help us. I'm beside news! Sarcastic impersonation anti-maskers reasoning, refusing wear mask hours time. want healthcare workers safe. putting life line us. Hopefully gets soon take care frontline First time read it.

What would say invalidated last 2 months? Yes, idea. remember afraid touching things could contaminated. put mask on. think would give anxiety attack around people without mask. around lot people all. backstreet boy concert. one gig everything shut down. cousin went last gig thinks infected. never got tested. I’m healthcare mat leave right now, I’m really happy like 90% people know early access. I’ve worried everyone. That's mostly read though. offense, sub really fear mongering train long time. individual workers fault job government failed them. right protect anyone else does. let walk out. one owes life saving another. Especially shit avoided proper leadership. Greece's first Vs second covid wave. 

 really shows bad get months bad decision(opening tourism) 100 people 6000 infected study. 900 provide proof positive entering study... like, wtf.

Do know surgical mask less useful protecting wear? yes, need respirators protect yourself. question study aimed solve, reach goal, authors admitted.  think really true though. think lot people feel pressure come family, start let guard ""just one life event"" understand contagious really is. Add alcohol mix no, 100 coronavirus-is-a-hoaxers outcome like this. say anything even needs PornHub right going on? governor democrat send two democrat senators state yeah kind shithole. God bless Illinois  upheld mandatory inoculations... 1902, vaccines really thing. major challenge since.

Forgive optimistic ultrapartisan supreme court reverse decision, would make Biden look bad way. comment basically meaning this, understanding, Pfizer took money operation warp speed, they’d listen government regards pricing not. 

Since didn’t, charge whatever, however want, free American people situation congress work out

It’s 10 I’m stoned definitely probably didn’t word original comment good “Participants randomized mask group control group mask group given supply surgical masks. participants completed weekly surveys antibody tests PCR testing COVID-19 symptoms developed, 1 month.” 

Select whose job require masks, give masks, ask complete WEEKLY survey? don’t even bother call study, mention self-proclaimed “randomized trial.” There's still several follow ups besides initial testing. release info participants now, 4 months later something wild happens patients unblind results. 100% sci-fi based real life! also went straight honeymoon sounds like instead chilling 2 weeks make sure traveling plague carriers. So...that's fun. probably infected bunch people flight/resort. Right, stresses workers place plus families innocent people best still get exposed somehow. 

I hope media attention leads change, hope they'll walk job. lead death. “Final result” = “most recent data analysis”
I believe 2 year trial, far “final result”, encouraging far. may misunderstanding point, vaccines like typical flu contains weakened form virus giving possibility lite flu symptoms. covid virus vaccine possibly infect you. title sounds much cooler President Pro Tempore Senate definitely worse before. Even rest new restrictions gone six feet distant lines space problem.  Fauci truth bomb.

This assuming major mutations hopeful thing despite claim. 

If covid endemic animal populations, know two places is, zoonotic infections driving mutation know are....

If true I'd expect dealing covid flare ups foreseeable future. think obvious true. “Rate effectiveness” term art case... vaccines seem prevent people developing severe symptoms, don’t know actually protects catching spreading virus. So. Much. Winning. agree. Growing up, holidays always time unrealistic expectations family drama. adult, holidays in-laws incredibly boring food generally terrible. I’m actually thrilled excuse see them, may continue next year even things back normal. 40000 people. They've got numbers. They've done math. mask social distancing going part life good.

The pandemic taught theres many people give fuck.

Has helped really elevate hygiene, even bit neurotic levels. Trump Nobody ever bitched flu vaccines ha clue work they’re for.  Right. every country manages get access early vaccines, first vaccinate medical workers elderly people certain medical conditions military. time general public even allowed get vaccination, 100 million people vaccinated already across world.

So people saying ""I'm going wait data"" forced wait anyway. never locked down, numbers bad compare Belgium, Spain, UK, Italy , France, lock down, number deaths per 1M pop worse. 

The second wave hitting us hard, like countries, look number deaths hospitalizations, still bad spring. important know sweden barely testing spring, compared anyone get test. we're seeing big surge number cases, nearly big number deaths hospitilazations. 

We getting stronger restrictions resturants venues, recomendations become lot harder well. lockdown ever place probably never will. fatigue things Covid, suspect dealing end hell might worth it. want take vacation next year, it'll probably much expensive usual. that. bunch schmucks got together used attack country take away even rights get us bunch unnecessary wars, killing even us process. long protection last for? can’t find anything that. headline misleading. Avoided commercial flight also. Props trump destorying covid biden chance embarass data yet vaccine eliminates transmission risk? think that's important efficacy preventing covid. still transmission risk makes whole lot asymptomatic carriers community. even Thanksgiving yet. real shitstorm coming like runaway freight train. winter covid hell USA. North jersey here, know 3 people died something like 25 more. friend lost parents, another lost grandparent. boss ICU 2 weeks March. I’m gonna doubt fatigue worse virus causes. never felt exhausted I’ve got MS: so, fatigue something I’m well acquainted with. 40% said wouldn't.  Buddy, ain't pal asking put world psychological tailspin account couple hundred healthy people dying grip people co-morbidities dying.


You irrational. End discussion get information? Yeah, said Trump called bluff. Cuomo getting vaccine day 1. 55 million cases covid worldwide? many actual cases someone getting infected twice?

Also, you’ve covid recovered still carrier pass others? YES! I’m going avoid taking kids go grocery store long get away it. made realize much hated it. someone explain 5% is? die?  Sorry! rough. I'd kill get watch live hockey game. last year double-whammy travel. 

It's proven need in-person order effective lot things, created laser-focus operating expenses. things going disappear everybody's head get covid shot. Without sounding like asshat one guys 5% assuming 50% vaccinated actually bring line flu. ideal tolerable healthcare system. Singling huge source community spread controversial statement...and yet are. Yeah, easy, dumb math taking death rate (don't take account massive number recently diagnosed people reached point die/survive, also ignore we've gotten better keeping people alive), rate infections last week puts 25k dead per week. getting worse gets better (just based normal exponential growth expectations we've seen previous spikes, taking account winter/holiday fuel we're throwing fire). 

I'd bet 400k mid January closing 500k March. Yup. anglophone world, it’s exclusively known „Pfizer Vaccine“ - promoted even Donald himself. impression mRNA bare minimum vaccines. works everything else likely work. thing available, data effects 1 year in, something now. wish guys well. live NYC fucking traumatic past Spring. drive refrigerated trucks every couple days, knowing filled bodies. Absolute horror show. Maybe gets 1 25 us Americans might start think taking seriously. It'd rigged testing effective vaccine day 1, testing well works healthy Corona free people day 28, healthy Corona free person day 28 dosent apply Children world rest easy. global pandemic won’t stop tracking Santa Claus’ progress delivers gifts around globe Christmas Eve.

The North American Aerospace Defense Command announced NORAD track Santa Dec. 24, done 65 years. changes: every child able get volunteer [NORAD’s call check Santa’s whereabouts, years before.

Normally, 150-160 volunteers crowd conference room Peterson Air Force Base Colorado Springs, taking two-hour shifts answer phones eager children call see Santa sleigh reached rooftops. together, 1,500 people 20 hours participated call center past, fielding 130,000 phone calls, beginning 6 a.m. Eastern time Christmas Eve.

This year, due safety restrictions forced [the COVID-19 number volunteers drastically cut NORAD expects fewer 10 people per shift.

“We understand time-honored tradition, know undoubtedly going disappointment,” said NORAD spokesman Preston Schlachter. “But we’re trying keep safe everyone involved.” know dozen people gotten covid vaccine describe exactly say, minus sore arm. tired, body aches, mild temperature headaches day two felt great next day. work also says common symptom feeling sick one day feeling great days follow. discussed before, find sources. people reporting numbers Socialstyrelsen even repeated almost daily briefings spring, ICU numbers patients respirator. look information intensive care intermediary care Sweden find difference too. Why? Vaccination wont thing unless mandatory.

We got plenty idiots Belgium afraid vaccine disease, already spouting paranoia everywhere convincing people get it.

I cant imagine different USA, anything it'll even problem. Note: gave days obligation gatherings extended refuses stay home flu.

Same. I'm sick tired getting sick tired people give fuck make people sick. I'm expert this, Dr. Fauci said yesterday thinks vaccinations high priority people start towards end December. I'm inferring weeks month Shift workers... everyone lives schedule.    still apparently see good protection one grateful first global trial reach final efficacy analysis mark indicates high rate protection COVID-19 achieved fast first 30 µg dose, underscoring power BNT162 providing early Let’s go similarities differences COVID HIV, cause sounds like round table discussion got things wrong.

**Similarity:** likely saying virus destroys t-cells, HIV also destroys. 

**Difference:** “neither MERS-CoV SARS-CoV-2 demonstrated ability replicate cells. HIV, contrast, replicates aggressively white blood cells.” (Forbes)

**Similarity:** comparisons drawn towards response AIDS COVID epidemics.

**Difference:** researchers said “these findings cause us assume SARS-CoV-2 like HIV,” (Forbes)

**DIFFERENCES OVERALL**

• “COVID-19 acute disease versus chronic nature HIV” (contagionlive.com) miss Coronavirus hype earlier year..now feels like one cares Bro even country's strict mask rules spreading anti maskers issue schools young adults partying spreading oh protest bars. Like said..  people not. hundreds co-workers I've worked with, times, 100% is.  Pfizer said 90% around 90 infections, 170 infections confirm actual number 95%. Yes yes, it’s like TSA, optics. Yeah might get touching something you’re way likely get jerk sitting cubes won’t wear mask wafts you. Thanks I’m 2 Tyfys  leaders reflection people. way, means democracy kinda works, elect people lie tell want hear that's like.

""Yes, would like pretend pandemic real, I'd like keep able go mall. I'll vote people agree that."" Random question sister signed AstraZeneca trial get jab next week. Curious worth given one available likely April? Would able get vaccine - considering study blind may even get AZ vaccine? already DelMarVa region early February, sure. One local schools Maryland ""flu outbreak"" almost 30% enrolled students fell ill within two week period, month lockdown started. know people spent new years eve times square came home covid symptoms. determined Ohio prisons almost completely overrun covid April. hit 10% positivity rate testing. Kudos California New York keeping relatively low, even starting trend upwards. Goodness, South Dakota...  good news environment dangerous thing say. depends people job feed themselves. Imagine hotel brazil go busted cause there's business travel. What's chance end working company destroying forest? speak Geramany, life felt pretty normal summer. Clubs closed bars strict seating arrangments, can't imagine world severe measures summer especially vaccine can’t believe used live vaccine 100%


Even MMR 2 doses 97% effective measles 88% effective mumps, I'd say 95% amazing fighting COVID-19! hard time believing institution would install AP like that. Blasphemy. I’m nuts Pfizer say 90 first moderna said 95 ? read original paper Spain.  one worst cases ""correlation mean causation"" I've ever seen. post removed because:

That's retarded different places need different things. Every country across entire globe region region. type person denies downplays risk virus probably type person believes 9/11 conspiracy theories...”fire can’t melt steel”

Probably people believe Oswald delivered fatal shot ""was shooter November 22, 1963"" Blame Zoom interested peer review disagree premise. You’re right one ready rn progressive movement eventually lead positive change here.

Narrator: not. NJ confirm, one likes you. Ding ding ding!!

Capitalism value self care mental emotional well being. Hell, probably encourages opposite that! long term recipie disaster people stay politically active go back brunch. solid points things wondered. Since think they’re “immune” they’re going night clubs, restaurants, bars, etc multiple times week. Thank you. think it’s best tough last months even though sucks! 1. don’t know time hasn’t passed
2. vaccinate older people healthcare workers first. 
3. Eventually herd immunity take over. enough people get vaccine virus nowhere live. almost gathering large groups people indoors gives virus opportunity spread... feels weird might soon. It’s gonna take get vaccine next month see life back normal next may US constitution works all. think, people wore masks socially distanced themselves, months(maybe 6 7), would mess. That's guess blood bath continue. think they’re immune won’t wear masks. OK outside want drinking dinner hangout. 9/11 happened one greatest cities e ever exist nowhere. statistically least popular state year long pandemic. one cares. also pick germs ground. Like droplets fall down. cuddle dog. ...And even December yet...   need good decimation. Yeah much way  finger upvote last sentence.  Americans won’t inconvenienced miss want

The entitled people history planet. Totally agree anyone actually wearing face shields addition masks? bought don’t see anyone area (mask mandated) wearing them, unless using place face mask. don’t understand many people/companies placing huge emphasis cleaning sanitizing. Isn’t rare virus spread surface? Don’t vast majority people get infected airborne droplets?  Even 20% anti-vaxxers, 94% effectivity need vaccinate maybe 70% people (and probably less illness already probably immune) pandemic gone herd immunity.

It's 94% effective disease though, necessarily infection Again, even IHME, shifted 400,000 deaths January, February, March, even predicting that. 95% =/= 100%.  issue three-fold: 

a - extremely dumb

b - heard 99% survival rate ignored everything else 

c - big orange idiot worship enough people take shot(s), 5% protected getting exposed virus.  That's getting almost people take shot(s) critical. course.

As soon make money will, many people saying reason many CoVID19 cases hospitals make windfall them.

In reality hospitals incentive keep CoVID19 cases make money procedures.

Inpatient care low profit, money medicine vastly skewed towards procedures. Well thinking SA QLD border technically nearby yeah, exactly walking distance 😂 opinion, take grain salt: won’t know another year true reinfection rate is. It’s novel virus, means opportunity longitudinal studies. Last time heard, 10% population caught it. likelihood (with masks, distancing, shutdowns, etc.) caught come contact again? “immune,” mean can’t harbor spread virus mean immune system developed response? hype? would’ve thought people would want live mismanaged flyover state? Yup, EU prime example this. get infection rates real low, none us islands isolated countries like NZ, AUS, SK, Taiwan. Getting cases 0 near impossibility countries share large land borders free populations, opening things eventually lead spread. prefer use excess deaths, since covers full spectrum impact Covid without bogged false counts BS people could use pretend numbers false.

In case 300,000 back beginning October. can't find updated figures, month half Better economy shutting months uncontrolled spread like happened Melbourne remember joke. “America stuck end stage capitalist death spiral lol” - 2008.

Lol indeed.. :( Pfizer trial participants like can't imagine daily stress HCWs right now. I'm talking cases, ""waves"". NZ several outbreaks since initial lockdown, spite claiming beaten COVID. There's good reason outside cases getting local community. keeps happening, someone needs looking keeps happening put stop it. 

My actual point different ways avert small outbreaks severe lockdowns like one one Melbourne solution. misleading. minerva ok missing /s serious comment? Good hear. Thanks info Fair enough. 

If ever get interested, worth reading community. People think Catholic church bad abuse, ain't go nothing people.

Any light shined exposing shit goes good thing me, understand stance. Number 1 simply impossible know right now. vaccine (or virus) around long enough. dog owners apartment/condo buildings. Waking dog communal stairs elevators 6-8 times day. well, sort of. [scientists already working technology it’s true progress sped dramatically year investment money manpower coronavirus vaccine development. It’s also true first time mRNA vaccine actually completing trials almost ready approved. Slightly scary,but also exciting, might beginning end current predicament, technology apparently also promising treatment serious conditions, including cancer. could whole new era medicine lol Remember? distracted trump getting impeached end February....meanwhile virus ran rampant. it’s trump’s fault! Even though trump said close border China Biden said you’re racist. Oh well....let’s ignore Exactly, what's difference backlog? could stop counting week two claim backlog 500k cases France ""soften blow"". no, every single person every march i've year properly masked. stop lying.

are confusing eyes wide shut? That’s great sentiment, people still going whine like Insolent children 10 pm curfew. would followed directions months ago, might better handle this. it’s time deal consequences. definitely nature weeds stupid. Darwinism real time. hope people right things don’t get sick someone else’s negligence. can't handle people screaming employer? like job much already? Lol offense funny see someone calling others really stupid buying lottery tickets. protests cause spikes. masks. outdoors. etc. talked one minute outside masks distancing. no. estimates percentage US infected already? sort effective approach. work people why? still understand it. Biomedical person know, got it, you’re less immune first were...big common misunderstanding fear real...fucking media Hospitalization rate currently 1.5%. honestly quite understand low, although probably increase positivity continues grow. Average stay hospital 22 days though. What? Put money mask is? 
*Backpedals*... first year went cold flu season without cold flu. I'll wearing masks foreseeable future, can. compared virus leaf said since leaves change probably makes sense   craziest part is, giant conspiracy, doctors like things life get better, it? like listening maybe prolonging this? Sadly month, everyone's gonna see listened. hope dry turkey worth it. Northeast getting ready pop 2 weeks. :( think we’re supposed carry mask times case come close people street. used take mask went walks (well except early pandemic wore whole walk days read didn’t to). COVID-19 #3 cause death year get first reported death end February. federal government plan except let states deal problem occasionally throw couple tires fire.

It's patience keeps wearing mask, vigilance. danger growing long looming people -or can't- see anymore. there. straining healthcare system. going enough people vaccinated small part President US refused wear mask public outset. rise challenge rapidly growing pile dead Americans.

It takes going without mask can't know time go without mask. Masks work. work better thought did. Like seatbelts, many adults still refuse wear.

Covid get tired. let guard down. Contact tracing possible 160k cases day. Unrealistic Almost year virus US taking considerations, wonder it’s chaotic. Fauci national treasure. Authority figures politicals polarization anything it. American focus individual that's real problem. ""You care people"" politically contentious issue. lol delusional expect people get every obscure reference dropped.

Dogs much go restaurants, least i'm hate it. Maybe live rock. Plot twist - Israel going send vaccinations West Bank Gaza Strip first.  understand either got sick diarrhea multiple months afterwards. needed tp, lots it. thank you, fuck FED. Im listening state fines levied parking violations there's good reason can't levied failure wear masks pandemic. . likely vascular damage caused tiny blood clots blocking flow people’s teeth. Micro clots could damage like that. Also depends lot country. quicker, easier access others. True, case still doesn’t make sense Republican, makes sense leftist Yes, point I'm 13 years old hopefully news people reddit.

Also, actually working body/heart important concerns aside body fat ratio. often can't change people's minds respect mountains data. Shame place society. Ancient Greek philosophers knew would well remember it. may resent shaming right thing, way they'll right thing.   Yes, kids handle control know future be. future never set stone becomes past. I’m long strategically sounds effective likely one two years equivalent 1918 Spanish Flu life cycle vaccine issuing it.

But, all, isn’t me. It’s community, neighbors, friends, relatives, everyone. takes group effort.  President, President-Elect, Speaker House, President Pro Temp Senate, Fauci... list goes on. We’re gerontocracy. interesting. could see that. fair, actually line regulations Northeast, cases still skyrocketing apparently that’s much ask. Hell, can’t even get people board masks... literally easiest part. real tho. much calories intake minus calories burn. Unless medical condition affects weight thats different topic. Damn men. american's want lead everything.? Maybe there's opening Justin Turner becomes Dodgers free agent. Thank you! whole family coming six months.... UK study said 6-12 months. brand new don’t know everything. I’m always curious. Thank stay safe 💜 dumb fuck leaving part literally wrote ""vote peacefully protest"" 

get dumb fuck ass lmao. read headline got carried away. admit it. fucking lemming less sick second time? bad might been? Looks worst case scenario possible. world from? It’s horrendous Immunity isn’t long lasting everyone, people. friend could one unlucky ones. I'm ok side effects get vaccinated Friday afternoon weekend ride side effects work Monday. virus like, long Corona. might been?

You act ND things control. traffic roads = good times lambo driving. Ask OP! ""Will lose confidence"" past tense rather future tense. Speak yourself, fucking love able sing quietly anybody think I'm crazy would seriously tempted contact management places tell them: “Are aware irony allowing unmasked employees seen days hazmat consultant attending workplace?” rate going, millions get infected ever get vaccine. Why’s telling us?  I’m guessing better chance putting together do. Exactly. democrats wanted fund bunch unrelated stuff like arts give money illegal immigrants bail states debt. republicans neither side would come together come agreement. sides blame loser American public Happy cake day COVID! Thanks, doctor science.  almost. determine pre-symptomatic contagious, critical 24-48 hr period unknowing superspreading occurs.

think way: 1) incubation phase, 2) pre-symptomatic contagious, 3) symptomatic contagious, 4) symptomatic non-contagious, 5) post-symptomatic 

rapid tests detect 2-3, whereas lab PCR tests detect 2-5. test detect incubation phase, viral load low.

all testing best done regular basis, ideally would done daily. least level sporadic testing better none, especially combined social distancing. Unless something goes horribly wrong lot happy about. Fauci previously said got vaccine 50% effective would fantastic. 90% huge. Yeah, different. keep remembering bring mask I’m walks put people around. Didn’t before. wasn’t rural suburb wide streets, would wear whole walk now, too. Well knowledge I, along thousands thousands millennials millions retirees want travel abroad going soon chance. Fun fact too! Weight gain/loss influenced diet. yeah working + good combo. There's much workouts calisthenics Nah fuck outta keep states rights. don’t need deal already bc people south cant get shit together. Good. someone works business phobia flying, hate skip jobs require travel job searching. Ok I’ll get shots, wait however long needs get immunity running I’m done. alone I’m feeling way. 

I couldn’t care less people choose get vaccinated - I’m zero moral obligation make decisions sort variable calculus.  remember reading back March virologists think we're witnessing pandemic ""birth"" new common-cold coronavirus. brutal virus first hits naive adult population, people develop immunity *systemic/ pulmonary* disease ""reinfections"" present common colds (upper respiratory tract *mucosal* disease). 🤷🏼‍♀️ intubated, added extra strain oral health? God.. live city.... well. COVID me. ☺️ Lol anti maskers refuse wear masks general population is. Imagine refusing vaccinations continue refuse wear masks protection even smaller population. Correct. not. You’ll see results weeks. Thank this. live alone good distance girlfriend living father since mother passed away summer (not due COVID). going visit them. grad student works alone doesn’t interact anyone. wear masks safe responsible whole time. really sucks feel guilty/anxious dickwads country decided give flying fuck behavior since June. Wait, that's socialism, right 🤔 science supporting use masks outdoors social distanced? shocking. 😢 quarantine fatigue setting hang couple months. here. trusted eveyrone would actually wear mask properly wouldnt feel like to. fact need interact complete strangers obviously dont care covid arent wearing mask public it. worry less others caring. know still get covid studies show wayyyyy less chance get infected. nurses doctors work covid patients get sick this. Yeah, predictions depressingly accurate. Hope alright, Florida denizen. covid real. small business, purchasing manager supply company deal got Covid June year. said sick 3 weeks, 5 months slowly getting smell back. Watch happens 2-3 weeks cases. Data shows what’s coming people even go get tested. France also leveling too. real concern enough get 2nd surge since soon it'll winter. Dumb fucks... thought learned toilet paper panic necessary God damn 1 100,000 chance happening me, better odds get covid.

Like said causing side effects, time takes cause them. going pick effects within weeks/months, that's entire point I'm making, we've established vaccines negative effects, probably longer particular vaccine risk age group.

Also, ""whether influenza diseases past. Even stage, appear narcolepsy following vaccination pandemic influenza general worldwide phenomenon, excess narcolepsy reported several European states Pandemrix used, Canada pandemic vaccine similar pandemrix used. complicates interpretation findings Finland Sweden"" ROFLMAO

Texas Gov. Greg Abbott close lock businesses willing cancel small Texas town 30% positivity rate virus rampant here. need cancel holidays need close bars, indoor dining, take school remote, mandate mask. ticket wearing seatbelt ticket wearing mask. need get real prepare death friends, family, loved ones. 

Or get ready cancel Christmas. Nice. talk Labrador. Remember leaked videos people dropping dead street Wuhan? eventually, right after. see anything wrong statement. Obviously sarcastic/pointing idiocy current leader.  But.... pandemic something new, year, election. say vote this. literally voted state legislatures, many ones denying role helping contain virus. 

You say one knew would act way, acting way year. he's troll, feed him. There’s guarantee pandemic ending soon. Oof I’ve seen sure it’s actually CDC... direct link? ?Do yoga take week off?   one would hoped six months span hospitals would given sufficient PPE, treatments determined, testing/tracing improved, vaccines pipeline, etc etc. US moderately well seems like people gave middle race. two months vaccine? people could held line bit better summer looking clock showing 1500 deaths per day vaccine gets put arms Never heard put way, that’s good way put it. So... you’re troll? [Sinovac said 97% Financially I'm better due stimulus going stores random stuff. Definitely back normal though Lol! Trumpies, think, completely backwards. Increasing testing would drive people without disease get tested, believing may asymptomatic. testing could actually drive infection rate down. likely, assuming becomes like typical common cold U.S., Target size L/XL reusable masks Goodfellow &amp; Co. in-house brands like that, cover larger faces pretty well. would understand COVID19 microchip. vaccine comes, tyranny comes It’s like vegetarians vegans reason feel need get meat-like meals. Never understood that. amidst surge also might help...

[Viruses Bacteria Etiology Common Seeing China Vietnam crushing now, get that? Must nice get paid nothing. Sad ivy-league-educated dad says shit. Fuck conservative pundits peehole Honestly man know supposed happening anymore world   There’s always fuck like rain parade. Thanks much, really needed shit we’ve through! double April rate fairly small population, that's 95% country uninhabitable.

The population density areas people actually live high America. Sydney Melbourne 5 million residents each. 

Victoria 7 times densely populated North Dakota. Lockdowns contact tracing worked Victoria, North Dakota excuse. disagree, however plenty people younger unfortunately serious issues. larger population long term effects even though survived According 78 year old mother “those stupid assholes Facebook church say faith fear”. She’s Indiana. Canada thanksgiving October numbers gone way since. safe. Theres 2 issues. One guy worked busy restaurant also deliveries possibly/probably infectious. Two strain covid apparently much infectious symptoms significantly milder.

Also, whole state lockdown 6 days contact tracers time contact everybody ensure they’re testing/isolating etc etc spreads control. They’re want avoid 3 month lockdown. never said complete normalcy, think anybody said complete normalcy. 

We said next winter back normal close summer. Bayer see even moronic Australian pm lead tiny country mess  Yeah mean look wuhan now. Back normal. It’s pretty astounding fuck super harsh lockdown worked amazingly. heard actually cops delivering groceries house house avoid necessity regular people going instead much easily trainable traceable group go basic things. Odd link, Russian cyrillic б abc.com info regarding duration immunity? reported cases reinfections. idea long vaccine immunity would last easily manipulated possible future strains/mutations?  always person plane whipped germ-x wipes seat, tray table seat belt sat down. husband used kind roll eyes he’s like “you something!” definitely think masks become commonplace colds/flu future, many Asian countries.  CDC ALWAYS politically influenced organization, they've folded much Trump. countless examples, also pockets insurance companies riddled corruption issues. hard say current climate think need public trust basic guidelines like masks, social distancing, isolating, etc... damn truth them. Covid gonna hit US regardless main vectors LA Seattle Asia New York Europe. Containment obviously far late saw stat says 60% Americans live 3.5% land area. Even ""small"" city like Jacksonville Des Moines something like Pfizer vaccine would work fine. Skip trailers drag bodies straight nearest body water. knew gators good something! statistics, 5% standard deviation normal.

Im really hopefull std dev! Yea it’s likely restrictions lifted progressively things like going packed club whatever might take June hand sanitizer everywhere hospitals. rigid entry policies appointments. masks everyone. adjoining structures less full randoms (things like interior starbucks longer swamped people), course, waiting rooms spaced out.

mileage probably varies hospital hospital, noticed changes immediately area. Understand this, people likely spread virus also ones likely get vaccine.

Yes, government needs apply pressure. unvaccinated group large enough, increases chance virus mutate... mostly husband interior designer, wants see everything laid out.
He also likes scope hotels we're staying in, decide would want stay future visit. get going Google Street view, study forever. Thanks guess misunderstood previous comment, assumed associated common cold meant directly related. separate families virus, thought. 

Thank clarification! Private schools receive tens thousands funding per student choose students attend. afford smaller class sizes, testing, PPE, janitorial services. teachers union bargain hybrid virtual options better ensure staff safety. often don’t special education services need accommodations high needs students need continual hands assistance educators and/or severe behavior concerns make wearing masks washing hands impossible.  got downvoted hell saying reopening schools cause spikes cases children harbor virus, sub others am. call Shirley 12 million people year, next. shit. Would help POTUS even pretended give crap. Depends state city. urgent cares city rapid tests get results leaving place, don’t get rapid test get 2-4 days. rapid tests also aren’t reliable though. partner came back negative doctor sent somewhere else day gave traditional non-rapid tests came back positive.

No, already knew terrible idea. whipped 39 citation article overnight Trump/ Trump Jr. said need reopen schools. always political.

If one cannot without is...necessary. 

Your opinion otherwise means nothing. vaccine placebo given ~40,000 people waited reach desired number infections total population. reached, data unblinded see many infected given placebo vs vaccine. ~95% people infected belonged placebo group gives us high confidence vaccine works. would’ve one easiest landslide elections US history. Thank this. seem understand addressing opinion differs hostility instead education rarely works.

I definitely class cautious people. healthy distrust government US's past &amp; life experience. main concern lack testing time. definitely partaking first round that's passed out. stay date reports come out. Evidence? think reading bery different sources.

Where live, necessity masks clear day one, people use covid hit us hard. Fauci said first cause shortage medical workers.

Survives surfaces? 8 hours materials 3 days that, kept hearing march, called large numbers safe think.

At beggining graphs age groups, 3% China, much, much higjer flu, every kills young people.

The curve quite flat honestly. whole europe saying that, imposter fit right in.

In information sphere (Latvia) opposite, think US putting effort calming people saving them, whereas Europe told worst case. know unchecked virus great tourism. Yeah. That's gets me.
People preach. preach immediately 180 ""they tired need live life"". long receives death threats? 

Our governor state police front house since June.

These anti maskers dangerous folks. wouldn’t surprise people thought that. cashier disgruntled denied right free roam around hospital.

If put everyone town’s IQ together, could probably use fingers count though. Yes, that's way prove something science.You provide evidence.
I really catch affirm reinfections rare.

Reinfections indeed rare because:

1- cases proven, even pandemic ongoing world researching (but agree cases taken account).

2-As far studies go, body produces antibodies immune cell response virus. know way body fights viral infections.

3-Coronavirus known viruses, infections time virus immunity infection proved (SARS, MERS).


About ""No evidence person person spread. evidence spreads easily... etc"" sounds like cuestionable guidelines, entirely based scientific evidence. doubt make vaccine mandatory happened swine flue vaccine. Hey bill eat satchel richards stay lane brilliany coputer guy annointed great oz vaccines. Population every thing enuff make os stfu Meanwhile, Utah says ""Hold root beer!"" proudly flaunts opened schools 24% positivity rate. Yes. sub pisses off. People like create panic covid also gives excuse lazy ask unemployment giveaways Even asymptomatic mild case there's HUGE chance completely FUCKED WTF 38% call normal? Lol they’re bunch thanksgiving memes internets. Americans dont care don’t know who’s still going day flu sure shit can’t handle it. go bed wake 5 days later. ones going thanksgiving life back normal, you’re problem.  Can't wait Biden Vaccine cure Trump Flu. thinking last part. failure leadership it’s skirting responsibility lower lower levels government. Many Governors (mine Missouri included) punt issue even county level, saying lock things contact trace think need to. counties aren’t equipped resources make decisions, least scientifically. Plus one county diligent still get hurt neighboring, disorganized county. 

We badly needed adult top government provide fact-based leadership, didn’t get it. 38% must high kites. not. I'm NY. Maybe, though requirements social distancing see certain businesses remaining closed. 38% who's lives back normal driving increase cases. one's life precovid normal Top tier troll special kind idiot, world may never know. old ""I hate Congress, love Congress-critter""  never pretended protect people. dangerous false statement. I'm overjoyed. really am. :) jerk?
Oh I'm sorry. know looking things views arguing someone close-minded = jerk. articles distribution? 38%? I'm gonna come back memories. maybe I'm taking granted hugging people think leave house. Exactly also forget last major issue vaccine 44 years... whole EU cautionary tale, Sweden special.

So distribution interaction European country-specific COVID-19 related articles somewhat equal adjusted population size? G P lawsuit 3,2,1... bring good point. Commenting quick retrieval year trip Disneyland. I’m surprised 38% say back normal. Florida man completely rails. speculate though based stats like waste water seroprevelance. *A lot* 900k caught FL. fact party incapable presenting competent candidate state, I'd vote Gavin heartbeat. \+1, really simple that. education country maybe they’re better exploring things they’re curious about. Keep step drum bud you’re doin great guess... solves... Overpopulation? part, kids aren’t dying. There’s rare exceptions, kids don’t usually die this. quarter million people dead nothing you, interesting takeaway. yeah engaging ""muh fake news"" nonsense, directly contributing denialism. Seems content killing folks, sorry malfunction.


Hard take accurate measurements *in middle pandemic*. gave CDC confirming thing posted links affirming this. extraordinary claim respiratory disease cause lung scarring, much less contagious one permanently harming others scale thousands.


Statistics like ""oh .02% infected die"" seems small 1/4 million less year, seems pretty heartless boil excess deaths nothing ""irelevent"" numbers. get vaccined till know 100% safe. lab rat science. Spring extremely optimistic lmao, wont enough doses figured much, wanted sure something different one. Thank you! has. I've made great tendies TSLA. 99% bad odds. jar 100 delicious m&amp;ms, one deadly would eat one? Also don’t forget 10 others may give life long complications chronic health problems.

Victoria's numbers also started coming start 2nd coldest month year.

Fingers crossed. work, companies care. Masks hard wear. would say wearing mask even bit harder wearing seat belt, almost hard brushing teeth.  can't expect people things difficult. Day 1: Common. Fucking.

Keep drinking kool-aid. People love whine point fingers I've learned thread. wear mask everywhere public 🤷 difference shutting businesses mandate close restraint seating, limit exposure, limit people leave houses.

Society always personal freedoms. That's makes society society instead individuals think best. problem disease spreads quickly common flu dictates decision. filling hospital beds killing elderly easily would different.

It's spitting though. risk going often necessities come contact tens people same.

Going daily business exactly pandemic speeding instead slowing down. 2% could kill someone wanted coffee god damned dinner restaurant, that's you. 

There absolutely reason keep businesses open whole online ordering cash. using drive through. Going daily lives safe manner. I've retail decade. still go job limit exposure. That's thing ""continuing daily lives die"". 

Countries, towns, cities able shut Benn better it. I'm sorry. ""freedom"" excuse say willing take blame someone dies wanted fucking latte. Touch mailbox, touch door handle,


Everyone leave houses point order food. can't accept limiting better not? think smarter scientists doctors urging people better?

I hate attack you, online I'm really angry, confused. I'll conversation without downvoting you. understand. government right mandate what's best society whole. killing people wear masks, might save lives. can't force never leave house, limit it. Why? might save lives. Limiting freedom kill you. 


It's law. right bear arms, limit. Noone needs assault rifles hunt protect house. even freedom bombs. Yes know That. know number We’re starting see local favorites shutting indefinitely uncertainty inability see end sight Montana. restaurants around town decades. current governor releasing bit aid, GOP taking hold 2021, expect last aid see current state local mandates either lifted overruled new state government. Covid already rails point; couldn’t worse shape going GOP control.

Without support businesses based in-person services, odds surviving this. Even area doesn’t officially lockdown, covid outbreak among staff force closure days weeks, rampant unchecked local spread kill foot traffic fear spreads. Lose enough customers costs money open. becomes de facto lockdown, one end sight.  long incorporate proper distancing, masks, probably every household getting pizza fast-food meal instead sharing food households well, think much danger small outdoors gathering. I'd still also quarantine fullest extent possible weeks make sure, too. really can't careful surge. totally agree certain party giving bailouts states close, DeSantis would change tune real fast.

You right though supporters play huge part. Especially think hoax. Trump Cuomo agreed this. 
To day, De Blasio, shit he's done, shut NYC schools Cuomo bitching it. 
Cuomo said he'd close schools 10% positivity. 
DeBlasio said wanted Cuomo close indoor dining gyms Cuomo said no. 
Over NY, hellhole. Schools testing people exposed, theyre told ""get test time"" King Cuomo. That's exactly happen. Right gave people 600 dollars week extra work, lol. Yeah think countries already said healthcare frontline workers top priority. Yeah, ACL reconstruction surgery also delayed months first shutdown - bad terms pain yours, but, still! sorry :( prescription test? Wouldn’t technically pathology request? 

Meh fuck things sent en mass every home bio&amp;tech vaccine pfizers missing something data substantial seems? 8 patients 170 given actual drug, rest given placebos.... you’d need least 20 infections cure rate 95%. confused skeptical  Por que los dos? say walking Taco Bell. People stupid. Homer Simpson dissolving hedge equivalent. Responsible looks like US government prioritizes economy

The US government passes laws handed lobbyists work corporate interests... yes, US govt prioritizes economy. else, matter what. Again? people personally know said second infection significantly worse first. 3 month span infections. PuReLy PoLiTiCaL pOsTs. Dumbass bot almost like find united leader states. even call president. bad one election. They’re releasing new album soon :D Canada.  fair, there's lot things willing pay cash. family lives over, say thing me. entire world changed point. It’s shocking really Economically, 2008 horrific. don’t know working adult happened pretty much every field, kind regardless economic status, floor opened up. awful.

The reason haven’t got (yet) time fed everything could try avert it- outpacing 2008 recovery spending threefold. 

However, key word *yet*. think we’re living economic lie right shitcan winter close Q1 21 dire straits. hope I’m wrong doubt it. person talks, vocal cords produce fine aerosol. person infected covid, viral particles incorporated aerosol, persist hours settling. Current research suggests good analogy cigarette smoke: could smell person's cigarette, they're also able infect backfired, unfortunately allies realized yet. I'd imagine vaccine comes out, states see cases get better blue areas do. Get difference skepticism cynicism. Darn. think Trump got exactly wanted election. obviously never cared much job president. gets continue grift without job. sounds awesome. Thanksgiving within last years stayed home myself, ate cheesy noodles watched movies cat. going winter death.  correct. RNAse prevalent cells. Though, notable exceptions. Honestly, Crash Course Biology best. single thing said incorrect.  stop bothsiderism crap.  CDC updated recommendations masks. information date. Quality masks worn correctly protect wearer addition protecting others. regardless, everyone wore masks public would protected wear it. long, even they're calling Trump one three mentioned above, also community. 
link [Monroe woman catches Covid twice same, built gaming PC bought bunch games haha I'm full quarantine mode right now. American looks like US government prioritizes economy believes herd immunity. people die important economy, opinion. 

No, people die 79-80+ years old average life expectancy 1-2 months even without covid. 

In reality thing we've done actually works reduce deaths extra precautions older people nursing homes. That's caused deaths biggest spikes early days, notably NYC. 

The US people 65 years age countries people. look Trump's Coronavirus Task Force telling people Michigan 'rise up' COVID-19 restrictions. 

Why people want livelihoods destroyed? 

They surrender accept ruined, right? double tragic experience e.g. 1918 shows hard early lockdowns ultimately benefit economy more.

Lock downs prisoners 

Quarantines sick people. 

Either way delays spread, stop it, despite clickbait headlines country area ""beating covid"" 

.... discover new cluster. know Dr. Fauci gone insane. He's hero works tirelessly save lives government care people elected serve protect.

I know people think science based consensus instead objective fact unfortunately short supply.

Which temperature testing struck valid ad hoc covid test stop numerous municipalities demanding businesses it. That’s unfair Mr. Crocker fairies real. Correct, [believe referring Funnily enough remember first encounter virus sometime early January CBC radio (is second time I've posted this?), going program ""new coronavirus emerging China"". get chance actually listen headline worried since always fear kind disease breakout, made point check r/worldnews later see anything going on. see anything couple days assumed probably something relating cattle really mundane. rest history. You’re sheep blindly believing everything says without proof..you sheep. /s COVID September still struggling get back normal activity. Used cycle 50-75 miles week, get pretty pooped feel chest tightness 2 mile walk. Working strength training recover might worth seeing doc persists much longer. Sigh. hard time believing functioning financial industry political brains unaware fast bring house down. Maybe giving much credit.  feel like must hidden benefit them.

So thing is... know, care. house goes get buy assets pennies dollar like post 2007/8. They're going lose money; they're going make even backs regular peoples' suffering.

Financial news blaring alarms Fed stimulus thing keeping house cards intact months now. know. total icu capacity? Anyone know? can't remember read months ago. 6 generations, spreading like wildfire. People see danger. care. within peoples risk takes going without mask can't know time go without mask. Masks work.

Masks protecting virus. 

Most people get infected also get infected public places would wearing mask. Fauci estimated vaccine available general public April five months away. depending many vaccines get approved, could middle late March. We’re almost there! considered zoom? wondering goin you! bet that's gotta feel like massive weight shoulders probably feels lot better carrying yourself. I'm happy hear husband react poorly shut try convince otherwise. 

Putting hardest step proud bold! husband lucky strong wife look comes time make choice stand firm together. 

It heart breaking know world gonna look like start recover this. know get wits intact, we're much stronger give credit for!

Much love staying strong setting example. little particles matter well could saved little particles closest &lt;3 I'm rooting guys!! No, current model ""Don't shit ignore problem"" working great. ~ Sincerely, Texas resident. true spread everywhere. many times seen concern long-term effects brought up. [archive link anyone trouble accessing article Why? play fantasy. know likely win.  kind Thanksgiving. Yes, I'm thankful have, please leave alone. tp stuff drama New Zealand shows early shut benefitted economy too. No, not. Anyone says purely voluntary either misinformed lying.

Like, sure, voluntary. refuse get put hole change mind.

US prisons hell. national security concerns? military bases part. Yeah National Guard units get free runway airport, but... I'm seeing major national security concerns. anything, fewer civilian aircraft air makes national security easier.  explained part meant understanding measures actually make difference. example, Osterholm said seen data closing bars 10 p.m. helpful closing all. 

And won't.. limiting timeframe one active _reduces_ effective distance. Time one part time-space equation defines distribution physical-plane objects, including human popuations. 2008 worse? 11 accurate? seems like it’s right, actually happens we’re lower herd immunity levels? I’d assume viruses mutate faster others, type vaccine get may effective mutations?  ""no one damn thing"" think meant ""everyone things outside"" hope people realize isn’t “backwoods”, “poor whites”, “militia members”, “church good republicans” support wild non science based covid thoughts.. I’ve seen first hand hospital CEO’s “management” positions full people otherwise bright successful deny true scope virus. Hoping Americans recover someday.. Well people still confining houses stay safe, mean they're free virus left house except essential stuff? Hence major factor spreading virus? us go without 0 days anyway. Worse case scenario take work wait 2 weeks supply chains catch Still waiting facts 😊 posting propaganda doesn’t count Put bandaid bride nose partially mask make seal. seems like horrible actually dangerous idea. crazy anti-science people would probably spit face attempted confront them. really wanted large park amphiteater, wear masks, everyone go home right stay really far away. 

It complicated.   Interesting. COVID back September suspect allergies right now.. may worth grabbing test. one cloth mask actually paid wear fun design 

The two issued work guess state-wide? live San Diego, that's definitely case since county mandated masks back May. mean we're already dealing confrontation things telling customers carts clean vs dirty, greeted someone door berate wearing mask it'll ""kill me"" take off, handing masks customers get pissed threaten us tell us they'll ""sue"" store. Honestly there's much I've dealt point I'd rather managers kind backbone instead catering maskless idiots. Everything's bigger Texas! I'm truly amazed gall show faces. 3 grandparents sick odds end killing grandparent sideshow pretty high...  Perhaps. That’s Oxford/AstraZeneca trial uses existing proven vaccine unrelated illness placebo; induces similar side effects. actually serious we'd lockdown US upon re-opening make vaccinated requirement employed. first sentence point. second sentence gaining karma.  Oh. wasn’t previously case? Perfect. right. They're gonna paint nurses put lives risk villains order respect demands shame live world need medical staff organizations people take care ( us) absolute shit job taking care . true. either way- lowest rates significant amount time. one biggest summer tourist destinations 29 people. 🤷🏼‍♀️ that. Trump turn whole thing would re-elected instead sulking one-term wonder.  years we’ll communicate bosses using AR Holograms VR Headsets know 3 people virus late July got October. second time worse three them. 20’s luckily experienced flu-like symptoms. live Louisiana. varies substantially based region listen carefully, said event ‘to be’ outside little mea culpa. guess didn’t even realize actually outside reported media. So, based efficacy, percent US population needs get vaccine get back normal? Tomorrow’s headline: Moderna vaccine 96% Effective final tests” seriously cannot believe people humourless person I'm replying to. No.

It's signal end biggest public health crisis lifetimes coming soon. hate use clichéd metaphor, basically D-Day covid. huge event that's going improve almost everyone's lives. ... forgot mention I'm US, Trump Fauci talk 100% irrelevant me. know vaccine make country (Pfizer, Sputnik, etc etc), whichever is, I'm getting *right away.*

I'm one people affected lockdowns almost all, mind all, neither family. could go another year, easy. I'll let people *really* need get vaccine go get first, meanwhile I'll take time really take good look world vaccine like decide later. threw ""a year"" arbritary number, really, could even less, maybe more? really wanna get it, goes well people around me, I'll definitely get it. *Just right away...* irrelevant long time now. Trump solved issue bleach injections. Go google type ""sweden covid deaths"" look development since spring. Compare european lockdown mask mandate countries (UK, Belgium, France etc) see yourself.

Just look data judge. Insightful, thanks link recall exact numbers start vaccinating elderly think people return normal constitute covid deaths. us reading post, covid dangerous parents grandparents ourselves. protected would keep behaving differently every year? vaccine prepared go emergency authorization, normal procedure good news? Ugh feel like anti vaxxers going keep sub relevant Yes, I'm familiar plan. said seriously doubt they'll go it. really important Talk good soul! 

She also spent tons money out-of-pocket feeding housing victims fire Seveir County well feeding emergency workers. ever living saint, is. Even response focused excited done side got help great shows kindness. I'll transatlantic flight 29 December. I'm even taking mask eat. I'll bit hungry what. worked mere minutes away am. exciting stuff. Nice explanation. Makes total sense. Thank you! knowledge unapproved vaccines China vaccinating people with?? would stop wearing mask?

My fiance already decided big fat never. Fuck wearing mask more.

Pro:

Not needing smile people.
Can mouth mean things children
Don't catch assholes shit viruses breathing target

Cons:

It's warm sometimes
Glasses fog up

It's really win win. look google map Texas see DFW, El Paso, Houston worst. live Austin seem keeping lower matter wrong moves change given way spreads. Austin businesses supportive mask regulations distancing far helps.

Tbh though moving hard quarantine while. really depends potential roommate's exposure potential job exposure. I'd think better homeless options. AZ seem well right depending live either. there’s mutation, mRNA vaccine still protect vs traditional vaccine injects dead virus? mean normal people Typically expect vaccine produce immune response 2 weeks. Best case scenario vaccines moves mass production March, ending pandemic. long shot least there's hope. Trump claims deal made Pfizer make vaccine free. Pfizer said no. stock continuing call? little more, lads.  Buy rumor sell news. 
 
This kind action fairly typical highly anticipated news ""expected"" investors. expected news get priced months ahead time, additional speculation various reasons - people betting something bigger (""our vaccine 99.99% effective, side effects increased dick size""). inevitably bunch people really know jump last second nudge price up.  makes sense would go continue test updating efficiency hour hour something still tested everyday sales tactic plain simple. 

Pfizer Moderna competing important lucrative contract recent history, stand make absurd amount money they're going whatever need win contract. I’m skeptical best.

I covid-19 earlier year; wasn’t bad. 

Test came back negative, person interacted later found covid-19 anti-bodies now. thought flu. (In early Feb, lines up).

And again. 

I don’t know much vaccine going help antibodies don’t mean anything. 

I pray works. I’m holding breath. trial period vaccine also unethically fast. don’t feel like they’ve time accurately measure it’s impact reinfection road. Fire vaccine mills! Lumley, shovel dogs!


*full disclosure: know vaccines made. true Liu Kang. Ah, yes wife autoimmune issues understand concern.

I think unlikely *late developing* (rather long-lasting) issues occur vaccine, simply seen vaccination general. Sheesh man fuck even get mess Lets hope goes away doesnt become yearly thing. Same. seen friends since beginning since staffing Covid-ICU first wave attending ER keeps high risk encounters people test positive screening asymptomatic full precautions. I'm terrified I'll one causes someone care die permanent disability. draining face covid everyday, also able spend time people care about. Yeah, think economy runs sounds like. real question. paying govern? makes absolutely sense. wil continue advance great.

If government, say, Germany, would also fund continue explore prepare future rapid vaccine development emerging viral diseases, well potential vaccination nuisance viruses get every year. done COVID, get booster shot. 70? Even caught sniffles-19, probably even get sniffles. Gates promoting Microsoft

Gates substantially divested Microsoft zero day-to-day involvement. believe need test, get test. Bill Gates gave new numbers information gathered nanochips control brains!!!!!! federal state governments think Covid mitigation efforts. Peachy. case probably acceptable risk since alternative waiting additional years millions dead, right, we're rolling dice trying balance speed vs. safety. U need kn95 level mask always suspect someone asks ""genuine question"" i'll address non-scientific part....the vaccine would use truly confirmed covid basis test given today someone exposed covid 3 days ago certain degree accuracy, person exposed 4 days ago accuracy different, 5 days ago accuracy test still even different. 

one problem testing know exactly day 0 someone's case count forward tested perfect day. mentioned early pandemic, testing could ramped point everyone could take quick test morning work would pandemic problems right now.  Yeah would tough Funny getting downvoted mentioning it. I've negative comments mentioning South Korean case mask wearing shown protect wearers, heart abnormalities seen recovered patients. everyone likes science today. 

Article links paper, seen felt proud part little seed money hopefully grow something great help heal world,"" said. ""I'm proud girl today know anything something that's going help us crazy pandemic."" 

""That little seed money"" $1 million. really national treasure. I'm... glad agree?  70 million...you mean 20% US population 330 million, like said?   you’re suggesting forced vaccinations? vaccination rushed market? company $2.3bn fines unlawful misguided practices. Asking friend.  Think number trucks ship many non-crucial items around world every day, though. 
If dry ice containers they're modular thrown old truck (as opposed actual freezer trucks need fitted compressors such). matter truck space even dry ice amount Walmart miss shipment pool noodles ice cream carts let stock melt. 
I'm looking seemingly minor thing can't commandeered another industry. basic terms, ""vaccine"" copy something looks (to immune system) enough like virus trigger what's called ""adaptive immune response"". takes two weeks, happens mostly bone marrow lymph nodes. that, body alert viruses look like vaccine effectively kill contact.

This happens time, part natural biological systems. Anytime randomly feel achy, feverish, tired, there's decent chance feeling body react viral infection never noticed. 

That makes exposing something low-risk: there's already safeguards ""designed"" system keep something dangerous.


Drugs... there's lot different kinds drugs, general introduce new chemical body that's designed bind chemical directly cells.

Because humans complicated biological machines, hard predict happen result. Unlike immune system, chemicals evolved part biology. might deplete resources time, interact something scientists never thought check, otherwise disrupt normal functioning body. way much riskier. he's diplomat opted isolation home. vaccine need 100% effective 95% close enough? Right. Big Pharma keep drugs patients who’s lives depend it, guys getting punished hand sanitizer? don’t agree prices, wouldn’t buy either. Also, fewer people sick covid, we'll medical personnel equipment help sick. Wa Qld = Australia? know *is* role then? better hope nobody ever invades florida Yeah even though case deaths likely drop SHIT TON still objectively amazing news matter end? go like now. said they're hesitant, HESITANT, get it. nice. think infected already need vaccine? Calling devil's advocates: concerned about? legend. I’ve staying home leave work back home. don’t want put customers risk RemindMe! 2 months Sure, WA QLd requiring 28 days new cases innterstate borders open , that’s elimination...

I fingers crossed. I'm student could use extra $$. really wanted LeetCode membership. problem businesses like grocery stores walmart told cut hours slow spread, actually increase spread. Walmart open 24/7 customers spread across 24 hours, 12 hours day basically force stores twice crowded needed food going go everyone needed food go shorter window means less distancing greater infection rate.  I'm seeing stupidity city near said bar stay open close 11pm.. Okay.. people going go bar forced narrow window open time means people bar time. type stupidity never seems stop. long going allow places open need open long possible people spread cut hours cram together.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* You’ll go r/china_flu go find early threads. Back didn’t know coronavirus. knew deadly flu China videos people collapsing streets people rushing hospitals— lock down.

Edit: fix subreddit name make China like new first world? 1) ""The difference don’t think needs done don’t think locking citizens guilty crimes ethical.""

You necessary knowledge expertise claim that. public health experts ones determine using science evidence.

2) ""I genuinely can’t fathom anyone thinks good idea. bring tons collateral damage actually find worse virus people""

Funny Taiwan, Thailand, New Zealand Vietnam, ""collateral damage"" happen. Instead, much better lives compared places world since need lock long. lockdown, plus virus worry about.

3) ""the fact virus you’d consider exceptionally deadly.""

More 250,000 dead US counting, think deadly? Wow.

4) ""I totally favor shielding vulnerable (who wish shielded - many probably want isolated away others) letting everyone get back life.""

No, stupid plan. Even shield vulnerable, letting virus spread among everyone else restrictions lead thousands getting sick dying.

5) ""There infrastructure place people wish avoid contact - curbside pickup, takeout, cashless transactions, apps everything, etc.""

This actually supports arguments. Since options available, people going much congregating indoor places.

6) ""this elimination strategy particular circumstances makes sense.""

Yeah, US eliminate highly contagious virus sickened 11 million people killed 250,000? makes sense all!

7) ""There uniform response federalist system""

Irrelevant. President sensible person, he/she would coordinated national response customized state's needs. tailor state's guidelines simply one-size-fits-all approach. fact, Biden claims planning do. US Federal type goverment excuse response. Otherwise, might well say Federal government worthless. ban gatherings two households like Germany right now.

Then police patrolling force throwing fines left right absolutely right here, basically changes nothing. another rendition DeWine says something, listen time, going turn car around, damn it. (or something)

I see making places like gyms restaurants busy later night bit crowded day, great. (I used 1-2 grocery shopper really miss it. Though really miss grocery shopping point.)

My view make much difference people already stupid. might go home bar 10, ones want keep going meet someone's house, order damned.

I wish surrounded idiots. Things going back pre covid days ever.

Ps. Climate change going make covid look like kiddies tea party.

People can't even stay home put mask weeks. What's going happen dramatically permanently change lifestyles stop burning fossil fuels?  no, brainwashed man named Alienwallbuilder is??  don’t know, something tells type person denies downplays risk virus probably type person believes 9/11 conspiracy theories...”fire can’t melt steel” nonsense. people us along, they’ve never able cause much tangible damage before.

IMHO, folks can’t receive adequate care hospitals overrun COVID-19 cases counted COVID-19 related deaths. moderna Pfizer good news, expect vaccinated expect long term side effects vaccines? obsessing impeachment proceedings December, didn’t know time. first week January, netflix sent notification new “short series” called Pandemic. binged watched suddenly obsessed prepping.... little know.... couple weeks later would read Reddit city called Wuhan going go quarantine Chinese New Year—that got attention!

I lived hard hit neighborhood NYC spring nonstop ambulance sirens day night made impossible ignore. 6 months later tell city worst (spoiler, ones going bars hiding burbs then). imagine similar thing going happen states. CIA propaganda isn’t convincing anyone bad ideology. 25,000 children starve day capitalist nations, yet support it. Capitalism kills 100 million every 5 years. Yeah exactly. need large enough percentage population vaccinated overall viral load significantly hindered. Flatten curve=/=get rid virus. Gyms great people’s physical health. everyone sit home day (this sub’s wet dream) actually good physical mental health people  That’s I’m thinking. Close everything doesn’t involve keeping animals humans alive. Put restrictions place well grocery stores they’re open 8 hours day, three days week. know! that? dinner also probably 200k 2 years Sen.

Teams exist, something else would (e.g. Zoom, Skype Business, whichever company decided fill hole Teams currently filling). “Sources also say collector’s bundle include Half Life 3, Winds Winter.” think former administration Fauci would front center things would never gotten remotely bad. messed testing rollout early, realized needed lockdown, calculated expensive would spent next several months trying convince people nothing happening. Melbourne peaked 3%. boggles mind. numbers come county, ( operative word) based residence. 

Culbertson reported 8 cases today, Hudspeth reported 12. California Texas really. human race shit destroying world. vaccine going make things worse. earth cannot sustain throwing it. Wipe tear humanity away, misplaced. developer, idiocy userbase must taken account. part challenge. basis guessing this?

Let's see thing plays out. cared. happy cake day intrepid unstoppable fucker help 257,000 died covid year? death toll goes everyday. I’m sorry happened you. hope recover soon! Really messed that. thing makes sense me.  Oh wow concert? went concert March 5th. last time many people building No. need greedy americans doubling vaccines worried 4% difference effect herd immunity anyway. reason retail sucks, magazines zombies.

VCs demand profit.. gut profitable parts discarded everything else. Boom. see USA? 

I know do!

And know you’re looking away... 

Just saying.  nearly close temporally black death yet think unaware potential effects disease? Look Spanish flu, 600k+ dead, time many fewer Americans, yet constitutional upheavals. Imagine handing govt power ending another Trump, worse, I'd wary creating turnkey dictatorship country guess vaccine starts rolling Moderna possibly Pfizer/BioNTech types late November 2020. First people treated: first responders people “essential” jobs. Since work State California “essential” department, could inoculated end year. 💉 still ""professors"" still objecting lockdowns want money, going huge problem Canadian forestry industry booming thanks this. need curfew reasons leave house America fucked assumed kid traveling working professional can't afford move parent abusive except away.

But, I’d luck said , COVID.  People care instant gratification. sum up... wear freaking mask. coronavirus antibodies 

Surely least 1 blood / tissue sample used confirm this? Considering papers suggesting coronavirus strains common cold provide [immunity speculative. Eight days without local transmission. always good thing anyway Under-financing healthcare common problem Poland years everybody knows that. COVID made worst. Understaffed hospitals, enough money equipment, much lower wages rest Europe. Ok hereby reverse it, read username closely! *Eastbound intensifies* Okay, hear you. 

But think virus longer exist everyone wears masks? doesn’t seem much evidence that. think problem runs deeper that. tend assume covid deniers faulty information (the virus real) make rational decisions given bad information (masks needed).

In fact, large number people simply rational organized minds all. “beliefs” blend superstition, hearsay random free-association. actions follow beliefs predictable way.

It matters won’t able use rational arguments persuade irrational minds. need understand makes people tick better discourage anti-social impulses.

I think option explicitly non-rational forms communication influence. Think rituals, symbols, mythical storytelling peer pressure. 

It doesn’t feel great treat people like idiots need manipulated foe good. treating people like rational adults clearly going get us nowhere. Federal government power order manufacturing PPE, months so.

They didn't, are. exactly going tell car people going party apart car people getting groceries? hurts say this, China might onto something. here’s numbers far:

Pfizer’s ~10 million people December
Moderna ~ 10 million people December

Production capacity around 25 million/month those.


Oxford like 12.5 million ready go. 


So would 32.5m (10%) December.

About 15-25 million virus. (~15%)

That’s already 25% US population.

And month you’re adding another 10-15%

So January: 35-40%
February: 45-55%
March: 55-70%
April: 65-85%
May: 75-100%
June: 85%
July: 95%

Obviously back envelope map numbers change depending manufacturing constraints when/if vaccines get approved. snooze bait  shutdown without giving people money. that.

Like millions, I’ve lost business money, along things can’t get back, can’t see way things get back “normal”. it’s Fall 2021 🙏🏼 Disjointed must professional term FUBAR. think optimistic believe we'll blow rising cases know percentage vulnerable vaccinated.

Restrictions form going exist even threat totally gone. one know restrictions vaccine keeping things together, we'll ease way this. varying concerns every level.

**February:** Healthcare workers 10 million vulnerable people vaccinated. There's still risk COVID unvaccinated vulnerable population. keep isolating.

**April:** 30-40 million vaccinated, many still waiting second dose waiting vaccine become effective second dose. Cases still high. uncertainty much vaccine prevents spread vs. mitigates severe disease. keep isolating.

**June:** 100 million vaccinated, adverse events national news. lot people holding vaccine vulnerable people can't get vaccine safety reasons. Cases still high falling due vaccination summer. Restrictions lifted somewhat, one knows much safe. Republican states resume normalcy quicker Democratic states. Democratic states cite thousands dying Republican states. Republican states say deaths worth economic gains/return normalcy.

**August:** Pretty much back normal, things like concerts packed bars trickling back, depending state/country. governments calling masks remain part daily life cases drop negligible levels. There's concern vaccine compliance, longevity protection, upcoming winter. Return normalcy becomes choice make, definitive reality. either feel guilty moving life, knowing problem 75% solved, keep isolating watch majority world move on.

**2021 beyond:** Every year concerns vaccine compliance, rising cases, possible vaccine-evading mutations, etc... becomes normal thing occupancy limits mask requirements certain times year. Media outlets hype every emerging infectious disease, keeping anxious constantly worried COVID 2.0.

If hoping wake headline saying, ""We're back normal!"" going disappointed. waiting vaccination, waiting mid-summer healthy months fully effective. waiting vulnerable vaccinated, ""vulnerable"" whether they've vaccinated nebulous. vaccine starts widespread rollout, end pretty much whenever decide you. France past peak curfew lockdown working. think 50 state thing downfall America. arbitrary borders, arbitrary political leverage, arbitrary bordering groups people. unnaturally sized useless amount them. can't run ventilators run people work first. *points forehead smugly* That's true, rolled dice half crapped out.

Explain virtually every non-authoritarian country (and somewhat hesitate even include AU list, given insane shit happened Victoria), deck stacked massively favor, failed eradicate virus spite ""exponentially greater costs"". get increased chance surviving extra generation two, similar amount proportional effort.

I think understand ""proportional effort"" reason (a) willpower, (b) close borders countries endemic keep out. Instead, stay pandemic purgatory vaccines heavily rolled out.

If ""willpower"" mean ""willingness send millions people unemployment line possibly homeless shelters we've trashed economy,"" yes, pretty significant obstacle. good luck explaining perspective academics cushy tenured Wuhan epicentre, case count never know. Think made wrong call striving containment?

I think containment waste time extremely counterproductive community transmission gains certain amount momentum. Keeping hospitals becoming overloaded rationale even warrants consideration. Aiming complete eradication, though, lunacy. cure indeed worse disease - fact people holding authoritarian regime model rest us emulate speaks that.  numerous articles COVID affecting women's employment. even 2020, women STILL expected majority childcare. woman forced quit job, affect rest life. probably harder get back workforce. get less social security and/or retirement put less money system. going right putting progress women made workforce back decades.  doesn’t MN tougher restrictions?

Remember California showed trump wrong mandating strict lock policies even strict mask enforcement? 

Me either, probably remembered illegal, unenforceable lacks popular support. 

In real world Gavin Newsome caught dinner large party, indoors Michelin restaurant recently Nancy Pelosi indoor salon scandal time advocating inability salons stay open. masks work somewhat, reality, 100% unless China barricade people inside homes/apartments.

It's great see bit cognitive dissonance restart thinking wheels inside generation's head. Yep suggest drying b-hole spraying water? You’d find company willing sell you.  ... transform zombies won’t die air strikes bites ass. You’d make good fiction writer No. mention tests high false-negative rate. People still believe vaccines cause autism. Good luck getting listen this. become prevalent social media people seem accepting fact. Unfortunately, people told us years, internet first started becoming common, believe anything read internet. Seems forgot message. want equivalent 9/11 death toll every day that's right americans!

Framers constitution: rules get thrown convenient, right? Well miss you? They're already slamming us ""lazy"" ""not wanting work"", can't imagine case. mostly Biden, bet he'll leave entire operation absolute mess. seem ignore fact many elderlys don’t even smart phone either delivery pickup shopping unclear, history countries giving citizens first priority. downer, that's optimistic. First limited emergency use approval late December two companies promised enough vaccine ~10 million people end 2020 early 2021. likely need 70%+ population get it, 2 shots immunity. we're talking 10-20 million get first shot January second February. Maybe another 30-40 million get shot March, second shot April. It'll summer pop CVS get vaccine normal, healthy individual. meant credible he's meant fallacy authority think consensus objective fact science demands. Immunity individualized response means there's always going outliers ends. Let's say subsequent research finds say, 50% people immunity lasts years. might also mean 10% people immunity &lt;1 year 1% people immunity &lt;6 months 0.1% people immunity &lt;3 months. 0.1% 100M people still 100,000 people going get reinfected, thus difficult find 1000s stories people getting infected twice months gap between.

But anecdotal data relevant grand scheme disease progression. 1% people vulnerable getting reinfected, pushes herd immunity threshold 70% 71%. 

What we're seeing mass amounts reinfection places like NE USA indicates almost everyone got infected first time retained immunity long. remember getting hella excited whenever mine would go business trips. presence dreadful couldn’t imagine would happen 8 year old time like this, couple hours got back school got back work peace growing seems like you’ve gone wanting takeout delivery close 10 pm (which dumb fuck way) wanting shut altogether put welfare indefinitely. That’s ridiculous.  doesn’t lost! Think parts thanksgiving meaningful still those.

You always safe distance food/desert swap long friendly phone call thanksgiving morning!  think that's incentive every vaccine covid came along would had? Stop asking questions take get :) 1) ""Wrong. totally different Taiwan New Zealand it’s even worth comparing.""

Of course US different New Zealand Taiwan. that's excuse coordinated national public health plan. main reason US control, people. Also, funny ignored Thailand Vietnam, population-dense share borders countries, giving disadvantage. Yet still successfully contained virus.

2) ""New Zealand spent day driving six hours maybe saw three cars lol. people.""

New Zealand urban areas lots people too. drove area less people mean densely populated areas. higher risk outbreaks. like go angle, realize US rural areas people too, yet areas also getting ravaged covid.

3) ""I don’t want house arrest haven’t committed crime.""

There's difference wanting lockdown understanding needs done. want lockdown, however, recognize necessary first step containing outbreak. virus control, moving around needlessly without precautions endangers people, yes, becomes crime circumstances.

4) ""Sorry offends you!""

There's difference getting offended thinking wrong. confuse two. basically calling someone idiot asking question telling he's stupid asking. :) lmao.

Happy 9 month anniversary ""flatten curve""! fucking moron. real thing always better vaccine.

When ""have real thing"" also infect others, risk death organ damage, suffer effect ""the real thing"" gets you. vaccine worry that.

Good post. I'm left I'm definitely hysteria calls authoritarian measures. all. technically island Island mostly island.

Hawaii stay closed, someone apparently realized without tourist money they're Mississippi sea. Nice I've little gaming myself. Lot people dying, lots smart people working fast could one become famous save many lives, also make lot money. U.S. schools fine, actually. kids fine international assessments - top, usually middle. 

The problem huge amount inequality. that's fault schools. couldn’t even manage national response Australia, despite begging do-nothing federal government SOMETHING, ANYTHING LOVE GOD, I’m sure much luck US have.

You begged government get authoritarian response? Aww shucks moved wisco told dui “right passage”. think cruise boomer thing. younger generation don’t really care cruise.  lock properly...6 weeks house travel all...only one person household store...we practiced proper physical distancing..the fucking USA full self entitled assholes paying now...and biggest dumbest asshole lives White House. government supported us listened science. rest world locked properly...wore masks...physically distanced stopped making excuses like whiney little bitches would beat too. Hawaii could isolated leaders mattered damn...listen science stop talking people taking away freedoms getting fucking old  begs question bluest states proven trump wrong themselves?

Oh yeah illegal, unenforceable lacks popular support. Sweet, free labour animation ends right things exploding, really leaves suspense. I'd like see another map deaths instead cases. positive note guy said, advances healthcare mean there’s lot outpatient surgery procedures don’t necessitate stay hospital, meaning less beds needed. course. Fauci know? mean he's got almost 50 years experience working Public Health Epidemiology, even Facebook page?

The average reddit armchair civics expert I'd assume realize suggestions illegal, unenforceable lacks popular support. According estimates, means 20% ND infected month ago, considering IFR 0.5% takes approx month die COVID. 


EDIT: add IFR go ND's hospitals capacity, serious COVID patients get degreaded care point on. That's fuckin crazy man. country shouts rooftops we'll never forget lives lost 9/11, sure seem ton people give shit hell lot people died pandemic. China gonna say proof start Wuhan. Aged... I’m Wisconsin trust me, people parties large gatherings awhile. probably effect states Shit like makes sense me. vast majority people home 10pm is.  get something need less crowded times better off. 

Walmart closed stores accross US night. That's want shop. one damn store. Dumbest thing ever. first closing like 5pm. Great idea, lets pack many people store smaller window time. Every walmart I've last 8 months busier I've ever seen day. Highly unlikely. outside observer, probably half world interested this, ~~United~~ States America probably never be. concerned contact tracing. invasion privacy government use cell phone location capability restrict movement people quarantine? Yep. Trump dr says irrelevant rational people.  Okay, time take seriously. It’s getting personal   Lol can't even post intelligent reply get deleted.  another thread Disney profits last year. Natrurally fell due lock down, closing parks, movies getting released... etc.

However, look stock trend, pretty much remained same. Almost like investors know that, point, virus settle, vaccines get released things get back 'normal'.

Too bad gov leaders seem foresight / faith. many people need invite middle deadly pandemic get 300 show up?


Hopefully put people organized garbage jail. love much. Fantastic!

Step privilege bubbles second, please. **""More worthy people?""**, kind asinine statement that? doctors nurses get sick unable work, take care sick? 

Did actually read aticle posted? answers question, reason getting it.  work? Hospital? curious don’t answer don’t want fair, heard outbreaks chess tournaments far.   we? Sure seem way 8 months in. Yeah Trump STILL saying need wear mask. gives shit lied first keep people hording PPE gear like everything else. Fuck people selling hand sanitizer $75 bottle online. yeah, let's tell people make masks. I'm sure selfish pricks always buy everything out. like nurses doctors wearing GARBAGE BAGS work federal government decided going help states all. Fuck much denial?

Because American culture breeds dumb fucks. Mitch needs dose shit Well duh. wonder Mitch McConnell taking news shared meme China building field hospital less week, laughing comparison i5 construction near Tacoma dome. idea coronavirus time :( it’ll bitter sweet one pops back up. know virus ignored contagious least two months China went lockdown - believe study, ignored **four** months. theory makes sense, think works since also terrible outbreaks (at source well parts country) well allowed travel. ones set contact tracing, quarantining travelers. seem work even strictest countries Europe.

A good reason low numbers much east Asia countries simply outbreak begin (i.e. Vietnam). I'm sure that, coupled tight travel restrictions helped keep numbers low.

Hell, Japan, model etiquette social distancing, **119k** cases. I’ve 23 years it’s lifestyle me. I’m currently working strong enough legs burst watermelon open - takes 320 lbs force. Ain’t gonna happen body weight squats home. think state state response inherently wrong. Australia example done good job dealing virus implementing mostly state/territory level jurisdiction dealing it.

A big part ability close borders states outbreaks spread across country might even possible US probably unlikely happen anyway. Yea time virus mutates it’s get worst it’s killing everything path. wasn’t live die. stimulus sure is. Obviously top job unemployment.  Well, could theoretically give future date one allowed leave home 2 weeks straight. would allow time people get supplies governments provide food can’t afford preparation 2 week period. worldwide quarantine eliminate virus

This, course impossible. Emergencies, people can’t afford lose 2 weeks income, essential workers, etc. prevent this. mention isn’t 2 weeks food readily available every person world. could also theorize households, virus would move person person time still contagious person 2 weeks. 

Covidzero? Can’t blame trying guess. MegaAcumen right.

3.2M people would 1% population, 0.01%

If 3.2M people 0.01% (0.0001) population would 33 billion people US.

Unless I'm missing something...you might want delete comment. could understand non-financial-industry people thinking way. everyone wearing masks actually makes safe go shopping traveling. Whereas, see, ignoring mask wearing causes increased sickness death. Neither good traveling shopping. 

So people beholden Wall Street theoretically pushing mask wearing. 

It's good thought, really reason anti-mask, short-term gain mentality really gone deep end. Orange idiot fucked response covid badly might real cohesion happens. Fuck idiot orange cancer  actually first appointment trial (didn't actually get shot yet computers down). said that's common question get. Technically put study paperwork might get vaccine study ends 2 years. 

But since intent pursue EUA soon possible, unblind study early anyway, point offer people placebo group (assuming works approved) fair you, preppers obviously extreme side things, think people outside community would probably same. take seriously outset either. think people did. actually flew Southeast Asia weeks back February, seemed stupid time turns safer US. correct.  factor anti-mask ""stay home scared"" crowd considered.  

Well, fact possibility death thing fear... want worry life long heart and/or lung issues this. yes, damn straight I'm taking precautions, even ""relatively safe""! explain people, can’t understand them. ""jab"" British term?     Yes. avoid situation. anyone hasn’t read yet, also recommend reading fantastic *The Atlantic* article [the ever increasing toll COVID societal disregard taking healthcare here’s recent *The Atlantic* article [imminent hospital staffing useful resources tracking crushing surge hospitalizations facing (especially Midwest).

 **COVID-19: Vollständige Auslastung zertifizierter und anerkannter Intensivbettenkapazitäten** 

Basel, 17. November 2020

 Die 876 von der SGI zertifizierten und anerkannten Intensivbetten, die der Schweiz normalerweise zur Behandlung Erwachsener zur Verfügung stehen, sind aktuell praktisch vollständig belegt. Eine Überlastung dieser ordentlichen Bettenkapazitäten konnte bisher zum einen vor allem deshalb verhindert werden, weil vielerorts nicht dringende Eingriffe und Behandlungen verschoben wurden. Zum anderen hat eine Erhöhung der Bettenkapazitäten durch die ohnehin bereits übermässig stark geforderten Teams der Intensivstationen dazu beigetragen, dass die Intensivstationen aktuell nicht schweizweit überlastet sind.

 **Qualitätseinbussen der intensivmedizinischen Behandlung verhindern** 

Die schweizerischen Intensivstationen sind der Grenze ihrer ordentlichen Bettenkapazitäten, tun aber ihr Möglichstes, um diesen im Vergleich zur ersten COVID-19- Welle erhöhten Zustrom kritisch kranken Patientinnen und Patienten zu bewältigen und auch künftig alle kritisch kranken Patientinnen und Patienten versorgen zu können. Es ist jedoch von allergrösster Wichtigkeit, die COVID-19-Pandemie jetzt einzudämmen und nicht dringende Eingriffe und Behandlungen schweizweit zu verschieben, um Qualitätseinbussen der intensivmedizinischen Behandlung zu verhindern. Die SGI steht engem Austausch mit den Intensivstationen, nationalen Behörden sowie diversen Organisationen des Gesundheitswesens, um auf Grundlage bisheriger Erkenntnisse und Erfahrungen Massnahmen zu koordinieren und umzusetzen. 

**Nationale Verlegungen als Belastung für Patientinnen, Patienten und Angehörige** 

In den vergangenen Tagen wurden mehrere kritisch kranke Patientinnen und Patienten aufgrund mangelnder intensivmedizinischer Ressourcen andere Kantone oder sogar Sprachregionen verlegt. Diese Verlegungen aus der eigenen Wohnregion sind für die betroffenen Patientinnen und Patienten und für ihre Angehörigen eine grosse Belastung. Nationale Verlegungen sind jedoch notwendig, um allen kritisch kranken Patientinnen und Patienten der Schweiz die bestmögliche intensivmedizinische Behandlung zu ermöglichen. Die SGI bedankt sich bei den Intensivstationen, Spitälern und Kantonen für die gelebte Solidarität und bei den Patientinnen, Patienten sowie Angehörigen für das Verständnis. \[...\] Golfing tweeting. else? go gym around 1am it’s EMPTY. second shift/night owl kind person.

And ideal world, that'd fine. Republican President, majority-Senate, governors, state legislatures, state Supreme Courts, mayors would listen one qualified scientists planet follow fucking advice. aren't, there's nothing it.

As why, well, take pick. personal theory Trump either genuinely (cuz he's dumbass) falsely (because thought it'd hurt chances reelection) downplayed COVID early on, clear wrong, completely incapable admitting that. since president said that, *must* true, entire GOP apparatus (Fox News, GOP politicians, etc.) echoed him.

That's early days, though. continue downplay virus (well, January 20th, point GOP become concerned Dems failing contain it)? probably mix wanting alienate Trump's base (I mean, look election: Fox News disagreeing fraud claims everybody calling traitors), dumbasses, wanting look wishy-washy, preserve economy (stay-at-home orders=bad business).

I'm confused is. proven work application (prior current testing) something new. dog breeds came from. Believe originated Newfoundland water dog. Loyal good boys last point compelling me. vaccine available, becomes matter weighing risks one another.

 \#2 Covid spreading again, none doctors offices allowed ""the patient"" waiting room. ER would probably same.

While waiting triage area, watching main entrance asking people going. handing people masks already one on. 1 person gave girl hard time needed security come escort lady out. There’s also issue long-term health costs turns significant issue. Right Federal Government Insurance companies covering COVID costs. guarantee they’ll cover long term treatment costs. without increasing premiums. imagine it’ll like firefighters trying get 9/11 related long term medical care costs covered. feel like important excerpt study.

""The findings, however, used conclude recommendation everyone wear masks community would effective reducing SARS-CoV-2 infections, trial test role masks source control SARS-CoV-2 infection.""

Essentially, saying lots people already doing. study deals specifically protecting mask wearer. question masks reducing ability infected person spread virus dispute. 

So look like this...

You one 10 people room. One 9 Coronavirus. wear mask none 9 do, study suggests get minimal protection. person Coronavirus wears mask, everyone else get protection. problem cases, know Coronavirus. can't designate person wear mask. Thus, way protect anyone room everyone wear mask. 

There issues study methodology. 

Specifically, referring two things:

- low adherence mask-wearing guidance among participants
- self-reporting results, minimal verification
- absence clinical control group clinical setting

These issues necessarily invalidate results. mean results taken conclusive. like...needs examination. Buy stock dry ice companies lol read article? Except US due fake image puritanism...  likely distributed healthcare system they're employed/affiliated. would easier employers determine much vaccine need received vaccine.

It’s really sad see. Band aid, wash goggles foaming shaving cream vaccine news promising? getting right could close normal spring fully normal summer 2021. correct think something missing?  One last thought - think like this... Covid single type virus, developed vaccine course year. Cancer like virus, tons varieties. cures types cancers before, thousands cancers... even developed cure every year one type cancer strain, 60 years would still drop bucket - think trying get ""cure all"" lot harder appears think like that... like developing vaccine every type virus, possible. Yeah, -- right personally verify something goes body. 
 
You're right, right infect others... I'm allowed ""participate"" society, I'll gladly stay home -- government provide housing food decide vaccine safe then.
 
Don't trust vaccine year all. want see years followup studies things could arise later vaccine. Remember, said SMOKING safe years!! He's (she's?) thinker 43, must truth /s Maybe done Europe. Thankfully done USA mean, come on. argument basically “everyone didn’t make voice heard agrees me”.

I'm glad emerged country handle responsibly. feel selfish idiots allowed pair idiots set tone. great news, reason see Brad Pitt injects World war Z goes face face zombies life turning moment. big FU virus That's possibility, early tell. still even know accurately asymptomatic rate current strain. ""This first time mRNA used fight infectious disease."" 

That sentence make nervous, right? two: next day, woke mild flu similar. Body aches, temp 100 kind tired.

So antivax people look statements like say ""see, vaccines make sick!"", might want specific say something like ""I woke mild flu-like symptoms..."" opposed 'my immune system stop permanent organ damage'? people say things like that, intentionally want create narrative ""both sides basically same.""

Which true (and serves one sides). cut bullshit. Nobody's buying it. Well vaccine's mechanisms specifically concern fertility? reasons believe vaccines specifically affect fertility way? scared general?

I understand people worried new kind medication around long, mechanisms behind well understood even first mRNA vaccine.

They specifically look affects fertility that's something biologists expect would impacted kind vaccine. \*happiness noise\* actually think it’s hilarious y’all bring rare anomalies bash vaccine someone brings high survival rate covid it’s “ughhh don’t say that”

just pick odds want go Lmao fuck comparing corona car crash problem people want freedom expression without suffer consequences. spreading misinformation costs someone life, accept government's freedom prosecute people spread false misleading medical information then. Nah, said lot nothing try appear smart, didn’t realize talking someone who’s actually familiar science.

And honestly wouldn’t know Facebook since don’t follow drivel. get information actual journals reputable news sources; random Redditors think vaccine isn’t safe. genuine question, would care soft anti vaxxers choose get put risk? friends family vaccinated we'll fine right?? US Deaths: 254,902
US Total Cases: 11,743,317  

254,902 ÷ 11,743,317 × 100 = 2.17% mortality / 100) * 150,000 = 3,255 potential daily deaths 

The worst we've seen far around 2,900 one day April.

[source new cases per day today means headlines weeks record breaking numbers deaths. We've what? Nearly 10 straight days around 150,000 new cases?

I guess back weeks chastise us eating (new normal) daily numbers scary enough we're projecting many die christmas make scary again? Could allready States, cases suddenly spiking fast? that, approval vaccine ~14-15 months first jump humans first place... guy isn’t suggesting forced vaccinations way. read article? He’s saying need conversation spreading misinformation. There’s distinction distinction important. Given everything I've read says primary purpose wearing masks prevent spreading others, rather protecting yourself, I'm sure particularly showing anything massively useful. alaska voted add modified ranked choice next time, maybe states follow? hope true, remember, take drug companies' word things. That's *why* FDA. unfortunately, taking FDA's word things moment dubious prospect ever be. 

I'll believe Fauci someone similar stature says true. then, literally PR. could see though. Especially ends one vaccine. Like world takes kills COVID next 5 years say, yeah, agree right. It'll big boogie man, ""rememeber gubment made yall take rona vaccine?!?! Mind Control!!!"" comes true, would Stephen King Superflu type situation, remains deadly, becomes even so. Details details details... Moderna one one masses much less stringent cold chain requirements needing much less centralized distribution network... LARGE hospitals freezers keep Pfizer one cold enough, much outside level care... season giving 😪 meant remember like ""kill arabs"" ""excercise basic medical precautions extended period time even though inconvenient"" dont carry around current shot records right now. makes think thats going change? Inpatient care medically complicated patients loss leader hospitals, especially patients good private insurance. Whatever might billed patients, hospital spending least much terms labor equipment costs. patients sought hospitals whatsoever, one reason frequently end either catchment hospitals tertiary care/quaternary care hospitals associated academic institutions. Hospital finances driven dependent facility fees procedures, period. Regional hospitals fail retain surgical volume eventually become fiscally insolvent either close sell larger network. ongoing process least last two decades medicine. 

To imply patients mechanically ventilated financial reasons New York ignorant dangerous. time, people intubated early due reports countries indicating rapid progression severe hypoxia, well due concern viral aerosolization less invasive modalities oxygen delivery including high flow nasal cannula CPAP/Bipap, significantly improve delivered O2 concentration vs simple nasal cannula even non-rebreather. since learned harmful mechanical ventilation patients, practices gone way trying minimize invasive positive pressure ventilation. Implying physicians intubating mechanically ventilating patients unnecessarily due profit motive (rather ignorance due novel nature COVID) pretty big claim frankly quite insulting ICU doctor, even though practice New York. Pfizer, BioNTech. Spanish Flu, American Flu. “TIL 2020 significant portion US population denied existence COVID-19.” Oh, I'm sure countries recognize average intelligence level fine. Downvoted whole +168 article title mean 95% effective 95% safe? safe 95% effective? That's countries try do. Even Russia agreements production AstraZeneca one Chinese vaccines, despite Sputnik V plus least two backup vaccines earlier stages testing. try problem first past post tabulation. choice generally guy sucks, least aligns number things vs guy align much all. issue emergent system itself. Yeah, federal government would foot bill.

Pithy phrases Econ 101 level understanding don’t mean much. see next year freedom both. one force anyone get vaccine US millions refuse get Pretty scary. 1% becomes 2%, 2% becomes 4%, etc. momentum takes bit get going quickly escalates, like ION engine. laugh, that's exactly kind shit they're hysterical about. vaccine ""mark beast"" means can't certain things like job, get theaters. Nice! Thanks sharing! might missing something, seems like article talking live vaccines think Covid vaccines getting tested likely approved imminently within grouping. spot something like place contact tracing low incidence community spread. another context would almost invisible. 

There could 4 outbreaks strain like US Brazil doubt would even notice ubiquitous entire multi state region least months.  thought exclude people vaccinated acces public places. 
For example, anyone vaccinated allowed enter government buildings(courthouse/libary/school etc) events.

That restriction make day day life close impossible injecting self brand new longterm tested vaccine. 
So, yea would really choice anymore Accomplished without warp speed funding I’m introverted person; 2 months pandemic sitting pretty, self isolation nice vacation uncomfortable social stuff normally grated exhausted me.

6 months though started getting weird, unprecedented cravings go hang crowded nightclubs, normally *hate* nightclubs. weird. Band aid top mask/your nose. There's completely safe way though. Along chain, someone's going go around high risk person symptomatic. pass someone will. It’s also family common cold coronaviruses. Dumb argument. add 100k+ excess deaths around half million deaths. Someone can’t named responsible American deaths lost WW2. freedom states rights covfefe chyna hoax. virus like foreign smart-car drives automated car factory, overwrites central blueprints own, tells central computer keep delivering orders machines make copies (which drive factories same). time employee monitors production comes around check robotic factories may late anything it.  
A traditional vaccine like delivering small pile foreign car's headlights factory, maybe bunch flashing lights signs saying ""look here!"" it. parts harmless sit there, employee comes around notices belong writes bunch programming protocols staff lookout headlights future never let car containing anywhere near business campus. 
This mRNA vaccine like delivering single one-time order machines make foreign headlights. end result same, certain benefits tricking machines make headlights producing sneaking whole pile business. I'll happy actually able get job kids school without worry getting everyone family deathly sick. Jet fuel tons additives make extremely toxic burn.

Here's best protect others need patient. There's light end tunnel seen since March come far sooner think us expected, even Spring/Summer 2021. Nope. dont want live woods stay house forever, want interact people dont right murder people degree University Facebook says otherwise. threw $5trillion wall street got 10 gorillion dollar air force bombers hell yes supply free vaccine  Personally plan get vaccinated soon can, feel there’s least little merit concerns.

I’m software developer, ship projects slowly carefully, time extended closed open betas, tonnes testing/QA, etc., lot less bugs/issues eventually ship project everyone. we’re huge time crunch, way shorter betas, less testing/QA, despite best efforts ship bugs/issues. think reasonably generalizable phenomenon almost project - rushed less safe, else equal.

With said, vaccines extremely safe general, we’ve produced LOTS past. isn’t something massively different produced past, slightly different - lowers risks/unknowns lot. even though it’s exceptionally short time start phase 1 trials widespread vaccination, little time long term side effects show ... likely won’t significant ones.

Basically, think vaccine bit riskier one developed tested 15 year period, hard see wouldn’t be. think risk vaccine likely still way lower risk COVID presents, sign up! give doctor bobbit call I’m not. That’s opinion things. you, may better. know vaccine safe long term unintended side effects? I'm way questioning legitimacy vaccine, general question medicine developed quickly. know body 10 years now? I've actually trying find answer hard sort articles give blanket ""it's safe"" statement. Considering stupid population acting right now, might benefit planet reproduce. would suggest could mean things, potentially. makes think long term immunity you’ve it. long term mean least eight months. otherwise would seeing much higher reinfection rates. Twenty 55 million basically zero.  better hope nobody ever invades florida

oh dear, really want go ? Florida seized, Spain, 1811, *very quietly* US troops. done, mostly, James Madison greatly concerned British landing Florida, taking possession, invading north. 1819, US Spain finally made legal. Otherwise, Florida might contested land. one micro-chip please!

Anyway. No, said mathematically impossible yet 99.8% survival rate.  here, specifically 7-11 refuses comply mask mandates, regardless post doors. month ago, went 8am, group bicyclists walked in, one wore mask, rest made fun 'considerate was'.

It's disgusting, even trying respectful, flat ignorance point. 


(many instances exact thing, 7-11 employees wearing masks, 7-11 employees wearing mask nose, 7-11 employees caring customers wearing mask all...) I'm convinced argument. He's right ""hyper-division powers"", time Belgium took stronger measures, country-wide, earlier Netherlands. country look less clueless neighbours either. Sounds good , effective vaccines? wait actual usage. says heart disease COVID. Jesus. Portion control, people. Vermont elect Bernie Sanders U.S. Senator Republican governor time. hell, Vermont? Fuck old fucks, right, cares! Personally know exactly completely eradicate it... think long close int'l airports, cannot eradicated...we still new active cases then, literally test everyone enters China international airlines tracing everyone who'd close contact travelled infected quarantining high risks, seems like effective methodology overall. seems contained things escalated. Well...

They even column ""Infected without symptoms"" daily data would China hole city would get tested see not. 

exactly. they're even small living groups test whole city one case. fun 3500 karma 😂 iWin Keep living soviet fantasy world, buddy. Hello. recently spent around hour half hanging around someone tested positive COVID-19 today. currently symptoms. precautions take now? Bruh hate encounter jackass oblivious fact tiny germ particle kill them. Trying explain COVID jackass task Bill Belicheck would struggle with. March? Lol. wish .  Try January. perspective:

The Israeli government already supply agreements Moderna, Arcturus, Pfizer indirectly AstraZeneca (through EU supply agreement).

Israel also developing vaccine, currently stage trial.

Bottom line: government trying cover bases. people work airlines like this. Let’s quarantine week goodness human kind. one telling us so. next Monday? clue seems realistic me, surely there’s way big majority US population going vaccinated then? Same. many people attacking Chinese indiscriminately dislike CCP. Yes! Also regime Iran finds identity anti-West. best policy (I think) bad relations, bad West threatens existence. keep slowly damaging Iran ordinary people suffer stupid political game.

God forbid nation broken up. can’t imagine would allow it. State work Order Doctors nurses. really obligated go work cannot strike.
It's strange Maybe stop looking tweets? mean yeah, practically kills frail old people. That's fact. actually believes it’ll six days? countries done really well Europe America look puzzlement even envy. think us lost opportunity summer virus easier beat. 

Has progress work find source virus China elsewhere? Wait, mean president Trump's message 'let states deal it' terrible idea? 


Wow, I'm surprised... Absolutely, hope districts able deliver like doing. Also, multiple pick sites question anyone says they're picking x number kids kids present. schools trying. Stupidity something can’t define, can’t give one example of. Interesting lack education really shape people’s political beliefs bonus. us didn’t get bonus . lot large hospitals won’t pay covid sick time either

Brave enough spend every dime order protect kids covid everyone else including president called crazy. Yeah interested going think...not are.

at least anyway.

i think article answers question...it give actual numbers need draw meaningful conclusions whether slowdown testing occuring.

other data sources give backwards looking shot days. This! problem rural areas people ran health system lot less intensive away Reddit, anyone Republican, conservative, seen literal blight society. Sounds much like message we've getting Canada (from feds provinces). see, conspicuous consumption (unexamined) internet 'opinions' images supposedly denote popularity hence tribal 'belonging' rather showing material goods ala Veblen's 'The Theory Leisure Class'. Yes, certainly exists. sorts corrupting influence least American politics lesser degree elsewhere. well called ""consumption"" even consumed material goods. Yep failed. quit. Isolating. Fuck y’all.

Either way, guys deserve more. problem becomes rest world. would two options then, force Covid response philosophy them, utterly close borders however long takes.

Do sit house day afraid? genuinely apocalyptic scary?

What thing really scaring this?

Is stats analysis kind mystery? certainly hard thing look at. Testing quality, cultural differentiations, multivariate factors pretty important. consider USA first world country comparable Luxembourg? ever India? really believe equal robust testing procedure do? Always gets someone lives actual spouse says they're going lonely holiday. Obviously never spent holiday alone. Ive sinusitis last month problem using surgical mask. I’ve read new vaccines target part virus, guess real question part shared among common forms coronavirus. might try duck bill shaped ones—they shouldn’t touch face except edges Yes. Like “shot” American term. seem understand America set up.

No one denying federal government pass law, original parent stated listen anything federal government unless ...

Which also true statement. States long history simply ignoring enforcing federal law. Look marijuana conundrum prime example. EU (as similar-ish legal structure) also issues. 

You correct, use extrapolate everyone else wrong, also correct. right. Well issue got lazy let guard down. Bars restaurants reopened, schools started going back person learning, people stopped wearing masks consistently before, etc.

And heavy tourism industry, also got inundated visitors surrounding states help either. 

And even large swaths CO ever really wearing masks consistently either...especially Springs south Weld county north I've said before, realities morbidities aside, pretty nice kind time. obvious reasons, kind reflects value work much differently.

We're working people, enjoy something, method work really grotesque. feel Covid highlighted sides, work doubled-down on.

Hope dust (and politics) settles case analysis brought light. Absence evidence infer evidence absence. Failing find evidence support existence something reason increase confidence actually exist. words, patently false claim. point wearing mask jogging park, nobody around me?

I’d like believe however deaths exclusively US. It’s hard believe one cartridge made anywhere else world. Stands reason. would really interesting data. Pretty well controlled experiment. world focusing shorter shorter terms awhile now. Investors used okay % growth year. Now, demand unrealistic gains. Plus there's short-termisim elected leaders focusing election cycles instead actual policies. people's attention spans reduced dramatically since TV invented interwebs... etc etc. Meanwhile, you, individual, expected forward looking save money retirement never squander everything else carries present. sucks. life. rethink meetings events major facets don’t work virtually. Worth noting half reason happening particular outbreak seems caused new strain virus incubation period 1 2 days - hell lot quicker 10-14 days we're used to. Although symptoms apparently quite mild far, there's every chance could spiral control form another immediately stopped. Lol nice comeback. 99% Americans eating fucking Thanksgiving liberals conservatives. Stay fuck home cry it. Idiots. People would expect get reference dogs aren’t actually allowed restaurants. 

So someone mentions dog goes dates Italian restaurant, they’re probably referring incredibly famous movie dog goes date Italian restaurant. 

Because that’s thing actually happens real life. 

Because dogs aren’t allowed restaurants. 

*ProTip: someone mentions seen White House blown alien spacecraft, they’re also referring something happened movie.* go outside. Leave everyone else gym alone. really DONT care DONT care. get out. title match [the Masks required everywhere outside home except in: scenarios makes sense need. that’s listen experts probably fire entire pandemic response team kanye Interesting. stand corrected. Thanks. friend high risk individual wondering stacking vaccines would give higher efficacy. sorry family. agree, Andy absolutely nailed look opposition faces. shudder terror think Bevin would done/not done. 373 hospitalized today released (either go home, mortal coil). factor dead recovered numbers see many hospitalized today. law firm works insurance companies large corporations, billing 1/10 hour increments. quickly recognized Zoom cool novelty, hugely inefficient way communicate 2020. 

Give team break, increase efficiency, let get 'core competencies' MBAs used say. fully support expanding vaccine requirement laws.  someone wears mask someone else makes her. wearing mask want safe, wear someone else required (halfheartedly often begrudgingly) following rules. 

You always tell people like always wait last second put mask sometimes already building often take soon longer matters get trouble. 

They second worst 4 groups people pandemic. That’s ridiculous argument. equated pandemic order clearly infringing first amendment clearly would controversial. saying states enforcing coronavirus rules social distancing infringing rights people? war would want states able sit commit citizens resources? war, virus. Wearing masks, social distancing, closing non essential businesses asking people stay home shouldn’t controversial pandemic. federal government help protect small businesses coordinate large scale response. 

Imagine disease much worse mortality rate much higher? Would ok states acting like it’s ok? Ridiculous notion. Oof Fauci tryna get fired something? Sheesh, can’t believe ask question. 5.8 million people dude two polarized sides credible evidence

Doubtful long term side effects vaccines, safe inject. understand reason many vaccines fail long term effects, good immunization rates.

I immunologist, vaccines very, safe long term. 😂 make sense given gun culture certainly not, think actually touched higher that, 34%

Correct I'm wrong.

It's literally part DHS, redundant freedom-killing government sector made ""small gubment lover"" GWB. Hmm...

Now, ICE specific camps? know started, [concentration camps immigrants never ended United (it also debatable US penal system large concentration camp well, since fits criteria one.)

Did Obama start openness reporting ICE detention camps? Probably. People mistakenly believe ""bombed shit places"" GWB, truth yeah, loads bombings happened Obama, knew ones *did*. GWB's regime accountability.

Learn rabbits hole are, like one obviously since believe ""antifa"" scary organization instead commonly held belief? I'm saying, immunologist worked biotech years, go slower imagining. hang ups. 

Remember Oxford talking vaccine readout September they've pushed December? deal. takes distribution snag, Trump firing everyone charge leave mess Biden, safety concern go 10s thousands 10s millions dosed (very common), slower vaccine uptake expected (understandable given much safety rhetoric vaccine), etc...

Just trying set realistic expectations.  Ride bike one bc keeps air warm. Let's face America lasted long thru sheer hardworking frontline workers idea stop COVID rather give time understand widespread outbreak is. Essentially shutting us 6 days give contact tracers chance get snapshot situation now.  think it’s 100x likely someone denies COVID still thinks Muslims responsible 9/11 definitely gets mad ask select language ATMs. countries tried useless shit too. actually worked anywhere? I'm seriously curious. Yes.

People morons world over.

We Australia immune insidious disease.

This panic buying likely see 6 days turn two full weeks harshest lockdown conditions seen yet, followed by, SA lucky, 4 weeks harsh restrictions.

I’d STILL rather Adelaide right anywhere USA, simply Australian governments have, continuing to, take COVID seriously. official numbers. actual numbers higher Taking samples, handling samples, setting test, getting reliable result trivial. done labs reason. increase false results would make practically useless. Exactly. overworked single parent nurse three kids worked 10th 12 hour shift row, 2 consecutive days since June, told even covid, come work long symptoms mild moderate.


Let damn mcdouble dude is.

Some people grow past (I did) getting stuck someone like lockdown would really hard.  Protests nothing, unless get massive like recent human rights protests police. Even then, politicians worked hard make superficial changes really change anything.

So got economy full operation customers, shuts own.

And back square one, except thousands tens thousands died get there. if, when. Yes that’s true even worse considering tangential jobs well (think tourism attraction based roles businesses getting money travelers).

Longer term economy workforce adapt forces probably inevitable anyway time table much shorter. Unfortunately looks likely short term painful unemployed / employed result.

But we’re getting public consent &amp; buy-in voluntary, cooperative measures protect one another (Christ, even struggle get people wear masks), draconian enforcement lockdowns may needed keep hospitals reaching capacity. Either way, don’t envy governors make tough decision. Oh saying people suck. agree. pulling out-of-staters going beach memorial day / July 4, warning them, probably giving tickets. Giving hugs you!

Covid kill high percentage, takes long time allows high transmission rates, kill far people Ebola.

Fresno mask policy, enforcing it, Tulare county not, refuses to. 


Guess county exploding CoV cases? wont hearing FDA approving vaccine atleast 10th december. Hi I'm virus, keep youre Yum Maybe not. Testing much pervasive earlier days. higher proportion cases might getting caught.

Some math supports idea.

Wisconsin 334,640 total cases 2,776 deaths yesterday. CFR therefore 0.83%.

It's thought COVID true CFR 0.6%. true, would imply 40% cases missed, since 0.83% 40% greater  0.6%.  seem forgotten everything since started.. everything knew became obsolete one new coronavirus introduced...

/sigh Buses poor people Hmm, automod needs tuneup desperately. Literally posted New England,... ya know what, worth this. Bad bot. Optimistically general public ***start*** getting vaccinated around April next year probably going take get enough people vaccinated ditch masks. Joe Biden plan take action actually *implement* plan help way need stay strong hold now.

Keep washing hands, vigorously full 20 seconds.

Keep wearing mask -over mouth ***and*** nose- whenever public.

Keep social distancing isolating best practical.

This clearly goal. breakfast dinner. Hash browns, sausages beans...

That's actually rare imagine days.

As eating, crowd easy thing do. Order food go, take food terminal, find place people sitting, that's pretty easy right now. two sit enjoy meal without mask worry people next restaurant. [Rugby game. turns 52,000 people. I'm scared... Even though say they're safe. Adelaide New Zealand new cases nowhere... people actually worried Covid vaccine cause adult onset autism? That's kinda wild. Right fights left. 
Left fights right. 
That issue. Everything governors, whether R D, make things political. Could explained rise covid cases rural areas? Lucira’s website says device cost less $50, FDA article says it’s going prescription, health insurance may pay least cost. Unusual GOP governor decent human being, two things seem mutually exclusive except VT. made bed shall lie it. Lol weird timelime, William Barr president United States. small blessing virus control. There's 10 vaccines phase 3, likely US based ones get enough data pretty soon. sub group base still think hoax used travel lot software consultant. helped site could get better feel human issues nobody puts writing. could learn much week sitting users hearing stories watching workdays - go home spend couple days putting plan together cool shit could build string together fix problems. 

I stopped traveling kids, I’m consultant anymore. work fully remotely former customer across country visit person every couple years. So, I’m quite used working remotely. still trying ingest much information multiple new customers could, nothing would substitute on-site time. much happens office isn’t communicated well email telephone. 

Lots nonverbal physical stuff gets communicated person miss remotely. get things done anyway, it’s quite good. mean... unironically yes first half? **That** part I'd take issue with.  makes laugh certain party big personal responsibility also typically party wants deny seriousness covid mask wearing. Almost like care personal responsibility it’s convenient them. What’s problem skeptical negative effects lockdown? legitimate drawbacks going leave long term problems society decades come think wrong. Coronavirus also handled state Australia live. states Western Australia better others taking extraordinary measures effectively shuting world, also rest country states fortunate, nevertheless mostly prevailed.

I think state-by-state apporach US ""disjointed"", America's response outbreak overall ""disfunctional"" ""too little late"". Fuck Dan Patrick Didn’t say March ? God love much!!!! I'm going party hard defeat virus! 0.068% 35-45 age group. 

0.004% 35 age group. GOP response Biden getting serious covid going sabotage every possible attempt. GOP can't lead Democrats effective makes look bad they'd rather another 250k Americans dead.  Idk least don’t rona like idiot lmao  First time DUI crime Wisconsin. citation, like speeding ticket. Intelligent people understand impose kinds restrictions *before* gets control. *you* understand that? Don’t racist comments make elsewhere? I’m really confused take home Covid test 3 months ago... decent fucking human governor, say COVID deniers need stop making worse even republican governor like Phil Scott Vermont. CFR significantly overestimates risk dying infection, doesn’t count cases aren’t formally diagnosed (which overwhelming majority COVID infections). 

The appropriate metric IFR, 35-45 age group 0.068% (about 7 deaths 10,000 infections). 

By way comparison, 35-45 year old US, annual risk dying auto collision similar accident 0.055%. 

For 35 age group IFR 0.004% (4 deaths 100,000 infections). South dakota leaders 20 years behind times, they'll snowflake Christmas this. This^^^ Medical professional here. done much. kinda worthless worried political future done earlier pst point weak ass measures. need full shutdown isolation visitors. people even know children? mean, they're germy even we're pandemic. never bought ""kids can't spread it"" thing. darn cheap expand bus service. rail lines astonishingly expensive get land use construct. actually safer think. Planes pretty kick-ass filtration.

If want read up: Interesting take. agree SCOTUS confirmation thing. McConnell caught lot flak ramming nomination even though personally said years ago. agree needed happen, yeah, think procedures around probably good thing. Idk ending filibuster though- think hurts sides. designed slow government mean, sides getting increasingly radical- bad idea start disassembling brake lines car rolling downhill. prob! sucks can't trust anyone reddit  canada Ah. buy that. However, think reason people making big deal talk guy - convincing sign document severe fact police came talk first place. China best track record transparency (mostly due internet censorship, think) really easy rumors spread - may true, false, know lid kept info. God watched interview.

No shame.

Sterilize breed morons! alcohol food racked even come hour two overtime get salary. Businesses mind communism coming right up! I've used virtually every OS ever released since 1980s. Windows far unstable except maybe BSD 4.2 Unix (4.3 fixed recall). makes sad. hope virus okay. Whenever Trump apologist Covid downplayer babbles bullshit, often use Alaska example. Even one least populated extremely isolated states, response containment far worse entire countries populations 5, 10, 20× many people. enough businesses shift primarily work home, could actually see convention/hotel event business growing. worked mostly remote company met least quarter company event. location rotated major event friendly cities.

Sorry that. 

It’s great people making things worse are. gives deniers ammo pretend it’s big deal incites panic. Texas yet medical capacity crisis. may get there, current numbers considering heading holidays... it’s pretty scary.

You well! Good luck that. guess next step PA government install cctv inside people’s homes... 'state-by-state' approach Federalism dictates per US Constitution

If want lockdown halt interested migration, call governor job. No, I’m convinced basically circle jerk Republicans supporting him....they jerk little less day.. He's president US leader republikkkan party, mean actually anything? lol savings vote republican... 

Have considered fact anti union, pro big business policies favor socioeconomic position? control, would announcing restrictions.  lot optimism mRNA vaccines covid hit, seems like proving case. Certainly applications do, lot development around potential 'cancer vaccines' using mRNA. Time tell, good reason optimistic. 

Afaik, challenge getting mRNA vaccine cells without prompting immune response nix could job creating relevant proteins. Fundamentally, quicker development low cost produce versus traditional methods. get roms Ashley read Covinthians19.

Real telling Nvm Governors close borders. China done something wrong, government later admitted mistreated Dr. Li.

Fauci setting groundwork implementation Pandemic Playbook (no lockdowns version).

Trump's political interference [set aside previous attempt Dr Fauci implement US Pandemic wtf going dakotas Wisconsin? holy crap, thanks clearing remotely expert. Bachelors degree Science (medical &amp; health physics) many moons ago bunch reading -- want lead astray expertise. 

Getting mRNA Vaccine cell without prompting immune response one main challenges getting whole thing working. said, mechanism mRNA vaccine get cells, produce protein cell spike able leave cell. prompts immune response. 

The 'spike' protein never incorporate cell barrier. Think lock &amp; key -- normally virus spike key cell wall lock receptor opens allow virus enter infect cell. First, design protein becomes embedded cell type application. Second, would presumably occur outset would appear early clinical trials. Neither mRNA protein creates persist body, change DNA this. mRNA particularly stable molecule [typically lasts several minutes unlike DNA much robust sorts repair mechanisms make last lifetime cell. Likewise, proteins last indefinitely mRNA working created.

And also answer second question. mRNA typically self replicating (although believe engineered so, something occurs accidentally). Virus self replicating implants nucleus cell either type viral RNA used make mRNA direct cell make virus copies, implants DNA cell (a retrovirus, e.g., HIV) make mRNA. understanding work 'self-amplifying' mRNA vaccines dependent type DNA (plasmid DNA), vaccines are.

The Pixel test require one, turnaround time generally couple days. definitely needs faster option. time bury grandma Christmas! Well vaccine first gets distributed much. Healthcare workers vulnerable get first, healthcare workers getting covid much lower rate general population, really put dent hospital numbers. vaccine help bit 25 million doses go far. Distribution, storing ultra low temperature. little trickier get vaccine already. It’s like safety net burger flippers. Laying deal unemployment system better option. 

Millions restaurant industry workers job indefinitely many businesses shutting good. workers keep roof heads too. That's he's last 4 years. whining Twitter throwing tantrums. Even wear mask follow guidelines? Except per today's press conference. Yup know virus abides it’s bedtime South Australia breach quarantine, 22 cases. state locking quickly six days. try get top contact tracing stop spread. People like shut businesses, etc stay home, wearing masks go side limited number reasons. one wants end like U S.

I'm Canadian, Federal Government important provincial civic governments, always taught opposite US. That’s smart. coronavirus nocturnal virus order helpful. Actually, ""small blessing"". Completing Phase 3 trial literally required virus completely control, least one country. everyone ""right thing"", trial would've failed. Well, yeah. wonder COVID earlier COVID sympathy ploy. I'm sure really help noon Buckeyes game Saturday /s meth, covid? Huh. Go figure. mean course, never said good enough reason attend thanksgiving year. Ready move Vermont! Who’s hiring?? Governor Hogan Maryland said something similar today: ""This political issue. limitation right infect people."" people...

A five word summarization America.  vegan then? Sure absolutely. politicians need held accountable actions finances. Purely greedy POV though, money vote party advocate things like unemployment covid stimulus?

Like think minute. guy saw Mitch McConnell refuse even vote money daughter voted party. That's insane. Oh see, I’ve reading tons confused, thinking positive point tested negative. 

Oh yes, false negatives fairly common person tested viral count still low, like beginning infection. Otherwise I’m sure. Basically it’s hard tell virus infectious yet mild that’s it’s spreading easily. Safest thing none see close quarters. That’s basically comes to. Well definitely wouldn’t running deaths world COVID could even potentially much lower towards first world countries.

With coordinated engaged effort, yes, believe would sense normalcy now.

The vaccine situation changed immunity SARS-COV-2 uncertain. later found vaccine might completely mitigate problem, least beginning. Like said though, wasn’t expected get bad one expected nation essentially nothing mitigate it.

A lot questions many others getting irritated questions simply cannot answered 100% certainty. Spoken like true dude, bro. Damn Randy Marsh Mickey Mouse sex bat Pangolin China. South Park showed truth. Hello fellow participant. sure got vaccine. got sore arm 2 days hopefully. hoping would unblind study could know sure. Oh well. someone outside Georgia, help get Mitch McConnell power support democratic candidates? state voted blue across ballot enough create lasting federal change possible, doubt it. Near tell, truly sees careful. unlike many teachers building, one ones lowers mask talk meetings constantly flaps front face trying pump virus lungs. 

I think lot people used following rules. mask-wearing optional building, I'm pretty sure handful teachers would wearing them. Regarding mentioned kids, remember telling sheepishly HS son would meet GF WalMart summer, stay-at-home order place. many insurance policies exclude ""communicable diseases."" collectable insurance, much less likely viable lawsuit. also wrong. Congratulations wrong right. urban cities overflowing homeless crackheads reading article, incredibly selfish irresponsible. Difficult times require difficult choices. going complain everyone starts living lives happily lol Heck, they're even finding Victorian wastewater anymore.

Just providing source backup said claim: think it’s hard make something many cases countries early differences testing capacity gets tested. looking deaths would suggest Sweden bigger spread initially others. Looking 1st April strategy would effect yet numbers were:

Sweden 343

Denmark 90

Norway 28

Finland 17 Oh clear garbage American education system makes Americans think they're literally federation earth. Hate see it. funding bunch nominally useless stuff even open. (certain arts programs, appreciate art indeed important, fund something completely closed needs minimal funding stay afloat, instead hundreds millions ear marked). literal tacking stuff bloat 2-3 times needs fund people's needs.

i'm helping keep things running smoothly, means. need wrap shenanigans really there? team red came table proposals pretty much seemed like needed (funding worker relief programs that's mostly it) team blue tries shovelware random crap in. like, what? 1.8billion vs 4+ billion. where's 2.2+ billion going to, really? oh, wait. big corp stuff like arts program mentioned. say nothing number times pelosi refused show plans handing over, crap bloat.

i'm sitting center shaking head absurdity. Several states positivity rates 40%. 

Which means testing woefully inadequate even getting *close* true number infected. think it’s interesting question. It’s probably constitutional exercise congress’s power regulate interstate commerce, days everything plausibly touches interstate commerce. might majority Supreme Court wants pull back federal Commerce Clause power, effectively unlimited decades. extremely rare get covid twice? confirmed cases happening low enough labelled extreme outliers Exactly this. something happens someone they’ve Covid, doesn’t mean is/was caused Covid. cording Fauci, need faster progress.

My prediction: we'll top 100k quickly return low hospitalisations states. places much community spread poor access testing nobody ever really sure got it, got it, even it.

A lot people bending backwards come explanation/justification exposure schools. lot (sociopathic) parents testing sick children want quarantine, want school shut down. worst lot even keeping home, sending even know infected.

There little testing children, unless adult house tests positive (especially symptomatic), believe absolutely skews numbers.

Everyone knows bacterial viral infections spread like wildfire though schools: colds, flu, conjunctivitis, parasites, STIs (in older students), etc. get rational person thinks COVID different.

Students infecting other, students infecting teachers, students infecting parents, teachers infecting partners/housemates children--and vice-versa every account.

Over 1 million diagnosed, many viral loads equal adult infected people even less symptoms (and like adults, develop severe lethal complications, don't.) sneeze, touch everything, take masks off, eat use toilet. parents, teachers, peers going exposed that. nobody understand Seinfeld reference? Jesus christ country become uptight. think America particularly bad flu season last year. ""However, according Deepta Bhattacharya, immunologist University Arizona, emerging evidence reinfections common cold coronaviruses “result viral genetic variations”, may relevant Sars-CoV-2."" basis make claim?

I live Adelaide, pursued elimination strategy back March, worked *perfectly*, I've lived life like normal 8 months week. back-to-back periods 100+ day periods 0 local transmission, even outbreak still single case unknown origin since March. fantastic here.

Sorry... there's smoke there's fire. state second highest rt rate country. We've added 1000 new cases 23 days.

Next. They'd listen single helpful idea. let adults talking.  I'm actually wife one, provided family tested positive actual swab, ""oh husband tested positive sore throat must too"" - intra-family transmission rates low, 10%-50% depending research read. 

And invited people you, guests expose you. 

But, test positive, unlikely infectious. Re-infection risks around 0.01% according Qatar study, likelihood still shed active virus longer 11 days low, unless severely immunocompromised, even virus body, body essentially surface risk surface low, see ""The estimated risk infection touching contaminated surface low (less 5 10,000), suggesting fomites play minimal role SARS-CoV-2 community transmission."" get amount, US would average 2,000 deaths day end January. even IHME predicting anything close that.

Poland under-reporting deaths 70-75% 603 reported deaths could easily mean 2000+ deaths reality. Trinity relatively new.

Unlike Sicktoria. friend 800 people invited nov 28th. hall cancelled her. moving parents shed “working guest list”. It’s highest affected county Ohio. vaccines pretty limited effect population level initially. Sure, great get early, make big effect pread ave fairly large fraction vaccinated. question whether done fall (cold season) 2021 not. I'm optimistic can, seems come many vaccines approved soon.

Optimistically we'll 2 3 approved jan/feb emergency use even earlier that. least gives small chance second half 2021 begin normal.

Hoping vaccines widely available outside risk groups Q1 2021, sure way disappointed. first wave Belgium 7% got infected till June. even close herd immunity even assume reinfections.

The entire body scientific evidence mask usage pandemic basically totally disregarded, new studies finding mask use useless covid muted politically. 

There sort cult around mask use frightening watch, people aren’t free point without getting attacked subreddits like this, real problem going forward. 

The truth science says something different general public wearing masks people want admit. gets really dangerous every medical scientific association world knew beginning year course always advised mask use general public science says. 

And people sort brainwashed believe science says masks work believe scientific community sort conspiracy masks beginning pandemic.

It’s financial hit us, completely worth it. He’s thriving.  Pfizer raises 97%. Well, Pfizer released preliminary results, probably rounded 94.5% full 10% - gives 90%. Moderna rounded first digit comma - 94.5%. Pfizer decided round last digit comma - coming 95%.

I think that's maximum get rounding vaccine 94.5 94.5499% effective... Imagine would respond ISIS Iran killing 1000-1500 American citizens day. 

Imagine could stop 90% wearing small piece cloth face time. Well tested vaccine trials wonder thought going happen. healthcare worker, I'm incredibly excited wife (also healthcare) may get vaccinated next couple months. load off, especially since runs Covid clinic moment. gets times deniers act like never drive car accidents kill people. Maybe logic sounded good 6 months ago, Covid-19 3rd leading cause death U.S.


Or the, ""if worried kids getting Covid-19 school, maybe close prevent getting hurt accidents commuting school."" argument.



It's almost like get there's tons things prevent accidents injuries deaths. Plenty federal, state, local regulations vehicle safety, local school zones. Fines penalties breaking rules. Standards vehicle manufacturers follow.

I'm tired this.

Yesterday hit last month, US' chief executive met COVID task force... since election, pandemic worse ever before. Trump mentioned nothing election.

For next 63 days, United States lift finger slow spread COVID 19, president aid incoming administration so.  Biden's team even assisted vaccine distribution.

This Trump's final, petulant ""fuck you"" American people... dereliction duty see 100,000 Americans die January 20, he's finally gone. Appreciated. can't bomb covid steal resources no. people pay it? meant be, trailing that. 150.000 people died yesterday. deaths matter? 2015 around 55 million people died. deaths matter? change behaviour way deaths? change behaviour death, choose disregard them? They’re claiming 95% actually finished Phase 3 trial! 170 infections primary endpoint, isn’t preliminary look anymore, outlined ending looking effectiveness. &lt;kisses gently disagree large percentage republicans seem vote best interest. Mitch evil, Devin idiot, gym Jones covers molesters, lindsey ass kisser, pearl necklace clutchers....? guess long ""they hate others much do"" important food table. I'm taking anything tested long term effects.

Well seem worried getting covid, also tested long term effects. -Within month rollout, someone fall ill. Either 1 million adverse reaction, unlucky coincidence (people fall ill time), unlucky still got Covid

-news sites report nothing else days, coupled headlines like ""experts cast doubt safety "" etc

-Vaccine scepticism amongst normal people grow, despite wrong

- vaccine rollout massively hindered That's actually neat info. Thanks sharing.

However, dogs I'm sure became infected, would fur alternate us want attention roommate literally done nothing isolate herself, staying home work.

She works retail, four days waiting results, continued working. I'm livid never informed employer undergoing test covid. Sure enforce federal law CDC got power state 10th amendment 1 1000 even highest rate US. goes new Jersey roughly 1 530 dead, mostly first wave. change behavior result believing treatment group? would almost go way pay flu vaccine US.

Every health insurance I've ever covered flu shots cost, Medicare flu shot covered cost, many big chain drug stores give flu shot high risk individuals low income people free.

The way could see actually paying flu shot go random doctor's office request it, zero health insurance filing Medicare. they’ll never know won’t care. Doctors zero say hospital policy. sign papers comply policy. situation described all. vaccine recipients Smee, Maimen, Doctuer, Pavel'ere Juan O'you Bro want anime conventions back 😔 Unfortunately one developed outside Trump's vaccine nationalist program? Perhaps 4 employees already virus asymptotically never going catch regardless mask wearing practices.  Question I’m curious study design standpoint: change behavior knowing likely treatment group? Ok, much bag Pfizer gonna make this? Tons countries probably going want buy vaccine wait truly mean 95% efficacy then? vaccinated people wearing masks taking precautions afterwards? always thought they’d expose vaccinated people virus, efficacy would determined. it’s 95% still follow precautions then? Sorry trying understand. I’m still going get vaccine, know missing something. Sorry, wasn’t implying didn’t know, wouldn’t disregard sort cost concern end user, despite whether Pfizer took money warp speed?

The debate going whether we’d charged comment taking money warp speed seemed indicate end users may end paying counter cost.

Maybe misunderstood saying. perfectly valid concern, there's lot misinformation kicking around it. interest discussing well, personally lot digging FDA archives, international medical journals, etc. subject.

I've unable find actual examples happening _vaccine_ since started proper clinical trials back 60's 70's (prior hard even find good documentation, wild west medicine). Post-release monitoring side effects place whole time. makes kind impossible give ""odds"" long-term side effects, happen world first something like 500+ different cleared vaccines.

There one case hear referenced lot; european H1N1 flu vaccine + adjuvant (chemical make effective) 2009. caused slight increase side effects including 0.03% chance causing narcolepsy. vaccine used without adjuvant elsewhere unusual side effects. follow-up studies pin increased side effects additional chemical rather vaccine itself.

It's also happened times non-vaccine medications like thalidomide. tend operate entirely different principles—introducing new chemicals modify body's function, vs priming innate immune system. Hell, population Dakotas combined 1.6 million. Well, yeah guess could see concerts, theme parks, mad gathering places, expect retail stores. nah watch social dilemma netflix you’ll see easy influence group social media.

sure part might stupidity, think type outside group influence wave anti-vaxx rhetoric. dont need hit 90% population vaccinated return normal, doubt we'llever hit many. 

With 90+% effective vaccine we'll need way less considering 10% country likely already contracted virus. know, herd immunity isnt nothing ordeal, vaccinate people R0 value continue drop reach point tolerable open everything strain healthcare systems. Summer 2021 bet. Media running fear write best do. LOL - reddit expert strikes again. Obviously know better people trained worked entire lives understand stuff.

Choosing take vaccine ""knowledge"" causes harm rest community. give consideration that. classmate come school visibly sick (that winter 2019/20) much could even smell sickness. Idk describe it, like badly hit common cold smell thing air room. could smell him. Apart visibly glassy eyes constant coughing/sneezing.

You bet multiple people class (me included) sick within week.

Like ffs stay home, make tea order food sick, matter is. calendars meant pedantic. They’re designed allow us specific. It’s entire purpose. I’ve never seen anyone use way. I’ve never said Xmas almost January. someone’s birthday almost June. going vacation it’s almost may, instead saying April. Back conspiracy sub China flu legit one. flipped.

What hairstyles this? Exactly. That's many Asian countries. courtesy culturally ingrained show symptoms without wearing mask, get pretty nasty judgement. Devastating new album “VAXXX” featuring brutal single “Coronanation” happened anti-vaxx rhetoric reached somehow, word word anti-vaxx facebook group would say.

lol literally said looking info, ""ammo"", dispel points Suppose house 10 people 10 rooms. One random person house STD.

Each time someone outside room sex whoever else outside room well.

What think happens think best idea control spread sickness gets sorted out?

Would best idea keep sex decision, potentially giving STD others need go out, staying put, limiting room outings STD gets sorted out? forget BioNTech That's infinite growth dumbass. Infinite growth reliant one resource stagnant environment. That's called marxism. again? I've already middle school ""4 10 N.J. residents say they're happy pandemic continuing exactly going right now"" 


&amp;#x200B;

... or, least, that's got article. Somewhere Moderna thread guy working field said usually people developing vaccine round full 10, especially final ""efficiency"" result Moderna kinda broke convention.

I looking comment, kinda hidden comment chain, can't find it. RNA actually going incorporated DNA way virus does. Rather, RNA degrades inside cells, happen it’ll get delivered body’s protein factory thingies (ribosomes), make spike protein, break down. put mask on, reduce transmission. 

Let rephrase that: put mask *everything else equal* (most likely) reduce transmission.

This testable lab though. It’s also interesting spread population. 

The reason make population level tests everything *isn’t* equal. put mask on, everyone around stand 10% closer average? mask suddenly positive negative effect. win? None thousands trial participants went feast delicious think-meats living. we're okay zombocalpyses. helps healthcare worker healthcare worker's families walked out. 

Maybe people / government taken seriously got here. successful marriage also requires partners healthy social lives own. stay locked person every day tensions might arise, even best marriages. Especially space small apartment work own. Yeah pretty much, especially since biden called trump way back october 2019 prepared pandemic. Biden knows he's doing. qualifying Moderna temp, review info Moderna significantly less strict storage requirements. way easier manage logistically.  spit hot fire  started reading Zombie Fallout series feels like genuine (not literally) concern. I'm obviously still going get it... maybe week two availability. question would afraid benign reaction.

...... literally answered that, answer obviously feel benign normal person might them. That's fear want quelled. kinda ignored it. Small pox vaccine around level effectiveness small pox eradicated earth.  So, chance made mandatory States? feel like stupid people Pandemic, we'll whole lot folks unwilling get vaccine regardless anti-vax otherwise. wife get year dead.

Cheers guess. subreddit always *incredibly* pessimistic. no. fucking. shit.

Fauci made huge concessions braindead country keep message goals achievable stay position good. It’s fucking amazing get bad say even basic commom sense shit. antibodies gone 3 months, mean it’s effective 3 months? stay vaccinated something without antibodies remaining system?  American pharmaceutical company comes days competitor vaccine 5% accurate approved corrupt US government slogan America first.

No thanks think people already forgot exponential growth works. situation getting hand. sad part people dying virus thinking real. 230,000 deaths still hoax. /smh Disgusting evil. Apparently moms CDC decision making board. parent child kind daycare/school 8 years age could tell places petrie dishes. Careful ruffle jimmies sub radical take. ""Thoughts prayers"" 5% won’t herd immunity effective? I'm sorry, what? someone lives with/dates nurse works primarily immuno-comprimised children (Pediatric ICU), could excited able get vaccine. may still worry myself, least peace mind her. Try millions. I'm healthy 27 year old work home I'll last line get vaccinated.

Really high risk population getting vaccinated care though. immunity there's reason can't go back normal life. Tests supposed free even without insurance. example Labcorp's free without insurance 45 states (and DC) grant religious exemptions vaccines public schools. Every single year several ads go people push everyone get flu vaccine....to protect everyone. understand yet? Concert venues already started working verification system. Insurance companies could charge unvaccinated employees. thing makes hopeful much money stake get things opened again. companies thriving due nature business, lot people losing lot money. technology appreciate linking this, thank much! Would vaccine mean could ditch PPE wear? mom boat. RN specializes extremely fragile children youth hospice. imagine careful order kill small cohort extremely fragile children provides care for. long till becomes #1 cause death? kinda identified worse.

Lets say need 50 people certain demo say something safe. follow population lines perfectly, might end 50 people even representation.

Now, Im sure would differences, worry many times medical studies refer basically white males.

Like iirc car safety basically tests men. experience Big Mac. that's takes avoid COVID-meth-gators, I'm OK that. thinking wearing mask even vaccinated.

I liked going whole year without single cold flue illness kind. getting sick 4-5 times per year whole life? Avoiding pretty sweet. fuck anyone ever sneezed least feel guilty covering mouth *biontech vaccine Definitely school. Hindsight 20/20, wish school summer infection rate low. Uh, that’s million children tested positive SINCE PANDEMIC STARTED. would imagine numbers since school started likely either line average positivity rate country, likely lower since children haven’t giant superspreaders everybody made be. 

Also places schools really well. Generally seems follow whatever states better others don’t schools problem/opted full virtual. Stop paying tests. get test free even without insurance places like Good luck then. wife get infected year kicking getting vaccine. decide get vaccinated please tell nurse put veins. applied muscle tissue veins. LOL. note anyone holding taking 2021, too: whatever far wearing PPE, social distancing, quarantining must done get vax. I'm getting two shots soon available me, sending masks back hell belong.

That's problem. scientists (Fauci included) saying masks social distancing still required even people start getting shots. going ignore advice? lol... intuition says change kind sloppy/cheap protocol tries shuck liability onto staff.  Sound right?

But btw, thank much service this. guys pretty fucking awesome.  friends work NYC hospitals back March/April sounded like war zone anything ever saw army.  trucking boxes p100 respirators local construction companies surgical masks. Reminded old Rumsfeld line ""you go war army have, army want"" ragtop hummvees soft body armor.

I'm really sorry best brightest join ranks people found 1/2 country government give flying fuck lives uses meat grinder. Hopefully least somewhat balanced fact people really awe efforts, eager punish people derelict duties.  :-/ think majority country holds opinion virus fake. may majority Trump contingent, voters represent 20% America guarantee believe that. good point. Kamala Harris favors sowing doubt ""rushed"" vaccine political points. voted Biden, happy that, emboldens software anti-vaxxers, talk Already started happening.

My wife critical care / ICU nurse thankfully moved work home nurse case management job. know large number nurses already quit, planning quitting soon. due concerns family member's health, due working conditions mental/physical fatigue.  

Which brings us next issue. see wife's email box. number emails gets nurse staffing agencies offering truly insane pay (as 8-10k week + meals lodging) contract ICU nursing positions staggering. Hospitals critically short staffed, large number nurses remaining job, leaving full time salaried positions pursuing highly lucrative contract jobs; many leaving employee Friday walking back ICU contractor Monday 8-10x pay. blame all, many healthcare systems (especially smaller / rural) cannot afford pay every nurse staff 30-40k month. 

Some people think get better healthcare workers vaccinated, won't. Something people talking vaccines work. ***prevent*** person contracting COVID-19, simply give person's body rapid immune response virus; meaning people asymptomatic and/or minor symptoms; infection resolve much faster. 

This key point: person infected, 100% asymptomatic spread virus others (even 7-10 day incubation period), vaccinated person still spread COVID-19 non-vaccinated persons. simply vaccinating healthcare workers **NOT** eliminate risk healthcare worker's families. article think read yesterday said 25/28 pharmaceutical companies done this.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* got side effects shot test positive antibodies. put anti vaxxers one pool, please realize people get CERTAIN vaccines good reason. Myself, example, get flu vaccine induce seizures epileptics. understanding chances slim, there's hesitation part I'd rather get flu seizure. Even taking consideration could spread flu, I'd still rather risk brain damage broken back whatever else. 

I'm likely going get vaccine ASAP, even knowing vetted quite much maybe should, wanted give food thought. would thought we'd looking forward get stabbed 2020 see spoils anything. I'm still responding weekly data collection Pfizer asks living life would've I'd gotten it. (Wearing mask, social distancing possible going indoor dining, etc.) Yesterday 1 death every minute. Look world told great anymore. got source % claim. [worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/us](http://worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/us)/ closed cases 254,315 people died 7,089,862 recovered. 3% mortality rate far thought went away election ;) fair student gets go school get instruction face face, socialize students, play outside, etc etc student B one got vaccine didn't. 

You can't deny better education person ru deny right family vaccinated unconstitutional. choice get vaccination. 

Source: teacher likes studying/teaching law cases. 

A conservative SC would probably say otherwise. final analysis? Pfizer independent scientists? true, credible source found 50% cases chronic issues 6 months? true seen anything close that. argument able pass law anything.

Being allowed drink drive default, need protected right.

This law works would insane, need constitutional amendment pass literally law. Technically true reality even close. It’s like car driving 100 mph straight cliff mosquito lands drivers arm. Sure next seconds dealing potential mosquito bite plunging death, scale two things disproportionate it’s laughable even compare stops anti-vaxxers saying ""yes, got vaccinated."" 

Is Walmart going demand medical records let shop there? TIL thank that. speak party king, else bear consequences. probably depend live many doses government ordered. Initially obviously going limited supply I'd guess maybe end next year vast majority population able get vaccine. Developed nations probably get developing countries I'm looking forward making money photoshopping fake vaccine certificates can't think building nevermind good circulation hallways, stairwells elevators.

BTW. think correct word ventilator. Swedish word respirator think means face mask something like english. bit confusing maybe someone enlighten me/us? Perhaps state live doesn’t allow indoor dining wedding receptions size. &amp;#x200B;

without ***TESTING*** positive.

***TESTING*** detects virus regardless symptoms.

asymptomatics matter. doubt would offset business travel happening, growth area. also suspect we'll see demand spaces host small groups 25 - 250 employees. see future office footprints accommodate portion team on-site given time, company wants everyone meet month quarter day-long meeting and/or team-building. look small event spaces, especially add something experience. could boost everything urban hotel meeting spaces breweries, museums, restaurants large areas privately rented. us quite while-it still undoubtedly required many places. Also, unless I've missed it, neither vaccine mfr announced vaccine provides *sterilizing* immunity; may provide *protective* immunity, meaning could still become infected potentially spread virus protected developing disease. follow script.

""Please bring us vaccination records.""

""If vaccination record, please get GP fill form XYZ medical exemption.""

""If religious reasons, please fill form ABC.""

""According 123 Independent School District's regulations, student must XYZ vaccinations. exemption outlined below, please fill forms. Please get doctor fill forms.""

Yadda yadda yadda. rules/regulations place. students meet exemptions, prove it. Otherwise, can't attend school done. Yes. decided happen. Yes, blinded. However, side effects shots (saline shot given) test positive antibodies - never sick Covid tested positive it. seeing huge number deaths today done cross check death register? expect kind number tomorrow? Vaccination wont thing unless mandatory.

Not entirely agreeing ""won't thing"", yes, mandatory protect either unable get vaccinated vaccine work — obviously, 90% efficacy still leaves 10% unprotected. buisiness travel, particular internationally, going economy class. get employer pay $4000 ticket fly conference across atlantic... One county CA people FFS. 

In Senate, largest states vote worth 1/68th smallest. Ie fuck people actually live, let empty land pigs vote too. can’t seriously dense, already paid entire US population MONTHS ago. whole point Operation Warp Speed... hell getting tested rn free charge... state may allow indoor dining weddings size, however. going way things. necessarily. wanted remove many potential issues possible, development testing conditions, however possible even likely kept regular freezer temperatures. Nah. folks vaccinated need live fear. don’t need eradicate virus, make rather rare. need keep clutching pearls. peer reviewed another press statement? always trust US government they've never done anything indicate can't trust basic functionality. think zoom better bad connections tho  absolutely pro-vax. kids date shots including flu shots, get flu shot annually (there's shortage I've able get one yet year). However, nervous Covid vaccine. Simply vaccines I've taken lifetime existed years Long term effects well established. Regardless, lining husband kids get first Covid vaccine available us.

Unfortunately though I'm sure right people like opting first wave two vaccines. Yeah...it's discouraging. There's much light horizon, know much virus back spring, early word vaccines far effective anyone really hoped, course new administration January actually gives damn people takes virus seriously.

And yet tens thousands, hundreds thousands going die, many suffer often brutal illness long-lasting effects, completely unnecessarily next months sacrifice single year's holiday celebrations. share data 18% diagnosed mental health problem 3 months?   takes one phone call friend's parent someone CPS get fixed right I'm sure.

As others medical reasons Im sure answer 3 technically true - plenty reservoirs virus shown erfectly capable infecting multiple species (cats, minks, bats etc.) know someone works healthcare worker, get thank too?  definitely mandatory. mean, placebo cause fever? trial can't impregnate anyone 2 years vaccination, apply every person planet receive receive vaccination next couple months? See comment section anyone Reddit like tests positive exposed mods get becomes wall . Here's one missed: another one saying doctors refuse treatment republicans, seems gone now. Can’t speak US Ontario, there’s already framework regards flu outbreaks many LTC homes. staff haven’t received annual flu shot, either can’t work pay Tamiflu pill pocket.

It’s much logical leap assume we’ll mandated receive vaccine COVID. said, I’ll probably front line, get 1-2 shots depending get next months.

I’m tired stress anxiety, lost time daughter year. Worrying bringing work. Fearful contracting worked 2 outbreaks already possible 3rd one now. Since developed tested short time, assurances patients long term effects impacts? relatives doctors let tell do. wrote; “ spend time researching causes it, masks distance yes, covid no”, didn’t understand implying masks distancing. Yeah fuck longterm testing Private business free set whatever rules want. wont government enforcing anything. No, article points study referring ~16%. 4%, think article referring to, one said 80% asymptomatic cases better thought presymptomatic, also using rounded numbers affected math. one sources article linked to: 79 studies range different settings, 20% (95% confidence interval [CI] 17%–25%, prediction interval 3%–67%) people SARS-CoV-2 infection remained asymptomatic follow-up, biases study designs limit certainty estimate.

It could higher reason, time it’s possible develop symptoms month fact never get diagnosed COVID. words, many people running around chronic fatigue, “brain fog,” etc. right covid infection never got tested don’t even realize cause symptoms? Funny mention this, conversation one clients yesterday exact issue. soft-core anti-vaxxer, doesnt want guinea pig etc preferring take year seeing happens people took vaccine. 

I think he's watched many movies ""science"" causes zombie outbreak. point change. yours? is? Sadly, leaders understand hospital capacity number piece paper, left mean used. tf won’t y’all come this??

i saw figure said cost $10 billion vaccinate everyone america, stimulus bill $2 *trillion*. $10 billion drop bucket compared that.

it’s best interest make free cheap possible way people feel confident returning work, shopping, eating restaurants going entertainment events. Dude, I've got preschooler. stayed home day two every time started get runny nose cough would spend half winter home. Would mask see theatre! Lol, getting paid poop work, wasting it. aren’t. Maybe stumble upon situation even unlikely Wish could that. really hope so. Let’s get fucking show road Assuming even read it, reading skills seriously lacking see linked article consistent everything I've written. What?... But, like flu shot vile probably latex top people may able get it. you’re denying things people literally cannot get vaccine they’re allergic. Antibodies could mean virus asymptomatic. Well voice low testicles removed wife.

We set mental health fund him. That’sWhatSheSaid!!!! Dammit! irony trust government making free, trust mandate profit vaccine? Neat   want one thing called clicks, care less vaccine. sure corporations want pandemic end soon could news websites. Golfing tweeting nothing help produce vaccine. Masks match outfit! work around WaPo.  thinking NYT easy workarounds. Pfizer didn’t take money operation warp speed

So trump say Pfizer charges personal quarantine question:

If tested positive began quarantine period family member tested positive 5 days later, quarantine period restart? hard google thought could ask here. Note: cases mild symptom free 2-3 days now. Thanks. “Ideally, vaccines would provide complete protection illness block person risk transmitting virus; however, vaccines could also provide range protection illness partially reduce chance shedding virus secretions.”

They dance around saying conclusively sake gotcha journalism.

Every vaccine kills transmission host, pretty silly think would work differently. already said yes twice.    
This means assumption disregarded 55 million deaths 2015 accurate, correct? Note words ‘with Covid’. need prescription.... Oof, saw today's numbers, great especially deaths. Ottawa two really good days row though (11 &amp; 22 new cases), seems like Toronto surrounding area problem currently. Everyone dies that's fact life. prevent death covid-19, knowledge spreads, lessen load hospitals get flooded cases lose lives doctors/essential workers.

Like imagine pulling nba telling lebron play basketball. respect passion game knowledge understand knows much basketball ever that's fine.

Now imagine countless doctors scientists telling us prevent spread. years medical school, years virus infectious diseases, respect listen experts do. 

Going life normally masks caring virus ignorant disrespectful years medical knowledge currently have. know going free right? constitutional challenge law court apply scrutiny test. highest level strict scrutiny requires said law 1. Necessary compelling state interest 2. Narrowly tailored achieve compelling purpose 3. Uses least restrictive means achieve purpose. 

In brown v board state failed step one thankfully court unanimously told government this. cases dealing vaccinations pandemic much closer call. 

Finally, didn’t understand that’s talking apologize. case enough supply available yet doubt state would create regulation like one would much harder pass test. online option available though might give chance. Generally would agree people living Sweden Finland def still memory narcolepsy cases tied Swine flu vaccine.  sounded like OP implied Germany can't turn away Swiss patients even due triage reasons mRNA production done lab, patient’s body? realized people run around thanking soldiers service ones wearing masks. I'm saying I'm superior way. choose live life see fit. They're used US carriers, they're definitely use others. know BA retired year, afaik Lufthansa, example, still flying decent numbers. flew FRA last year, taxied past whole lot 747s gates. point object: assess whether recommending surgical mask use outside home reduces wearers' risk SARS-CoV-2 infection setting masks uncommon among recommended public health measures. I’m also sick pretending masks created equal. not. masks protect wearer won’t. would imply it. Money talks sadly.

But could worse, McGowan stopped Clive ""Fatty McFuckhead"" Palmer barging way state showed important functioning economy one benefits billionaires. Useless theatre pretends effective reality, nearly nothing. tried weeks ago, testing positive antibodies, mods /r/IAma rejected me. Said interesting enough. worried go take it. vaccinated nothing worry Yes, ""not eating ham"" protected class. agree theory. reality that, every often, one maskless mother fuckers shoots stabs person yelling them. I'm willing play odds keep distance. think cross check - almost last 18 days. rather, think cross-check catching lot missed cases right now. One thing seen yet long good for? effective year? re-vaccinated every 6 months? permanent? may question time tell suppose. Oh no, could work anti-vaxxers' favour Oh come on. holidays nice time see family slow bit. latter still happen, former much. longest I’ve gone without seeing immediate family (since January). 

It‘s lame is. I’m thankful we’ve stayed healthy we’re willing put year’s gatherings may many years after. least I’ve got good friends I’ve formed so-called pod enjoy other’s company. 

The circumstances suck another poster said, days don’t suck. They’ll whatever make them. good news vaccine way.

So I'm vaccinated I'm going continue working home minimizing risk. wife immunodisorder we've inside since March, we've made far without seeing people another 6 months. (Even mother-in-law pissed let visit holidays) 

If people want run around go bars parties big events it, I'm done worrying it. 

The end sight, second half 2021 going huge party. nuts

I think may so. posted first paragraph describing ants absolutely perfect metaphor. Okay isn’t fair wonder vaccine could years injection? incredibly fast production time start finish. it’s almost vaccine

Any info this? ways actually different? hopefully changes stay too, like 6 foot apart markers grocery store checkout aisle. think OP talking $600/week unemployment add-on Sounds like getting tetanus shot. Moderna: say 94.5%? meant 95.01%. reminds sister first ""born christian"" preaching everyone everything often following things trying get others do. 

I live Midwest take vacation Colorado wave 2 wave 3. lot pre-planning make sure going areas low infection rates. drove 800ish miles. drive hour needed first day trip stay somewhere safer.

The hotel picked 4 star excellent protocols covid. Hand sanitizer everywhere, staff wore masks. social distancing enforced. activities outside. Less half meals eaten indoors didnt eat anywhere didnt feel safe. shops skipped lax policies. shops items would bought, missed sales. 

We 4 days got sinus infection. prone sinus infections get several year mostly winter. cool dry thin air perfect cause infection. stay coughing runny nose. considered trying wait room nice room, thin air made uncomfortable breath sick. 

We decided come home 4 days. suppose twice long. got home took covid test make sure negative. Within 2 days felt better. 

You couldnt get go vacation $1 million waiting end vacation. get anxious seeing someone properly wearing mask grocery store now. providing example. may enjoy going watch sport events, many people do. Nope New York, relaying frontline healthcare worker time told me. also thought beds treating people hallways I'm 100% positive that. Full send Haha can't wait give government corporations control goes body!

Not anti-vax way. Vaccines work. Mandating vaccine developed less year insane. happened original swine flu vaccine trials.... especially GBS. you’re one unlucky doesn’t work for.

If it’s like flu vaccine , presume would still reduce severity symptoms Thank wife much work doing. truly sorry selfish assholes largely responsible prolonged dangerous environments currently in. BC accelerating despite new measures.  can't find source TSA screened like 450k passengers found want say hundred running fevers. Even assuming none false positives (and doubt were), that's great screening rate. Temperature checks made sense paper practice they're effective. &lt;pulls pants exposes single buttock Sadly, one rando study takes likes FOXNEW's ""talent"" browbeat viewership mock taking pandemic seriously. point repackaging analogy kind infuriating. inshoukd really let bother much 1 1'000 North Dakotans? whats fucking next 7 every 100 black jewish guys named daniel died COVID-19. smh. Terrible Nonetheless. Dr Fauci says can. call boss asshole til cows come home, reality Americans still don’t choice. works says come sick, come sick find someone else will.

Nobody goes work sick *want* work sick. Nobody would didn’t way another feel compelled to. -80c common temperature field understand, yes even fine, little hassle otherwise. Ok see going I'm wasting time repeating accessible information contrarian, using weak flexible arguments feel superior. transparent dude... big guy really think mexican food chicago better place majority hispanic? ridiculous. danish news papers reporting conclusion is, masks provide significant protection, actually study concludes cannot conclude anything. 

Also mentioned study carried month lowest number Corona cases general.

Embarrassing piece ""science"". Considering vaccines take 10-15 years get process, unbelievably fast. huge thanks goes scientists anyone else helped this, truly remarkable. even little bit concerned vaccine? antivax, sus quickly happened. consider amount data have; much. we're going amount cities, Wyoming zero state anymore. bunch states cities basically baby cities, combine well. showing us bad arrogant smug arrogant smug? Thank sacrifice. Ladies gentlemen, got Uhhh handguns definitely defensive weapon. opinion matter means zero, due objective fact 95% better flu shot percentage? Sheesh. Sounds like it. hope continues get better you! don’t like people standing close me. Never have. There’s plenty space. hope continue spread out. 95% good gets. Anything would show within month would already shown trial. One article read said needs extreme lows longer term storage, last week standard refrigerator/freezer (I forget which, matter, common) temps. would get Italy even aware September 2019 truly started testing studying Feb March? Honest question. saying forever going pinned Wuhan released first genome?  Wow I’m surprised. fearmongering extent immunity ridiculous. Hopefully settle it. Agreed, friend. Stay safe I'm bit lost point now. saying cheaper bigger pool people could use it? agree that. Fuck media Yeah. People worried unknown side effects. Fuck that. Give juice already. going keep close eye vaccine results. See European regulators say. couple science podcasts say including BBC NPR ones. I'll take vaccine unless something fishy shown reputable source. guess might counted skeptic one surveys depending exact question. proof acquired. thank u God hate correct is. Shit like makes argument regulating media effectively. I'm saying limit free speech. would like limits blatant fear mongering disinformation. I'm tired stupid commentary speculation held comparable hard facts proven outcomes. current state media money politics biggest problem country. Taiwan got control first ignoring them. Thank work. sister nurse even though doesn’t work Covid unit know it’s stressful think bringing home deadly virus. Thank everything trust lesser covid side effects tbh main thing one stored fridge needs stored something like -80C. I'm anti-vaxx I'm fucking terrified newly fast developed vaccine literally one knowing long term side effects. thought hazard pay healthcare workers wers promised, think right. 
Either way, shitty.  Honestly, baseline cases drop near zero.

Sure vaccine might 90-95% effective, there's reason layer protective methods. 4 billion people dont internet we're expecting vaccinate them? going happen. India china nearly 50% world population supplies secured really stop acting like everyone get one particular vaccine all. remaining question get dose?

And long last much cost? constitution US never amended give federal government power, guess shows ignorance US’s history federalized government acting like OP 90? OP likely 20s nobody healthy died Nah, politics. help enemies to. segment run news. also published local Louisiana/Arkansas/Mississippi news site. I’m sorry view narrow. Developed BionTech btw need ultra cold storage already created plan deliver store 15 days without freezer. vaccine given quickly first months isn’t likely last 15 days original container. Like h1n1 assume lines people arriving get vaccine everyday. get downvoted? using basic elementary math see took us since march get almost 250k. tf get 400k month?  mutation affected vaccines. Even mink one.  I'm pregnant due April. guess give I'm pregnant, wonder hospital deliver. one immediate family contacted covid. son preschool haven't. wash hands, wear masks, wear gloves. 

For me, fear unknown. Thank Almost like Covid. Completely safe everyone small exceptions work perfectly 0.01% mortality rate? know exactly “free” means case

Just like “free” (tax payer funded) college. 

Nothing life free except death. Everything else gets payed one way another friend. Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla cash 60% stock day announced ""miracle cure""? anymore witnessing needledick Yea, added edit commented back, re-read comment realized that. Thanks dick, trying one either. Question - front line worker receives vaccine \~95% effective, mean worker longer needs HASMAT-level protective gear around Covid19 patients? guess root question 5% ineffectiveness exactly? simply work 1:20 recipients? effective 95% exposure scenarios? latter makes think front line workers could still risk due heavy exposure vaccine widely distributed. Grocery store cashiers lucky. hope everything goes well. I’m glad they’re way terms transportation storage.


I feel like part trial small way saying thank healthcare workers they’ve done family earlier year (not COVID related). couldn’t join trial knowing much could help healthcare workers. Sort accident. I'm 50's got computers everything starting take off. commodore vic 20 lead people thinking expert. lead helping local doctors slowly grew learned phones, video surveillance, cabling, anything else make useful customers. thing is, technology constantly changing server orders declined apps moved cloud. workstation next? look like guys like 10 years? perhaps everyone terminal really nothing onsite support entire desktop cloud. pushed learn cloud technologies keep pace change feel safe retire 7 years. Beyond really knows. one thing say certain feel like work look forward day get work technology. Good luck. **A randomized trial 6,000 participants Denmark adds new evidence known whether masks protect wearer SARS-CoV-2 infection setting public health measures, including social distancing, effect others wearing masks.**

The DANMASK-19 trial randomized participants follow public health measures without additional recommendation wear surgical mask outside home. Mask use outside hospitals uncommon Denmark time. 1 month follow-up, 1.8% participants mask group 2.1% control group developed infection. evidence excludes large personal protective effect mask wearing, weakly supports lesser degrees protection, cannot definitively exclude effect. findings published Annals Internal Medicine.

Researchers Copenhagen University Hospital recruited 6,024 adults spent least 3 hours per day outside homes, whose occupations require masks, previous known diagnosis SARS-CoV-2 infection. Participants randomized mask group control group mask group given supply surgical masks. participants completed weekly surveys antibody tests PCR testing COVID-19 symptoms developed, 1 month. **At conclusion trial, infection rates similar two groups.**

Of note, Danish authorities recommend masks study period use community uncommon. Public transportation shops remained open recommended public health measures included quarantine persons SARS-CoV-2 infection, social distancing, limiting number people seen, frequent hand hygiene cleaning, limited visitors hospitals nursing homes.

According study authors, findings offer evidence degree protection mask wearers anticipate setting others wearing masks public health measures, including social distancing, effect. findings, however, used conclude recommendation everyone wear masks community would effective reducing SARS-CoV-2 infections, trial test role masks source control (transmission infected person others) SARS-CoV-2 infection.

The editors Annals Internal Medicine chose publish DANMASK-19 trial well-designed study provides important piece evidence understand puzzle control COVID-19 pandemic. also note U.S. Centers Disease Control recently updated guidance acknowledge masks, worn all, may reduce transmission source control personal protection. say DANMASK-19 trial conflict guidelines, shows contribution risk reduction personal protection likely less source control. health workers going stop showing work.

They already quitting profession overworked stress dealing covid deniers.  Again, completely made up, unsourced assertions win arguments. Ehh hmmm, “she” thank much Considering least 10 days behind curve countries Europe would guess gonna peak something like 50-60 deaths per day weakly average gets better. actions Sweden taken far work limit spread. Thanks! didn’t see it! Yeah thinking thing heard “700M doses April” (of various vaccine candidates course) interpreted general pop. start around February doses continue roll in, April there’ll enough everyone, rather starting April. I’ve seen lot varying interpretations idk sure it’ll work. Correct. ND pretty low mortality spring compared example NYC high mask use? Perhaps anecdotal data science. completely understand! see vaccine rushed, appreciate opinion people worried. anything, consider volunteer test subject. never said problem places. said far common storage condition liquid drugs test. Yes, likely go hospital get it. necessarily think that's bad thing considering they're already prepped handle large amounts people proper covid precautions. bad widespread access quickly possibly better health populace long term guess. understood they’re control logistics. sense we’re hiring UPS handle distribution, we’re going use military’s logistics handle it. Freezer trucks, staging area etc. military, like fedex ups, bases equipment necessary it. It’s one way keep free. don’t think military going administering it. Probably like it’ll stored base near delivered dr office military trucks. saying ""stay home hoard masks first responders need them"" assuming people dumb? think government lied us like American government did? quite. Moderna's vaccine last half year normal kitchen freezer month refrigerator. Pfizer's vaccine needs super chilled last 5 days normal freezer, going bad within hours thawing.

Pfizer's also needs diluted distribution site, Moderna's ready go box. question that, actually, someone takes car drives italy spain comes back infected, detected somehow? 

we rely good willing people keep quarantine, according mr van gucht, belgians ""well known"" looking loopholes...

who crazier? crazy crazy allows many crazy things? capable understanding false equivalency is, made statement. “I hope not” it’s Fauci knew going give conservative estimate opening article That's bit know. I've recently noticed social media exploding anti vaxxers recent days weeks. let's hope they're minority I'm gonna need proof works healthcare hand thank u alright 99.75% recovery rate. told cure end year. Well said.  desperate things remain shit invent scenarios head put damper good news comes lmfao Coronavirus issued holiday statement:

""Our trillion voices thankful!
We *never* thought would chance us still around America, much less thriving setting records total victories new replication factories.

We respect joyous Thanksgiving celebrations long interests"". Someone’s paying this. Pfizer charge want, people say “free” mean government absorbs cost vaccine distributed without counter cost. brother might gotten covid second time EMT job test frequently. I'm ready vaccine. See I’m opposite. Traveling work allowed see much country/world may opportunity otherwise. thoroughly celebrate environmental impact I’m definitely going miss personal level think also mentioned one press meetings weeks ago longer ventilated IVA.

Couldn't give link though. Considering they’re different viruses, no. Doesn’t seem odd all. Dry ice. Absolutely. Sorry I'm going sacrifice health general public. would ask family take either others went first. wear mask shield work distance myself. family go restaurants whatnot. I'll take chances without vaccine. hear ""It's unusual drugs bad side effects discovered they've wild"" claim lot, there's actually much support it.

Out abundance caution looked it, can't actually find example vaccine unexpected long-term side effects. happen chemical pharmaceuticals like thalidomide (which FDA never cleared, BTW) never biologically-based vaccine.

If find study peer-reviewed journal showing one, I'm happy revise opinion. So, hospitals around country struggling. Some, like El Paso, resorting drastic measures. anyone know FEMA is? heard helping hospitals. I'm sure negligence part Trump instructing help. doctor healthcare worker ages since undergrad biology coursework (sadly stopped bio major, despite halfway done it) - mRNA stands messenger RNA right? needs get everywhere though. still effectively flu already jumped back animals possibly back again. Vaccinating half world letting run roughshod rest means back years mutating. That’s insane. test every patient surgery. Hospital fiancée works allowing visitors anymore asymptomatic visitor came see spouse passed doctors say it’s going kill due reason hospitalized. That's unreasonable. get shot mean virus suddenly disappears. What's unreal can't bothered put lightweight material face months save lives many better years come. selfish. Oh yh. Limited doses first probably means it'll reserved healthcare workers vulnerable. may able get late next year I'd say live developed country. Developing nations may wait longer Dude, I’m part group (Muslim) I’m telling right already know everything need know lol. benefit giving little fight thing fine me. None security concerns matter we’re dead Stop lying. Danish newspapers reporting this, all. seen single one, please provide link broad strokes, yeah. try social distance never go anywhere public without mask. ask isolate home, will. government lockdowns involved shutting business really drastic measures like that, yeah would problem.

I wear mask, social distance, isolate **when needed** think help pandemic. I've done research, reason believe measures help pandemic immensely everyone follow them.  [Excess death figures might well start eating now. feeling Thanksgiving see influx people hospitals listen warnings,

The numbers usually 2-3 week delay yeah expect big jump cases. Country roads get stern warning.  actually reason it, though. First easiest explain timing all. ND see much surge September cases growing significantly since then. means yet seen worst deaths also hospitals starting overrun. Timing also relevant COVID still relatively new disease, already know far treat March April, meaning much greater likelihood survival. Additionally, ND actually enough resources handle far, relative population size. example, they're one leaders testing per capita (or anyway - may changed since last checked). However, we're starting see hospitals getting overrun resources run low, expect numbers continue rise unless really get things control. people get vaccine. may say won’t right now, parts society start moving without obvious health risks they’ll cave. Oh ok thanks Yes read genuine question kind everyone asking encouraged ask. really troubles politicised reactionary conversations around become. Shhh, tell anyone. realize visit bad anywhere else. healthcare worker VA can't quite tell I'm going get vaccinated first last. kinda wonder can: got April permanent lung damage I'm partially scared compromised way. I'm 32 doctor pretty firm next catch could last, sort deal. You’ve got careful comparing statistics like this; 90% 95% numbers come error bars attached, can’t confidently say *actual* efficacy different. 

What say stunningly effective across wide range ages. Hooray! researched immunity sounds like lasts months, according studies done many patients Arizona locations. got negative test results today I’m going back work work home. 

I want know anyone knows immunity. surefire thing maybe could actually go visit parents Christmas. would want go see totally safe.

Does immune mean can’t get Covid? mean could get wouldn’t feel effects? 

If means can’t get it, would mean couldn’t pass parents might able visit Christmas. okay combining Daokats together admitting DC 50th state. would also okay Puerto Rico becoming state well. Every person 40 pre-existing conditions. That's happens older get. Honestly live area safe take walks wonders (masked obviously!) vaccine ineffective supposed new strain even confirmed? Guess missed Laughs Australian. scrolling me!  Thank fellow health care workers last year! Yess we've year now. Stay strong stay safe wife. failed experiment....yea dunno man America dope af. I’ve lot countries every single one sucked compared America.

Go. Travel. Discover yourself. arguments convincing feel swayed point view. coronavirus circulating? Cold Covid though? I'm open possibility circulation way earlier Dec, actual genetic sequencing information proves simple cold, could either.  Invited owner look around. Lol never going happen considering enough doses till end next year  would love see ~~math~~ meth used come number Past time crank ultra-cold freezers. get first dose, 2nd dose 3 weeks later, week good go, right? Well, assuming one unlucky work for.

Obviously I'd still wear mask everywhere (both case work others vaccinated) making sure understand means.

Man hope get around mid-April. I'd love able finally see family Memorial Day. dumb? swear people site read replies reply without adjusting new discussion. irrelevant, claimed rejection people simply distrust vaccine quickly developed, majority even know mRNA is. think that's polemic claim. Weinstein kill himself. getting way. tell anything giving blood. restrictions told wear condom couple weeks (during heterosexual sex, wearing one around house) get flu vaccine month second dose. that, that's it. Life usual. like blood dangerous. 
If want donate blood find out, can't stop you. doubt does, necessarily benefit alone. thinking victims. ohhh yeah Compulsory Vacination time 😎 Note applies asymptomatic. case, even crazier thing apparently inline CDC recommendations. 🤦‍♂️ but, like COVID really isn’t cause death, death people 9/11 due crash, fires, suicides. So, can’t REALLY blame terrorist. drove planes. Or...

There another coronavirus happened produce cross neutralizing antibodies. Many still calling hoax they're intubated. Italian study supporting case novel coronavirus circulating outside China earlier thought sparked doubts among Western scientists called tests. paper published Italian Cancer Institute describes presence neutralizing antibodies SARS-CoV-2 blood taken healthy patients Italy October last year lung cancer screening trial. data correct, would change history pandemic raise questions virus emerged. would normally high-risk group COVID-19, puzzling patients asymptomatic.

The World Health Organization said new coronavirus COVID-19, respiratory disease causes, unknown Wuhan outbreak reported. said possibility virus may “silently circulated elsewhere” cannot ruled out. least 55,573,000 reported infections 1,336,000 reported deaths caused COVID-19 globally since virus first detected China.

**UNEXPECTED DETECTION**

China believes Italian study shows tracing origin virus ongoing process may involve many countries. “China continue working rest international community contribute global cooperation fighting COVID-19 viruses,”, Zhao Lijian, spokesman Chinese foreign ministry, told reporters Beijing Tuesday. Italy’s first COVID-19 patient detected Feb. SARS-CoV-2 antibodies test carried University Siena research paper, called “Unexpected detection SARS-CoV-2 antibodies pre-pandemic period Italy”.

It showed six cases, antibodies able kill SARS-CoV-2.

Both Italian scientists said antibody test in-house designed never validated researchers peer review. also noticeable high seroprevalence research study’s population, said, referring percentage people may exposed virus. scientists’ scepticism focuses called specificity antibody tests, that, perfect, might reveal presence antibodies diseases. “Other recent reports shown seasonal coronaviruses elicit cross-neutralizing antibodies,” said Jonathan Stoye, group leader Francis Crick Institute.

“I think need really conclusive demonstration samples picking COVID-19 virus antibodies actually triggered another virus,” Andrew Preston, reader microbial pathogenesis University Bath, told Reuters. gone, contact China,” Giovanni Apolone told Reuters, calling colleagues globally “open databases conduct retrospective researches”. one reasons even two dakotas conservatives could get four senators making states. want spoil believe good news someone explain manufacturing logistics process me?

So long take get vaccines large part population? Europe free (paid EU funds) everyone saving inheritance. scientific evidence back statement curiositykilled1? I'll take 4! coworkers hospital finally able get vaccinated. Leaving home everyday go work knowing get infected anytime scary, since running low PPE. I'm tired mentally physically last month meeting prepare next wave! Oh God going end?!!! 😫😫 It’s New Jersey’s plan. states might different. would check see local health department vaccination plan available. dont mind last one.

Not doubting it, missed expensive part basically daycare bit. kept kids home, lot adults difficulty going jobs, need supported. That's government want do.  happens 5% Throw Montana Wyoming it. [archive link anyone trouble accessing article Youre joke works, opposite way think does.

These people died 'with' COVID, 'of'. yes, using numbers way like saying someone died car accident, died cancer covid trumped 9/11 death toll? one things hindsight though. remember commenting first wave lockdowns introduced lockdown saves lives, cases drop deaths drop, people see lockdown overreaction hope meant non-perishables. still unclear, possible would less severe even first shot level immune response. Nooooo! You’re saying part country called BS science public health recommendations rough time? Awesome true! conversations I've had, think deniers terrified. Seeing mask reminds might real. real absolutely terrifying them. seeing masks means can't real safe. nobody allowed wear mask, would make real. logic ""what know can't hurt me"". doesn’t make sense all. Maybe people get deliveries took less precaution outside? Seems strange. check congressional approval rating, check incumbent success rate. 

people assume chosen candidate exception see that. year made businesses embrace remote working.  I’m sure he’s fan covid, 19 easily spread keeping expectations low guess It’s real shame. like Bogo sort lmao. worries, emphasizing said press conference wasn’t true problem politician ordered over-reaction lose his/her election campaign sure.

therefore, never happened. point making covid always listed contributing cause long detected. may wrong, yet seen data refute claim. hoping review process goes smoothly. vaccine, along Moderna vaccine, could save many lives. lockdowns work well California many cases? longest strictest lockdown country.

Yep! test positive them. wrote elsewhere, many places US free antibody tests available, low cost ones. lot blood banks give free test donation. Win - win one. God bless them. God save Yes. got second shot. told donate blood. place free antibodies test blood bank. places want 200 antibodies test. important caveat, mean 1 600 people died COVID. means died 'with' COVID.

If society awash COVID hospitals care homes numbers massively skewed using 'with' measure. everyone COVID, would appear, using measure, everyone dies died COVID

I'm downplaying all, serious virus collapsing health systems, 1 600 New Yorkers died COVID. That's they're conditioned! Ha. little sister could drink table.

Check. Mate. 👋 but👋 my👋 freedoms👋 6.	Magical Thinking

Back April, Trump imagined pandemic’s quick end: “Maybe goes away heat light,” said. start, others wondered hot, humid weather might curb spread COVID-19, coronavirus diseases. Many experts countered seasonal effects wouldn’t stop new virus, already spreading tropics. But, fueled shaky science speculative stories, people widely latched seasonality possible savior, virus proved could thrive Arizona, Texas, Florida summer. 

This brand magical thinking, factor naturally defuses pandemic, become convenient excuse inaction. Recently, commentators argued pandemic imminently fizzle two reasons. First, 20 50 percent people defensive T-cells recognize new coronavirus, previously exposed milder, common-cold-causing cousins. Second, modeling studies claim herd immunity—whereby virus struggles find new hosts, enough people immune—could kick 20 percent population infected.

Neither claim implausible, neither grounds complacency. one yet knows “cross-reactive” T-cells actually protect COVID-19, even do, they’re unlikely stop people getting infected. Herd immunity, meanwhile, perfect barrier. Even low thresholds correct, fast-growing uncontrolled outbreak still shoot past them. Pursuing strategy mean that, winter, many parts U.S. may suffer New York City endured spring: thousands deaths untold number lingering disabilities. alone argument …

7.	The Complacency Inexperience

When illness averted lives spared, “nothing happens miracle normal, healthy day,” says Howard Koh, public-health professor Harvard. “People take granted.” Public-health departments chronically underfunded suffering prevent invisible. Pandemic preparations deprioritized peaceful years outbreaks. Even now, many people spared ravages COVID-19 argue disease wasn’t big deal, associate woes preventive measures. problem still disease measures prevented: economy still hurting, mental-health problems growing, educational futures curtailed, fearmongering overreaction, uncontrolled pandemic still afoot.

If anything, U.S. react swiftly strongly enough. Nations previously dealt emerging viral epidemics, including several East Asia sub-Saharan Africa, quick take new coronavirus seriously. contrast, America’s lack similar firsthand experience, combined sense exceptionalism, might contributed initial sloppiness. “One colleagues went Rwanda February, soon hit airport, asked symptoms, checked temperature, took phone number,” says Abraar Karan, internist Brigham Women’s Hospital Harvard Medical School. “In U.S., flew July, walked airport, questions asked.”

Even virus began spreading within U.S., places weren’t initially pummeled seemed forget viruses spread. “In April, seeing COVID patients ER every day,” Karan says. “In Texas, friends saying, ‘No one believes cases.’ L.A., fellow physicians said, ‘Are sure worse flu? We’re seeing anything.’” Three months later, Texas California saw COVID-19 closely. tendency ignore threats directly affect us consigned U.S. …

8.	A Reactive Rut

In March, Mike Ryan World Health Organization advised, “Be fast, regrets … virus always get don’t move quickly.” U.S. failed heed warning, repeatedly found several steps behind coronavirus. That’s partly exponential growth counterintuitive, “we don’t understand things look fine right they’re fine,” says Beth Redbird, sociologist Northwestern. It’s also coronavirus spreads quickly slow reveal itself: take month infections lead symptoms, symptoms warrant tests hospitalizations, enough sick people produce noticeable spike. Pandemic data like light distant stars, recording past events instead present ones. lag separates actions consequences enough time break intuition cause effect. Policy makers end acting it’s late. Predictable surges get falsely cast unexpected surprises.

This reactive rut also precludes long-term planning. April, Michael Osterholm, epidemiologist University Minnesota, told “people haven’t understood [the pandemic] isn’t next couple weeks [but] next two years.” Leaders taken long view then. “We thinking would take ensure schools open fall, prevent long-term harms lost children’s development,” Redbird says. Instead, started working way serial monogamy solutions, and, like spiraling army ants, marched forward sense future beyond next footsteps.

These errors crop disasters. COVID-19 pandemic special qualities exacerbated them. virus moved quickly enough upend status quo months, deepening allure hastily abandoned past. also moved slowly enough sweep U.S. patchwork fashion, allowing as-yet-untouched communities drop guard. pandemic grew huge scope, entangling every aspect society, maxing capacity deal complexity. “People struggle make rational decisions cannot see cogs,” says Njoki Mwarumba, emergency-management professor University Nebraska Omaha. Full fear anxiety, people furiously searched information, virus new, instead spiraled confusion uncertainty. tragically, happened presidency Donald Trump.

Trump embodied amplified America’s intuition death spiral. Instead rolling detailed, coordinated plan control pandemic, ricocheted one overhyped cure-all another, relying theatrics travel bans. ignored inequities systemic failures favor blaming China, WHO, governors, Anthony Fauci, Barack Obama. widened false dichotomy lockdowns reopening regularly tweeting favor latter. allies appealed magical thinking steered U.S. straight normality trap frequently lying virus would go away, pandemic ending, new waves weren’t happening, rising case numbers solely due increased testing. started talking COVID-19 past tense cases surge Midwest.

“It’s like mass gaslighting,” says Martha Lincoln, medical anthropologist San Francisco State University. “We put situation better solutions closed lot people fact sneak them. absence robust federal response, we’re left washing hands hoping best, makes us susceptible magical thinking individual-level fixes.” fixes never come, “I think people going harden fatalistic sense accept whatever risks continue everyday lives.” obviously terrible. think difference 2,000+ people murdered 9/11. death toll quite clearly worse COVID. Trust me, I’m COVID denier. Bane says would painful hope toilet paper hoarders last vaccinated. They’re already protected bog roll fort, don’t need jabs immediately. questions:

1.	Have disclosed long protection last? Like 1 year? (Influenza) 2,5,10 years?
2.	What would right approach rollout this? try apply vaccine majority population time? mean even 2-4 effective vaccines early 2021, see people still trying get shot mid 2022? 
3.	Even get vaccine, virus would still live air/environment ? die go away maybe 2030? Like old diseases? think read article summer :) going help prevent people dying though, don’t see countries much vaccines They've taught dehumanize others pursuit selfish needs. message clear. disposable. True. you’re talking reasonable people taking dynamic situation adjusting accordingly. 

Also, really serious fuckup CDC say back then. Yes, they’ve adjusted bad advice even back then! 

Anyway, tell dad point! 
Whatever happened past, past. need react fast correctly knowledge now. LAPD probably hands full trying enforce cerfew. 🙄

I pretty much guarantee statewide curfew (as allegedly consideration) go widely ignored, included like night walks (albeit, solo rural area, ironically, would actually riskier, COVID-wise, police try stop leave be).  Scariest thing death bed using last words express rage anger denial covid. That's constitutional right. That's ok schools require kids receive certain vaccines get numbers? Legend. There's roughly three week lag tests deaths. weeks deaths reflect cases found week prior 28 Oct, 70-80k daily cases reported. week's daily cases around 160k daily. Death toll three weeks \~2400/d.

Of course, could higher triaging begun (eg, elderly patients given paliative/hopice care). Thanksgiving Christmas clusters loom.

IHME remains curvefitting exercise. useful (and scientists don't) discredit ignore studies simply yet subject peer review. Same. live North Jersey, too. honestly even know anyone who's it. I'm fortunate. Thanks much! I'm definitely pro vaccine wondered 95 low consistent others. huh??? Yes well looks like that's what's happened comment makes sense. good get corrected troubling seems happen start often hard overcome downward trend comment and/or gets hidden bottom.  way avoided 🙄 less likely vaccine protected class though. means lawsuits. Keep mind can't get care due overwhelmed hospitals, CFR case fatility rate closer hospitalization rate (somewhere around 5-15% vs 0.5-2% now). number cases keeps rising holds 500k - 1 million new cases / day (or higher ☠), deaths could go millions time, mere 400k. exponental growth works real world figure overwhelmed healthcare system. even begin address deaths non-pandemic causes like heart attacks due overwhelmed hospitals. Business travel vacation.  Yea, clearly idea it’s quite sad. literally constitutional right could think would broken business said “you cannot use services you’re vaccinated” “you cannot work us you’re vaccinated”  Oh wow that’s crazy. Thanks sharing! 

Cool name! Peer reviews big deal? planet living on?

Also ironic mention”armchair scientist” people praising press release minimum it’s putting American flag Oldsmobile Chevy “supporting” troops. YES! it’s virus can’t see shuts Applebees. NOOOOO! surface, not. Private property ban reason. However, lot sports teams' stadiums built taxpayer money changes things. Now, winter looms pandemic continues, another dichotomy emerged: enter another awful lockdown, let virus run free. choice, too, false. Public-health measures offer middle road, even “lockdowns” need overbearing spring. city could close higher-risk venues like bars nightclubs opening lower-risk ones like retail stores. There’s “whole control panel dials” offer, “it’s hard conversation people think light switch,” says Lindsay Wiley, professor public-health law American University. “The term lockdown done lot damage.” exacerbated false binary shutting opening up, offering …

3.	The Comfort Theatricality

Stay-at-home orders saved lives curtailing COVID-19’s spread, giving hospitals breathing room. orders also meant buy time nation ramp public-health defenses. Instead, White House treated months physical distancing pandemic-ending strategy itself. “We squandered time terms scaling testing contact tracing, enacting policies protect workers get infected job, getting protective equipment people food-processing plants, finding places people isolate, offering paid sick leave … still don’t things,” says Julia Marcus, infectious-disease epidemiologist Harvard Medical School regular Atlantic contributor. country facing fall many problems plagued summer.

Showiness often mistaken effectiveness. coronavirus mostly spreads air rather contaminated surfaces, many businesses nonetheless trying scrub bleach way toward reopening. colleague Derek Thompson calls hygiene theater—dramatic moves appear offer safety without actually so. charge applies temperature checks, can’t detect many COVID-19 patients don’t fever. also applies porous inefficient travel bans Trump allies still tout policy successes. tactics might good—let’s conflate imperfect useless—but cause harm substitute stronger measures. Theatricality breeds complacency. emphasizing solutions easily seen, exacerbated American preference ...

4.	Personal Blame Systemic Fixes

SARS-CoV-2 spread rapidly among America’s overstuffed prisons understaffed nursing homes, communities served overstretched hospitals underfunded public-health departments, among Black, Latino, Indigenous Americans geographically financially disconnected health care decades racist policies. Without paid sick leave living wage, “essential workers” earn low, hourly income could afford quarantine fell ill—and especially would jeopardize jobs health care tied. “The things stay safe, don’t option,” says Whitney Robinson, social epidemiologist University North Carolina Chapel Hill.

But tattered social safety nets less visible crowded bars. Pushing universal health care harder shaming unmasked stranger. Fixing systemic problems difficult spewing moralism, Americans gravitated toward latter. News outlets illustrated pandemic articles (often distorted) photos beaches, even though open-air spaces offer low-risk ways people enjoy themselves. Marcus attributes tendency America’s puritanical roots, conflate pleasure irresponsibility, prize shame support. “The shaming gets codified bad policy,” says. Chicago fenced beach, Honolulu closed beaches, parks, hiking trails, leaving riskier indoor businesses open.

Moralistic thinking jeopardizes health two ways. First, people often oppose measures reduce individual’s risk—seat belts, condoms, HPV vaccines—because protections might promote risky behavior. pandemic, experts used reasoning question value masks, University Michigan’s president argued testing students widely would offer “false sense security.” paternalistic false-assurance arguments almost always false themselves. “There’s little evidence overcompensation point safety measures harm,” Bergstrom says.

Second, misplaced moralism provide cover bad policies. Many colleges started semester in-person teaching inadequate testing, predictably dealing large outbreaks. UNC Chapel Hill lasted six days reverting remote classes. Administrators chastised students behaving irresponsibly, taking responsibility setting fail—a pattern likely continue fall college clusters inevitably grow. “If put 10,000 [students] small space, eating, sleeping, socializing together, there’ll explosion cases,” Robinson says. “I don’t know [colleges] expecting.” Perhaps fell prey …

5.	The Normality Trap

In times uncertainty upheaval, “people crave return familiar, predictable rhythms,” says Monica Schoch-Spana, medical anthropologist Johns Hopkins Center Health Security. pull especially strong pandemic’s toll largely invisible. There’s nothing dramatic ruined buildings lapping floodwater hint world changed. circles, returning normal valorized act defiance. That’s reasonable stance resisting terrorists, seek stoke fear, dangerous one fighting virus, doesn’t care.

The powerful desire re-create old world obscure trade-offs necessary surviving new one. Keeping high-risk indoor businesses open, example, helps virus spread within community, makes reopening schools harder. “If schools priority, put ahead something. something?” says Bill Hanage, epidemiologist Harvard. “In ideal world, would last close first open, many communities, casinos, bars, tattoo parlors opened them.” world COVID-19 fundamentally different one without it, former simply cannot include trappings latter. Cherished summer rituals like camps baseball games already lost; back-to-school traditions Thanksgiving hang balance. Change hard accept, predisposes people … Antivaxxers cause major problems though immunity likely temporary. get herd immunity means taking vaccine yearly foreseeable future. vaccine nasty described like hangover several days. huffingtonpost.ca may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage, post automatically removed. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

Many Americans trusted intuition help guide disaster. grabbed onto whatever solution prominent moment, bounced one (often false) hope next. saw actions individual people taking, blamed shamed neighbors. lapsed magical thinking, believed world would return normal within months. Following impulses simpler navigating web solutions, staring broken systems, accepting pandemic would rage least year.

These conceptual errors egregious lies conspiracy theories, still dangerous. manifested again, distorting debate around whether stay home, wear masks, open colleges. prevented citizens grasping scope crisis pushed leaders toward bad policies. instead overriding misleading intuitions calm considered communication, leaders intensified them. country trapped intuition nightmare: Like spiraling ants, Americans walled unhelpful instincts, lead round round self-destructive circles.

“The grand challenge is, adjust thinking match problem us?” says Lori Peek, sociologist University Colorado Boulder studies disasters. Here, then, nine errors intuition still hamstring U.S. pandemic response, glimpse future continue unchecked. time break free now. pandemic summer nearly over. come fall, season preparation, winter, season survival. U.S. must reset mindset accomplish both. Ant death spirals break enough workers accidentally blunder away, creating trails lead spiraling workers safety. humans don’t rely luck; unlike ants, capacity introspection.

The spiral begins people forget controlling pandemic means many things once. virus spread symptoms appear, easily five P’s: people prolonged, poorly ventilated, protection-free proximity. stop spread, country could use measures nations did, great effect: close nonessential businesses spaces allow crowds congregate indoors; improve ventilation; encourage mask use; test widely identify contagious people; trace contacts; help isolate themselves; provide social safety net people protect others without sacrificing livelihood. None nations everything, enough things right—and simultaneously. contrast, U.S. engaged …

1.	A Serial Monogamy Solutions

Stay-at-home orders dominated March. Masks fiercely debated April. Contact tracing took turn May. Ventilation moment now. “It’s like attention one thing time,” says Natalie Dean, biostatistician University Florida.

As often happens, people sought easy technological fixes complex societal problems. months, President Donald Trump touted hydroxychloroquine COVID-19 cure, even rigorous studies showed isn’t one. August, switched attention convalescent plasma—the liquid fraction COVID-19 survivor’s blood might contain virus-blocking antibodies. There’s still clear evidence century-old approach treat COVID-19 either, despite grossly misstated claims FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn (for later apologized). generally, drugs might save sickest patients, dexamethasone does, shorten hospital stay, remdesivir does, unlikely offer outright cures. “It’s reassuring think magic-bullet treatment wait, it’ll come things normal,” Dean says.

Other strategies merit, wrongly dismissed imperfect. July, Carl Bergstrom, epidemiologist sociologist science University Washington, argued colleges cannot reopen safely without testing students upon entry. “The gotcha question I’ve handled reporters since is: school entry testing, get outbreak?” says. It’s testing necessary safe reopening, sufficient. “If screw everything else up, you’ll still big outbreak,” Bergstrom adds.

This brief attention span understandable. Adherents scientific method trained isolate change one variable time. Academics walled different disciplines rarely connect. Journalists constantly look new stories, shifting attention next great idea. factors prime public view solutions isolation, means imperfections become conflated uselessness. example, many critics masks argued provide partial protection virus, often don’t fit well, people wear incorrectly. protection clearly better protection. Dylan Morris Princeton writes, “X won’t stop COVID argument X.” Instead, it’s argument X along measures. Seat belts won’t prevent fatal car crashes, cars also come airbags crumple zones. “When layer things, give wiggle room,” Dean says.

Several experts I’ve talked asked: now? question assumes pandemic lingers U.S. simply hasn’t found right solution yet. fact, lingers familiar solutions never fully implemented. Despite claims White House, U.S. still testing enough people. still doesn’t enough contact tracers. “We playbook, think there’s confusion we’ve actually tried we’ve talked doing,” Dean says. successful response “is never going one thing done perfectly. It’ll lot different things done well enough.” resilience disappears create…

2.	False Dichotomies

A world black white easier handle one awash grays. false dichotomies dangerous. start, COVID-19 portrayed disease mostly causes mild symptoms people quickly recover, occasionally causes severe illness leads hospitalization death. two-sided caricature—severe mild, sick recovered—has erased thousands “long-haulers” endured months debilitating symptoms home neither recognition care.

Meanwhile, businesses closed stay-at-home orders rolled out, “we presumed trade-off saving lives saving economy,” says Danielle Allen, political scientist Harvard. “That foolishness profound degree.” two goals actually aligned: Epidemiologists economists largely agree economy cannot rebound pandemic still raging. treating two opposites, state leaders rushed reopen, leading barely contained virus surge anew. Everybody better clue Tegnell. long keep little bastards hair agree. Got married via zoom NYC. live someone got sick event throwing let alone died. Choosing get vaccinated think they’re referring here. Freedom choice. Donyou think everyone thinks extreme generalizations? worked medical billing know exactly hospitals make decisions. Stop naive fool, pure liability capacity issues. bet soon drop 2k cases per state open up. Thanks nothing, Trump &amp; imbeciles!  France UK us remember right, yes, botched beginning quite head start. Italy us, well Germany. But, honestly, overtake easily don’t act situation.

In seriousness though, relax think, realize vaccine isn’t going take immediate effect stop mitigation right off. Flu vaccine takes two weeks take full effect one person. It’s like said, it’s phase abrupt. black white, greyscale. year ago war vaping, calling epidemic LMAO Crazy think trump taken seriously urged people (especially cult followers) wear damn mask would probably situation 🙄 mountain dew.

&amp;#x200B;

'Mountain Dew Mouth' Destroying Appalachia's Teeth, Critics No, I’m talking testing... I’m talking people searching testing locations, symptoms, etc. couple weeks see results that. wastewater live search volume = shows cases going blowing within next 2-4 weeks there... don’t need positive tests show that.

Had find alternative ways see spikes going happen ahead time don’t think testing ability going keep pace people wanting/needing get tested starting sometime December. 10th December? January 1, 2021 part winter 2021. chance enough people vaccinated January 1, 2021 masks/distancing mandated. Trump’s favorite sandwich Fish Delight. actually see - never gonna forget seeing field hospital Central Park, navy hospital ship pulling pier 90. Never gonna forget hearing sirens basically nonstop outside window weeks. 7pm cheer. know people perished, fortunately one close that’s grace God. 

We also saw field hospital Comfort wound basically unused. saw overall hospitalization numbers actually never got particularly close projections. enough ventilators. worst experience United States far, perhaps entire world, still hospital system break strain. think ""rise up"" means, especially today's context? 

If dumbass read article see tried re-contextualize comments something voting governor. reelection two years... 

You dumb fuck, motherfucker. That’s really interesting. post article r/covid19 pose question there. It’s scientific subreddit concerning coronavirus.

Thats cherry picking, saying, “You still wear mask get vaccine” straight true. % cases think figure actually infected? got right. going hope anything hope support need keep going. Ideally without strike. could like situation upper management doesn’t believe pandemic actively spreads conspiracy theories. year already?

He work 4-6 weeks still refuses believe covid hoax. Kids want go schools. News 10. Early bird mimosa vaccine specials think honest answer everyone world racist/sexist/xenophobic, people go life without ever realizing it. interpreting wrong way, probably behave way realize either.

Uhh no. complete utter disaster India. lot family, died covid There's little chance turn true.

If virus circulating March 2019, pandemic would going full steam last summer. wasn't.  imagine 2% ppl kind accident perished. would require racing harnesses helmets cars literally airbags bumpers absorb shockwaves, mention automatic breathalyzer locks ignition. wonder many cases. Opening schools Poland - cases skyrocketing weeks, closing schools - cases start going weeks. many people died still die decision keep schools open. heartbreaking.

Remote learning can't worse kids trauma potentially killing teachers, parents grandparents. absolute tragedy, every one. think US ever hard lockdown. [Thanksgiving 2020 [The scourge Hygiene completely agree. talk restrictions fatal economy get continued see saw restrictions increased numbers large part due deniers wearing masks, attending large weddings etc.

I wish would wear frigging mask. Issue is: Pfizer's vaccine requires two doses cold storage keep Moderna's jab requires one dose stored normally.  Cool. Thanks. Alright, bring fatigue!! Everyone missed sarcasm, friend.

You probably need /s smoke decent amount weed, never been*that* high. news built market considering weaknesses trials results really mean terms broader economy Pfizer phase 3 trial includes 22,000 vaccinated individuals Moderna one 15,000. much smaller group number people ultimately receive vaccines, still pretty darn large amount people.

The companies claiming serious adverse events occurred participants. see still considered true trials completed results independently evaluated FDA published peer-reviewed journal kinds scientists doctors take look data. confident specific immunological risk factors could complicate vaccination safe you.

You also assured mRNA bizarre chemical, actually something body naturally makes mind-boggling amounts every second. normally copy body's DNA uses recipe make protein case using make COVID-19 virus' spike protein. Using mRNA vaccine new idea, mean necessarily unsafe, fact appears lot quality data suggests otherwise. already caught I'm unsure vaccine would help, perhaps AntiBody cocktail would, high price course.  sad stupid leaves keyboards. Ok. That’s kind thought seems strange still get “, thank explanation. here. Pre covid I'd run foremans office ask question sick, sick crew sick. call talk 10 feet apart. 

I used use handrails along sidewalks, restaurants ect never touch them. open public door I'll use bottom left hand door hoop figuring none one touches push door open I'll reach high push one else probably has. 

Probably wear mask anytime around someone sick wear one out. everyone survive away loved ones indefinitely.

Yes fucking can.  waiting someone come make sense that. incredibly competent thing do.

I'm huge Trudeau fan can't say I'm disappointed government handled this. feel pretty blessed here. probably CDC less afraid getting pushback political sources since election over. might even welcome attempt salvage black mark legacy. Faucci says FDA discussing emergency use approval December 10th meeting approved begin vaccinations late December. ""demoralizing messaging"", process works. much would love right thing, basically forced go out. told work home 2 days week less.

The current leader says everything fine.  number new guys people say.. ""he's gonna solve it"". stupid dishonest.

I believe lockdowns lies make people feel good. Social distancing fine possible.  I've read 6 ft even close enough. ... likely work anyway. 1 million ga raly for?

So, ""Patient 1"" infected way year ago.  societal benefits beers bar questionable.

As single dude lives alone, beg differ. Texas isn’t much like South would think. issued mask mandate early June, believe southern state so. governor reopened state early, didn’t hesitate roll back reopening cases started going up. Overall think state government handled situation well here. Besides El Paso smaller west Texas cities, Texas urban areas performing quite well right now. counties Texas spiking rural counties MUCH higher per capita rates cities across state. non-male

Honest question... democrat understand, race gender. people take certain stances seems alignment specific race gender (like 85% race/gender agrees), come say nothing race gender. race gender really something it?

I'm white. lot non-white people shared feeling certain groups white people behave certain way feel different us. always say nothing that. maybe racist thinking way. like (asian), latinos, black people... think thing behavior seeing, told (different backgrounds races) wrong interpreting wrong way.

Welp 700K Canadian snowbirds coming Key West I've heard 7 snowbird friends coming. mean Florida loss tourists over, getting busy. right thing. Screw haters. we'll picking pieces next year. Hey Travis county resident drives Williamson often want I'm glad guys voted sheriff chode! tiers organized differently, grouped high risk individuals. That's still lot vaccines go around. still needs CDC approval grant vaccines. fighting rest country (and world) vaccines. going awhile. I'm saying get reprioritize you--i think need reasonable expectations. like comparing apples oranges dude, bit reach. civilized stuff, supposed happen 2020 remember? Next, you’re going try sell oceanfront property Kansas. Hi everyone. got test result back Sunday Covid positive. symptom things smell funny, diet coke tastes like Dr. Pepper, slight occasional cough. feel bad all. happen gym rat works 3-4 days week. continue exercise now, since literally nothing else do? low one time cost $15,000.

Oh need booster every year. 2000! county city level? state says job, could local government step-up? believe Florida allows recall elections local government officials want act even pretend try. U.S. already conservative amount 15-20 million disease.

15/300 = 5% population

So arent starting 0 either. 100% bet happen, baseball softball happening PA summer vaccine, wrestling still full swing. would agree certain industries somewhat locked down. even areas staff come interact things like prepare deliveries. still greatly impacting spread.


Furthermore long list non essential essentials negates lockdown. well lack enforcement. time area shelter place working two jobs. One fashion industry. never stopped coming work. worked multiple production facilities three cities, two ""locked down"". production slowed due facilities producing masks, never stopped fulfilling production requests. 

While job policy ""put mask client came pick something meeting"". often still maskless staff. lot production facilities us ship things managers personal address, look like getting shipments warehouses. unethical sham three separate cities. different state. lockdowns never truly locked down. Let's take reverse psychology approach tell can't want *want* it. Masks sick great idea. us though mandated everybody Unionize instead. normal month. state never locked currently everything back open. real difference masks school kids 4 days instead 5. tiny population like Australia lot things would work

Population matters less actions, population mattered North/South Dakota (pop 762k/884k) would far less trouble SA (pop 1.767m)... seem case. like, governments lies shutting work! reason close parks!

Racist, denial, etc. know. posted article cheer everyone causing controversy.  Oh heck no. can't let use bank machine, bathroom ""just sit minute"".

State business, GTFO. Type1 Diabetic here, one needle I'm looking forward Still proof anything you’re saying. Waiting facts Testing doesnt matter know 95% population cant get virus. Oxford vaccine also already mass produced, assuming eventual approval it’s ready distribution. That's depth. Generally speaking, yes good. However, something health well something serious COVID, unsure precisely. need balance speed versus risk here, never 100% sure something, 99.9%, 99%, 95% good enough? 70% good enough rolled tomorrow? issue, study, increase number variables controlling for, need increase number samples taken well. would imagine medical field, going much, much age/sex/race. agree. Imagine trying play sports virtual... Hell, concerts pandemic (albeit drive-in ones.) takes long Modify DNA, Also reason need keep cold.

[This release contains forward-looking information Pfizer’s efforts combat COVID-19, collaboration BioNTech Pfizer develop potential COVID-19 vaccine, BNT162 mRNA vaccine program, modRNA candidate scientist figured 1.5 years ago looking combat let get Magneto Nightcrawler.

MMR also took lot time develop.

I vaccines, idea pushing within year ethical major standard ever. “Why yes company losing millions millions dollar every day it’s cuz they’re it.”

This person clearly clue corporations work. Can't ""great"" nation world saviour #1. That’s love sub , fucking drama , lockdown DIE . 🤣

Yeah don’t want end floor bleeding orifices 😂😂😂 Yes, is. 12.5 Pfizer doses US year, assuming FDA approval. 16.5% US 65, approximate population 54 million. first doses likely go frontline workers year. Government officials estimating likely enough March/April general vaccination. think us much hygienic daily habits rest lives.

Also know great grandparents wash hands came dinner table.  still notable despite colder climate cooler winter weather. Island states faired better pandemic however face greater threats global heating. Interestingly heat bakes Australia small outbreak strain very, short incubation period. wonder correlation number strains emerging temperature. Yes have. point? health officials? certainly ain’t tRump’s plan. wants hold vaccinations hostage. ask Cuomo. ...are STILL conversation trying convince people it’s increased testing middle NOVEMBER 150k+ cases every day ??? We’re still this?? 

Throw whole damn country away. People dying hospital refusing admit Covid it’s hoax. Inmates paid $2 hour move bodies El Paso. People still flu comparisons “it’s testing” rambling. quarter million dead approaching REALLY bad part. 

we’re turbo-fucked. survivable rate, shutdown wholeworld. Unless coming another country, think quarantined forcibly without proof sick (ie positive test). am, person exposed infected person asked quarantine. Family members exposed person required quarantine unless directly exposed person starts showing symptoms. 

Is enforced law enforcement? area really. Sure let’s skip animal trials bunch FDA regulations! Good luck that! It’s hard carrying much hate honestly tiring read might take around 10 days. approved, US government said want shots arms within 24 hours. half country shut suddenly march like dominoes felt like....how many deaths think would right now? anyone remember article super smart infectious diesease virologist something asian-american lady worked gym owner make better circulation gym prevented outbreak? 1. majority variations completely safe
2. specify time vaccination side effects. Like said, majority side effects experienced shortly vaccination, extremely rare vaccines experience problems long time vaccination.



""Incidence rate study data show rise rate narcolepsy following vaccination except one signaling country included (Sweden, used Pandemrix)"" said, relevant _this discussion_. concern people raised trial speed ""long term side effects"".

Yes, mistakes happen, somehow mix Polio COVID vaccine nothing trial run. 

I seen nothing suggest vaccine increased risk manufacturing defects compared medicine kind, (and don't) think relevant discussion whether vaccine safe. Congrats degree, man, that's awesome. Next holiday season isn’t going suck regardless. We’re well track herd immunity well see vaccine rate. lives realistically saved. Spend time immediate family, it’s rough fucking year. year we’ll place regardless. Yeah agree, think may-June things fall mass events promise promise states even get vaccine equal 10% state population. never lockdown, request stay home, business closed, employees took unpaid vacations. 9 months kick can, so, blame ineptitude someone else. follwed protocols since day 1 lucked out, probably okay, way much disinfomation blatant erroneous conjecture. joke. Honestly wouldn’t believe number driving around able see shit too. People drive barely able make big E top chart. It’s horrifying. yeah, seeing thinking every day years I’m pretty numb crippling fear people road point. Okay, that's choice make. make choice keep wearing masks, social distancing, avoiding crowded indoor gatherings. continue people vaccinated irresponsible. thanks info first responders (including guard) probably first. important persons like govenors shit close second. imagine gradual (but still fairly fast) mass rollout usually end changing mask halfway shift clean one available. provide disposable ones onsite well don’t like using it’s wasteful masks. Even they’re bit smelly. 

One thing like buy gum, put pocket mask I’m wearing wear mask smells like gum hour two. employers... One call center thankfully longer work write calling sick. matter actually sick not, doctor's notes help. bastards always writing people firing many absences.

Yep. Lots people close quarters, number colds (this COVID) &amp; flu - accepted practice tough come work could drag bed all. COVID hit, county order shut lockdown order given - still dragging feet, even employers switching work-from-home. Clicked wrong link, thought KY one posted time CDC: Since administration it’s way out, decided present facts instead Alternative Truths we’ve relied misinform public expense economy. 

Or something. Kentucky. tested. confirm 100% true.   wonder COVID utilize global effort medical issues. Like cancer, dime time whatever fuck else. 

Have ever seen progress like this?  Lmao can’t stay home, please wear mask social distance. get tested early days drive thru testing university hospital. looked like early scene zombie movie CDC thought could contain it. ""If everyone dies, planet might still time recover virus humankind."" -New scientific information one item long list unfortunate, unforeseen consequences reaction pandemic. Nobody knows certain question heavily politicized. blame ""carefree summer"" - discos clubs open, travel within EU allowed, masks mandatory apart shops inside businesses - others believe due schools workplaces reopening Autumn - distancing masks mandatory now, big public transportation problem, always packed everyone wears masks correctly. Also workplaces pushed stop working home lot stuff generally badly organized, several government bodies keep passing blame onto other. Usual Italian mess lol.  think that. might supports office, beliefs, beliefs followers. think line *""Especially virus 99.8% survival rate""* sort shows intention money. people I've heard parrot side effects virus die-hard supporters certain party. can’t stay home, please wear mask social distance. Oops, completely missed Racist much? vast majority Amber Alerts involve abductions non-custodial parent. remind bot thingie?  can’t stay home, please wear mask social distance. Awaiting final effectiveness results SputnikV vaccine 😌 Thats ""back normal"". Restrictions restrictions. realise us island nations got essentially 0 followed government ordinance institute hard boarders within states cities right? 

EU countries never taking seriously, lockdowns don’t work. bloody well worked earlier year get numbers it’s surging again. Australia never stopped restrictions varying types, even relaxed restrictions WA QLD there’s still lot people can’t do, limits personal events. 

Island nations like us get shit control protect vulnerable populations here. immune outbreaks new Adelaide cluster precious NZ cluster shows. hugely different, actually take seriously I'm asking anything.

It's probabilities math.

The virus is. respect not. can’t stay home, please wear mask social distance. many illnesses could similar symptoms I'm saying. I'm trying dense, hope understand I'm saying.  argument vaccine may cause long term effects yet unknowable needs balanced logical observation COVID19 long term effects yet unknowable. Logically speaking, that's reason get vaccine, get COVID19 anyways sort long term effect? Okay cool, that's figured wanted make sure. Thanks! varies disease, we'll way know sure we've vaccine around while.

So far, appears participants maintained immunity, study run 8 months. Anything past guesswork.

That said, first-line defense I'm happy get booster every year while. need last winter, summer side world. reaction sub, article people think could wander around ICUs hospitals pandemic? 

Like might freedom movement, ward highly contagious disease would closed general public. like randos could walk Ebola wards. family lives rapidly spreading area country right wife really bad asthma, hope get dose gets it. taking account mild asymptomatic cases caught. Imagine distribution also based potential risk. It’s gonna go healthcare workers (Doctors, nurses, etc.) first along first responders. likely goes people grocery stores like. Probably months average person get one Nope! beginning. might want stop lying public. guy park dad know stock market intelligent guy going rna hope might damage take it. like know talking I'm trusting Google skills medical establishment here. Spoiler: almost states Red. study say that? thing one year flu shot. Whole arm sore hell, never happened since. Dangerous indeed Arts culture dead. Restaurants becoming thing past. traditions vilified. taken everything good humanity created past 5000 years ground dust people poor risk assessment abilities terrified virus that's perfectly harmless 99% people.

And fool think governments world give newfound power micromanage citizens' lives ""threat"" passed. Stop giving people excuses wear fucking mask

Are lost? They're simply studies mask wearing, what's wrong that? science works, study things actually work. Florida depends Tourism lot revenue. people locked spending state gets tax dollars. know, Biden 2020 voter mobilization like never before. Georgia. say anything like that. asked go outdoors Weds highest deaths backlogged, think expect average 25+ per day next week. They’ve really awesome whole thing honestly. Every month give us reusable washable masks, sanitizer stations everywhere people who’s job literally walk around make sure people distancing. would delegate team give summary. That's news organizations able report things like Panama papers fast.

Point job damn near 24/7 done. They're literally killing people stalling. Sounds like caught quite afternoon Acting Chief Medical Officer Paul Kelly's said ""There young doctor hospital northern Adelaide absolutely essential picking first case. family member went hospital went Emergency Department something else completely different, respiratory symptoms, one doctors heard person coughing test know there's something going South Australia early.""
It's scary think Doctor overhearing cough, might still know virus loose community.
Thank 'young doctor', owe beer over.""

It already spread lot people point undetected, could spread lot more. South Australia case community around 3 months, well doctor hear cough think ask test. Good news: fixed pipes u-trap something.

Most modern apartments these. think referring ""flu-like symptoms"" caused vaccine. ""flu symptoms"" actually caused immune system activating. Typical symptoms immune activity are:

- Achey bones muscles
- Fever
- Tiredness
- Redness near injection site

During ~2 weeks exposure virus, body begins producing antibodies new cells fight it. come bone marrow, causes ""achyness"". body also thinks really sick, might run fever swell area response; remember, fever swelling body's _defense_ infection, something infection you. Houston. shoot fireworks every holiday. even joking. job? Money. state can't afford people work buy stuff.

Florida's whole economy based people spending money. strain 24 hours. Thats lockdown soo short. Amazing comparison. Definitely gonna steal lol. One step closer slaying virus Man want shit DONE ALREADY :( plan again.?

Did try googling it? visit site? 

[Saved click big scary pandemic?

You won’t saying parents children get ot... aide 250,000 Americans already died it. You’re disservice sarcastic dismissal Covid caused pain deaths. 

Your obnoxiousness tells you’re trumpanzee. mod Arizona Rona sub (lol unfortunately missed opportunity name) it’s wild. love community damn can’t wait needed anymore. like leftovers  El Paso? helpless anything it? Yet still morons saying cold/flu.  People would rather die admit wrong.

I'm fierce independence, think spirit caused braindrain America people think right opinion gives credibility speak matters understand. 

And narcissism double faced evidence contrary. ""There's sciency stuff sides!"" Stop that!! That's misrepresenting reality.

You can't compare pandemic response nations insular culturally homogenous (China,Japan,Korea) intermingling diversity West,  mention differing geography boarders!

Anyone says:

## ""look, working remote islands, come US India Mexico can't get shit together.""

..Is combination willfully ignorant, low IQ, and/or deliberately trying push agenda, etc...  Contract tracing works small groups outbreaks. outbreak grows large enough number contacts grow geometrically. 5x5x5x5x5 like ... Contract tracing joke hasn’t really worked anywhere except arguably New Zealand. long though? Sometimes they're predominate strain vaccine. No-one's forced live company CEO. people would actively avoid anything odds 1 180 death. rationalization insanity. too. Kaiser they’ve covered anything COVID related far Yup. That's really insane i'll never understand thing. That's enough. Keep civil. California mandate says need masks outside 6 feet away told wife go Thanksgiving Christmas dinner family year pandemic. upset insists since family already tested positive longer concern visiting holidays. idea previously tested positive longer obligated socially isolate seem correct. someone clarify situation me? responsible overly concerned? Anybody wanna give TLDR? super curious super duper lazy. absolutely right. Cities like Seattle/Portland pretty decent mask usage rates cases still going up. enough people still go restaurants/bars/meet friends/etc. need masks thogher restrictionsm dude seen state borders? nothing there, would way controlling many roads conecting guys get yet? Shit never gonna go back normal corrupt government wants thing last forever, coronavirus second 9/11 basically farted?!?!? Maybe reset post-CO2 society dark winter over. put agenda '21 build back better. GET EM Dr Fauci!!!!!!
I know exactly happened speak freely glad finally happened. finished reading covert one book series. Man naive back then. world view, CDC, W.H.O, U.S.A.M.R.I.I.D going absolutely demolish virus, course, 2020, everything going awesome. expecting half world catch fire regress 100 years. even sub? never add anything substance value conversation. comments either rude racist. What, people real life sick bullshit else dump it? posting article likely source lot presence viable virus ensure infection figure given surfaces like glass stainless steel, know virus persists longer surface. expert processing methods, processed foods processed using automated methods, hand. Furthermore, processed foods cooked end user likely severely diminish number viable virus product. meant 12-18 months approval. Even low end that's pretty conservative estimate That's exactly happened now-ex (who Europe flown in) last December. insane mystery infection basically destroyed week, definitely unusual after-effects. 

Then got one, mine lasted four torturous months still residual effects today, six months cleared up. Doc said severe common cold bronchitis, area Covid tests yet.  Get cheap bidet. Stop wiping shit yourself. Would wipe shit hands? December 14th electors vote US election whole Trump pretending thing finally end. Governor Idaho: “we don’t need mask mandate!” 
*sends overflowing Covid patients WA, hospitals instead* something simple wearing mask still scoffed alarmingly high number people. Sadly, mask mandate change that; always holdouts.  call tougher restrictions? Lollllll  Nice name. know answer. wanted compliment username business meetings make money no, get cut all. could almost think federal govt EU bit power states countries bit less power. rules states follow(basic ones federal laws, constitution etc.) rules federal government make made states. pandemic response rule made federal government. give guidelines, states ones make laws certain. Confidence lost. I'm waiting vaccine + degree herd immunity. It’s stupid argument mate That’s interesting tech. Gotta say. Pretty cool. Sad practical wishful thinking. never ceases amaze me. Could tests processed home? That's novel part here. country ripe biological attack amazing.

How know covid that?

China far better simple masks lock behavior would solve.

Their economy Chinese people looking move away confident China ever.

Things going better China planned it. coronavirus survived I’m old, asthmatic, immunocompromised. . it, what’s people’s excuse? might best description 2020 yet  Free donate blood Since day 1. Everyone knows this. But... making fun idiots saying 99.9999 percent chance living real number everyone alive changing right decimal Covid? protests protesting lockdowns, protests spread virus BLM cause virus knows. That's nice! hope everyone becomes united end horrific chapter lives sooner :( Don’t blame Fauci it, told, blame higher ups kept seriousness COVID wraps months.  killing old weak. young healthy people dying. Nobody healthy dies it!   /s

Believe not, got comment morning. That’s like, opinion, man. pandemic. took 5 days mother's funeral. Besides that, worked 5 days week, every week. state needs shut can't without federal assistance. People continue die piece paper. should. I’m grateful everyone came helped us out, also left capacity table terms personnel. Example: friend 4th year med student. told stand by, ready get called big leagues started needing bodies. never wound utilized. *less* immune? You’re *more* immune unknown period afterwards. No?  don’t agree states rights important, least meaningful way. “I think freedom speech important government needs prevent it” 

The fact you’re advocating federal government needing able rule states, it’s lip service think states rights important. fine, that’s argument country since revolution. don’t disingenuous it. NYC here, thing people followed rules beginning bad. see social media friends house parties still going vacation states. know what, fair, like prisoners dilemma. world going end im gonna sucker stays everyone else wild end world party. Sturgis Motorcycle thing   really oz smarter that. NJ nyc suffered bulk deaths beginning didn’t testing people didn’t understand. mention super dense. ND almost 8 months get ready. nothing result. Horrible. comparing apples oranges northshore! local government shit handling virus. hope receive influx people small parades. Communism!!! Oh, perhaps, good idea might save US... Yup, least things slowly start get better.. slowly.. wear job work near industrial fryers, 300°F friendly trying breathe 5 area. yeah hate lol. Fingers crossed....

Mine went window January realized going much immediately started lying public. Literally zero confidence - completely altered life work prepare this. mean, wouldn’t knew leaders playing games, honest, focused politics economy lives? honestly believe second stimulus check.

Turkey grandmas mashed taters lalalalal la la la cannonball run? :( average person attention span s.....ooooh, shiny!  Ouu that's really smart, thank I'll look them! In-person teachers higher risk simply fact they’re around vectors could otherwise avoid working home. FDA said asked vaccines advisory committee plan meet Dec. 8-10 discuss Covid-19 vaccines.


The meetings could discuss applications Pfizer-BioNTech Moderna.



The regulator expected decide quickly vaccines meetings group, known as VRBPAC, Vaccines Related Biological Products Advisory Committee. vaccine stop getting infected? cool context - thanks info! Immunity shown last months typical coronaviruses, ones caught still need vaccine remain immune MEAN FEMA CAMPS??!!!1 may popular electorally popular, factoring political power rural voter vs urban. voter Wyoming 67x times political power voter California. ally stock investment Moderna quick math, 40 case fatality rate something like 0.2%. assuming would live average age 80 that's 40 years stepping outside house 1000 times per year. get chance death covid would 1/20,000,000. include fact people higher/lower risk know ahead time healthy person would already know risk even lower. glad folks like still helping public Tbh already considering wearing mask crowded areas flu season went down, I’m probably going that. 

Pandemic pandemic, year confirmed belief small reduction giving receiving viruses good thing. hope sake! tell wear mask you? wondering 95% effective rate could skewed mask wearing.   Yes. two leading causes cancer heart disease. dont stop exponential growth there's chance could pass those.  watch scalp citizens it. God bless American death cult. good enough, especially American presidents Yup fully believe got real thing relieved news effectiveness. still taking precautions feel like least breath sigh relief. Precisely. remarkable quickly we've gotten multiple vaccines look effective. science technology advanced much waiting years years (or decades) watching even people die. great news. really doesn’t go everything heard immunity. Let ask you, think vaccines/post infection immunity works? It’s like creates force field around virus never enters body. primes body deal pathogen swiftly effectively get sick. do, it’s milder case. 

I want clear, chances passing virus someone developed immunity definitely lower! don’t know much yet every pathogen little different. want disabuse folks notion recovered Covid vaccinated means pose risk others. Yeah, mRNA cancer treatment BioNTech‘s specialty, pivoted Covid. Presumably they’ll go back cancer vaccine done. noooooo way saying anything PARTICULAR COVID VACCINE 

But you’re right. horrible birth deformities stuff “safe” things. Things happen.

We learn follow brains less hearts comes world. hearts brains comes personal lives. 
And balance

I don’t know anything Iol. much left learn! mention “Reports say”?

No need equivocation.

Bizarre! One cancel Dolly Parton recommendations try move prominence. clearer risk hierarchy might help. annoys people say calculated risk risky scenarios expressing terror less dangerous situation. example, grocery stores random less likely infection probability cluster outbreaks prolonged, home contact non-household members. reason people seem get this. Random people internet randomly came across check feedback covid vaccine news 90% telling shit 10 saying it’s real vaccine side effects. dont look media (cnn bbc such) something u 100% trust due past incidents. dont background people cuz random. asked question “parroting deliberate disinformation” wanted know others opinion. Hopefully u understand reminder:

1) 95% effective still make immune. still need practice social distancing, mask wearing, hand washing, etc. virus longer threat.

2) Consider taken round-the-clock testing nine months reach half US population, expect vaccine deployed faster. 

While excellent news, people still danger least another year, especially people color people living places access vaccine poor. 

Let's let guard down. fight far over, even vaccine. saw pictures people line stock grocery store. half wearing masks.  bias, discrimination, politics.

Yeah ok buddy. think last Easter could last Easter thanksgiving could last Thanksgiving, etc. &amp; spent alone you’re old covid isn’t kill you

I think sometimes too. grandfather 93 years old skin cancer. got diagnosed thumb surgery testing thumb. refused tests (and treatment) determine far long because... well, he's 93.

But means really idea long has. So, I'm staying away protect him, there's also chance may never see regardless.

Just sucks around. Gotcha, nothing bad bad happens? doubt rent Coca Cola trucks. mean that, like 90% sample infected d2 d27, would counted results?

Infections control group would also counted time frame. point 28+ days innoculation, 162 people received placebo got infected 8 received actual vaccine got infected time frame. That's fair comparison. Conferences best IMO. year go big nationwide conference industry, treat vacation lmao Wow, optimistic them... herd immunity protects anyone *doesn’t* get virus, need vaccine? Absolutely!

**Sources**

For starters, given current environment try avoid misinformation sticking three primary sets sources:

* official FDA/CDC/EMA releases
* medical journals ([Google great go-to source)
* legal documents court reports

They're sorts documents hard fake provenance of, lots copies independent locations. Make sure include sources, statement seems fishy check source—indicated superscript number like this^(1)—and source says claim.

If can't find one sources back something up, make sure source something hard fake. Track down, make sure source reputable heard matches say.

Also news sources great *starting point* tend scientifically illiterate prone sensationalism. example, H1N1 vaccine mentioned oft described ""very high"" incidences mortality. That's quote paper, context ""very high"" means 0.0040% vs. 0.0015%. Rather trust say, use terms authors starting points search Google Scholar.

**Citations Authors**

Next, check citations authors. often paper cited? good paper reliable information, see cited dozens times source like Google Scholar, even year two old. also worth cursory glance citations: refuting paper, referencing it?

Last, check authors. scientific paper, generally want looking **First Last author**. first author postgrad researcher lead study. last author advisor oversaw study signed it. Make sure last author particular long, relevant career reason bias.

^(1)*...and accompanying footnote listing source*

PS. I'm sorry hear side effects Accutane. sucks, hope okay. understand makes skeptical, dig different mechanisms play. think reassured differently something like accutane works vs. new vaccines. SARS MERS vaccine ever shipped there’s nothing look here. One SARS vaccine candidate *did* problematic effects animal trial (antibody dependent enhancement mice).

Nothing like seen SARS-2 vaccine candidates. like 70 million... going it, nice. I’d like see least test participants Covid month. testing people report symptoms. I’m worried people get vaccinated protection developing illness long enough become superspreaders. Well yeah, welcome February everybody.  there’s long term testing I’m going pass colleges might say ""if want wear mask, show proof covid vaccine admissions"" vaccines mRNA based? them? underlying process mechanics totally new.

(SOURCE: US government paid 100 million doses Moderna Pfizer each, there's expected 70 million doses pfizer Moderna combined end year, that's split worldwide. 30-35% US population tier 3, unfortunately going take awhile teachers vaccinated. I'm expecting lot anger process next year. wife RN dealing COVID positive patients daily basis, terrified vaccine rushed. says take unless forced to, least information available. mean, sure.....everyone started working vaccine ASAP, history told expect one quickly, even work going on. think point vaccine completely novel unknown virus space year, that's pretty remarkable. took quite lot longer LOTS different viruses. Science come long way since people catching diptheria measles polio time. Still haven’t provided proof one thing. Claim claim proof  really hope prioritize healthcare workers emergency responders distribution. dad supervises testing site fiance started externship MA. dad told networks work receiving vaccines administering frontline workers within next 2 months everything continues successful we're seeing now. relieving news. 
 
For ""Open state!"" Anti-maskers...fuck you. crowd, world favor wear goddamn mask couple months get damn vaccine available you. sooner everyone gets onboard, sooner finally get back normal. government control, respecting everyone, especially lost live fighting front lines invalids like all. credentials? arrive 95%? people trial allowed go business ones got infected virus 5%? wear mask living highly masked area? wondering made difference. also pointed study above. looked much mask protected wearers much protected others infected wearers. reality, really paint good picture situation everyone wears mask.  lot offices disappear, too. Working home already started get popular...COVID accelerated it.

The downside: Commercial real estate, along support businesses around office buildings: restaurants, coffee shops, gyms, etc. We’ve mandates restrictions place since spring, cases started spike again. really makes wonder whether wasted time measures first place, infection seasonal like cold flus slight uptick cold weather enough bring back.

I’m starting feel hopeless make real attempt mitigate disease without vaccine. differences deaths Scandinavian countries attributed lot things. Management elderly care; example rate change personnel elderly homes. Cultural differences population; early data Sweden’s Public Health Agency confirmed Somali Swedes made almost 5 percent country’s COVID-19 cases, yet represented less 1 percent 10 million people. Sweden immigrants neighbors.


Sweden got hit hard early, contrast neighbors. timing spread Europe Alp ski resorts bad. lot Swedes travel Alps weeks 7 - 9 (late February). Norwegians need Alps ski, Danes ski first place. Swedes brought coronavirus back Sweden returned.

Will interesting see future studies show spread effect different locations. people still get sick get exposed lot it. might take people don’t like, even someone gets covid something shouldn’t doing, don’t think ridiculed “got deserved.” articles random covid deniers got sick died comments chortling never sat right me.  Well, remember everyone trustworthy said would take year minimum roll vaccine. That’s start, finish available everyone. that’s we’re looking at, probably bit time it’s available everyone. think vaccine backed Trump election scary idea.
I don’t see you’d arbitrarily decide extra year. It’s Fauci approved.
And r/askscience there’s thread talk incredibly rare long term effects vaccines are. almost doesn’t ever happen. know long term effects COVID.  nuts. feel pain, job went full remote late February, nothing home home year.

I'm also happy relatives work healthcare safer even sooner will.


There light end tunnel! like skeptical criticism towards information see hear. bias, discrimination, politics. 
Look, hope well. 
I hope people get safe vaccine.
And think possible one it.

Omer, director Yale Institute Global Health, said results showing vaccines protected people severe disease also good news, limited availability initially, first goal stop transmission disease, prevent people becoming extremely ill. 

This fact tested 22,000 people unknown medical history (pfizer released data press conference saying reached 95% efficacy) US 30% racially ethnically background. 

Also mRNA vaccines whole may deadly people like wife abnormal autoimmune responses. vaccines future much still infancy age development long term data type vaccines affect people. 

So yes risk family high get vaccine vs social distancing proper precautions. 2% vs unknown danger would take person love life line? 2% number county 32k cases 1.6 million people. said ""at least 90%"" Yes, administer millions doses. usual vaccination clinics usually cooling facilities. even shipping around, labs cooling facilities typically deal volume. logistics huge challenge. 

And think less developed countries like India. India backwater, doubt capacity keeping millions millions doses cooled. vaccinate entire population within year they'll need administer roughly 10 million doses per day, none doses -70°C cooling chain five days. Reports talk multiple years extrapolating disease (MERS SARS), disease existed multiple years yet. quite know long immunity lasts, average minimum, fully understand relationship antibody test result immunity either. suggestions vaccine lasts longer natural immunity we'll see. Also, side effects sound quite minimal, that's much reason.

Wait local authorities say - recommend vaccine even previous infection, probably go it. math also? think article written bot googling [I found powerpoint really Thanks daily dose cynicism /s sure? still spreading Mumps, Rubella, etc. different biologically?

If true, that’s really disappointing hear. exactly going turn away paying customers government forcing to? stream every class people watch home feeling ill TA dedicated answering questions slack channel.

No reason come class really. loaded question really upvoted? reasonable guess ""some"" counted COVID deaths overcounted. seems inevitable mistakes made talking many deaths.

But implying ""tens thousands"" New Yorker death overcounted (to counterbalance excess mortality deaths). That's big number mistakes! I'd prefer see *direct* evidence accepting stress pandemic increased number stress-related deaths, cases, cancelled operations procedures direct ""COVID deaths"" 

Agreed! said, probably indirect deaths (mixed direct deaths, unknown ratio).

Excess mortality seems like important statistic me, personally. death statistically avoidable, take much comfort death ""only"" caused health care system undermined virus, rather virus directly. Another option could poor man's liquid nitrogen.

Which pretty much rubbing alcohol chilled dry ice anti vaccine guy upvoted sure got New American Century we! Well Ski country to, rich People find fancier Ski alps Nice. wonder infected already still need vaccine? people vaccine study let know afterwards received vaccine certain? Anti vax sentiment pretty widespread Europe too. I'm going less-than-pleasant weeks surgery, count prepared needled anywhere way necessary. I'm inpatient RN maternity leave ends January. mine newborns sake (and obviously lovely husband would definitely get got it), hope vaccine rolled us soon! I’m saying people *choose* wear one..as many cold..I feel like imaging forced wear one?? may, perfect data, think reasonable deduce Sweden closer culturally, politically geographically France Denmark. can't compare Sweden locked Sweden locked down, look done well compared similar countries.

Your point ski resorts exactly Sweden closed down. management virus care homes. things countries locked heavily avoid. works 95% risk orher 5% get minimal. I’m glad you’re taking sensible precautions despite holiday period. Must frustrating can’t spend together need think people come contact daily. 

I get tested July potentially may infected 4 flatmates due client testing positive. Luckily came back negative. guilt waiting results driving insane don’t understand people like daughter husband free it. 

I’ve seen UK relax social distancing rules Christmas. guess covid19 going take holiday 24-25th /s right wing Supreme Court cares pleasing corporate overlords. even abortion social issues. rare instance, corporate overlords want ( $$$$) people want ( immunization) agreement. anything, court would make harder exemptions. would also think point would antibodies good thing. Theoretically got reinfected would would less sick overall helping population reach herd immunity levels covid cases become scarce. may paranoid, vaccine that’s tested even year sketchy, right?! know there’s long term side effects..? personally wanting vaccine doesn’t make antivax way. It’s people can’t grasp it, it’s it’s bullshit nine months end sight people starting roll dice fuck it. I’m condoning gatherings course people getting antsy. I’m gonna many drugs fornicate many women 😂 Wow, sad....  AGAIN!!!! Lol. like Sweden different. Good trying something different. shows instead starving alone wilderness, modern society allows daft addle fully participate.

We call Progress. grocery store chain mid-Atlantic region apologizing unfortunate blunder Thanksgiving advertisement printed latest edition magazine.

“Hosting? Plan super spread,” reads full-page ad seen [December Giant Food's magazine, Savory. 

oops SMALL BUSINESS QUESTION:

I've looking google find answer, I'm coming here. data available much small businesses contribute covid spread/ type small businesses riskier spread it? 

It appears small businesses getting lot blame, also impacted greatest. research regarding closing small businesses really effective strategy? maybe fall blood pressure? doctor random guess No, actually said. said everyone would perceive delivered food necessity apartment living, since indeed people live apartments rely upon it. notion living studio apartment = requiring takeout would obvious me. think variety professions situations would helpful sure.  Yeah. Without COVID, lot old people would probably couple (or five, ten) years enjoy grandkids.

You gotta go point, COVID sounds like pretty miserable way go.  last Thanksgiving spent family origin ended mom shouting whole trip waste time, money, vacation, gas, etc, probably sort family sees funerals, preferably hers.

So, count ""holidays full drama year's lack expectations nice"" camp. really sucks reading things like this. I'm 32 I've blessed greatest parents anyone could ask for. They're caring, loving, worked assess children. Scomo going suppression since day 1

Nz one going elimination I’m one 6 people wearing mask company 200+ people don’t understand it’s protect others 🤦‍♂️ Yes issue sick, wouldn’t cost anything. Also sick people don’t really feel like going around much anyway.  Hospitals California okay? ones? access data hospitals cal... number covid patients patient icu. one part cal either. Imperial county hard hit yes going. Please share real data. don’t look local pic...but thanks assumptions. cal done better cal. number counties Cali 0 1 patient hospital covid. Genuine question, want understand : managed get vaccine effective, completely reliable test? deploy fix can't locate bug? way. thats everyone scientists said Covid-19 could get China

i still remember disbelief idea lockdowns yet Right. Everyone excited safety checks

Uhhh really since there's way they've done long term effects tests yet. Vaccines normally tested almost 4 years declared safe. saying, get Legend. many people understand that. think there's easier ways microchip everybody.

I'd routine dental procedures. Thank everything deal right now. Truly can’t imagine exhausting must way.  Huh?

You're talking periods include highest single day total ever reported Sweden (yes know... testing yada yada), claiming periods represent leveling off?

Well, we'll see time next week. Looking PA 5th populated state ranked **17th** total tests conducted? Needs thread own. Nothing life is, absolute doorknob. already really interesting back look posts january/february Whoever could seen coming? guys remember outside? people? crazy things.  H.G wells Time Machine? mean could explain we’re worst point pandemic since started. Surges every state, hospitals capacity, death toll climbing. Americans used getting everything want right away. small sacrifice much ask it? mean people why’re sick smog bad big cities , especially Asian countries. It’s big deal Oh true, could review approve 2 3 vaccines time, that's probably efficient. They’re dying infecting others along way. That’s f great  sure, surely source saying so? antibody tests insanely high false negative rates doubt it. 

Not mention really sound like expert medical trials conducted That's _reported_ yesterday, actual hospitalizations yesterday.

See November, 2265 reported hospitalizations. 2265/17 = ~133

November deaths: 62

November cases: 80,133

November IFR: .000007% close contact also lead infection. think killing 16 million mink Netherlands? people eat them?  get lot lot saying I’ve already seen Facebook posts local groups saying won’t get vaccine cHaNGeS DnA!!! Americans embracing denialism I'd imagine better pay working hours would benefit banging hands together. understand completely think risk low hunker again, already wear mask social distance mean risk assessment point personally assess risk low enough fine considering nature activities I'm partaking in. also think taking another whole year done moreso 6-7 months that's another argument Probably discuss vaccines time, stupid ask me. Freshly released today:
The first RCT mask wearing yet seen Covid-19 done general between-group difference −0.3 percentage. authors describe “not statistically significant” 🇸🇪 ♥ 🥝 real vaccine friends made along way :) earlier results. based cases even smaller percent cases came vaccinated people. available here. kids babies, medical care military facility. immunization clinic would literally make sit read vaccine's leaflet would give kid shots. include *how* vaccine worked public aware common less common side effects vaccines would improvement.

I used friend turned antivax kids, swears neighbor's kid got measles measles vaccine. Every vaccine proven time again. one literally impossible know long term effects. find weird amazed people wanting know effects they're putting body. Yes. KN95s KF94s available needed healthcare. Anyone handle masks correctly maintain proper hand hygiene distancing never taking around people (no eating others break room) use them.

I'm able things, gotten even mild cold since March. Use non-covid viruses test whether things right. still getting sick anything all, probably something wrong. Like Belgium ! dont think know better them. Im saying Id rather wait 2nd gen vaccine. like dont safer effective vaccine. believe everyone gets inoculated, go back normal economy continue we'd left year ago -- atleast several months reinfection starts showing up. 

A person trial sat phone night, ready call 911, cause felt hes pass sec. getting 2nd dose. end, would cost hundred dollars ambulance. trial app asked ever go hospital due complication. replied ""No"" record, says severe adverse effect needs medical attention reality, probably have. specialist, what's take safety vaccine?

I've read much vaccines ever life year, including many statements vaccines usually take many years testing monitoring deemed safe use. concerned taking vaccine developed year using relatively new method (mRNA, really understand anyway)

I've considered fact disinformation prevalant anti-vaxxers everywhere, may swayed subversive psy-ops shit afraid take vaccine be.

But swine flu vaccine paralyzed lot people around 90 days took it. concern effects vaccine years line? know anybody who's *from* there, several went work Minot AFB oil-boom town. (And left.) told snirt. safety checks

Uhhh really since there's way they've done long term effects tests yet. Vaccines normally tested almost 4 years declared safe. saying, get **I Legend**. It’s 5 days. you? ty james ur mask unclear between:

1.) less severe

and

2.) exactly same.

I pass everytime. thought bother me. really care. body shuts bit stupid reason.

I good laugh wife. Pepperidge Farms Remembers. 

It strange though. Like started actually worked god awful office building day. I’ve gotta say don’t actually want go back that. god miss drinking bars, going real dates wife, museums. God miss museums. outdated all, Pentagon focusing China near peer adversaries now.

They changing army battalions useful large scale war instead independent units everything need conduct operations Afghanistan irregular forces example. politician pretending something, look good gullible people actually accomplishing nothing. politicians good it. like person always shuffling papers around work saying busy accomplishing anything except case people dying paper cuts. China cases, rest East Asia also, reality every country East Asia, regardless goverment, far lower case load US / Europe.

We know virus already spreading Italy last September, combine obvious case load differences, beyond obvious that, even without harsh lockdown, China would fewer cases, simply they, rest Asia, tested responded early outbreak, whereas US Europe choose instead hide cases behind self selecting traveler-only testing criteria late. Well fucking shit Police never issue mandate.

For first time American history, 2020, police overwhelmingly showed support one candidate election.

Guess was. finished dreadfleet campaign. Boy love stacks necrofex colossus, deck gunners, gunnery mob bombers mindlessly raiding coasts. Can’t wait new dlc completely RKI reports. noticed BNO Worldometers started deviating quite bit RKI awhile back cases/deaths rose, gap noticeable. I'm sure why, 'deadliest day since pandemic began' headline sure earns clicks.

And BNO start, father passed away, people idea COVID. first time United States used state emergencies benefit people. perfectly valid solution need stop pretending not. Let's slowly die species restrictions  used push heavy weights.  
Turns finding common serious congenital heart defect doesn’t mix well that. 
If like it, stay safe enjoy. 
You may surprised much get body weight stuff though. 
Reddit great sub dedicated it. I'm saying thing would get banned. read dog owners higher COVID rates. imagine dogs sniffing others' excrement mode transmission, dogs capable becoming carriers (though perhaps subject becoming systemically infected). Could dogs one ""unknown"" vectors transmission. I'm sure social distancers still take dogs daily walks.  Wait seriously think COVID 3% death rate? Yikes Pfizer $29 doses Less gooo!!!! Most*. loses protective function, not, worse you... recommend backup mask hike outside summer.  incest states 5ucking up. That's shit like see.

I'll make point shopping there. Governors: *shrug* don’t assign vaccine distribution CD Projekt Red.  honestly get it. Halloween rolled around everyone insisted taking part. comes Thanks Giving everyone insisting taking part. WTAF people? People dying daily rate 1300+/-. people refuse wear masks get COVID-19 get absolutely zero empathy me. Eat bag dicks choke gasp last breath air lungs fill body fluids drown hubris. Get fucked. 

The people feel empathy, times, rage innocent people. children young people stuck households parental units shit brains refuse protect family. Well, vaccines 90+% effective, even 4/10 refuse take it, given already infected, still reach close 60-70% needed herd immunity. think anyone forced take it.  Yeah, March 5 googling things trip planning take France July, came across something internet caught attention *finally* made realize coming. hundred thousand cases worldwide point.

I seeking information Covid every single day since March 5. Except days July went hid woods escape. And? son's school open 2 1/2 months cases. small class sizes, masks required, good ventilation. on-campus testing every 2 weeks students, staff, family. 

Are sure actually spread school people meeting outside school lax then? really do. I'm DFW saw hospital census numbers fucking terrifying.

Meanwhile even ton liberal friends planning Thanksgiving parties going group gatherings. wear masks time, still. next weeks going be...interesting.

I need surgery Dec - ""elective,"" cost $3000+ deductible resets fucking painful wait - terrified. So, new new technology .. wow wow wow...  Mississippians “write off” deaths older comorbidities, Dobbs said. rebuking __common refrain__ among downplay pandemic’s severity __claiming people die virus would likely died soon age illness anyway.__

I tired, saddened enraged flawed, cruel narrative. aware got death penalty Cincinnati, Ohio resident. confirm isn’t fucking happening. in, people listen.

My wife RN last week hospital went 62 covid positive pt’s 167. Even followed enforced, aint fucking way would help.

Perhaps it’s foot-in-the-door kind thing? Prepare people sanctions road?  knew still refused sell stocks february, saw trump's conference loaded puts sold stocks cause knew gonna fuck did, x3 money remember first hearing around late December/early January.

Lots people thought gonna come go. go 70 year old parents though. put risk. Going risk. seeing doctor risk. Risk reward life decisions made. You’re big boy admitted icu within 24 hours. don’t admit icu funsies. Probably moved hospital time 12 hours (max). You’re wrong country buddy, sad may sound people, that’s reality living free country without limits.  Remember one time Rome declared state emergency became dictatorship didnt end everyone stabbed Caesar? Seconding this. Someone family July wedding year kind bummer really fun. Lots people left early general sentiment wished they'd postponed it. really want memory people have.

Also, alcohol starts flowing, masks fly off. impossible keep people distanced one another even big venue. Everyone agrees except idiot POTUS. don’t think Americans understand finite resources medical community. don’t infinite number staff hospital beds. limited ventilators. wear mask social distance! got lucky nature rolled dice got virus lethal something would see movies like 12 Monkeys books like Stand.  
The next one may lucky. truly bizarre. There's way _won't_ orange soon. Look criteria online. mayor Oswego news evening said absolutely certain they'll yellow within coming days. Ahh yes way humanity. Marter life death extra dollars. rest US match WI’s pace, break 5k deaths per day ""We may never get vaccine"" crowd basically dead (fuck articles, seriously) walked outside given 250 dollar ticket wearing mask, really think one would change mind? TIL ~3% death rate *directly COVID infection even counting post-COVID like Herrman Cain* actually 0.01%.

Yeehawdists funny. epidemiologist default clue done prevent pandemic. 

In addition present another article works argument, Dr Fauci ""lied."" Post reported ""mistakes"" White House accused Fauci included downplaying possibility asymptomatic spread. response, however, Fauci said experts operating based limited information nature disease fast-moving trajectory outbreak US, saying, **""our knowledge changed realization state outbreak changed.""**

I want present argument Dr Fauci purposely lied American people President, anything two articles presented justifies Dr Fauci actions, know, epidemiologist either. 

Simply saying Dr Fauci ""lied"" seems like petty argument compared prove Dr Fauci mislead nation recommendations


If think Dr Fauci lied masks wanted protect hospitals  ""lie"" given circumstances ground information available time, article states, lacking information, need better proof. US lot things rarely ever solves problems. death tally clear message many citizens die still business usual one year really happy pretty distant extended family. election Covid happily stay home (with Mom) enjoy holidays safely Trump offended deeply wounded he’s rejected American people he’ll double mismanagement create even chaos death. He’s narcissist. do. Straight playbook. doesn’t care much death leaves wake. opinion, deserve rejecting him. Yes, periodicity regulations work, crisis put regulations. Years crisis ended, people start criticizing taking regulations, another crisis shows up. many skeptics going around taking bevause dont ""trust"" 
 
Ill first line younger people get access it, cant understand people willingly make vulnerable disease 70s supergroup aerosmith great record 1982 yet new mtv generation preferred men without hats. Go figure think little behind narrative babe, Thanksgiving cancelled anyways. Link? Absolutely. Airfares cheap general public business travel. Companies pay outrageous prices comfort travel that's airlines make profits. I'm CNY. orange *days* ago. Comparing April numbers is... Horrifying. think depends. Meetings take hours might done online/remote. meetings duration would done remotely anyway right?

But experience, increasingly frustrating attend full day workshop/events online. big ask expect people pay level attention online, person. Seriously wow

I first googled something coronavirus think Jan 30. way think would something would affect life like this. lives.

It March 5 finally realized. Even looking back feels eerie me. would unconstitutional? Mask up!!! Pray Gawd Bomb revelation neighbor, illuminate path forward, path mask. arguably unconstitutional think SCOTUS going rule it? like trump. Trump rhetoric action made mask wearing political harmed American ability contain pandemic. Newsom made worse making health safety guideline joke. 

We know newsom California elites’ golden boy, democrat. need removed real Democrats state voted 68% Democrats. Wait, people easily cross state lines? Interesting . . . relevant username living comfy reddit bubble see part unconstitutional. government sitting around willingly genociding people they're billionaires, however, is. go 1am It’s empty. I’m legit night owl I’m active hours. Usually place myself. lift hard body weight stuff doesn’t really meet needs. getting 91% capacity stat?

Also, every reply apart overall narrative thread actively overloaded. arguing case others. let get follow health order spread people, responsible outcome. choice willing made.

That's comes to. responsible not.

For example, took son doctor week. guy Trump hat wearing mask chin. can't avoid taking son doctor. Even though I'm everything I'm supposed to, I'm still exposed assholes like man. catch covid (and I'm likely catch someone like enjoying publicly flaunting rebellion opposed people careful) bring home elderly 70 year old parents, responsible spreading around. everything should. willingly put everyone around risk. damn proud it. kinds places unique total scumbags. Agreed. think states decide US fuckin huge state different- allowing free movement states doesnt make sense. least required negative test travel something. Would hard enforce though. federal government's authority pandemic mostly keep lines communication open states talking other. 

The federal government forced fill role San Francisco plague, Texas, Colorado, Louisiana recognize California 2 years. helps give facade normalcy consumers, continue consuuuuuuuume 

Optics key. easy forget pandemic somewhere everyone agrees happening. people wanted them. Work consume. Work. Consume. ""This virus hitting rural urban areas alike,” Grassley said. “No community immune. ask every Iowan continue part keep family neighbors safe.”


Although wearing mask spoke, Grassley encouraged Americans “wash hands, limit activity outside household, social distance, wear mask.”

Imagine things would looked like year GOP said things 6 months ago.

Edit: Added quote story context admit getting caught made front page news. Imagine else admit....not yet, news hasn’t beak yet. Thank you! one sanest comments I’ve read. Everyone needs read article hospital staffing shortages, yikes. 

And anyone hasn’t read yet, also recommend reading article ever increasing toll COVID societal ineptitude taking healthcare useful resources tracking crushing surge hospitalizations facing (especially Midwest).

[Total hospitalizations Gotta poke em sharp stick make sure they're crisis actors. Korea done great job keeping cases low imo enact harsh restrictions 2 weeks get really low. Well, assuming bombed Iran, fired everyone Federal government Biden White House, might one end January. I’m sure guess it’s makes people think it’s okay public 100% safe. keeps people traveling shopping. heap lot blame trump initial attitude tone set beginning. downplayed, show good example followers decided mirror cavaleer attitude (you know, stuff masks, grand conspiracy make look bad, china china china) - get it, great, holy crap, lets pull together listen experts people PhDs stuff continue path caution rather alternative: ""Its hoax, theres virus, live life, screw you, muh rights"". level balance this, lean towards discomfort inconvenience. makes sense stay around town huge funerals.  get discount group cremation services wakes matter time start making flow map That's numbers manipulated.  processing fact total number deaths could fill football stadium couple times over.  I’m lifting hard start breathing hard sprints I’m sucking mask in. fine wearing walking around gym actual exercise pull down. Fauci made one terrible call early everything says gets disregarded one mistake.

I fan telling public wear mask—and understand (mask shortage blah blah) suggestions he's given since great advices wish country top level would follow. Seems long. Everyone involved call things move quickly. politicians asking travel ban too, [they demand lockdowns travel restrictions state due covid turn right around get plane Maui large conference. ok fly planes gather large groups, proles can't handle responsibility! rewatched 9 5 today (needed break news) humor held well (made 1980). Love coworkers outsmarted sleezy boss. 

As recall, also involved children’s literacy. great lady! mean ""we"" Tbh selfishly kinda hope people scared take first lands. way first line... take predictions grain ""I see little commercial potential internet next 10 years,"" Gates allegedly said one Comdex trade event 1994, quoted 2005 book ""Kommunikation erstatter transport."" realize Democrats *already* control House right? increasing number Democrats House change party majority minority. never said wanted close 10. want lockdown quit half assing shit, quit allowing companies label non essential workers essential close pretty much everything. yes laid folk take welfare, government thinks good enough give millions using safety net good enough rest. Thanks right thing staying home. don’t think many false positives. It’s possible roomie haven’t infected. It’s guarantee spread housemates. Best wishes either way. super frustrating!

Up now, I'd give Newsom solid B+ California's response (at least relative rest country). makes angry -- knocks full letter grade.

He can't afford *not* set example time like this. stupid outing feeds whole ""elites live different rules"" mindset, causes public rebellion, leads less compliance before. that's 100% Newsom's fault.

Literally speaking: many thousands Californians slack hearing (""See, even governor...""), behave properly, spread infection, percentage die? Like... dinner worth 5, 10, 15 deaths, Gavan? One would think much documentation already generated hands FDA. skids already greased. friend. fancy ones actually dry butthole warm air!

But get manual ones, use way less toilet paper. use 3 squares pat dry.

Point wipe shit yourself. Less toilet paper use bonus. ... like cheese. Ontario's incompetence showing inconsistent definitions restrictions. difference don’t think needs done don’t think locking citizens guilty crimes ethical. genuinely can’t fathom anyone thinks good idea. bring tons collateral damage actually find worse virus people (not saying covid isn’t dangerous virus but, 70 high risk, fact virus you’d consider exceptionally deadly). totally favor shielding vulnerable wish shielded - many probably want isolated away others - letting everyone keep supporting businesses educating kids, wishes . infrastructure place people wish avoid contact - curbside pickup, takeout, cashless transactions, apps everything, etc. elimination strategy particular circumstances makes sense. 

There uniform response federalist system (which another reason cannot compare Vietnam Thailand). like EU.   Teeth downhill adventure anyway. try slow loss. 1 600 New York.

1 700 Massachusetts.

1 1200 Florida.

Plenty elsewhere—I picked notable states compute.

And every death, dozens hospitalized severely incapacitated, many experiencing long-term permanent organ damage even know yet. imagine bad last 4 years would executive branch authority unilaterally declare something important closing businesses forcing people stay homes without law passed?  


Congress blame complete lack federal authority respect virus response, body Washington authority pass law. Sure. someone going gym primary source exercise vast majority adult life simple. anybody know find research online? Thanks it’s done. became clear infection could spread asymptomatic carriers don’t know they’re infected, made clear strongly recommend masks,” Fauci told O’Donnell. said, ""or even taking handwritten order"", whether dictated phone live person voicemail handed written sheet paper.

Put back car (contactless), deliver doorstep cash envelope taped door. one area think states could easily subsidize delivery fees encourage people use delivery rather in-person shopping.

There absolute need anyone besides employees step foot store. get people want to--used it, picking produce, etc. think something reasonable deal without months vaccine ready.

It saves employees contact infected people, avoids confrontations improper mask use store, avoids people touching items screened full PPE. safer buying experiences safer employees consumers alike. Probably not. President pro tempore longest serving member majority party. custom existed since 1940s. Given McConnell's position majority leader probably select someone else. ever became situation Senator Pro tempore next line presidency would lot pressure select someone suitable. Right, multiple accounts multiple sources propoganda, meme sources fact. Seriously, ideology worship, better defending it. good 30% country repeats conservative talking points. 

And another 30% repeats liberal talking points 

About 20% might actually make informed opinions. rest (like me) don’t follow politics enough make informed opinion, knowledgeable enough know simple things. Like wearing mask prevents spread airborne diseases. Yeah, know sudden everyone expected video, office, audio calls norm. Costco make exceptions anymore. mask, entry. fully support 100%.

Once saw self-recorded video June Costco politely kicking maskless dude --

I came 100% stay-at-home/curbside actually *started shopping inside Costco*. Never problem. 100% compliance every time. Love it! article mentions test uses [LAMP pretty neat emerging technology. 

“Because LAMP isothermal, eradicates need expensive thermocyclers used conventional PCR, may particularly useful method infectious disease diagnosis low middle income countries.”

Part device appears pretty cheap newly developing process pathogen detection. wrong. obviously know republic is. think sufficient testing done children yet (maybe changed). case, think children low priority time.

Ever since retired USPS due covid having. bad heart hes hermit. personally would like see California ban travel South Dakota pandemic well over.

Realistically, constitutionally sounds like ""interstate commerce"" (U.S. congress) issue. 7-14 days think. It’s roughly ~20 days infection death. one hard parts Covid hospital perspective - people hospitalized really long time. tried Pixel Labcorp? one. ship ship back, handled everything insurance didn’t pay dime Part equation would factor commuting, traffic jams, cars built, etc.

Plus, many homes heated cooled extent whether anyone's home.

It would cool convert office buildings reliable indoor farms. No. Masks like war. That's stupid analogy Nope. ""waste"" money, rather, investment, especially client-facing business wining dining win contracts. Besides, execs get paid matter travel budget is. imagine happened eastern pact well. super dumb never heard anyone suggest we'd mask 2025.  people care, sure people put mask nose exposed get store basically means mask. seen people come mask mouth walk store lower talk ever came sneeze etc.  Whenever name age listed like preparing see listed dead already priced in. Approval assumed. agree Dr Fauci, federally imposed mask shut-down quick way Trump cult legions demonstrating.

That's ironic statement call fascist dictator yet realize power unilaterally dictate thing.

You're begging tyrannical measures misunderstanding power lies ignoring technically illegal constitutional. husband’s hospital “suddenly” filled covid patients last month. newly opened ICU filled instantly started sending people hospital 40min away. incredulous particularly sick patient moved another hospital due lack beds (as in, hospital pretty desperate move risky patient).

Last week, found feeder hospital hour away reached 100% occupancy. Presumably, divert main hospital downtown. fills up...? *before* hit record numbers. Every. Day. Hospitalization always lags behind rising infections sure what’s going happen next month. Oh, there’s thanksgiving.  regular people buy COVID-19 test machines? heard podcast called Sway Silicon Valley billionaire, Chamath Palihapitiya, talked owning one. said cost $5k machine ~ $30 test. Like that's lot money, time think could crowdsource 25 families neighborhood friend circle pay $200 buy one. missing? feel like would marketed actually feasible solution able socialize safely. late shit, Bro.

Yea, it’s waste. president king make unilateral decisions never been.

The president give guidance agencies enforcement existing laws.

They cannot mandate legislation outside congress thing would require unconstitutional first place (probably legal). There's thing all-capitalist country socialist country.

I think excellent summary situation agree conclusion. social structures series compromises although capitalism tends excel areas get deeply concerned when, describe, applied haphazardly others.

A nuanced, even blended, approach seems work best. inferred, one must always determine objective choose suitable tool job. free market might good efficiently allocating hospital resources 80% time, remaining 20% cause serious risk human health efficiency gains simply worth it. examples apply across world. 

Thanks writing up, good read. enforcing masks? I’m San Diego everywhere go people masked 8 months. rare see someone without mask except outside. governors don’t know COVID-19 airborne? Sure not, thought welfare created temporary safety net middle class situations like this.  appearantly right live considered part human rights /s Help understand. What’s plan, needs done differently.  already says except transitioning presidency Biden. seem like could use incarceration Oh, fuck sake. people fucking idiots. takeaway can't even leave house walk dog. going tough. Good luck SA! Yep, happening! soon. hope pushing every day counts. happened state pacts? quickly dissolve?

California, Washington Oregon politicians realized legal authority popular support take strict measures lock enforcement could really mean anything. Government support mean set food banks people unemployment money, knows. 876 ICU beds whole country sounds egregiously low. incorporated Airline Bank get help. apply dine people still pick food eat home hanging strangers. Damn, I’m sorry. Im lucky HR pretty much back normal. mostly feel like I’m elevation start workout first 10 mins (I live sea level) tightness lungs following day (but also working may residual damage general). Fuck COVID. Glad you’re feeling better thanks reminder take easy. Wish could get “poll watchers” “election count observers” observe people COVID ERs hospital units gasping breath. (Although might claim fake, too.) Feel sorry way feel sorry coal industry.

Times changing.... better. Time governments encourage move towards new things. enlightened centrist surely let know do! Gtfo sides bullshit. federal government authority? give authority?

It's kind weird people saying trump needs strict lock measures ones saying he's fascist authoritarian dictator.

Nevermind president monarch whatever want.  pretty cool. Thanks! Finger food platter open casket right guys? stop caring peer review?

This academics. work regulators like FDA. ☝️ That's point it, starving average people despair would rise government, replace friendly regime profit(or least supposedly already regime change Iran 1953) nobody reported Idaho? 35 Idaho , highest death number . Wrong. totally different Taiwan New Zealand it’s even worth comparing. New Zealand spent day driving six hours maybe saw three cars lol. people. 

I don’t want house arrest haven’t committed crime. Sorry offends you! region Australia instituted lock without exceptions even exercise. think wrong. government shouldn’t able power like that. luck! 44000 people already taken it, without serious reactions!  could indicative statistically insignificant results. 

No, absolutely couldn’t that’s data science done. see exponential trend mean doesn’t matter shit error bars are.  wow, that's pretty late catch on. buying shit first week January, felt writing wall something least bad SARS. Well, yeah. 

You asked people thought possible China testing hundreds millions week. said yes gave logic it. I’m gonna take time day find source didn’t invite debate. subreddit influence operation Happy Thanksgiving, responsible! I'm gonna bet eventually.  Finally someone read 10th amendment! Kudos sir  source says ICUs 91% capacity, new daily cases 40% last month, testing positive rate increased 20%, daily new cases things July. 2-3 week lag new case numbers hospitalizations. yet overloaded, one saying are, curve begin flatten now, projections clearly show surpass capacity sometime next month. Rat lickers Yep. States rights USA ahead rest world legal weed. they've always ability so?

Edit: Bit non-answer. AFAIK new power suddenly fell into, ability lockdown state something federal/state gov capable long time. Yeah, might be. enough information know. People realize covid causes death kinds ways various impacts. Makes wonder things might governments treated virus seriously. mean, they've always stayed apartment complexes. level ignorance crazy.   literally picked worst two.  Summer getting drunk packed bars fall full, maskless stadiums Coachella. 

Just give perspective. played concert March 13th. look back say “we probably shouldn’t played show”  It’s like children weren’t getting coronavirus staying home. stopping people ""essential"" bar crawls hangouts.


Yes, socializing essential. remember Jan/Feb freaking friends going happen live high risk individual fear really getting me. met silence.... people thought crazy.

Holcomb go kick rocks. 

All states severely impacted pandemic, hospitals rapidly filling up. 

We're fucked. 

Safety, ass. Document linked german language.

Document french: yesterday afternoon, 876 ICU beds Switzerland filled COVID-19 patients every non-essential treatment procedure cancelled and, compared March, additional beds certified ICU beds. Intensive Care nurses doctors best stay ahead constant influx new severe cases last resort move patients across Switzerland beds freed.

&amp;#x200B;

This come unexpected month ago, common practice swiss citizens hold weddings, Oktoberfeste events keep silent symptomatic people joining festivities. There's like 15 people Maine! claim looked ICU capacity. paper says 68% 2005 (it’s mainly percentage ventilators, figure click link. PDF file tried automatically download computer. bet covid wedding registry.  government get authority lock population? sub strangest taboo words. *Карен* get automodded too. They’re definitely lockdowns well. know people taking monthly trips party. Canada.  Yeah it’s sold know, amazing leader. seriously hope see rise coming months... maybe Biden work her. COVID pig cross-species infection confirmed Sorry love America. hope things get better clusterfuck president gone happening due letting virus run rampant

?? hate say this, sources please? 100% opinion. people shifting shopping local stores forced close state governments shifting buying Walmart, Costco, Amazon result disease lockdown. logic that? 

Also, POV sort hypocritical given threads people complaining people living lives normally ignoring safety precautions, suggests they'd participating pre-pandemic levels economic activity? 

""We"" need consistent messaging subreddit. can't complaining supposed huge number parties weddings people eating without masks also saying everyone home hiding virus hurting economy. new data released Department Health Human Services quantify crisis America’s hospitals closer detail. Atlantic’s request, HHS provided data number hospitals experiencing staffing shortages. November 4 November 11, 958 hospitals—19 percent American hospitals—faced staffing shortage. week, 1,109 hospitals reported expect face staffing shortage. That’s 22 percent American eight states, situation even dire. 35 percent hospitals Arkansas, Missouri, North Dakota, New Mexico, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Virginia, Wisconsin anticipating staffing shortage week. COVID-19 puts pressure hospitals two ways. One, staff members get sick exposed coronavirus stay home, reducing labor supply. Two, patients arrive hospital, increasing demand. surge cases makes factors worse. Hope ends divorce 🥰 Since child, educate you. meme poop emojis sources taken facts. joke, sadly don’t think picked one No, 10th amendment Lol, trump ignores him. like head advisor trump trump kicked out. he’s guy side telling us don’t hahaha You’re good human. hope good comes way level ignorance criminal. Wow. completely destroyed arguments actually addressing them. 

I never said taxes cause fewer people smoke.

I never said highest cause homelessness. Something problem without biggest problem.

My point simply illustrate laws cause harm. Whether cause harm benefit debate. Mayor Lori Lightfoot tweeted November 15th November 13th, 1 18 Chicagoans tested positive, within last week. sucks, feel you, definitely would go Chicago right now. Thank you, best husband well! divided 50 ""states"" act like sovereign countries general manager that's way less powerful reddit thinks. don’t get downvoted, true. Getting one type coronavirus doesn’t guarantee immunity mutations variants. We’ve seen people reinfected, know mink least one farm two separate outbreaks coronavirus. may issue time (immunity onset duration complex nuanced) could hit two different strains. Yeah dr. Anthony Fauci thinks vaccines starting distributed general public (he estimates April June iirc) start pretty quick shift half normal (my wording) full normalcy fall 2021 spring 2022 Stop ignorant.

It’s fear, it’s reality.

You fool. Read 10th amendment High stock market? Right, newly minted incumbents battleground districts. 2 year incumbent much easier unseat 10 year one.

My point still 435 house races majority Democrats. expectations set differently going election, would framed Democratic Party victory, was, landslide one like lead believe would polls leading it. wish details.  may true. remember week ICU. Christmas thanksgiving entirely canceled. national strategy nothing all? Oh damn. Hopefully guys get Sinovac one! we'll quickly find federal government jurisdiction controlling people states. best compell governors follow guideline. federal government authority make laws this. Read 10th amendment constitution. every city US. Northeast cities ok (not great, ok) goes majority Republican voters well strongest deniers pandemic. May learn freedom taking rights. virus taught politics, idea worship. needs host survive reproduce, like us earth. argue semantics, protesting illegal. Disobeying legal, medically mandated lockdown is. every right freedom speech expression speech Australia, bar examples encompassed laws. 

You however, right endanger fellow citizens. One always listen Uncle Joey!!!! go again... tad bit dramatic, think? gonna bother response nonsense. It’s okay fed. keep pumping stock market money everyone fine. Kind needed back January February latest.  Sad say much agree you. 

I expect we’ll back 2k/day within next weeks. idea top going look like... wasn’t rocket science He’s next line Presidency behind Speaker House. wouldn’t block it. wants take full credit use talking point rest sad little life. honestly impressed Trump well ""This week, 1,109 hospitals reported expect face staffing shortage. That’s 22 percent American hospitals.""

What politicians fighting masks getting this? Vital restuarant owners employees need make living. market determines businesses essential. funerals lunch dinner included? I'd like get loop continue till there's 125M people USA  governments European countries even considered lifting restrictions better handle situation. waited long lockdown second time.

I'm guessing focused economy care people dying, bad shape today. Oh agree it’s kinda pointless, saying newly Infected person probably contagious Dr Fauci need read constitution stupid Houston set rules get overwritten Governor ""too much"", ""breach rights"", etc etc. Trump okay got worse, allowed cities begin locking down. we? read another paper they’re $6-8 wages nearby hospitals. Think, Sheeple! strategy separate drug therapy, goal vaccine. vaccine produces part virus inert body recognize attack it. Like handing wanted ad picture. body knows look for. It’s embarrassing possibility likely since trump constantly asking advisors aides president Many companies require employees use PTO use sick leave. choose responsible taking vacation. say impervious. specific reason, writing good faith. said can't find example issue caused vaccine itself, stand that.

Contaminations manufacturing errors happen tragic consequences.

They happen drugs types, also non-drugs like lettuce cars.

They increasingly rare, nothing trial timelines safe actual medicines are.

For reasons, feel like left anything relevant initial comment, edit people fact-checking anyways.

But say: Focusing single example contamination *80 years ago* state art medical laboratory looked [like relevant today? Using case *inspired modern safety practices* ignoring what's happened since practices put place?

To me, that's arguing bad faith.  know going regular shot, like flu vaccine? covid mutate fast viruses like flu? knowledge viruses pretty limited. Dio Porco? $50? know many times people need tested next several months years?

It fucking free.

God shit hole. vaccine itself, no. vaccine Covid it, something else stimulates body fight Covid. There's nothing ""pass on"" anyone need quarantine. said, came contact someone Covid, even unlikely would get get sick it, I'd still avoid everyone. 90 pretty shocking experts would predicted something 70 range. FDA would approved vaccine 50% efficacy passed clinical trials. Terrifying still hard watch TV get jealous characters. get live regular life, I'm stuck house.

It's jealously, like, blinding depression rage. great news gives humanity hope. It’s shitty year many people. Also high number doses manufactured mean see hospital worker coverage Christmas. game changer keeping ICU workers safe. “BiLl GaTeS mAkInG dAtA uP!” shitty what's happening nurses right now... dont know PA's situation much sounds like issue one hospital particular...

In ND governor enacted mandate allowing sick nurses keep coming capacity full understaffed across state. know someone working hospital ended accepting resperatory care position pay incentive, took away overtime pay too. get sick still expected work shit show without getting compensation signed for. wouldnt blame walked out... Fair enough. definitely get annoyed friends flaunt night bars house party social media, it’s rejoicing people getting sick bothers me. Keep going you’re almost there...  need hearing shit right now, might mean vaccines developing might bee useful, spike protein suddenly changed. However, like Febuary mutated strain, maybe basic makeup virus still same? Also, deadly new strain, know mortality rate, infection rate yeet? approve December 25th

Even everything ready approve before.

This would best Xmas present human history.

Imagine waking bed covered blankets outside snowing, hot chocolate, turning TV first thing see news vaccine finally approved. OP wants real medical advice, talk doctor, Reddit.

They answered question. could said rude. they’d able get better/fair pay.

They're getting free meals, free medical care, free housing everyday despite committing felonies. f bitching working 2 dollars/hour. Hahahah. bet haven’t outside since March. needle in, mask off. Sucks ! ignorance fucking lived. get white knight shit here. stand self get help, yeah hars sucks. can't change cards dealt, options next hand. Pfizer announced demerger shareholders last week. helped amongst stuff others saying me, welcome. indeed humiliated would ever need wonder President United States might something petty ghoulish. necessary strong opinions petty things. think anywhere maintains large population minks related animals high risk mutations, potentially bad ones. Wtf know. worked histopathologist university big pharma 10 years. vaccine rushed implemented faster vaccine human history. hopium crowd phd’s cosplay protesting zero real scientific experience work education. WANT vaccine work take one one looks safe. vaccinated hepb, rabies (x2) well smallpox, I’m antivaxxer. Well 0.2% difference population hundreds millions Beautiful thing wake to. give hope 😭😭. wanna go normal vacation abroad late summer want certainty whether go math implying everyone US population got coronavirus. means ~0.07% population US died *so far*, aren’t anywhere close herd immunity. group likely chance vaccinated April/May. Possibly March states depending distribution plan. Based sample size of... 100ish? trust that. 40,000 enrollees 100 samples make conclusion Eh... highly censored subreddit.  Political discussion forbidden despite important topic. Thank you.

I keep reminding folks Covid preamble. get lot worse.

Earth's population go 8 billion. real hell still come. well said. conversation become politically charged toxic. 

Bingo.  Tbf clinical trials like 80%+ work cost development way getting mRNA vaccine long term effects clear. Marshmallow test? one knows virus hasn’t around long enough Especially can't send kid school without vaccine, board airplane, get Disney World.

Are sure would enforced? Disneyland measles outbreaks [within recent measles outbreak Washington Oregon [last 80% school-age kids ~~the Portland/Vancouver area~~ (edit: Clark County, Vancouver. give numbers Multnomah) vaccinated. (Even though public schools generally require proof vaccination enroll, parents get waivers medical, religious, nonreligious ""personal belief"" reasons.)  Good thing 1940s/1950s using inactivated covid make vaccine.

This relevant vaccine sky blue Yes. Unless outright lied us several times, including writing, saline. Yeah, seeing “terrifying” aspect. one totally agree you. Especially case cite! 

On other...I’m pretty pissed former friend got Covid running around traveling attending lots house parties. stopped around behavior reckless, sure enough half people house party wound it. case mild. recovered insisted big deal promoted social events like nothing happened. She’s still galavanting place, wearing mask, partying up. can’t respect this. 

I would feel bad someone got std cheating spouse. guy sleeping bareback prostitutes every night? much. Sorry, mistyped answer, meant figured short incubation means symptoms showed sooner, less asyptomatic spread. So, exactlly new strain mean, Herald article accurate? Would change game, comes vaccine? spike protein changed?  Yeah guess. take government actually enforced real restrictions paid people stay home wouldn’t rely idiots behaving, idk. get it’s frustrating time definitely don’t blame people throwing hands either. even talking about?  
Feels like massive cope.  
I swear people talk @ss days funny you’ve ever done even basic research. 

It’s called “confidence interval” 90-95% standard deviations used. Oh right, course. COVID denialism significantly support units... Fauci estimating sometime April, vaccine available general public. Depending many vaccines get approved, could sometime March. That’s four five months anyway. another note, chaos, it'll feel rewarding knowing good side history! We're saying thing. many minks culled existing people decided eat farms close proximity humans, caught disease mutated them. I've looking sub daily since February, I've never subscribed. hate sub, every day come choice, can't wait stop this. Thanks clarifications. decision, idea. seeing stated many times mandatory think suddenly change it. Perhaps satisfied later percentage people vaccinated. Good thing humans great delayed gratification Supposedly, yes. vaccine approved, said they'd unblind study - even vaccine another company's.  Must ND Governor asking nurses suffering Covid-19 keep working.


Because sure Covid-19 disappeared Easter, spring, summer, nurse describes 'The Pit,' room coronavirus patients sent nightmare’: Topeka hospital boarding patients hallways, waiting Rounding corner. Upwards. sTaTeS rIgHtS. No, no, no, cIty rIgHtS. Wait, no, pEoPlE rIgHtS, yeah, one! BioNTech Moderns specialized mRNA therapeutics pandemic they're know happen completed trials first. basic technology simple add desired genetic sequence go. companies trying various different vaccine types. traditional inactivated virus vaccine needs absolutely certain virus inactivated avoid infection. Formulation also complex task. answer question, beyond knowledge. counts ""in hospital""? mean people staying overnight, someone coming checkup? find info that. appears planning wait Thanksgiving holiday, moving include days next week classes. Minor correction traditional vaccines necessarily use live virus cells final product. often concentrated viral protein similar mRNA vaccine tricking body producing.  
So traditional vaccine go bioreactor manufacturing process produce purify protein mRNA process consists mRNA lets body make protein. 😩😩😩 sincerely hope whole sub archived last post ""SARS- CoV-2 eradicated."" way I’m getting while. 

Idc disagree think I’m stupid I’m getting vaccine looooong time. 

Not anti vaccer covid denier. Simply don’t need first get healthy person risk. Lol could lower severity disease. Maybe people still got infected asymptomatic. know point.  You’re one fear, dope. 

Go cry Bill Gates somewhere else. China showed us clearly one way handle it.

I would’ve preferred harsh lockdown two months food, medical supplies, essential items given rent mortgage halted. 

But nooo, live shit hole country. Thanks, Abbott, consistently keeping Texas strong killing weak Texans.

What shitty governor - makes ashamed state, frank. Well shit, figured short incubation meat symptoms showed sooner, must misunderstood things. So, new strain mean? point drive friendly always kinda got me. city geographically terrible spot. Climate change may make even worse live there. It’ll free pay thousand per year medical insurance! It’s free (in US least) 99.98% survival chance whole population, problem. People parrot number imply everybody chance it’s simply true. lot people 50... really dance around aspect, they? Unless there's risk children birth defects, tell prospective parents hold conceiving? happy you. imagine job like. governor CO press event yesterday said, verbatim, schools safest place kid right now.... Come theme parks, stay covid. gators...  even study says. says recommendation ineffective. info compliance recommendation. Maybe that, lucky, precautions take working. Thanks them. Oh still fucking half year away. Good fucking god Ok we're back masks work? way OH YEAH?! WELL ""AMAZON PHARMACY"" COVID VACCINE 96% EFFECTIVE!! 97% TIME ANYONE ELSE SUCCESS! ~Jeff Benzos I'm saying he's psycho. wearing mask day work must bordering intolerable point most.  pandemic? notice it. around 37 people Thanksgiving, cancel it? I'd say there's that, sub tends push back mainstream media. Yep!! saw ""updated"" couple days ago laughed ass off. ""timing"" perfect. Louisville disagree, I'm highlighting short data sample infection may possibly strong seasonal component. know get upcoming season.  thing is, talking safer holiday celebrations *July*, waiting two weeks Thanksgiving start making plans. ""If outbreaks happening area, here's do/If cases low area, here's do"", could simple giving people good ideas. Instead, decided bury heads sand wait things get terrible react, mistake made Spring. 

Here's sound advice: cases low area, wait arbitrary holiday tradition see family know damn well outbreaks may happen. agree, know anything politics state government intervention make happen. democratic governor barely keep mask mandate place every action takes met lawsuit republicans. gerrymandered hell here. Everyone take care best can. : ( [Me seeing news  -75 C. better still shit. suspect us bit lower right though, due accurate rldeath numbers compared many countries  real treasure really love wholesomeness husband. seem like amazing people.  downvoted Price gouging increasing price emergency. proof always sold higher price emergency might okay.

What’s sad 1/10 people getting vaccine die/get side effects 😳. increasing *from 12 13, *by 12 13. Looks like currently 32 patients already ICU COVID. go back double check, that's read it. Welcome back Zoom hell, get ready never leave kids. absurdity charging hundreds insulin month lol. 

The system needs complete overhaul. mentioned activity often ahead actual news. Markets reacted vaccine news ago, they’re reacting details, like difficulties storage distribution. Yea, Victoria go back untill 14 day average like 15? 10? even though 0 daily cases wear mask school. pretty interesting see America doing, seems counter intuitive. sounds like win win! Ahemz, mean resumed?
quoting article:

Forces England Wales resume issuing £10,000 fines breaches Covid rules gatherings 30 people, police chiefs said. preliminary studies agree you. can't wait day come say ""if already it, good go!"" remember back saying US could see 30 40 thousand deaths people saying scare mongering. Nope, go book vacations now. also good hope get coming months invaluable resource fight COVID-22! God hate saying much. much cringe Next sport craze: fights TP! trust pfizer claims. lawsuits anyone else known lie mislead people live, everybody allowed least one April. 4-5 months. propose quit job fuck patients need help?

Are still phrasing? awesome, thought difference wasnt sure. that's tough one. I'd whatever quarantine long see her. I'd keep masks house stay back can. I'd petrified getting sick. I'm sorry dealing this. mom died back cancer stayed away heavy chemo kids littler used bring home every sickness school. always afraid catching something them. used wear masks gloves go bring anything luckily worked us. I'm quite sick elitist mentality billionaires politicians tell us polluting much need cut back already meager lifestyles, fly private, several massive mansions, consume insane amounts goods. donate large sums money hamper lifestyles one bit publicity avoid criticism. live cramped 2 bedroom city exclusively take public transport really want taken seriously. Mexico still never close air travel, people drive san diego tj every day. canada hand..... wrong. misunderstood point apologies that. interpreted comment effectively come position ""It's important covid leftist conspiracy make Trump lose!"" I'd assume getting downvoted I'm alone that.

That said, wrong making political one bigger failings entire world's reaction virus. That's said did. Ultimately never political. Governments responded appropriately consistently encouraged things like masks social distancing. 

Discussing fact failed important long end discussion go church Sunday without mask prove sheep Government. Contact tracing(specifically US) bad idea begin with. much money spent people call strangers notifying virus. 2020; many spam calls day, one's gonna listen stranger telling leave jobs quarantine. really seem elementary understanding topics talking about. 
These talking points swatted decades. 

Yeah want total overhaul government. government terrible system terrible. 

If want argue days end six people owning wealth half planet combined good economic system, feel free.

As last paragraph, people associate appear greedy sociopaths mean that’s default state humanity. 

Also can’t separate countries fact US hegemonic power last several decades.

Good thing that’s dissipating quickly 😎. attending Thanksgiving kill you, attending might. I'm voting ""not attending"". Several states reach testing limits stay level.

You translate 300k 1% deathrate deaths reach point 2 weeks later got daily 9/11. Freedom baby! saw TV take FDA staff like DEC 8 prepare power point briefings committee.  guess never heard OT.  like emergency pandemic people dying... Fair enough.  I’m tired winning :( 5% lower, enough people tested.  friends bought house pandemic. viewed house alone. paperwork done electronically. seemed fine me. Let continue activities, comes large events like concerts sporting events there's reason let in. groups people large events. 5% vaccine effectiveness mean much 20,000- 80,000 person events.  ""Passes safety checks."" Right. /s folks think long mask on, invincible go anywhere, ie waterpark, skating rink, indoor dining, clubs etc etc. arent even people, makes want slam head wall ( live austin)  That's even real world always works. lose money get sick. That's reality people working mostly low wage hourly jobs. even reality them.  something sensitive sure they'll temperature loggers shipment. concerns unfounded. US cases totaling like next 5 highest countries combined ""funeral"" stocks recommending? I'm going CSV. Time crack [hydrogen sellers. signed kid summer camp felt good. barely left house since March, knowing likely able something normal next year nice feeling. There's lot interesting questions study raises. Given Sweden far north, wonder much role seasonality plays this? role played relative humidity rising temperatures increase? additional vitamin additional light levels days get longer? 

I'm curious much permanent shift due medical advances changes virus itself, much revert days get shorter toward solstice dry air winter takes hold?    agree Tegnell, slow increase sort permanent mark would better. Like scannable tattoo. Can’t wait covid-19 vaccine unboxing vids. Nothing contradictory controversial point. virus travel aerosolized form, according experts viral transmission.

And observable physics count common sense, can't help you. strawman like that, honestly stating fact? like makes virus less bad, still relevant fact. wondering Sweden singled out, book *Good Sweden, Bad Sweden* written founder Local might worth read.

And specifically COVID-19, [a scientific written July. 

It's quite fascinating depressing gone ""look Sweden"" mean something inspiring used cautionary tale. one thing covid taught Americans vulnerable biological weapon. Good luck! I'm bot, can't read. comment people getting protection, mask WEARER. work management retail. 


If wants go, I'll go wear mask to. I'm going stay away begging visit. easy situation.  Yeah, 6 month ultra cool temperatures, 15 days refill shipping boxes dry ice 5 days normal Pfizer spokesperson vaccine gets site stored multiple temperature freezers, commercially available extend shelf life 6 months.
he vaccine stored five days refrigerated 2-8C conditions. Refrigeration units commonly available hospitals.
Utilize Pfizer thermal shippers (that doses arrive in) used temporary storage units refilling dry ice 15 days still quite complicated handle: shipping boxes opened twice day, example, well functioning society able manage challenges. Oh man that’s morbid learn that?
Do eat Bats! Yes, virus spread day time /s second at-risk people healthcare workers vaccinated we’re going back normal. personally timeline spring 2021. talking theory, practice. I'm disability advocacy space here's example: Scoring systems using quality-adjusted disability-adjusted life-years used. overtly discriminatory explicitly counting year person living disability worth less year able-bodied person. Another “no fucking shit” day ""I can't breath"" - sparks chastising downvotes people supposedly care alot  Yes, definitely help working class raising interest rates sending economy even deeper recession. I'm sure turn wonderfully. Yeah turns you’ve got chronic depression anxiety then: social isolation, unstable schedule, unstable diet (yay curbside pickup), physical isolation, decrease exercise, deadly pandemic lack access mental health services outside telephone professionals would call *bad things*.

As learning I’ve taken up: wood working, leatherwork, upholstery, watch modification, two programming languages finally started reading (with mixed results). Edit: built models, studied furniture design bit, built legos. Tried drawing things aren’t meant lol.

And frankly, I’m fucking tired neurotypical people acting like it’s big deal cus they’re blast wearing PJs work.

Yes right thing do. No, struggling endure doesn’t make bad person. People, 2020, much time, things mental health feedback receive via social media … like *look me, look hanging with!* masks, lots smiles, showing lots gleaming white teeth perfect haircuts. coined phrase *pushing buttons brain release happiness chemicals*. Many people find really hard things merely vs attention attract. “It April, like miracle”. Donald DumpsterFire 

This political statement.

It statement fact. I’ve heard December. think Moderna wants start rolling essential middle December? Could Pfiezer said that. Lol good talk. nice night associate word ""only"" word ""outbreak"" automatic delegitimize argument.

You might well say ""We're killing five people whole state compared ninety five people living facilities. risk five die far fewer!"" never works end. paper. mean wouldnt good times tho. Exactly - we’re aiming vaccinate end ASAP state going three week lockdown slow spread thanksgiving, sent article fiancé’s family planning big thanksgiving, said “oh well we’re still it.” fiancé ones *not* going. I’ve never felt alienated family.  number Austin measures, Abbot fairly regularly. need least one seat outlier dies. Dont forget healthcare workers. Meat processing plant workers too. What’s worse support went areas highest rates COVID deaths (probably excluding NYC CA). cannot wrap head around degree cognitive dissonance. absolutely gathering right now, be, understand people feel way do. 

It’s bullshit expect people come risk life work 12 hour shift fucking McDonald’s make feel like horrible, awful person wanting see family. It’s basically cog machine point. Exactly I'm going families. They're like earing outside! live PNW rains every fucking Thanksgiving cold shit. big nope me. normal close tho \*sobs Texan\* 


Here opposite problem, county judges modicum intelligence state governor attorney general love overruling every single order make taking court gloating it. briefings joke, unless never watched updates city state. pretty standard press briefings. going rogue lol know saying need wear mask knew wanted get worthy people first tell truth lying know is.   100% right, posting context Mardi Gras 20' happened didnt know shit go down. mean...some people busy selling stocks. lot truth this...DeWine enough sense listen her, failure hasn’t appointed anyone else left wrong.....but let's see results. Huh, far cry articles old stating makes us turn violent psychos. really helps take mind shit whether it’s Covid, stress work, bullying school...it’s helped lot. pandemic showed majority govern total idiots. sad. two things equivalent. talking initial infection vs reinfection. vaccine stop reinfection. stop initial infection. math yourself. 

Take 100 people. natural infection, 100 people get infected. 7 people get reinfected. That's 100 + 7 total infections. 

With vaccination, 90-94% get infected. Meaning 6 10 infections. 6-10, 7% could possibly reinfected. sake rounding, 1 person could potentially reinfected maximum 11 infections. 

It makes absolutely sense compare two. Indonesia :c Source? Right. government Canada distribute vaccine drs also done pharmacies. still tinder this, refused meet we've done video calls seemed worthwhile.

I ended meeting one woman I've bought ring I'm going propose. Ridiculous, found true love pandemic feel like relatively low risk. still possible date now, smart remote refuse first time hangouts, maybe meet two three good video chats went well. rarely go anywhere anyway right? Way relaxing log home feel like took risk someone click with. Plus, likely going anywhere serious can't fun talking video chat while.  makes think already ordering tons vaccines? Even dying Covid they’re still denial. It’s absolutely insane.

""Okay, clearly SOMEBODY gaslighted me. either you, trained medical professional; Fox News Facebook friends.""

*considers this*

""it must you, Doctor LaRue"" silliest argument mandates see way frequently. logic entire world completely lawless.

Of course always going people listen rules, laws, mandates, etc. still pass majority people going listen, least influenced right direction. “distance 2021” crowd suddenly non existent country in? Also, #14 Nov. 1787 Maine- governor Mills. lowest rate longest time two weeks ago cases rising. average 17-30 cases day months it’s 250. Well that's twice chance getting sick biggest issue Atlas' comments, he's encouraged everyone get together ""never know."" plenty elderly people 100% cognitive. may people would consider mentally defunct, interested able fully keep pandemic issues we're facing. 

There's also fact ""elderly"" mean 80/90.

People 60's 70's high risk ""elderly"" category. 

Difference situation grandparents 100% cognitive educated situation, made decision. 

Atlas piece shit, refuse grace title ""Doctor"" name, despite fact may earned point life. He's senior fellow fucking Hoover Institute irreparable harm moment. 


Not trying argue insult way! think we're page, least page two close opinion.

Just give little rant let steam off. 


I hope wonderful holiday season well, get without suffering pandemic. no, know. Raise taxes reduce number USD circulation. helped then.  Private prisons outright awful public prisons also terrible. huge amount money contracted run public prisons process getting contracts riddled corruption. entire system crime punishment US abhorrent.

80% Texas prisoners died Covid-19 never even convicted crime... It’s despicable. Anyone else feeling defeated hopeless? Sacrificed year isolation, unemployed 8 months, every precaution waste time. hoping we’d least achieve low enough numbers cautious holidays. thanks 54 active COVID-19 outbreaks tied restaurants bars right now, accounting 5.5% outbreaks. long-term living facilities, schools, manufacturing/construction health care settings more. article yesterday waited post according Worldometer, still slightly lower max peak August. Well pretty clear longer case within next hours. Yeah worry, 71 million decreasing next two months. bad. pieces shit.  I'm actually confused vaccine supposed work.

I mean, great, fuck. I’m canada larger geocery stores large pharamacies buy pick perscriptions.  schedule flu shots well. Manitoba, can’t buy alcohol grocery stores lol. 

So. Yes completely possible. us places performing covid tests approved testing sites travel Hawaii. 

As -70c , I’m sure grocery stores large freezers back. drs offices clinic may small refrigerators nothing keep -80c.  is. No, long able stay socially distant people household, need mask outside. - used revenue analysis Hilton pre-covid business travel ballpark 60% revenue generated. Dial back blatant racism bit maybe? Hilarious people think state state bullshit works national shutdowns 2 months, 8 months ago wouldn’t solved problem. Curfew 9:30 friends old town last weekend club. Sounds straight forward Lets clear, Republicans successful relative expectations going election. Republicans successful achieving majority house, lost elections won, margin defeat smaller 2018. actual facts respond with? post facts cry? attitude we're fucked Luckily he's also idiot bad it. [more sports game. trains get packed out, mass intoxication, etc. someone brings covid19 likely others get it. Okay quick skim #10 wish rationale! Well blows wants come visit us tomorrow. really position decide let in, though, mom's unfortunately lot things possible. First off, negative test between? people test positive months, even though end RNA fragments virus. 

Unfortunately hard confirm reinfection unless virus genuinely sequenced times. we're almost certainly missing many people genuinely get reinfected - still probably common. someone already contagious goes airport, could spread dozens people they're turned away pre-flight test. 

""Don't worry, one plane tested positive, person sitting next gate 45 minutes did"" oh no


anyway Joey Diaz called No, actually, say *expect* side effects. Like tetanus flu make people’s arm hurt. makes people sick. 

[plan feel Sound like couldn’t find source. think we’re stupid? people ends political spectrum would refuse help people end even could  Trump win 4 10 NJ Voters? I'm American. Prior Trump administration, unthinkable pandemic scenario spearheaded CDC (Center Disease Control, federal public agency) support state local governments. even pandemic response team created Obama administration help combat Ebola.



Instead, well... let quote [wikipedia page US CDC staff members spoke CNN story published May 20. officials said CDC trusted White House ""been muzzled"", post-March recommendations ""watered down"". previous administrations, treated ""scientists"", Trump administration, ""if science offering contradicts specific policy goal, problem.""* [Were 16 Italian authors funded found SARS-CoV-2 antibodies blood samples dating back September 2019.

The index case China started experiencing symptoms December 1st. November 17th extrapolation probably based assumed maximum 14-day incubation period, way uncorroborated report.  Won’t happen due red hats. absolves nothing, express appreciation specific action. Fila fish. FTFY mean conversion therapy, deny gender dysphoria? Cause don’t understand comment kind potential side effects worried first batch? March dealing novel virus, point knew virus closely related SARS MERS, partially East Asian countries reacted way did. China needed swift severe lockdown Wuhan ground-zero virus, East Asian nations focused keeping COVID enacting testing, quarantining travel restrictions. could started blocking flights China Italy, South Korea, Iraq countries COVID causing outbreaks. could accepted COVID tests Germany instead insisting needing make own. could utilized Defense Protection Act make PPE instead pretending masks work. highly doubt country would able level proactive would like given knowledge now

If that's case, Taiwan swarming COVID? Trump disbanded pandemic response team, proactive response would much easier. don’t need prove anything you. Even provide source you’d find reason discount it. Good them! doctor, can't speak affects health. One non health related drawback getting vaccines means one person wait longer get one. Getting one vaccine two people going help pandemic end much faster getting two vaccines one person point put couples names keep weddings turn super spreader events (and venues)? People excuse point.... know yer gonna kill body this, like drunk driving Bill Gates apparently worst carbon emissions culprit world based flight history. environment would like travel ban. least deadly annual death toll medical malpractice

What totally normal benchmark use calculating cost things.

I remember 9/11 people asked ""But terrorism deadly annual death toll due medical malpractice?""

Same illegal immigrants. BLM protests.

Totally normal standard use across board deciding declare states emergency suspension rights.

I remember 210,001st person Portland killed Antifa supersoldiers President could finally send federal troops patrol streets. focus federally operated companies would important. Washington governor lockdown bars, restaurants whatnot...

But Casinos open full. time. breeding ground disease. You’re likely following headlines instead actual studies theory children get infected viruses corona family giving horizontal immunity Covid.  Thats america.

&amp;#x200B;

Is uncivil Mr. Bot? Well maybe country taken seriously APril. It’s us. don’t blame trump- he’s symptom cause. fix unemployment wages

That's like literally arguing consensus monetary economics. Also, look back decade Great Recession. expansionary monetary policy undertaken Fed lot stabilise economy return real rates causes wealth inequality, worker class stagflation,

Rates go unemployment goes tighter labour market leads wage gains. skimmed, maybe deleted one. Anyway give up. Like said wanted see lol China Really ducked Replace stupid statues evil dead people good people like her. sad testing.  told lines still long recently around test, idea one location like overall.  Testing encouraged EXPOSED, show symptoms.  else going know asymptomatic pre-symptomatic therefore likely spread it. think unspoken truth one wants know. would need quarantine, one wants sacrifice give rights ""feel fine"". Schools dont want see numbers increase asymptomatic results known.  Workplaces dont want forced let people work home, find replacement workers essential jobs asymptomatic cases known. one way could start get handle spread... test exposed, quarantine positive, whether asymptomatic not. actually feel people believe vaccinated understand this.

The ones want get vaccinated already care people. think nosey neighbors lookout! DH

Sounds like somebody posts /r/justnomil lol Oy. check totally could been, yet are. 

Stay well everyone. :/ Fauci played long game. knew cards strong good enough go top. played survive til next hand. Well play hands. Lets see chips stack. No, he's probably thinking Portman. Brown also well-liked, he's proudly liberal. Portman solid Establishment Republican type, really Trumpy. Lol people hoping masks become normal thing. mine going trash soon mask mandate lifted. reading felt happy kids thought realized early call like this. 

Its fascinating idea, kept reading related penicillin bee allergy, first couple times response suddenly trouble. allowing kids get exposed unnecessarily I'm accelerating point becomes serious health risk?

There's many unknowns. Whoa...those people straight fucked up.  everything I’ve read could possible. don’t know enough say, believe transferred cats dogs IIRC.

Also possible correlation causation, much direct reason making likely catch COVID. Fauci thinks social distancing long vaccine. tell go 2022  know Australia! Thanks sharing, read. probably right. 50ish average partially full flight worse. one random guy started asking questions walking car.

I mask didn’t least 6 feet away.

The interaction less minute.

Is concern ? Thoughts prayers whatever RIP  DC numbers leveled around 45 per day past months, jumped 250 week. awesome. eventual movie comes regarding vaccine development going Oscar bait. blinded science.... That's daily record them. Cases today El Paso county 1,102 11 deaths per worldometer. idea hospitalizations.   shit Sherlock . Wow, that's actually way better I'd realized! swedish people subreddit defending long. Anti maksers people following rules, selfish idiots court mandated volunteer covid wards instead receiving fines. Let see first hand actions leading to. Taste god damn medicine, might actually smarten God, can’t wait wifi come back block ass. valid reasons vaccines able rushed effectively. 

Typically, vaccine’s developed virus isn’t prevalent. phase 3 take many years reach enough events determine efficacy hopefully reasonable assurance safety. Pandemic isn’t issue. virus everywhere and, seen, took months reach number events needed. 

ADE (Antibody Dependent Enhancement) doesn’t seem concern either since seen already. reason before. Pandemic.....virus everywhere. 

So major safety concern would rapid system issue like allergic reaction. think data also good doesn’t require much time determine. requires lots different participants. Hong Kong nurses go strike force government make changes. remember correctly, still kept skeleton crew totally abandon post ...I really wish nurses drs would go strike here. People need wake hell up. people ""the right make health choices"" right tank ability care patients actually give shit living home, professional job requires travel? Just... move out. sent dad firmly ""what Sweden"" crowd. respond. local food store limits TP one 12 roll pack. course yesterday saw four people one 12 roll pack walking car.  experience, work CPA firm people would fly back forth town clients week week. firm/clients know audits 100% remote, don’t see ever paying travel again. we’ll see. don’t think even doctors nurses understand medical billing. average American chance. 

That might well true 20% extra hospitals still can’t break even government regulations, cancelling avoidance care , honestly haven’t seen anything that. 

Regardless getting 20% extra according multiple sources. doesn’t need news. sure response strange format.  


I get that, get scary. scariness largely novelty based. Practice home. People often feel like can't breath first times try running. tell simply give running. tell take slow, keep slowly improving. sure mask wearing would different. Nope. know happening PA first months pandemic yeah. bats humans china first mink humans europe. Whatever, spanish flu, late change branding. States rights US behind rest world legal weed. glad paying high speed train boondoggle. partially succeeded NYC DC segment failed miserably every attempt. Costs quickly balloon 10s billions dollars even short sections trains nowhere. Witness California’s recent bust. 

The money better spent free buses, although white people hate things. become dabs, destroyer Doritos.  Businesses write cost reduce taxes government, surely business class also paid government? Americans killed collective negligence. Feel bad ones taking pandemic seriously - must feel like modern-day Cassandras warning impending doom seems like 2 siblings fighting running country disaster. America waking childish BS enough enough. went back read reports early April minutes ago still asymptomatic 12 days release. knows false positive back may well reinfected legit.  Even vaccine gives 90-95 percent effectiveness, infections happen. Anything July last week, months took years. thought Delaware? I've unemployed 7.5 months... half whole pandemic scratching butt. Wow. Nature amazing. Fitting Covid entered lungs without permission considering entered many people without theirs. Indeed main take away last year. wanted believe good humanity long, 40 years couldn’t optimistic anymore – 

then past year happened 

and feel sorry humanity wish could even minutely make difference educating beyond lies others would tell take money achieve power beliefs.... end trying stop mass tidalwave stupidity destruction becomes fruitless endeavour 

Then shake fuckin something neighbors starving brink becoming homeless looking screens made us blind faces nextdoor.

What matters end human lives around you. Build community, family, see people face face... Force will? Appropriate pandemic response point. got permanently banned r/conservative suggesting trump maybe wasn’t good president. got quite likes. Then, banned. thought y’all exaggerating sensitive are. nope. 80% chance apparently asymptomatic case turn symptomatic Happy 🍰 day! March April woman pulled PA fined $200 going sunday drive considered non-essential. expecting, ""Hi, I'm Florida. What's hope?"" first vax requires sub-zero temperatures transport administered, getting local supermarket drugstore

it months room temp vax like flu shot

and first responders people 65 get first 20 million doses (and need second dose weeks later) think teachers next line send death kids Tired trickle-down argument IMO. Economy historically worked fine interest rates par inflation rates.

Negative real rates causes wealth inequality, worker class stagflation, asset bubbles.. fix unemployment wages I’m saying US third world country despite bad leadership days. Hopefully don’t hear BS mutation. Jesus. Stop hating lifetime stroke man wanted attention along.  Fucking Mcconnell President Pro Tempore something happen Grasley it’s illegal... don’t get wave hands make new rules. must follow law. ya go. Realistic response. He’s literally trying stay president without won. wants praised leader without leading. wants power without responsibility. represents worst parts America got voted people believe America already great getting greater embraces diversity. I'd like see tech titans make rooms available homeless, [football players then... really think way last third pop. gets vaccine Trump gets national television. Highly doubtful happen though. reducing costs reducing pollution bad thing? Think Sweden, may help get idea. :) It’s always states rights. county rights. also released CT saw big spike cases wastewater, probably ties increased testing - people it, going get tested. Imagine getting married inviting 300 people fucking pandemic. Yea ton people going lose minds, government ""shouldn't things like national level"" give states top much power....

I seriously hope someone come say ""hey, y'all, need fucking close down, getting hand...."" feel lost hope happen. hate guy, states rights. Name calling again? would get worked something small? absurd. suggested possible theory. find extremely unlikely would cross-reactive immunity human coronavirus sars-cov-2. novel spike protein high affinity ACE2, furin cleavage site. Human coronavirus things.

It’s extremely unlikely antibodies targeting SARS-CoV-2 would reaction human coronavirus. Thank RNA vaccines. I’d rather live next one you, I’m sure. Dakotas? real reason nothing happened Trump want anything, pretended fine. Republican governors followed shitty lead. nothing separation federal state powers. President determined something could negotiated country wide response. #REV FREEZERS PFIZER-KRAB  someone come implement mask mandate MFL Philly please  know I’m 2 days late live Alabama it’s absolute disgrace living here. I’m chastised almost everyday wanting go things. I’m actively looking leave hell go? Half country like Like developing guilty conscience?

You take vaccine get money major tax break.

You don’t take vaccine without medically valid reason get fined, monthly, tax added “cost community”.  Visit Kansas City thread.

I believe we're seeing areas winter coming little sooner. quite remarkable quickly Denver went flat cases 5-10% daily growth. dude, I'm still using roll toilet paper using nearly 2 months ago. CA? zero confidence right now. Quick someone get walker know talking stressing hospitals time, death rate getting lower every day cause better treatment protocols, bad idea everyone get sick time, enough hands Yeah adults group covid patients got triggered diabetes type 2 find way out. believe you. delusions totality life. care you. hope find way out. anyone link source research study? appears TOI article (as well Reuter’s article cite) don’t provide link study welcome. seen studies that, impossible coronaviruses make relatively small portion common colds (the majority rhinoviruses) doubt see huge impact even significant cross reactivity. It‘s less year since posted Chinaflu sub, time sub normal, posting news situations China, posted people dealing national lock down. got many friendly comments also lots hate racist messages. 



Now sub became anti mask sub. America still covid mess. Keep screaming void man! least it'll make feel powerless rest us.  alone. I'm super careful since March well. Neighbors partying blah blah. worry - what's right. going last forever, unfortunately lot people mental fortitude tough out. do. lot people know strong enough hang there. weak/ignorant/selfish can't - winter gets dark inevitably - people like get comeuppance. There's gonna lot guilt people killing family members dust settles. guilt. Yes, lost it’s goal post moved. Sounds like president.

Ignore points you’re wrong. please check back 2-3 weeks we’re capacity Texans can’t bothered wear masks. you’ll see data still there, still proving incorrect. people list

Because historically always ends good. Republicans refuse obvious. Yogi bear  First off, I'm sorry hear child high-risk, must worrying you.

But, change statistics. distribution people pass away covid heavily skewed towards elderly. per [this states, mortality numbers include 26 infants 1, 16 people aged 1-4, 39 people aged 5-14, 410 people aged 15-24. compared 69252 people aged 85 years over, 59760 people aged 75-84, 49363 people aged 65-74. Cumulatively, percentage covid deaths ages 0-14 (81/223984) 0.036%.

Concerning IFR, IFR children aged 10 estimated 0.002% children aged 10 according [recent compared around 15% age 85. yes, covid affect elderly, overwhelmingly skewed towards (15% age 85 much higher even age 55 (0.4%)).

The extremely low chances young person affected enough ruin lives potentially childhood development well. disease poses reasonable risk elderly yet want shut society possibly full year maybe regard vast majority society. Mental health matter, quality education matter, social life development children matter, meeting financial needs matter, long everything pushed side give elderly years live. Nope. corona bonus ended 15th ""raise"" supposed supplement performance quality sound video. Also far superior features sharing screen, window, slice screen. think even multiple windows worked, working tool.
Then one favorite features drawing screen sharing person well attendees, focus certain elements presentation, web page, anything. 
The simplicity URLs. one number, always fixed personal session super easy share. 
Compared teams URLs currently share like 300 characters long, really easy.

Hangout always problems video sound, plus running browser made eat CPU like hell.

No matter people say, want personally liable anything. obeyed would stop two highest spreaders: bars house parties/dinner parties Alberta? It’s sharpest province  theory.

There exists immune cross-reactivity human coronaviruses.

This terrible article explain anything likely happening.

Likely prepubescent children got lactoferrin immunostimulatory induced coronavirus immunity passed breast-feeding. article study indicate asked even determine parent child blood types.

This occur mother previously exposed form coronavirus puberty. children carry immunity types coronavirus puberty. onset puberty, immunity start wear know why. Well mean, belief. Less central let local communities direct control. IMO bad itself, would also mean letting states close borders, manage affairs feel like etc know trump would complain that.  Trump wanted actually anything. pretended everything would fine, held back critical resources Democratic states. he's sulking spiteful. idea constitution first place? never understand people eager expand government power. Networking social benefits important fields important others. Possibly imo it’s easy controlling COVID state population larger countries get email almost daily that's desperate pleading previous hospital begging former employees come back provide relief staffing. feel awful former coworkers I'm good position state go back. makes feel incredibly guilty. know doctors nurses tired, scared burnt out. We're best right ever feel like enough. Check healthcare worker friends, we're okay. We're sick death people refuse take seriously. Wear damn mask stay home! big clear sign Halloween 2021 I'm going go completely nuts decorating house first time years  people stated they'd take vaccine **scientists** say safe effective. stated take solely Trump's claims wet mask also longer provides good protection. Around 2,200 people sadly died 9/11 attack single incident act war. completely different circumstance. Albeit state emergency given, coincide subsequent waiver citizen's constitutional rights.

I personally believe illegal immigration riots either cause states-of-emergency, even given, gross federal mandate given entire population take sort action fiscal forceful consequence noncompliance.

Trump didnt say ""send police control situation anyone else country riots, arrested - executive order.""

When Towers got bombed, wasnt draft.

Medical Malpractice CHRONIC problem resulted far since 2016 occurs every year act aggresive group nation - case neglegence could risk. reading comments.

What question, idea? possible vaccines making novel coronavirus also vaccine common cold coronaviruses? exact thing Canada. feds can't really much. much goes Quebec. Cause they're culturally unique want federal government much control province do. result. Canada decentralized. Trudeau actually factor Covid response. feds help financially. zero constitutional power say national mask mandate lockdown. whole argument explains people can't understand restrictions. exponential growth, either R=0.99 nobody catches it, R=1.01 everybody catches it. closing restaurants difference exponential decline exponential growth, saves entire society.

The question cheapest things closed get exponential decline. easy problem, summer figure out. Unfortunately base R value rising due fall progressing toward winter, whatever going one long series steps.

A sane society would pick cheapest way (it's obviously much cheaper keep R&lt;1 let everyone catch it) rest society pay (temporarily, done right) put business. think states money this, though, entirely unclear federal government ever will. Therefore we're asking shoulder entire economic burden (just side argument asking shoulder entire mortality burden). Back normal still wearing masks A-OK me. lost job March due shutdown, mentally able move Impossible look jobs I'm actually gonna like right now. ""hmm, grocery stores still hiring?"" I'm thankfully CO we're better Denver hospitals full run luck ran too. However, physical office Albuquerque though interact lot folks there...and coronavirus used go fairly often work also recreation NM amazing state sort thing. started, looking getting 2nd home use part year since work lot anyway even though position always fully virtual.

Shitty part many employees we've lost since started. acct manager I've never handled many exit notifications deceased employees I've since April...its depressing dwell it. 

Fuck coronavirus. yeah, starting nov, heart disease death wave grows january, wonder happen wave, go covid? half? nothing? go since people less stuff? go like every year? heart good every time see post Dolly deceives well deserved love. exemplary human being. Republicans refuse anything, especially Trump. Unfortunately Republicans charge pandemic, still are. Jan 20, least Democratic President. Senate probably still Republican (pending two Senate run-off elections), try block spending bills heavily favour rich people. lot people keep squawking false claims feds can't pass mask laws.

You one talking here. talking government structure, US, like EU, individual state responses favored. according worldometers, covid cases point decreased last seven days husband called job tell boss’ wife tested positive covid 8 days ago told boss today. husband anyone else works could well get quarantine 14 days. going pay time off?? I’m mad, fucking irresponsible. Thanks info. wonder increments? e get 1.07 next pay check additional months? got voicemail day imploring Staten Islanders part reduce spread. 

I moved Florida SI 18 years ago I’m wearing mask NY!!! least voice mail showed care. governor pretends everything fine. always power honest stopped reading admitted linked data area “not capacity” attempt prove hospitals capacity. drag goal post back, wrong. late purpose designation? obvious, needed? obvious, contradict point? Fun fact: it’s possible catch polio measles multiple times, chances less 1%. They're gonna start jabbing people next couple weeks.. moderna get act. Let's goooooo Super powers. He'll left I'll busy flying around US. Isn’t whole point States country founded allow individuals/states personal freedom Fed telling do? don’t like personal representatives vote out. It's...not going well. People follow rules well. FDA denies authorization, there's going torches-and-pitchforks march wherever hell headquarters are. worry stuff like mental health sake.

the idea survive pandemic much sanity possible. thoughtsandprayers It’s crazy quickly community spread increased soon started getting cold. look states biggest spikes, they’ve also coldest states last 3 weeks average temperatures.

I know leading theory seasonal virus spread subject virus stabilizes better cold temperatures less humidity. Another leading theory gets colder out, people congregate indoors more.

I believe virus could morph (not mutate) like gets colder spike proteins get longer something. Plants change form fall winter months viruses could too. Lmfao. Canada mean anything? Also US' war weed Latin America full drug cartels. Hey wrong all. virus people super ignorant. Unfortunately causes death situation. question is, dumbasses existed either way large numbers? told, basic ego shit. rebel. 

People based reality definitely put discomfort inconvenience spread catch shit. said done VIRUS attacking human race. person. 

All said done think Americans would listened anyone ""demands, orders"" anyway. Funny enough, listening Trump makes feel like rebelling. one wrecking smashing face hill seemed determined die on. sent data Houston, TX. currently capacity. haven’t seen “false narrative” stories us, yet. hopefully noticed, trending put place level 2 level 3 response plans add beds capacity needed. don’t go knee jerk response go omg need beds! make plans implement them. narrative matching data here. Unfortunately continue add cases here, since lags 9-14 days, we’ll keep taking beds. claimed data, sent data. someone else North Dakota El Paso wherever wants send data, fantastic. waste none life arguing something clearly provable. 

And last thought, let’s say everyone lying. Big leap way get entire medical establishment licenses lost ethics violations sued lie try trick plan. let’s assume that’s true, gain lying entire US fake disease? get doctors Europe lie also? shit lie defraud insurance companies extra Covid money, that? come insurance companies haven’t gone hospitals insurance fraud? real ideas junk? Italy said found antibody samples early 2019, probably covid older think. either follow covid zero strategy. live pandemic purgatory. Like federal national shut down? Wrecked putting mildly. shit bed people voted guess must COVID seem lost sense smell. OSHA unconstitution then? set baseline nationwide safety standards, successful preventing unnecessary death since founding. 

Let scientists set minimum safety standards Covid nationwide, individual states decide want stricter regulations that. disagree? Let's hope get amount deaths had.

In analysis go change season factor surge. Good decision. Go hard, go early gets control. Stop &amp; Shop Giant live PA, Washington DC, Maryland, Virginia. United States federal Republic, period. fact matter. constitution limits authority federal government and, per 10th amendment, powers delegated federal government reserved states. system work well face pandemic? Maybe not, far governmental systems go, America pretty damn good. avoids mob rule democracy, protects individual rights, prevents autocratic rule. pandemic point. want destroy overall good system government sake dealing COVID. 

The real problem American federal system, idiocy, scientific illiteracy partisanship permeates modern American culture. supposed anything except piss wearing mask would... wear mask Put screenshot /r/shitamericanssay. 😂 Wow write Sociaism Dystopian Fiction. would huge seller!

So would fine, arrest, pay person stay home???

So you’d ok Mom violation? see 91%. correct, overall ICU 91%, that’s “Phase 1” (less severe) room capacity. actually around 55% overall capacity including rooms they’ve set aside “repurposed”. average person seems misunderstand biased talking heads using misinform average person.

To understanding ICU Phases pretty fluid bit away turning away less severe cases.

I agree projections way up. Here’s hoping deaths don’t follow suit. 

Have good night! needed leadership, mandates court cases. tested confirmed positive before. assumed. I’d concerned getting airplane Given power wealth has, better that. content? honestly know teach n95. started handle it. I'd wearing n95 exclusively since March. switch cloth go full flipped classroom.

Granted, fact got antibodies summer factor lenience convenience.

From post history seems preschool. guess makes sense. project across entire room 4 straight hours lecture heavy day. Realistic death rates/case fatality rates worth, taken task reporters press conference enforcing mandates already place today.

Without enforcement, another worthless mandate. sure going see cases go way next 2 4 weeks. literally argue lack financial aid disagree decision, says right article  would re-elected landslide would relatively successful war-time-ish President leading us collective crisis. Instead played playing idiot base. Govenors follow Gov. Pete Ricketts approach. ""Let eat cake."" Approach. /s I'm worried logistics right now, takes time set distribution networks across entire country. Especially specialized equipment one vaccines requiring extremely cold storage. already dealing dry ice shortage is.  Yes. way viruses work bind receptors. use something called Antigens. covid antigen “spike protein.”

The way antibodies work, bind virus antigen, neutralizes virus. free antigen left bind receptors. get “clogged up” antibodies.

Antibodies specific molecular configuration bind specific antigen.

Cross-reaction immunity might happen two different viruses similar spike protein targets ACE2.

Since novel coronavirus unique spike protein it’s extremely unlikely we’d get cross reactive immunity common viruses. would pandemic... part made novel coronavirus pandemic body immune it. 100% Earth’s population vulnerable it. Dr Fauci doesn’t understand separation Federal authority powers state authority powers.

Influenza virus infection may identified many instances influenza virus detectable short period time and/or many people don’t seek medical care first days acute illness. reasons, statistical modeling strategies used estimate seasonal flu-related deaths many decades. counting deaths influenza included death certificate would gross underestimation seasonal influenza’s true impact. concerning bit users hand twisted order admit China already admitted world. America messed big time thousands died - see easy say that? fault admit wrongdoing, helps improve future.

Forget US - everyone agrees messed up, Americans included. vast majority Americans unanimously agree needed better, controlled response. beating dead horse. point ""China done wrong"" false, especially officials finally admitted treated Dr. Wenliang differently.

That's people make big money compared listen say lol. anyone else experienced input this? said “doesn’t defeat purpose mask?” security lady gave attitude said absolutely to.

It's least common senses. Humans act profit primarily incremental goal. 

Money means end. 

With business, money end. 

That's difference. So... isn’t science. 
Science until... prove wrong. 
So basically agree you.  Merica fvck yeh! we’re special kind stupid 🤪 pandemic already finished? Imagine wearing mask cloth face covering practicing cdc reccomended social distancing least 6 feet (2 meters) Actually airport riskier plane. Check studies done transmission contagion spread airplanes. Even actively hurting things would step forward. think getting plane defeats purpose mask. Masks perfect, even particularly good, one part overall strategy. everyone always knew stocks would go back crash early year, hard part guessing would bottom starting recover. point might come wedding *with* COVID. isn’t covid..but rather weight overeating? worry one kid’s resistant exercising..now he’s school.

It takes teamwork make dream work.

There’s “I” “Team” (Don’t dare f***ing say “me”).... know thought it!! “My freedom paramount priority fuck everyone came contact with, especially old ones” 

Americans nutshell Well, either removing pants, one prefer?  older human planet... gonna lie, 100% thought already died... horrific. Hmm... almost would nice states United way.. remember trump saying ""we 15cases, two weeks it'll 0 everyone say well America handled it""

Then saying it'll summer. 
Then drink bleach. 

Wild times. current plan US? How's working out? Well, *the Atlantic*, maybe looked way parties shredded social safety net fought socialized medicine tooth nail piggybacking stock market rest world keep boomers mollified, fucking mess. mean, know well AMA hired Richard Nixon's campaign managers (Clem Whitaker Leone Baxter Campaigns, Inc) come term ""socialized medicine"" fight Truman's health care plan, right? mean, *are* jornalists, right? supposed know happening around you, you? really really feel like guys trying anymore. Reminds playing Plague Inc. Damn. never throught real playing it. also reminds taking epidemiology course, thinking that, well get chance witness pandemic?

I’m sure we’re guilty that, doesn’t actually help anybody all. best thing come election high voter turnout reality check important voting well biases obstacles state place lean toward specific faction.

Georgia going blue, texas getting closer closer swinging (and lot states getting close well others actually did) BEST THING came this.

Fave proof every vote counting, things necessarily set stone. Aside that, yeah, shits bad Herd immunity unlikely COVID-19 exposure doesn’t equal sterile immunity. Herd immunity theory based vaccine usage “screw it-let virus run rampant” theory. herd immunity talk nonsense. applicable. Waste time. Look Sweden reversing course.  hope housing market crash, hope crashes *hard*. People generation never even hope house, real house, decrepit crapshack, forget generation one mine.

It business ever reaching stupidly high unrealistic prices did. One point. Covid cause heart attacks, strokes pulmonary embolisms. extraordinarily well documented Covid act like vascular disease gets lungs. selfish people selfish things harms innocent people puts stress healthcare system. vaccine literally around corner. postpone 6 - 12 months? now? vape deaths people buying shady ass oils China. covid spread vape oils would seen rise pneumonia cases along vapes deaths. sure familiar Asian geography Vietnam borders China. believe China's numbers there's way believe Vietnam's especially considering first case like Dec 1 (or earlier). receiving loads government cash. Winter even started, we're 1/5 1/4 cold months.  Thank good luck. I've heard seen horror stories psych hospitals this. quit last job covid response.

Has hanging questionable crowd. many days contracting COVID one become contagious? least Janeway got forget year. Flu vaccination rates up. figure people eager get covid vaccination we'd normally expect. we'll see pans out. Glad recovered.

In opinion, covid big problem? ate popeyes. good I'm guessing people get stage US.  Oh god!! could harshest methods planet result 85k cases??? Inconceivable! 

Oh wait, they've exported 2 dozens cases South Korea US exported 44x number Europe 28x number. Huh, maybe there's something taking seriously.

[http://ncov.mohw.go.kr/en/bdBoardList.do](http://ncov.mohw.go.kr/en/bdBoardList.do) Well sure shit going USA anytime soon. went back would staying folks period Microsoft Teams probably saved billions miles That’s grand ole way get straight authoritarianism

Imagine Trump says “Islamist terror national emergency, order keep nation safe Muslims must carry around special identification card” even states think that’s bullshit can’t anything overrule that?

Cases national emergencies NUMBER ONE way central authorities tyrants try grab power. states rights aren’t important then, they? you’ve never tried it, look DivaCups! great alternative pads tampons. Yes. law firm loving it. We'd regularly 50% us road day. economics us financing expensive flights full price hotels, fronting expenses collect client, interest surcharge. americans: “what’s that?” state shut quick get-go I've saying forever. like close borders. states fully open, others closed, easy travel states like peeing area swimming pool. say possible. said contention reinfections common supposition point, is.

The data supports contention. indicated conclusory not. think lot pressure folks take vaccine. imagine taking weeks work covid, driving companies insurance bills ICU 3 months, coworkers didn’t vaccinated. That’s good way made redundant. news? “I think almost half wedding guests gonna’ get sick,” Mikayla Bishop told station. “You're moment. fun. think COVID anymore.""

So, uh, *acceptable* number guests getting sick eyes? Shit deliberate killing large number people particular nation ethnic group aim destroying nation genocide.

A deliberate killing specific group people particular purpose.

We even get ~~ICE~~ concentration camps fit every possible definition genocide, I'm going COVID *alone*. people really shown true colors they're pretty. Trump specifically said wouldn’t allow state shut downs. Try get COVID test PA. within 72 hours even possible? must check symptoms find availability. AND, must PA resident would get test it’s even available staters? I'm still sitting fact someone reported comment made choice approve Good luck affording economy without business class subsidizing flying costs. fuck asshole. Idk restaurants talking know restaurants took years build business is. Never taking government hand out. think fault employees getting sick? choice work there. comfortable working go somewhere else. 


My god hope leos like never get retire, hope wind debt, die lonely miserable life. Fucking bottom feeder.  daily discussion thread infiltrated covid deniers. post downplaying threat covid denouncing lockdowns gets downvoted. yet message... shit   Thats Spain first wave. Central government took control everthing Feels pretty wired experiencing historic moment. Feels unreal super real time. Damn. gonna mentioned history books hundred years later. Happy cake day.  Pfizer started trials children young 12, it'll likely take long time approved use children (it'll require LOT safety data less urgent children get vaccinated- tend mild symptoms seem spread nearly much teenagers adults) That's actually bullshit. work mine breath hard move mask much face get full breath.

What gives? IMPORTANT thing remember der trumpenführer's watch.

he's going let people get away giving credit deserves. all- things gotten bad usa, might enough urgency get vaccine done quickly. that's *obviously* chose course inaction did. genius non-move, non-made it. hackerrank

Thank you! Classes semester end Dec 6th. looking something like keep busy break! 'voluntary' sense $2/hour may best paying job offered, need money buy books read, pads tampons, phone calls letters family, etc. world demanding Chinese tightly regulate wet markets have? 2020. one gives shit facts science. came Twitter, doctrine.  friends making bad, stupid decisions, sucker, join stupidity? Makes sense. Let's see attitude gonna lead coming weeks. That's true failure citizens case stopping held covid check, governments. 100% government's fault. actively fought science medicine, even called hoax first turned pandemic political football. 100% purpose. others preach hindsight......  made mandatory would like throwing fuel fire conspiracy theories NL also gone without single person 200 days. JK, many places 1 person per sq km lot cases? BioNTech developed vaccine Trump USA type crazy shit ya 5 years road many anti-maskers know germ theory is? think pretty basic concept, knew it, would okay wearing mask public. Well certainly possible, probably way knowing sure. bet point it'll turn non negligible proportion catch fairly quickly, it'll still impossible rewind figure 2x got sick separate infections virus. immune system's reactions different viruses end looking lot like other, hence many mild viruses cause common cold. Can't believe people willing kill grandma grandpa go protest celebrate Biden's victory. Crazy. expect lot public freakouts vaccine. ever get slightly panicky feeling going back old memories realizing ONE WORE MASKS?

...asking friend. many enthusiasts ensure know, work hard denigrate stats. worry anti vaccine people continue spread  also know vaccine long term since new tech, side effects vaccine large population really harsh too. people feel really sick vaccine days. vaccinating 80 year old that's already fragile, could endanger life. question deaths slight complications inject weak elderly, vs higher chance death virus, reduced exposure. died previous health conditions worsened covid, covid itself. Also, eventually peoples immune system become used anyways. wanna add: going know behind backs. know wont believe me, many dont. they're slowly taking human rights rhey want total control. covid one measurements use. Coulda sworn said would happen Monday. What's news? that's point? fair questions, unfortunately medical system US opaque patients, I'm sure great answer you. concerned I'd say absolutely read vaccines get cleared know designations. find meet standards, make sure record ask doctor. vaccine bottle include manufacturer, designation, batch numbers.

It may limited choices first, evaluate relative risks comes up.

My reason worrying even cases we're taking _extremely rare_ side effects. AS03 caused something like 0.04% people side effects without it. That's enough withdraw use safer version, way less dangerous coronavirus.

That's kind thing slips modern system. I'm okay tiny chance something bad happening means avoiding scary symptoms COVID getting back life years earlier.

But I'm strong believer people making choices. I'm trying share useful, clear data basis choices. cash out? jk K. Wendypants7, I'll try remember next 6 seconds life.

Edit- low level trolls like this, actually think affecting people's mentality? point, medical ratings come tested. Pfizer probably validates -70 *ensure* vaccine would get approved, Moderna maybe took risk higher temperature storage, risk paid ended working.

Maybe Pfizer's vaccine stable Moderna's temperatures, need test claim it. go first outrageous called Pfizer Vaccine developed german company BioNTech! Many deniers won’t read India.  Again, semantics. Classes moved distance learning. Laws passed, action taken, Sweden carried before. say hard approach, please put words mouth. increasing test capacity 25% meaningless considering time wasted waiting first batch test result coming out. batch size 10, 10% positive rate, 65% chance re-do individual test getting positive result batch.   So... still ""PCR"" sense DNA polymerase involved...

There's wiki article RT-LAMP techniques general: neat technique comparable qPCR terms accuracy. Much better rapid antigen testing.

I still think people try use wrong way, words declare safe/uninfected proceed interact ""safe"" people without precautions. end well still test negative day cross threshold detectable infectious day. one half stepping covid getting ass whipped I'm teacher, sure hope roll red carpet students go back distance learning again.  “The rest Americans free self-centered Know Nothings”. FTFY.  Thank service. definitely expand Veterans rights privileges fine women men helping defend us invisible, nasty enemy. Trump criminal stupid vet list posting ""not list"" Yes site uses dataset linked. Either way, cases skyrocketing, thankfully deaths haven't. Yet.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* worry. Almost half Americans want vaccine hoax virus. available countries take seriously sooner expected. love anything hair beard really *anything* going out. Mask + hat one knows am. Never going back. It’s list doesn’t matter matter was, already going dismiss bullshit even saw it. Tell every single point invalid. want. stay away me.

Unfortunately, that's going work. Everyone's decisions affect everyone else COVID. 

Too bad, it'd greatly simplify problem. agree that. wanted provide context 30 days super short, reflect agency pulling stops. none yall give Trump credit expediting process. Lets hear Liberal bullshit nothing it. *Disease vector movement aerosol virus particles droplets air pretty simple stuff.*

Not really. reports lab studies posted showing contradictionary results influence air moisture spread virus particles.
When comes small things, common sense trusted. soon vaccine becomes available lots people forget COVID. endorse I’m sure happen does, headlines trail stock price fall.

People memory goldfish comes things like this. They’ll forget Pfizer even virus around another decade. Curbside pickup at. there's also ways turn audio amber alerts Thinking future. want whatever you’re vaccinated highschools universities never closed, highly reccomended switch distance education while. highschools gone back 50 home 50 schools. Uni like intill like 3 weeks ago. no, recomendations many things things actual legislation. People Sweden tend follow government recomendations worked quite well untill reasently Covid-fatigue taken over. Therefore laws gotten bit stringent reasently, couple months. 

To say Sweden lockdown, even Hard approach would completely false anyone Sweden would tell that. know what, second thought right. Life point different, vaccine coming, world return normal.

Just safe, stay home never leave again. safe there. We'll let know 10 years safe come out! provide Source average age dying people Peru 31? would surprising. think vast majority people simply never even considered it. really bad mental health issues like public places, able go Kroger grab already packed bags paid online amazing. 

Now *everyone* aware service. Hey, text based emergency alert could still ""text"" general sense.

If specify SMS EAS, never know.

But could read article, Harris County sent emergency text alert I'm science vaccines. I'll get vaccine normal person can.... potential short long term side affects? *Next day* BREAKING NEWS. PUTINS ANNOUNCED RUSSIAN VACCINE 96% EFFECTIVE true first released mRNA vaccine actually alters way DNA responds virus? conservative friend keeps telling bs yet people still saying less deadly flu Yeah especially cancerous stuff gets posted government spokesperson I'd change last name ""Unofficial"" give plausible deniability. Thank detailed information, really appreciate taking time explain. probably reading times coming days think harder decision take upcoming vaccine not. invested personal moneys prediction made analizing data available everybody. prediction proved wrong would lost them, got right rewarded. least believe capitalism way go, wich Except organize indoor gatherings, dinners etc. 2 heart procedures 95% success rate failed: pls covid vaccine work love agree BLM protests good

Biden victory celebrations good

Trump rally bad Sweden 7th death per milion, 22nd Something something *herd immunity* something *gonna die anyways* something *prolly even real*.

- Americans doubt all. questioning whether effective future strains virus :) 8 people given actual vaccine trial. 100%. right refuse something endanger people.

I understand line thinking. refuse vaccine danger, would affect anyone else?

Also, people hesitant injected brand new vaccine mean they're anti-vaxxers. father died mysterious auto-immune disorder. concerned genetic proclivity, rush vaccinated. Looks great I'll take long term side effects established thanks Another study today put seropositivity rate one Indian city 50%. might legitimately, certain places, approaching herd immunity. safe proven years behind them. point? use pto wanna get paid calling off. don't, dont get paid. no, employers require employees use pto. no, always require employees use pto sick leave. Quite frankly, even given pto and/or sick leave, lucky. everyone luxury. everyone afford stay home. Thanks!! 
I live Hawaii. didn’t get hit like mainland think timeline little compared mainland. first major cycle came late July. Nothing Thanks try this. understand course, especially sneezing get weeks months coughing pretty heavily sick Asthma. would sad I'd expected wear mask even sick you’re fucking CEO you’d probably pretty good idea LOL good way check one still smell stuff guess... Curb side become pretty much standard two years ago. people probably never considered heard even make fun people it. 

*Wow look guy, can't even go shop groceries. loser.* want. stay away me. Slightly different may need -70. going issue, mainly logistics issue. Hopefully they're able develop technology let stored warmer temperatures. inevitably drops COVID hysteria over

This assumes quite bit. 'hysteria' might end, little indicate demand product years come. know talking about. We're point negative feedback loop right now. We're going ""a warmer planet less fertile land"" - we're going billions people unable feed themselves, temperatures equator completely unlivable, result hundreds millions refugees fleeing regions. almost certainly destroy industrial civilisation. absolute fucking insult people they've infected. I'm convinced many think all. seem outsourced outrage voices TV Net.

""Tell thinking free individual matter"" Yep, North Dakota started implementing restrictions mask mandates. South Dakota Governor stated ""mask mandates, lockdowns, massive testing contact tracing worked US abroad"".

I would like know thinks Finland keeps daily death average 0 1, 6 times population 4 times population density. lockdown, distancing, mask _recommendation_, testing tracing. there's 700k people north dakota? child abuse cases already going going since started. child abuse it'll ignoring kids day.

That really hurts soul. Part thinks ""Why people children, begin with."" another part knows many people children someone abuse. goes men women. Sometimes lose faith humanity. I’m interested social distancing mask wearing(for some) affect years flu season. don’t website last updated nov 16 tell I'm hearing counter arguments you, meanwhile they're making lot good points. Sounds like know they're talking about. F$/ Trump actually killed chances reelection there’s one thing should’ve learned Iraq War it’s something like 9/11 shouldn’t ever lead broad, drastic, national level reactions Mandates *would* trickle effectively actual enforcement.

Now, go back top start again.

Your problem step one, nobody currently charge gives shit citizens they’re charged serving.

Much federal “leadership” doesn’t *want* mandate. 

If did, could send military tanks secret abduction vans easily dispatched smother free speech. 

They love Covid-19. even love giving themselves!

We’ll never know circus monkeys could’ve accomplished national mandate several months ago, they’ve never cared enough it.

They’re busy trying flip game board can’t win, nobody gets play. deaths old people. vast majority masks n95s. seen studies show n95 masks work. evidence masks pretty weak, cloth masks studies show makes infections likely essentially moist rag front face day. know statues Bruce Campbell. Right ya. I’ve furloughed since March 13th. work school school idea they’re reopening.  agree area everywhere go everyone seems obeying guidelines . business travel involves getting front customer. fact half wife’s travel team related sh traveled 1-2 times per month. mean, agree Mcconnell voting Garland highly partisan, yes agree constitution predates partisan politics. I'd say tit-for-tat radical politics parties practicing damaging country. call McConnell confirming Garland ""wrong""- completely within power that. like first time senate rejected justice. [It's happened surprising regularity variety reasons last 250 McConnell ass nothing ordinary terms political process. 

But packing court never happened, 250 years. Even FDR toyed idea never went radical. benefit doubt long gone - governors restrict people from
Buying seeds, trust trusted repressive restrictions civil liberties imaginable. 

The people I’m sure cheering protests celebrations Biden winning want lock cities. It’s hypocritical. another huge reason it’s gonna fly. can't believe people think wearing mask makes difference. Randomized controlled study Denmark measured this, showed make difference, journals refused publish went narrative. That's reaction scientific community too, looks like. first, thought vaccine could take years, initial results provided cautious optimism, looking like could beat pandemic within year 15 months beginning. That's quite achievement. Pardon thoughts, reading threads, seems many Americans concerned rights, rather what's right others. realize things, hence decision cancel. try keep safe. appeal her. conversation let know feel way do. staying home. changes mind, her. tried. Yeah “temporary” right? Civil rights exist reason. don’t want live society prioritizes individual rights freedoms almost - maybe look getting visa going country rigid central government doesn’t constitution. dangerous set precedent government lock us homes reason officials deem worthy. 

As far know, America never done anything like this. least it’s winter there’s really nowhere people go. okay til second got warm everyone gave Okay? change fact tourism extremely bad environment natural thing humans.

My grandparents rarely left hometown 5000 people (because farmers) far happier lives 90% millenials escape empty lives travelling around looking ""experiences"" ultimately leave lasting impact. men dying virus cares? know saying “common sense isn’t common”? Yea, applies here. past year, nothing effective done stop control spread virus. hope new leadership, we’ll see positive change. Actually know, thanks patronizing reply. blaming “conditioning” can’t tell deadbeat husband get ass contribute equally? Take responsibility life stop blaming amorphous concepts husbands inadequate fathering capabilities. small percentage population actually risk (over 65s, comorbidities), almost seems pointless. become live maid.

That disgusting view stay-at-home parent does. Yes, right lots women choice. Especially schools closed many places. probably settled someone 

No, probably lives joke 1st world country wage kept cost living. family leave daycare going take majority paycheck. reality lot people America. Also, unlike civilized countries like Germany, protections pregnant women new mothers America. know plenty women fired maternity leave pregnant. longest time, women even RIGHT pump breastmilk babies work. workplaces, still don't. worked place told new mother could ""pump bathroom."" 

America good place raise family policies like this. 

Not everyone lives Podunk, Wisconsin. everyone support system/family watch child free. Sometimes ""choice."" someone si forced options. Highly unlikely Singapore.

Maybe politicians, yes, random rich person street. Among first people get vaccinated would healthcare staff including hospitals, nursing homes, clinics. forgetting elderly (probably 60?) maybe school going kids. I'm guessing last get vaccinated would average adult either working work home.

After might essential staff like teachers maybe foreign construction workers (especially dormitory cluster debacle).

It would quite difficult non-priority rich person buy way in. limited stock, vaccine program would definitely headed Ministry Health done government healthcare institutions first. Stock checked several times day (two persons counter check) lot/batch number dose matched National ID number recorded National Electronic Health Record. person administers dose also indicated NEHR issue vaccine certificate. We'll probably get notification sort (SMS/email/letter) eligible shot well.

So billionaire wants sneak shot, would first find person working hospitals steal dose. person would find way sneak stolen dose hospital. that, still use would official record person actually taken shot still unable whatever want like travel. husband asked nurse would happened tested positive, said, said above, strongly recommend babies isolated unable force mother chooses to. It’s possible varies state hospital; delivered baby Texas Baylor, Scott, &amp; White facility.

I also clearly said post would followed recommendation come that, please don’t imply would put baby risk. Constitution says, guy. Constitution says President “shall nominate, Advice Consent Senate, shall appoint … Judges the supreme Court.”

It say anywhere process applies party controls presidency Senate. Constitution predates political parties entirely, take ACB/Scalia-like originalist stance. 

It pretty clear intention there: President nominates, Senate kicks ball around gives vote. vote no, that's fine. Mcconnell even vote Garland. wrong him. wrong, somewhere deep inside keep things mom grandpa favorite teacher taught you, know I'm right that. Yes also fit category Quick! 

Get Paltrow house plant jerk into!  Nothing like deal scummy salesman person. new friend. Yeah point speaking would haves haves doesn’t change reality.

Which original comment touching on. guy said it’s crazy people patriotic 9/11 don’t care Rona. point everything politicized people tend repeat hear TV 1-2% make random percentages Reddit. Crazy countries able enact public health mandates health crisis turn dictatorships. bad US god-appointed exception rule reason. Yeah one it’s freezing cold time year, I’m pay someone run outlet toilet closet get fancy heated one. mean probably darkest timeline possible, somehow even worse There’s explosion cases CA schools shut. Paid tax payer money, deducted paycheck. Socialize health care Business events $Trillion+ industry creating 10million+ jobs worldwide, effectively shut since February. 

Yes lot unnecessary travel general (including leisure) particular massive loss local economies USA elsewhere. People cared 911 could tap xenophobia hate enemy. Rona middle eastern human, people would declare war. Rona “Sciency”. already war science. That's all. Hospitals insane overhead (which might add became expensive covid) student loans taxes probably contribute seeing less money first place. lose lose situation relatively newer hospitals. that's crazy. Unless testing people respiratory illnesses?  % suggests Poland heading towards sort herd immunity February.

Yes, Poland Nov 16 actually 59.3% 56%. close max score... Oh, no. ever survive? auditioning virus model, Covid fucked trying. need clone hospitals nurses. need them. believe wonderful father's..... coronavirus hit could hide office 40 plus hours week come home, see kids hour two bed. 

Things much different millions men becoming stay home father's work home. child abuse cases already going going since started. child abuse it'll ignoring kids day. Oh no!... they’ve already won’t get sick again. could get pass others. consider already infected recovered likely lot knowing won’t get sick again. likely carriers average person cautious. 

Good luck. Especially wife stubborn mine. made political sociopath never happened.

It's health crisis. happened oxford vaccine? Well that's modern formal education you, insult choice noble join healthcare industry, I'm definitely advocating child join trade school time comes. Aw, shucks  speechless people like can't weigh temporary needs epidemic hundreds thousands people dying.

It established law since many centuries restrict freedom epidemics, release afterwards, worked many times. *And people lived/died like healthcare system.* Sales trips nothing excuses get wasted cheat spouse company dime. largely artifact past. Yay! Okay we’ll see happens. think sides valid arguments. shit doesn’t hit ceiling think timeline realistic hangups happen like said know happen take longer also realistic. That’s take current moment  Oof. imagine analysis look like post-covid, even vaccine distributed completely. going take years people comfortable traveling again, that's accounting companies realized much done virtually/without traveling before. 

It'll better environmentally, financially going bloodbath. Supply shorted, hardly able mandate mask production reduced work force. China typically things stock 1. producers medical equipment medicine. 2. disease control much strict QOL kinda crappy rural china leading lots disease. mean Covid-19 originated TBD reason. 

The CCP scary control citizens news comes out, also likely images shown us. actual reality. well speculation. Also, tourism ads. Send us help. 
*cries South Dakovid* Ok, boomer.  line thinking got us deep shit. feel like people smart enough kick start whole country would understand difference temporary federal intervention public health safety vs. something actually tyrannical like Patriot Act. mean tell we've able communicate dang computers whole time?! Indeed. Support local satanic temple.  “All know ... “  balances checks? even everyone California obey, make difference unless state closed borders 49 states. Anything less consistent nationwide regulations doomed failure Boohoo happy could cry. Hopefully die this. deserves long, miserable covid never recovers from. Sadly, feel we're far gone. point, virus run course, hope vaccine gets sooner rather later.

Even families experienced loss first hand STILL shaken point awakening seriousness virus. continue stand beliefs, skewed are.

I feel 350,000 deaths 1 year mark US real scary possibility. sure isn’t conservatives won’t follow them? ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ Sure strip States power emergency never give back. That's exactly everyone sub gonna do. Even 1 case enough total lockdown. don’t understand people love going Disney much? 

I went feet hurt walking day (flat feet). wanted GTFO asap.

I don’t understand people keep going multiple times??? Makes sense, thanks. Brits fun words :) shown task force meeting five months, confirmed administration. even know spends time day. (I imagine watching tv) Lol supported lockdowns, Aus federal government exact opposite. don’t get this. Get married privately. party later. think ok receptions parties - even couple married year. Thank goodness USA development vaccines... sure countries haven’t made much progress vaccine research like suddenly needed walker, right? work international hub well tell said utter bullshit. know tsa officers dropping like flies getting covid. deal passengers tsa officers IMPROPERLY wearing mask nose mouth daily basis. reprimands managers supervisors wearing mask improperly. Half people coming airport working tsa taking seriously. Working airport fucking nightmare right now.

 24/7 sanitation teams theater best. 2022!? That's pretty irresponsible, try 2030 EARLIEST. Also can't train people nurse doctor 2 months Specifically, German government cash. good it. Yup. sad. feel like work zoo. students wear masks better teachers...simply take aside they're eating. taught keep do. drama. 

My coworkers remove almost religiously students classrooms, even around several teachers. take six foot CDC guidelines literally. Many also fond lowering talk, tee-shirt's worth cloth renders inaudible. nuts.

Oh, multiple wedding-hopping indoor socializing coworkers. Looking Facebook, think they'd found time machines back 2019, gotten early access Moderna vaccine. realize USA best job vaccines right Gosh.. happy blocked guy it’s holiday season general, Mother’s Day. one hits hard every year. first baby due April, hopefully I’ll focused new mom remember Mother’s Day year. 

Sorry loss well ❤️ lol reddit bubble, mask mandates actually think people going listen scientists America 2020 incredibly naive thing Calgary Vancouver international airports Lockdowns inevitable. doesn’t fit narrative. opposed lockdowns. Whitmer listen science? science behind banning jetski use? Fauci law expert. see reason ideas constitutional.  He's suggesting states take action time. follow playbook dealing situation in. well coordinated testing later vaccine plans. White House coronavirus task force bluntly stated latest weekly report ***""now aggressive, unrelenting, expanding broad community spread across country, reaching counties, without evidence improvement rather, deterioration.""*** Damn y’all really believing everything internet huh? Even random redditor. wonder scared shitless flu. Haha God damn thought vaccine sad thing think they’re actually accomplishing something. Europe USA terrible job pandemic Easy say. final got female strike taking payments might get government anything since that's indirect pressure leadership top good idea? talking lol. argued whole thread reinfection rate real concern like 50 confirmed cases worldwide. research again? LOL yup, confirm -- high school did.. lol holy shit guys. Welcome January. Let's get work. heh bruh there's interpreter signing right next Yeah, pretty bad get better numbers come enough trade shows reopen international travel return. Even might improve. U.S. Food Drug Administration issued emergency use authorization (EUA) first COVID-19 diagnostic test self-testing home provides rapid results.

Funny. explained confusing federalism republicanism, downvoted right-wingers. that's different! reasons! Europe fucked though good leadership “must worn outdoors times” it’s been. Diabetes also seeming result virus individuals well. Yes people dishonest quarantine, maybe feel like would shamed (rightfully so). opinion theres nothing important cant instead put safety first, obviously privileged for. believe genuinely careful, sanitary, quarantined monitoring vitals small gathering people behaving holidays. Maybe half were!  
I come Ukraine. say Ukraine weak. Totally, took time without pay 5 months covid first hit great home much. Parents, let kids grow pilots. Maxing card buy toilet paper Maybe he/she racist see racism around them, grew still live find racism everywhere it’s accurate symptomatic one leaving home symptoms. Isn’t whole point wanting rapid tests try preventative testing it’s pretty inaccurate? 

What truly asymptomatic cases?  people downvoted understand immune system, mRNA, adenovirus vaccines work. work Fortune 100 company asked video call. takes much bandwidth. Works me! one wants see pajamas makeup! It’s expected company able supply U.S. enough vaccine 2020 vaccinated 20 million people.

Wow. Truly amazing. ""plan"" US ""do nothing, go herd immunity, hope vaccine saves us"". Saying ""local control bad"" missing critical context, specifically, what's controlled. Depending context statement true false. pandemic, need coordinated response. I'm suggesting rules need applied states, kind coordination need happen national level. misunderstanding purpose. people claiming medical exemptions want wear mask. Wearing faceshield ""worse"" mask eyes almost nobody wears one. Providing faceshields gets people wear mask even believe solely want wear shield.  part? accept it’s real, don’t care anymore quarantining summer..I tried, nothing improved Lol. fun finding money, manpower, unified incentive that.  Bridezilla care gets sick. Bridezilla wants fun moment, get good instagram pics. Consequences people worry later. Divided States America. Today, walmart small selection TP, bounty paper towels, great value disinfecting wipes. Much disappointment replaced disposable mask section massage chairs look like car seats. guess hoarding masks 400 employees blocking aisles pretending stock shelves. 

Ah well got couple hundred rolls TP saved up. going wait TP really hard come people improvise, go TP anti-maskers houses it. caused China? I’ve seen evidence man eating bat mutated form Stockholm Syndrome happening US. COVID testing isn’t accurate. Besides, good luck timing right accurate results. They'll throw disaster money wall street This...sounds kind unrealistic. hope works advertised. I'd even say global response. bad situation Ohio definitely surprise one person already positive wedding. too! I’m going London. France's 7 day moving average deaths/day 582

US 1188 true Plenty amazing people swear.. look entire continent Australia. correct answer nobody seems understand. fact much division disagreement lockdowns masks means matter anybody does, isn’t going away. Doesn’t matter Biden somehow pushed kind national lockdown, enough people disobey point unable “shut virus” whatever moronic shit said. It’s working great, you’re virus.  mean. 

this guy tried blame tremendously failure handling virus right ? now, 1 year after, jump say ""eh maybe countries eeh"" 

way go faucet numbers iffy. I’m sure infections El Pasoans people treated city. Hospitalizations sure include people Culbertson Hudspeth counties Texas, Dona Ana Otero County New Mexico. also includes soldiers Ft Bliss (they ran hospital room long city did) Mexican Nationals may fallen ill side border. infected numbers city may also include groups Ha! Love job isn’t positivity hope. job guide inform. And, politicized administration didn’t want bothered Coronavirus swept rug big hide. Fauci tried right get us right direction fighting current moment went agenda. depends famous celebrity Huge drop. 7 day average 26k.  first post could fine reddit COVID-19, dated 3 Jan 2020: more: news article dated 08/01/2020 exactly see many. person suing would burden proof stating got virus *from wedding.*

Even 82 people attended wedding got infected, still circumstantial. fact countries going another lockdown sign learning they’re daily cases hundreds low thousands. US 150,000+ cases. 

They same.  “What supposed do? Vote Democrat?” makes sense. You’ve sound arguments far cities higher population centers.

The scientific study surgical masks surgery see correlation surgical masks pandemic made I’m sure one make correlation. said that’s probably N95 mask recommended. end day quote first article spot on, “Erika Mailman revealed article clear: problem public trust public health. Americans, now, like told do.”
When posed options common good go back fish pond example. village population 5 people pond every day produces 5 new fish. It’s common good take 1.
Our common good scenario wear mask, social distance avoid mass gatherings.
Don’t get wrong 26 year old upset normal life got turned upset down. fighting virus needs host live. deny host, life get back normal new normal sooner. He's got feeling! That's basically hunch! categorically false. Cases Texas actually declined first two months restaurants reopened (back beginning May). They’re spiking, since everything open ages would utterly unsupportable fact claim correlation reopening. Meanwhile, states like California saw earlier spikes May amidst strictest lockdowns. It’s convenient pretend cases strongly correlate lockdowns, isn’t supported data. data show however masks work, states strict mask policies done better, even essentially fully reopened. Thanks this, appreciate :) I'm curious; would happen know let immunocompromised people participate trial? assume wouldnt wan't symptoms pre-existing condition seem like reactions vaccine? They're common. Deployment rural areas problem. Deployment rural countries... probably happen article says it’s much higher. think discrepancy would test everyone know sure. people asymptomatic don’t get tested. Well, looks senate seat grabs soon worst. Gummy chewy. I'd literally rather cat food. prison convict crime? believe you, understand how. Taiwanese here, asian Seriously though Ahh yes, risk/reward ratio.. meshes nicely concept cost/benefit analysis.

These basic concepts, obvious judicious mind, completely lost many... Unfortunately. Agreed. People keep mind Belgium insanely high population density Belgian culture strong distrust authority baked - course going difficult contain spread there. someone dies invite funeral playback recording statement. think half population would agree vaccination? Sounds like big money spinner! serious viruses past never vaccinated short order? 95% effective, we'll see l suppose:-) Unless guy changed opinion last 3 days election, voted Trump. he's coming trying pretend like he's sort enlightened centrist literally voted he's complaining about. bravery, dishonesty cowardice. preppers know protesting lockdown order early April whining new shelter place order, still feel ok side-eying them. Also virus pervasive, makes trials go faster. Imagine virus like 1000 people got year, randomly. would take forever trial basically one gets it. 150 million people whatever (I know 55 confirmed, really way more) getting makes way easier test see vaccine works. *According company’s website, test “intended cost less $50” manufactured U.S.* 10th Amendment. health issue thus left States decide deal it–so even *was* national mandate (which be, regardless), states forced follow and, indeed, many (looking southern states!). That's way country works; always ""disjointed"" state-by-state approach comes issues fall 10th Amendment, that's whole idea. disease noticed Wuhan doctor (Zhang Jixian) 26th December reported 31st Dec, 2019

To circulate false narrative (2 months censoring 14th Jan, 2020), least learn basic arithmetics competent education system. People talking US many doses getting. I'm assuming 40 million doses top what's manufactured countries, say European countries? mine husband’s first thought is: he’s covid positive! I'm anti vaccine, someone tell treat vaccine like treat Windows Update (delay long possible wait bugfixes road safely using last)? share patience. COVID surging care anymore. following guidelines also travel Holidays. get 10x worse care 10 months. new president restart clock change willing give control this.

Eventually, vaccine get things back control expect heavy price pay meantime cases/fatalities. longer vaccine takes distribute cases deaths follow. Wow, November... topic would say Windows bad person using it, saying Unix/linux user. whoa. either. changes reddit completely. sarcasm either lol. theory rotate too, nobody keeps track (I don’t care. sho I’m told)

I think setting seperate non-holidays meet would ideal proactivity complacency &amp; denial 

what ever do, dont read Facebook comments 7 News Facebook page reported this. paying much attention news winter, February aware things bad China much that. yeah, think ""this America"" mentality going well.

I live Seattle area. Around end February, went trip days.

While away, first big US outbreak happened nursing home suburbs. got back, toilet paper, cleaning supplies, food flying grocery store shelves. Parents pulling children school major employers starting people work home; government stay-at-home orders came week two later. military came set field hospital local football stadium. News going stay open got bleaker every day. one point starting wonder supply chains food gas going break down.

Thankfully, field hospital see patients. death rate bad we'd assumed (based happening Italy), stay-at-home orders supposed do, hospitals overflow. (Let's see stays way now!)

But saw Moderna recruiting vaccine trial participants back March. participated, signing something like two shots month apart plus fourteen months periodic followup doctors' appointments. saw that, figured going least year half this.... almost fell that, figured, nah. I'm getting thing soon comes age group (which I'm anticipating gonna while, unfortunately).

To people say, me! Federal govt Australia lamented endlessly states started closing borders. would love nothing borders open ""protect"" sacred cow economy. Instead states took heavy handed approach paid off. Putin Stays Winning! Everyone constitution. gets changed amended times, sacred text even adapt sometimes. approve stupid message^, unfortunately 73+ million people like What! No, air travel sucks. work airline used see miserable tired guys were. Crammed in, stupid tsa, exhausting time get airport, lonely hotel rooms, expensive airport food. literally saw adult men arguing middle seat arm rest awkward watching uncomfortable people were. hope people don’t want travel work 3 times used dumb thing say. wish sarcasm ultimately right deleted almost posts chinaflu, here's image might times. Oh yes, bars fucking religion State. Every town WI bar church matter small. also backed powerful lobby group heavily influence policy State level. 

I’m state originally still sort baffled locations bars. Honest god least 3 think neighborhood middle residential block, even Main Street mind you, indistinguishable surrounding houses (other sign) operating bar. heard called “old man bars” I’m sure group crusty dudes frequent place. think they’re inherently evil people. enough members evil mindset convince instead good people. also automatically get downvoted reasonably factually point anything suggests vaccine rollout take longer optimistic projections. Remember people thought Oxford vaccine would available election? Pointing impossible got downvoted numerous times. I’ve seen posts Pfizer Moderna vaccines. That's feel.

I refuse even buy cloth ""cool"" masks designs. stick disposable paper ones. Something turning something needed survive pandemic fashion statement sit well me. though... whatever makes people comfortable. Nov 17 USA China? can’t imagine trying stay away people Tokyo. It’s like physical impossibility. Well, tell boss get golf course stop tweeting like 14yr old girl. Well, shit Sherlock. Lmaooooo #WOW SHIT Absolutely. US end catastrophically worse France end. rate, could end seeing 4-5k deaths day December/January. moment, deaths equal per capita, US would 2500 per day. soon, friend, right now. Wrong thread, think meaning /r/UpliftingNews Please elaborate hahaha, handle people screaming employer though hahaha. question, say older celebrity needs go hospital coronavirus, younger person needs go time. There's room one them. still choose younger person older mega famous celebrity? watch FOXNEWS.  Alarm sounding good reason... ok athletes policy others? It’s hard listen. one understand talking oxygen saturation levels women yelling weakly help.....help.....I don’t need understand Polish. understand trauma. crazy. feels like ages ago scariest part. Seeing threads stating people getting sick without Wuhan, knew know now. Incredible happen 10 months Oh, definitely struggle times. leading kids active singing dancing, get bit short breath. situation, I'd probably buy bullhorn, ha. Stay safe! Well duh. whole world Fauci figured out? Dumbass mean struggling compare position Trumps. Relative Trump supportive, general would say wanted open way fast early

If feds control would pretty shitty position visitors 2 months, 1 switch outs, 1 time could switch people. Yeah man, hear you. It’s like annoying smoke alarms. Yes, know house fire, it’s fire 30 minutes, let sleep already. it. went wary vaccine something resembling excitement, literally. united approach United States?? way! 9 years next mystery virus China pops right back again. Joy. Woo tested positive last week! close making it. making people listen. giving tools need do. resources survive without work temporarily.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Asking right questions here. I’m sorry republicans shitty people.  what's wrong that? Yes, like Americans honestly look them. Oh wahhhh poor Americans, said mean things Americans done nothing ruin world wars garbage selfish anti-intellectual people planet. Yes, hate America honestly last years hate grown Americans people. Cause clear reason country mess people mess.

Well maybe something shitty one's run show crying loud. biggest thing noticed Northeast got absolutely hammered beginning. one else took hint. I'll wear grocery stores especially planes forever everything else normal. Lol. mean wilfully deaf Doctors, nurses, ,hospital support staff --- folks getting crushed every day covid trump virus --- ever wish ignorant trump cult never happened? support cult ? - support Republican response pandemic -- stfu get back work , shits gonna get worse trap! fauci trying turn us china! tell Trudeau (Canada). aren’t poorly southern neighbours, shit went rough week really need coordinated response. not. brilliant. partner need vacation 500 sq foot apartment. wish hotels would here! deaths per million (3.4) right line East/Southeast Asian Korea: 9.6

Japan: 14.9

Malaysia: 9.8

Thailand: 0.9

Vietnam: 0.4

Taiwan: 0.3

They also enacted far hardest strictest lockdown world they've basically resumed normal life without healthcare system absolutely overrun, see compelling reason doubt numbers. wear one. really helps make sure people stand away you. Hahah could, science purge sorts. science still looks even though turned backs rest us. don’t blame you. think many us second guessing career paths right now, there’s pesky student loans issue. caught Covid *in* nursing school. Barely made through. Remember crazy PPE shortage? Whelp...

All stuff infection control learned definitely window large degree. It’s shocking. believed said. father law got fever flu like symptoms got flu shot. it’s pretty normal incredibly worth it. husbands boss.. wife tested positive. Husbands boss didn’t tell **his** boss today. Grammar problem, boss’ bosses?

And boss looks like weird word! lol live America. thankfully border closed America stupid disease carrying Americans come fuck country. grateful assistance toilet paper things?

I see food 

I see cleaning products 

Hell, see ammo.

But toilet paper? roommate tested covid last week aware tested 4 days fact results came positive. 

I'm currently work symptoms, awaiting test results come back next couple days. 

I'm hoping lack symptoms sign asymptomatic carrier, seek hospital care next weeks. hand, I'm worried test comes back negative, coworker received false-positive result I'm work nothing. left-over virus surface. cleaner even contact returning Australian.  get one 1/20/21 quote ...

“The CDC’s website states “the body evidence growing children ages susceptible SARS-CoV-2 infection contrary early reports might play role transmission.” 

The website also acknowledges “teachers students close contact much day, schools become place respiratory diseases like COVID-19 quickly spread.” People care national security personal safety, results regulations. lol positivity there? rising positivity rate. Literally America done ONE SINGLE correct thing whole damn pandemic. Like nothing. makes think anything going forward work? He’s thin, probably fine. Same, husbands mom going blow gasket can’t send us masks every chance gets (grateful also constant reminder shitstorm really don’t need 20 them...) Hard enforce country. People sensitive freedom  choose get experimental vaccine. EUA full approval, plenty docs rightly decide wait data getting it. I’m buddy, turkey Oh, got it. young professional living home (loving) parents moment WFH rent, defaulted flipping roles! [archive link anyone trouble accessing article  Canada. county that's wave, even near shit America. America one worst countries planet. old state (ID) pretending virus. new state (OR) freeze starting tomorrow.

You could drive literally 5 minutes Fruitland Ontario experience completely different response. analogy quite work here. harder lockdowns, yet still people died? makes sense. Oh. Boo hoo. actually someone tell almost exact thing. hospitals really getting bogged coronavirus cases, beds filled people getting paid hospitals get paid Covid diagnosis. Also, doctors nurses selling drugs, masks, etc Black market supposed used Covid cases. People actually believe kind crap. spontaneous election celebrations probably didn’t help either. agree anymore crowds bit?  Sadly job experience prisoners gain makes difference. won’t get job get out. Prisoners helped fight many large wildfires get eligible hired crew fought fires with. ever heard saying better safe sorry?  Gobble gobble.  [Judge Wolff considering closing bars reach 10% two honestly believe we’d get back sort normal, even everyone masked distance perfectly followed “rules” (like kids) letter without vaccine? Seems bit gaslighting.

Telling people need mitigation there’s vaccine saying months later - actually vaccine isn’t gonna end mitigation - worst PR ever seen.

Also get really sick hearing use qualification “some degree normality” - asked getting back normal. interviewers never push back “some degree” means him. That’s kind stuff I’m talking about. Thank much taking time answer good way. 

I even think proteins persisting body embedding cells, yes may concern great explained well.

My concern mainly immune system would somehow recognize cells produced spike proteins, (which lead immune system creating anitbodies), ""somehow corrupt"".

Again may totally naive me, since immune system attacks cells ""turn bad"", like cancer cells example, thinking might remember cells produced spike protein ""corrupted cells"".

Maybe that's exactly happens, perfectly fine since many cells anyway new ones produced every day? 

As said though really seems little information stuff, surface stuff get MSM. 

I really hope Pfizer Moderna great ""marketing team"" produce surface information, also answer in-depth questions, really improve confidence uptake. 

I think becomes especially true people who've vaccine get really sick day two, start tweeting it...and people get scared understand perfectly ok normal reaction immune system gets work learns what's going on.

Sorry sidetracked, want know really appreciate in-depth answer. people like we'll anti-vaccers 99% uptake vaccine. 🤗 Unfortunately, he’ll probably taking top-tier ICU bed paid got tax payers, own. cant indirectly compare relative effectiveness determine statistically significant, would need head head comparison. Id say may clinically significant difference, anything  earliest posts subreddit called r/China_Flu, subreddit even members time late January/early February.

I made post early days confirming second third generation one comments saved time.  someone knew pa 2 friends roommates could work home permanently initial lockdown. literally broke lease relocated Florida may simply less restrictions. can't wait day man's dreams realistic chance becoming reality. day influences policy, instead trying educate toddler can't punish.  Here, use mine 🎻 TSA says airline passengers wear cloth face coverings waiting line security screening. **Travelers must still briefly lower masks order TSA officer verify identity,** stay protected throughout rest process.

Do realize much attitude TSOs put travelers? deserved reaction. way comparison, 35-45 year old US, annual risk dying auto collision similar accident significantly overestimates risk dying infection, doesn’t count cases aren’t formally diagnosed (which overwhelming majority COVID infections).

Irrelevant. I've sick flu. want get sick flu like illness. sucks, even though never threatened life. agree wholeheartedly. Fighting virus something cohesive, national strategy rather piecemeal state-by-state approach. can't wait economy picks things go back normal. know necessary, mask annoying af. still wear them, person glasses, total nightmare. think morphing, factors play here, like sunlight reduces vitamin levels reduces immune response. Also direct sunlight kills virus coughing somebody outside middle summer, less virus get winter. coronaviruses show rather massive spikes winter periods. doubtful goes kids adults it, I'd assume approved point Yep positivity rate hit 10% 1% 300 million still 3 million. never WINNING! retorts running max capacity. What’s real fun massive funerals Covid deaths. 134 cars roll past gate Friday one. Agreed, sadly. dollars working conditions well... Oh good, enjoy hellish side effects decades come Got lucky Target online order midnight launch day! Please dear god this. I’m depressed various reasons one COVID. country real response highly troubling. It’s depressing end sight stop talking ""journalists"" 5 minutes? That’ll it! People fined become infected super spreader events. needs negative consequences beyond getting Covid Covid enough scare people. Maybe money fines make difference. shit since COVID. Ikr. People can't seem go without party, even means potentially leading someone's death. Pathetic shocking true: people really dumb cases sure rare. reason handful confirmed reinfections following must true medical community admit reinfection. 
You get infected Covid.

You get tested

Your test sequenced 

You catch different strain Covid

You tested 

Your second test sequenced well.

Sequencing viral test simple costs moderate amount money.  normally done.
So times tests act gate restricting number people show reinfected. 
Even 40% odd percent people likely asymptomatic one infections. 
Every time someone says reinfection rare hear news last year head. different strains virus, one contagious tends become dominant geographic area. odds encountering second strain rather slim. 

No evidence person person spread.
No evidence spreads easily.
No evidence airborne transmission.
So forgive take claim chunk salt. 
It proven reinfection happen.

The rules applied cases almost guaranteed make rare. agree comment ""workers"", many reasons.

Ignoring though, right everybody absolutely swallows avalanche still.

They may like it, absolutely swallow it. 

I'm trying downplay inequality, wage gaps, anything like that. speaking reality situation. Financial support they’re closed. could use positive reinforcement too. 😉 Yes, please crank federal government’s control. hell state governments, need one gigantic federal government, wait no, WORLD government.  U.S. government.exe crashed He's good epidemiologist, know anything constitutional republic works. Tenth Amendment especially enlightening. federal government power expressly granted Constitution. powers fall states people. Biden said he'd call national lockdown mask order, admitted he'd actually work governors order get done. president actually authority issue orders directly. read tweets, yikes. moron. Exactly got health care surge hit [archive link anyone trouble accessing article don’t say man literally worked president. Good job. It’s novel virus. course goal post going moving. literally science virus! And, realize muzzled current administration part right? It’s hard hopeful literally trying everything bring attention away virus situation address all. Another reason goal post kept moving don’t believe anyone expected level misinformation misdirection taken place politicization pandemic far reaching effects would be.  love home state :) sales person, last thing want return normal amount client sites required flying out. don’t know single person team thinks that’s effective except one dinosaur boomer stuck ways. 

Meanwhile I’ve never sold much year actually time focus prospecting finding qualified prospects won’t waste week time even purchase. labour forced though. Blood eagle trade em easier. Wtf would need prescription?

They need make available everyone. 

Maybe test test daily. 

That would actually help stop covid positive people could self isolate. That’s fair expect oligarchy? disagreeing w/you, anyone believes virus literally exist must completely checked out. mean, put president hospital, (amazingly) deny -- exist?  worst best:

Group 1: Anti-masker/ hoax/just flu/freedom/etc. group: group never wears mask often try make excuses, use conspiracies, claim freedom choice( don't) wear mask, even become belligerent rather wear mask social distance. put 10x effort masking social distancing would actually take mask social distance.

Group 2: "" to"" crowd"": group often acts like children put mask required required. walk establishment see owner/staff wearing mask often ask ok wear well. last ones put mask going store first ones take off/down. Often wait actual store putting take hitting foyer. group also likely group wear nose pull parts store alone. act exactly like children trying get caught told.

Group 3: good intentions put lot thought crowd: group genuinely cares catching covid told want avoid catching someone making them. following guidelines (mostly) instructed tend often make poor decisions reduce effectiveness following guidelines. often include people bubble without knowing person's bubble trusting person honest it.

My mother group prime example went see 20 year old nieces house. niece strict parents currently rebel phase wear mask( though told wants christmas???). mom thought would ok long niece boyfriend stayed outside wore mask house. explain her, niece isnt house make safe. still contaminated. mom good intentions made poor choice put much higher risk.

Group 4: Serious guideline followers sometimes point beyond: group takes guidelines life death many us group catch it. Masks worn properly times. put long get building doors. Hand sanitizer far away use public bathrooms unless absolute emergency. follow one way aisles stores. try go busy times. careful bubble scold remove people violate rules. limit time outside house, use debit cards, pay pump, use delivery much possible. keep virus news best understand spreads apply lives keep safe. goal survive things return normal, try normal life middle health crisis.

My wife militant members group. 80 year old mother spends 2-3 days week house. socialization normally gets. going go brother's Thanksgiving. wife also take pretty seriously two bubble. However works mental health facility. Even though good PPE, makes higher risk. told mother goes brother's Thanksgiving, require quarantine 14 days allowed back bubble. disowned niece rebel stance favorite niece.

Sounds like average Saturday morning me. crazy. I’m surprised don’t hear reporting / invest kind testing.... tell much trends instead analyze many different data points. No, small part virus produced vaccine (the ""spike"" protein). Never point vaccine contain whole virus, even whole virus broken parts. COVID vaccines analogy might someone handed instructions build car bumper. run car? No... there's car, building car, there's instructions build car... instructions bumper.

You can't get influenza flu shot either. different type vaccine COVID one, viral particles gone process destroys ability replicate. extremely confident this.

Change date whatever you’d like. like see 7 days, often look last day mornings, 9 AM, past hour see potential new hot zones emerge next weeks. 

The average time search spikes happens morning. 

Sometimes see anomalies. States go ranked teens twenties suddenly pop top 5. example, past hour, New Hampshire holds #3 spot US searches. new. jumped up. holds stead overall trend next days shows increase search volume, expect see wave begin within next 2-3 weeks. sometimes state pop go back day even hour later. Strange one it’s 2 there. many searching symptoms 2 NH? knows. Give days watch volume trend lines.

This simple way see cases pop even explode least could weeks advance. 

Remember lags... someone feeling ill, search, go get tested, wait forever results, results come in, results reported. may good 2 weeks one case shows numbers. Sometimes more.

The lag almost providing false sense security some. think it’s spreading area, background idea many people around searching testing sites checking list symptoms Google search.

Look colors map. dark blues search volume match exactly cases growing. I’ve watching US turn blue top making way cold weather makes way down.

Anyway, good tool use crystal ball sorts. Pretty damn accurate. all, you’re looking real data - BS fed public since Jan. quotes:

In likelihood, first coronavirus vaccines begin rolling frontline workers vulnerable populations last days 2020, possibly early 2021.

By Memorial Day late May, possible everyone US wants shot access.

But even that, may take several months develop enough herd immunity vaccination make mass gatherings safe.

snip

First doses likely go four groups people: frontline healthcare workers, essential workers, people 65, preexisting conditions vulnerable severe COVID-19 infections. 

It's likely process begin winter, possibly early December 2020, January 2021.
 

In phase, 25 30 million Americans four high-priority groups could getting vaccinated every month, Moncef Slaoui, scientist charge US government's coronavirus vaccine drive, said recently White House.

By springtime, vaccines could rolling healthy members general public working front lines 

snip

""By time get December, January, February, March, April, hopefully able get people listed priority people,"" Fauci said. ""I would say starting April, May, June, July, get late spring early summer, people so-called general population, underlying conditions designations would make priority, could get them. mean April everybody going wanting vaccine priority group going get it. means starting point, would likely begin."" 

By Memorial Day 2021, many Americans likely access coronavirus vaccines, full coverage require one shot each

snp

Fauci told New York Times Tuesday ""at least 75%, hopefully close 80, 85%"" country would need vaccinated fall 2021, order get ""close degree normality."" 

""What would like see overwhelming majority people get vaccinated can, essentially, really crush outbreak,"" said. ""This going difficult task."" I'll give you. Check math. going get twice, FYI. single dose. Advanced age makes much greater HR obesity alone. Even COVID floating cesspools sickness. worry, hes going Walter Reed immediately. shit? Social media. See previous post. “I think almost half wedding guests gonna’ get sick,” Mikayla Bishop told station. “You're moment. fun. think COVID anymore.""

I just.....damn. needed one 11 months ago Yes, otherwise can’t save - we’re together. Sometimes wonder ""Holy shit way contagious thought?!"" course ""it common practice swiss citizens hold weddings, Oktoberfeste events"". \*It prevented!\* /s I'm sick shit, least world can't look America one failing anymore. Like fucks sake people can't take break selfish shit couple months, meanwhile people afraid go essential jobs! 'Fun' fact, Trump's grandpa migrated US late 19th century died spanish flu 1918.

No joke, check yourself. Ironically likely politically motivated feed other’s negative energy. I’m glad vicious cycle (with virus) hopefully stop short number months. convenient add constitution. essentially wealthy ensured catered event pandemics, civil unrest, etc... that's sure looks like wealthy fleeing back second homes Florida. 25 50 percent
Simple mafs Govid morals north dacota  Maybe getting trouble? Maybe? Canada serious bloody trouble spite knowledge resources avoid. We’ve lead time almost everywhere else world. It’s absolutely shameful good Fauci pointing out. use nicotine products. mild case covid. Doubt nicotine reason people get mild case. point, almost every kid America going lose entire year school. argue worth it, extremely serious consequence. Bay Area, bars restaurants open schools closed. screwed priorities.

Meanwhile private schools open various mitigation measures, you’re rich, kids get extra year school. course governor kids private school attending. Right? know holds up. Sounds bit farfetched.

It does, yeah, especially we've moved 'only Sweden vacations then' 'well, ski locally, too!' (which make sense Finn - seems like local skiing would similar sides gulf). 

If theory true, week 9 influence show elsewhere, too, right? Eg. able see places vacations fell date. we? would change distribution electors well though. 6 plus 8 slightly relaxed restrictions, said 6 easily turn more... 57k tests done 19 883 cases today.

Source - official Twitter Health Ministry. Anyone know anything Austin? best friend moved 2 weeks ago trying get come stay month (I live AZ evicted highly considering it). end February cases spreading Europe though. Mostly undetected almost testing.

People went skiing Italy even government saying, 50 miles away outbreak, cancel skiing trip.

But people returned infected, quarantined, contact traced know results.

One tested case covid-19 50 miles away days meant probably 50 people infected time testing. time test result came back news spread, 50 people could infected thousands...

Now way testing still every person testing positive, 3 10 remain hidden.

Overreacting precisely done. Lockdowns single cases, stop travel, quarantine case relatives closed facility. virus would stopped everyone would angry overreaction. millions would saved.
On top economy would quickly recovered. heard reporter say 10% masks at. Oh well. everyone tomorrow. fair, conservatives either evidenced Lincoln Project. Plus Cindy McCain's support might well reason Biden took Arizona. You’re wrong, horrible comparison. two similar nature all, perception tragedy highly personal cultural thing. Death isn’t factor, it’s way happens, causes it, happened.   Death long term side effect life. wish people would see this. There's nothing except date vs. R0 number look at. 80% deaths happened past 2 months.


ND plenty time warning examples country/globe. enough prepare respond what's happening them, chose to.  S\*\*t. People likely said thing Spanish flu did. Climate change different thing. crazy think arent returning precovid ways. Americans already tried covid still happening. Theres way wont doesnt. really moral grandstanding invests reducing co2 produces co2. would moral grandstanding carbon negative. reddit socialist base. Going get downvotes. Seriously. I'd putting mattress morally bankrupt enough this. kinda proving point. Excellent response  South Australia going six day lockdown. Right, karma reddit really important. Almost socialists losers blame capitalism complete failure life, fun failure :)  post removed cannot verify reliable source.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Ideally, could help publicize fact getting Covid grant lifetime immunity - get virus, once. people know twice, might likely take precautions themselves. wrong. find sources, way way off. Dolly Parton, Always Love You! ❣️🎶 immoral. Immunologist here. Got threatened ban mods saying near start pandemic hot topic ""immunity might last!""

We literally example 11 years ago exactly opposite. H1N1 partial immunity make huge difference decades initial infection, would COVID different.

Sure, know sure, know antibodies mean anything definitively. Especially IgG. People covid higher chance dying covid heart disease. Meh, I'll let guys first. I'm danger zone I'll wait fine tune it. health care, right now, close - already - collapsing.

PiS (ruling party) told doctors years ago - let go (to countries) since complained much.

Plot twist, did. Hi there! might want correct spelling ""morality"" ""mortality""- thanks reading- ☮ usually stories traded friend friend fact first time one contact somone covid got cold saying covid second time got real covid started saying got reinfected things like this...(usually..i believe small% vulnerable reinfection) way delays spread, stop it, despite clickbait headlines country area ""beating covid"" 

Delaying spread valid goal stop hospitals overwhelmed. Getting rid virus altogether realistic countries point, least there's vaccine. need control spread. mean, really. factor many fucking miles plane would never car. anything like ships, fuel used dirty fuck. thought Florida hopeless .0075% Americans died point, 1 every 1300. end next February, one year, one every thousand, sooner. easy check that, 248,000 330 million. Vaccine development vastly better different long ago.  I'm saying Nostradamus but...

You pretty accurate thread would advise anyone invest nice, capable home office quality microphone. 

This far important home theater F’n PS5. Even blows soon, next global disaster hits workplaces shutting down, you’re much flexible position maintain work options pursue distance education. Hah. chance hell. wedding four funerals. remake British 1994 rom-com new twist. I'm afraid of, heard death could long term side effect certain vaccines past. sure someone spreading false news though. Americans never cared lives lost 9/11. Americans cared using lives justify bigotry. covering ass sued Finn anyone got covid really care wearing one. bad environment. literally people using transport go faraway place stuff like go restaurants, visit museums, etc, stuff locals do, higher, concentrated intensity. solve transport part, make environmentally friendly. could invent planes powered electricity, possible cars possible planes one day. ships. could also phase plane travel favour train travel shorter distances, like European countries. Trust me, tourists actually like traveling air, huge hassle, travelling land much slower. High speed rail could change that. maybe even (gasp!) getting vacation days per year. people like three four weeks, understandable want waste 4 5 days trip getting there.

And completely wrong impact travel mind. Research shows experiences make people happier things. parents took many trips abroad kid, I'm definitely different person it, formative experiences. still remember trips vividly matter long ago they've been. Everyone knows countries exist, completely different go see yourself, many people travel unconsciously hold view country centre world everywhere else ""somewhere else"", they're unable detach point view. going different country, stand feels ""real"" home country, longer abstract concept. see people around look different, talk different, etc. effect. friend clearly logical reasoning needs confirmation? Many Victorians still believe security guard shagging Covid positive traveller.   April Trump wanted that, attacked accused acting like king left. AP fact checked criticize Trump: 

“The president un-declare national emergency declarations, freed federal funds provided assistance state local governments,” said Walter Dellinger, former acting U.S. solicitor general. “But federal statutory constitutional power override steps taken governors mayors state law. never understood lacks general power rule decree.”

The federal government broad constitutional authority states things cross state lines involve entire nation, regulating interstate commerce immigration, levying taxes declaring war. Trump proposing, however, different. wading states’ sharply defined powers protect public health.""

So ""disjointed"" state state approach probably remain. Everyone watch trailer ""songbird""... Much like NY, majority deaths happened early pandemic people knew best treat patients. rate nowhere close recent months. Thinking SA. Hope works 🤞 Fingers crossed Sydney Seems things finally going bit, deaths high least week. moderators set votes? That's hospital deaths, ton people dying home Yeah true. actually watched NYT summit today saw live. host asked thought business travel stay home would go back pre-covid times not. ""grandstanding"" MILITARY CONTRACTORS! FUCK YEAH! 

COMIN SLAY MOTHAFUCKIN DAY! Considering people dont wear masks around here, I'm surprised didnt change faster. Imo roll backs closures earlier, though. Ouch, sick burn Thanks Sturgis! Japan? Really? ""aggressive response"" joke compared European countries. measures soft slow pretty much impossible get tested unless die. They're even testing victims time file deaths pneumonia. managed avoid catastrophe population well disciplined comes public hygiene local strain less aggressive European one (or less aggressive Asians).

What China achieved impossible, requires closed borders, something every country world easily. Also, China low level spread sure, 0 community cases deaths utterly unrealistic country 1,5 billions. probably bullshit anyway. trust number right-wing states put out. way fatality rate WAYYYYY lower states resources deal pandemic. Smooches Gasp socialist That’s little ironic parents old sickly they’re choosing wedding pandemic massacring old sickly people. think reinfections much common. testing lot nowadays march. guess lot people asymptomatic didnt get tested. otherwise u smaller countries would track towards herd immunity. like belgium example. actual point trying make mumbo jumbo? Call airline? initial model assumed US superpower values human rights competent leadership. Turns US China Vastly underreported. mum says: it’s often cold outside winter. ... know advocating position? Considering deaths 1,200 day would near impossible get 400k end January. got called anti-masker conspiracy theorist suggesting Japan might hiding infection numbers,

But next mystery solve : little death. Even among senior communities. 

Easy guess would Japanese people typically much healthier western counterparts? self-employed support small business. go client's offices NYC frightening see many businesses require staff wear masks. walk around pandemic interacting customers. wear mask times protecting cannot afford service lose clients. Sending inspectors fining businesses time caught even nose sticking mask would go long way. fines significant enough force change. Otherwise, keep killing people lack compliance. also attacked Victoria opening up, slow closing borders, failed support international students Vic, failed support part arts industry, policies mentioned largely written Labor Greens (who doubt pushed much could greater financial support), Greg Hunt dude liability throughout this, Frydenburg seem understand economy start repairing covid dealt could go on....

Sorry assumed talking fed gov yes play important role (almost strictly financial ) bare minimum. wow Yall could shaken put ten colonies Mars. country built censorship propaganda can't handle pandemic, knew. Yes, Swedish antimaskers completely different breed people screaming ""take responsibility NOW!"" also saying ""masks work"". nothing ""muh freedom"" covid denial Sweden.

It comes health authorities stubbornly pursuing ""science weak"" ""doesn't seem work Spain etc etc"" tropes. I'm sure would start recommending masks would comply maybe late now. heard line many times pandemic “you live life”. cringe, hard every time somebody says this. Soon enough Dakotans need designate North South Dakotas America America world lol easy man unfortunately. one mental abuse, little way get help, mother afraid try leave, something might really go down. messy situation hard handle. eight months everyone saying hang groups, guys socialize like this? went eat several times? I’m really sorry friend brought group, omg. you’ve seen people week I’ve seen year mean asymptomatic? best country point fingers, since know bad get FWIW, White house was/is rapid tests. testing provided LA county PCR . Think people need go hospital non-covid reasons staying away getting help.

No one talks something isn’t necessary means one needs it?

You see that’s argument right now? great news bad news.

The great news Trump lost election getting kicked office January, one way another.

The bad news is: facts already show this, good reason believe new facts kind end Trump pretending won. reports shortages? Turns out, privatise hospitals reduce beds minimum cut costs, prepared major incident disease outbreak profitable. So, I'm supposed travel 2 days. Airlines asking negative COVID 19 PCR test results. made mistake took serological/antibody test idk strict it. think disallow boarding take different COVID test/serological Oh look it’s shitty IHME model Wow truly great! definitely fall 3rd category. take seriously, slipped going stores. forced go one vacation girlfriends family, don’t take seriously all. But, still haven’t eaten restaurant. live near Detroit, we’re lockdown again. hope helps slow virus crazy ass people also. Maybe ""benefit"" living next cluster world one point (Elmhurst Hospital) notice sirens, helicopters, freezer trucks, temporary tenting built outside hospitals. speaking others around city similar situation everywhere, mention horrifying posts friends worked inside hospitals. work “non believers”. Pretty astonishing really. Irony one thing- thinking Biden kind progressive jem real joke. 

I want president end pointless wars. Fuck anyone else, bunch fucking murderers pirates.

I'd voted happily Bernie, Ron Paul back day- complete opposite many ways, would take either meant brothers sisters could stop dying mineral deposits Afghanistan.

I want shit end MIC go away. point curfew suck maximum amount joy life without making greedy capitalists suffer absolutely necessary. site german equivalent ""The Onion"". article says federal chemtrail program used vaccinate anit-vaxxers. *laughs Tasmanian* can't think appropriate misery monster locked cage several bouts COVID-19 victoria, Australia effect mask wearing jumping 10% 99% one day next quite apparent case rates. went down, zero. 

So struggle understand argument. works virus isn’t everywhere. North Dakota could send spam email entire state saying quarantine exposed. Basically 14 day lockdown Isolate, get tested, make list people saw since saw infected person. take 5 days start show please stay isolated estimates daily diagnoses follow thanksgiving we’re already 150k day now? It’s always funny see people cope. Youre mad I’m successful like worse case rates cause harshest lockdowns. Light end tunnel would seem Patently untrue. Making 19 year old kids enforce government mandates os mot way.  find another doctor. jail something? /r/China_Flu IIRC  funny conservatives .. people pushing wars back (even though think dems would gone war too), ones believing conspiracy theories COVID now. Interesting times .. lol Lol....”in republican” ! wars 9/11 USA dignity population, corporations ... lol

Even war Afghanistan somehow important USA, war Iraq (We know Weapons Mass Destruction found Iraq Iraq nothing 9/11) oh well, USA go killing estimate least 1 million Iraqis somehow praise George Bush still respect .. lol made laugh hard. picture CDC staff keyboards wearing mittens. house plant jerk into

lmao Well let’s see Thanks. would assumption - distribution randomized, stat take account. maybe I’m missing something. downvotes, it’s often spirit sub - anything full embrace doom met snark assumptions must denier sort. mention Biontech actually develops vaccine Yeah North Jersey originally know ton people dad knows several people died know anyone died. people dad knows 70+ hangs with... takes two tango. Basically invite people people come. I've getting invites problem since coming. Nobody stopping getting bunch workers starting business Americans reporting in. strain offer cross strain immunity? Asking friends. Sorry hear that. also think shocking nature event triggered something lot people. Fake news? 


I wanna /s feel must. lock long enough, get back controllable level. still gathering data, supposedly something next week so. Orlando! It’s conventions much mouse makes Orlando’s $$$ Also way deaths North Jersey compared south.  Lmao read little bit randomly distributed deaths cluster age race social networks, distribution random.""&lt; learned disconnect eyes mouth expressions  started interesting little side thing February me. Little know... good overall experience. never modded before. handful active mods pretty tight knit now. There's lot mods list, majority mod anymore (which totally fine! volunteer). we're rhythm, easier. start, pandemonium coming wanted things run, leadership changes, etc etc. It’s battle big pharma  I'm sure thought made necessary precautions / rules getting around that. give coronavirus someone's vulnerable, making ill even killing them?! even talking strain healthcare system everyone pay for. flat implied others “blindly trusting” *you* “don’t think enough trials.”

You’re saying know better without explicitly saying it. I'm amazed that. think curious appropriately skeptical. Aside antivaxers skeptical wrong things, people even know vaccine worked, yet everyone skeptic armchair vaccinologist imperative get vaccine produced distributed ASAP. Yes, would good long term studies, enough hard data appropriately make risk reward calculation conclude infinitely better take vaccine now? Hell yeah! Even though first mRNA vaccine distributed, like researched since 90s. need trust body researches doctors working healthy amount skepticism, level changes based urgency product. One additional year going change safety profile, delay achieving vaccine mediated herd immunity. motto 2021. Hmmm, choose believe new strain weakening, speads much faster, like happens many viruses evolve. virus still strong, way virulent, sense spread even faster, big trouble. post history mess breast enlargement? actually love focus eyes person. You’re perfectly welcome stay home, unvaccinated, vaccine longer necessary.

If want anything puts close contact others, it’s body choice affecting. entire year seams weird off. Like virus real we're lied sides, left right. omw get vaccine. “They expect us wreckage brother”. freedom comes responsibility. responsibility properly educated encourage right thing do. Vaccination science isn’t belief opinion. It’s facts. get opinion plastic surgery, vaccinations. hard believe badly people think things through. bleat careful. men, would still COVID, would still downvote.

-- woman  think end result nationalized health care system. people realize insurance companies making absolute killing, even pandemic, see hospitals struggle funds understand system broken. tons those, unfortunately cancer specific biology person, cures work specific person, everyone else useless. Also Chemo cancer treatments solid attacks, lots people survive cancer... sucks do. funny beginning many people saying can't throw money vaccine development make go faster. ""99% individuals four 42% ten symptoms"" four months post-infection. done pandemic, fucked job. social life mental health, vaccine get it, I'm definitely gonna go back normal possible. Agreed. data statistical hypothesis strong immune response month two compared week two administering vaccine. 

Just wait till find meteorologists guess going rain Monday (nearly 5 DAYS AWAY) appreciate sarcasm got chuckle. I’m trying spread silly stories though, honest question end. rest background explain asking. I’m insisting anyone believe me, reason make anything up. 

If may offer better description...he got tested first time aunt brother positive. symptoms all. July. three negative month later. October mom sick didn’t feel right (not terrible normal). tested positive (no family members though). everyone fine. one needed hospitalized. wondered immunity thing worked. didn’t know sequencing. know enough learn jumping points. said, acknowledge disdain uncorroborated anecdotal stories apologize irritating today one (twice). understand short timeframe developed in. would supportive option defer studies done point needs cutoff. Religious excuse huge copout (for far many things). saying said flu vaccines barely work? true  Honestly, even capitalist members government damn good motivation get vaccine many people possible. capitalist economy can't flourish people spending people either can't afraid spend right now. continue case virus reaches levels low enough barely relevant news story anymore. I'm sure hold outs there, would expect spending pretty bipartisan effort. it'll least bipartisan enough overcome small republican majority senate. Absolutely, focusing unvaccinated part see drop would big enough go back normal Way step bare minimum DeWine! Side note, mask mandate hasn’t done anything either. Meijer counted (out loud passed bc I’m sick idiots) 21 people wearing masks, nose. Monday morning, even super busy time day. adding covid list things like MMR chicken pox mandatory vaccines.

I think lucky vaccine seen routine MMR. COVID politicized day one lot Americans think disease even exist. 

As time goes on, vaccines job, global risk falls, even easier kooks believe fake. suffering measles outbreaks due peoples' ignorance, measles even political.

If put money would say COVID vaccinations remain far controversial normal vaccine suite, indefinitely. least America.  April widely available. rolling high risk groups end year. Amen isn’t one random study. 

This study one piece evidence agrees pre-covid studies mask use, studies sub wants completely disregard. studies caused every scientific body world recommend mask usage stop respiratory viruses couple months ago. Thanks one people post Reddit actual result - inconclusive - rather implying shows masks work!

“The important limitation findings inconclusive.”

“Yet, findings inconclusive cannot definitively exclude 46% reduction 23% increase infection mask wearers setting.”

Limitations were:

“Inconclusive results, missing data, variable adherence, patient-reported findings home tests, blinding, assessment whether masks could decrease disease transmission mask wearers others.” right hope, personally don’t think go far. bet that. part sound frightening, agree 100 percent, hope mortality rate much lower, due evolving, like happens many viruses. people (almost everyone sub) understand probability overactive headline read.

Someone telling I'm grandma murderer second now. helps 59% Americans get vaccine. Many it. I’d like see actual data vaccine going “it’s safe.” October 1 US ran approximately 1 million tests. Today 1,500,000, 50% increase month. period, daily new cases went 45,400 155,000, 340% increase. Yes agree; similar least slightly higher. feel like something trumps obligations... seem like know lot, reason vaccines safe opposed treatments like benzodiazepines stress causing drug addictions. eyes seems like treatment meant easy way make money patients addicted drugs treatments like (maybe due corruption illegal means) escape testing someone confident vaccine without long term testing third parties? That's I'm thinking. ""common cold"" variety different infections. Four coronavirus strains. would hopefully still provide level resistance/immunity main Covid 19 creating havock. Maybe I'm overly optimistic though. Yup. part screw world. much shit going hatred towards everyone else. also volunteer help abuse victims, also can't lump spousal abuse child/teen abuse one. police definitely changed times hint abuse call help. perfect, allowing abuse happen "" hard otherwise"" people say "" business 
"" need stop archaic ideas handling abuse.  100%. right refuse something endanger people. swear, better see civil unrest this...  first, information. Moderna vaccine reach milestone. limited supplies probably choice while.

Both rna vaccines targeting spike protein. One requires much lower storage temperatures. Take look comments time. One top comments nurse talks long term symptoms. read comments lot people talk different changes health, taste serious issues like breathing. flatmate asymptomatic, couple months later difficulty breathing found lungs filled black liquid. petty things

I see petty thing. major deal. fact many people going continue visit family spite literal pandemic tell quite lot people see petty thing either. Absolutely! hope healthcare frontline workers get vaccine consider allowing teachers well. wife teacher provided safety equipment still class sizes 30 so... would relieve lot stress know didn’t worry much always laughed people thought would wearing masks decades come, permanently new normal mean. tell? anyone advice prevent goggles fogging wearing k-95 masks? like cloth mask, feel K-95 offer better protection (the ones authentic checked/validated tag website plus make approved CDC believe)... goggles labeled anti-fog... tried 3 different ones always end fogging. comfortable leaving house mask; cautions/nerdy type person want eyes protected well...

What fog... ? feel like could small face (chid sized) perhaps air seeping fogging way? tried adjust goggles; tried placing higher, lower etc still stay foggy? Would tape perhaps help? mean tape, taping top mask face less air seeps out?

The fogs makes almost can't see. read reviews Amazon goggles bought, reviewers said fog wearing mask... still fogs me! think smaller average person sure. Talk viral load!  means infected person starts shedding sooner, asymptomatic mildly sick realize shedding continue daily lives. means generation time virus accelerating severely restricts ability contact tracing multiple generations occurred person receives positive test investigated.

Its like wind picked fighting forest fire. Yes. They're mostly American politically driven. slowed alot election. Go back weeks nearly every day dominated comments either sea lioning, mocking precautions, whining rules strict/unnecessary. Dude that's 5th grade thesaurus best probably see much intelligence FB truth knower circle jerks. America country water-hosed sicced dogs peaceful protesters, bombed churches (one killed 4 little) girls assassinated every freedom fighter stood tyranny. 

There likely always Two Americas. Exactly. really doesn’t help, especially misinformation distrust going right now. What’s best guess reopens? Mine 3rd quarter 2021. shitty legalese vaccination world-wide pandemic. like meth head cooking unknown recipe mother's basement.  There's way they'd give single doses anyone purposefully, that's medically negligent. Well, certainty. flu vaccine couple weeks ago symptoms got. Went away one day. TANSTAAFL already hours restrictions place stepping up. mentioned comment, “or least solid attack” cancer. next election, Biden's going blamed it. unless n95 proper mask thought talking two specific dogs second some, SCOTUS. law land Incredible. barely remember now. they're also wrong one, they'll resort social distancing crap.   heavy underestimation - soon hospitals capacity across country - death rate skyrocket. really see controversial all. want anti-vaxxers could form city move see works them. Trump trying claim credit vaccine? reconsidering this? It’s good practice allow vaccinated people certain public places. role spread it. GOP government gets best COVID spread imaginable. stop wearing mask store workers stop wearing them. 17 cases far... Suggests actually good job finding compromises. sides equally annoyed. 

At end day, spread happening mostly everyone parties get togethers other’s houses.  Short declaring martial law activating national guard police streets haul people front military tribunals, there’s much actually stop this. aren’t going stop it, destroy bunch businesses reason? Better put teeth enforcing existing rules shut repeat offenders.

Gyms seem issue lot people site. friends go climbing gym. gym enforces 100% mask use, tightly regulates capacity, modified bunch practices, spending ton sanitation. haven’t close due outbreak. close la fitness outbreaks? say teacher right kids parents better really appreciate asses even Teacher Appreciation Day next May. Duh. This. Short miracle, think Jan horrific. DeWine weirdest things swear god. I’ll follow know lot people won’t it’s gonna turn upside us. unconstitutional illegal, actually. Declare state emergency, fine everyone follow rules state emergency. Perfectly legal, perfectly constitutional. 

Look, pandemic started used d0\_\_0mer (censored word) afraid it, live already spent 5 months hard lockdown, 7th deaths per million world, still honestly rather die honestly think deserve virus specie reading news 17 million minks exterminated Denmark. know immunity natural infection, none mutations far proven vaccine escapes. Print this, keep file take need go hospital. (Hopefully, happen, course.) Make doctor read it. talk prescriptions. I'd this, even meeting one person, feel high risk. point connecting someone giving temptation see person know feel comfortable touching them. times I've seen friends since March sporadic distanced outdoor interactions. sound like hot date me. **Nov. 18, 00:00 (UTC+9)**

To paid attention, far crazy thing time absolute zero questions, media outlet, asking CDC's single digit daily tests. Um, yes, would like reserve “spankatorium room” weekend. brave Wait. people think virus hoax people think vaccine hoax. doesn’t make sense.  deaths caused lockdowns? Increased suicides, mental illness, delayed treatment, overdoses, etc? Thoughts prayers sure... Interesting see things look like hospital couple weeks. said wrong, correct. US federation, like EU. EU unified response like US. Glad crown anymore.  get dude help? many people outside 10? go 9? TV coverage moving. obviously caring doctor. Sounds like time find beds taken anti-maskers. hilarious scary you’d like force others. Eh, common we're trying good ol' fashioned fuck USA thread :) fuck happening y'all idea biden talked about

Yeah, know laws happen Congress thats Biden elected into. Shocking, know.

Stop screaming adults understand system.  Fuck Fauci. Reddit psedeo intellectual website is

So many people full saying never returning back normal even though thats exactly happened deadlier spanish flu 1920s times Anyone know results come out? I’m Oxford trial wanna know vaccine placebo think take time goes negligible levels also think restrictions slowly tapered down. Finally mass events, conferences exc. probably take another months need level pre organizing done 100% positive restrictions ending. Wait... contact tracing senate? 
How could Republican controlled senate calls virus hoax/flu? 
They seem lot things Americans don’t access too. 
He speaking floor Monday senate present exposed. 
It’s like science experiment. Dems wore masks Reps didn’t.
Let’s see catches next... 
That’s truly positive &amp; it’s another senator lie gain sympathy. ""i take responsibility all""  literally shut schools flu gets bad. remember happening kid 80s 90s teacher early 2010s. COVID many orders magnitude risky travel. even close. say don’t care. say I’m responsible health people see risk groups clearly decide responsible Idk man...telling people inject bleach seems like joke material. also refused let doctors talking. provided medical advice things knew nothing about. retired 2018 election cycle (Mitt Romney elected open seat). Unlikely. Unless Dems win Georgia's two seats Senate, changes composition SCOTUS, even political appetite expanding court soured lot face pressing problems, notably death thousand Americans every day due COVID sputtering economy. Name three branches government please. abroad husband supposed visit April. late February program temporarily suspended, March 3rd back home. visit April, he's left town birthday.  Since business class passengers often end ""subsidizing"" economy class, mean airfares go up, Gates said holds true? Ok yes checks balances important system checks balances also become gridlocked incapable functioning. That’s seeing now. “The party local government control” what's point? people die big deal? also, least anecdotally, MS took skype forced OS, people got mad another program running need. think people fatigued point, human nature crave normalcy companionship. Maybe figured time fourth line... probably want person stick around power long anyway mean Flu vaccines *still* effective year time actually this. It’s almost day.

Just little sentence keep hearing everyone kills inside, great news vaccines finally coming boring statement reality.  Paxton said today must never shut Texas again.

Our government sucks. Thanks! probably got one, sure good two earlier though... Every comment thread purely political! I'm sure comment removed said, must beena doozy.

Everyone loves constantly talk anti-maskers, yes, they're incomprehensively, abhorrently stupid, spread country world many people let guard consider circumstances family/friends special. Period. donor would imply expecting anything back. call draconian? Well let's compare NZ Hawaii shall we! forgot add important factor USA...incompetent leaders It’s funny people equate pandemic response Russia Russians would rather us die pandemic Well, kinda did. eyes president. Lot ppl like sub dude effective that’s rule everyone ignores it. course is, unfortunately. Transportation vaccine, storage, people priority list, vaccination dates etc etc. Could take month people start getting vaccinated. That's claim. Maybe faster that. support point, Australia ranks 192nd 194 population density, 3 people per square kilometre average, yet would rank 20th urbanization, 89% country living urbanized. Population density means absolutely nothing.

Its like live farms. live, quite densely packed. live many places. 40% population live two biggest cities alone. I’m imagining someone responding well don’t know thousand people average person still doesn’t know anyone succumbed yet, well. Ugh we’re fucked vaccines… ‘The research, published online, peer-reviewed published scientific journal. comprehensive long-ranging study immune memory coronavirus date.’ Later says 185 participants frankly I’m sure NY Times thinks reliable thing put print.

You dragging ass figure people covid, especially people prison chance getting well ventilated spaces.

Man dumb thing say. Edit: towers survival rate might great odds. people (such elderly) survival rate catch great. need many people possible vaccinated -because vaccination guarantee...some people vaccinated still get virus. people vaccinated medical reasons.

You're tied sofa. Yeah true compared slow first couple months felt wouldn’t surprise someone said turned many pages calendar really September. think I’m fucking stupid understand phrase, explain it? U.S. government claim clue actual quarantine would work. idea. Lol. America trouble then. Yikes. So, one threatening? virus kills millions kids virus kills millions people life expectancy?

The former, course.

Now explain get proposition “The number actually looking number people died Covid would die anyway year two”? follow point death person simply disregarded, proposition implies. It’s won’t. big retailers canceled it, others probably smaller version usually do. Amazing - feels like end well truly sight. remaining question get dose?

When assume people walk past street dose? women supposed fundamentalist religious Christians southern states. Stay home cook clean make babies go church. need 70+% take vaccine effective achieving herd immunity. It’s upsetting. end 2017 mom passed away pretty grueling cancer battle. Initially went cardiac arrest lost oxygen period time. put ventilator. Somehow, woke still person. never left hospital condition worsened November December put palliative care. Somehow managed see positive woke initially least weeks see inevitable passing. even brought pug visit her.

I bring stepdad brother downplay pandemic. suffered watching mom go onto ventilator, ultimately could breath end. least got aware large portion time. It’s like forgot war mom endured.

Today, people get see loved ones hospitals get overwhelmed preventable deaths occur. never thought would say relieved mom died did, things think am. series events occurred today don’t think would able see would died alone thinking one cared. depression extreme anxiety. 

Needless say, made decision engage anyone enabling pandemic. includes family. willing endanger innocent people simply refusing wear masks. cant really defend it. title outright says ""couch potatoes"". Nobody “checks in” hospital case. It’s hotel. I’m going enjoy dancing grave “new normal” narrative antisocials peddling. ‘The CDC’s website states “the body evidence growing children ages susceptible SARS-CoV-2 infection contrary early reports might play role transmission.” ‘. Wow, wow. Anyone brain knew children massive spreaders. don’t get sick...ok, bring home others get sicker issues. Also, newsflash, children died this. Oh CDC disgraced. 30% german adults say refuse get vaccine So? 500k cases, unreported number said 5x-10x, would mean significant portion pop it. herd immunity debated strongly, saying kicks way earlier. cases one timers, covid would slowed earlier. cases increased 10.7% past 7 days, number tests increased 6.8% past 7 days, would mean % positive rate new normal crew wants safe effective vaccine.

This good news.

However, still looking fucking train wreck response moment, properly wear high quality mask distance because... checks notes... yes things seriously fucked right now.  country celebrated veterans day enjoys gun possession, seem see doctors nurses celebrated much, wearing masks (arguably weapon virus). isn’t highest figure world. It’s nearer 1 800 Belgium. 2.8 million Americans die anually w/o virus. care all? Correct. 40 countries Europe (36 better America) . USA way better Europe. 
That’s point Federal SOB needs sit quiet. State-by-state approach country designed work! It’s shady actually read process. 5-10% don’t mount good response. It’s minority it’s still thousands people.  Look certain point numbers stop going own.

Hopefully new shut beds/staffing. understand correctly, it’s qpcr test kit without thermocycler? Anybody know works? Owners company wife works antimasker COVID denier last week family members got it. refrain ""obviously masks work"". still want impeach governor.

They can't accept responsibility fact actions put family members risk must masks work shutting restaurants couple weeks devil. broader us closing 1 1000, too. Pretty sad.  many news human trash? forgotten now? read “China” “valuing human rights” context? Australian here. gladly say measures rhetoric politicians draconian.

WA Premier said prepared open borders states sustained periods 0 community transmission, slight risk contagion would detrimental **economy**. bad mother death bed Northern Territory, boss said economy important. No, Mr. big time leader made sure ridicule governors things right blame worsened economy. hands busy tweets hamberders. That’s silly doesn’t work. get two people trying shame other. 

And really wouldn’t assume shame someone hold majority opinion, may part problem aren’t realizing. 

All “shameful things” opinions held majority country. 

So really, it’s end “shamed”. like saying victim died due blood loss bullet inside. looks like new normal crew going another bad day people insist making weddings insist everyone take covid test days prior vefore attending? thats least would require president isn’t narcissist. don’t see contentious people estimatey number crunches comments. Look survival estimates parameter estimates. 

The estimated survival rate 0-19 99.997%. 
The estimated survival rate 20-49 99.98%
The estimated survival rate 50-69 99.5%
The estimated survival rate 70+ 94.6%. lockdown allowed outside home all, even take nights walk draconian me. thought Italian spanish ones allowed 1km home They're probably using different timezone, deaths RKI reports middle week less weekends. I'm stating told reporters press conference. Sort of.  I'm implying idleness devils playground. 

When bored protest anything. (And LA... will) lie. one lives North Dakota. Germany, would know changes virulence many months happened, vague CDC statement.

Germany ""CDC"". Robert Koch Institute actually Germany, would know that. players playing state played first senior game, i.e. state career originated.

Before 1982 first SOO held, lived given state played team. problem, Queensland professional clubs, Queensland players would move New South Wales play professionally end going home state. meant Queensland almost always lost inter-state games, journalists started calling series played state started out, ended up.

It's properly even competition, current result 22 Queensland wins 15 New South Wales wins two draws 1999 2002. I’d rather get quarterly boosters mean, kids get lot coronaviruses- pretty much every “common cold” stuffy/runny nose cough thing coronavirus I’m sure surprise here. interesting vaccine ends protecting common coronaviruses. De Might. May. Can. often incomplete latest 2 5 days

Which far cry statement ""Sweden two week lag reporting deaths compared countries"" reminds episode Star Trek: TNG... Lack medical help, cancelled operations fear going hospital. missed point. I'm saying chronic issues kill still devastate you, speaking experience. herd immunity crowd crossing fingers hoping virus long-term effects. watched news conference, secretary health hinted multiple times regulations start. asked multiple times would enforced, secretary said, “through honor system.” However, hinted things don’t improve, stricter measures would enacted. Something tells me, know won’t work, start somewhere. going sound terrible, rest Canada always high mighty Toronto, even COVID pretend Toronto worst place be.

And yet 78% Toronto’s ICUs use, amount actually lower time last year. many cities country way beyond Toronto’s per capita infection rates. hope it’s eventually noted people city better job peers way, healthcare system overwhelm ways right T.O.  I'm safety, damn, need vaccines now. Wish voluntary system people wanted take vaccine could. like forgot everything know respiratory viruses thing started.

I know!!!!!!! like I'm taking crazy pills. really eye opening heart breaking. I’d hard time caring patients tbh (thank god im nurse physician). see people deny what’s happening actively dying would much personally. maybe want kids get actual education.

I get schools need closed right now, don’t pretend won’t impact kids years. I'm sorry what???? Please explain wrong asking China regulate markers seems elevated risk? China want that? lol... whatever fam No, “new normal” whackos antisocials want continue making people social distance mask even they’ve vaccinated, want make everyone wait 5-10 year development period “regular vaccine” order “make sure it’s safe”.

These aren’t rational unselfish people. They’re self-interested antisocials want continue use stigma surrounding socializing pandemic era personal benefit. time, 15th November 12 600 people hospitalised COVID-19 Japan. UK ~13 500 yesterday population two times smaller.

So Japan 2x better per capita hospitalisation numbers UK even though Japan apparently almost 30x better UK number new daily cases per capita? Something weird.

Obviously know Japan hospitalises everyone covid not. CDC ashamed handled pandemic. REASON EXIST. “Due community spread” -I wondering every everyone wears mask facility home sanitized often. enough PPE? Holy shit... gave source info, I’ve told countless times ppl r/covid19, want get feel mean, absolute, overwhelming majority people die COVID quite old and/or poor health. I'm sure calculated somewhere, I'd imagine number quality years life lost along lines bad flu year, often hits young hard old. trust it.

See effects propaganda.

Anti government.
Anti science. 
Anti trust general. 

Stunning. response Sandy Hook taught exactly kind country are.  meant interesting horrific evil treating  No, isn’t. restrictions vaccine widely administered. people it, ease back restrictions. Especially level effectiveness we’re seeing newest vaccines, Fauci saying could working back towards normal spring. China values human rights suits them, blatantly violates otherwise.

Turns US kind meh issue instances think completely misunderstood referring That’s dogs. Thanks guys. I'm saving posts. argument? Great. That's 1 less person line front me. look that! kind pattern emerging. We’ll probably need years study sure /s. appreciate comment. already figured adults acting like, well, rational adults. gone consider work arounds this, basically meant talk idiots problem. given something think regard changing adapting communication styles reach irrational people. April honestly sounds great Good.

Sadly, wonder long last though. 9/11 2008 crash trimmed it, travelling still bounced back. We're 300k normal average yearly deaths iirc. yea, pretty conclusive we're talking old age deaths covid. Stay apart* Either understand climate science lying. it? Nonsense. 

Now made us state zero measures prevent spread COVID-19, he's working force kids back school. Lol yes I’m aware. buddy Marx wrote blog posts phenomenon. Florida full shit almost like there's difference lives lost terrorist attack lives lost disease, happens every year degree every decades severity seeing year. wants hear rich geriatric assholes argue get confused? aint nobody got time that, congress ain’t going help us cannonball run record isn’t gonna break Someone explain 'smart person' Federalism want unelected medical person charge anything. 

Then remind Dr many mistakes made, many times changed mind, bad advice general. reasoning locking potentially saving 100 lives per day? Well yeah, else would pay aside Taxpayer. gets sick, pay too. agree. agree deaths still matter disregarded? guys need coordinated federal level response across states Canada's pants. Lockdowns, masks, hand washing, restrictions movement, closing sports venues.... work lowering spread infections deaths. NBA it. larger scale, Singapore, Taiwan, big parts Australia, New Zealand it.

The economy move forward slowly Covid-19 death rate move backwards. Life change get new normal. anyone it, America can. Stay safe stay healthy neighbour north. Yes, getting soon allowed RKI one half thousand infections good hundred deaths less sort discrepancies happening regularly lately.  don’t know got much votes. agree you. half year pandemic, clear used political weapon, although strongly wish isn’t.

I guess original point is: it’s propaganda lot people buy it. also fact since April it’s claimed herd immunity would around corner Sweden

Never covid press briefings. That’s sad. Oh snap, everybody claiming 95% now. get 96%? Come Oxford! anti new normal people want go around partying Moderna raises 96%. ones bringing Manitoba? surprise here. business leaders recognized value remote work client engagement. pay travel avoid it! Obviously not. taking vaccine like robbing Peter, pay Paul. may long term effects. 
In summary, quick vaccinate. I'll wait year research take it.  random internet dude intuitive sense info experts field? Ok. UK, supermarket seems well stocked, even weekend national lock 2.0. loo rolls aisle still half stocked managed peek storage warehouse, sooooooooo many bags loos rolls. think supermarkets supply chain preparing, assume sales trend team good job.

During first round lockdown, impossible get online supermarket delivery slot. get one book slot week advance. Pretty much items want stocked.

Maybe smaller spaces Europe? tend stock little extra? Great rest us bonus loosing one idiot society!! 

I call complete win! 2020 year idiots self euthanised global population average iq hits record highs People always say trust scientists. scientists say something don’t agree with. Meanwhile 700,000 people DC zero representation Congress. USA mask wearing much much higher Canada, western world throughout pandemic. Look are.

I wear one pro-mask, think far biggest deal. would wear one 1 percent effective. sure effective really practice among general public Covid, AFAIK hasn’t randomized control study yet. similar experience friend passed away February. awful died young cancer, blessing got see died, freely. I’m noticing certain sect Brooklyn...

I use certain supplies damn would love find supplier particular product wasn’t (anti-mask business owners). 

I won’t even send anyone anymore. It’s either get materials delivered. *much* easier blame someone else and/or call fake actually admit there's something it. Another talking point likes bring Swedes moved around lot less summer i.e. followed recommendations better people neighboring countries.

The thing cases Finland Norway 10 per day 50 Denmark Sweden topped \~1000 daily cases June. wonder Nordics smaller decline mobility. quit job making 150k year burnout writing software home office.  Damn 10K past previous late spring early summer peak trending upwards… shit getting awfully close fan set high… also- low case/death rate spring made people calm ignorant. Uff Da Well missing point it’s bit annoying. whole thread response guy said America better majority Europe stupid lockdowns. He’s idiot. 
Anyways congrats ns. Good job there. I’m hk. less 25% less deaths per capita ns. good. 
Wish rest world better  utter shit makes think year since thing appeared, we're somehow magically able control nothing far shown can? Like get back normal, there's empirical evidence indicate danger usual. Paranoia fear evidence. Nobody seems know they're getting infected, means thing spreading freely time anyway. Lol maybe everyone reddit bitches learning cell biology high school wisen Dolly treasure ❤️    US, probably sometime April-July widely available hang inside right now. Cards, clubs, beers brats. Food friends crafts. It’s North Dakota way. year, add COVID roulette. must think doctors bootlickers huh? New Jersey assume, makes North Dakota look even worse relatively definitely counted way death 10 year old trying assess danger virus. HW HW HWFG!!! hope widely available general public time spring. Hopefully healthcare workers elderely vaccinated within next couple months. Lol hate that’s pretty hysterical.

I’m genuinely concerned I’ve somehow forgotten speak English. don’t understand. 

I made joke post “most” doesn’t mean much all, I’m somehow asshole saying virus isn’t bad? don’t get it. legitimately don’t get it. Yes, definitely, massive fall peak cases - Belgium. Many European nations managed stop drastically slow increase also.

I guess makes sense, governments better info testing/surveillance, policies work. time put Indian casinos money work, right? Right? countries comparable Sweden anything. I'm lucky enough work home. go events me, would largest risk. empathy people work go school house constantly exposed. see adding one exposure seems like acceptable idea them. literally different marginal risk. wish they'd stop lacrosse games stuff people would tempted.  you’re ok potentially getting virus could cause long term side effects? nothing else, least pandemic shown us leaders lead “leaders” hide, fall apart, become unhinged, etc.  Tokyo 40% positive test rate. 5.8 % positive test rate. distributed like though thinking perfectly even distribution. come clusters. live north jersey knew people died it. know badly. Besides know almost one who's it. like next election result!   I'm curious word brunch became catch-all fake woke libs care politics 80 World Trade Centers deaths far, trending almost one day. !remindme 4/18 really need repeat vaccination process every year this? Actually saw prices going good masks still available. KN95 bit crapshoot since many many Chinese brands (it's Chinese standard). try Amazon, ebay, try ones thousands reviews. 

For KF-94s (I'm wearing work) -- BOTN KF-94 great, comfortable, major Korean brand. Tests show real deal (~99% filtration). [Link tried I've seen good reviews tests showing real deal [link alive tired? outrage

I give day conspiracy theorists begin arguing vaccine designed make us tired push back government control. prove vaccinated?  Welcome tragedy commons Oh wow.

*Europe Asia entered chat (I think Africa too?)

These poor women, UTIs. access toilet paper 😢 title gulf **leaders** Britain United States. refuse put category Donald Trump. remaining question get dose?

I would guess pretty soon, things considered. Options probably vary based assume people walk past street dose?

I assume take long time. logistics anti-vaxxers people skeptical new fast-tracked vaccine, doubt happen anytime soon. Hopefully everyone wants vaccine get end next year less die-hard opponents convinced. least that’s honest saying; “Up 100% efficacy” meaning 0-100 mask reduce spread air mouth. Thats does. Nothing more, nothing less. Best do.. limit contact. make immortal... holy shit no. Eh, using materials long time. risks different flu shot. I'm curious going handle distribution going cost money.  Virus 99% survival rate. Hardly anybody gonna ""die off' It’s easy blame bars restaurants (and I’ve done share this) fact summer people acted foolishly establishments didn’t see cases surging like this.

It’s easy blame schools, too. seems like cases started surging start traditional cold flu season. don’t think there’s one easy thing pin blame risk body attacking cells making protein? risk cells keep pumping protein forever, thus constant cycle body attacking proteins? I'm interested learning mechanism eventually stops process.  know needs kept cold temp. happens point lab syringe warmed up? way tell? Why? standard reactions flu shots well. almost good sign body reacting producing immune reaction. Heroes Stay strong stay long brah! think assuming able use connections vaccinate everyone summer coming compete work olympics. make spectators show proof vaccination allowing come. Whether works like depend pull personally going wait months year comes hear early adopters

I keep hearing people say funny me. Maybe different country I'm pretty sure countries elderly, risk groups, health care workers essential workers vaccine available first. Unless belong one groups, gonna get vaccine upon release anyways, even really, really wanted mandatory, opt-out rather opt-in believe, hade go way want it. No, that's means. means 28 days injection, vaccine 95% efficacy rate. ""begins kicking in"" nearly impossible say strong certainty, reasonable guess would starts show efficacy days takes 28 days reach maximum levels protection. competition highest effectiveness number?   seems shady me. go around saying mandatory Sweden, guess me, never read anywhere be, bought enough entire population. May odds ever favor gullible goose though, so... Still isn’t better before? don’t someone pushing cart you’re trying pay? Maybe Texas antsy cart pushers check line. sounds like bad thing face, missing context two doses, spaced roughly three weeks apart. quote saying four weeks **first dose**. means effectiveness reached quickly second dose, I’d call good news. Never. common even less common transportation equipped it. Even arrives destination, refrigerated 5 days. I’ve seen it’s advanced purchase *agreement*

Not *advanced purchase*

Either way though, government didn’t fund R&amp;D Pfizer, original comment. Def job. didnt say question opinion business travel would reduce.  airport needs re-designed. crowding-at-the-gate needs addressed. Boarding needs happen doors. fat business people :D Econ 102, that's supply demand works. Things priced according individual consumer pay, people willing pay premium vacations safety restored, especially since Americans *saved* money crisis. establish new price point, price point necessary keep businesses afloat, see shift perceived value hotel stays vacation-related activities general, actually happen supply shrink many years hotel chains close less profitable operations rather trying keep afloat. Source? 30 days seems excessive.  logic goes fact 60% lying. bet real answer 80%. I'll probably minority choose raw dog first post-vaccine winter wear mask certain situations, especially cubicle farms make comeback. vaccine(s) distributed intended efficacious predicted see 2020-level precautions necessary public transportation, high-density indoor areas, etc. — yeah, I'll probably still mask fall 2021/winter 2022. Probably anytime soon these, 42 per cent participants diverse ethnic backgrounds

Doesn't mean represented given 50 percent us population white? quelled fears. know much vaccine creation process idea vaccine get made ready year seemed crazy worried. guess issue would see one 30k test patients happening. That's nurses complaining.  popular. like using unknown materials. already know long term. Im pretty sure one allowed wait. gonna mandatory enough supply. Well 5700 cases reported last wednesday, 4000 today. graph daily cases also seems trending downwards quire bit. guess won’t know certain next week. least rate daily case increase seems slowed significantly. gives erection  know, didn’t want sound stupid front actual scientists thought someone might know haha mean healthcare workers longer wear masks? Vermont single town 50,000 people, get congressional representation. I'm VT lived DC past 5 years, crazy one places congressional representation state overall less people, drive 8 hours away live somewhere people voice national government. getting depressed. Probably going deny ever said anything sort.   Yes world difference ""we know ever end"" ""we multiple vaccines, end coming"" That's pretty much vaccines immune system works. takes little bit. Full protection needs time immune system preparing whole time. trial set measure effectivity 28 days, since earlier protection tricky accurately determine. I'm suddenly reminded [last year's measles isn’t allowed sub

Only go groupthink  I’m surprised usa hasn’t steered taxes filling allowances government officials give nurses hazard pay Doesn’t vaccine prevent getting it? redditor mentioned made conclusion part experimental group without input experiment designer, can't assume experiment double-blinded someone made rationalization. goal empirical evidence. 
That said, lots vaccine trials double-blinded, example top head: back day, polio vaccine trials double-blind. Apologies watching video link to.

But point still stands....is Bill Gates going sell private jet fly commercial? making recommendation us commoners? Australia, according colleague lives there, there's travel states lockdown intense. mirroring lot New Zealand policies. I've heard 14 - 21 days immunity second dose. believe that's estimate point, best we've got far Nobody gives shit can't accept responsibility fact actions put family members risk

Would want accept responsibility family getting potentially deadly illness? Much comforting even taken so-called ""precautions"" everyone told to, worked anyway. Focusing pandemic strengthens climate change.

Climate change cut fraction human beings planet within next couple decades. population vaccinated Even negative externality could significantly negatively impact others? Sounds selfish really trusting ""your gut"" scientists? believe might make mandatory take here. 

I dont get people ok this.


This literally violating primary right bodily autonomy. way spin this. government willing pay $1200 per person, they'd mind-blowingly stupid throw another $40 per person. Nice. me. hope number keeps dropping get it, starts rising otherwise there's way healthy college student ass gonna get dose 😔 one biggest reasons get angry see people saying health care practitioners *allowed* choice stop working strike not.  
It's lives, able exercise choice continue, not, see fit. Number 2 going vary state, going High risk essential workers (Teachers, Food/Aggro pop. Scrub-licker! discussion guy told masks communism going round us give in!

It’s disturbing radical right re-educated Americans pure conspiracies. cheering Pfizer - truly weirdest timeline. Right. Canada suggesting two layer fabric third removable filter layer. gf designed like April. Much science common sense. people wear masks wrong wash them, wear wrong kind mask, mask benefit wearer. Somehow seems obvious. Hypothesis: large amounts beer prevents tetanus.  Let's get study going. Inauguration day almost February. Like 10 days. pedantic?  Username check out. gave us thermometer diagnostic stuff - like thing measure swelling injection site - told us use noticed anything. Plus curious, especially day second shot felt off. 
My temp normally runs around 97.5 F, 100 kind high me. considered fever doctors doctors trial pooh poohed it. Weird. We're#1👏👏👏👏👏👏😷🤔 already know least one family infected back June reinfected. Positive PCR tests times. First go around, ended hospital. No, both. clearly increased mask manufacturing dramatically since became easy get masks around April so. want cause run masks already available early make sure healthcare workers available.

Not best strategy, agree, silly discuss mention reason (stated widely time) people encouraged get masks early on. \*BioNtech vaccine   I'm honestly bothered much mask, helps I'll continue indefinitely, least shopping, public transportation like. Morons Oh ok. Yh 94 confirmed covid cases says minimum threshold 62 cases. total phase 3 trials 43,000 participants Hey, bad. stock market made full recovery!! really interesting helpful. I'm wondering there's way ELI5 move easily tfry convey others. never get flu shot see anyone bitching moaning could spread Grandma every year. upset told Pffft. That's 0.1%. /s Also we’re country didn’t care Bush Jr. covered Prince Bandar’s involvement funding 9/11.  Republicans love Saudis pay trump bribes. Yeah idk getting downvoted. point absolutely spot on. culture around working sick NEEDS change. Masks distancing work

washing hands sanitizing products nothing.

Instead washing / sanitizing, wear goggles about. much impactful washing / sanitizing. read, homie. question would afraid benign reaction. need phrase way specifically? conditions nothing anything except risk actual virus. non-face mask group, 2.1 percent participants infected new coronavirus, 1.8 percent participants face mask-wearing group difference big enough conclude certainty benefit using face masks regard protecting oneself infection.
The researchers stressed limits conclusions drawn study thereby fails confirm expected halving risk infection wearer face mask, results could suggest moderate level protection 15-20 percent,” Danish-language press statement notes.

This pretty much line understanding before. Masks mostly useful spreading virus others (not examined study) slightly effective helping get it. study enough data confident part.

This basically reinforces notion masks alone really effective suppressing virus useful everyone using them, absolutely used excuse ditch masks altogether. Yeah fuck old people, cares propagate spread old people die. Source? PATRIOT ALERT PATRIOT ALERT. #ISALUTEPATRIOTS supposed bum knee fixed last April. probably even going fixed next April. complaining. Better limping dead. Yet article says found moderate level protection around 15-20% wearer.

That's pretty substantial dealing virus R value little 1. Universal making could easily difference viral spread increasing decreasing.

And that's looking protection wearer. slightly better protecting others, 50% overall benefit. Please leave move socialist country! America luckily never socialist country, clearly never happy freedom capitalism. would better America moved different country fitted like Cuba, China, maybe Venezuela. many great options! great news. I'm saddened nearly [half interested taking vaccine. .... Who?! can't tell celebration protest... Never hurts prepared worst. Yes agree also what? random question far question answer relevant helpful anyone lacks time inclination read article full. 

 think reason got downloaded, alluded another commenter , question appears toeing party line were. Even seems show cases leveling off. Since cae count day reporting similar, compared drastic increases week prior. already approaching rollout think COVID going really expensive change way country operates travels? even year yet. That’s going happen. They’d whine healthcare workers aren’t jobs. worried. trials robust. worried known disaster COVID. oh yeah, patients lying staff daily pre-screenings, risk exposure super high. I’ll take thing day it’s available. 

-Healthcare worker thanks, makes feel better Long term side effects vaccines extremely rare. vaccines fail either fail early onset side effects lack efficacy. still chance 1 50,000 side effects pop risk covid real right people worth risk. 

This plus time rolled public one year data phase participants. made stop realize USA whole isn’t far behind. least United States, considerable dry ice manufacturing capability; pretty standardized well-integrated process point manufactured large quantities byproduct ethanol production. mean *easy*, compared quantities vaccine itself, less likely limiting factor, especially DPA invoked.

I know, example, dry ice orders increasing dramatically last weeks, even amidst that, institution still issues access dry ice healthcare research purposes.

That said, plausible shortages dry ice consumers/for non-healthcare purposes, especially government invokes Defense Production Act increase dry ice supply. It'll free US, whether insurance I’m excited nurse, little worried breastfeeding mom. work covid unit though, think it’s better safe. know long term effects? super excited time seems near leave subreddit archived. know counting chickens early. goddamn excited say goodbye y'all regulate insider trading, major stock sales announced approved well advance. article linked refers sales plan approved August, elaborates compensation came from, bothered reading it. “States case fatality rate 0.003%, 0.02%; 0.5% 5.4% age groups 0–19, 20–49, 50–69, 70 over, respectively.”

Its easier believe people stupid rather massive conspiracy vaccines. That's anti vaxxers get vaccinate, claim rights violated (nevermind rights people putting risk) Wow, fast! Amazing job! Bro telling me. I'm medic major metropolitan area getting hit covid calls whole pandemic. also two year-old eight month-old home. I'll vaccine soon available. meat prepared minimum safe temperature, likely would eliminate almost risk. Fruits veg often eaten raw, see would concern. living India couple years, grew accustomed washing fruits veggies fruit veg wash. I'm sure would kill though. know SARS-COV-2 lot resilient lot bacteria. US. specific date minor symptoms barely remember, tired like one day. wife went urgent care diagnosed ""Infection Upper Respiratory Viral - Primary"" time never tested COVID back then. Mine verified SARS-COV-2 IGG AB, SERUM test though. flu vaccine somewhat different vaccines it’s prediction strains flu common given season. Predictions aren’t perfect, vaccines aren’t given yearly. I’ve never excited get stabbed life

And -70°C needle boot. really hope big one. like big things me. That's decided. Placebo group get degree priority, unclear degree, continue participation trial. 

Could agree participate doses done drop out? Yes, plan to. testing low, compare sample tested results get percentage infected? could apply non tested people? Never sick since started wearing one, even sniffles. Fuck sick. stop wearing everyone reasonable chance get vaccine. zero sympathy regard anti vaxxers get fucked. wonder mask quality US. people still wearing homemade cloth masks. Quite poorly fitted. see many people wear masks around strangers. wear shops, offices. worded badly. point news back negative. Even we’d hear something good, would get debunked something bad. feels like breath fresh air know finish line coming soon. wear mask nose sometimes. No, please excuse absolute ignorance. thing assume everyone commenting Reddit American. incredibly obnoxious me, sorry. Ha, yeah, it'll great wearing mask icy wind chill days without anyone thinking weird. definitely starts getting beyond understanding, think risk proteins produced forever. vaccine cells volatile destroyed time passing instructions. Unlike CRISPR training new DNA made perpetuity. ""tricking"" RNA make something illicit immune response. Since manipulates RNA, remnants process recede immune system ""learned"" point. vaccine must stored low temperature (since volatile) well Pfizer Moderna vaccines require booster dose. Oxford vaccine single dose live higher temperatures. Finally, good fucking news example? done call virus hoax best make money medical supplies sold states would argue common sense needs inform science. example, becoming obvious airborne transmission besides droplets, hang air period time. Look dustmote floating sunbeam. much smaller aerosol virus? Go figure.

This woman coronavirus visited a Starbucks cafe north Seoul month, two dozen patrons tested positive days later. four face mask-wearing employees escaped AC unit mentioned article later found missing filter.

I think better science would least survey mask compliance, (over nose, wash regularly), compliant non-compliant cohort. compliant cohort showed less signs infection, throw masks out. study exists, stick common sense, keep mask on. ""US vaccines"" No, look faily cases graph see peonounced decrease daily reported cases since friday, meaning new cases dropped. wednesday compared last wednesday used counter friday-friday comparison. talking point they're using vaccine rushed can't trusted, therefore take it. going lot acceptance even among people consider anti-vax. Breaking news: vaccine announces 95.1% effective recommended 4 5 dentists part? they’ve won’t get ill again. Especially within time frame. 55 million cases handful reported reinfections.  So? least something's happening. I'm Florida, wife nurse. Back spring hospital set triage area parking lot tents expected surge. never materialized taken shortly after. friends NYC though know much worse there. person one ounce compassion fellow human beings, get point.

This disease exposed weak country really is. every man f*** willing ANYTHING protect friends, family nation contracting deadly disease.

I believe countries seen easy get Americans other's throats name FREEDUMB! insane government response covid 19 pandemic. people answering answers? isn’t like every vaccine world. RNA might differ. Well 5700 cases reported last wednesday, 4000 today. 

False.

The first number November 11 reported 12th 4,296. next report (13th) increased 5,764. Since changed couple times stands 5,712.

The history FHM's reporting number cases day initially wrong, often quite significantly, take week number stop changing. example, yesterday's report said number November 11 5,757 45 cases removed number today's report.

That's can't look last couple days' numbers say ""it's levelling off"". Good thing whole population going get infected Honest question: everyone's thoughts possible long term since effects? I'm planning getting whatever vaccine release becomes available general population (after risk folks gotten it) I've come across people take bc say way know might long term. answer curious hear thoughts others. No, Brazil. mask decided keep pocket coz want one mask. 

It's funny coz people said go back ones taking care rn. case numbers community plummet. goal vaccine control spread population, make one invincible individual. vaccine, still 1/20 shot effective. 95%, applied many many people remove statistically remove virus, making odds ever encounter someone approach zero, 95% immunity enough. know someone ""done"" virus back April I'm pretty much ""done"" her. pandemic certainly identified categories people belong in, ""done with"" category people back crisis, care live die, needs them. Come think it, I've urge use Windows Mac. said urge existed since '90's. I'm never gonna stop wearing mask. think look cool That's refused leave. died able move.  lifted finger? tool look positivity rates. kind crazy. Even states done well starting see line go up. 10% positivity nationally, yeah, pretty much uncontrolled spread. Aerosolized poop particles. I'd like see expressions realise they're gonna buy masks want participate society. don’t know I’ll get response anyone else asked, isn’t 95% success rate dependent additional precautions taking? Remote working, masks, social distancing, plexiglass, etc.? need continue wearing masks even everyone willing take vaccine taken it, example?  thought study changes spread group whole, importantly protects people, wearers. 

What need large study *that*. vaccine needed didn’t deserve That’s even option hospital removed chairs break rooms put occupancy limit signs tables. We're even allowed put candy bowl let alone host potluck. exactly. that's whole point placebo!

""Yeah doc fevers chills intense pain, headaches vomiting""

""Sir, saline injection."" remember Times, lots lots people would put words together would sound like this: calm, civil, rational, measured. Thank reminder happy golden days. stakes battle know downvoted lol. sad exciting thing late feels like best XMas present ever???? okay thanks. like, minute passes   Within first month sure, they've run headlines doubt though,-

""I got vaccinated still got Covid""
""Experts cast doubt safety/efficacy vaccine""
Even concerns complete nonsense. 

Fear sells sadly thing 99% recovery rate side issues friend longterm side issues problematic Funny percentage jumped match Moderna's. 

Nothing fishy this. 1/1000 = 0.001
0.001 x 100 = 0.1%

That’s like take 100 pennies, cut one 10 pieces, take one pieces, that’s many ppl died Covid. I.e. BAD STOP AFRAID FUCKS  I’m saying estimating, others said thread, “model” wildly inaccurate. go back look updates, said true - predicted 410k deaths January first September update, February, they’ve pushed back March. Well region would treat like pandemic instead completely disregarding it, maybe hospitals condition. Foreign disinformation campaigns. Subs like targeted.  in-laws Group 3. put well.

My MIL so, mad Covid deniers. told husband (Zoom call) thinks anyone wear mask forced sign agreement they'll die home go hospital. 

In March April, FIL vacationed time share invited financial advisor husband live another state property. know numerous parties since March, limit number guests ""distance.""

They also organized several protests worked polls. mean, I'm proud caring somebody it, stuff. they're old medical conditions. 

Recently MIL's Trumpy brother contracted Covid hospitalized. got lot eye rolling texts irresponsible was. was. So, irresponsible. really hold ""but matter time get stop parties.""

MIL extroverted isolating worst nightmare. feel like I've training pandemic life. get different sacrifice. lot in-laws Covid theater, wearing marks that's good people do, without really willing change behaviors others can't see easily. Nobody knows pool party, everybody store sees throwing tantrum wearing mask. know? /r/titlegore  Delete Except cosplayed Deadpool last International Women’s Day. Americans Germans save world bar soap better? (Actual question, trying contrary) 99% recovery rate fuck get info? Literally half patients covid describe lingering chronic pain trouble breathing even six months infection. mentions plethora side effects like infertility. state teen year old die yesterday. We've multiple people 20s 30s die it. people probably preexisting conditions well say ""oh fat/had pre-existing conditions"". Pfizer vaccine needs ultra cold storage right?  kids still going school places? kids able spread something? We’ve gradually stocking time go approach try every couple weeks get ivermectin? ""Government tell people handle business"" ""Muh Freedoms!"" 


""Government tell people handle business!"" 



What bunch hypocrites. *Veterans Affairs One would think would highest risk adenovirus antibodies, good know. Weird. shows stock delivery next Tuesday. Fuck. US watching envy. know theyll charge us ass it. someone explain test vaccine?


Like, get group people haven’t COVID expose virus? seeing % people immune?


I read thalidomide issues drug designers aren’t able easily test drugs wide scope people. Usually young fit males, women child bearing age old people.

If that’s case, test COVID vaccines ones vulnerable?



Looking forward coming though, curious get claim. Thank you...that's great info.

 Idk downvoted asking legitimate question. Reasonable questions actually useful, trolling. world IFR 10% unless population old folks home. likely confusing IFR CFR  IMO, vaccine right around corner worth it. 
 
 hanging make hanging future much better. American media basically propaganda since April.

The remdesivir announcement seemed part coordinated media push get things back normal.

Americans know crazy media makes them.  Thank service, i'd gladly let board plane haha must missed this, could possibly give link? Even states formerly control losing it. Md 6-8 Doctors always wore masks this.

(obvious /s)  COVID-19: \*shoots SA\*

Federal government &amp; idiots Reddit: ""Why would Dandrews this?"" Yes customers exposure limited maybe hour week, floor employee exposed people hours day multi days week. even important wear masks safe get detected right away could spread multiple people. Hell yeah It’s possible. don’t know enough yet. wife wear remember. works hospital hospital policy employees must wear mask face shield work. think gotta protective mask. Yes exactly. point is, coverage massively exaggerate minor side effects highlight extremely niche cases know available healthcare workers US? cherrypicking. 

Many European countries handling virus well, implemented lockdowns necessary. EU set funds get every country kickstart restart economies push recession, countries also given many grants citizens businesses keep working. far many, *many* countries done.

The countries handled virus best East Asia, Taiwan, South Korea Japan. full empathy. career got fucked too. Airlines going room bring back 150k yeeted. small potion might get picked next two years, mostly furloughs. next 3 5, many us, game over. can't afford wait around can't shit again. want 10 years older trying start over, I'm now. ~~good~~ utterly fine time lasted. 

Good luck dude. taking told means end lockdowns back summer. open? go ton still, noticing massive drop mask compliance weeks. last week seems picked back least every time went store see maskers. Dry ice HAZMAT regulations much aircraft carry, carried. fine transporting item needs kept deep freeze, large quantities different story. 

Also, dry ice containers need vented.. sure reduces effectiveness it. sounds petty Pfizer like 

“Oh Moderna vaccine 94% effective? Well 95% that” data shows 2.2% death rate: really point though. example, herpes simple virus 100% non-death rate sticks around life causes sorts side effects.

There many reports side effects damage people “recover”. So, take chances want, you’ll likely recover may may side effects. level risk willing take you. Edinburgh’s Riley said suggests now, pursuing idea herd immunity COVID-19 vaccination better approach, said, could “turn herd immunity head”, use first limited supplies vaccines protect need, without worrying robust members “herd” live relatively happily forget protecting masses protect vulnerable,” said. “Let’s directly protect vulnerable.” Buy n95s, wear goggles practice good hand hygiene ok. really need 7 n95s rotate daily last good while. Since dealing aerosol generating procedures active covid patients make n95 last long time. Protect careless, selfish idiots.  Let’s say aliens landed town started hunting humans sport. average killed 100 people day town 100,000 people. 10 days town meeting stand say “why worrying?! 99% survival rate!!”

That’s sound.  There’s showing people live Manhattan dakotas combined Zombies September 9. Fuck coincidence first two peaks similar. third peak already see period amplitude changed, sine. precaution literally personal cost? not? mean they've gone 17 cases 2 cases 48 hours

Not saying it'll definitely 6 days, they're hitting early, great hopefully lead best-case scenario (or... least-worst-case scenario least) think coronavirus higher threat time being.... vaccination basically mRNA fine go traditional way injecting vaccines? use mRNA virus Starting within month places, take roll might bit misleading feeling fast deaths rising lag reporting. Since week 31 (last week July) week 42 (mid-October) total weekly deaths around less 20. Since close doubling every week - 43 = 46, 44 = 77, 45 = 141 (and complete yet), 46= 129 (and incomplete too). quite sharp opinion. Except electoral votes worth jack shit actual candidates everyone knows way they're going vote regardless politics policy.

No choice means agency. outbreak hospital overload seeing Halloween. That’s even big fall holiday. Family friends threw giant rager Halloween, wife ICU THIRD hospital needs critical care hospitals she’s space equipment. That’s four days, keep transferring her. She’s completely different state. husband hospitalized yesterday put vent. two kids home likely going orphans next week. heard yesterday three people one party hospital one vent. 

Our hospitals full. ICUs packed. People social media planning full Thanksgiving celebrations talking travel plans Christmas. It’s like watching 1,000 car pileup slow motion, instead stopping traffic, people try monster truck jam.  limit study pass safety checks kinda jump conclusions That’s I’m saying. worst model there. contact Mayo let know doubts. I’m sure they’d welcome expertise matter know got it? Wasn’t double blind study? chose wedding 80+ people pandemic that’s spiking particularly hard OH. She’s moron, along everyone attended. mind noise means bothers me. ☹️ love husband much also would like die. there. health care worker another country, say also work. yesterday physician unit got tested positive. He’s quarantine now. Yet crew around continues work. to. asked want get tested want quarantine home. feel sad patients coming daily, trusting us healthy, reality, idea positive not. It’s America, it’s Europe well Countries apparently trapped bad worse pandemic spiral.

Belgium, Peru, Spain, Chile, Brazil, Argentina, UK, Italy.

With Mexico, Bolivia France tick behind USA spiral. 

Can list responsible parties countries tremendous failures well?

More countries (and tremendous failures) added list coming months. 55+?  Stay safe. FWIW, virus total roller coaster family members: We'd feel absolutely fine, BAM! usually around 3-4pm symptoms would kick high gear. Wake next day feeling great! Until....BAM! Nope, false alarm. weird. Half time sat around going ""*this* COVID? really?"" cuz felt normal. lows kicked hard even sit upright. Really go overboard,so much justified ""taking care client"". Mississippi went got succinct it.. 

&amp;#x200B;

**After Big Thanksgiving Dinners, Plan Small Christmas Funerals, Health Experts pointed first article, 7 deaths reversed. 2nd, first noted article even states peer reviewed. may perfectly fine accurate, worth noting. Beyond that, read it, looks like they're seeing 29% cases COVID initial primary cause initiated death, anything rule possibility COVID could still contributing factor. Regardless, want thank actually procuring amount data articles. Population control, making people becoming dependent government, killing old/sick people save money social services/medical care, getting Trump office, start new world order.

Obviously none make sense, common ones I've seen floating around Facebook. doubt don’t topic. never seen someone post 6 different articles Reddit rapid fire, right row before. Maybe state level? uniquely American problem. Strange comment Sucks developing country. requires-70C temperature times storage transportation. Ain't feasible smh Huge thank wife hard work guys. know hard work especially since mother also healthcare worker. know us complete idiots taking zero precautions.  I'm believe reddit, north south agree common capital. Really? love Webex. Though use server connects audio-only meetings. hardly features, necessary ones. know, alternative would football match open anyone. least letting vaccinated people people get experience it.

Sometimes fair gets way best outcome everyone. obviously better people get watch football match none easy internally move default think rule everyone would get see match. reality opposite. People completely arms prove they've vaccinated attend concerts events. Thing is, prove vaccinations go school, college/university, travel certain places, etc. Personal insults face loss. Typical :) Yeah didn’t say anything said haha Combined recent news I’m like doctor told that? Everyone else know got told 90 days. Nice b8 m8 Bill Gates vaccine? no. 

&amp;#x200B;

WITHOUT ever TESTING positive.

TESTING detects all. symptoms matter.

&amp;#x200B;

it's unheard of.

***SARS-CoV-2-specific cell immunity*** cases COVID-19 SARS, ***uninfected*** stores. Walmart mentioned operating 20% capacity, 5 customers per 1,000 sq ft. average Walmart store 180k sq ft. 900 people average size walmart. never walmart 900 people it. Maybe 600 tops peak city proper huge walmart. local walmart 100-300 customers 95% time open. Correct. Moderna needs regular fridge temps though. hospitals ultracold fridge Lab. get creative need to. Whoa received better information changed guidance. That's works. shocked something ludicrous like $5,000 shot. Hope stays $39 less globally would assume so, got placebo would told get actual vaccine right? Absolutely! I’m sick tell family friends thing every week. Like may bored, dad, doesn’t matter, we’re going Waffle House. Halloween party us, thanks. Nah, gonna skip cookout. Yes we’re still distancing. Yes, still. No, we’re “okay” it’s six families think fit “bubble” even though go bubbles. Nothing gotten better. Ha, right :) know friendless, poor loser, talk history. fact A. would done protect human life ( compelling state interest) B. added fact children would still access education online (narrowly tailored) means would likely upheld constitutional challenge. Source: law student. Lol one thoughts turning movie 28 days later lol I’m wealthy person I’d personally pay entire block meant getting everyone vaccine. I’ll probably stop 2023. :/ Bullshit Oh know. it’s paper. leaving anything chance point.

Edit: condolences dad. Sorry loss. me, disturbing fact relatively high mortality rate state low population density. NY/NJ higher mortality rate expected due high population density. ND 47th population density US. Wow 3,000 people died, first attack ever happen American soil citizens military. way complicated people dying. don’t enough everyone. 


usually county doesn’t act wise limited supplies time tell.  Idk, hope there’s big side effects. Always worries rush stuff like there’s sufficient testing. hope right solution covid. wife heroes. Thank 14th amendment friend. Unfortunately based cases probably still 1 double left. high worst weeks spring (if handy)? Dumb question please dont hate :
Can one tell legit pros cons vaccines I've heard mixed especially company.. Thanks! Yep. Meanwhile, I'm zoom Thanksgiving son: I'm getting everything cooked Tuesday Wednesday porch drop. We'll get zoom call Thursday eat watch Christmas Vacation together. 

He lives 10 minutes away, he's able work home, want risk (dinner person) given county well.

Mind you, husband died end February, I've isolated 24/7 since March 12. REALLY want fucking hear hard see family. can't even remember last time hugged another human being. 

I particularly want live insanity started. Now? hate pretty much everyone, humanity sucks. Lol determined stupid accept actual explanation. feel good knowing that? pre existing conditions years ago, list regulars ( fat, diabetic, cholesterol bloold pressure smoking ... )plus age. doctor got control longer qualified early vaccines. irony. Obviously crystals even work. Pyramids way go, combined CBD enemas.  bad choice all- make sure talk loved ones wishes maybe get living drawn up. 

Had put dad hospice last year KNEW wanted given circumstances in, comforting able open folder look piece paper signed said following wishes every time felt unsure scared wrong thing... Living Wills great. Yeah still dangerous Liberate Adelaide!

(says one... we’re ignorant selfish) great news, going work logistically? understanding Pfizer vaccine needs stored -70C/-94F. radio Minnesota big shot Mayo stating currently capability store vaccine temperature. 

If supposed one top medical facilities world Mayo clinic can't store vaccine today, going distribute administer huge scale need? Thank well. M$ bought Skype kill it. Skype wasn’t perfect improvements instantly ceased M$. fair, one took seriously got bad community. saw happened Wuhan, Italy take seriously first. saw happened Italy, NY take seriously first. rest country saw happened NY Washington, still take seriously first.

At least places like NY eventually came around taking seriously, part. wife truly awesome people. Thank you.  Even you’re right metric best, best way handle things, influence human behavior far food. don’t survival it’s do. long grandma taught kitchen 30 years ago. Look Dunbar's number. studied people average 500 acquaintances. still don’t know anyone tested positive.  gonna whole new government though. Pretty sure Biden said it'll free isolate home phase, shortage masks supply. Healthcare workers needed most. miss travelling, feel effective job now. I've realized suck connecting customers virtual meetings.   Everyone says terrorists atrocities listed, real winner US government. *wanted* endless wars, unchecked surveillance, etc. think 9/11 inside job anything like perfect cover things. That's coronavirus response disjointed comparison. never safety. actual data released yet, press release. We'll know answers soon. truly understand need large Thanksgiving. don’t. People don’t understand risks taking traveling medical system fragile. Cooking also sends people
To ER accidental lacerations. It’s like used could get real quick go home. Triage real you’ll back line.

Nice username probably wont get one. lot vascular issues kawasakis virus kid, chronic pancreatitis 30, probably wont give someone like me, older risk people likely get us younger risk populations. distribute beyond me, especially rural areas.   know popular hate Trump board, already said would free part Operation Warp Speed, unless Biden changes (super unlikely) be. support Federal Government- people needed forced work - Normalization occurs - Deaths rise - States look contain - Support Federal Government - people needed forced work - Normalization occurs - Deaths still rising - States look contain - get idea trial means get vaccine 5 months early. sound like worth it? said woo hoo group would get butthurt refused go family get together kid's birthday party. I'm Canadian, no. doesn’t though. argument isn’t even relevant. ""Forcing pilots locked front cabin literally like caging animals"" , ""My kids need see pilots plane flying every learn planes work"" , ""being forced take shoes off, liquids, take coat exactly Nazis Jews, America Nazi socialism Netherlands, rights"" hope front line workers get vaccine first cause deserve Obesity kills 300,000 people per year. respond? Celebrate illness give big “YAS 👸!”

I would expect nothing less. That’s said developed world cold chain sometimes expensive otherwise solved problem. It’s nothing worry about. We'll effective less debilitating vaccines future even case. knows, maybe vaccine could bi-yearly injection instead yearly. Remember government told safer wear mask March lmao  mean, seems like relatively reasonable article talks herd immunity way accessible laymen points directly protecting vulnerable much better starting strategy going herd immunity, start.

If anyone's expecting vaccines eradicate covid anytime soon, think they'll disappointed, that's mean, certainly hope nobody implies that's probable. one soft core individuals continue wear mask social distance. Like commenter said below. valid reasons it. 

Continue wear mask social distance ok.  Probably more. think 40% country said they’d take vaccine last time looked That’s death rate .001 percent
999 1000 survive. mom's friend's cousin's brother's aunt's friend also healthcare worker they're incredibly excited too. Please thank well. feel sucks, apparently different strains mutations happen tough do. False, done nothing help anyone, himself. Ain't happening, bud. Crazy think vaccine Germany funded anything Trump. forget get stabbed twice! nurse insomnia, gotten worse. Almost coworkers prescription type sleep aid smoke and/or drink able sleep.  I'm concerned them, concerned people can't get vaccine medical reasons kids anti vaxxers choice intentionally infect Covid. would wildly unethical do. live area high transmission rate, chances (back August started) high contract wild. Unfortunately, everywhere US chances high now. complications, given card give doctor show trial ever go see one reason. would special treatment me. 
As get, get bucks every time went knowledge moving science forward loved ones fellow humans. Sign fuck up. I’ll delete comment quick googling find saying 3 months 50% covid positive patients lingering symptoms commonly general fatigue. can’t find anything says 6 months. 

3 months still long time don’t get wrong I’m finding anything saying half positive cases symptoms 6 months lot people don’t listen them. Ohio mask date months went Home Depot right now, would say 1/3 aren’t wearing masks another 1/3 wearing masks nose. local school district posted picture one older teenagers mask covering nose sitting right next another person. Crickets. AMA go again. Stay home people overwhelm hospitals, please. Genuine question, vaccine history name causes serious side effects months even years vaccination?

I could spewing fake news, believe lot Gulf War vets health problems various shots gotten.

Also say investing, ""Past performance guarantee future results""

not saying get vaccine, Im personally going wait months year comes hear early adopters overblown media. US similar vaccination rates Western countries. Gas mask shows  Yea get it, weird design choice esp company primarily services US. Like OK Fran's Knitting Warehouse Boise, make scroll bottom list entering US shipping address.... Maybe it’s answered clearly article? dunno.  False, done everything power get soon possible. Trump vaccine distributed even last thing country. [Not sitting office cubicle farm classroom hours day wearing either cloth mask surgical mask, protected infection. *may* reduce inoculum receive infection, may influence whether get mild severe case, types masks intended protect prolonged periods time indoors. 

Schools virtual, job done remotely, *should* be. There's excuse pushing paper office setting 2020. age kids/babies it? immuno-compromised? incredibly rare situations people catching twice, immuno-compromised. already caught also probably don’t need vaccine since vaccines literally infecting disease build body’s immunity. least drive teenagers flee country. story Republican policies   One person vaccine group got severe COVID.  Flu... GBS. Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* That's fact. Canada already thanksgiving two weeks later huge spike trying stop covid unlike here.

Hospitals filling already. Two weeks thanksgiving hospitals hallways filled spilling parking lots. better getting ready bet ain't. theory, could develop safe recoded virus still infectious, produced appropriate immune response actual morbidity side effects, could actually vaccine greater 100% effectiveness (for every person inoculated, ended passed protecting 3-4 people whatever). I'm pretty sure would give ethics board coronary, though. accused ""picking quarrels stirring trouble""

If trying write script children's TV cartoon dictator would toss wording sounds ridiculous.

How real law? Pros: 
- die
- less likely infect people, hence die

Cons:
- people like might die

If vaccine safe, released. course, like medicine, vaccines side effects, rarely even severe ones. risks outweighed benefits several orders magnitude, vaccine authorized, regardless company. You’re moron Thank u thanking almost Feb? I'm perplexed would use instead inauguration day January.  mean, would know got vaccinated? suddenly going carry around papers saying we’re good like drivers license? cannot require anyone get vaccine comes EUA. watch Colbert unless accident. Thanks pointing out, didn’t notice that, front page morning. first paragraph ants gripping. Would glasses work protect eyes instead face shield? (Worn mask) seems realistic people stupid cut masks wear chin. Tfw horror movies seem realistic real life. Maybe turns coronavirus brown, might trouble them. government case federal government focus conversation. state government. wild Walter White shows 99% blue vaccine hope people prepare cook food continue wear mask too. 94 people tested? Yikes Great, thank you!! even that, isn’t fact. loving claims, body, where, knows thing than—distancing masks helpful stopping spread. fact worked plague ( distance isolation), got. looked like backing me. Yikes Ah 6% people around vaccinated person also get covid. What's sample size? Thank service It’s covered cares act afaik.  Good bot weren’t sure mean “disregard”, could asked. mean “to give *no weight all*”, poster seemed suggesting statement quoted took issue with. fair enough say saving lives people already low additional life expectancy *lower* priority, still desirable aim.

Now clarified meant “disregard”, able answer question yes no? past time either learn one many work-arounds shared Reddit every day, accept news costs money produce maybe subscribe. oh no! mean I'll never get go something never felt desire entire life?  also important note yet know people study completely protected vaccine made cases mild really notice. unlikely possible vaccinated people could still spread disease without getting infected. unlikely, possible. I'd say keep wearing masks know sure, might take while. US, Supreme Court upheld mandatory inoculation. good public freakout material next August school starts COVID vaccines required. Thankfully insurance sent statement anything relating coronavirus 100% covered. that's point. never symptomatic enough even bother tested. 

i've tested three times now, twice result potential exposure because, kid i'd never want put unless to. 

especially early pandemic brain tickling test, parent would kid tested adults family could test instead? baffles countries like Spain Italy deaths US, people still try put positive spin it. countries got slaughtered virus, unfortunately, looks like getting better moment. replying part said ""If tell placebo group."" Yes this, still get jumbo rolls won’t fit typical residential holder Clorox wipes still stock site: 5 cases. 6 days. 1 city. Get grip mate I’m trial. day injection pretty sore deltoid around injection site. also recall feeling kinda tired / shitty, although days also didn’t eat much supper felt better eating 🤷🏻‍♂️ 

Not sure got vaccine placebo though. never get intense reactions vaccines it’s hard tell.

I talked pharmacist got flu shot said something putting extra stuff vaccine generate stronger immune response results soreness. knows got from, took grain salt, but... can't always trust US government they've never done anything indicate trust them

There, accidentally misplaced *'t* realize he's lame duck never came lies put forth. office January 20th ensures wont see 100 million, $40 vaccines February. doesn’t mean federal government nothing, power order people do. power issue mask mandates.

This lie. 

You get tossed jail walk around pantless. government absolutely ability mandate fabric covering body, includes masks.

Your ""interpretation"" law willfully ignorant beyond dangerous. Hey btw moms friends cousin also healthcare worker. Heard shes pretty excited well  fucking hyped get jabbed needle. No, not. means enough workers sick. desperation move. also guarantee even forcing sick workers work enough.

It bad sign. dafaq...they’re best hospital US that's point. never symptomatic enough even bother tested. 

i've tested three times now, twice result potential exposure because, kid i'd never want put unless to. 

especially early pandemic brain tickling test, parent would kid tested adults family could test instead?  One rando study sudden everything’s question? Participants reported test results; mask use independently verified, users may worn correctly.  
Buy hey, whatever gets name paper! Yes Biden overlord know, must stand together fight deadly virus crippling nation Biden federal government hope get back normal! opposite also true; every COVID-19 death correctly attributed COVID-19 either. unknown number people likely dying without adding number, example person dies home might get test/diagnosis postmortem, etc.

Since excess deaths level bit COVID-19 deaths, seems likely death count numbers result pandemic undercount, overcount. fair, might explained indirect stress medical system COVID-19 COVID-19 directly, still, talking people would alive pandemic control. said healthcare worker too... operative word “most”. think u/CrypticCryptid ’s point people vaccinate early immediately throw caution wind, take longer us get point virus becomes “rather rare”. vaccine requires -70°C,right? I'm concerned COVID. still hate USA. know meant. Bruh Americans another level No, vaccine needs administered twice, 350 million. Thank mom’s friend’s cousin work. South Australia imposed strictest lockdown world seen outside Wuhan. Tell virus eliminated everything back normal Australia."
