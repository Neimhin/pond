0,2020-11-16," Chicken pox aren‚Äôt bad either. Hear shingles kinda sucks though. Anecdotal, Calgary, Canada, see waaay middle-aged/elderly people wearing mask, wearing wrongly, younger people. agent chaos? looks like shitty fall guy shitty film nineties. Official guidance could make huge difference people know right thing do, pressured family. way blame CDC say they're coming. give shit.

I downvoted Reddit replying comment series people talking reason want get virus want long-term effects it, seriously comtemplating saying ""fuck it"" tired quarantining.

I told sickening give shit it'd people they'd pass to. Hundreds millions close approval? really doubt city authority. governor maybe. cases growing control surprising.   Grow back bone shut covid factories (casinos). drove back Joshua Tree gaggle ""STOP STEAL"" protestors. (Joshua Tree National Park rural part state near several military bases.) CA like US miniature.

Anyone average intelligence grade 6 education knows one present time, leader follower, self respect. one world stop making right choice respects life well others. mean, they're wrong. Much comfortable. one I've used past drywall work wear time. look like total asshole, care. main problem hard talk on. I‚Äôm genuinely frightened Gretchen Whitmer‚Äôs safety point. planned kidnapping, theres telling happen. :/  stock markets crave. Don‚Äôt let Xi hook. CCCP lied suppressed info outbreak Wuhan months got truly control broke larger China internationally.

Then broke China, CCCP banned people Wuhan traveling within China, let travel internationally. massive middle finger rest world, letting virus like protecting own.

And still idea many Chinese died virus reporting cases deaths obviously huge lie. Utopia bet pretend care mental health issues tell people‚Äôs ‚Äúshutup stay inside!!!‚Äù Lol statistically far risk serious complications getting COVID even you‚Äôre young getting vaccine. It‚Äôs given 30,000 participants without deaths caused it.

Take pool 30,000 people give COVID even mortality rate 0.01% (as younger groups) you‚Äôd still three deaths Americans: Hold Mask, we‚Äôre going prove wrong. 
Cases increasing rapidly even vaccine we'll 1500 deaths day months. buses arlington, city next Dallas 400,000 pop. DEATH CULT DEATH CULT Little kids can‚Äôt get vaccine yet understanding. though agree adults responsible actions... usual future generations susceptible going pay adults mistakes. spent three months house mid March mid June. three forgettable months. remember months months since much fondly. He's Trump puppet following orders.. I'm Michigan read said like wanted hopeless anti masks wearers bare arms.. unprofessional russian paid troll would say. I'm sorry, know ""experts"" heck predict four months call accurate? 

No wonder Osterholm going around telling everyone use IHME use CDC model instead.  Fear kept us alive since written history, give now? live court Zoom months Dry ice ~ -80C freezing like impossible. 

It's lot difficult expensive ship Moderna vaccine. special equipment training needed. think medical government workers starting realize sociology psychology also extremely complicated.

&amp;#x200B;

1. 40% believe real threat
2. bunch people choosing weigh mental health physical health  people booing you, right! gonna even weirder grandma gets intubated field hospital.

Americans crazy. Planet needs break newborn people tbh DOL piece shit often pulls stats ass. Every nurse know looking exit. I'll take side effects get shit. Can't take anymore. county number 1 win prize?!? agree. Get bundled drink hot chocolate outside. Use zoom. don‚Äôt get it. It‚Äôs one year holidays. It‚Äôs like 3 days. People selfish. It‚Äôs children carriers old people looking long enough time line.  like response LOTTERY  It‚Äôs likely that. testing picked up. don‚Äôt know age cut though. I‚Äôm pretty disappointed low numbers people saying get vaccine. sure 2 little ones(4,6) won‚Äôt approved vaccine least another 12 months, still essentially lock due people getting vaccine. great click bait story!!  Except age group country extremely low risk. tell small clinical trials ALWAYS scale without problems. first vaccine kind mass produced timescale size scale never done too. I'll pass year two. 

Covid death sentence. Stastically youre 50, cold. Whatever gave silly idea mutually exclusive can't get both? get vote philanthropy. want pretend is, that's fine me, certainly philanthropy. would I'm apartment. I'm putting type hardware unless place. I'd also opt heated version Scott Atlas neuroradiologist. infectious disease doctor. It‚Äôs like asking dental advice cardiologist. Medical specialties interchangeable. He‚Äôs post he‚Äôs he‚Äôs ‚Äòyes‚Äô man nothing more. adds value COVID conversation. Thanks coming TEd talk . selfless self centered? important me, people weird family guidance works well framed safer options instead always perfect ones Damn that‚Äôs bad Same. 

We've blessed work home default husband's employer prefers err side caution (the building rent closed least January). 

We, nation, need take financial hit help businesses need close, close them. hard lock down. Pay ppl need stay home. careful, gradual opening. Long term, I'm sure better literally everything. Economy, virus control, burnt medical personnel, everything. 

I expert things tho. So, yeah. already upboats regression analysis guy lol grand total 81 children age 15 died covid-19 since start pandemic U.S.

That's actually less number children typically die flu year, making disease milder flu children. adults need worry about, that's death rate much higher.

For comparison, number Americans age 85 older died covid-19 69,252. Likely blood type Oh Gosh, give break.....  rise up, meant ""vote"" lol 3 weeks election. Yes that‚Äôs true, last week seeing 100k per day new cases week next week see massive increase hospitalization? eligibility requirements extremely detailed ensure subjects healthy. BMI, blood pressure, heart medications, etc. heavily biased toward healthy people purpose likely excludes large segment elderly.

 benefit danger recieving one dose/type vaccine? work similarily? hospitals stick rather hospital employees stick themselves. working exhaustion people care anything! stop accepting patients work ones already admitted. Let Facebook Qnon whoever believe savior save them. say like there's nothing inside home. think need relax bit, enjoy trip wherever going. sterility healthy all. Especially baby. right trying kill Americans? hospitals fill footage released chaos hospitals, think Americans wise up..

I ashamed say friends still compare disease flu assessing basic math. pre Covid times, I'm intending optimize profile taking way better pictures making interesting bio. Invest time stuff, help. hear photofeeler good resource pictures part. well forget 1-3 week lag hospitalizations, given tripled last 2 weeks cases per day see rise soon. Originally thought rounding corner back square one lot cases.

At point spiral analogy ‚Äúrounding corner‚Äù apt. way, procedure described would technically cleaner would never get approved ethical reasons.

Use deception science strictly regulated permitted special cases less minimal harm possible. 

For college psychological study requires person next co-conspirator secretly plays role, deception may approved case made.

For vaccine trial, way. fancy dinner French Laundry though? Asking friend That's exactly we're viewing it. Reddit seem like ""risk mitigation"", family members ones see regular basis. them.

So either see Thanksgiving seven us get COVID, see Thanksgiving still probably give COVID. It‚Äôs actually really debatable. whole point clinical trial determine efficacy therapeutic versus risk serious negative side effects.

If compare risk serious incidence getting vaccine versus risk serious complications COVID19 vaccine far safer several orders magnitude almost completely protects virus. ü¶† Trump's huge fan Polis Colorado, gay married. let‚Äôs protect ones need protecting healthy children adults out? know voted I‚Äôm serious.  keep hundreds millions people home?  ?

I think we've always page. always clear Pfizer's vaccine would require much logistics cost thus driving overall cost. point would important reason Pfizer set lower price Moderna bit competitively viable.

There's ""I read"". Maybe read talking about? sounds like violation Hippocratic oath 1 every 350 Americans tested positive last week ü§∑ Crazy said thing stupid comment someone downvoted upvoted lololol Soylent grow garden food, electricity overrated months running water still work. pull fucker's medical license. Regarding cases, others stated, monday tempers joy, looking mondays recent history certainly suggests positive change. Many countries dips numbers saturday monday due declining weekend lab volumes health units reporting certain days week.

Humanity doomed, individual human beings still inspire hope.  California beautiful rolling hills, forests, mountains - yes, even interior. west coast Vancouver San Diego God's gift man. I'm curious regulate mandates workplaces etc refuse vaccine. employers authority ask employees vaccinated? worked hospital couple years ago required employees get flu vaccine every year. wear mask working. Wonder something like implemented widespread work places/in public refuse?

Pennsylvania Health Secretary Dr. Rachel Levine today announce ‚Äútargeted efforts‚Äù containing coronavirus.

A news release 1 p.m. announcement specify efforts be. 
On Monday, however, Levine said state plans shutdowns dramatic measures instituted first wave pandemic spring.

Other states reverting earlier restrictions tweaking existing ones fall surge cases breaks daily infection records. Gov. Phil Murphy New Jersey, example, ordered limits private indoor gatherings reduced 25 10 people, limits outdoor gatherings reduced 500 150 people.
And Philadelphia officials Monday announced ban indoor dining restaurants indoor gatherings size, public private, city battles resurgence coronavirus, Associated Press reported.
 
The city also plans shutter gyms, museums libraries, prohibit in-person instruction colleges high schools, reduce occupancy stores religious institutions, city Health Commissioner Dr. Thomas Farley said news conference Monday.

Even Fox admitted deal news, entertainment. According numbers they've putting out, least. Actually, checking excess deaths state, Florida counting 2/3s pneumonia deaths resulting covid, average compare data states. scare weeks ago might meant needed admitted. terrifying thought! record federal government can't ban anything locally. mean local governments don't

Citation needed cancer treatment BANNED law/executive order doctor's government can't pick winners.

Um, hell not? get giving tax breaks buddies, that's obviously corruption. certain businesses/organizations risk necessary. agree liquor stores probably closed (if sell liquor) food places need open... churches not.  learned much since then....and done much since then. wow.0 don‚Äôt go Walmart that‚Äôs civil liberty!!  read too. superintendent sent email said they‚Äôre working county allowed continue planned opening. wasn‚Äôt explained. Well yea, since march, mid november, honestly, young healthy, probably like bad flu you, reason I'm following restrictions harmful older people, wasnt harmful older people, wouldnt wear mask. Disinformation seems like quite existential threat society.

It climate change alone. years look forward movies titled ""A Christmas Funeral!"" Uh... come numbers US still low? real problem people psychopaths, heart attack stroke next six months. avoid virus, can't avoid that. power brainwashing impressive.

If used good instead almost always bad. reason lockdown - case go hospital, ill get open bed, needed. Smoked turkey instead roasted! Stop fucking crying much. Tell reinfection rate is. Go ahead shithead. really think people scared getting reinfected moron. There's handful reinfections.

You're moron thinks handful reinfections statistically significant called scientific method Agreed. That‚Äôs nuts. People want break tradition somehow overrides *fucking pandemic.* Right. Funny didn‚Äôt know expert. Wanna know best part!? I‚Äôm actual ER nurse guess maybe see things anyone that‚Äôs trying tell reality situation!  interesting vaccine availability still wear masks practice social distancing. looks like wont end til maybe 2022 line doubters ""Do know anyone covid? hear stories know anyone personally it.""

Now, think everyone knows someone. get emails every day new cases high school daughter going shut down. wife works day care, cases there. cousin got it. fucking everywhere. People wanted pretend exist ass, well ass. now? 

""Oh, it'll suddenly go away election."" Well..... woods could still someone's property may around. Covid raises strange issues. One might look empty commercial land seem cameras. lot easier toward dusk dark. Holy shit drugs on? bleach well? Oh leave outside belong beliefs. way get rid you. knowing life isn‚Äôt ever going get better? Hospitals profit. insurance companies make profit squeeze hospitals.  ‚ÄúFeels good breathe.‚Äù worries, thanks answer anyway. comes point one assume know doing.. What? Distance who, eachother? might keep viral loads doctor. leave dwelling though, pick groceries curbside delivered China's entery system still super strict, get shipped directly airport quarantine hotel, cameras door make sure escape. 14 days regions, 21 days others, harsher regions even require family members quarantine seperate hotel suites infect quarantine extend infectious window. Swedes worship government. government goes hands-off, people too. Money saved, lives endangered cares lol, work needed No, made accommodations increase occupancy space three weeks March. Every hallway wired allow patients plugged in, lots mobile oxygen tanks racks, etc. rewired HVAC 50% hospital negative pressure, set triple ""ICU"" area (not really ICU). one thing can't space weeks months train nurses, train nurses become ICU nurses.

The money motivation insurance companies, hospitals nonprofit. people pay us insurance companies, pay bare minimum. run funded government, make ends meets, make payroll, buy (more expensive normal) supplies, pay power gas gas bills, buy food inpatients, buy drugs hand, service machines. Blame greedy Repubs blocked chance health care run public good, profit. response makes think either familiar scientific process understand all.

Peer reviewed findings? That's another thing doctors/scientists go they're believed. ... case aware detail, well. Yeah... want tk know sus means either. 

I'd rather intellectual... read... know... adult That‚Äôs exactly what‚Äôs going happen hospitals great. hospitals way empty usual...at least cal.. also areas see around state.  making grave mistake. power play. Absolutely peak retarded take, hope bury family members winter can‚Äôt go visit mother go another full week Chemo alone due hospitals no-visitor policys. Please wear mask don‚Äôt large gatherings! could 9 months in. Wow. Read study, reports it, especially proponents drug. *never* seen hope see study effectiveness drug dropped subjects 'analysis' died. Never ! 'study' unique experience. investigating drug used 'treat' disease often results death prove (sic) every drug everything else Sun effective strike dead. Here's link [a research. Here's quotation 'Results' (sic) total 26 patients received hydroxychloroquine 16 control patients. Six hydroxychloroquine-treated patients lost follow-up survey early cessation treatment. Reasons follows: three patients transferred intensive care unit, including one transferred day2 post-inclusion PCR-positive day1, one transferred day3 post-inclusion PCR-positive days1-2 one transferred day4 post-inclusion PCR-positive day1 day3; one patient died day3 post inclusion PCR-negative day2; one patient decided leave hospital day3 post-inclusion PCR-negative days1-2; finally, one patient stopped treatment day3 post-inclusion nausea PCR-positive days1-2-3. results presented therefore 36 patients (20 hydroxychloroquine-treated patients 16 control patients).

Let's see here. Start 26 subjects. Stroke three got sicker , went ICU, whose eventual fate unknown. Stroke another died even transferred ICU. Stroke another seems misdiagnosed (PCR - negative) - WISELY - left hospital likely catch disease. Finally stroke one person drug produced uncontrollable nausea, fate unknown. leaves 20 patients. Even 26 originally enrolled would totally insufficient gauge effectiveness treatment. 

Remarkable. Truly remarkable. takes politician grasping propaganda straws put credit 'results'. regret proposed investigation seems focused solely researcher question, include many others paved way him. 

Of course privileged hearing powers decided article meet criteria ""pertaining primarily coronavirus associated outbreak"". Yeah, surrrrre. Uhh yea this.... can't produce skilled workers thin air. You‚Äôre safe least safe person group exactly mentality people don‚Äôt get! word article makes much sense. much faster without SSL end-to-end encryption. Since people 99% chance survival... that'd REALLY BIG Thanksgiving dinner, statistically, likelihood even single death. 


The COVID infection fatality rate across population 0.27%. That's 1 370 people infected die.  article nothing fear-mongering. 


Here's reference statistic, btw: Hanukkah less concern IMO us celebrate already celebrated holidays zoom/at home prepared again. saw that! sick people saying maybe it‚Äôs lung cancer. don‚Äôt call relatives I‚Äôll soon etc...Absolute refusal could Covid. 

It amazing. seriously don‚Äôt think Covid real? spelled selfish wrong  Pretty much. in-laws type tell person sick allergies take benadryl. bedridden flu kept trying get take allergy medications telling used nature (we town West Virginia time). Since pandemic told virus bad, sick people need masks, people seem getting sick area, taking seriously.

I expect come visit. much beer, enough Tito‚Äôs. Unfortunately half country never one time child get put time try sneak out, given longer time trying avoid done first place.

That's basically we're stuck dealing literal toddlers.  perfect crossover, really. one able afford Christmas account economy tanking, 'gift' random objects estate! Happy Birthday, asshole. It‚Äôs highly dependent wear live well. Mask compliance spotty Florida live small blue area. places way worse mandates anything all. Let rephrase... work Reading article key. did. also screenshot them. No, Pfizer Moderna vaccines completed 3rd 4 stages. risky Yup, friend breast cancer doctor they're told work 100% capacity recoup losses. time, fighting hospital get PPE herself. people think funding coming think going exactly? Yes. Never gonna happen here. mouthwash kill virus within thirty seconds exposed it. worded like absolute hell, don‚Äôt need gargle within 30 seconds exposure. covid. absurd lock harder...when 40mm 10 deaths yesterday. Coming town huge pharmacautical plant employed couple 1000 people one point (including dad family members) deserve profit time limited patent drugs researched invented.

If interested company currently called Glaxo-Smith-Kline-Beecham, think, keep amalgamating. leading procucer early antibiotics 1950s well innovations NHS. mean there's good chunk South Dakota wearing masks hates BS (myself included). 

Also, large amount Native American tribes trying enforce rules virus particularly affected governor's unwillingness help. conservatives  originated china, ‚Äústudies‚Äù saying otherwise chinese funded evidence facts? fake news! 


^(/s) lost grandfather last year Thanksgiving. go see passed sick time. really ruin holiday. Ken Paxton still office? Holy shit... Well get herd immunity need, [according medical experts 70% population 230 million arguments sake. rate million week 219 (230-11) weeks 4 years. million day could save bunch time open country again. (last hopefully) administration trying get us faster. worry fact get infected medical community breaking point.

The sarcasm. mask, wash hands social distancing stay safe possible coming holidays. Good luck everyone going need it. problem U.S. needed stimulus. directed people unemployed. Instead blew everything once, gave people still working, stimulus payouts.


All shutdown many industries, would keep stimulus spent there.


And everyone knew expect another wave fall, could go well year. possibilities would explain brother tested negative. 

Let's break down:

First all. immune system something absolutely incredible. constantly attacked pathogens want make home bodies. reason sick time, innate immune system rapidly attacks neutralizes threats non-specific way. (in contrast adaptive immune system, slow specific means antibodies T-cells.) used work tsetse flies person would become sick bite infects person 60.000 trypanosomes (the pathogen causes sleeping sickness well equipped evade immune system). Otherwise body cope threat, amazing feat. Enveloped viruses, SARS-CoV2 pretty unstable human body expect amount viruses need get sick pretty high healthy person. That's get sick walking passed infected person, unless sneezes coughs near you. said:

Assuming brother took every precaution co-worker uncle (wearing masks, avoid taking much, air circulation), good chance exposed high enough viral load make sick.

Assuming brother wife socially distance (as normal marital relationship) wife tested positive, brother 99% certainty infected virus. takes one two weeks sufficient viral load appear measured PCR current swab technique. brother tested negative even two week period, expect already virus therefore immune. antibody test could shed light this, 100% reliable.

Other, less likely possibilities 1) already antibodies body another pathogen cross-react SARS-CoV2. happen even though chances low. 2) could human error: swabs taken test taken properly; RNA extracted efficiently sample. staff performing test properly trained rarely make mistakes, human errors happen. Sometimes staff even aware sample turn negative. Add related subreddits like r/coronaviruscanada vape bro Let be. can't fix stupid.

You let nature take course.

Their refusal wear masks practice social distancing self correcting problem.

Evolution take care them, population's IQ level higher gone. I‚Äôm sorry bad experience :( Gabapentin personally god send mental health anticonvulsant. $.02 case someone reading comment gets scared away... side effects tolerance medication always vary much depending person. me, anticonvulsant least bad side effects (vs depakote keppra among others) also amazing positive effects anxiety mood stabilization. person react differently :) flu also quite understatement as, flu also big killer USA.
Now without precautions you‚Äôll get flu SARS2 top it. doesn‚Äôt matter made actual argument people would scared death even literal flu

You‚Äôre totally reservation here. literal flu happens every year. Name year past decades people scared literal flu entire world shut multiple times it. take closer look source? dear friend - absolutely intelligent, science minded, rational, worthwhile person - stuck Mississippi, bothers me. Yeah, yeah, state unimaginable number complete idiots fools it. really rare bright people kind stuck, unable move various reasons. Keep mind jokes place go around. Dynamite kills faster. company's presence neighborhoods need vaccines. government combined sometimes cant wipe ass without debate think distribute vaccine. Everybody needs retreat safe space... supposed feel sorry people refused wear masks recent Sturgis bike festival?

They made bed, let lie it.  yep. quick 1 month open christmas period, rush back lockdown third wave. something certainly 'fishy' covid numbers. America. #1! üá∫üá∏....... /s started corner. Based reply dont think live Sweden idea society laws work. D614G mutation COVID-19 caused higher viral loads infectivity. believe mutation observed spring summer almost sequenced genomes mutation. may recent changes kept it.  Worst doctor ever? It‚Äôs schlub said wear mask...  Thank you! It‚Äôs big loss family. 4 year old wearing masks distancing since March, extended family wasn‚Äôt careful all. It‚Äôs scary watch. want say one hospital bed per 300 people? enough. Heh. would require actually session. Vos doesn‚Äôt care - I‚Äôm planning exit god forsaken state thing probably going save asses Federal intervention either lockdown via martial law. People listening. work full-time busy grocery market PA see sooooo much shit really stressing out. 

It seems like lot people care society collapses want wear mask limit exposure others.

They'll sorry need hospital bed available.... doctors matter. reported, Covid cause loss smell due effect nerves, congestion like respiratory viruses. people notice improvement within couple weeks. Good luck. Indeed suspicious. suspect keep artificially low, open December 'economic reasons' rush back lockdown 'third wave'. need coma ventilator ICU. many times deniers claimed best solution treat everyone like grown-ups tell truth? there's need mandates, laws, fines, etc...


But that's proven wrong, multiple times.


The places everyone sees mask usage U.S. there's mandates, enforcement's, fines, etc... anyone else numbers faked? lockdown (and even real lockdown) pulled peak quickly OMG rights gone üò¢üò∑ I'm moving North Korea Aussie here, road recovery coming stay strong you. vaccines showing promise useless without good roll program. 

Just hope next administration gets access need get done. Always enjoyed visiting states would good get back normal time soon.

We‚Äôve got put politics aside realize thing kill regardless ‚Äúsure‚Äù political position. somebody think fetuses?? would touch it
Their government would ""tell"" publish studies saying infected could produce antibodies 120 days infection. Given we‚Äôre seeing reinfection, word 90-120 day limit applies vaccines well? so, I‚Äôm thinking that, vaccine refusal distribution issues, may enough people continue irresponsible. 

It‚Äôll definitely help, unless vaccine show permanent antibody production least longer observed, post infection production times, won‚Äôt simple fix lot people treating as. Serious question.

I came home training yesterday body shaking feeling dizzy, fell asleep feel much better. Could haven‚Äôt drank even liter water day eaten one meal 2 hours basketball workout. Could result factors isolate myself? workout 2 others tested positive 2-4weeks back could get quickly? less whining means easier time stopping future pandemics well. noble enough goal. woman*

The evolution SARS-CoV-2 humoral response infected individuals remains poorly characterized. Here, performed longitudinal study sera 308 RT-qPCR+ individuals mild disease, collected two time-points, 6 months post-onset symptoms (POS). performed two anti-S one anti-N serology assays quantified neutralizing antibodies (NAbs). month 1 (M1), males, individuals 50 years age body mass index (BMI) 25 exhibited higher levels antibodies. Antibody levels decreased time. M3-6, anti-S antibodies persisted 99% individuals anti-N IgG measurable 59% individuals. decline anti-S NAbs faster males females, independently age BMI. results show serology tests less reliable overtime suggest duration protection SARS-CoV-2 infection vaccination different women men. 30-seconds. time boost immune system vitamins D, C, mineral Zinc. Healthy eating breathing exercises.  need lockdown NOW! time! üéµVaccine.... Vaccine.... VACCINE... VACCIIIIIINE üéµ count deaths every no-known cause.

Plenty people work second shift get work 10pm. logic nobody ever get takeout. conspiracy part ""only meant track us"" rather reality ""meant track us order track spread disease notify people may exposed"". difference information used public good access information restricted contact tracing purposes.

A system like could easily implemented personally identify people, still allowing proper contact tracing.

Imagine system everyday phone generates unique ID. Every couple minutes phone broadcast ID Bluetooth. phone keep track IDs IDs observes one month period. test positive push button phone app. phone take recently used IDs insert database online.

everyday phone downloads recent IDs database cross-checks IDS seen. sees IDs database seen Bluetooth, know potentially within 50 ft somebody tested positive. also know long ago exposure was, long within vicinity, potentially close based signal strength. catch passing somebody sidewalk likely would catch happen standing line checkout grocery store, train.

the app could even tell GPS coordinates discovered Bluetooth ID could make judgment call. example showed driving road saw ID there's pretty good chance car exposed. showed location work office know probably exposed. could go get covid test done, tested positive would push button would upload IDs database. on.

At point would personal information ever associated ID, could never know given idea one time.

Why somebody implemented something like beyond me. I'm unemployed too. 2 jobs waiting international borders open work again. 60k year welfare. expecting borders open March

Yes, people's lives affected differently. People complain 1 2 hour zoom calls 30 hour plus calls groups lead.

This shit temporary. always going like this. Shit = better later. went tough 14 week lockdown Melbourne. Mental health spiked, see friends family, fell depression again. community coming together we've enjoyed 18 days 0 cases 0 deaths.

 80% deaths years old.

92% deaths years old 

97% deaths years old.


With current estimations vaccine numbers, could vaccinate everyone year 2020, would decrease deaths 80%. often think back first time heard new virus starting spread Wuhan thinking ""Huh, like beginning movies foreshadow virus intro everything's still normal. ain't movie."" enough make small mental note checked back every couple weeks update came in.

Then Italy started going shit mental note turned ""Aw fuck me, jinx it"" that's amazing  Here's personal experience:

I called clinic area Janssen trial, scheduled screening month advanced. couple days sent documentation.

The day screening showed up, filled consent form, gave identification, gave medical history, filled W9 payment, etc. documentation made clear exit study time reason. payment structure unexpected, totaling $1575 stay trial end. Essentially, every in-person visit phone checkup resulted payment. Even exiting study early results payment.

I given physical (height/weight, heart, breathing, reflexes, eyes checked).

Then asked wanted proceed immediately ""second visit"" included injection. agreed, took blood sample nasal swab PCR test. signed app referred ""diary"". gave kit included various forms measurement track redness swelling (a ruler target measured diameter). thermometer box thermometer sleeves, two take-home PCR kits (one nasal swab one cheek swab) case think get infected, fingertip oximeter. showed use it.

Next injection. Quick mostly painless. moved room placed observation 30 minutes. sent home.

The ongoing instructions fill diary twice day 8 days. included symptom questionnaire, redness/swelling measurements injection site, temperature check. reported mild redness called about, told way could even spot injection site. Nothing serious, symptoms (pretty sure got placebo).

After 8 days two diary entries per day, switches two diary entries per week. app notifies when, asks symptom checks now.

In total 6 in-person visits, 2 technically day. followup visits get less frequent, 1-month checkup, 3-month checkup, 6-month checkup, 1-year checkup, 2 long term over-the-phone checkups 2022. 1-month checkup next me. still defend ""wait see"" approach though. Damn near *every* potential pandemic tends start China, fizzle out. Hell, think Spanish Flu may originally started China (it's one several potential sources).

What unforgivable complete lack response spread neighboring countries, US.

I can't post thoughts without violating rule 1. I‚Äôm sure man one trusted previously , claimed thing, absolves everything prior . 


I don‚Äôt believe really.

What‚Äôs argument? can‚Äôt get hfnc Swedish non-ICU, isn‚Äôt one reasons counting as? making bold statements without backing up.

Such Denmark Germany. countries publish stats people hospital ICU. Many also separate number ventilators see ventilated subset. posted example yourself, ‚Äúsuch as‚Äù Germany per link, example.

I put (most?) question mark don‚Äôt know many enough majority. Thank you. actually want old version, think there's way took nearly 20 years (the length original patent) figure could use smaller gauge needle use preservative burn upon injection.

Essentially, make tweaks get new patent! 20 years unbelievable profits! ($7000+ per month per patient) going challenged ignored.
 
The government tell folks wear fucking home. one friend keeps insisting Sweden right handling Covid herd immunity approach. getting outraged something admit understand. See therapist. eradicated influenza yet we've lot longer. much better management now, though.  Wisconsin enters chat says ""hold beer. smoking UK positivity rate maybe catch deaths soon!"" Could link got info? Every source I've found says highly accurate mention high false positivity rate.  feel like death excessive death gap large Brazil Chile due infrastructure etc place. Although real death rate UK higher, Chile Brazil's likely much higher know, it‚Äôs short form saying vote out. like Trump fired.

Including MERs paper right (gone 3 years, probably graph showing decline 6 months somewhere there). healthcare worker enrolled clinical trial testing right now. Effective viruses reason think help covid. frustrating, done March/April, things would lot better. thing going keep floating around US everybody gets board serious it. *THAT'S* one get infected attended riot 10 PM! Lol truth  what, pray tell? federal government issue mandate States listen. States issue mandate counties listen. Counties issue mandate cities listen. Cities issue mandate, police listen. Police issue mandate, people listen. mean, food anyone go do. ALWAYS sick people coming store. One favorites last flu season ""everyone house sick except shopper."" assume person sick days later. Slowly, slowly creeping toward actual effective measures. Maybe year 2036, Ohio mandatory mask mandate five-day shutdown get ahead thing! That‚Äôs unpleasant reality AIRBORNE virus. PEOPLE DIE. 100% foolproof method containment. Masks help slow spread, although much debatable. Eventually, everyone exposed COVID across globe, weak either fortunate recover, unfortunate succumbed, humanity stronger. Ready face next line. Fear nothing help. Media sensationalism nothing help. Common sense hard look reality situation pushes us forward.

And yes, hope happy thanksgiving. too. Yes. Also documented immunity SARSCOV2 influenced disease severity well. coronvira really matter relation immunity opposed SARSCOV2 Thanksgiving, hospitals many Pits. gave u facts stay indoors forever evergreened drug longer original. Potentially alternations may side effects apparent many years.

Of course real drug innovation good thing, typically builds work University later commercialised. Regardless, treating something innate within Japanese people extremely dangerous. detected mirror? Good job! Deaths per capita UK surpassed USA days ago, UK's rate really close surpassing Chile's Brazil's well. Followed rapid increase Italy France. telling change.org petition change world?

dang. Earliest we‚Äôre going get kind effective response federal government new administration takes over. Yes, also ""loophole"" use, restaurants ""serving time"" allowed sell alcohol. ends 22.00 everywhere, 30 min serving time ended venue must empty stil dont listen ya, troll? Thats ok. keep talking ur condescending drivel....  Yet another dumbass detected.  Stop crying wtf I'm surprised reply insinuation. fan discussing charitable self-serving, sake argument, donated charity. DeWine taking away MineCraft accounts home 9:30. pandemic high levels infection, basal levels circulating virus keep antibodies high previously exposed, recovered patients. true, 5 state higher deaths per idea US testing enough completely false. took time get setup March/April since highest number tests done world. also part reason case numbers high testing catching many people virus. point expect different per county basis? Like places it‚Äôs safe use masks, workout gym? Louisiana best south, bars closed summer...unlike Florida.

Wish could block guys now. No, McConnell specifically. house passed bill months ago. Rather pass competing legislation reconcile differences usual way, said publicly 15-20 members unlikely support bill whatsoever, warned Trump striking deal house shortly election. ""Both sides"" acting bad faith here, think are, paying enough attention. sad see. like people care community around them

Restrictions suck work allow restrictions relieved sooner dudes really pulling bootstraps, admirable! /S look comment section mainstream news source youtube, catastrophe modern US tax system gathers funds share wealth rich average FDR tax system. It‚Äôs effective rates taxation, looks paper. exactly big fan huge crowds drunk college students. get way many sicknesses school-age kids love share germs. world needs reconsider fewer pandemics. too. Question, migraines post ""really bad flu?"" DIL (who sick March get test) severe migraines several times month before. also fatigue issues come go. I'm posting due sentiment seems come regarding therapeutics. think agree vaccines special category RCTs really waiting on. However, comes therapeutics, can't wait science thorough way come through. 73,000 Americans currently hospitalized many worldwide. RCTs luxury can't afford wait trying offer best care suffering right *now*. type environment, observational studies kinds valid comes pursuing treatment right now. Front line medicine requires it. purpose posting vaccines, unreasonably requiring RCT taking potential therapeutic seriously. rather dense let perfection enemy good. I'm sure citizens city think it. yeah shit. Europe doesn‚Äôt double population North America. addition US Canada, North America includes Mexico, Panama, Honduras etc. 23 sovereign states asked source, quick look paper makes pretty clear they‚Äôre talking someone dealing covid thinks they‚Äôve recovered worst symptoms still yet come.

I also like googled ‚Äúflorida 17 percent reinfected‚Äù jack shit came ‚ÄúThere cult ignorance United States, always been. strain anti-intellectualism constant thread winding way political cultural life, nurtured false notion democracy means 'my ignorance good knowledge.‚Äù

-Isaac Asimov stop, you‚Äôre embarrassing remember cities dangerous everyone running away country? looks like time head back cities logic, science, facts prevail mine x2 no. told u get lost, it. *proceeds tear Ivanka up* lot Republicans/conservatives ran message backing Trump matter what. blindly followed plan nothing late. would expressed seriousness towards action instead politics, I'd wager would followed suit state level. states took early action, atleast wanted to, could greatly benefited earlier federal assistance. 

Some probably still would done anything, we'd lot less people claiming hoax. Right? live New Orleans astounding good we've been. bars closed summer. reopened to-go drinks mid-September...and past weekend opened patrons. mayor stop quick rates go up. already warned us... talking destroying everything tossing lives trash? make year without gatherings?

You're going run hills see someone asymptomatic mild Covid look feel totally fine.

If see someone massive hemorrhaging nonstop diarrhea one Ebola would have, likely avoid getting anywhere near them, hence limiting virus' potential spread others. Also comment section Valley News Live Facebook page. Nice like year ago... happy covid birthday?  Yes, Pfizer wants distribution. Moderna rely US distribution. Canadian here, please skip Thanksgiving, us paying price Hell yeah brother! Here's drinking &amp; stinking! often think whole collective reaction Covid cultish mass delusion masking suicidal ideations. another post SD nurse mentioned Covid patients was/is caring screaming us hoax. Mean, belligerent...and exactly would come expect.

I worried healthcare system people relies upon. local authorities area. got recently replaced Covid failures, desperate show masters Beijing totally ball now.

Then Reuters possibly mis-reported saying. Local Mandarin reports talk Covid found packaging distribution warehouse stored meat NZ, Argentina, somewhere else. specifically country's meat packaging contained virus. AMA created physician shortage 70s increase doctor salaries. led people entering medicine newly outrageous salaires. 

When money social status motivator, it‚Äôs wonder many quit shit gets hard. think rural hospitals ever recover this. hospitals policies thing turn doctors considering rural settings, bizarrely entitled selfish attitudes majority rural populations seemingly adopted age Trump. Wrong. Look graphs. LOL think help coming? own. would happy got hazard pay. Rapid tests reliable I'm confused prioritization individuals 65 vulnerable immunocompromised; vaccines even going approved early stages? thought safety data far gathered healthy younger adults. Mental health issues contagious. Covid is. 

Sorry sorry. Rapid tests WAAAAY less reliable consistent PCR tests beginning lot critics studies, including ethical committee.

Case reports literally SECOND LOWEST FORM EVIDENCE PYRAMID EVIDENCE-BASED MEDICINE study selects patients Covid-19 neurological symptoms. proves literally zero, since pre-selected patients both.

Edit: people, need get rid attitudes make clear Guys, start! research proves combat Coronavirus good research indeed. Stop stupid comments mouthwashing lungs obviously point here. point certain chemicals within mouthwash killing coronavirus could lead development using certain chemical compounds vaccines example.

Unless something contribute fighting COVID-19 yourself, please badmouth research.  Gonna try convince brother take it. seem trust vaccines due crap sees YouTube feel like I've made progress him. wholesome person!! stupidity 

this cult mind set even smart people get sucked cult. Gotta love They're already helping spread COVID far wide... They're right. think they'll infect, car? feels like we‚Äôre reaching light end tunnel, please let madness end kinda feel like undeclared sarcasm helps create echo chamber people identify thought.

Glad correct side though. Good point. 

I guess needed someone else tell me, feel like I'm one people know circle taking seriously, getting point can't tell I'm taking *too* seriously. Hopefully people's governor gets boot reelection campaign... fact makes think goofy studies ? hypothesis infections may less virulent due lower viral load masking distancing think hypothesis may dubious well.

This actually quite likely, given Japan's outlook. one hand testing numbers absolute bollocks, other, zero social distancing closures here, mask compliance around 90%, theorized lower viral load. Japanese people get sick, tend keep going work anyway (masked up), means probably lot people here, serious enough warrant taking time work get tested (in typical mentality here). Add fact they're still really testing people admitted hospitals serious cases, see general population seems taking well (as in, probably lot mild asymptomatic cases requiring hospitalization, likely due compliance masking up).  thats great even vaccines point get herd immunity right may challenge 

If lucky herd immunity low 60% may reach vaccines. much higher that? Good fucking luck getting people take vaccine therefore may reach herd immunity. look good...the demise humanity humanity lol true, impassioned plea &amp; stimulus money going actual nonessential workers &amp; small business needed stop working/shut would probably enough. run esophagus lungs, twice day? God bless USA! place Health officials, tell public resist guidelines health officials. natural law would actually population limiting factor (ie herd immunity). human behavior might create artificial limit - perhaps wave stupid something like that. infected probably least regard safety, remaining population progressively cautious. took internalized mean claim want woman president, like candidates subconscious/internalized misogyny No, CULT! seeing, hearing happening! point I'd get bloody heroin, always there. Ooof bother saving people? understand, want it, choose believe it. Pfizer vaccine still submitted emergency approval week? Trump really could set narrative saved many lives. could come advocating mask use spring modeled behavior wearing one.

He would reelected.

But refused. 

I hope rots hell. wonder side effects reliable indicator whether one got vaccine vs placebo would happy this? Challenge excepted Everyone infecting 2/10 conservative - people generally infect less 20% household members. really make better though.  heads up, seeing spike search volume Covid testing Mass past couple days. usually means you‚Äôll see big uptick reported cases couple weeks out. careful you‚Äôre MA. About? care downvotes, nobody linked legitimate article shows strong evidence Covid **causing** neurological effects. clear mean cause neurological effects, evidence lacking Swab nose solution Povidone - Iodine water. article hand rn, recommended solution. know eyes. cover outbreak initially, things bad US there's way hell could cover up. Light. skin light?  Ok, that's stupid. Seriously, US thinking human apply business hours. Breaks proven improve efficiency learning.
And moved double class length doubled break time, stealing break, plain simple (both students). phase 3 trails, distributed general population complete, emergency use authorization permits offered people high-risk exposure (like healthcare workers). Ugh. feel you, laws... 

My husband drug addict. put foot letting daughter house unless sober. Oh God, outrage got laws believe precious son would ever pick needle... blamed taking away daughter. still would see her, supervised visits, good conscience leave two alone. 

He died drug overdose two years ago,which also apparently fault. I'm still bitter feel much empathy crazy covid inlaw stories I've reading lately.  good news double chances developing depression anxiety catching COVID! hospital enough masks cover patients staff, Covid ones. want restrictions die hill chose. t, but, but, but, they're ""pro-life"" ones!!!! least Trump would come COVID taskforce give little updates try act like something. even gave act leaving freefall. want timeline. it. turd medical doctor?

*I bot, action performed automatically.

Stupidity test must done covid test Little harsh. Man, someone insist, multiple times, exponential growth county. zero data. argument data apparently misleading.

People just...ugh.  Thank Rupert Murdoch Roger Ailes primarily.

Trump much symptom disease itself. You, well. article around mental issues 18% starting believable. nice day, mate!  Seeking understand--in opinion, 150 person houseparty still pass ""homeowner decides invited house"" criteria? Yeah I‚Äôm exact boat. city ‚Äúopen,‚Äù majority people know aren‚Äôt going restaurants bars, getting hair cut, putting social gatherings next year. I‚Äôm trying discount anyone mental health deteriorating. Even normalcy regular schedule stripped away. tough time us. doesn‚Äôt mean stop. Trump give shit you. He's purposely letting everyone die. rallies demonstrations get, people kill. Sounds like flatearthers way reasoning. saying better _not_ report side effects hand? better people expect side effects experience this?

I say people know advance they're experience. There's big risk backlash, people refuse take _any_ vaccine, even few, no, side effects. Transparency vital here. Dr Ben Carson qualified... Wait 1,300 total?? That's garbage wtf. much money pumped research think test subjects would get least like 5k something... know that... like... nvm. useless. Anti vax much smaller media represents can't really cover average joe takes vaccine meant sarcastically. leadership federal level. doesn‚Äôt help politicians select consider ok limits. don‚Äôt think large family gatherings wise mine smaller year, see people telling politicians kick rocks comes limiting amount people they‚Äôre inviting thanksgiving. pulling emergency brake pretty reckless way stop car. bad metaphor acknowledgement overreaction?  Given food bank lines, I'm afraid lot people worried things far deeper gifts. need restrictions, that's good fine come plan impact... one we'll get later point. Oxford/AstraZeneca: said UK could expect receive **4m** 100m vaccine doses ordered Oxford university AstraZeneca end year. 

But mainly delaying production delay stage 3 trials. produced 30 million September, millions doses would sit storage end December, shortening shelf life significantly. don‚Äôt care anymore I'm healthy fear virus. without vaccine life go back normal want life go back normal. social distancing, closed bars, watching live soccer matches again.

By way rather fun weird experience see everybody bashing antivaxxers untill 2019. Remember vAcCiNeS cAuSe AuTisM memes? really really really need people take vaccine suddenly lot people take it. still rude think isn't? Hopefully get happy enough life feel stranger saying said dumb thing rude. dumb times, accept time. Agreed. Tell us truth prepare. know, like back February Trump found virus‚Äô true nature lied. Even Australia, positive rate never 2% still caught &lt;50% cases. public holiday (11th, WW1 armistice), many people half week off. Labs closed, people habits changed, could cause less affluence go testing. least America accounting high amounts anti vaxxers otherwise resistance quickly produced vaccine

I'm saying wrong also think gonna simple think  Toothpaste too? kind like soap.  debunked weeks ago
  do! Thanks! Maybe, maybe not. schools definitely reflect community. control community spread, see spreading schools. issue community cases exploding, isn‚Äôt right time reopen. can‚Äôt ever reopen. Hopefully community control. Travel bubble Hongkong starts Nov 22! Seriously, right? scariest ones chilling truth core. residents screaming night Wuhan, doctors pleading nurses dying, example. 

There torrents videos China.Citizen journalists died show world. us did. 

Like you, showed family. struck deep, momentarily. Dream-barrier stifles back denial quickly. 

And year later. videos. doctors nurses speak English, folks west - turns - deplorable beyond comprehension, regard response. 

I see videos Wuhan citizens pulled street beaten non-compliance. Compelling old peoples little 'game' get together. could see police officers rolling undercover old-timers gambling places. Smash up. 

How deny that? Truism. tots pears family. really believe scott recognise impact Well, hope get happy enough life stop rude strangers internet. look areas low hospitalizations, carried on, system might crash ""EvEr nOTiCe ANti-VaXxers aArE GEtTting siCK"",ü§£ü§¨

#chemtrailsinthe5G Ive never preached seizure medical equipment hospitals supply chain. I've also never suggested political retaliation/gain. lies solely trump GOP.

Please not, also **not** send elsewhere greater need. given private companies friendly trumps, sold **at markup** originally purchased it. Biden office time distribution general population starts approve Please point said vaccine funded Americans? Like really? say that? said taht Pfizer mainly operated USA. 


gotta love reddit God, get this. 

My husband eat huge amount times usually anniversary, birthday, Valentine's day things like that. I'm main cook 'special' nights either us couple go out, whereas husband's birthday days days usually chooses fancy meal cook opposed going out. 'his' nights looked different really Anniversary hard me. That's kind tricky unfortunately. eradicated need follow measures make sure can't get back unnoticed. would hav restrict control traffic crossing borders, also need highly effective system track, trace isolate new infections possible contacts. pretty strict corona surveillance will. getting place within month two along hard lock down.. that's political, financial, societal logistical nightmare.

Kinda sit boat europe. bandaiding way that's pretty much have. Better know front go thinking big deal get hit next day thinking you‚Äôve poisoned tricked want go back second shot. Warn people know expect. Plan need recovery day two. RIP, Alex :( see commercials ‚Äúz-shield‚Äù advertise face shield alternative masks... Idk legal me, deluge, eh? state required list Covid 19 cause death health issue caught me, state lot elderly, tend health issues people, could lead under-reporting elderly Covid-19 deaths. Fair. incorrect one way. Yep

If see venues events requiring proof vaccination maybe 1-2 years complete lifting restrictions going get lot people vaccinated habit No, mouthwashes used test alcohol free. [It's believed COVID may able trigger onset type 1 tends develop childhood. may start seeing significant rise cases soon. use vehicle side road somehow? cars cramped use inside them. Pool noodles always available, pipe insulation could probably work too. camp shower privacy curtains? used public places? would real American way Two parliaments, yes. Michigan GOP lawmakers going impeach now, apparently. sarcastic sincere? can‚Äôt really tell lmao ones without 20%+ alcohol?

Regardless, referred 'mouthwashes' chemical.

You can't correct here. need dumb. hospitals mostly record lows. Santa clara county 35% capacity. would normally double time year. 4% patients covid. 

I disagree ensure hospitals get overwhelmed, hospitals fine....actually jeopardy going lack patients. CA horrifying health care avoidance problem right tried match ranger big iron hip! specifically talking Listerine? üòâ definitely don‚Äôt fund schools like they‚Äôre essential. pay teachers like they‚Äôre essential. Infection rates among kids tenfolded past month here. right, can't 100% pin point schools even though rest shut down. Well radiology also encompasses many imaging techniques radiotherapy, certainly talking nonsense outside area.

Which make trust radiologist much, doctors know limits knowledge. called specialisation reason. need rude, mate.
 Cardiff University report said mouthwashes containing least 0.07% cetypyridinium chloride (CPC) showed ‚Äúpromising signs‚Äù able defeat virus. hello 10th amendment, prevents federal government it

Technically *grants* states ability it. wrong, though. That's I'm afraid of. feed anti vaxxers. think hold hospitals filling though. they're hospitalizing critical patients, greater percentage hospitalized going die.

If states get it, things get really bad. Glad state saw headed acted now. 30 minutes we'll heavy restrictions more. think bounce back, learn lesson hard way. Real gamer moment remember seeing shit telling wife we're fucked that's resort get things control. I'm surprised actually period people staying home beginning. Something tells type symptoms confirmed normal, drive lots people away taking vaccine already saw middle American say ‚ÄúCoastal elites problem!‚Äù totally dismiss everything.

Yes no.

My aunt, die-hard Christian supporter specific candidate, \*certainly\* type normally would downplay COVID. tiny town one hit early (a church choir got sick March). takes virus refreshingly seriously.  Depends entirely national policy. Canada prioritizing remote communities vaccines treatments least access real emergency care event outbreak.

In areas less geographic disparity, probably go regional hub hospitals rather local clinics. Agreed - shit situation overall. I've struggling active (and usual slump). Hopefully able get break holiday timeframe. Stay safe. :) ok, bleach mean get that, - believe doctors know better, there?

If know better, treat themselves, since know doctors apparently.  Christmas July

So family won‚Äôt die denied help government opened shop early august. ... there's many nurses doctors. society deeply sick head. Damn straight\* is. clear, care country music genre, love Dolly (and Hank Williams Sr. -- Sr.)

\*Apologies LGBTQ+ community. better compared tyrannical European governments . It‚Äôs Italy. Check Spain, France, UK EU countries. per capita calculation. Italy, people use masks, maintain distance follow rules, mostly, yet cases deaths per capita US moment, people don‚Äôt care masks

I actually think US isn‚Äôt worse EU countries. EU population, despite older average, also much healthier, yet deaths per capita. cannot blame Trump deaths, otherwise need blame every single EU president except Iceland guess. ... that‚Äôs little extreme. ohh..thought didnt effect kids?? WTF allowing get infected?!? Like Walt Disney? want say I‚Äôm virologist, although know decent amount taking pre-pharmacy courses involve infectious diseases.

But understanding viruses indeed able hang longer regions parts body, decades. Zika, instance, known able survive men‚Äôs semen six months. poses sexual transmission threat, lead reinfection, body eventually eliminate zika virus. confirmed cases bit limited testing capacity, numerous regions reached started prioritize testing risk groups people health/care settings severe symptoms. might clear positivity rate increases total cases remains same, statistics last week available Thursday think. understand need hospitals collapse more.than covid!! Winter coming car accidents, heart attacks. know terrify everyone. Even get wave, health care field big trouble. asking much people desperately need one day. take Xanax needed anxiety. noticed don‚Äôt exercise twice per week get frequent attacks. suspect this, even depression, could attributed sedentary lifestyle people engage pandemic don't, that's waste perfectly good gun. Almost Europe disaster. It‚Äôs much accomplishment Dolly voice "" hey y'all vaccine everyone ..except whore Jolene. "" Mental health issues also become much defined medically, baseline compare since 30 years ago we've classified mental health disorders would've called hyperactive. KNOW doesn;t work. nothing. Silly ass article file juvenile journalism Yes know families can't spread diseases /s  friends died, big brain aware, standing front cars cars *intentionally blocking ambulances getting fucking hospital*. standing could fucking save lives. lets recap: **50,000** deaths US military personnel 10 year Vietnam war, terrible! **Four** American deaths Benghazi, horrible! **2,977** American deaths 9-11 attacks, horrible!

USA deaths covid 19 date (and going everyday) **247,000!** 

But now...NO BIG DEAL! actual ****!? Mild cases OK give elderly family member die it. Vandy probably getting percentage. Typically works. happen some.

Some others lose family members.

Some others get sick survive.

Some end unscathed, practice lead least one former 3 someone else.

Not something good scenario. Let spread live alone, unwise would isolate 14 days, get test, negative drive spend holidays two parents home? Obviously zero risk relatively okay? maybe? looks like deaths increasing due seasonality. 70 mainly people 80s 90s dying. People likely diseases already next end lives...
Sweden demonstration closing activities young people insanity completely useless. Many people saved part paid debts instead spending it. Saving money bank stimulate economy like consumption does.

Your lung muscles work harder overcome extra resistance.

Whether \*meaningful\* impact real story. Sounds like optional vaccine like flu vaccine. Irrelevant. Blaming source something inevitable asinine. shitty response deserves blame.

Also, look much corona source dealing now. Even considering numbers aren‚Äôt super accurate way better most. right live fear, we're vaccinated.

I hope COVID deniers forego vaccine. Google translation :

It seem like criticized women. Example Dr Scott tweeted rise her, PA governor. issued similar closers.  lungs would even tricky. lot risk management sure. 1% catching virus single event high me. seen people? majority srem think covod go lives, maskless  year everyone throw jackets thanksgiving outside, year. Big tables, small groups, wear mask go inside go bathroom likely? literally unlikely 17 infected Rand doesnt undergraduate degree pass licensing exams created certification board... Idk states, Tennessee shot normal 2k cases 5k yesterday 8k. We‚Äôre growing pretty fast guess they‚Äôre time catch up. Halloween parties  That‚Äôs sad. Good luck you, Mister. Considering saw 3 local gas station hanging maskless maskless rednecks, would agree probably would say they‚Äôre responsible asked.

That's beside point lung working 100% taking less oxygen first place. still going get shortness breathe.

That would last time saw person. patience anything anymore *especially* kind bullshit. right, know plenty democrats liberals refuse whats right too. boils selfishness basically. dont want lives inconvenienced. Damn end results. living fear taking necessary precautions stay safe two different things. We've conversation almost everyone family point. stay strong great job. feel like massive zoom thanksgiving grand old time.  First line: ""No 8 people per group allowed Sweden's restaurants""   
I know count 10 8. also respect social distance all. No! Wow... still gotten..??? 

No... none ok. 

""None them""... case clear. That's weird worms open. wait first business start screening people AIDS diseases disproportionately affect minorities. Gee, sort enforcement mechanism make sure follow rules. Funerals related deaths due heart disease would likely deaths due covid. CDC estimates 650,000 Americans die year heart disease. Media sensationalism driving covid fear. People need get grip blindly rely broadcast Facebook ‚Äúnews‚Äù information. many funerals Canada far big thanksgivings? I'm sure large get togethers. Guys, please take one christmas thanksgiving visiting family, almost certain next year time, Covid really huge problem. China welded people apartments. spraying sanitizer streets people, taking temps everywhere, aggressive contact tracing forced quarantine. one person allowed go get food week. drones country telling citizens put mask.

What doesn‚Äôt even compare. No, no...they're going go big funerals. folks limited capacity understand things.

They probably going wash hands anyways throughout day lunch, dinner, etc. masks restricting travel wanna see? won‚Äôt requires extra effort beyond already going do, it‚Äôs something authority figure don‚Äôt like telling do. Totally agree! one touched deeply, definitely lesson many adults, including myself, use.  want family. see ton Democratic protestors, thousands them. media never condemns them. God forbid family come visit. It‚Äôs joke. I‚Äôm want CCP coming karma! highly, highly doubt it.  Already showed initial NY outbreak Italy. videos pictures already. one gives shit countries afford subsidizing national defense. Last December got flu. 30 time, BMI 28, moderate drinker, otherwise healthy. felt terrible 4 days felt better 2.. bronchitis started. sick 7 weeks, February. missed much work emptied savings account 3 months buying first house. truly terrifying miserable awful.

Mandatory isolation contacts mandatory hospitalization upon testing positive (even asymptomatic) also played big role. Go look countries socialized healthcare vastly improved quality care tell aim for.

The problem government runs VA, problem conservatives would rather sabotage VA let veterans die rather admit they're wrong. many run local level, national level. saying hospitals run local agencies national ones? two completely different things. one time year makes sense wear mask, fucking dildos didn't. swear. eat whole pumpkin pie  never chance. completely agree. I've working looking everything positivity.  Webex sucks claim sounding desperate. Like they're trying convince *themselves* ""just flu."" governor gets go huge parties lawmakers Maui conference, supposed listen stay home? C‚Äômon bro, that‚Äôs stupid. I‚Äôm going gather family. masks Everyone thinks they‚Äôre ‚Äúsafe‚Äù bet aren‚Äôt. 

I‚Äôm ‚Äúsafe‚Äù. go grocery store. make unnecessary trips. Yet still people take masks store noses hanging out. even though safe, people aren‚Äôt. became exposed COVID, even though ‚Äúsafe‚Äù, wasn‚Äôt showing symptoms I‚Äôd unknowingly take family. 

On hand, COVID fatigue real. example, many fatigue (or deniers including seems) think ‚Äúwell state/county/town allows eat restaurant must safe.‚Äù ask someone they‚Äôve safe, say yes. Yet ‚Äúsafe‚Äù ‚Äúsafe.‚Äù 

I‚Äôve seen relatively reasonable family. ground rules two weeks leading thanksgiving 6 immediate family members. Yet two thought ‚Äúsafe‚Äù go dinner birthday didn‚Äôt think tell us recuse holiday. uninvite seeing social media posts.

So might denier, I‚Äôm taking zero chances. virus spreading like wildfire we‚Äôve invested much time energy (8 months social distancing, working home, seeing family friends) let now. It‚Äôs almost it‚Äôs two different sets people saying things you‚Äôre trying get argue other. Thank posting article. It‚Äôs excellent.

I'm saying Florida well, strictly going numbers better would've expected. 


#HOWEVER#

that game testing data reporting negative tests negative, first time positive tests positive, subsequent positive tests (after someone tests positive 1st time) negative.

So, using metrics, test 10 people every day week, 3 positive every single test, Florida would report 4.3% positive, 3 positives 70 tests. there's that.

Nursing COVID patients fairly intense terms repositioning, cleaning, line management, million tasks critical care nurses daily basis. Note things necessitate physically room. Also, spend much time patients generally let us know think somethings them. 


 MD side there's lot monitor flowsheets know patients. natural history COVID ARDS soooooooo slow, often days/weeks vent. even order x-rays anymore there's nothing change regardless bad infiltrates are. generally give good lookover come examine person there's big change need room (rapid change vent settings=US pneumothorax). Also room proning examine flip them. 


Going daily basis 'just because' get information need RN charts wastes lot time equipment. understand part system, waited first 95 positive cases calculated efficacy that, makes sure number go higher time goes by? example, maybe next month another 95 cases test positive, time less meaningful split?

I guess another question I'm is, validate efficacy long term? Saying induces long term immunity. Well that's month never get back got 200 virus cases United States got 100,000 cases. Holy cow. huge difference response. even celebrate Thanksgiving first place anyone know long take reach non first world countries? feel like I‚Äôll wait 2025 :( First thing thought well!

I'm wondering... going forward, what's going go Olympics schedule? going summer Olympics off-year (say, 2022) return previous schedule (which would put next one 2024 normally would been), hold summer Olympics whichever year next becomes viable (again, let's say 2022, I'm saying actually viable) go every four years (so, 2022, 2026)?

Or would skip 2024? vulnerable vaccinated, hospitalization rate death rate plummet within weeks.

The threat overwhelmed hospitals end.

And point, current restrictions end. afraid physical retaliation?  favorite turtle case need trying times, judicial appointments course though - it‚Äôs months. check good one month rent. Done. agree! Especially since several family members attending Thanksgiving dinner either 60+ 65+. want accidentally make MIL family member ill may covid know it.

My husband, kids, considered ""low risk"", would prefer none us get sick, possible, especially since long-term effects completely understood point.

I'm disappointed, since love spending time sides family, worth making pandemic even worse. wouldn't, alternative approved vaccine could taking instead, lose nothing taking placebo. earth come conclusion? Thanks answering. Looks like varies lot. Yes, makes sense! nuts. Well, keep hiding house want.

It's interesting ranges varied. would go giving award someone covid vaccine? There's multiple companies producing it. Sounds like right timeline then. curious regarding COVID vaccine.

Would people COVID last year considered last priority? Especially asymptomatic. could see case severe COVID case, would high risk?

By [**Meg | [mwingerter@denverpost.com](mailto:mwingerter@denverpost.com) [**Alex | [aburness@denverpost.com](mailto:aburness@denverpost.com) | Denver PostNovember 16, 2020 7:34 p.m.

Colorado state county officials talks add new level [state COVID-19 ‚Äî highest, stay-at-home level ‚Äî new numbers released Monday showed cases hospitalizations continue climb.

An announcement expected Tuesday.

It‚Äôs unclear what, exactly, new level would require, though half-dozen sources confirmed plan told Denver Post designation won‚Äôt restrictive stay-at-home order Gov. Jared Polis issued March. sources spoke condition anonymity details haven‚Äôt finalized.

At least six Denver-area counties ‚Äî Denver, Boulder, Broomfield, Adams, Jefferson Arapahoe ‚Äî involved talks, sources say. much Reddit, Lol. Melting face Arizonan. Wait talking again? Can't lose play m'man  They're believing they're dying coronavirus, covid-19 Thats funny googled it, now, nothing came it. even tried? doubtful, want spread lies. agree. However, minds changing. Shorter attention spans, need instant gratification, skewed self-worth Internet-based egos, less focus personal interaction, absent parents families. saying prove relationship, saying we‚Äôve changed could taking toll. We've able avoid lot weather, IMO. majority people going completely stop seeing people -- see people outside makes lot difference. 

Like, meeting friend beach weekend. We're going drink coffee, wear masks, sit apart, watch waves. getting tested tomorrow. possible colder weather. Note actual valid reasons people get vaccinated. Immune conditions make unsafe, example. exactly anti-vaxxers problem‚Äîif vaccination level population drops certain level herd immunity stops working, people can‚Äôt ever get vaccinated (against measles, example) risk (as well babies haven‚Äôt gotten vaccine yet).

And abstract sense, hypoxia also kills you, brain, brain cells can't function without oxygen. shot head, brain fails send signals heart, heart stops beating, brain fully dies hypoxia. 

If someone shot head (provided thousand pieces), hypothetically keep brain alive (i.e. cells functioning, brain ""works"") hooked machine providing perfect circulation nutrition? hydrostatic shock destroy cells immediately completely stop working?

Also, gsw that's lethal headshot, definitely die hypoxia problem is, many people already see hear rising death count buy narrative counts artificially inflated.

Sadly beginning exponential growth. cold continues work way south, it‚Äôs going get ugly - fast. cases explode, it‚Äôs everywhere witnessed Wuhan, Italy, NYC, etc. 

Problem US, we‚Äôre going many booms happening quite period time (I expect end Feb+ unless states get serious restrictions Gov gets serious stimulus).

I‚Äôve following closely since Jan studied ass regarding science, history pandemics, name it. Never million years think we‚Äôd Nov. pure hell watching everything turned political financial instead putting American lives first.

The dumbing down, programming, manufactured division, psychological warfare campaigns Twitter Facebook (anyone remember those?), operation confusion, wild see put people consume content, reacted it.

Oh well. individuals spend time family holidays: Why? happiness dependent seeing somebody certain day year? makes one particular day important willing justify away risk everyone's health? makes Thanksgiving Christmas Day important random day next July?

Then sacrificed went get uncle tested positive, 6 hour drive him.

So... kinda makes sense death rate Sweden less half?  think because, many, we've moved beyond simply ""lockdowns suck"" unemployment, poverty, traumatic isolation, mental health problems, relationship breakdowns whole bunch issues caused lockdowns. help cause minimize people's pain saying things like ""why make fuss it"", ""people paranoid"", etc.  constitution guarantees freedom movement, making lock unlawful. limit public events violate part constitution. Swedes looking sympathy. overwhelming majority people think they're fine feel sorry countries. Crazy, yes, life pretty normal Sweden virus still distant enemy.

I kept saying sooner later wake-up call numbers get bad enough. However, happen back spring, even Sweden among worst numbers world, started doubt ever happen. Swedes seem happy current strategy situation. Big Gretch Energy cross reaction come from, never coronavirus infection? redditeurs said need vaccine :( point many people aware of.

My friend, lives Japan works pharmaceutical industry there, keeps talking lack testing cause low number confirmed covid cases. surely virus wide spread Europe, would news lack hospital beds etc. Japanese must done something right keep number serious cases low enough thay hospitals cope. Sounds like got baptism fire.

Unless quit, nothing ever challenge confidence nursing situation, ever again.

Most us proud doctors nurses, front-lines, every day pandemic.

There studies. almost year. would expect regarding long term immunity particular virus? Claims three months immunity definitely hold water though, based studies like happens, got rate 0.01%. Reinfection within months people generally? baseless, baseless claim.

You've failed address point regarding antibodies. Stop skirting.

That's concern. kids would unlikely get sick now, I'm worried unknowns potential future complications. we're laying low we're able get vaccinated. can't. constitutional authority so. also see categories. Way many fat, middle aged diabetics thinking someone else high risk category. Studies showing online kids catching higher rates, teachers. Masks work, many think casual settings. Masks. Closing bars. Reducing capacity indoor events. Modified school schedules. Encouragement social distancing. sorts things nothing full lockdown. Well i'm sure ur older population somewhat sheltering would get plane sick pandemic???

Well, imagine people lie symptoms get plane anyway want stranded wherever were. can't imagine people would willing shell money stay hotel quarantine somewhere tested positive away home, would much rather try sneak way back it, get tested back. Something effect. rookie numbers, etc.

It's even helping make jokes anymore. Lmao yEr ReSeArCh Bro, I'll 28 years 3 months then, lol.

Look Iowa, science denying governor relented made mask mandate sees hospital system collapsing there. problem you‚Äôve already conditioned population ignore science, won‚Äôt listen later. tell people take boats lake, husband called marina boat put said no, said deserved different treatment wife governor? big pharma gonna charge arm leg US? Sad. local staple. 
Christmas cancelled. doctor dumb take *punches sack True. another famous leader say Bleach could kill virus too? ;-) Also, majority killed 9/11 wealthy whites perpetrators poor brown people.

Covid disproportionately killing Blacks, Latinos, Native Americans poor whites government care about. forget oldsters taking nursing home beds. problem Japan's government refusing anything virus, even test it.

So, entire burden staying home, taking risks, facing harms left Japanese people. end sight. become positive fired job probably. ...who think manufacturing vaccine?

It's stretch imagination realize tourism heavily line well expected money rolling Olympics. one things everyone knows say. couple doctors scientists said numbers 50-100x what's reported, stories kind thing that, get reported all, get reported never again. 


Here's something talks briefly: Internalized misogyny women display misogyny. Listerine enemas long Covid-19 came out. Mark words. . . Sometime early January, Trump still office, virus hit 1 million new cases day, hospitals overrun, nation grind halt. states forced turn international aid organizations nations help.

It coming. Angel!


...of death ""Conservative"" women excellent track record either. alive remember months dude even, like Dr Thunder Dr Pibb Maybe we're lucky, pandemic wipe species out.  Gabapentin worst medication ever took. withdrawals 6 months, took 2 years finally feel like again. hope so. [JUST HOOK  -	New cases: 148,532

I‚Äôm saying you‚Äôre wrong bad, problem people constantly shouting others trust science listen experts, harass people obeying every arbitrary nonsensical measure put covid, like nahhh, vaccine me. actually read something this, I'll see find link, author advised something along lines saying ""do mind put space us"" instead "" give space"". Emphasizing ""Us"" vs ""give me"" supposedly makes neutral Pretty sure want many people fly possible - ‚Äúsane people‚Äù. people wore masks socially distanced could saved economy. many ""my freedumb"" people ruining rest us usual. throw kids together school. Makes sense all. People really want free babysitters. Meanwhile: *state reps drawing impeachment articles Whitmer* anyone explain California shutdown numbers/decisions?

There's gotta immunity lasts time. mean studies I'm seeing think atleast 12 weeks studies showing 7 months. hope there's immunity think. atleast get bad. needs around 70-80% seems highly unlikely US Asking people abstain seeing friends year family may beneficial end

All things brought nowhere near difficult this, additionally simply stated people avoid leaving houses ""wherever possible."" 

I nowhere stated people remain isolated friends family year. pretty interesting people defensive points large easy take one's stride. I've seen surveys Pew basically showing much. /CV: Eradicate death!  Whoopsie think poor article. That‚Äôs correct, seeing now. definitely expands use. Dr Fauci saying today Pfizer/Biontech vaccine distributed hospitals long term care facilities hundreds dosages could administered days, Moderna would go family practitioners. definitely see Republican governor intentionally delaying shipments urban blue neighborhoods politics. Exactly. different would knew strength ten men. fear physical retaliation. careful every action made break environment around build people far weaker. would necessity think different way. Basically today complete guess, semi-realistic tentative ballpark CEO saying likely June, actually optimistic timeline experts vaccine likely approved December, there's still mass production distribution. counting fact first doses reserved essential personnel, vulnerable populations, pretty unlikely Pfizer front-runners, along vaccines Astra-zeneca one Oxford, here's nice tracker New York thing widely available things better open fuck up. point it‚Äôs personal choice put risk. opening point shouldn‚Äôt percent population actually vaccinated option available population hold breath vaccine timelines tbh. high pressure concentrated pray less pressure washer. like powerful spray setting hose. done pat dry squares TP, using much less bidet.

Let's think opposite scenario help rationalize people love bidets: got poop arm face, would get bit paper wipe away happy that? would prefer wash water, pat skin dry? understanding think vaccine, told received placebo. may told placebo possible, sure (I think doctors even know administering placebo). words, everyone thinks get vaccine.

If thought vaccine, would lot less careful week following 2nd jab. that's me. Last heard, surveys showed people US likely take Europeans.

Antivaxers problem, logistics will. need. NIH=Feds=Trump

Wrong. Reddit full weird ‚Äúscience-based‚Äùauthoritarians sadly. Reddit skews young - personal risks minuscule. Great societal risks yes, personally 23 year old no. That‚Äôs probably why. wish would pop everytime someone posts hospital ""getting money patients died Covid""  1337 ppl use w00t Turns out, deadly viruses don‚Äôt really care believe them. They‚Äôll go ahead kill anyway. many others really weird anxiety?

I know anxiety prescriptions roof ever since pandemic me, get random anxious fear panic throughout day apparent reason times.

While nervous pandemic, I'm nervous back March. can't tell anxiety associated virus not.

Anyone else issue? sucks. turkey dinner lots people, hardly ever see! could important? ??? They‚Äôre testing hotspots country/world still neuralgia 7 years later. 31 got it. Every time try get wear mask like ""Prove works!"" send data say fake fine random website says masks useless. call stupid liberal. Imagine country like China owned, various assets, media. Like Reddit. 

Could affect sway American opinion subject matter?  Isolation evolutionarily engineered distressing. Solitary humans didn‚Äôt survive, took whole pack working together. Asking people abstain seeing friends year family may beneficial end‚Äî I‚Äôm willing entertain argument. don‚Äôt act like it‚Äôs small thing ask, easy, normal, isn‚Äôt. Me, too. I'd hate reason someone ended dead, ventilator, long-term disabled anything. opposite. Last year's hurt week, year day two.  Well done sources! show excellent masks vents effective. updote

They seem tests new, hand-made-with-vent masks see around though. Hilariously enough neither know (and sake joke, know) actually state run socialized medicine (ie free vaccinations) live? That's sure. Hillary Clinton there? Dad making executive orders. de Moderna vaccine ~95 so. Right Biden becomes president OH HUMANITY!

In govt renewed scrutiny contracts help combat virus (for PPE, tracking spread, building track trace system, etc) worth billions handed mates without formal tender process.

Just time book flight Olympics! Survey finds 38% participants *willing admit* spend Thanksgiving family friends. virus literally spreading control right now?  Abstract: 

Extrapulmonary manifestations severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection widely recognized important clinical knowledge, association SARS-CoV-2 respiratory muscles studied. surprising, respiratory muscles drive alveolar ventilation weakness results acute respiratory failure. critically ill patients undergoing ventilation, respiratory muscle weakness prolongs mechanical ventilation increases aim study investigate association severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) respiratory muscles critically ill patients compare findings obtained non-COVID-19 critically ill patients. know book club disadvantaged children? sister kids amazing. clarify, herd immunity on/off switch, rather gradient. Also, level immunity required natural spread likely less level required vaccine, natural spread heterogenous whereas vaccination homogenous. Natural immunity effective largest spreaders also likely get infected first (those meet people).

With said, letting virus run wild attempt achieve natural immunity stupid idea, would result way many deaths.

In Sweden's case, herd immunity spread never strategy. Different strategies outcomes discussed officials scientists, herd immunity one them. level immunity society discussed (and honestly mathematical models flawed case). actually letting virus run wild.

Recommendations restrictions enacted limit spread, pretty much every country. main difference recommendations mostly voluntary, variety reasons (such relatively high compliance anyway constitutional limitations).

The idea Sweden letting virus run wild dangerous, lead people pointing us example anything (or reversely, strict lockdowns necessary) - completely disregarding fact Sweden actually several policies place limit spread. gonna clear Hawaii Alaska send vulnerable people there? Or... what's plan, considering everyone interconnected vulnerable populations coworkers, neighbors, family. 

I NEVER read actual plan vague notion would work. ""Let healthy people get sick unhealthy"" pure barstool theorizing. virus know who.

Also: FL actually post tweet bragging 7.5% positivity rate? Bro, even test? Rescheduling! seems like pervasive mentality among many US. selfish uncompassionate way living. dentist said gargle salt dissolved water daily top regular brushing teeth would sufficient. kinda tell sometimes placebo presence absence common side effects That's really bad generalization. Plenty people working providing solution working home. power brainwashing impressive. many states actually enforce mandates? Texas instance, widely reported mask mandates enforced except big cities. brutally honest, yes. know person make assumption, know could great guy, looking one action isolation: Yes, sounds like asshole would probably do. people stupid enough plan big Thanksgiving dinners, they‚Äôre gonna settle small funerals! Germany reading article still unclear timeline this. natural phenomena. linear plan narrative. Everyone free proppar new solutions. Rough way start new life together, knowing likely killed couple friends. covid levels time high right now. wanted take infection rates next level, would mix populations different regions get together groups extended periods time.

...oh wait... fuck. come plan small funerals going work 40 hours week despite work small indoor space full people? boss. Also claims virus would ""over"" Nov election ended. willful ignorance infuriating.  *affect Folks like cases Missouri elsewhere surging. Go ahead pat back bud, apparently pretty get virus. 

I dont particularly like them, understand ever want get wear damn thing. dont look tough point wearing it, stupid. Stay safe seems like lot Western European countries taking similar measures closing places leisure, schools shops.

I feel still early really see measures making difference. We're past 2 weeks November, need wait another week really see difference figures, difference. I'm skeptical, especially since schools still open. ???

Don't change context comment got caught skimming. think virus already mouth mouthwash save you. 

It could help infected people spreading though need get herd immunity get back normal. go back normal there's infection disease / practically disease. Anyway I'm doubftul much people refuse get vaccine see excluded normal life Stupid. reading decision later results proven.  Dude capitalist countries Asia communist. It‚Äôs possible damage caused virus immune reaction cause long-term damage recognize, shingles-like reactivation COVID-19.

Why? biology virus.

Chickenpox, herpes, HIV never fully cleared body insert pieces DNA chromosomes re-emerge active viral infection immune system ever loses ability keep check stop taking anti-HIV drugs. 

But order insert DNA human chromosome able make DNA. Chickenpox herpes able made DNA, HIV RNA virus able enzyme called reverse transcriptase convert RNA DNA (for remember biology, enzyme gets name transcription common process organisms converts DNA RNA).

But know looking COVID-19‚Äôs sequence made RNA contain enzyme like reverse transcriptase. cannot hide inside chromosomes decades recover immune system eventually fully clear virus body.  lose medical license. know field, totally would ethical violations dealing misleading regarding serious health issue. Dr. Acula right. really ought show respect people's imaginary boogeymen. yet mayor reject group wants protest. can't gather groups inside out, unless protesting something, free all. This.    /r/thathappened yet peer-reviewed

So really news.

Also - suggesting use mouthwash every time get new saliva mouth? Maybe that's reasonable, idk. tRiEd cUtTiNg tAxEs yEt??? I‚Äôm starting pitch idea Thanksgiving/Christmas holiday celebration July! makes idea canceling less bad. pathetic comment. Go back hole crawled of, troll. I'll take alternative lots dead people followed bankruptcies March. saying is...I inject mouthwash? ‚ÄúThe Cardiff University report, entitled Virucidal Efficacy Oral Rinse Components SARS-CoV-2 Vitro, also yet peer reviewed.‚Äù

Again, hold on.  honestly see bars restaurants reopening December. even rate reach 50/100k people, reopening relaxing restrictions cause cases shoot again? Unfortunately people going change ways/thoughts till effects them. people learn hard way. sucks like negativity impacts don‚Äôt. islands much easier time controlling borders.

Germany borders 9 different countries. perhaps there's bit sass though, trying compelled people wear masks pointing they'd stupid otherwise. Lol. submission contains domain hardbanned reddit cannot approved, usually due major violations [site-wide rules](/rules).

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Pfizer/German government also arranged logistic provider store (freezers) distribute (dry ice) vaccin? Dr. Slice. Anyone else old enough remember that? emphasis personal rights freedoms ""better safe sorry"". different kind cautious. really built pandemics, called pandemic law really translates Infection Control Act. 

What really need pandemic ""state emergency""-law allows government act quickly limit personal rights freedoms. generic ""state emergency""-law, instead European country specific ""war law"" applicable war. ‚ÄúThe report ‚Äì Virucidal Efficacy Oral Rinse Components SARS-CoV-2 Vitro ‚Äì yet peer reviewed supports another study published last week found CPC-based mouthwashes effective reducing Covid‚Äôs viral load.‚Äù

Here ya go. Don‚Äôt go panic buying mouthwash now. It‚Äôs looking good hold on. Western Civilisation end saving rest world research efforts charity poorer countries

Pros Cons cultures People rarely learn mistakes. Walmart doesn‚Äôt mandate masks staff? work Sam‚Äôs club can‚Äôt even pull mine take drink water. certain store isn‚Äôt making employees wear masks please let know cause that‚Äôs ridiculous. Literally ""Gamers Rise Up"" meme? get here? It‚Äôs time hunker down. ""This year"" Seriously please let know store at. could probably actually action taken would like report Stupid stupid does. link behind paywall.  Wait I‚Äôm confused works since Moderna for-profit company. donated $1 million Vanderbilt Medical Center, helped developed vaccine, Moderna gets profits? In-vitro. 

All knowledge worth knowing mouthwash kills viruses in-vitro magic bullet C19 thought standard measure. Part NZ level 4/3 lockdown dogs could walked leashed allowed lead going walk. Dogs can't transmit virus surprised fur didn't. 

We cordoned dog parks, play grounds parks situation simple touch cause leave traces covid19.

Looking back strict. wild reminisce back March April moving unknown. want political careful every news coming China matter whether good bad news. 

Also remember size China, need vaccinate one billion people, sure millions people waiting get shots Let's back up. accept viruses cause neurological damage? understand ""novel"" means context? knows comes next.

Yeah huge surge bankruptcies january. unfortunately lot ethnicity. 

A conversation many people ready yet.  Zoom it. Taiwan, New Zealand: Allow us introduce Thank clarifying me! educated way, too! Oh no, people going drink it, they? Proposed making masks mandatory schools? mandatory now? Wow that's unexpected already long term issues COVID flu have: organ damage, brain damage, blood clotting, etc. know long go yet.  stock pile prednisone 100 nebulizer doses reason. I've 2 years grandma sister eosinophilic asthma.  Yeah that, months they‚Äôll still saying we‚Äôve never tried MNRA-based vaccine yet, unaligned nucleotide sneak cells day drinking justification became legit!  difference emergency laws allowed politicians ""run over"" experts. not. know school closings younger children really key coming hammer early form wide sweeping emergency laws probably is. wait absolutely necessary gradual wait pandemic usually late. EAT FOOD GIVE THANKS DAY YEAR! tool. somehow, still people saying tests = cases. half tests coming back positive, can‚Äôt tell increase cases there‚Äôs tests done. It‚Äôs amazing people able ignore what‚Äôs front them. 9 months later....ummmm.....thanks  ride bike masks commute. 25 minute trip average speed according computer 16.5 mph fast honestly heavy bike bag carbon racing bike. thicker masks 100% impede ability breathe I'm pushing hard extended period time. might factor getting wet might different masks tested study hard time accepting results general statement first hand experience directly contradicts findings.

I've learned use certain masks bike try sprint long big deal I'm saying can't active mask on. easily adapt mask. definitely affect hitting pace breathing hard. Well, think 40% population disagrees. Trust way innovate. succeed USSR kill something like five million citizens use another 10 million cannon fodder nazis. used blood money succeed. Innovation driven desire success sense altruism. mean place governor wants COVID-infected health care workers keep working? tried everything, could happened!?

I used live Manitoba, visited Dakotas frequently. trying best, empathy best wishes. comments warranted removal political isn‚Äôt banning offense unless would continue posting bunch political comments. Even would short ban. much easier solution would simply move away sub. Crazy think span one year, global pandemic started infected almost 56 million people far nearly 1.35 million dead it. bad use inmates stuff.

If normal people would able interviews get insight bad things there.

But prisoners working it, imagine taken right back prison afterwards opportunity share experiences. bad! dont think realistically going study every individual measure early. personally would rather full lockdown mixed per state, peacemeal actions Im supporting actions taken point. Nice. Sure could use it. Deaths still flat. Hospitals overrun. without locking feel like dialysis unit less exposure risk wedding. Real concern would dialysis receiver catching covid spreading across dialysis unit...

Edit: don‚Äôt think comment intended way, nothing wrong dialysis patients enjoying full spectrum lives participating important events. (Pandemic aside). Don‚Äôt stigmatize chronic illness further. What‚Äôs point months away vaccines? Exactly work require go work. Look North Dakota. Highest mortality rate world. South Dakota highest positivity rate country. knew antimask stance would help election

More specifically knew supported masks Donald Trump would target reelection. Trump unlikely powerful, tiny bit courage conviction sane. dislike county music. adore Dolly. charged manslaughter then? People defiantly died actions. CDC 1/20/21 going leak like spigot, going erupt like waterfall. positive rate considered terrible 

So would say 56%?   May be. getting hopes happens. Hope though, need this. Yes, access disposable surgical masks, also better cloth masks.  recently read story, redit!?
In someone suggested paying people 1k take 
Sounds good nothing families dead. Maybe $350k per death go them. :( believe case A) good luck getting local police actually enforce it. restrictions, mandates, fines etc. useless enforcement unfortunate reality.

B) sounds good theory highly unethical way convincing practicing medical professional deny treatment. I'm sure physicians see idiots everyday, example choose wear seatbelt get accident, going deny medical care Minneapolis filling up. ICU's 90% full. anything actually goes I'm saying, please present it. want squabble layman terms get pedantic, accept actual argument cause trouble. lit fuse doesn‚Äôt cause much damage reaches dynamite. 

People weren‚Äôt expecting virus, wasn‚Äôt anyone‚Äôs radar, isn‚Äôt *especially* deadly everyone gets it. might originated meat stalls China like lot people think, it‚Äôs also possible started elsewhere blew reached critical population density. reason antique Rome war-time leadership separate peace leadership. massive conflict interest, making unpopular decisions. Really valuing lives would 2-month complete lockdown, politican would risk re-elected. power money. know acronyms World Warcraft, Phastasy Star Online 2 &amp; Runescape political - that's new.... many go bar midnight drink go home. stay last call, maybe go someone's house drink more. definitely thinking masks hand washing. Nah, straight Nancy Pelosi know it. worldwide effort create vaccine, weird would 10 months. vaccines take longer urgent global effort huge scale availability resources.

They've done trials proved far effectiveness short term safety. course can't know long term effects vaccine (or disease) that's around year, ensure ingredients known harmful, based vaccines around long term major side effects. wrong two levels. fact many restrictions recommendations limit spread (well, lockdown, far letting run wild either), things fine.

Edit: mention Sweden's measures rely heavily public healthcare, state-backed sick leave parts social security net funded high haxes. state basically pays people stay home. Illinois leading pack couple weeks now.  depends state. Texas one prisoners forced Except never even happened even NYC. true, willing give Trump full credit least it, even though agree pretty much nothing else. don‚Äôt remember specifically, something wearing masks 2022 craziness would honestly satisfied states could close borders other. responsible states get dragged states nothing. natural infection without closing borders/state lines. places high levels seroprevalence see lower community spread may useful targeting certain areas heavily vaccine rollout. I'm convinced literal angel seriously bless woman fine people sides. thing NWT FDA one reviewing data. Brute forcing way pandemic solution. horrible one kill alot people. Great coffin makers though. also true. I‚Äôm pointing average person would struggle Scientific American version science reporting. Same, longer October. considering potential connections immune memory protective immunity, it
is key consider available epidemiological data. Individual case reports demonstrate that
reinfections SARS-CoV-2 occurring. currently lacking epidemiological
framework quantifying rare common reinfection events are. Thus, interpretations current events constrained. high degree heterogeneity magnitude adaptive immune responses novel coronavirus. heterogeneity observed study carried immune memory phase SARS-CoV-2. result immune response heterogeneity, observed cohort here, may expected least fraction SARSCoV-2-infected population particularly low immune memory would susceptible re-infection relatively quickly Well technically he's federal-level politician (e.g. access resources Senators) IMO biggest threat right now. I'm also Mass largely gov asked us. Even west 495,which considered Mass's version hick country(which bullshit). fact summer hundred cases day.

The gov asked us stay home take precautions. did. gov fuck itself. create feasible track trace, expand covid medical facilities. plan economic relief people affected closures, fucking anything. even come measures schools summer figure out. utterly failed us.

And Baker balls talk us like children. blame us resurgence everyone knew gonna take place weather turned. done alleviate problems. damn thing. Fuck horse rode on. Thanks assholes threatening family think risk fairly low first vaccines rolled out, since target single Covid protein, spike. developers could shot higher efficacy longer lasting effects targeting two proteins, would increased possible side effects.    comment say? many died? Can‚Äôt many it‚Äôs even title. like ""it'll fine, first potential pandemic we've dealt with. CDC pretty good plan.""

Wish I'd right. back gonna hurt getting 6 extra shots carry average.. honesty, think CDC push get kids back school, much influence.
Local government along parents, want back in. 
I think good idea then, think good idea 
Obviously CDC operation CYA u/PAKVAEDI legally can‚Äôt give less care. That‚Äôs works. That‚Äôs works. comments thread reason enough? friends conservatives arms Philly PA restrictions. head ‚Äúyou aren‚Äôt going follow anyway care‚Äù fact would say one best react early on.

And Ohio cases PA one earliest states see huge numbers. Thank work commitment. might need help colleagues appreciate efforts. Seriously. Best luck getting vaccine ASAP. Hope give money considering circumstances. expect federal-level politicians die coronavirus point.

It seems like celebrities ok well. blonde Jesus prophesied  u/PAKVAEDI 
So think us nurses take care even critically ill patients already do? Technically CAN, it‚Äôs killing us. Regular units fully staffed. Nurses quitting running hills. don‚Äôt get support extra $ support staff. We‚Äôre tired can‚Äôt keep up. words, nobody matters human race hates Dolly Parton. For-Profit Gulags? fines enforced time, methinks. Barley House Cleveland got fined $9k violation last weekend, new rules. exciting week vaccines immunity. know winter suck soon we'll able crawl ways one worst experiences lives (yet). Mutated != Weaker|Stronger different. particular virus seem pressure become less deadly since easily spreads asymptomatic stage still deadly. Honestly, considering nonchalantly pandemic handled, little panic might bad thing really. Everytime something happens there's chorus voices chiming trying minimize impact event, resulted people taking shit seriously. 

I'd rather see people freaked overreacting wearing hazmat suits throngs mouth breathers wearing masks right now. seems like lot older politicians getting Covid coming ok.

Did Trump's crew end dying? btw peantubutter oreos freakin best. hate kroger doesnt carry around me, travel Mart That's rough, really hope get great job soon. someone indicated previously posted, don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs necessary resubmit. However, don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs accurate call article Independent ‚Äúsocial media post‚Äù. That‚Äôs inappropriate  fair, Operation Warp Speed provided funding quick R&amp;D, manufacturing distribution effective vaccine, funding otherwise may available. say anything re-infections. Also mathematically 17% people already fully recovered virus coming back new infection virus, would indicate covid gives absolutely immunity getting covid makes even *more* susceptible getting virus . 17% positivity rate infections population people recovered virus, would mean likely get infected virus already getting infected virus first place. would mean positivity rate infection 3x higher people already recovered person never virus prior. clearly isn‚Äôt case it‚Äôs important back assertions actual sources going make claim like that. Gather energy, y‚Äôall! Look information vaccines comes out. basis vaccines work. train body fight virus. might take time get long term data.  Likely far more. Wisconsin worse New York beginning. numbers bad Manaus Brazil was.

Wisconsin track become first US region see dramatic slowdown covid due partial herd immunity. compliment, something proud of.

Wisconsin, state 5.8 million. seen 335,000 documented cases. Research varies consensus testing, particularly state large portions population appear ambivalent disease, misses true number cases multiples.

Assuming Wisconsin 6x many cases they've tested, that's around 2 million total almost 35% state population. Covid presumed R0 around 2.5. suggests R0 get 1 60% population immune resistant.

60% 5.8M around 3.5M. average 6500 new cases per day (which Wisconsin averaging last couple weeks, x6 around 40,000. Wisconsin already seen 2M infected, 40,000 new cases day, hit 60% infected 37 days now.

Given recovery lags 30 days behind, Wisconsin expect see distinct turn cases January comes end far deaths have. 

Brute forcing way pandemic solution. increase Social Score? wife due 3 weeks second, decided long ago home birth horrible experience hospital. I'm glad we'll home one, thinking going near hospital gives anxiety right now. people buying blaming fellow citizens.

Stopped reading there. obviously living another planet me. Oh yeah, definitely majority. Well, least hope so. Immunity lasts months tho. literally existence works. Strictly true. recently published guidelines effectively use masks settings like nursing homes. use masks public settings recommended FHM pushing fundamental changes society get rid crowding public transportation similar situations. recommend masks situations effort would wasted reason. might think sounds strange work public health idea would big implications infectious diseases general.

A personal observation working decade hotel: large number humanity, maybe 20% low key neurological problem, giving difficulty focusing, concentrating, dealing problems think.

It's people instance cannot find elevator even though right front them, show 2 night two children they're travelling children think ""where sleep"" middle night, people know e-mail adress on.

Always thought people would big fraction covid patients, unable understand follow guidelines, even best served following it. 

I've boot people rainy night, able follow rules they'd told multiple times, also told would suck get booted rain would best comply. people can't it. simply can't remember much 5 minutes explained understand masks on.

So guess lot covid patients group people maybe low key ADHD whatever wrong them. 

And low key mental problems overrepresented covid patients.

I guess ADHD people would find hard remember social distance months instance. 

I'm seing people walk into/through crowds strangers, order go look random flower pot stuff like that. thinking keep pandemic, likely catch it.  Long covid isn‚Äôt made up, pretend majority people get covid long term symptoms is. Hah hospital sometimes runs zero beds remaining even without Covid. means need discharge less sick patients make room sometimes. Could hit area freed beds Covid patients canceling elective surgeries.   use every night. work warehouse people hardly wear masks we've outbreaks. could havent gotten yet symptoms. sickness situation millions Americans contracting COVID, hundreds thousands dying it, deny severity chose alter lifestyle habits order protect fellow man.

I've seen various Japanese scientific papers coming explanations why. predominant theory everyone Japan immune cross-reactivity Japanese people have. quite hard believe.

The alternative theory contained normal mask wearing isolation practices summer - essentially US would able started basic mask wearing February. theory, they're going big, big trouble since population-level immunity testing.

Hey dude, I'm calling bets February. saying vaccine approval around Spring, expect lot throw Mardi Gras party fuck it, anyways. get flexible. I'm Saints fan, I'm stranger topic. certainly case. person immunological memory would detectable levels IgG memory B cells.

That appears wrong. true, would mean literally every person without detectable levels IgG memory B cells would functional immune system. [There also IgM memory B cells retain immune think trying point markers active immune response also representing immune memory, two completely different things. Immune memory retained even long given immune response run technology certainly many years now. 

No, manner described. B cells tend circulating we'd find certain percentage among PBMCs specific virus person retained memory.

Not memory B cells circulate. someone detectable levels memory B cells, would call immunocompromised? not, specific virus

How identify cells specific particular virus? Antibodies specific. would specific counter remain blood forever, long infection passed? makes sense. would mean human blood would become massive traffic jam pathogen countermeasures aged fought one infection another. Obviously happen. countermeasures disappear time longer reason believe SARS-CoV-2 acts like coronavirus

Since coronavirus, every reason believe acts similarly coronaviruses. also necessarily retain immunological memory

I reject assertion. Show proof coronavirus somehow immune human immunological memory. tell qualification ""don't necessarily"" none, instead trying ploy shift burden me. reject well.

The default case viruses antibodies produced, immune memory retained. concept immunity vaccination would exist otherwise. Again, assertion immunological memory work COVID, would mean every vaccine would fail, since vaccines rely creation immunological memory provide short lived protective immunity allowing homologous reinfection.

Again, prove it. understanding immune memory - rule - long lasting, life. reason see ""re-infection"" daily life truly re-infection, flu, new infection new different mutated strain prior immunity provide protection, person remains immune prior strain. authors also agree interpretation addressed conclusion paper. So, there's also that...

I disagree. study's conclusion points towards immunity decades, claim large number people immunity short time. memory B cells specific spike RBD detected almost COVID-19 cases, apparent half-life 5+ months post-infection. B cell memory infections observed long-lived, including 60+ years smallpox vaccination (58), 90+ years infection influenza (59), another respiratory virus like SARS-CoV-2. memory cell half-lives observed 6+ months PSO cohort (~166-271d CD8+ ~96-174d CD4+ cells) comparable 123d t1/2 observed memory CD8+ cells soon yellow fever immunization (55). Notably, durability fraction yellow fever virus-specific memory CD8+ cells possessed estimated t1/2 485d deuterium labeling (55). Using different approaches, long-term durability memory CD4+ cells smallpox, period many years, estimated t1/2 ~10 years (58, 60), also consistent recent detection SARS-CoV cells 17 years initial infection (61). data suggest cell memory might reach stable plateau, slower decay phase, later first 6 months post-infection.

Then study goes directly contradict claim detectable levels IgG memory B immune memory source long-term protective immunity, direct conclusions protective immunity cannot made basis quantifying SARS-CoV-2 circulating antibodies, memory B cells, CD8+ cells, CD4+ cells, mechanisms protective immunity SARS-CoV-2 COVID-19 defined humans. **circulating memory assessed here**; possible local URT immune memory minimal, moderate, large component immune memory primary infection SARS-CoV-2. remains determined. 

So that's refuted there, point difficulty identifying precise immune memory backed science. post text.

Colorado I'm glad piece raised issue car wrecks: lot road trips, lot wrecks, Thanksgiving. ""no beds"" mean ""no beds covid patients;"" means **no beds anyone**.""

Soon we're gonna start seeing covid hospitalizations Halloween parties. Then, Thanksgiving Black Friday. Then, Christmas New Year's Eve. 

I feel anyone works patient care patient contact role next months. vaccinated matter else Black (Death) Friday.

*""Bring yer dead!!""* everyone 80. guess... Count in, happy cake day !! Alcohol chemical..... ""Stop dumb"" Employees might sick. Iv seen coworkers cough food before. think mean 180 children. We've got huge stack books organization, two year old points picture says ""dolly parton!"" since face back cover them. Yes. used Covid funds buy tourism ads. ‚ÄúWhy sacrifice 330 million Americans me?‚Äù - 330 million Americans 82 year old boss basically bragging he‚Äôs going NJ‚Äôs 10 person indoor limit, thanksgiving gathering 20 people. big family big house says governor won‚Äôt stop traditional dinner. Iant weird mods took away sort contriversial? Moderna BioNTech first? Also, respect her. don‚Äôt seem get they‚Äôre people planet. swamp hospitals people non-COVID needs (heart attacks, car accidents, etc.) may get less care required conditions. criticise countries claim immunity fall, huge waves....Then cant get angry people say going herd immunity This, hardest part overcome increased anxiety. already panic disorder mask raises anxiety there. I'm struggling breathe mask, panic attack something face gives me.

That said, still manage find way wear mine. work. 13 hours day.

It's challenging, took good four weeks get used it/ find coping mechanism it, doable hate excuses hear people. agree know, gates giving charity mass amounts 20 years. donated 40 billion, think? 

Really seems like change heart helping others game since beginning. 

Which totally separate bill's sometimes aggressive questionable business dealings. DOLLY Nobel Prize Recipient! cannot explain without confusing good article.

America unique comparisons least stretch. else even could answer? open everything giant COVID parties achieve 100% infection herd immunity?

Besides that, concern vaccines early indications multiple EXTREMELY effective ones coming? I'd see worry vaccines 30-50% effective, we're looking multiple 90+% effective ones, that's literally best case scenario.

The ones miffed probably deranged anti-vaxxers like get see real time incredible modern medicine achieves effective vaccine something. idiots generally young understand things like smallpox polio could ravage populations vaccines. would need two! One wrist! Genius!!!! Bandaid holding nose portion seen. People dying cancer haven‚Äôt diagnosed yet healthcare system overloaded victims anti-masker disease vectors. honest answer I‚Äôve seen morons wear mask, somehow ‚ÄúLibs win‚Äù they‚Äôre bowing ‚ÄúLibs‚Äù. current administration politicized masks, get. true. Sedgwick County initially opted Wichita Mayor City Council voted enact one right county voted down. mandate city one Sedgwick County enacted County Health Officer.  Beginning what? antibiotics?

Are serious troll? I'm sorry caring health general public actually empathy others comes across ""tyrannical"". Maybe go /r/Conservative horrible viewpoint praised, echo chamber like you. Covid cemented fact I‚Äôm going everything move country. don‚Äôt want listen selfish wackos anymore.  Fry bacon, shallots, garlic mixed mushrooms. Stir flour whisk milk. Mix parmesan cooked green beans, add pan top crappy french fried onions bake amazing. Still improvement obese orange blob we're going right direction front. Went Houston couple weekends ago, expecting bars strict masks nope. Walked several packed out, masks all. Wild af lol terrible athlete. wear mask work entire time issues. I've also seen great athletes like Mike Trout thing. people excuse everyone falls Mike Trout scale athletic ability. They're adults capable paying attention research. sympathy bad decision making evidence facts available. Unlike HCQ, actually shown something. isn‚Äôt focus this???? bothered enough find new doctors. that, great. Plus, live/work alone (been working remote since March) limit going public (and always mask up). read it, tells Swedish gdp growth higher nz‚Äôs. Thanks!  must never paid bills, nevermind started business, say saying.

No, western countries people need work otherwise rent food pay itself. might starve death Somalia, catastrophically horrible life.

It absurd even explain someone. level education sank low? co-worker thinks covid liberal conspiracy Trump. grandfather died covid says people really dying covid doctors nurses ""padding numbers"" get money government. 


The government giving us money. They're giving themselves. Thank much!!   Yeah, people understand yelling sky falling, isn't, cause people think fine venture outside.

We need take pandemic seriously, nowhere near level literally need personal bomb shelters. that's kind world today, people overreacting someone else's overreaction others overreactions.

Now people think there's two sides: ""Don't see interact anyone someone probably die"", ""This virus hurt anyone, there's need masks precautions"".

As usual, best course probably somewhere middle. keep doing. signs point virus causing serious chronic health problems even immediate symptoms might seem pretty mild. Even vaccine becomes widely available next summer, disease killing people *decades* secondary cardiovascular pulmonary complications. hope country manages catch rest world regarding universal healthcare, definitely going need it. I‚Äôve said before, think things start getting back normal end Spring. We‚Äôll likely still need wear masks rest year. doubt we‚Äôll really need social distance. Italy 500 deaths per day right now. US would amount 2750 deaths.

Right, Italy one first nations hit hard made wrong call. Instead instituting widespread testing/isolation/tracing protocols like South Korea, quarantined whole communities others, creating vast reservoirs disease that, restrictions lifted, continued UK 200, France 500. So, deaths, right US better

By deaths per capita. US leads deaths world-wide, important US gotten much better hold disease coastal cities. midwest spreading states monthly per capita death rate growing horrifyingly fast, much much faster accounting US hit harder nation

When look data, US growth rate quickly dwarfing everyone national strategy compared nations aggressive approach like Germany, we're dire straights! We're getting hit hard we're addressing issue.

Every nation suffering like US problem: act early universally. That's key issue epidemic. exponential growth, can't anything effective limiting initial growth short universal immunity (e.g. vaccination). neither science circumstantial evidence matters you.

If believe mass media articles, tell want believe, truly part problem. [archive link anyone trouble accessing article patience sympathy sheep anymore. committed believing something hoax even *literally* killing you, fucking moron. 

These people believing hoax likely infected others careful (or vulnerable them, like children coworkers people served Walmart went shopping at) even symptoms ‚Äúprobably cold lung cancer‚Äù didn‚Äôt give fuck infecting others. fine rushed protocols since coming Trump's people last four years proven don‚Äôt care hideous President looks. Remove ""New"" state's name guarantee come excess mortality high, looking whether higher looking year-on-year.

As brutal know sounds, especially people want see emotional response medical crisis, numbers short period something Swedish authorities see alarming equals across year.

It stated already couple months ago, cold terms, high numbers deaths likely caused mild flu season 2019-2020. led people surviving expected, turn led higher number vulnerable people catching COVID dying it.

Does make deaths less sad? course not. mean simply accept many people died? course not. point possible explanations. head real jerk. kept making fun Rock Hudson move different room. lmao he's racist.

You deluded chuckle fucks worst. believe might go back WWII. Sweden stayed neutral throughout war. Denmark, Norway Finland not. kind crisis therefor much recent memory us Swedes. think part reasons differences constitutions actions politicians. wanting accept responsibility killing family member

Bit stretch there, no??? never trace flu associated ""murder""...it's mad, mad world...  there‚Äôs certain amount arrogance, there, figure get sick they‚Äôll fine, know they‚Äôll get treatment regardless. 

Obviously don‚Äôt want happen practice, I‚Äôd interested see behaviour would change health system allowed withhold treatment based behaviour. stories covid deniers *still* denying even whole they‚Äôre intubated much infuriating sad. I'm similar position re: work. wear two masks people wearing any. Every day getting harder harder. can‚Äôt better candidates parties start running one. deception all, though. 

Oxygen molecules roughly 0.0005 microns. Carbon dioxide molecules even smaller 0.00033 microns. Even wear N95, filter particles small 0.3 microns, way impairing O2 CO2 exchange molecules far small filtered mask. 

Dyspnea simply feeling shortness breath. always representation lung function, gas exchange within lungs. People dyspnea perfectly normal O2 saturation, DLCO, overall lung function. fact, incredibly common anxiety; lungs work perfectly fine, still feel short breath. Country** Welcome REALITY!!!! Fox News practically centrist news source. Newsmax, OAN, Breitbart, full blown bubble live (and now, die) in. It‚Äôs getting worse every year.  Mmmm, love regulated user contrnt. stupid selfish evil. Almost 3 million people die every year US sorts causes - 3 million, ‚Äúnext year‚Äù. I‚Äôm willing sacrifice year without family guarantees still over, it‚Äôs ludicrous expect to.  idea comment supposed relate comments above. ran major trauma meds. Rollover accident ejection. Family split scene attempt limit numbers patients would take. gave beds left injured patients. ran beds. ran chairs. put sheet floor. 

Imagine floor ER, bloody bruised car accident. family spread different hospitals. mask, surrounding infectious people. can‚Äôt recognize even caring full gear. 

Why anyone would risk this, idea. Why? science pretty clear meeting outdoors masks much safer indoors without masks eating. everyone screeches protests loses credibility clearly know nothing disease transmission prevention. Small business owners believe tax breaks anything facilitates tax breaks. Everything else liberal deep state conspiracy steal hard earned dollars. 


Dentists, psychologists, clinicians/specialists - dumbest selfish motherfuckers ever meet (outside confines profession). wonder could find correlation political views ""dead number"" could predictive metric determining politician would likely implement measures?

There going much data coming pandemic it'll driving psychology/sociology/economics/epidemiology decades come. I've hospital since started due diverticulitis blockages. One best hospitals state one best colon surgeons country. surgeon, gastrologist, pcp, said flu stop watching news. said get life. Even sister n law that's RN stated news along Dr's met. Mind several surgeries 2 blockages since happened normal world, existence same-sex couples right form families acknowledged law mainstream society,as happens Europe, btw. others SJW, bigoted backwards. I'm sorry thst life empty need fill nationalism, hate meddling people's lifes face fact others fringe disgusting outlet. ""uh oh"" Im Turkey guy.  Forget make, stupid town. That's exactly group like. pod 3 households 6 people, neighbors, working home. newest spikes we're closing circle none 6 us pods.


At point basically extended household Keep stretching. literally said Q1. matter interpret August, like babbling one post ago.

Just admit youre wrong. end world. Deserved die then?

In August politicians reassuring worst behind people could gradually reopen shops.

Refrain commenting things understand want lack empathy show Same. I'll probably work bit - sweet sweet double time - since I've always wfh. seen, selective enforcement moral reasons seems go long long aligned far-right ideology. White protestors surround government buildings armed semi-automatic weapons? Quietly stand by. Mandate wear masks promote public health? can't enforce because... well, never clearly articulated way makes sense slightest scrutiny. Minorities protesting police violence? Tear gas, rubber bullets mass arrest.  nice weeks November February. always one ‚Äúperfect day‚Äù March. Besides that... hot humid awful. Death fixes stupid. exactly lose credibility! 

## Abstract

Background: Up-to-date, recognized effective treatment vaccine treatment COVID-19 emphasize urgency around distinctive effective therapies. study aims evaluate anti-parasitic medication efficacy ""Ivermectin"" plus standard care (azithromycin, vitamin C, Zinc, Lactoferrin &amp; Acetylcystein &amp; prophylactic therapeutic anticoagulation D-dimer 1000) treatment mild/moderate severely ill cases COVID 19 infection, well prophylaxis health care and/ household contacts comparison Hydroxychloroquine plus standard treatment.

Subject methods: 600 subjects; 400 symptomatic confirmed COVID-19 patients 200 health care household contacts distributed 6 groups; Group I: 100 patients Mild/Moderate COVID-19 infection received 4-days course Ivermectin plus standard care; Group II: 100 patients mild/moderate COVID-19 infection received hydroxyxholorquine plus standard care; Group III: 100 patients severe COVID-19 infection received Ivermectin plus standard care; Group IV: 100 patients Severe COVID-19 infection received hydroxyxholorquine plus standard care. Routine laboratory investigations RT-PCR reported initiation treatment. Group V stick personal protective equipment (PPE) plus Ivermectin 400mcg / kg repeated one week, Group VI stick PPE groups V&amp;VI followed two weeks.

Results: Patients received ivermectin reported substantial recovery laboratory investigations; significant reduction RT-PCR conversion days. substantial improvement reduction mortality rate Ivermectin treated groups; group (mild/moderate cases), (99%, 0.0%, respectively) group III (severe cases), (94%, 2.0%, respectively) versus hydroxychloroquine plus standard care treated groups; group II (mild/moderate cases), (74% 4%, respectively) group IV (severe cases) (50% 20%, respectively). Ivermectin significantly reduced incidence infection health care household contacts 2% compared 10% non ivermectin group

Conclusion: Addition Ivermectin standard care effective drug treatment COVID-19 patients significant reduction mortality compared Hydroxychloroquine plus standard treatment only. Early use Ivermectin useful controlling COVID 19 infections, prophylaxis improving cytokines storm Ok, answer address original statement elevator scenario?

I'm epidemiology expert. gut statistician wants know 100 kids get vaccine, exposed, many get sick? 5? 50? worse business fails you, something unprecedented. need start showing videos full ICU‚Äôs people ventilators full trucks bodies least change minds know feel bit resentment towards who've spread virus denials really sad they're denying last breath. People suck. coworkers report HR concern exposes company potential liability due company enforcing policy co-workers Yes, next question. point let stupid people cull themselves? know dark cruel, honestly, people wiping might worst thing country. Spring better season Fall too.

Winter behind you, Summer ahead.

Stuff blooming, dying.

No leaves clean up. 

It's bright! dark! called 1918 flu pandemic likely started U.S. Spanish Flu.


Maybe ton disinformation top bottom direction, gullible sheep would taken better precautions dieing.


Instead lame duck calling China Flu, Hoax, claiming would disappear catching becoming super spreader himself.


It's almost people can't process fact dear leader lying them. Yes, family related blood magically filter covid. üôÑ really don¬¥t get get hundreds from. german news every news paper talkling 60 vaccine centers. exactly would vaccine alter DNA?

You might want read articles people dying covid insisting isn‚Äôt real. It‚Äôs real.  I've found best way target conservative anti-maskers turn patriotism. Take old WWII propaganda posters ""sleeps enemy"" kind turn anti-maskers.

Speaking someone wears full blown p95 respirators store (think breaking bad) cloth covering stop outgas valve keep really scaring people. I'm fairly conservative. getting look like badass almost 99% protection ""side effect"" would totally sell hair brained side political spectrum. Yea theres lot air resistance guess actually IMPROVES lung function, could save catch it. week wearing respirator even notice resistance anymore.

I know anyone would give opporitunities gifted us virus. Speaking introvert.

There MUCH done make masks appealing people. that, no, US decided (like Brazil) pretend virus exist. wear one run performance definitely suffers. runs also suffer humid think something that. almost think would better honest people sucks, performance probably go down, please anyway. West failed contain it, virus never would spread Chinese poor sanitation standards practice eating wild animals. zoonotic virus.

By way, Chinese race. nationality. idea many unique races comprise China? ‚ÄúExperts‚Äù Thank you!

My reaction hyperbole... Thank Mr. Portman. It‚Äôs brainwashing. taught anything brainwashing powerful force world. Win Hearts minds win war... Sounds like Melbourne. 


Welcome big time, guys. actually get started.  ""essential"" workers often meant essential business, rather essential keep society running.  Last week bunch nurses ER wearing masks. half. Honestly fuck, older mother car wreck, wore mask ambulance exam room, asshats can't fucking job keep healthy put fucking mask?

One literally coughing exam room. figured mixing people outside household indoors bad idea, stupid helped. shame stupidity kill others. people make money business uber competitive. reflect afterwards.

Steve Jobs way Gates pretty much. weird Russia claimed first make vaccine, yet even produced enough purported vaccine country inoculate citizens.  Google it?
But hey! Lets downvote! fake news! Doomsayers worst! Coronavirus reinfections common sars-cov2 different! Fake makes sense think class warfare. republicans, many democrats, want keep workers getting large amounts aid, they'll see possible demand more. European here. I'm confused reading good suggestions observations Dr. Fauci every days yet barely anything happens. What's position actually advise government ignoring it?

Also, still patience gone insane? Seriously. comment literally makes sense all, OK. Believe tales organizations. Apple link. Also available Spotify name. taught thermodynamics semester. professor used example month.

It's true, still face-palming university already strong anti-mask movement among students. professor forced TAs go in-person class sit front students despite absolutely role aside telling someone asked question Zoom cleaning room afterwards.

I mean I'm keeping real keeping necessary activities, stoke fire make sure risks reasonable payout. New Orleans here. going depend bad time.

From saw morning, peak current Fall/Winter wave right around inauguration January. Mardi Gras early next year, February 16. bet many people died, many still hospital, bad March. Fair say doomed even begin, then. Yeah telling didn‚Äôt respond saying sanctimonious shit life death. Funny mention don‚Äôt care public health actions demonstrate care length 2%‚Äôs breathing. don‚Äôt give shit struggles 98% nice guy debate honestly. command niceness warning. thinks morally superior NZ Covid Cup.

But yes, told locking would lead Sweden catastrophe. Collapse healthcare system. Bodies piling streets. Carnage. Nothing happened, instead, surplus death bit larger bad flu season, period hospitals got busier healthcare pressure, it. 

Even take ""league table"" approach. moment 18 countries larger death per million rate Sweden, Armenia Czech Republic due ""overtake"" us soon. Among countries 6 developed countries. 5 Western EU states. 8 European countries. bar maybe Bolivia Equador least middle income countries. bar Mexico parts US Brazil locked went distance never seen history humanity curb virus impeding social contact. 

For countries different excuse involving culture, wealth, demography, etc, lockdown important necessary, supercede everything? told, important anything else. Sweden, Belarus, Nicaragua firsts table mile. Even cook stats, possible perceive going hospitals seeing chaos, ambulances over, bodies flowing saw Ecuador Peru. 

It onus prove worth it. merely carried less common sense February. (should say us too, tecbically lockdown soon. Thank L√∂fven, remember) carried unseen experiment totally dark hoping stuff. Sweden counted going years vaccine never arriving heard sick Vietnam üò¨ that's truth! country lockdown skeptics use agenda? Police Madison County NY advertised Facebook enforce limits well.  Yup well lame upcoming year better less lame Lol fr ? Fauci said social distance right vaccine gets approved (implying months) needs get distributed shit even Fauci said spring could pretty normal time Something could agree on, guess, lol! One reason regular wards offer intermediate level care constant high flow nasal cannula.

No, Many (most?) countries give non-ventilator care ICU‚Äôs.

Such as? making bold statements without backing up. Many employees would willing stay home work, SBOs would willing shut assistance federal gov't. think federal program financial support would help lot. COVID deniers minority, shrinking; plus many already infected spreading COVID easily, least months. Exactly. People point headline think know talking about. always votes Democrats matters.

Always? Like Kavanaugh Supreme Court? Like he's already announced vote expand Supreme Court come vote (making proposal DOA even 50-50 Senate)? kind always?

As senator R state, Manchin knows vote base certain issues. past record shows he'd likely give base's anti-mask, anti-lockdown attitudes. üêò I'm white fuck, numbnuts.

Good you...I never assumed ethnicity, Vietnam big deal efficient vet straight face.

I never said, implied Vietnam war ""no big deal"", especially given draft still place...but ~1.4% total casualties incurred US respect lives lost, ""defending freedom""...in wars, always going causalities, way avoid avoid touch pathetic.

Enlighten then... Seriously wtf wrong people, ordering delivery amazon fresh since February I‚Äôm go taiwan there‚Äôs civil war 2 Iran gets bombed seriously dislike taiwan / mosquitoes / humid That's funny, assuming activities.

I go grocery store eat.

And what's relevance car wash??? one else auto wash... even anyway... wash car. like said went car wash stick credit card machine drive through... risky all? There's human interaction. Covid fucker puts people hospital fast

And also puts people slow too. effects various people differently like fucking 'who's first' viruses. condescending sub. recommending getting daily criticism media lately: blame internet many things. relation particular issue certainly facilitated spread stupid opinions. don't, however, catch drift comment. internet connected via ""conspicuous consumption"" ? well connection, elaborate. going high. businesses ordered shut week stuff like this. People care...unless get kids back school, and, make sure sex ed there. That‚Äôs untrue, unless you‚Äôre ok mucous, snot, sneezes landing face. know dirty American public want extra barrier respirator them. said that, glad Mardi Gras canceled.

Just curious, consider wanting recent years?

Mardi Gras 2018 - ""Louisiana Flu cases trending state officials worry another spike due Mardi Gras Gras 2019 - ""Flu outbreak New Orleans area reaches high level, officials tell people flu stay Gras 2020 - ""Health official says risk coronavirus New Orleans ‚Äòvery, low‚Äô warns flu Wait, what? exists? Maybe so, don‚Äôt know. clarify: outside listed article, labour voluntary?

I've seen bunch articles recent weeks prisoners paid slave wages non-american unsure voluntary forced (idk private prisons work entirely. They're completely government run live). Nice projection. I'm done speaking seeing perspective reality's perspective. u/tb0x  Yes, immune system works. Either prevent re-infection altogether produce mild case. See ""Only one person hospitalized time reinfection, still mild infection. deaths recorded. Viral genome sequencing confirmed four 12 cases available genetic evidence. Risk reinfection estimated 0.01%."" 

There serious re-infections, exception, norm. Notably, one person world far confirmed died re-infection, type chemo depleted memory B cells. her, second infection essentially first, body lack ability ""remember"" previous infections. See figured last week holiday, probably less tests performed and/or delay processing. going try impeach him, well? mean, change rules. Well like birthday, anniversary day first discovered. around least months time. Thank you. english bad today improved little bit. I'm hoping he's ease things. 

If full shutdown people would literally riot.

Yeah,I miss 'ol Amy.üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠   basically youre saying im right without vitriloic hyperbole name calling, rude little shit [We already going around since least September 2019. China fucked us. Here's businessinsider.com may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage, post automatically removed. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

Thank helping us keep information /r/Coronavirus reliable!


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* texas better medical care? well would depend meant capacity, beds equal capacity...but still stupid. Lives come money....hate fucked us is. way time person year anything ""The Essential Worker"". fits groups they've done more. Esp. since real impact likely felt next year anyways. isn't. get everyone else board STAY FUCK HOME! nurses doctors essential workers get overburdened sick die people ignorant refuse self isolate. Texas dealing cases long time, New York became epicenter. San Antonio took 20 first infected cruise ships kept recovery. cities counties great handle things earlier on. Harris Fort Bend County enacted shutdowns mask mandates cool (haha). course, governor came along kiss ass President, basically made orders counties unenforceable. people walk around exercise kinds shit without masks precautions authorities little.

This one reason I'm skeptical national plan. think overarching guidelines clearly defined federal level, takes counties cities effectively implement plan work population needs. Even governor likely far removed effectively manage every area state. every state county boat, one-size-fits-all plan seems ham-handed. hope leads better care vulnerable care homes. Never forget suffering death obstructionists Congress Trump administration condemned us to. I‚Äôve saying this! basic logical tenet, obtuse. genuinely think good argument say, ""Covid causes cancer, prove otherwise that's true""? No, **I** making claim requires evidence case Yep. amazing. couldn‚Äôt even manage national response Australia, despite begging do-nothing federal government SOMETHING, ANYTHING LOVE GOD, I‚Äôm sure much luck US have. I‚Äôm talking Sweden. Many (most?) countries give non-ventilator care ICU‚Äôs. kind mental hang-up. work 100 percent voluntary,‚Äù added. ‚ÄúIt's great individuals stepping volunteering assist community dire need help right now."" 10pm alcohol cut months now? keep patrons dining past 10, see change. 10pm alcohol thing Columbus rule, can't keep city vs state rules anymore. Especially since late since January anyways.


Groceries still allowed. Carryout/drive thru still allowed. least here, think change dining 10 banned.


Come back Amy Acton, never deserved you. case get paywall, here's I‚Äôll take advice positivity rate 35.4% surely missing cases. could twice many even more. little island helps that. live Wisconsin. hot mess people still going business (frequenting bars restaurants, etc) like 2019. many people refer ""hoax, cold, everyone's going get let's go life, etc"". 
 
It's going hit fan even worse real soon! probably meant whole globe general. problem fucking misinformed little slow understand science experts get conservative. even H1N1 Ebola. remember best friend like ""this scary. Buy perishable foods, stock everything need. going get much bigger"" early days this.

Can't believe mark was. Let vaccines thing. You‚Äôll ok. Hang went ahead reread information sent me. AZ study part selected people still community well people chronic health issues. 2/3 people got vaccine compared 1/3 got placebo. LMAO yes amd Fauci said (or want believe him) keep wearing masks distance afterwards Thanks. months ago 10% positive rate considered terrible I'm even sure make now.  greatest irony - world would done right wiped virus early serious lock downs globally us would right calling waste money effort tiny disease wiped quickly. 

Most Humanity realize serious deep shit middle it. see coming typically ignored general. Lmao. Hungarians really Americans Europe. No, I'm talking fact blacks China passports taken quarantined hotels blaming blacks. even forgetting this? big news couple months back, lots propaganda spread around government. fact, even made videos people showing doors blacks hotels fucking roses would make difference...

*""On April 12, Guangdong authorities announced foreigners province must accept ‚ÄúCovid-19 prevention containment measures‚Äù including ‚Äútesting, sampling quarantine.‚Äù practice, authorities targeted Africans forced testing quarantine. visited homes African residents, testing spot instructing take test hospital. ordered self-isolate home surveillance cameras alarms installed outside apartments.""*

... ""There evident scientific basis policy. imported cases Covid-19 province Chinese nationals returning abroad. Many Africans already tested negative coronavirus, recent travel history, contact known Covid-19 patients.""

It nothing right wing, dumbass. China literally known amongst racist countries world. get sit pretend high mighty shit. definitely get it... many capacities I‚Äôm pro-harm reduction philosophy, particularly person harm yourself.

In case COVID thinking gives false sense security, suggesting smaller unsafe things made safe solely aren‚Äôt large unsafe things. isn‚Äôt ‚ÄúI‚Äôm harming myself‚Äù situation, ‚ÄúIf get I‚Äôm almost certainly going harm someone else.‚Äù

A lot people attempt safer practices unsuccessful them‚Äîimproper PPE use, impossibility use PPE eating, bathroom contamination, alcohol, children following procedures, etc.

At point think ‚Äúyou need things, anything short standard non-compliant, unsafe, even illegal.‚Äù 

Trying make ‚Äúsafer‚Äù like trying make drunk-driving safer, fundamentally isn‚Äôt safe puts others risk. Even everyone holiday party consents hazard, infection likely spread others didn‚Äôt accept risk.

The pandemic fueled half measures ‚Äúwhat people willing do‚Äù, things less risky harm individuals criminal matters. im making observation. rhetorical. even Governors come agreement, lost cause. country split now. sheriff's said would enforce mask mandate. much ignorance. dumb selfish asses would infect kill own. That's going fuckall so, Florida hit yet.

Cases: 890K

Deaths: 17,558 Ah yes, cram people's visits fewer hours, people packed together likely get COVID. prisoners USA allowed decline labour? Like work time? Crazy woman got famous huge tits turns one wholesome people planet. get vaccine medical reasons. Fauci said believe yesterday. Wtf problem AHole? dont believe fauci? Talk him

Shove BS piehole fewer tests, seen numbers tests 15th, yesterday today. federal government wanted impose mask mandate, could.

Restrictions Congress Article 1 Section 9. Basically, almost none.

We mask mandate Republican Senate approve it.  That's all. Nurses Dr's also resources, higher patient load, they'll handle, spreading care thin. 

Source: ass passing guess went concert march 11th, week lockdown started live. crazy think now.  One surreal things 2020 husband went Presidents Day weekend New Orleans. first time blast checking parades, eating fancy Valentine's Day dinner Commander's Palace, wandering French Quarter, going WWII museum jam packed left started feel claustrophobic.

I mean, one final vacation pandemic, definitely right one! canceling parades definitely right decision. Yeah think thats pretty much it. PCP appt back April COVID started get real bad doctor walked right without mask (i also wearing mask beginning, didnt start taking precautions realized bad getting). get free antibody testing everytime donate blood somehow still coming back negative every time say believe scientists they're right

lmao Italy far late. point longer stop spread. trying limit number dead. boat US now. 

It's fairy tale imagine seriously reduce numbers. want stop rising faster need to, thereby limiting dead.

You could sit right pen paper pretty accurate math many dead current numbers. goal try shave percentages that. scientists r/COVID19 run N95 gets sweaty enough structure keep wet part away face. Click bait titles read headlines. 

People actually read... need those. IMO good making sacrifice family. gonna tough holiday season it'll get better eventually. stay strong friend. great anniversary -.- Let introduce /r/nonewnormal  good way shock people would show full hospitals people dying lack treatment. Sure, get point people running around screaming bad things one see bad helping average idiot understand severity situation. pandemic sort inevitable. Specific circumstances irrelevant. certainly didn‚Äôt vote Portman he‚Äôs made genuinely awful decisions eyes, absolutely respect this. Showing support science, willing participate clinical trial strong rebuke anti-intellectual sentiment party promoting. gravy? boat gravy commemorate loved ones. beds matter. beds world need skilled ICU staff can't make 6 months. Staff limiting factor. normal patient base older, ICU clears pretty quickly covids, last long. advice would make sure grandma comes thanksgiving, clear picture nice fast. And, bonus, save money christmas gifts food elderly relatives able spend inheritance! win-win situation. worry, they're gonna incorporate conspiracy theories soon enough. 

""Dolly Parton behind scenes *even stuff thought was* share wealth make world better place. get this...*a lot way encourages others help people well.*"" still read fucking article sent reinfection. absolute fucking waste oxygen. REINFECTION HAPPENS. Read fucking article recommendations people smarter you. Literally say fucking thing, ignorant tool. 


Dumbfucks saying ""I give two shits"" reason they're building tents outside hospitals treat new COVID patients. Great work! bullshit. I'm done talking morons day. though? locked 2 months state. retail shops, theaters, indoor *anything* really. School 100% remote, food contactless delivery drive thru. soon *lifted* that, cases skyrocketed. China still limit people traveling in/out country? ever rural outbreak like we're seeing U.S.? get used type outbreak (well, experienced are, anyway) way thing moving spreading, seems weird they're quite well. Or, still locked tight? Ugh. makes brain hurt think all. tried get overdraft business account bank straight like don‚Äôt know you‚Äôll open couple months arnt really lending moment.

My parents run company decades first rule mother taught banks aways want lend money need it, never want lend would make difference staying alive closing shop. 

It actually makes angry told that. Central banks flooding system free cash encourage banks lend banks responding hoarding, profiting interest rate differentials, denying loans businesses need it. 

As far I'm concerned, clearest message possible governments central banks need flow money bottom instead assuming it'll trickle banks. consistently get re-elected. I'm generally suspicious person, I'd say questionable elect!on fraud going on, carried people. can't really believe citizens states love abused like this. one said everyone would die. pulling from? whole point shut downs flatten curve, make sure medical facilities overwhelmed. Yeah, obviously work, get people go along them. real question voluntary lockdown effective mandatory one. goal kinds limit amount social contacts Sweden definitely voluntary lockdown spring. recommendations intended effect legal measures countries. worked quite well quick mandatory lockdowns Denmark Norway. difference measured days, weeks. 

There still bunch measures place spring reintroduced yet like limiting travel two hours home or, case Stockholm, leaving region all. Well, Kamala Harris part sow seeds doubt vaccination. worry she'll begging help soon enough. don‚Äôt think rest world understand seriously Americans take thanksgiving. people fly anywhere Canadian thanksgiving university students. Yes, funeral homes actually space accommodate. 

They might frozen months likely January/February really happens large spike. Ah yes. left restrictions place wouldn‚Äôt bad spot now. agree. need help. None said going happen. guess what...workout performance decreases humid weather. 85 40% humidity pleasant run 77 60% humidity.

Either slow run PE heart rate significantly higher. still playing misleading games names. failure condemn nonsense perceived small-scale always lead repeated large scale friends foes alike. Welcome America, absolute freak-show comes healthcare citizens...

Sit back enjoy watching priviliged survive rest us try survive piece pie even save one us.

This pandemic really shown bad economic inequality affect life country, literally difference life death many cases 100% people get infected shingles end dying eventually... Liquor stores open, DMV open, malls open, aquarium open...lol... safe right?

The protests cars Michigan, unsafe right? church services cars... unsafe right?

And doctor got photo op.. mean pint protest blick entrance. Stop drinking kool-aid I'd love see demographics hospitalizations. mentioned last week, selective goes ICU (not terms age only, condition) time admitting people earlier better shape recovery faster. Also lot people hospitalized wards, including people geriatric wards spring. 

But numbers aside (looking numbers lowers anxiety overall), I'd love see trends leveling going down. still unclear case - cases lowest lag fastest dynamics, dependent testing capacity close now, also number new confirmed cases bit flat know positivity rate period taken in, find Thursday week after.. 

I also excited see news vaccine development took day realize vaccines (when approved delivered) first offered health/care staff risk groups much later people.. basically, hang on, make good routines start planning hemester Christmas. I'm already preparing care package family home country presents everyone cause think possible responsible travel around Christmas. :sob: feel like mostly American thing. kind fascinating phenomena. much denial? Go look VA tell government run hospitals great aim for. Yes think it‚Äôs cover ass estimate. He‚Äôs trying suggest ‚Äò2nd wave‚Äô (what ever call it) isn‚Äôt bad seems nut ridiculous Seeing unbelievable amount people Twitter today saying masks work...with lots likes retweets

Can anybody share sources show masks effective?? ever turned away hospital accepting patients beds staff available? people shortly facing lot areas - including state article written. people area stupid self centered listen rational appeal **minor** behavior change prevent catastrophe, go graphic emotional approach. article fear mongering, attention grabbing headline - like almost media.

Covid killed unimaginable numbers people, cases rising absurdly fast right US, hospitalization death rates following weeks later.

Plus, anyone severe medical issue can't get treated facilities full covid patients. Car accidents, ladder falls, heart attacks, acute appendicitis, brain tumors, things usually survived fast specialized medical care going kill even people. saying thanks family keeping safe. Thanks great person! Shhhh cant speak common sense reddit.

Let live life fear. insulting there‚Äôs medical workers laid unable find new jobs US profit system hit hard COVID lack surgeries. went protests? suggesting protests got sick even though never went? tell many times inside eating people. medical industry want pick fight cancel culture. 

This worst big brain take I've ever seen. 

Why tell credentials makes knowledgeable disease spread? can't see that... help you.

I'll tell see. access data everyone state catches communicable diseases get reported state. several months tracked covid people got state. want know who, time again, keeps getting sick confused they're getting sick? people eating inside restaurants going church. know, usually type complaining protests. imagine, kind person are. know never case across desk for? People protesting much else. spread outdoors wearing mask. spreads inside flapping Yap family members eating mouths open right next you. That's nice got sick even though wore mask. hardly indicative outside mask dangerous inside without one. That's indicative know talking looking scapegoat. never really coming Trump's people, drug researchers ones presenting initial findings. given Trump strong-armed CDC much, extent FDA, interference premature claims real concern. looks like happen, reassuring. Immaturity, brains wired short term pleasure. Gimme gimme gimme everything right now, month lifetime away cares far off. astounding many people forsake holiday 2020 well. know people two holidays totalling three weeks since July occasions bother isolating came back. Key point headline, found China. Virus found much earlier elsewhere. (Not pointing fingers) rarely comment. try help understand something someone get attacked. 

Being infected automatically mean get sick even develop detectable viral loads. see constantly animals studies infect different doses pathogen and/or vaccine. definitely infected, person share room extended periods time positive person. confusion may arrived fact infected person society come mean contagious. probably right make clear enough meant 99% certainty contagious (even though definitely assume act accordingly I'm sure does), 99% certainty infected. 20% referred perhaps percentage got sick infected? 

Where cannot follow admit wrongdoing timeline. test people five days exposure (before system got overwhelmed) 7 days later. average takes 5-10 days produce enough virus easily measured nasal swabs. official incubation period SARS-CoV2 believe 4-14 days, even always exceptions.

Anyway. already spent much time this. think twice ever trying comment again. I'm sure post mind long time, even tough wanted help someone professional opinion virologist/molecular biologist... shit - glad worked - July outbreak worst... far. ""things looking better!"" attitude make holiday season even worse. :( workplace used strict no-telework stance, virtual effective person.

Well received mandate go 100% virtual least much possible, stood telework system, sent everybody home. We've meetings since reporting performance affected all, issues minor quickly corrected, basically fears telework unfounded. indeed read that's definitely downvoted lol think might Final Stranding Amelie referring to. Yeah that's northern Florida. people see wearing masks younger people. seems older crowds can't bothered put one even though vulnerable. husband still get dirty looks go inside anywhere almost public places requiring masks wear anyways. think one week city council mandated masks people freaked called removed positions city said fuck it. insane. put mouthwash humidifiers!? /s find lot private care docs ones likely think covid bs. Probably basically small business owners see shutdowns threat paychecks. likely change behavior year? human rights organizations, countries claim believe human rights, passive Iranian sanctions middle pandemic? countries organizations publicly constantly demanding sanctions lifted humanitarian reasons?

Why countries organizations quiet? Ok, and? ok push people buildings old people? Yeah they‚Äôre going back home 3 houses Glad someone else said it. either bullshit intentionally misleading serve fuel Covidspiracy crowd opposing masks first place. That's depressing headline. would prefer bed sheraton. ""bed"" typical hospital like slab concrete I've working remotely almost decade now, personally prefer hangouts seems least obtrusive (I want bells whistles separate program plugin something, let us connect talk). importantly, everywhere I've worked used gSuite (or whatever used called), kind built ecosystem anyways - example send calendar invite meeting there's option add hangouts link invite.

I'm really sure zoom took off, guess got enough sort hand-holding individual participants organizers really fit niche needed suddenly millions people thrust onto virtual meetings without warning. Y'all act like covid plague... 99% get recover it, like flu. uncommon deer camp 2-3 people group really / good fill everyone's tags rest drink.

This people wear masks, people make decisions crisis like pandemic. Really fascinating stuff!

I‚Äôve worked US actually countries well seems like crew, every crew work along side building towers tends kinda thinking thing time. Hard labor intensive work decades tends breed certain type person guess. already canceled thanksgiving plans, gonna fly home see mom I‚Äôd rather keep safe. Seems like everyone followed basic rules people follow ill flu would lot better off. Problem isc like said, think people don‚Äôt even know it.  skip sympathize others despise mothers. And, it‚Äôs visceral time can‚Äôt stomach rawness it. policy abortion too. doesn‚Äôt nothing. Asian countries adopted optional, situationally-appropriate mask-wearing decade seem much lower mortality rates pandemic. won‚Äôt wear mask time future could sure come handy variety situations. I‚Äôm teacher two kids guarantee I‚Äôll still exposed kinds germs, could suffer ONE less bad virus every March, don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs bad thing. Getting sick every time fly plane ruins vacations. also want eighty year-old mother protect pneumonia, someone age focus prevention rather building immune system. It‚Äôs time, wearing mask give little extra protection high-risk situations smart. Research, including medical research, often biased. race.

Granted start next year may suck. years holidays super!


/$ sample 30,000 95.  Doesn‚Äôt say 2.2% death rate (for US) reading wrong? Man! Wish Pelosi accepted cash money covid stimulus. Would made Angie difference vulnerable people country! Man Trump try!! seen California San Francisco particular. bums pooping lawns mansions. even people symptoms deny COVID, people without symptom take vaccines social distancing seriously? disagree, false information. ""lockdown light"" planned November ""we'll evaluate works"" backdoor, clearly said ""save christmas"". Making lets say implying promises know can't keep lying book.

Sure, crystal ball, expect? Dropping numbers two weeks? 4 week ""lockdown light"" enough get back tracable levels like 50/100.000 less? 

That's problem: annouce 4 weeks make (vague) promises christmas season know work upfront? think telling truth would lower acceptance restrictions? still think plain honest would better alternative salami tactics: 4 weeks. Ok, need extend restrictions. Sorry, another bit more. Oh, oops, bit longer.

They could said: Sorry, forget christmas larger family, forget travelling holidays, forget new year, really get better months. Oh hear you. I'm sorry things rough now. good advice then. usually tell eventually pass get times. Try think light end tunnel! Thats need see vaccinated people contact corona virus. believe then. He's bit confused, he's got spirit. keep arguing keep valved n95s away public easily surgical mask top nuts. see people loose masks nose exposed time. everyone's cloth mask protects like recent claims, anyone worried others wearing? add up. I‚Äôm tired winning :( What‚Äôs funny constant threats long term effects Covid (which around less year). Yet people celebrating vaccine still isn‚Äôt even approved less 100k people even taken it. Whatever side you‚Äôre (or sides) there‚Äôs massive hypocrisy everywhere- it‚Äôs hilarious. believe airline allow that, ill look delta 's policies vegan stuff stock couple weeks.

Hockey arenas always ice. Take example American Airlines Center Dallas Mavericks play basketball Dallas Stars play Hockey. ice always set properly prior matches. 


There rinks ice pretty much constantly change settings ice gone move things around concrete want basketball court. 100% support making personal choice even know talking about. I‚Äôve seen claims person sick beginning (think like majority states began lockdowns) recently reinfected positive test confirmation. yeah 7 ish months give take. I‚Äôm sure tons things factor long antibodies last though.  Unfortunately seems like they're waaaay common think, I've seen couple past months.

Hi. access therapy, support systems? not, perhaps unfollowing social media subs accounts triggering news following ones focus meditation gratitude might worthwhile. I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre difficult time. think realize regardless whether stronger lockdown happens not, life going go back ‚Äúbefore‚Äù quite time, finding ways manage depression regardless government top priority. Hope find hope day day life :/ Donald, no! 2020 convinced pandemic destroys society know it. pandemic, circumstances right, think one eventually devastate civilization. Imagine multiple pandemics hypothetically occur once, succession. one perfect balance infection speed vs lethality. big thing COVID shown can't completely shut global society weeks, think need find way able mitigate future doomsday scenarios, pandemic otherwise. watching Kingdom yesterday one character drives 90‚Äôs Civic think? shoulder belt detached one scene get watch follow track belt attached, haha. thought funny pointed out. Repeating herd immunity strategy make true. evidence lacking blown proportions international media.

The evidence quite lacking, say least. One hand emails public health officials scientists discussing various strategies outcomes, herd immunity one them. hand, recommendations restrictions place limit spread much possible, government FHM time said need keep vaccine widely available.

And bullshit dangerous consequences. use country example need lock down, others use example let virus run wild. becomes problem, whole premise based false facts.

Sweden softer approach countries, based idea people actually follow recommendations place without needed backed law. measures also tad softer neighbours vast majority time.

Don't get wrong, good number things Sweden wrong (e.g. lack crisis preparedness acting slow), weird thing never focus. Sweden always gets criticized things even true, actual mistakes, triggers me. Bet I'd wager antimaskers antiseatbelt

In country political party antimask filled people used anti seatbelts. moderna vaccine trial.

I‚Äôd compare tetanus shot. kicked ass 12 hours fine. Ibuprofen, water, rest you‚Äôll fine time. I‚Äôm baby comes sick, handle anyone can. Sweden high level immunity

Yea Sweden looking real juicy rn said 5%? Chinese statistics January 0.5~1% mortality. Seriously. powers going learn humanity cannot make appropriate decisions themselves. proven time time simply ability make correct decision even much information disposal. fucking put foot already!! compare current wave. cases summer rapid growth september oktober resulting full blown crisis november Italy Europe.

How long window though? That's suspiciously unanswered makes difference world. effect good for, say, 4 hours leave home get back might lot good. 

But makes difference 10 30 minutes going practical help all. that's important know. seems like virus already breeding body simply killing what's sitting saliva work amount gets replaced, imagine pretty quick. face mask requirement includes exceptions, including public safety workers whose duties would hindered face mask. 

 heck?? election two weeks ago. Might something it.   Yikes Priority risk groups.

Yes, linked wikipedia page says this. available info says covid19 much worse pandemic, highlights pandemics same. I'm sure confusing that?

Flu, whether ""pandemic"" not, causes many deaths every year we've alive. USA flu, estimated 61,000 deaths.. 

January 2018 Los Angeles flu called ""war this, LA residents packing NBA games, movie theaters Jumanji Star Wars Last Jedi, etc. - goes along ""rugged individualism"" comment mentioned chain replied to. whiny babies sacred holiday gluttony, swear.

Who referring to? every level football, amateur high school college NFL (including CFL Canadian Thanksgiving), plays football Thanksgiving Day (Thursday) immediately following holiday weekend (Friday, Saturday, crowds spread flu, flu kills, CDC says USA flu season starts October, yet millions Americans lifetimes 2020 have, better worse, year year packed Thanksgiving football games little concern germs, even 2009 pandemic, 2018 flu ""war zone.""

Good point. people funeral ""you drama Queens!""  used live Ohio. He‚Äôs actually pretty well liked sides aisle. Like he‚Äôs insane like lot current GOP middle America South. :( chimp typewriter gonna write Shakespeare 10 months late. happened mid-January soon first cases occurred Washington state. wouldn‚Äôt surprise start seeing vaccine tourism places, things like kidney transplants, etc. BS article obviously written get clicks ""WE MAKE IT"" Like really? entire world going end. Stop click bating shitty articles nobody watches news anymore. Oh honey... don‚Äôt understand burnout works. Seriously speaking, ‚Äústupid‚Äù ‚Äúdesperate‚Äù I‚Äôd seriously comfortable placing high 90s, especially March.

There number flat lied family members, victimized non-familial housemates, believed inconsistent, watered down, ‚Äúwhat people willing do‚Äù health safety messages, guidelines, policies. Interesting. That‚Äôs lot! ridiculous. ""You dare put lord's name vain flexible one year?! MUST DIE."" hate JRE now, show gone completely shit, guests suck he's moron many levels. Hate hate hate. This, one good thing SD. Right, mention faking deaths much, hospitalization rates would \*also\* need faked. Nobody wants believe though.   things don‚Äôt happen linear scale. always outliers. mental thing get used cause first time lifting damn near panic attack lol

Some people sensitive inhaled CO2, causing feelings panic. Nestor talks new book, *Breathe*. I'm American.

I seen one friend since March.

Meanwhile nobody else giving crap.

So try jump queue then? everything got crapped on.  Japanese believe honorary white people, they're trying. Lol dude ridiculous. vaccinate risk people healthcare workers death rate low resume normal life. 

Spring 2021 good timeline. Last week said one vaccines could submitted FDA approval week. still track? in, see headline Friday, complain? Dude bet could make work. Would safe building standard codes? Probably not, still. pope hurry cannonize woman already?

Thank live too.  upvote you. I'm sure that's bothering I'm sorry good day. probably still alive jumped. guess. mardi gras actually religious holiday (ironic) can‚Äôt postponed 95 percent population. could go wrong? Cuomo can't say fought POTUS Hasidic Jews POTUS NY. So, can't anything now, politics dictating does, instead science. Good him. logic follows isn‚Äôt ‚ÄúBig fucking deal.‚Äù It‚Äôs BFD far many, deaths long-term health consequences actually big fucking deal, sorry. Fun fact. could pay medical costs directly save $500B year.

Why dont they? Ever notice Obama‚Äôs salary President rich now? Probably going smoke ham. yeah aint either chief Federalism centralized authoritarian control
 
Every day week twice Sundays. this, we're getting arrested. guy used Twitter incite violence, ban him.  Ok can't wait til mid 2021 lol people need take action meaning 'elective', wiki article, perfectly clear nothing multi-word expressions.

There meaning ""elective."" ""Elective procedure"" meaning. ""Elective,"" context, not. multi-word expression. Clearly understood fact yet. sipping away Mt Gay Rum Barbados time last year without care world going on. Sunshine bliss. remember hearing something new disease TV shrugged ‚Äúthat‚Äôs China, whatever‚Äù....give another Rum Punch, M‚Äôam! Look Europe. Sweden Germany took dramatically different approaches yet still spiked around time other. last paragraphs article linked:

The study notes research needed assess whether immune response maintained longer term better understand strength cellular immune response corresponds likelihood reinfection.

Professor Paul Moss, U.K. Coronavirus Immunology Consortium lead University Birmingham, said work needed find people symptomatic Covid-19 safer future reinfection.

‚ÄúInterestingly, found cellular immunity stronger time point people symptomatic infection compared asymptomatic cases. need research find symptomatic individuals better protected reinfection future.‚Äù

Since I‚Äôm healthcare look medical journals studies following data vs general media sources. exhausting trying keep up. I‚Äôm consider somewhat smart near level smart people forefront science. It‚Äôs going really know one way everything between. 

I don‚Äôt view cautious making careful assessments still many unknowns fearful controlled. live age seeing science evolve real time access data pretty much real time- aspect absolutely fascinating. Looks like middle aged Skeletor. people covid pull bootstraps. guy Adult Swims. protests, bike rallies, Biden celebrations, Trump rallies etc etc etc ashamed really. simple ask gathering large crowds thousands. care even 100% masked (which clearly weren't) large gathering beyond irresponsible. 

It's bad enough get empression president taking seriously, get impression none citizens taking seriously matter end political spectrum on. I'm trying convince family Christmas year. want party like 30 people dad would oldest person there. Screw that, I'm willing sacrifice one Christmas ensure dad's health. Unfortunately country can't seem sacrifice crap sit around blame government want power what's right need government mandate it. Yet completely blowing it. Yeah well fuckin hard ok death tragic, even one many. think mask mandate would stop virus it‚Äôs tracks; sadly, isn‚Äôt case. Look Minnesota, Wisconsin, Illinois ‚Äì states mask mandates still seeing rapidly increasing cases. Since start pandemic, Governor Noem focused solutions good, solutions FEEL good. She‚Äôll continue trusting South Dakotans exercise personal responsibility make best decisions loved-ones.‚Äù

Man, seriousness, fuck people running state. Sure let‚Äôs    It‚Äôs great plan. 

We help secede even. 

Hello, 
Singapore 2.0   Dr Scott Atlas ABSOLUTELY CORRECT. said ""you get accept"".

It's time stop accepting behavior sitting (golfing, really) President lackeys. voted, lost. I'm Christian either, hear lot Americans are. Like, double-digit 

Taking comment face value: [yes recently last year, 65% Americans identify Christian. 20% religious affiliation.  tell first hand dangerously close turning people away ER door South Dakota. hospital diverting patients (Helicopters ambulances) month. single empty bed hospital; single ICU bed unless count neonatal ICU. holding 20+ ER patients today waiting admission. 
This effect experiencing symptoms covid. health care emergency state altogether likely receive treatment. lot people going needlessly die otherwise treatable conditions lack healthcare access. I'm now. Lol moment upset, 2020 stress came pouring out. brat, getting wanted. 
It's fine though. miss one night out, better getting plague. Lol great, thanks! evidence Florida protecting anyone anything. trust information behind better math... /s Unfortunately, legally fit. Terrorism though? could fit legally. one dog, would take everywhere dogs allowed including restaurants. good socialization. stupidity too. heard say it, like TV?

I completely forgot Benazir Bhutto died... I'm reading her. Crazy Muslim-majority country elected woman PM 30+ years ago US got first female VICE president. Damn, what's like rich? Kidding. even homes bad neighborhoods ""million dollar homes"" makes sense. missed chance buy home 2010. Yeah! Paid Crisis Actor ads FB! Tealpainter one 'em! can't cure stupid. segment population believes fit narrative world view, obviously fake/rigged etc.   science decision. Younger kids haven‚Äôt found super spreaders. It‚Äôs high school college age kids are, likely things school rather happens school day. facing consequences actions hard accept ‚Äúboth sides‚Äù bullshit GOP getting away everything. SO, brother, going Thanksgiving us LA. probably virtual lunch family back home Indiana. Bad news us already mental health issues begin with... Welcome United States  Musk reminds brain surgeon Ben Carson: extremely talented certain technical matters, fucking dimwit everything else. disagree. Tons legit Mexicans Chicago. Mexican food legit. We‚Äôre rounding final corner track hit starting line  mean let go home don‚Äôt believe? people sign likely die need oxygen? me, it‚Äôs beyond that. 

I hope mankind pull together tough times. 

Inequality. Pollution. Climate change. 

These insane issues anything need mankind pull together fight together. 

Covid shown largely doomed.

 Ironically may brains science ability, half planet going pull us back 13 steps corner (fuck masks, conspiracy theory, stop caring) simply doomed. early. numbers 20-25% compared day last week. We've 20-30%+ increases week week several weeks. 'good' note testing cases captured, treatments improving death rate less severe. issues one (1) raw cases translate certain number deaths, (2) many hospitalizations reduce quality care leading deaths. ones scream magic medicine Joe Biden going ruin USA. gasping breath 100% Vapotherm. tell must another reason sick. call names ask wear ‚Äústuff‚Äù don‚Äôt COVID it‚Äôs real.‚Äô***

Thank you, Mister President, fucking us Royally. food stuff major reason California rules. really putting aside desert Joshua tree Palm Springs desert. Shit, even needles awesome. deaths per 100,000 population pretty useful metric use place IFR see country doing.

That's even flawed metric comparing less developed countries developed ones since demographics different. Look Yemen compared US. median age Yemeni 19.8 years old 2.8% Yemenis age 65. median American 38.5 years old 16.9% Americans age 65. even get various co-morbidities citizens developed countries likely have. example, many Yemenis obese Type II diabetic? I‚Äôm Texas. 

Wish Governor quarter balls Gov. Whitmer has. Unfortunately tree took legs seems taken nuts common sense too. stark condemnation that‚Äôs *if we‚Äôre lucky*.  power denial.. people cannot face pandemic happening. Sounds like trumpets. baby dane named Atlas. 

I'm appalled shares name man. live CA would take lot move. house next door sold quickly bidding war - people moved Arizona Oh yeah one Americans didnt trust cause Russia something another Thank you.

Any tips? I‚Äôd almost rather smell back it‚Äôs awful. tweets: Many continue rage reality even die.

It's quite surreal watch. anyone else deal extended family members making constant passive aggressive comments annoyed family part big holiday get togethers planning holding year? 

I'm tired it. Uncounted excess death figures higher first wave. Oh, worse shingles, I‚Äôve _had_ shingles. Shingles excruciating, it‚Äôs surface pain. Coronavirus long-term side effects pulmonary circulatory systems, that‚Äôs terrifying. 

Will medical life insurance companies refuse cover people it, charge exorbitant rates, way (and often still do) HIV? Nonsense friend. disease run course they're dead, rock-paper-scissors leftovers society.

Except rare cases don‚Äôt take vaccine ones risk, unlike ones refuse wear masks endanger others. Good. goofy studies, lies political conspiracy theorists invented remind Andrew Wakefield. vaccine? school work. :) single thing  ascertainment bias? anyone check see one? youre somewhere thats still warm theres reason inside Yeah understand that. Sorry least time alone promise make yourselves.
One best friends one really close x-mas birthdays. pick day June like he's expecting send birthday gift.

Actual dates seem terribly important people family always least one often several us working holidays like Christmas, Thanksgiving find good time get together celebrate holiday. Pretty much birthdays anniversaries.

I guess new hardship lot people case eat twice year know much must look forward that. forever though. season speak. make experience sweeter safe enjoy again. people remember one person vaccine trial Brazil died (turns given placebo) fast news spread? many reposts story? 1000? (A lot corona Italy 2019 story).

Expect FLOOD stories death suffering within days people getting vaccine. Expect horror stories, grown ups getting autism suddenly worse.

How social media platforms handle crazy stories? know media part care, need clicks go business, social platforms? really new normal pretty much old one  country isn‚Äôt days?  grandfather wife‚Äôs side 92, fever two days, awaiting results. sister-in-law doesn‚Äôt believe virus hanging him, unmasked, last week. brother-in-law kid‚Äôs basketball game tonight, including going team restaurant afterwards.

The common denominator conservatives. think locked hard? lol people really understand effectiveness safety vaccines change quickly equivalent yelling ‚Äúfire!‚Äù crowded building??? Thank good sir.

Might affect take it, unless someone unable take (immunocompromised, etc.). might able go much. think would loved :/ reading wrong. case fatality rate (CFR) higher infection fatality rate (IFR), people would think ""death rate"". directly measure CFR, due large number asymptomatic people, estimate IFR.

For example, say 100 people got infected. virus circulating system reproducing cells, may may gotten sick. make math easier, let's say 50 went doctor got positive diagnosis, 50 didn't. People latter group maybe get sick all, got mild illness go doctor, went doctor tested negative reason.

If one 100 people died, would give CFR 2% (1 50) 50 diagnosed cases, IFR 1% 100 people infected. One states counting neonatal ICU total even though beds areas appropriately sized adult even child, including lowers occupied percentage Tell sprained ankle can't walk. Seriously, can't persuade great idea travel &amp; gather right now, choice make shit stand him. wanted, could make ice cubes put tall glass Corona beer lime? distractions, 8 hour work day effectively 12 hours. round corners four times end beginning.

Many people give shit packed restaurants bars indoor dining. Wasn‚Äôt last Monday around 660? much prevent think going 2,200 deaths day Jan. 1,"" said Dr. Vin Gupta, pulmonologist affiliate assistant professor UW Medicine Seattle.

i would say reach 7day moving average close figure 2-3 weeks would ever worse Jan. hope right 200 last Monday exactly. capital realizes short term losses climate change outweigh short term gains anything it. Government could nudge this, government largest economy planet entirely captured capital point. faster development cycle could used correct flu strains missed maybe? Unfortunately consequence 1) close election 2) Biden winning Trump longer even respond try. Before, least required state jibberish publicly.

If thought didn‚Äôt face consequences actions before, absolutely zero incentive give shit. Yeah get high risk people enough lower hospitalization return normal They'd get sued closed churches. capacity restrictions tight churches barely operational anyway. starts effecting economy, thsts bad enough. irony infections spread schools, spread schools, least that's numbers clearly say. zero larger outbreaks classes, always single cases (plus many quarantine close contact).

If keep economy open, people keep communiting work, see significantly lower numbers...just shutting leisure activities maybe schools work. 

Of course noone wants blame economy main source spread, people spend day? meet far one household? sit/stand together tightly loads strangers? way work, work. companies adapted, many care even try forbid usage coronavirus app work. unqualified quack using pseudoscientific *feelings* *sports team talking points* inciting insurrection. Covid skeptics last get it.

Seriously seeing many families canceling Thanksgiving together even Christmas /New Year celebration 50?! Try one city county states live work (live one work another)! Neither state comprehensive plan residents I'm able put graph use current case numbers, essentially, hitting straight line would lead insane amount uncontrolled spread, right? 

In super layman's terms: almost everyone would get unless cautious able work home? I'm genuinely curious anyone knows many doctors nurses die influenza year. got much less that, right? Thats good, like said own. dont like shoveling snow, scraping car, love seeing winter wonderland chicago become, general like around seasons weather here. also politics, cali isnt gun friendly, Illinois isnt, slightly better cali. Also, lots people asymptomatic develop mild symptoms. benefit would vaccine people?

Apparently none, since Moderna Pfizer test asymptomatic people, symptomatic ones. We, people, need ‚Äúrise up‚Äù stop listening morons. Actually, better descriptor **traitors**. problem 99 percent people get corona, like flu. It‚Äôs hard get people care something doesn‚Äôt affect them. round filed it. time would good Russia interfered...might get 6 millionüëç Yes. California Washington state consistently low cases, relative states. 

We also tight restrictions, since March. 

Its quite bad. great,, nowhere new normal.. But... check month. love you, bizarro! Yep, knew something useful, numbers new cases would react?

Now US learn. town dying local mall I'm hoping demand places shop hang in-person combined Biden's policies like increased minimum wage making money flow easily zaps back life Massachusetts $300 fines.

Now may show, currently law questions everyone asking Moderna released details trials. short, know. Atlas ""shrugged"" said? That‚Äôs key skill Kremlin knows. likely little both. Covid-19 going away forever, ""doing this"" small degree 2022-2023. also going much control life feel significantly normal. 0 1, fuzzy logic instead.  Sealab 2021 seems you‚Äôre suggesting allow illegal government power grabs people thing ‚Äúthey‚Äôre good‚Äù. 

I disagree. 

And too. Imagine you‚Äôd respond Trump declared power stay office Covid. 

Half country would agree ‚Äúthis good right thing do‚Äù.

But good thing laws stop it, huh? going make people snap. think going get worse honestly. think done purpose they're trying endanger country form sick revenge. general population unlikely see main benefits mass vaccination next spring. better safe sorry vaccine widely available. false positives testing. cases people shed virus months. rare reinfections. 

So possible right now's one worst times take unnecessary chances.

Here's CDC data indicate persons mild moderate COVID-19 remain infectious longer 10 days symptom onset. Persons severe critical illness severe immunocompromise likely remain infectious longer 20 days symptom onset. Recovered persons continue shed detectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA upper respiratory specimens 3 months illness onset, albeit concentrations considerably lower illness, ranges replication-competent virus reliably recovered infectiousness unlikely. "" Ugh ew can‚Äôt stand much Kremlin loves drag proposants everything do. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre like spetsnaz world medical distribution‚Äù says country shipped PPE contaminated Covid western countries ‚Äúhelp‚Äù them. Question - According NPR: 

The results vaccines come interim analyses large clinical studies. Moderna study 30,000 volunteers. Half got two doses vaccine 28 days apart; half got two shots placebo schedule.

There 95 instances COVID-19 illness among study participants; five cases vaccinated group. Ninety group receiving placebo. these, 11 cases severe disease. results indicate vaccine inducing kind immune response protects people exposed coronavirus.

I've directly leaped burning hatred. wonder making money somehow. Spoiler:  20 *January* noon. Yeah guess point actually work, involve interacting households. sounds awful, is. that‚Äôs works. welcome!

I also mention couple interesting things come data source....

You'll notice CFR Yemen 29.2%, Mexico 9.8%, Egypt 5.8%, compared 2.2% US. could possible people COVID countries somewhat likely die US. also possible numbers high they're finding many positive cases people die. It'd like previous example 3 (Yemen) 10 (Mexico) 20 (Egypt) 100 went doctor got diagnosis. (Yemen's health system destroyed ongoing civil war, they're probably less diagnosis *and* people dying due lack doctors.)

The deaths per 100,000 population pretty useful metric use place IFR see country doing. Tiny countries (San Marino, Andorra) going weird statistical outliers. disturbing see high numbers Belgium, Peru, Spain source.

We've gotten pretty well-educated guesses actual IFR based ratios symptomatic asymptomatic people getting tested. tests do, better estimate get people different health situations. probably owns bunch Biotech stock. done incitement. serious situation someone position influence. 

Will repercussions leaders officials irresponsible like this? Zero ICU? Yikes, don‚Äôt stroke heart attack emergency. Screw anti vaxxers. get sick that's them. delay fully reopening them... went CNN watched it.

I suspect nurse's biases strongly shaped perceptions.  Patients come barely able breathe want think something else matter. (Sounds like something I'd do, think covid real.)  Dying patients simply flat see could happening them, covid real.  sounds like disbelief, maybe denial, anger rage.  Many new agers political liberals simply can't believe anger rage drive every right wing person's every waking moment.  

I also wonder much heard delirium.

Find fiction even well written history interest characters become like companions too.
It's matter riding bad storm, priority keeping people care strangers safe til passes clean mess. ironic? bro seriously can't tell  Eight billion people, actually. mind got covid make it.  risk tolerance

Heh, that's kinda attitude that's making winter much fun. /s Oh... try avoid makes sense thanks heads God help they're black. ignorant care people die understand learn virus time goes Jesus fucking Christ. also talks disinfecting store bought items important hygiene? using delivery services basic goods WORSE purchasing goods store? 

I envy blissful ignorance anti-mask crowd anxiety compounds every day. would cruelest outcomes ;\_; Trump Republicans already shown give shit Constitution, rest us Governor Texas said cities sued El Paso open back up. everywhere  Considering basically flu small pox comparison really good analogy. things addictive delicious. applaud making right choice. Nobody forgetting body language exists. 

Facial expressions noticeable aspect emotional expression people generally like seeing people smile gives sense mutual agreement liking other. don‚Äôt care doesn‚Äôt mean people don‚Äôt. This. world seems people spend life block house around people spout similar nonsense. huge problem America. Every person America sent packing year live somewhere grew up. would solve insanity instantly. fire? man tried soliciting murder. Everyone Trump's orbit looks like TV show sleaze bag. Please don‚Äôt downvote honest question - lot people around expressed concern getting ‚Äúrushed vaccine‚Äù process scares normally takes years. could know far whether side effects process really much different normal vaccine? 28 counties got moved purple tier, severe level scale. means case rate greater 7 per 100K and/or case positivity rate higher 8%. triggers closing ""non-essential"" indoor businesses.

There's map county levels second motion. favor, say üëÄ people studies thinking vaccine, operating everyone (on crazy stay-at-home versus kiss everyone see spectrum) difference couple hundred children dying couple hundred children thousand people near children thousand near se¬∑di¬∑tion/s…ôÀàdiSH(…ô)n/ *noun*

1. conduct speech inciting people rebel authority state monarch.  ruled stay home order several months ago. One positive one conservative judges replaced liberal justice since ruling. bench first case order would struck down.  already socialism instituted Banks major companies traded stock market. completely Capitalist society, started bailing fortune 500 companies October Covid even started globally. Also, time becomes available people we'll probably months data early recipients. think Pfizer said hoping deliver 15 20 million doses end year. Compared initial 30,000 person trial that's waaaay data least months people get shot. Sure controlled tracked there's massive widespread side effect would probably see it. Maybe know there's side effect five years line, would ease worry something like sudden heart attacks whatever. Ehhh would probably forget bullet proof vest mask. 


Bullets flu heard rate we'll need lot fewer vaccines. Sheesh. believe symptoms sign got vaccine. I‚Äôll know sure antibody test Yeah, I'm going continue walk dog, thanks. - can‚Äôt see facial expressions super depressing

- glasses fog like mad

- breathing little difficult certain circumstances 

- yes, muffled noises Two things:

1. think spirit ban reasonable, safety oriented, interest public, personally probably observe letter.
2. Good luck defending unconstitutional ban court. Lockdown works. would thought that? Sure pal. Sure. denies problem day? Trump. Gtfo bullshit. 12 million Americans Corona! repeat, 14 million Americans Corona... point realise 20 million infected putting rest us risk? 30 million least forced wear masks. better yet, put 50 million quarantine. that's opinion, someone minority Americans Corona Virus. Americans want get it. need government propaganda campaign bully people getting it. Damn, seen ""woot"" while. w00t. people totally sequestered rest society would problem that. economies interconnected would almost impossible completely shut borders even short while, let alone year more. Even borders ""shut"", nowhere near closed New Zealand's.

People often live one country work another. Truckers need drive transport goods. cities even basically split two countries. things make much, much harder EU country keep virus NZ Australia. 

For example, Sweden's third largest city Malm√∂ Denmark's capital Copenhagen interconnected basically form large metropolitan region. thousands people living Malm√∂ allowed commute work Copenhagen, vice-versa? Trust people California understand much shit show state too. Sounds like Canada. got first flu shot year I've gotten far arm pain like 1-3 days *maybe* fatigue later day. Totally worth vs. getting flu. kids still required shots go public school, think standards public safety's sake dystopian I‚Äôm approaching 25th annivesary also dining two. still exciting romantic even years. 

Have fun cherish other! üòäü•∞  Yeah guess, ones hot water hookups definitely market cheaper end spectrum.

Well...I lost NNN. I‚Äôm sorry would power move that. could get away everything especially shipped hospitals. two vaccines, around 30k study Prioritizing moves front line going giant giant shit show. 



I know happen. world place.

If science followed used guide distribution vaccine United States, **the goal save lives possible.** means vulnerable people nearer front line. less vulnerable people required move back line. 

What means white people pushed back. people color prioritized - dying white people.

I would love see come pass. science used. know won't. Dear lord baby Jesus please make happen! Summary

Living COVID-19 patient increased risk contagion 60 times.

Walking dog increases risk contagion COVID-19 78%.

Working site workplace increased risk contagion 76%.

Obtaining basic products using home delivery service raised risk contagion compared shopping store. 

The effective hygiene measure reducing prevalence disease disinfection products purchased market upon arrival home reduced risk 94% Also lot people know planning kid said ‚ÄúI‚Äôll wait Covid‚Äù. pent demand need survey figure switched Swingline Boston stapler, I'll keep Swingline bind much. Right? Like straight give people‚Äôs spare parts keep alive.

I‚Äôm one I‚Äôm worried about, fuck thinking someone else change  

Definitely genetic, read somewhere certain genetic mutations scientists identified cause person's immune system attack itself. Depends definition ""mandate"". mean forced take it, that's something never happen. mean ""can't unless vaccinated"", think probable. think offer people paid leave, lightening work/school responsibilities, etc. people get vaccines well, would seriously motivate people take vaccine instead continuing risk everyone around something much worse. Regular folk arent seeing vaccine time soon. Damn coronavirus chicken pox multiple times üôÉüôÉüôÉyay meüôÉüôÉüôÉ I‚Äôve recommended get shingles vaccine next year turn 35. anyone reading also got chicken pox multiple times, def talk doc it. won‚Äôt, he‚Äôll about-face vaccines soon leaves office cult eat like morons are. mean even gotten really cold yet. plus big holidays I'm assuming numbers going dwarf we've far. going anything it? Thank work! :D That's great magic, science, effort, compassion. gone, much control. let dog grow fat died heart disease 2 months ago. Thanks keeping us safe! pretty strong, concentrated spray. intensity levels higher ones really sting, guess like power washing bum. water kinda stays crack, gravity pulls gets everywhere, lift balls get slashed. far tp, dab wipe, disintegrate. dummy it‚Äôs clearly Uganda Technically 30k double blind trial 15k got vaccine, 15k got placebo clearly genetic issue scientists need identify. many instances families getting wrecked overall fatality rate 1% less. images could chosen...  caused divide even worse imagined. actually despise family friends may never talk again. $10 billion dollars, 1% F35 program's cost. thank u optimism ‚ù§Ô∏èbut think least million people vaccinated better idea things roll next months making sure. lot people put /s actually trying make point aren‚Äôt fully committed comment. 
/s sure cannot tell anyone, long term effects be. Pretty much way rural counties across US.  literally everyone team receive Nobel Prize? Even janitors helped clean labs? really wish better news, CEO saying likely June, actually optimistic timeline experts vaccine likely approved December, there's still mass production distribution. counting fact first doses reserved essential personnel, vulnerable populations, pretty unlikely Holy shit, AMAZING news! :D way stops people rise up. get accept.  ~ Scott Atlas


/$ Tbh, long time thought big Thanksgivings way them. bustling around one family‚Äôs dinner other. Then, years ago, husband one us one friend, perfect! could take easy day, watch wanted watch, indulge light day drinking, cook foods enjoyed, ton leftovers. Since then, we‚Äôve *only* done small Thanksgivings (like one two guests), really don‚Äôt feel like we‚Äôve missing anything. It‚Äôs really awesome whole day dedicated chilling, cooking food, eating food. note everyone side effects MUCH less severe covid usually pass within short period time. North Texas several friends. also know South Texas. You‚Äôre also missing part get back mostly normal earlier months you‚Äôve mentioned vaccinated everyone risk healthcare workers. That‚Äôs plan, everybody needs get vaccinated end this. fact, mainly UK (vaccinating groups mentioned)

Spring 2021 good timeline. That's LTS though. I'm pretty sure planning use dry ice boxes medium-sized distributions. Dry ice \~ -80C freezing like impossible. 


We'd really need logistics engineer give ""effect size"" relative cost burden either approach. Otherwise speculation. nope. soon get vaccinated I'm dropping percautions. Projecting going next million 3-4 days ""following trend"". That's point, look data, support assuming magically completely flattens

I say all. Notice said ""yet"" times mentioning daily case numbers. US almost definitely hit 200k/day, that's week away.

This sub rarely keeps feet ground making kind wild projections. 12 million 3-4 days time! 13 million 2 days that! 14 million 1 day! 15 million 30 seconds! 16 million -4 hours!

There's nothing would suggest 12 million mark would hit 3-4 days time, math work even remotely, pointed out. Firing wild projections blindly stupid.  supposed morse code? normal healthy concerns. also dont live past ""new"", live present day amazing advancement science &amp; technology. isnt first rodeo. vaccine worlds #1 priority thats getting fast. red tape bullshit. also getting faster covid rampant across world take long go testing phase isnt taking long see gets sick doesn't. 

Its ok nervous. Like said, totally normal healthy. takes lot time study behavior. many studies carried unregistered hours Belgium significant amount compared Germany Netherlands. Black women Trump Kryptonite. scared, although another test might smart.

You suffering basic human ignorance probability. worry, mean stupid - smart people do, even educated statistics struggle, focus closely.

In case, brain basically going okay, infectious disease, surely means 100% least close must get infected? actually, spousal infection rates around 20%, car sharing like 5%, forth. Think - people actually infecting anything 50% contacts infectious, talking tens millions cases, would spread billions already. math, amounts estimated cases quite consistent &lt;20% probabilities infection contact. R0, many people infected person infects, estimated maybe around 2 populations (with current behaviours). everyone infected everyone meet, R0 would maybe 7 10 something. way get current spreading speed average, people infect contacts. somewhat obscured superspreading, always &lt;20%, sometimes 0%, sometimes, 5%, sometimes 50%, still, rare four close contacts get it, spend fair amount time them, get it. tons people situation. 

Yes, could natural immunity, could crossimmunity another coronavirus, could undetected antibodies, absolutely likely explanation got lucky.  Blankets Less Blankets system government. Ten fold. nobody finds odd America pays countries health care widespread delusion root much covid spread. links literally prove wrong. again, care explain reach (incorrect) conclusion?  home. Wisconsin proof public working guess turkey? thinking morning...this basically means something like annual shot right? We'll take every year something like ""it eventually degraded cell"" really seen half people wearing mask?! work Sams club conservative state, seen uptake people wearing masks recently, still well 2% ask Chinese help? die saying crappy diet killed them, that's start Link? Yeah rate we‚Äôre going, new restrictions‚Ä¶
!remindme 2 weeks almost like need police reform -.--  .  ... article :
Leading virologists warned importance good planning inoculation program, saying could take 2022 vaccinate entire German population. Republican never pays debts people still support lockdown they're told need hunker 2 months live savings may since getting unemployment bonuses? good news mid Sept high 97K+.

But going relatives accounts, expect numbers rise soon. Plenty people shopping gathering holiday season masks social distancing( difficult anyway India) North South DeathQuota? way see lockdown. still leave house go work. dinner restaurant shopping want, even new restrictions recommendations. I‚Äôm going to, within rights. watch career great interest.  doubt refuse believe Belgium country likes find way regulations. Again, wanting go friends family human, belgian. People love throw around ""Belgen houden van achterdeurtjes"" without actual comparison proof. ""I bullied following reputable scientists."" MI Governor Gretchen Whitmer Jeff Bezos head looks like condom tip? Yeah, exposure infection. Young kids heavy transmitters, spoke would already happened anxiety, depression, along issues. pandemic made WAY socially distant previously. 

It help partner lives cause shes big help maintaining mental health whether realizes it.

Honestly anxiety caused buy truck mask replaceable filters way back February, things got bad here. previously taking public transportation started massive fits anxiety thinking bad gonna keep taking bus work.  Mental illness mean stupidity. counter argument would someone anxious staying home avoiding face face interactions manage control symptoms. Trump honestly. easy way criticize Trump hate him. People get sick people die still many people either believe COVID real think they'll get infected. Unfortunately can't fix stupid.  would want Christmas funeral immediate family? think I'm going do. I'm going come something allergy related think. Already starting lay groundwork complaining allergies. glorious Democratic Peoples Republic Korea!


All jokes aside, remote pacific nations probably good chance re-eliminating detect contain early. Covid ‚Äòfinally reaching‚Äô isn‚Äôt staying. Yeah that's happens people getting paid sit home. money time go shop, go home depot's build projects, etc... baby March start. won't. Prepare mentally. ton visitors actually nice. one allowed 2 weeks after. 8 months ago now. Barely remember. lot orders overturned court illegal powers people implemented stripped. 

Is moral police station enforce something believe immoral unconstitutional? 

Is ‚ÄúJust job‚Äù actual excuse use? History hasn‚Äôt looked kind excuse comes people undertaking unlawful orders government. Yeah think that's bit harsh man, fined something People skeered go hospitals. might get Rona.

/$ spread it. 

In Europe strong link starting school second wave coming 2-3 weeks later. There's much wrong post. Spousal attack rate around 20%, 99%. timeline exposure detectability wrong. multiple studies done since shown schools contribute community spread, study France initially suggested restricted Elementary age children, followed 9 cases, occurred time virus mitigation working community transmission rates low (more Covid community = school transmission, likely per many experts). You‚Äôre individual. It‚Äôs subjective still elections protests coming next I'm sure super spreader events. Car accidents exponential growth. COVID-19 does. remember children die, spread adults within building outside school, already Ugh believe that. probably think they're responsible too. FaceTime pretty good, it‚Äôs like 1918... I'm south, people planning normal holidays. think many companies going typical Christmas parties.


But older working people seemed change behavior much. see people 50's, 60's 70's acting normally. People clearly overweight, even obese. People who've heart attacks, diabetes, cancer survivors, kidney problems.


It's like 1600 Pennsylvania Ave, people showing up, trying act normal, maybe masks. business demands masks, many ignore demand, go elsewhere. Even means driving towns rules relaxed. inability sacrifice good community western civilization continue struggle virus eastern, inherently less selfish, either returning normal, normal months. misremembering, it‚Äôs true either haha. mean they‚Äôll probably figure get vaccines free eventually Regeneron? Nah Pay Absolute psychopath. Man, people love ""thinking children"" till deadly virus starts pandemic people claim effect children bad. Dolly Saint, Bill Gates microchip trying control world? harvest organs political prisoners dude lmao. Yes, government perfect take kidneys Hold behold - human specimen matters!

If OK, everybody MUST OK! There's gonna lot holiday burials arent there? Im staying home. Fuck going till shit control Seems pretty basic, got flu shot year slight headache, sore arm / injection sight. Minor body aches. better aboit day. fell love Mexican girl.  really. fucking reason people still get it, plot raises awareness better. complete utter *vexed bosom* mf trying spark civil war filing affidavit brain today infringing rights. expect accepted country really communist. Oh, man. say straight out. medical license suspended... Define ""good"". current vaccines corona tested long? Frustrating breakdown age, even clicking detailed data. mean schools? COVID spread schools reopened? somewhat cute crazy old lady way Republican governor women make realize right vote woman, want fuck her. Fortunately unfortunately Hillary... ""under fire"" ""fired""  science vaccine based on? I‚Äôve heard it‚Äôs works years one paid attention now. think anything original comment endorsed socialism. 

In fact, one even reference socialism you. better person letting die. explain deaths European countries US then? compare cases deaths per capita US much better Sorry, voted straight party ticket year vote pro-education, pro-social-services, pro-environment. research candidates local ballot, left one party pro-those-things, another party pro-conspiracy-theory anti-things-I-care-about, major 3rd party candidates align politically, smaller single-issue options running single-issues would prioritize. straight ticket was. least blind decision.

On hand, I'm pretty sure mixed political bag unaffiliated positions ballot. Since unaffiliated, may never really know. Dude. Humans killing treating neighbors‚Äô lives worthless since long occupied whole planet. 

Treating individuals precious relatively new (and good) thing. Fucking course one taking seriously. argue one reason public perhaps become apathetic towards media coverage virus become redundant often, alarmist.

Seems logical reason issue. Ahh, whoops - got family members mixed read comment. Reading comprehension low 2 AM, turns out. would run town? 

They carrying people represent. 

Republicans believe it‚Äôs government‚Äôs job save us. 

They want act. would run town want? 

She‚Äôll re-elected huge margin. issue!

It's hard schools find enough subs good year. subs sub right now. 

Anytime teacher exposed they're 2 weeks. everyone circle could cause school needing sub 2 weeks. 

Now add normal life. I've used 5x many days kid sick am. Winter? nothing lot subs building time. year! 3 subs!

Logistically thin ice. Even ignoring kids carry transmit it, ignoring fact teachers died, literally. There's flat logistical concern keeping things running enough adults rooms. 

I 2-3 kids week move person remote due exposure. 4 teachers right due exposure. dozens kids getting shitty fuck education capitalism says keep keeping on. Wow, guess I'm surprised upon investigation virus circulating much earlier detected, quite early, September 2019. interesting similar studies could done countries really trace origins understand natural reservoirs virus located. Guys stop testing. You‚Äôre making US look bad Pneumonia vax flu vax simultaneously absolutely demolished two days. I‚Äôd still take full fledged virus. Governor 50 million citizens goes party restaurant shutting simple peons. equal president golfing, significantly worse. clear, one spreads risk anyone, minimal spread minimal risk, therefore happy increase risk saying prepared others harmed

I find hilarious every one comments gets downvoted oblivion. 

A quick look posting history would tell I'm anything ready ""happily increase chance harm reason fear it."" mean Debbie Downer there's still lot unknowns vaccines effectiveness moment. know vaccines prevent asymptomatic infection, example. vaccines last long (we already many documented cases 2nd infection now).

Don't get wrong, they're big step right direction think best realistic. think know true efficacy least next summer. Pretty standard biotech stuff. topline data.  won't. like March, they're punting responsibility shutdowns states.

Sadly, Mitch probably actually thinks like But... Inviting people house social distancing.

I‚Äôm sick much anyone, miss friends/family, time invite people home go indoor gatherings. Go walk outside instead. Whitmer, Pelosi, AOC, Clinton, Warren - see pattern? Wonder studied booster shot needed long term repercussions different risking life risking lives others. least  scared June statement read article Moderna CEO said worst case scenario widely available June. worst case likely. even worst case many people receive then. vaccinate even 15% people (the vulnerable populations) death rate drop sharply. real bad 2 years ago, almost 3 weeks straight, off, 24/7, like really drunk point throwing combined world constantly spinning well sideways even eyes closed. absolute effort maintain basic biological functions. Horrible time life. 3000 series graphics cards new ryzen chips literally every single new electronic drops. retailers really fucking actual market sell scalpers go extra steps purchase items. verification human it.  article says 1 million diagnosed. many died? many millions got covid never got diagnosed? wife 71 years old told family yearly get together Thanksgiving. staying home year. would like able share many holidays together many years. trying keep entire family safe year. there's literally hundreds thousands excess deaths. Weird, almost there's new disease going around something. Thank participating vaccine development process. hope J&amp;J vaccine turns successful. would borderline case. me, I'd rather get tested positive could spread others. got shingles 29. fucking sucked knew nothing beforehand perceived affecting younger people. sure shit weakness kick balls, I'll disappointed I‚Äôm rush get this. They‚Äôve come way fast way conveniently Nice try. Better luck next time. Wellllll get worst cough Holidays. Soon hospitals beyond overwhelmed numbers multiple exponentially  difference human kind past human kind today. Previously upwards 98% population use agriculture. number dropped, utilize manpower science fix problems. name this, forget there‚Äôs essentially theory humans continue engineer way existential threats. 

Either way, phenomenal think corporations sales right now? joke? seen Amazon‚Äôs profits since start COVID?

Amazon doesn‚Äôt get taxed Trump gave president, national leadership anymore. Yes, let's say fuck Australia/NZ break rule probably get trouble generally consequences going way better China.


Actually think worse different SE Asian country. 


But either way want change conversation Australia New Zealand free countries. people probably exact freedoms US change wording laws. Aussies Kiwi's scream ""my freedom! Fuck mask"" instead hug loved ones next year due valuing lives self. Great example follow. 


I think take examples Winnie Pooh dictator trying commit genocide censoring anything like. States‚Äô Rights unless disagree States Like seat belts  took Tylenol first night fever never fever again. Can‚Äôt believe someone said ‚Äúwe rounding corner‚Äù weeks ago. awesome never said I'm fan fair actually seen anything say insolvent debt. 

He looks \~3 billion assets. 3b assets 4-500 million debt actually pretty underleveraged businesses go.

Ford 175 billion debt 260 billion assets. US population 330M CDC numbers quoting daily, need multiply 7 compare two. use right numbers, come same. say I'm going take it? taste loss mind fuck, got back June. could put hand sanitizer nose nothing. Oxford vaccine used meningitis vaccine placebo know side  Thank stars him. Part politician getting there, meeting people, listening them, begging help. So, sir count parking lot vaccine distribution?

Better yet, fix prices across industry can't go anywhere else! Mayor seems think otherwise Damn Rest Peace businesses there...why closing things without giving money?  anyone clarify something me. people care 40% take it? I'm sorry sounds barbaric honestly someone holding fucking idiot?

Would life return normal do? Would still allow concerts, gatherings etc occur plausible solution people simply ignoring will? one point would darwinism.. Even bubonic plague, pre antibiotics, unable that. Cheers! understand requirements work, yes disgust mostly federal government. California done well think must acknowledged since hasn‚Äôt anymore federal aid people, need take account amount people kneecapped financially. Newsom isn‚Äôt blame, even fraction soon ex-president cronies deserve.

In comment said favor locking compensated. Since situation president checked plus human turtle blocking help citizens, lot us work. problem.

Yes I‚Äôm thankful I‚Äôm California anti-mask moronic area seeing dire consequences actions, that‚Äôs part reason pay 3x costs live places. 

And I, along many others, gotta get bills paid somehow unfortunately. wrong think liberals states similar conservatives Canada? Like liberals Canada basically super liberals states. terms get tossed around frequently countries people assume countries. maybe I'm way off. think probably December-January darkest timeline. Things slowly kickstarting mid-late February. 100% normal, you‚Äôd get point. U.S. taxpayers get funds private investors would getting. thing want hear covid forever don‚Äôt ever go back work.  print boring reports numbers PDF, sometimes Excel. Also I've wasted months/years projects got cancelled shortly after.

I'm making difference, yay! know good republican may exist 4 years good republicans silent / drowned president 45 chants really damaged party.  


All think think Republicans Mitch 45  course encourages lot anger. Damn would that...people going go broke family think entire state soviet republic everyone ultra liberal San Francisco communist. arrested treason domestic terrorism. really believe outright conspiracy believers. there's another 50% total really easily manipulated go flow see others doing. 2 daughters health care . one front line covid care food service manager also front line. ""Rich person eats food rich establishment, equal President going golfing national crisis"" also people severe adverse effects idea true long term implications day? trump anything it!!! I've telling people ""Look, get together over.""It need holiday! Damnit, really? I've never picked that. internet president made sarcasm incomprehensible me. Would buy used disease 'man' ? know, joke. works around 12 people COVID every hospital US. looks like vaccine injuries occur body processing virus, body beginning affected soon vaccine administered. quick search seems though nearly traceable issues show within 48 hours, rest 42 days, 6 months year. looks like would know significant problems vaccines have. issues vaccines, COVID vaccines likely also fine. vaccine injury table compensation link found, I'm sure plenty resources explain things thoroughly. me, I'm 27, athletic build, healthy, comorbidities, etc. excellent chances COVID. *But there's still much higher chance death permanent damage get COVID get vaccine,* bet ass I'll getting vaccine soon can. also would prefer get unknowingly pass along someone vulnerable grocery store I'm asymptomatic. make choice whether first line, skepticism healthy, better eating indoor restaurants, indoor gatherings friends/family, risky behaviors meantime, people can't get vaccine lower priority list (or even can't afford it, US) job keep safe.

Hope helps! search later better sources confirm retract comment, get back work lol know huge trial los angeles moderna vaccine- participants say super hopeful don‚Äôt want pandemic end, must benefiting way. wife pregnant, family get us attending holidays year. Well Rest Peace businesses mention children gonna passing virus to. country full fucking morons? He‚Äôs got round golf play first. Why? option could likely diagnose 18% population mental illness, without pre-existing disease. Nur die beste qualit√§t. victim attempted kidnapping.

Your username reference Jews controlling world.

Heads up: Jews control world, control thoughts.

Ya little twerp. Ouch, title.

Jokes though. always hated Thanksgiving. like Christmas except presents awkward, cram travel right time everyone else. That's point. Tegnellists said *lockdowns work*. half year. Obviously do. Lockdowns work less ""recommendations"". work better. Sweden ""recommends"" lockdown behaviors. Why? thought lockdowns work. ""recommend"" people isolate then.  state next? r/agedlikemilk :( saying beginning. sooo convenient claim allowed... lot myths gender politics. Women keep telling us judged harsher men assertive, feel pressure agreeable, etc. none stands real-world scrutiny. 

Here gender-swapped recreation Hillary Clinton/Donald Trump debate recreated gesture gesture, word word, tone tone. interesting think is, hyper-assertive, hyper-disagreeable female Trump actually likeable real-world male Trump.

The male Clinton less likeable real-world female Hillary Clinton.

Women lot leeway claim. lot deal anti-covid anti-mask people heard (but actual research) symptom one experiences drug trial listed side effect even actual evidence link shot, drug, etc. itself. 

If ate Taco Bell got shot got shits, they‚Äôd list it. So, there‚Äôs that. Mouthwash antibacterial, antiviral. Tread carefully here. bad making running blitz public service announcements wearing masks. She'd actually reach demographic needs hear it.

Don't get wrong, think amazing woman who's done lot good. wish celebrities caliber would outreach counter Trump's insanity. Damn communist countries South Korea Japan uptick 220 daily cases treat like crisis. Fewer 500 total deaths since pandemic began. country 52 million, half metro region single city.

It really puts numbers United States shame. know personally case, people arenot getting properly checked sent home covid ""take paracetamol come back worse"" weirdo wearing mask. Look mirror tell look normal. Compare image mirror high school graduation picture....maybe mask works consider appearance..I find uglier person is..more likely love masks .  Noem bad crazy eyes cut member way Trump: ""can inject it""? law using limit public gatherings 8,an amendment made mars ordningslagen(public ordinance law), also applies protests. theory gather 8 people protest right now. reality probably want amendment legally tested therefor let protests slide. Holy fear mongering. Yes, much better example. Thanks Yeah. I‚Äôve go dentist couple times fillings recently. EVERYONE comes wash hands 30 seconds mouthwash regardless procedure done.  fast food chain roommate works ended covid benefits... literally days another confirmed case. necessarily, mRNA get degraded, interestingly enough, mRNA actually give immunity. immunity comes immune system like vaccine.

The point mRNA force cells around injection site start producing (In case Moderna's vaccine) spike protein that's found surface Covid. 

Those spike proteins (which harmless own) eventually make way bloodstream, immune system detect mount immune response. immune system defeated intruder (harmless spike proteins case), keep memory defeat proteins. 

That's considered immunised Covid ever enters bloodstream, immune system recognise spike proteins defeat virus extremely quickly. 

However mean immunity lifelong either, depending certain factors (like type strength immune response generated) could yearly lifelong immunity. simply fact mRNA-based make temporary vaccine type. cannot keep discussion every day thinking along lines movies something bad starts harming everyone, slowly people left behind keep ignoring it, act like nothings wrong. There's people recognize danger, everyone else responds monotone everything fine.  keep seeing sentiment, dangerous spread idea. office limiting tests-only symptomatic people known positive contacts. We're running tests, irresponsible encourage people use resource selfish reasons.

You can't make old friends. -.-- . ... -. .----. - Question get vaccine trial it‚Äôs placebo.... eligible get real deal trial over? using amendment ordningslag(public ordinance act) mars would apply epidemics.

Hope they‚Äôre happy ones actually attended now, feels bad people indirectly got selfishness. Lol dont know side effects vaccine either. please first ill right behind risk people get poor fellow seems blame world's ills - cancer civic decay - capitalism.

But right. Maybe favoured political-economic model actually feudalism.  Oh believe me, us giving every bit much attention March-April(good bad).

Luckily live pretty secluded place ‚Äúgo town‚Äù often man, worry lot. keep looking makes sense - replied comment, ""Hopefully next 50 ears US step 20th century"".

I thinking yeah, maybe US make step 20th century, 21st century. actually arrived ie Hell yeah let‚Äôs go! one main reasons could never doctor...besides obvious intelligence issues.

I would close patient log ask someone else fill bed. Someone actually wants get better. deleted comment say üò±? social distancing always alternative real life. Could order mask wearing situations keeping safe distance impossible, then?

The rules Oslo based assumption. Wear masks indoors (stores etc) public transport situations keeping meter distance possible. can't really know advance packed bus store there, many people simply decide wear mask get in. there's taxis, always impossible maintain kind distance. information bring people say positive rate skewed high false positives. usually brought due Elon Musk's tweet 4 tests two positives two false results. Without getting math conversation easy explain/show amount false positives significant hospitalization rates deaths going rate. Smoking alcohol consumption leading causes mouth throat cancer. Chances increase dramatically both. you‚Äôre saying inject mouthwash cure? Ok got it. mean yeah. still human man. can‚Äôt treat somebody like less they‚Äôre stupid. Useless; unless actually enforce mask mandates. Well, yeah. Anyone attacked papers twitter, regardless validity. 

This surprising all. Silly decisions political leaders instead science leaders. Merkel background science. knows comes next. theory might good studying years archieving titles something personality makes stubborn admitting mistakes. far, seen admitting mistake even once. 

The worst part mistakes costing human lives, simple mistakes. 

Even right pushing Sweden enforce masks since almost whole entire world following path except Sweden.

As far remember, Sweden company countries using mask. none countries Western countries. Right? new restrictions half strict ones spring everyone still freaking can't go Bob Evans church weeks..oh nooo Capitalism teaches individual community money people whereas communism teaches community individual. go one, regret five minutes in, wishing stayed comfort home, yet stay hours, feeling miserable, can't find way leave early without awkward.

Does sound right? Aww... reading skills aint scratch either. 

Personally, I'm loving watch thrash around quote numbers. real treat. I‚Äôve noticed pattern. I‚Äôm wondering though - back spring promised unlike neighbours would protected herd immunity autumn/winter economy would better. 

None promises materialised. 

In two weeks we‚Äôll reach April‚Äôs peak level regarding hospitalised cases - according Jan Albert. still two weeks measures announced yesterday show it‚Äôs effect. 

Last time authorities blamed failure ‚Äùbad luck‚Äù supposedly gave us much larger initial spread neighbours. excuse cannot used anymore. It‚Äôs also becoming harder harder claim masks effect closing schools effect mass testing useless. international scientific evidence becoming overwhelming.  


Therefore doubt Swedish population supportive happens second time. think doesnt understand science is. read comments, see careful choice words. aware ""the truth"" ""scientific knowledge"" conflated, said truth knowledge.

To truth defined conforms reality. sense methodological naturalist (in opposition philosophical naturalist).

I stand said, science building models, ""the truth"". Models representations world specific caracteristics including: falsifiable. deny existence scientific knowledge.

My entire comment fact since science make declarations truth, varying degrees quality evidence one ""certain"" accordance evidence, mandatory vaccination (but pro vaccine).

In regards strawmen homeopathy, nothing said. Every claim burden proof. claim pseudoscience factual experience. conflate skepticism understanding scientific method anti-science. fact, believe currently valid method investigating natural world.

I know deserve much credit *are* good falling line following orders. tired politicians complete garbage excuses human beings.

It's fundamental flaw politics, people want help world go professions science, healthcare humanitarian efforts. people politics want power rule almost anything get power, that's ""end game"" profession. Politicians charge anything failed politicians. Nasal/mouth wash proven studies decrease infection probability exposure respiratory viruses health workers.

The protection also lingers hour wash, use before. Yup state fucked, stocked drugs, emerging January 21 Well reply stating Sarah Palin original apparently Automoderator big fan vapid moron Wasilla removed statement.  That‚Äôs meant. many folks straight party ticket without research. 

I live GOP heavy town normally bad. disagree even slightly hell breaks lose.  goes Dem opposition here. middle road balanced position gets nowhere. It‚Äôs sad. personally teach 4 kids who've infection. personally know two teachers infection last month. One led high school closed 2 weeks. 

You know whether exposure caused infection. regardless, change logistics. Needing 15 subs exposure futile needing 15 subs infection. Damn right, Dolly's saint.\*

&amp;#x200B;

\*And even like country music. forgive please, 20th century 21st century!

I'm sorry, missing word something here? make sense. I‚Äôm New Orleans, live S.E. Asia now. attest this. Incivility? fuck uncivil towards? former Governor Alaska VP candidate? Pretty sure shes going survive Wasilla ... someone already lost parent Christmas, let tell you, kind ruins holiday forever. ...and proves conclusion wrong. I‚Äôd take advice. immediate family decided yesterday cancel Thanksgiving year. sucks favorite holiday, worth risk. We've managed stay safe far, worth it. Wish people would realize that, too. risk making last Thanksgiving ever? Give one example Constitution violated, clause quoted sourced. Even something there, it‚Äôs like 250 year old document held moral practical times. think takeaway. voter suppression efforts Texas egregious ever heard life. Dumpster fires bodies.

It‚Äôs going happen. point many, everything else overwhelmed many infrastructure workers sick time, dumpster cremations thing. 

The dumpsters decorated too; pictures departed, painted, really personalized. 

When survivors future refers 2020 dumpster fire, imagery comes mind. I'm disappointed people year, knew good degree faults, including myself, ridiculous. 8 months passed, know anything long-term effects, concerning reports front. seem studies that, nothing, even relevant. 

Everybody talking reinfections day night, time nobody bothers enter positives database report them. need anything special that, couple people typing entries. it. 55+ million confirmed cases proper follow-up studies surveys. 

If lucky, small group smart skillful people provide us vaccine, bail us billions useless idiots out. mean bill gates made fortune ruthless dolly made entertaining people. easier question motives. said, people think gates microchipping people idiots. timeline I've heard 20 million vaccinated Decemeber, 25 million subsequent month. Summer possible half us. assume built electric heater. Pretty much one hot water piped toilet, bidet requires plumber rip open wall popular. Good read
TY U posting RemindMe! 1 Apr 2021 Cheers. Hopefully get back normal see loved ones soon. Evidently. 

Trump came terrible ""plan"" he's busy pitying change. ever heard term, philanthropy. Perhaps Warren Buffetts ""Giving Pledge"" partnership Bill Melinda Gate's foundation? like, closed subsidised infection rates go open makes sense... (comment aimed you, understand control infections disease curbs demand except basics).   


Good luck, man, hope things get better. Danish ""experts"" thankfully got ran goverment actually dared act. *wish* Swedens goverment would done same.

Both ""public health agencies"" full total nutjobs. Idk seems huge problem scandinavian health agencies is. Yup sympathy gotta smarter virus. Keep fluids up, get decent sleep, don‚Äôt let get run down, take vitamin C, D3, zinc. Plenty people sub saying want first take without knowing long term effects. think people took fucking smallpox vaccine kind worries? No, survive. people need remember risk worst vaccine side effects remarkably small compared risk Covid. thing though, reading press release actual order. 

If cannot even read without ‚Äúwell can‚Äôt take literally‚Äù imagine actual law is. Yes seem affect people certain blood protein issues anemia, diabetes, AIDS, rare blood borne diseases, sickle cell 

Was wondering something scientist looked into

Transmission isn‚Äôt blood blood enters stream how

Just wondering I‚Äôm Covid restrictions that‚Äôs tad scary forced see family friends. Yeah world's shitty place right now. agree free. find good one gotta stick it! Interestingly, local health department revealed recent drive flu vaccine clinics also designed mass vaccination exercise eventual COVID vaccine. However, live decently populated suburban county... Also, Federal Govt: Dont listen governors!

omg everything unfair Trump! certainly eloquent way say it. :D 

I thought poster responded aware mortality rate differences. family colds. vague cold-like symptoms wouldn‚Äôt really noticed hadn‚Äôt sick. 

And I‚Äôd trying lose weight thought sucking really weight loss hiding fluid build heart failure. Yeah I'd love see parents too. ya know people can't afford shit see anyone dont job anymore. I'm thinking people. That's free everyone. RemindMe! 150 days There's also many shots available yet, either first 2 wait 2022 vaccinate majority people first world countries think. least one Corona Mary come work. seemed proud too. Went damn store. think management threw either. I'm sure tons more. Really think there's going baby boom 2022. know first thing I'm downloading bunch different dating apps going lot social activities people talk to. lonely year. Biggest questions have:

What percentage infected people recover get reinfected Covid regardless strain?

 
What percentage infected people asymptomatic?

 
How long recovered person stay immune for?  husband contacting family tomorrow let know Thanksgiving year instead celebrate home.

I see announcement going well either, think MIL going pretty upset. cleaning, root canal crowning scheduled. I'm surging area, resigned fact get done luxury quarantining alone Christmas. rather spread family. Suppose could forgo crowning last thing want need emergency dental treatment.

I say...it feels really fucking weird wearing mask public. Can't imagine actual dentists feel constantly around people without masks. vaccines able intended impact innate immune system. Consequently, next new bug comes along, vaccine worthless new bug cost us lives $trillions. **NOTHING** make healthier. vaccines save lives, time. Next time worthless. tool useful, assumes gathering least 10 people Covid even spread population, effect different levels pre-isolation, voluntary mask wearing, etc.

My Thanksgiving going immediate family, technically 4 bubbles people go ever one two weeks food. I'm still anxious, we're going safe. RemindMe! 14 Jan 2021 They've already shown they'll refuse mandates cops enforce also pro-coronavirus. Swedish law isnt working.

I mean fuck let Norway, Denmark Finland take over. country fails protect population right intervene. pressure really intense Labor bureau forcasts job growth nurses Fuck that. I'd pay lot able visit grandma again. I'm sure many feel similarly. happen got real sick way younger, also could smell vinegar vinegar months months woke one day back normal get lockdowns suck, everyone make massive fuss it? idea save lives, control yours. People paranoid smh. Chill. literally 2 vaccines standby People spewing coronaviruses every year. common cold coronavirus. Yet, one gave shit elderly dying till 2020 till politically motivated.

95% flu deaths missing... odd They've slow past lot timely fairly line countries. I'm expert here, but, pfizer looked moderna think ""shit, temperature thing way better, maybe tweak ours?"". capitalism competition meant shared much products? vaccines feel way. really great friends! mention candidates reporting back soon!

Saw interview government official today projects 20 million doses December, 25 million month after. Looks like we're within year thing behind us. Maybe even sooner lot us. large gatherings next Fall seems entirely possible. Going person shopping waste time. Seriously, look forward t9 day retail stores become thing past. .. hardly anyone gives crap thing anymore. talking lockdowns... get ready big time riots. location Pfizer Moderna trials take place? subjects taken randomly across US? wondering -- 30,000-ish people vaccine nice think wonder many people saved already. Wonder regions people running around in... find good info regarding positivity rate day countries like Italy/France? I'm interested comparing march october kinda hated people before, it‚Äôs burning hatred like vaccines also generally unlimited resources available development. one did. basement Comet Ping Pong Thanks rural folks traveling pandemic well, top wearing masks social distancing. ""Sat WW2"".. lol. perhaps forget entire war pacific region japan beaches Normandy? look bright side

Multinational corporations billionaires got extra taxpayer subsidies Masks mandatory work here. wear one stores avoiding crowds bars. Charity donation actually due increased standard deduction SALT cap causing fewer people itemize almost exactly 24 hrs injection. fever, chills, body aches. Woke Monday feeling great. Canada Thanksgiving. Cases dramatically increased 4 weeks later. I'm pretty sure exemption minor children ""When man knows hanged fortnight, concentrates mind wonderfully."" would definitely appreciate someone wearing one though felt sick still needed public. 

It definitely won‚Äôt like widespread thing people wear masks time, everywhere. cough maybe fever whatever I‚Äôll probably throw mask work post pandemic. SIKKKEEEE Beware vogmask fraudulently marketed NIOSH-approved N95 respirator, company specifically called NIOSH dangerous marketing. vogmask _not_ provide similar protection N95 respirator. fooled false sense security using much money life worth, would say? give ballpark estimate.

They severe PPE shortages, reusing masks designed one use. states allowing covid positive staff work alongside healthy staff. dangerous conditions taken lives many young healthy healthcare professionals.

Capitalism going fix jack shit. mean, yeah, let's pay more, I'm that. going solution. Flattening curve solution, capitalism standing square way seems. someone dealt 4 months potential lung damage (I lost job insurance knows what's really wrong), load heck vax. lol.

Wow, serious revisionist history worked lab cool stuff liquid helium temp (4K) lunch, coldest cryostat goes 50mK (yeah thats right, 0.05deg C absolute zero), I'd say 'deep' cryogenic :p mildly cryogenic, even cryogenic. even liquid nitrogen temperature.. :p jail American rapper harrassed thugs?  Interesting... published research this? Speak whole world America alone ignorant idiot sure, could get put 12 month waitlist easier distribute vaccine, could buy Pfizer vaccine now. choice brainer.

The Oxford vaccine already began production 30 million doses Australia last week, licence Oxford-Astrazeneca. gamble vaccine effective begin distribution soon receives approval. dont know entirely when, Pfizer Moderna seem poised ask EUA sometime week within take another weeks review.

Generally estimate mid December early Jan one start get distributed frontline health workers risk vaccines produced month start distributing general population sometime April June article linking quoting upcoming book, wich already critizised taking quotes context make conclusion.

The book mentions mail conversation Tegnell retired infection control physician. argued 3 strategies:

1: Local lockdown 4 weeks.

2: Test trace

3: Slow fast spread hypothetical herd immunity.

Tegnell answered [since already large community spread parts country can't test enough] go option 3. 
But ofcourse author ommited bracketed part. us florida insane holed houses rarely see us emerge... take heart -- we're terrible here. positivity rate 5%

gulp. weekend rate 40% rate mean? 4k 10k tests. workdays get something like 30$ lower, 35k tests don‚Äôt believe it. vaccine announcements pharama companies Olly helps getting share values high. know vaccines won‚Äôt common man 2022 least. Till start cautious depends contagious virus is. Measles pretty much contagious disease that's - infected person likely infect 12-18 people population without immunity, lot Covid.  That's interesting, aware Japanese government tightly controlling media outlets there. Would say due political pressure Olympics 2021?

Is correct, given information work healthcare, situation magnitudes worse what's reported? friends keeps talking excess deaths, I'm intrigued. 

On another note, field hospitals built UK, news. Daily updates progress. get impression UK government saying ""if China build field hospital 2 weeks, we!"" Ditch diggers get. Someone bury others. Socially distance need do.  Bleach kill cancer cells time. mean practical application medicine... covid cancelled? Source? well said.

Safety officers who‚Äôs safety isn‚Äôt high priority safety work perform ultimate demise EU, poorer countries trying extort money richer countries fed hand-outs.  
 
These first cracks facade, people richer countries started feel less supportive huge bail-outs 2008 - bailouts ('loans') conditions never met. Random example, Netherlands 'loaned' Greece 18 billion Euro - nobody ever really expected see one cent coming back that. 
 
It's richer countries want help poorer countries, richer countries expect countries reasonably meet societal standards deem fitting EU. Thankfully socialism stuck sensible science like guess mean area outbreaks much tied demographics going full force extra curricular sports hosting social parties.  even organizing underground homecomings hundreds kids.  parents would flipping everyone threatened kids.  


We think, well old people good life well unhealthy people, could heathy careful.  Therefore wont even take minor steps sacrifices make things safer vulnerable pandemic. found article -- South Dakota. course No, still know many vaccines approved many manufactured sure. 

We also still waiting detailed data around Pfizer Moderna, expert information coming weeks front. sneeze droplets coming mouth might help mouth covid-free.

with said, replacement mask wearing lockdowns hope people try use mouthwash go maskless thinking can't spread it. understand viruses work? preliminary results show second jab side effects first. personal experience? come longer/slimmer hose suppose get connected either dual valve angle stop ‚Äúy‚Äù connection coming hot water sink. Doesn‚Äôt require much plumbing work all. really need wrench/channel locks, Teflon tape, maybe new dual valved angle stop. STOP COUNT!

COUNT VOTE! proceed, following:


the ability learn: feel describing concept unnecessary, need to, let know



self awareness-example: lets say get hungry, aware got hungry? aware thought process like got hungry? aware actions taking?


the ability reason: simple logic really, concepts considered fixed (like ALIVE)


the ability best: lets say thought brushing teeth comes up, without questioning it, argue alternatives (like saying brush extra well tomorrow) matters reason every thought end (with logic, done forming opinion, saying later, asking matter, etc) countries drop testing weekend, thats week week growth also considered analysing cade numbers(and positivity rate). case lowest 2 month weekly fluctuations dont matter. right on. people zero problems giving freedoms safety, living society. give freedoms get murdered random person sunglasses, safety, give freedom murder anyone. world dangerous default, agree kill other, freedom safety,

a person ability extend another person, wearing mask safety, purely suffering antisocial personality disorder. Like talk nephews South Park.

I still can't understand know it, they're 19 21! mRNA vaccines BioNTech Moderna we've recently seen good results using new technology allows developed much rapidly existing vaccines. making modification would relatively quick. bigger question regulators would handle this. require full 3 trial phases run again, there's still considerable delay time spent trialing vaccine.

Note vaccines target part virus responsible entry cells part susceptible mutation easy mutate something completely unviable. remain less way virus work. expected vaccines rather robust possible mutations. *4. Gasoline fight
5.  Blow said gasoline fight That‚Äôs great. Hopefully majority like individuals following directions well. small dinner.

I'd rather stay home, one holiday wife cares about. I've seen June. Huh? talking lol? Nobody stopping drive church services. Yes, are. Horribleüò§ Let's hope so.  fucking political. That's name healthcare system. AI needs tweaked. Eli Lilly monoclonal antibody -- enough supply likely restricted pre-existing conditions. said, live smaller city, say population 10,000...the hospital might even see drugs first couple months shipped out? guess would send cities first? things work?  Question USA: given amount people uncomfortable taking vaccine (IIRC half) it‚Äôs first released, due sentiments ‚Äúrushed‚Äù, still good shot ending pandemic time soon? well, Im talking cases area linked halloween parties. Sometimes crazy ex downvoted voot. Yeah given 20% people struggle mental health issues begin I‚Äôm exactly surprised.

If quarantine room two weeks there‚Äôs solid chance I‚Äôd end in-patient end it‚Äôs harder breathe, yes Pulling brake right go side cliff little late. never left first wave.  pisses end. people selfish? He‚Äôs crypt keeper guy let 250k Americans die congratulating fantastic leadership. many politicians tested positive far?


And seem like ones keep testing positive way? fools never see masks, socially distancing. Yeah, seems real someone next dies prolonged painful death. One thing, know kind sociologist ethnologist, assume not. possible good point others hearing, others likely perspective considered. 

As Asian American, question assertion Japanese Chinese ethnically culturally dissimilar. truth nuanced counts. There's Japanese indigenous people whose genes likely make significant percentage average Japanese person. And, Japanese culture distinct influenced Chinese (and vice versa). guess saying believe scientists? Love that‚Äôs type argument get. Well, Spanish Flu probably came 'Merica. Yeah ‚Äúhave dinner family you‚Äôll die 30 days later‚Äù accurate information fear mongering all. mentioned patients would rather believe lung cancer covid is... unfathomable February March going worst months record deaths. entire civilization slaves corporate greed consumerism.

OK, later, plenty people need appreciate help. wasting one second you. hospital staff.  That's mean... dropped quickly. There's plenty covid-waves look around world examples, including one France march. never see drastic drop short timeline. Also, need say this, real lockdown. people obeying rules all, properly enforced. matter, viruses care borders. *moonwalks patients' rooms  won't, religion, rational belief. work tech. woman could start office fire everyone would look way. ?

I mind restrictions really. consistent.  can't close church leave liquor store open.

You can't say cancer screenings treatments essential abortion clinics are.... MIL side family Thanksgiving like normal, guilt-tripping husband *hard* we‚Äôre refusing go due COVID. *not* going. 

What gets politicized COVID is, entire side family lifelong, die-hard Democrats, *still* don‚Äôt care COVID! Oh, *and* multiple nurses doctor, among them! can‚Äôt, people! Still better europe. reaction. like January/Valentine‚Äôs Day funerals. Xmas close thanksgiving. Tough 30 people Skype. messed UI UX. I'd like know too. many Stay Behind vs Left Behind.

When Inconvenient Truth [2006] Tampa FL theaters, BIL said maybe dozen people watching. Whereas city lines around block. asked BIL ""Why? people care?"" guessed anyone cared already left Florida. (He left later, could.) cousin baby shower earlier month. supposed one ""drive by"" ones. family pulled masks everyone inside wearing masks. stayed outside wearing masks uncle came mocked us saying looked scared. cousin husband came wearing masks! due December worry hospital space baby. think statement sounds threatening...  ""did nothing"" false, makes sense say ""didn't enough"". Honestly that's think it. Less strangers getting sick bonus, primary mission.  production   AOL Instant Messenger people elected love it. 

Whatever think politicians, whether think they've manipulated media make people feel way: reason politicians following strategy constituents feel reassured, stronger, superior result rather pandemic strategy driven public health scientists. 

Yes, politicians know better: ultimately, act way, there's every chance would backlash someone genuinely ignorant would elected local national level. people ignoring public health officials spreading around virus ignorance fined. fixed you. Wow... she‚Äôs amazing recently  *patriotic choking noises* General question, caused Skype loose popularity Zoom succeed pandemic? Skype totally drop ball?

Yeah really sucks. originally MS father 71 years old told coming Thanksgiving month ago. could tell really bothered see point traveling putting others risk. really hate know get spend many w bc age would rather one last either. Let's keep fingers crossed vaccine winner!!!! Look happened Illinois! basically reporting summer florida numbers &amp; think it‚Äôs it‚Äôs cold af No, big too. idiots learn words experiences convince narrative they've subscribed whole-heartedly false. They're good dead best thing rest us protect loved ones wait deniers die off.  New thanksgiving idea, change date vaccine everyone. That's reason celebrate say. quarantining 2 weeks visiting parents 2 hour drive away also strictly quarantining. one else present. routine labor day. think possible see family actually careful it.

I‚Äôm relatively high mask distancing compliance area that‚Äôs expecting small spike.

Question people low compliance areas experiencing spikes, people started complying? seen change behavior hospitalizations gone up? Yep it‚Äôs called Bystander Effect. 

Best way prevent avoid using generic ‚ÄúSomeone go get help!‚Äù messages. 

Rather, say ‚Äúyou red shirt, call 911!‚Äù you‚Äôre telling individual people help. mind growing much, since parents house everyone came travel.  Dolly Parton mother Teresa supposed be? Maaaaan.... shits gonna start over. Friends family! Anybody haven‚Äôt quarantined last two weeks Thanksgiving together.

I always cook meal 26 people - friends family. None invited year. Mom 85 expose that! Amazing.

like said rumor monginger. look people swear got flu flu shot commont get symptoms similar flu day two after. also takes weeks take effect like senaior arrived already infected get shot. millions getting vaccinated year odds coincidentilay get flu within days shot refuse ever get even tho killed virus can't give flu. stimulates immune system similar way may feel nothing much like crud day two. I've got pots get laid low days yet happy knowing means immune system gearing protect real virus would lay weeks.

I'm Oregon, bright spot pandemic recently. see difference stay home order closing non-essential. Stay home order still get groceries such.  won‚Äôt, though. Go look Twitter feed. Insanity. 

@govkristinoem Ah, arguments left, resulting ad hominem. Well done!

So you‚Äôre saying it‚Äôs Sweden‚Äôs fault rest Europe badly? Interesting... Jesus, spot-on. alternate version weld, saw China. turns people can't trusted, measures drastic all. welding (calm down, half-joking. Yes, yes, videos actually welding people inside) I'd personally tempted say ""oh mistake. obviously fine. Time go home."" another patient treated.  I'm aware. know reaching conclusion think bad thing. think lot cross disciplinary scientific collaboration would lead amazing discoveries. exact boat you. Nice come across also since start time time here.

I watched early videos Wuhan Jan WeChat knew trouble. lead searching around finding sub change China flu sub.

I loaded early Feb well. Got involved several things, built network contacts many hospitals, doctors, joined groups researchers epidemiologists fly wall, read everything could find pandemics history them, etc. easily spent 10+ hours day learning months months. doubt countless days 20+ hours reading, researching, learning.

I asked recent Sunday I‚Äôve spent much time energy learning could virus, pandemics, etc. (I backed summer fall, kept headlines, back all-in.) couldn‚Äôt answer question. idea. feel need well educated this.

Around March felt like living alternate universe. (I still do.) knew coming like knew name. Yet, everyone continued living like nothing happening. drove crazy. hard time one would listen me. Lost several friendships. Lost interest vast majority people hanging prior side, either don‚Äôt care think it‚Äôs nothing worry about. 

And feel all... since beginning. That‚Äôs toughest - especially knowing year coming winter. feel couldn‚Äôt wrap minds around magnitude fell BS Gov media. yes, much BS. Lies. Smoke mirrors. Psychological warfare. Manufactured campaigns spread confusion. maddening see it. Ugh. I‚Äôm sure relate.

Because virus, I‚Äôm also sure many quite understand economic impacts could 2021 beyond. serious restrictions states serious stimulus put place soon, well, that‚Äôs whole different topic.

Anyway, write many books this. Sorry.

Keep you‚Äôre stay safe. Hopefully many page. Upcoming pandemic movies crazy Forget ""village idiots"", antimaskers covid deniers stripped human rights treated cockroaches mosquitoes clarify, cognitive dissonance *good* thing. discomfort resulting contradictory beliefs. 

The way people resolve cognitive dissonance bad good. Nice incitement violence buddy Thats great ideal hopefully theyll Walmart's, Kmart's, CVS Walgreens health agency's USA water computed higher probability survival?  healthcare professionals across country approaching similar conundrum. to, soon to, ration care provided. degradation healthcare quality, finite amount recourses, 

This called triage... reason train fun colored badges mas casualty incidents. Red, blue, black colors want. situations get cursory look medic maybe RN. color fate decided then. That's it, next. two years left high school, it‚Äôs gonna college hell. someone explain Neanderthal like me, vaccines made effective, virus constantly changing every country basically mutation covid? Don‚Äôt ya love getting lumped together idiots? 

People live country *very* different, don‚Äôt know needs pointed absolutely anger everyone. also outrage general public shit happens time, even without pandemic. Healthcare business. notorious bare minimum comes actually caring patients. Fuck politicians think know doctors. fuck profit healthcare country. hear that. live CA love it, weather, outdoors year round, beaches, national parks-Yosemite highlight, Bay Area high paying jobs, culture, food. I‚Äôve lived traveled outside CA returned Bay Area. 

It‚Äôs perfect yes problems overall quality life excellent. Reddit: Listen doctors. Also, Reddit: listen doctors! Many Japanese gargle mouthwash come home work. It‚Äôs good health habit. wonder many suriving dr nurses healthcare workers want stay rual areas willing risk lives prove political point, often denying existance thing maiming maybe killing - maiming killing healthcare providers psychologically scarring survivors. knw hurts think people give shit actions kill must much worse trying save people, busting behind putting harms way sake thrown face. take full responsibility, China's fault.

Probably one stupidest things president said country anywhere. ^American way always run fire people county regardless got there. 

I got man everyone else.

I love guys. agree. also exacerbates seeds racism, often sense fear unknown first. Trump GOP weaves tales white culture genocide victimhood well makes easy people fall it. say people responsible behavior. it‚Äôs permission, it‚Äôs well oiled machine exploit seeds anger hatred. bright side, COVID deniers would never win election occurred. hope right point idk. I'm exhausted trying reason people. wife's family still thinks real hospitals really packed. Insanity. transit admin usually big pandering politicians sure specific one doh. rather throw employe bus stand assholes. one reason unions strong still place.

 pretty dumb let people mask ride transit doh lost confidence rest user base going make lose way users. I'm similar situation. Anyone wanna help give advice? 

My Thanksgiving going 4 people. Me, aunt, uncle, cousin. 

I've keeping months, live away, mind myself, work home. 

My cousin two roommates says pretty strictly careful, one got back spending two days parents' house. cousin ""quarantining"" two weeks (by thanksgiving), could go. Also works home. 

My aunt elementary school teacher, allow students, still goes ~3 days per week whatever, teachers building masked up/ apparently pretty cautious. 

And uncle works home. 


Just based information, would feel safe going house Thanksgiving, possibly staying couple days, me? They're gonna wearing masks, we're gonna inside whole time/eating/drinking etc. 

I know safe idea. aunt uncle pretty immunocompromised, they're careful (thanksgiving included), I'm still sort concerned, us. sound generally low-risk? High risk? 

We live north NJ. kids schools open two months now, modifications. outbreaks. Schools problem. Hmmmmmmm,Lets see far Rhode Island NYC? Yeah Texas blowing up. hospital wife giving birth COVID tents set outside hospitals capacity. stupid. Like nut up, shut down, let's give hospitals fighting chance. Hey friend, I‚Äôm saying I‚Äôve there. first time suicidal 14. (I‚Äôm 26 now) I‚Äôm living proof gets better. know you‚Äôve probably heard million times it‚Äôs pretty cliche sometimes makes want pull hair out, get better. keep going find new things bring light life. me, it‚Äôs stories, live music, relationships. don‚Äôt know you, you‚Äôll find haven‚Äôt already. 

And also know mean sense like don‚Äôt want go back dark place were, don‚Äôt know you‚Äôll able get again. one best years life 2019 really took mental health seriously started go therapy take meds (for ADHD anxiety). came crashing lockdowns pandemic. thought progress made gone forever, made feel even hopeless was. Like, one worst points it‚Äôs years. turned knew get back it. It‚Äôs like riding bike skill. again. you‚Äôre able pull darkest times, gives new perspective good times. makes even better precious.

For me, really miss live music. didn‚Äôt realize important couldn‚Äôt experience anymore. I‚Äôm like you, zoom calls aren‚Äôt gonna cut reuniting people. live streams old music festivals isn‚Äôt good enough either. that‚Äôs okay. imagine first time pandemic I‚Äôll get experience again. Hopefully it‚Äôs outside, I‚Äôm standing boyfriend friends, masks, worry catching covid, drinking laughing, artist waiting comes stage. It‚Äôs going magical moment, wouldn‚Äôt miss anything. know probably something like can‚Äôt wait again. don‚Äôt want miss might cry beautiful be. 

And record, ever therapist tries talk feelings, they‚Äôre good job. therapist taught lean feelings actually feel rather run away. doesn‚Äôt mean destructive. sitting emotions processing helped much. Sometimes it‚Äôs hard look stranger eye tell deepest emotions, phone easier times. makes sense lung cancer blame free, whereas admitting covid also admitting royally fucked up.  Oh got it. think parents collectively keep kids home, would make holding person classes pointless therefore keep teachers staff home Good thing wearing mask, thus indicating keep distance making would never come within coughing distance you. fail! pains early January crew.
Weld alternate version 2020 please. definitely right spending actually boosts economy, think problem deeper difference vouchers cash. difference cause make wrong assumption cash relief work.

The conditions ground high debt low incomes means people's priorities get hole already pandemic.

Cash relief conjunction debt relief federal jobs programs could boost economy help families survive. I‚Äôm nurse, was, I‚Äôd sigh, turn machinery take coffee break. patients really deserving limited supplies worn health workers. order medium rare, comes piece cow shit?

No, wait, fucked steaks somehow. America. harder give cocaine away free. bf feeling went Costco Thursday. loaded cart (got deep freezer week too), clerk asked owned restaurant. Statewide shelter place announced next day. never doubt instincts again. Yeah sure hell stop Taiwan, South Korea, Singapore, Vietnam, Thailand, Australia, New Zealand handling COVID early on. countries literally share land/maritime borders China! Thats it, time start mainlining mouthwash.

On real note, bottle says contact poison control ingested, safe. like sprained ankle excuse drug production goes quality control testing. mass manufacturing, produce flu vaccine every year (and changes year year meet year's threat). Moderna Pfizer vaccines use totally new technologies, quite different process past vaccines (many vaccines use virus itself, like flue vaccine - flu virus grown within huge batches chicken eggs. ). Fun Fact: One interesting interesting things use quality control blood Atlantic horseshoe crab test bacterial contamination Another mRNA vaccine candidate; say won‚Äôt require ultracold storage. It‚Äôs behind others though; it‚Äôs entering Phase 1/2 trials, believe. thought 2016 showed dumb country loved is.  Nope 2020 took medal long shot.  faith generation knows wtf they're doing. That‚Äôs happens science though. start problem doors didn‚Äôt know existed open up. There‚Äôs always skeptics believe ‚Äúlife fine knew X.‚Äù covid there‚Äôs one left vaccinate. Im sure mean that? way covering Belgium Sweden? Someone never third world country none options  here. mean really. don‚Äôt even know need read article. Seems pretty freaking obvious why. Operation WARP SPEED!!!

Trump awesome! 2-3 days forcing people stay home would good. Ah yes sorry. edit above. I'm definitely anti science. saying hyper focus coronavirus opened door lot interesting, possibly unrelated research. testing capacity scale. we'll probably get mid December make changes approach national level. Dr. Pepper? about, once, believe personal responsibility second? people know plenty well he's full shit. morons want believe everything comes mouth blame end position. know anyone personally even someone who'd close contact last Friday. know least six people/families. Trumps gaslighting worked treat them. really are. Rest Peace thank service I‚Äôm volunteer trial. receive $1,300 paid 2 years.

God helps help Schools essential like grocery stores hospitals Ah see, grocery delivery problem doesn‚Äôt surprise me. I‚Äôve watched Instacart people grocery store. They‚Äôre people trying get job done. touch phones million times. touch cold storage handles. sometimes touch terminal keypads. less act normal.

When shop, sanitize cart handle myself. bring paper list (the phone stays car). usually use said paper list open cold storage or, mess up, follow hand sanitizer pocket. 

And yes, wipe groceries home transfer whatever boxes (cereal goes reusable bin, example). 

I absolutely sick too. I‚Äôm that.

Everyone know shopping, don‚Äôt wipe groceries. think I‚Äôm crazy. tell it‚Äôs half hour week, cares? I‚Äôve blown time Reddit. Haha This.

Italy hard lockdown, look numbers right now. end level delusions drank orange kool aid . Thank service. 
We hope two vaccines (and announced) came work. April.... hate, rage, converted rabid, fervent denial. going admit could be/are wrong. much pride, ""losers"". mean, fuck, look election.

These people believe virus *before* infected. continued say believe virus laying bed, told infected it, likely going die.

It's test faith lot them, brain-dead is. Sure, might *know* deep real, they're going deny, deny, deny. They're going continue function, act, like real. means washing hands, wearing mask, heeding CDC's warnings.

In end, matter actually know real. actions matters. point certain chemicals within mouthwash killing coronavirus could lead development using certain chemical compounds vaccines example.

Chemicals kill viruses (like alcohol, bleach apparently mouthwashes) nothing vaccines. goal vaccine make immune system better fighting virus future, destroy virus already spreading body. Canadians point view. Americans fucking stupid fuck reason compare Denmark Sweden countries large amount returning skiing tourists March. That's major source spread countries somewhat similar outcome.

I‚Äôm sorry virus spread Sweden. returning travelers alps contact traced spread contained. outbreak instead seeded travelers returning UK, Netherlands USA, crucial weeks known cases spread completely undetected week 11 community spread starting pop up. point late stop. March, great focus Italy Swedish sports holidaymakers went Alps ski. also side infection analyzes, clearly see enormous imports Italy, says Karin Tegmark samples analyzes made April, different pattern seen. Italian infection much less common instead countries stood out. established infection entered Sweden several different countries, United Kingdom, France, Netherlands United conclusion authority draws infection control regions isolation infection tracing large extent prevented infection Italy gaining foothold Sweden. Instead, infection entered country number different countries pandemic already important aware came Italy infection them. important effect. see Italian virus galloped away, says Karin Tegmark Wisell.

These stories sickening, even include Dolly Parton. still means reduced quality care people sent home would otherwise admitted.  That's.. Interesting. would thought would way higher that.

PS: people also blame Asian-Americans this. I'm Korean-American exhausted people behave family since beginning year even though gone beyond distancing masking locking down. Really sucks get lumped this...I friends fucking Filipino-American doctors told racist idiots want ""American doctors."" 1 zero problems Zoom.

History looked kindly means locking hungry people stole food, black kids pot.

History consistent issue. look badly Nazis mean look badly choose bring harm world ""follow orders"". They‚Äôre going come Mobile since still going allowed parades. 


But even parades cancelled, streets going flooded people. Yeah, am. Obviously _some_ viruses modify DNA.

The entire city Saskatoon, Canada full hospitals Sunday.

Yes, Dakota's, people North Dakota's. google want. entire province overrun end week, Manitoba Alberta way abyss right 

TLDR stupid obeys national boundaries sounds cool. Even everyone vaccinated then, holiday easily done plenty distancing outdoors sun park. Thanksgiving &amp; Xmas BBQ, everyone beach chairs space out. probably eliminate risk would better everyone crammed inside breathing air sitting chairs/tables. Green Bean casserole best thanksgiving food, change mind valid concern Im saying United States response good, said bad. 

We setting daily records, take account per capita posted per 100,000 stats.

Regarding waves, US drastically different countries. graph would appear small wave March, middle wave July, midst large wave now. European Union hand small initial wave March, nothing summer - massive one significantly worse US. 

The people follow guidance isolated *just* united states. That's super scary! hope everything goes well surgery. said, hospitals covid patients separated rest hospital and, even allow someone visit (at least live), way come caregiver even let time. amount cases states, I'd surprised hospitals least near future. I'd give call facility surgery taking place ask precautions effect. Maybe take anxiety must feeling. really hope everything works you. Please stay safe!  seriously wonder people even care. Many seem incapable taking responsibility behavior. Right lol. strong feeling another mandatory lockdown it‚Äôs going ‚Äúwait out‚Äù type thing vaccines fully deployed. used feel way. would cause lot anxiety felt like trouble getting enough air. definitely learning curve, that‚Äôs right term it. months on, it‚Äôs almost comforting, weird way? It‚Äôs like little security blanket face. Two good studies summarizing state art published October: Here's[a systematic says 17.1% overall household attack rate. combining estimates 22 studies.

I would lived Alaska.

You're asking us wait hours sun come melt ice.

You're asking us wait ~~two weeks flatten curve~~ indefinitely something go away literally clue ever go away. literally said ""boohoo"" notion countrymen died Vietnam WWI, good reason. Also, 1918 last time global pandemic required shutdowns people wear masks. 

Turns even back [idiots like refused believe Spanish Flu real. also shamed right thing. need bloody freezers this. Packing dry ice fine whatever small number days needed just-in-time distribution.

The word nonsense FUD. try impinge rodent licking rights! article look like written human being. Dakota lastly moved final week require masks sure settings imposed enterprise restrictions. slaps. I've watching twice day stay motivated xD hold firm insanity. one damn Thanksgiving different year. like happening, going smaller year.

I'm getting ration shit wife too, look chart see risk happening year. Maduro democratically elected people somewhat popular housing initiatives. others not.

And Kim Jong-un obviously horrible horrible person, would probably taken less time Google name type wrote. Something weird like people purposefully get Kamala Harris' name wrong. Thats strange. 

I remember going TJ Maxx couple months ago even counted 3 month old (at time) twins capacity count. makes sense. rule level exposure amongst test subjects vaccination determining effectiveness vaccine?

We've seen countries, even lockdowns , hundreds thousands cases, thousands deaths span 4 months.  read saying ""a mask protect 100%"". sane reasonable person would read that. yes family kive driving distance share general concern pandemic

Ah wonder family caught it. respiratory diseases. Yelling.. singing... masks predominantly fit designed hold disease.... common man....really?

Better EATING (with mouth) talking yelling without mask happens family gatherings. numbers back well. okay that's fine keep living world safe eating indoors around extended family drives see you. I'll stay here, infected, thanks.  sounds like point knows risking choosing eyes open. Nice outside! paying this? government? obvious disgusting cash grab. People never believe China, even like bunch scientific studies prove that. Reddit general gets boner ""fuck China"" general. mention good portion world seems anti-science days. 

&amp;#x200B;

Considering fucking stupid incompetent governments outside Asia pandemics, think could even disaster started US Europe. right, although based single study, rather reviews multiple studies. checked latest, although best current estimate household attack rate 20%, spousal rates probably somewhat that.

Two good studies summarizing state art published October: Here's[a systematic says 17.1% overall household attack rate, spouse rate elevated that, without point estimate. combining estimates 22 studies. Here's [another combining 43 studies, overall household 18.1%, spouses 37.5%. 

I agree 20% spouse downplaying - however, nowhere near 99%. co-worker cubicle next planning flying central Wisconsin Thanksgiving. work Maine, pretty safe compared family back Wisconsin. co-worker flew North Carolina couple weeks ago, learn unless hospital. family Midwest fighting lives right too. learned yesterday apparently people literally dying still believe know it‚Äôs tried can‚Äôt define it? don‚Äôt dinner smh.

We political party 20% votes northern part. huge part base thinks covid hoax used big governement oppress hard working man south blame north shoudn't go lockdown. one person made orthodoxy, himself, anything help represented treason him, party, ideology. basically everyone party went along. can't focus what's caused Covid-19?



Especially discovered twice likely among Covid-19 vs patients conditions time see covid-19 patients compared suffering issues, team compared data six conditions (including flu fractures) time period. found likelihood covid-19 patient diagnosed mental health issue first time twice conditions. thought settled bleach, UV light ass far remember cells supportuming olfactory cells ACE receptors get damaged, neurological per se. I'm guessing cases coming people going multiple private gatherings

Getting drunk, eating out, going bars, going church.. course masks (or bullied wearing one)

Grocery store spreading undoubtedly mix probably small percentage mean, also wasted amount time lives, doesnt knowing alone world shit make feel little less horrible? vaccine successful year first outbreak one biggest medical achievements, *the* biggest, time. could much longer, much harder belgian way find backdoors. large group follows orders well, group large totally ignores measures behind curtains.

Look vote Propositions. We're definitely liberal typical Canadian liberal. add good explanation. (in)famous virologist said:

There significant group asks: 
1) backdoor?

2) actually impose fines?

3) actually check break rules?

4) rules ridiculous offense radiologist friends. radiologist don‚Äôt know shit take care patients. I‚Äôm cardiac surgeon. (republican Democrat) appalled someone like could there.  It‚Äôs like asking someone builds navigation systems military suddenly made four star general wartime. It‚Äôs completely stupid. know. made believe corporations could things. BS start distrust anyone trying manipulate thinking that.

Every single city US could presence distribute vaccine. question posibility. question political will. billionaires needed.

Hold government accountable. could seen coming ?

But hey, keep voting Mitch McConnell friends, masks socialism, decent healthcare system socialism, might also treat poor people minorities.

Sorry cant explain better already. Sorry loss. 


there arround 2k assumed covid deaths. Covid also cause cardiac arrest. sick demands body, heart deal anymore. get I'm talking you, I'm talking you. Anyone see numbers themselves.   extremly unhealthy population. 1/3 Americans obsese. Eat much. much sugar enough excercise. Look Japan. I'm scientist someone explain importance this? virus mouth, probably already lungs, right? Would help leasen amount virus system?

I can't see helping reduce spread like coughing, unless constantly gargling mouthwash. getting number? haven‚Äôt drank even liter water day eaten one meal 2 hours basketball workout.

This seems like much likely explanation. would highly unusual symptoms show within hours exposure. Although, course, could gotten infected days ago something else. I‚Äôm sure, I‚Äôm looking popular even opinion mirrored others don‚Äôt mind. welcome discussion someone shares different view means please share it, looks like they‚Äôre downvoting poster content. considered 1-week delay?  poorer countries cause demise EU, Eastern European ones constantly proving Anti-EU despite getting assistance member state. 

Poland view expelled EU. Joined 2004 absolute basketcase Economy. [100 Billion] spent rebuild economy (more EU state received). 2014 example, Poland recieved 17 Billion EU funds contributing 3 Billion. 

This include massive immigration Western Europe also helped improve finances Poland Polish people. 

But Poland insists acting like beggar thinks king. Constantly electing Anti-EU presidents, setting Anti-Gay Go Zones breach EU rules human rights, banning refugees breach EU human rights, hosting US military bases, constantly trying undermine EU-Russia ties wishes Germany/France. 

My view European tried welcome Poland much possible expel let try luck Russia, since that's apparently want. 

They incapable acting like Europeans. 

This recent holding Covid relief package agreed 26 member states order extort money par course Polish. I'd like see control fact dementia often goes undiagnosed while. cases may caught evaluated covid, covid. grandmother's best friend diagnosed flu years ago...people attributed problems normal age-related memory problems, evaluated, doc noticed sign worried suggested also evaluated dementia.

And depression anxiety? stress testing positive terror wondering get serious case enough trauma trigger depression anxiety disorders. cause relapse mental illnesses.  feel you. two terrible options.

- Indoor dining prohibited. Tens thousands businesses close Millions people lose jobs. 

- Restaurants stay open. Volume 50% many people choose go peak pandemic. people get sick die. restaurants close. people work. 

- oh yeah, there‚Äôs third option. Mitch McConnell passes emergency aid restaurants people lost jobs. afford stay safe disease control / vaccine widely available spring/summer 2021.  Sorry, mate, company's presence neighborhoods

A presence neighborhood could truck something. would need presence form supermarket distribute vaccine? It‚Äôs ok, math everyone  Yuppp. spring break every bar crowd imagine. know that‚Äôs picked up. without reason. Dude spineless leader.

Dr Amy Acton resign got death threats jellyfish gets keep job 2 years. sketch referring to? Tried googling failed. too. Viral vector me. True. recipe, sorry feel, really flexible. 


Basically chop four five slices bacon shallot maybe half onion, fry bacon rendered shallots browned. Crush couple cloves garlic add good amount chopped mushrooms (8 oz? Maybe pound like really mushroomy). mushrooms cooked down, add tablespoons flour stir mix well everything (you'll get lumps otherwise), pour cups cold milk. Heat, stirring constantly thickens up, add ounces grated parmesan. Add canned fresh boiled green beans, taste salt pepper season taste. Pour casserole dish top french fried onions. Bake covered bit pulling cover let brown.


Super flexible, it'll work even screw lot lol... peer-reviewed published scientific journal.

Ergo: means buy yet. currently equivalent blog post. might prove solid, might opposite fall apart peer review. it‚Äôs time off, I‚Äôm going. I‚Äôm done giving away 20‚Äôs. vaccine out. It‚Äôs over. capitalism evil thing. drug companies using charity US government funding research, turn around make fortune taxpayers funded research. really free market, they'd pay research cover research costs profits drug sales succeed.

This socialism drug companies R&amp;D, free market time distribute drug need it. system rigged taxpayers. ban pls PhD program never taught definition prevent? stopped believing ‚Äúas a...‚Äù Yeah reduces pretty quick familiar positions trying better trying every bit helps. Governors harder time undercutting federal support. I'm imagining next fast furious movie car chases freezer trucks trying get destination vaccines melt! think shocking people taking seriously rather direct mitigation tool.

This shocking. funny. essentially Moderna contracted trials Vandy avoid conflict interest, Parton donated Vandy? Dang wish gym. friend people wear masks whole time. single staff member wears mask, big sign saying masks required. There's definitely push back staff members regarding wearing mask keeping good distance. cases up, deaths still low af? statement made isn‚Äôt irrelevant. facts matter regard Covid. never said couldn‚Äôt spreaders, it‚Äôs big deal, simply said kids don‚Äôt appear dying virus. statement wasn‚Äôt meant imply anything beyond that.  real new research? go half-cocked. think people outright deny existence COVID. think they're scared politicians overblowing risks dangers justify power grab, legitimate concern have. become hard breathe, wet mask also loses protective function. end breathing mainly slits mask face opposed filtering fabric, since latter gets clogged up.

In experience, short intense activity doable, endurance heavy sports really work. anyone good examples governors handled real well? friend say current administration can't blame different countries, states dropped ball. fined cost contact tracing related medical expenses. Again, people already disease. again, vaccine prevents person getting disease first place. making point. talking gibberish. point...

(Even still ‚Äúalmost everyone‚Äù still gonna shy hundred thousand people) Well I'm covered then. went back played fo NV fo3 mods. Might poor choice given circumstance, enjoyed it. encourage read [this People generally want work projects. Risk capital get things done‚Äîpeople work get done. Profit motive capital get way.

Fuck USSR, went feudalism space 34 years. Capitalism way innovate. insight you. not?  curfew. No, all! fact I'm it. I'm skeptical effective going governors allowed invalidate efforts counties cities manage outbreaks effectively. going require lot oversight enforcement. trust officials said believe refuse enforce mandates (which sheriff's departments again?). even then, still people believe apply sneak around mandates orders throw parties shit anyway. place people report violations enforced equally, effective control.

I also worry wiggle room mentioned federal guidance allow reluctant states, officials, individuals skirt rules things. I'm adding another link you. government promised raises medical staff fights covid. voting Parlament members Parlament added raises going healthcare workers. even nurses doctors fighting disease directly overwhelmed work.

So government tries kill resolution healthcare workers Noem get married. reposts. Oh look, lies. I‚Äôm saying many parents can‚Äôt simply decide keep child home. Keeping schools closed protect teachers responsibility people charge. don‚Äôt can‚Äôt expected parents willingly sacrifice financial survival keep kids home.  most. almost everyone.
Almost everyone make covid winter. something something sample size  say no. sister family wanted come visit, we're 60 mom 97. WTF, people think someone besides themselves. Unfortunately Absolute line nothing. mean tried country worked. haha guys made original basement joke guys funni please laugh hold years make renewal ceremony! bash seem weird 10s thousands people knowing risk outright evil.

Well, know one chosen then, we. carryout delivery only. Yah, food pretty vital. Theoretically course could US, Europe, anywhere really.. extreme cost, economic loss life. Hospitals would strained, collapse, people would die ailments became overrun. Natural herd immunity far less appealing option immunity via vaccination. would take significant amount time reach 60, 70, 80 percent infected recovered... here‚Äôs hoping vaccine it‚Äôs distributed then. think disconnect television. specifically doctor showing tell people wear masks work. Further, doctors sort saying anxiety, things fine mask on. Well, can't.

Its like applying bandaid cut leg. people think going work? sort Benny Hill thought experiment?

I dunno, class warfare real. think people want die that's really sad. Doctor, it‚Äôs wife. She... said something seems kinda fucked internet. Please, doctor... please tell there‚Äôs cure  One first polio vaccines caused Vaccine-induced polio year so. vaccinated person didn‚Äôt get sick infectious. schools become place respiratory diseases like COVID-19 quickly spread

LOL. wonder many government scientists needed come ground-breaking piece insight /s

Seriously, like forgot everything know respiratory viruses thing started. know multiple people traveled Wisconsin things could Illinois. teacher know recently went eat indoors burger joint wedding anniversary. nuts. City Alabama know normal retail businesses open past 10pm anyway? Shops UK generally shut 8pm absolute latest cant find 3M stock Shes already stated shes pretty left leaning dsa territory. Lol Travel allowed within bubble countries low covid cases. 

All international visitors also required quarantine 14 days hotels. 

The difference Asia cultural use masks strategy eliminating curve. 

Many western nations tried flatten curve, worked bit cases still community resurged people got complacent. 

For example Vietnam total lock almost month. point all. Got it. country touted except US? unknown, definitely goal (via infection anyway), since would mean we've allowed 1-2M people die US. Humans herd immunity coronaviruses cause common cold, get reinfected ones. Another reason people get sickened, virus mutate. Better keep mitigation policies place, wear mask (a high quality mask fits properly!), get past rough patch hope two vaccines (and possibly more) rolled everyone spring/summer. - (insert dictator‚Äôs name) entered chat I'd settle releasing data. all, *all* based upon Pfizer's press release statements. 

When stop caring peer review? get we're hopeful now, but.  right remember years back folks like arms ""both sides"" bullshit came evolution....

well, chickens coming home roost.  I've quarantine like 10 months video games getting boring tbh. CEO said Sure would great. I'm referring governments current stance. doses bought, production distribution reach general population anytime soon.

The reasoning vaccinating high risk groups health care (or otherwise essential) workers makes pandemic manageable. could handle larger outbreaks better stuff spiral control mainly young people succeptible. honestly believe China world consequence virus. limited knowledge, reading lot articles variety platforms publications, China's bad luck. know obviously virus uncontainable. matter China would done think would spread internationally.

Well think disgusting wet markets everywhere banned - also think humans vegetarian.... digress subject. symptoms? I've dealing fatigue lately. sure related covid though, might exercising much. Yeah, entire business staked able invest research hopes ends profitable covers cost research. think replies missing point. people saying ultra profitable drug companies somehow need rely charity fund research? Give break. 

It's bad enough can't even see full text government contracts. leaked Novavax's contract looks like government funding vaccines future price controls patent licensing price guarantees. vaccine manufacturers setup win/win business models themselves. that's bought stock 6 different vaccine companies months ago.

Except we've *never* black female governor ""saint"" quotation marks made point live ""new normal"" ""save economy"" eradicate virus completely. Also, pledged save elders according Confucian values. 

China completely eradicated COVID, thinking city Wuhan. China several outbreaks since Wuhan extremely transparent it; goal elimination, failed...or maybe that's goal they're losing sleep panicking outbreaks know handle them. Unless member CCP, idea goals are. Remember even react proactively first, needed lockdown Wuhan severely first place.

I'm much advocate China's current response next person, there's reason lie make look better are.  Well cases slowly going that‚Äôs mainly due partial lockdown, would guess. 45k figure includes data past week, last 24 hours. Maybe we‚Äôll see downward trend continue tomorrow. Positivity also going slowly steadily. Nobody's forgetting that. companies profit billions dollars‚Äîcounting cost trying things end working out. profit part specifically waste. extra money charged consumers goes pockets shareholders. know way many people thrown employment 2 weeks flatten curve. know people felt isolated tried take life. none would happen two weeks didn‚Äôt last 8+ months Aha, referring Trump's lawyers:

Thank standing gap us. Imagine patient mistakenly thinks vaccinated actually not. 

As described yourself, unaware deception, patient inevitably changes behavior - say, volunteers help grandpa chores ends infecting killing him. done deceived.

Now consider study 30,000 volunteers. 

Comparing typical college psychology experiment maximum possible harm getting hiccups uncontrolled laughter, clear rules ethics strict vaccine trials. what's going happen 10 years line suddenly everyone starts getting side effects untested mRNA vaccine?  Go world data use data explorer.

People saying like it‚Äôs sure thing. may may long term issue. see way many calls revoke man‚Äôs medical license valid indictment governor‚Äôs overreaching mandates. 

People need rise up, especially saying provokes type vitriol. Let freedom ring data already analyzed rolling review long EUA granted data available?

I'm wondering thing, searched though bunch articles see long submit FDA, article quoted thing: ""in coming weeks"". know likely able get vaccine spring, knowing distributed nice milestone hit quite extreme weather. good point. Eventually won‚Äôt impact us.  please use CDC recommendations masks isolations instead use Canada‚Äôs 3 layer 14 day recommendations country America fucking dipshit insisted Sturgis go on? raced Gamestop in-person preorder, calls anything. soon saw tweets preorders already jumped car went over.

Also benefit others taking too. Lol virus serious one would need plead us. stfu let us live lives peace scared little children Takes 2 second google search find family different rules constituents.

Just like mayor DC. Authoritarian hypocrites. states/counties/cities realize what‚Äôs coming backyard? Obviously general public (many, all) many areas couldn‚Äôt care less virus risks.

Watching unfold like watching 792 car pileup slow motion. 

Politics greed taken front seat empathy compassion. Never life ever heard someone losing sense taste month cold. understand that. Vaccines can't wished existence immediately distributed though. moment can't even get federal government fund state budgets. logistics involved distributing vaccine probably become possible Biden takes office January 21st. 

Please temper expectations fast happen. deep south state

I hate ""that guy"" TN mid-south Good No, it‚Äôs already paid US govt taxes.  Yeah, three days scheduled work, mind you. Also, friends lot coworkers. Go figure. Mr. Pibb: dude didn‚Äôt even get degree! drop school start making pop soon? won‚Äôt actually happen UK. friends coworkers countries. UK positioning press know it, Germany placing police train stations ensure people actually wearing masks. 

In Germany force bring doctor‚Äôs note take time sick, I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre talking about... force bring note calling sick - sure hell make sure got vaccine... Terrible take. pandemic cannot compared war genocide, taken toll people many small ways. it‚Äôs Americans covid fatigue, world large. 

And coming someone thinks it‚Äôs bad idea go back lockdowns CA back March/April. people lockdowns dangerous risk getting corona. ultimate fact many people don‚Äôt want deal with. work addict recovery program 5 men die since March due overdose due lockdowns. Covid deaths ... lockdowns literally deadly.  Couple rise domestic violence, depression, malnutrition, job loss, business closures, inability see family, etc etc... 

I‚Äôm advocating measures made it‚Äôs simple ‚Äúlockdowns suck‚Äù people‚Äôs lives irreversibly damaged them. needs attention respect Covid, take turmeric/black pepper/ginger supplement every day. feel achy sore. godsend. Anyone good date graphic nordic countries statistics? Tired seeing Sweden used 'good' example. Thanks. consequences? face them, cult little flu... absolute wonder goes people's heads. find thousand sources corroborate claim, people tell fake *one* person YT said so. 

I always try see things people's perspective, case, fail time time perform mental gymnastics needed make sense it. real derangement syndrome. Hopefully next 50 years US step 20th century.  That‚Äôs like Chicken KFC. definitely helped rile crazies, already rile looking someone like him. Absolutely one. campaigning ‚ÄúWomen Trump‚Äù Ignorance bliss let conspiracies get way. Everyone criticizing Sweden, COVID death rate less half Cuomo presided New York State.

NY State dead; 
Population 19million

Sweden 6000 dead 
Population 10million 

Yet paint idiot Nursing Home Killer Cuomo kind hero. Everything designed deliberately kill elderly folks nursing homes. parties shifting cult

Speaking cult, I'd bet good money died COVID denying existence absolutely problems believing talking, burning bush actually existed. immediately thought point well, compared non-hospitalized people caught Covid people caught comparably serious illnesses time period. 

One open question whether increased rate Covid patients caused 1)the virus 2)something extraneous virus, example social isolation Covid quarantine. People broken legs (who lower incidence mental health problems) quarantined. Whatever mechanism, mental illness another downside catching Covid even case 'mild' stay hospital. im worried recovery. people around continue shun them. get facts this?

- virus resurface person recovered? 

- long stay isolation recovery?

- recovery, people still get tested positive covid, worried? still contagious? matter? practice anymore. He's obviously political advisor now. Sometimes it‚Äôs best let people choose path.

I‚Äôve wasted much breath since January trying help/warn others virus coming winter. Everyone still thing. Oh well. Assuming N person ineffectively vaccinated, number infected among vaccinated N*(90/15000)=5, gives N/15000=5/90=5.6%, rate ineffective vaccination. efficacy therefore 1-5.6%=94.4% 1-5/95 RT checking in. Love nothing walking around unit treat patients like game Covid minesweeper. That‚Äôs diagnostic language right there. ;(   fuck outside podunk shithole state even knows name? everyone already knows human rights violations China, Middle East, fucking USSR, doesn‚Äôt even exist anymore. many students, Americans general, completely ignorant oblivious USA‚Äôs numerous human rights violations.. USA majority students live in, pay taxes to, elect politicians in. priority chipping decades propaganda students endured informing students well censored human rights violations country, immediate impact on. They‚Äôre gonna waste much time going violations non-existent government like USSR, places like Middle East China everyone already knows atrocities easily find information on. 

They focused Middle East Latin America US country went in, invaded countries, destabilized them, implemented regimes committed human rights violations. want students aware less likely fall shit previous voters. 

Of course humans rights class gonna ‚Äúsprinkle oppressed gay people‚Äù.. *because gay people enduring human rights violations like murder, genocide, imprisonment, torture decades/centuries*. expect learn about? Dismissively bringing gay people like telling shows exactly mind at. 

These university aren‚Äôt trying sugar coat communism ignoring Chinese USSR atrocities, two governments even remotely communist reflect ideology people left all. governments slapped ‚Äúcommunist‚Äù name party mean they‚Äôre actual communists, let alone reflective left leaning ideology.

People like exactly class like focuses US. doubt ? easily search 10 year history Reddit

I see loser/support loser Take stroll along beach SD, people generally stay far fuck away you. There's plenty space strong sea breeze, exactly risky place be.

San Diego mostly liberal, done OK till honestly. People generally wear masks distance, experience. worst offenders I've seen tourists severely mentally ill (of few). 

The worst spikes southern part city, lower-income Hispanic area. I've seen solid explanation infection rates much worse.

SD's infections spiking _bad_ now, however, move purple overdue. need indoor dining, fuckin 82¬∞ today. 

Can't speak Irvine. watch people refuse take it. always rounding corner downward spiral That's argument? cold cause loss smell taste That's bit misleading, like beds country one big hospital everyone get to, look smaller area thoughts too. many people would keep putting neck others, many idiots running around axes. true per-capita deaths much less useful metric more- less-developed countries, think still useful within countries similar development levels.

While Yemenis obese, unfortunately plenty [starving due war; malnutrition usually makes harder body deal sort infection. massive cholera epidemic couple years ago clean water. (But also money infrastructure much COVID testing, knows what's really going on?)

According Johns Hopkins mortality data, Yemen reported 2.12 deaths per 100k population. CFR 29.2% huge outlier countries world. Possibly comparable countries development-wise: Somalia (CFR 2.5%, 0.71 per 100k), DR Congo - Kinshasa (2.7%, 0.38 per 100k), Afghanistan (3.7%, 4.35 per 100k), Haiti (2.5%, 2.09 per 100k). Bro. She‚Äôs even state. See campaigning trump months. Exactly. surprised one every five people experiencing type depression type mental emotional hardship time. cause virus changed pysche somehow lol  Sure is. leave things Undefined ambiguous definition someone fill space. bad it‚Äôs Tucker Shawn 70+million Americans. Unlikely called number back jar pickles mailed one. Pretty cool. hospitals capacity. Opening beds doesn‚Äôt mean fully staffed Nurses, Doctors Respiratory Therapists. Every part US surging cases hospitalization. help parts country. Healthcare Staffing infinite resource. It‚Äôs fixed. get sick quit system collapse they‚Äôll institute Crisis Standards Care. happens lots people die. 


I feel bad inmates, probably already got nickname ‚ÄúThe Grim Reaper‚Äù. Thank service. would even fucked without  mean put 500b table think that's enough I'd rather take get nothing üôÑ

This whole situation stupid like sides want pass another round stimulus since can't agree amount americans get nothing. Fuck congress! Ever long island? uncommon beaches.

I‚Äôm sure ‚Äúproper disposal‚Äù means ‚Äúdumped ocean‚Äù ok thx. yeah I'll def ask doctor. Tylenol never works me. last flu vaccine decent fever chills 2 ibuprofen's nuked it. It‚Äôs definitely edit based area. may refresh source super often stats could measured different ways (such normal capacity surge capacity) people can‚Äôt see distance ripples stone cast. focus Impact point. efforts control pandemic?  thanks current estimate schools/universities open completely manner similar identical pre-covid days? spring 2021 semester probably certainly going online, fall semester? chance might end online well? Making 2021 effectively completely online. another stimulus passed,that much guarante. Feds keep economy going  true. much better message would exercise group indoors unless wear mask. I'm also pretty annoyed people making information make disease seem worse is.

These people fundamentally think people stupid, need manipulated constant state panic fear, lest stop wearing masks social distancing. entire mentality based absolute hatred contempt humanity, viewing utterly stupid utterly selfish unless coerced fear. 

Yet mentality seems dominant one sub, come months today, came today see sub would react good news immunity trying attack shit it. Good thing lot less ITT expected. think that's mostly due low visibility post, though. Also internet tough guy lol. defense facts understand usa always shit Wow, running wild nursing homes there. ... Great Reset begins... fuck everyone offshifts then.... Explains cell immunity far east isnt hard hit. generally significantly higher similar corona viruses circulation.  That's one 700 people North Dakota today considering positive percentage hell lot more

Before Thanksgiving. still idea would thing FEBRUARY year... asked best friend plan summer trip (she RN) responded probably happen due covid. woke up, cannot believe na√Øve Everyone knows ham better turkey! Thank you!!! explained well Try different designs. I‚Äôve found duck bill style ties instead elastic bendable metal nose bridge best people. also use medical tape bandaids cover edges leaking. want pm address, I‚Äôll send one duckbill masks make.

For anyone sews, it‚Äôs Uof Florida Health prototype #2. wish felt like party wearing mask lol might really inconvenient request could provide literature vaccines better natural infections mechanics immune system described?

I ask because: that‚Äôs headline here. Wore mask riding smoke earlier year. totally sucked. work way harder exercise, even lungs don‚Äôt. mobile morgues hold dead bodies. u/pharma-bro 
‚ÄúYou gonna cry‚Äù 
No sweetheart. love 10 PM garbage ""thing"" now. anyone know Governor Baker first one US time around? joke: ""Look hard trying control covid spread! close gyms, indoor dining, bars, movie theaters, churches schools hours people would use them? What? No...why would help? idiot!""

This country literally needs saved vaccine, really twisted part even it, people even take it.  Day Beyonce Turned Black mom expanded pod recently health nut grandma grandpa. extra careful. even think go groceries, get delivered. go either except groceries (parents work home, full time zoom student). safe thanksgiving? people see. think simply safer see anyone, mom really wants thanksgiving. felt like longest slowest moving year since pre-teen.

It feels like years since first started hearing it. Lost job really enjoyed abroad beginning this. move back home. Self isolated 7 months shitty tutoring job paying minimum wage. this. people ask drink much escape Thanksgiving alive.....just wait! Christmas coming. guilt trip gonna kill lot people : ( sry that. i'm going change this. thx  must open schools fall, conservatives said.

Well know covid time worst rates here. Covid one battles people forget economic toll pandemic caused gonna worse. It‚Äôs gonna pretty it‚Äôs said done. realize people go bars party dark? deters people going partying, rather meeting group people spreading virus. doesn‚Äôt work people like don‚Äôt follow curfew. Federal government : let states decide!

Also federal government : wrong!!! latest stay-at-home order merely advisory, Governor Evers probably anticipating he'll sued tried actually pass something ""teeth."" 

The Republican-led Legislature conservative-leaning WI Supreme Court blame now. think that's downvote worthy. Lots vaccines bad first rounds. long ok idea may able certain things without ""vaccination paperwork"", say you! Fill shit like thanksgiving turkey! Can‚Äôt blame feeling way do. Statistically, 99%+ us will. ""Our safety milestone achieved already, preparing submissions""

Another thing said kids school going back remote next week parents group FB PISSED claiming ""studies show kids school spread covid"". call bullsht. know studies published said states numbers (New Hampshire) doubled since school started back up...its coincidence testing. bad experiment. read already spread Italy September 2019.  said every husband ever! ""Look honey! science!!!""   Nicht gut people sub complain news reports science, clue science actually saying. Go figure people screaming ""follow science"" tend ones idea they're talking about. side effects harsh. Think awfully sick laying bed 24 hours. rare side effect. It‚Äôs function body reacting properly shot. govt needs proactively spin somehow people going really balk getting it.

[trial participant think argument heavily abused justify pretty insane profit margins pharmaceutical companies. Look extreme growth profit figures tell honestly whether may skimming little much cream society's health budget. case covid vaccines even argument work lot cases, many governments signed contracts pre-orders cover cost, well providing funding building new production infrastructure. pharmas even bear risk turns work.

I work hospital WI we've recently reminded company's ""refusal work"" policy. refuse work, got 24 hours change mind. still want to, abandoned job. human's oxygen requirement change whether wearing mask not, body needs certain amount oxygen exercise. Naturally, body usually strong enough provide negative pressure required lungs draw required air. introduce mask, suddenly bar required pressure draw required air amount time increased. way increase pressure contract muscles dilate lungs even more, require work, thus energy. Since energy required amount time, means successful oxygenation without hypoxia require higher power output chest/diaphragm muscles. power diverted many muscles involved jogging, funnily enough, extra exertion probably require higher amount oxygen. matter way put it, mask properly fitted functioning (aka, mask isn'

It seems precipitating factor virus becoming human threat, often jumping one species another, causing mutation process. 

SARS MERS civet cats dromedaries, respectively, intermediate hosts. 

Covid seems likely fur bearing animal like minks civet cats. 

Humans caught viruses bats directly before, viruses haven‚Äôt spread, don‚Äôt seem pandemic potential viruses passed intermediate host humans. 

If want decrease possibility future pandemics, part efforts better separating domesticated farmed animals wild animals (especially good virus sources like bats), separating humans wild animals. 

The outcry usually ‚Äúpandemics going happen encroach wild areas‚Äù really would seem theoretically take bats roosting mink farm, domesticated cats catching bats, number likely scenarios potentially cause another one. I've worn mask since cool. know... 10 months ago redditors angry ""following science"".... CDC... Fauci.. said wear unless caring someone sick.

I'll never wear one outside (unless I'm large crowd.) be... I'm stupid. 

Why...? airborne degree get open sunlight... hiding it.

Mask ""prevent"" coronavirus. may help contract less severe case... thats if.  

Put glasses (even wear them) fog... mask working anyway. Neck gators... better tucking head shirt.

#### Abstract

In March 2020, expert panel called Front Line COVID-19 Critical Care Alliance (FLCCC) created led Professor Paul E. Marik, goal continuously reviewing rapidly emerging basic science, translational, clinical data order gain insight develop treatment protocol COVID-19. time, many centers groups employed multitude novel therapeutic agents empirically, within clinical trials, often inappropriate time points well-described multi-phase disease. Either result frequent trial design failures, due lack insufficient anti-viral anti-inflammatory properties, nearly trialed agents proven ineffective treating COVID-19 November 11, 2020. Based recent series negative published therapeutic study results, particular SOLIDARITY trial, virtually eliminate treatment role remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir, interferon, convalescent plasma, tocilizumab, monoclonal antibody therapy. Despite growing list failed therapeutics COVID-19, FLCCC recently discovered ivermectin, anti-parasitic medicine, highly potent real-world, anti-viral, anti-inflammatory properties SARS-CoV-2 COVID-19. conclusion based increasing numbers study results reporting effectiveness, within vitro animal models, also numerous randomized observational controlled clinical trials. Repeated, large magnitude improvements clinical outcomes recorded ivermectin used prophylactic agent also mild, moderate, even severe disease states. review follows existing evidence ivermectin relies ‚Äúemerging‚Äù data that, although compelling, minority studies published peer-reviewed publications majority results compiled manuscripts uploaded medicine pre-print servers posted clinicaltrials.gov. Unfortunately, willing hold 300 person wedding state mandates capped things 30, unlikely worry collateral damage. even acknowledge it. say illnesses occured time period? think 1/2 country given up. I've called coward WIFE responsible staying home much possible.

I get it, locked too, want crippled life get covid damage. food industry. Slaughterhouses meat processors. Veggie farmers aren‚Äôt spreading it. 

Animal exploitation started pandemic continues worsen it. Right? thanksgiving March control. Yep. People need stop falsely attributing shit COVID. actually happens alot Canada esp flu season. Health care underfunded. said er nurses better job handling urgent emergent medical issues floor nursing, round nearly often. sometimes wonder many cases U.S. (where I'm from) people stupid. addressing pandemic, Gates said absolutely nothing contradicts reason science. directed massive resources help fight it. Criticize past business dealings want, admire change heart led put fortune good use, encourage billionaires same. see like mandatory evacuation orders, kinda reverse. Everyone must evacuate homes case. little different wildfires, less restrictive. Mandatory evacuation wildfire means can't go back home leave. Makes sense. Even dedicated efficient medical staff limits. Genuinely caring lives tends really irritate lives matter crowd? Excuse moment pick jaw floor.  F ex  really news.

Lol, since mattered anyone small number though subject selection bias. lol Damn... done biting truth.

I declined usual thanksgiving outing, older adults present. want responsible anything. family meal highly unhygenic. Even she‚Äôs wearing mask whole time? don‚Äôt roll around entryway. Proper preparation would mitigate risk. Walking setting plate wouldn‚Äôt pick up. I‚Äôll honest could 30 degrees outside would worth seeing family members able eat distance.

But Florida sound nice lol company firing refusers. I‚Äôm sure thousands people need jobs would gladly wear mask. People aren‚Äôt taking seriously minimal consequences noncompliance. honestly fair say. actually said think many people actually remember take precautions right away like should, right actually kinda easy. good know thinking right away, think people thinking similar thanksgiving situation necessarily thinking sanitation precautions. go alabama, anywhere south northern virginia horror show masks People think government conspiracy trace everywhere people go. There's way hell we're ever going convince otherwise. Killing two birds one stone? Feeling blessed live somewhere people largely 1) wear masks 2) know better talk random stranger. People say we're rude around oh well! record breaking, 95/96(dec/jan) 88/89 (dec/jan) 93/94 (dec/jan) deaths april/may. hundreds monthly pairs recent times Sweden deaths measure death toll relative population size. promise much. might still things know. 100% blame high death tolls countries governments...  can't tell do. I'm going Thanksgiving. believe sky god, don‚Äôt believe modern medicine? Adds hope expecting special treatment develop cardiovascular lung disease decades early. still - think Reddit beta testing one users That...is really important point. 

Throwing rocks people refusing wear mask, committing assault protesting makes violent protest. quite arrogant assume know best interests, somehow do. Sounds like something neckbeard actual experience might say. one single policy works. look Asian countries (like Singapore, Taiwan, South Korea, etc) plus Australia New Zealand controlled Covid situation well. 

Just recently, South Korea considers 200 cases crisis 50+million population. Europe US considers similar numbers (normalised population) control. loss smell taste considered neurological effect? People dying every day since beginning humanity. Therefore shouldn‚Äôt anything, ever. It‚Äôs science. sure may hear someone close hold small Christmas funeral. fear mongering realistic view life pandemic. denied help government opened shop early august.

I feel comfortable judging situation small article, think reinforce need effective government support programming pandemic.

I believe capitalism best tool allocating scarce resources amongst competing interests benefit humanity whole, mean humanity exists serve capitalism. certainly mean capitalism infallible must never interfered with.

The Canadian government certainly made mistakes pandemic, approach supporting individuals businesses struggling pandemic seems good case study reminding us money, business, government, economy exists serve humanity, way around. Even dying breath, still hang delusions &amp; denials even literally killing them... right shameful double standard people create downvoted contradicted narrative immunity short term, long Yah. Lots confusion there. media isn‚Äôt helping don‚Äôt explain efficacy means context. wish they‚Äôd better explain increased rate infection people mental illness? agree people stay home reduce risk.  Covid-Denial another way reduce anxiety, Covid-Denial may comorbid classic diagnosed mental illnesses like anxiety depression. New Mexico says keep butts don‚Äôt come casesü•≥. Already happening. cousin works ICU. Halloween party goers ICUs. currently one bed open. suspects filled one car accident patient. happens, beds.

Then Thanksgiving/Black Friday. Add two weeks huge surge. add Hanukkah. Add two weeks another surge. add Christmas/New Years. Add two weeks another surge. I...actually think that's inconsistent character.

He'd blunt honest, always treated death somber sacred non-sacred manner materialists really understand.

I went doctors office yesterday everyone masked up. Perhaps one people claiming Sweden refusing care old people make statistics look good. not. deciding tge balance is. 

An example. uncle hard core ""no care guy"".

No genius, fact many viruses tend cause death own, weaken body's immune system point easily overcome bacterial fungal even protozoan infections. yet another reason patients ICU need shit ton supportive care nurses medical staff, keep eye stuff treat coinfections arise addition keeping patient sedated breathing.  problem glasses fog instantly anytime physical activity mask on. tried methods I've seen online, still can't see shit moment get 1 2 reps in. time big deal, incredibly distracting heavy lifts like squats.  refuse go meds anymore.

First day back punching bag literally exhausted 1 minute pretty pathetic, least 100% masks fault. question. gym yesterday talking buddy mask on. telling girlfriend, day two prior, around people COVID. isolating okay? infect deliberately. wait people get infected. Also nobody knows (not even ones administering vaccine/placebo) vaccinated received placebo since done entirely randomly, look fact received vaccine. Since done randomly large enough sample size subjects know got vaccine not, average behavioural differences two groups.

What imagine people got certain side effects vaccine (such fever) might logically conclude likely placebo group, consequently could behave differently. kinds things scientists much aware of, take account.

All comes results see: scientists confident 2 vaccines highly effective. data gets peer reviewed pretty much certain. Things looking good.

Disclaimer: I'm expert.

Edit: also fun fact: since vaccine effective, moderna researchers planning vaccinating placebo group soon possible real vaccine, since placebo group 11 severe cases covid-19 probably could've prevented vaccine. bad massive pair *adamantium fucking balls*. many ways, proud governor. hahahaha. OP doens't even believe already shifted friends family. special That's right there. 

They mean-spirited spiteful.

Exactly opposite moral values Thanksgiving commemorates.

Their hypocrisy come full circle. people work servers bumfuck nowhere. Let's say 50% country gathers Thanksgiving areas virus rampant, 5% country serves bumfuck nowhere virus rampant. Guess majority viral spread going happen.  Good luck totally see might case.

I sister bipolar disorder. high functioning impulsive, extroverted, full restless energy. hard time staying home avoiding social activity. Indeed, makes depressed. least bit surprised got COVID summer. contracted friend. cancelled thanksgiving feelsbadman.jpg. ten people though 3 different households. recommendations seem suggest within household, lot came past week Honestly, think that's good point, generally. really nothing proposition people are... Misguided.   

It's 'never see family hide inside forever' 'do whatever want'. plenty measures would help, even 100% foolproof. Wear masks, limit gatherings outings. moderate actions like planning help lot everyone actually them. 

Also, enjoy holiday. I'm sure people give grief, seems like smarter many others üëç Username checks It‚Äôs Cuomo‚Äôs fault. weren‚Äôt trying ruin businesses turn us socialist/ communist state would Black Friday.

well, 2020. living middle-ages anymore. must discriminate group citizens different.

Seems like one things never needed investigating before. 

There much research funding available moment unusual studies carried out. British neighbours right thing take note France soon possible.

Considering one anti Vaxx countries world prior COVID-19 pandemic (if most), vaccination coverage going awful joke.

Last polls indicated little half population would take vaccine suspect portion would actually inclined take soon released, ""Uh I'd rather wait might long term side effects"".

If Americans tired butt jokes Coronavirus, worry next year we'll take here. We'll Thanksgiving exactly way always have. like links prove point? Along great band name, think nailed best descriptive slogan 2020. family friends still planning thanksgiving Christmas, cousin getting married December, declined since I‚Äôve exposed covid fortunately haven‚Äôt developed symptoms yet I‚Äôm self quarantining.

My Facebook feed full people going bars, visiting friends family, maskless. feel bad saying point, get deserve it‚Äôs plain ignorance.

Nobody going convince home alone watching netflix eating takeout styrofoam box I'm working every week make money sustain.

But course people want talk thinking great is, instead admitting also effect beyond people get Covid, can't waved off. is, feel way it. can't play Twilight Zone ""It's real good thing can't get cocktail, real good thing."" still nearly enough.  article: ""Viruses one emerged China late last year mutate constantly new variants necessarily worse previous ones.

So far, study shown newer variants SARS-Cov-2, strain causes Covid-19, contagious dangerous predecessors."" Pretty sure talking Dolly.. talking official test sites Denmark.

One wedding, 117 infections 7 dead traced super spreader event.

You probably still think hoax. Oh sure cold driving building tsunami. know that. reason think Nevada think dry heat - cold doesn‚Äôt come mind. Shutup idiot normal spring/summer pipe dream social distancing forever /s new studies estimates around levels needed herd immunity (or least virus burnout)? best article I've seen subject could use new info states approaching [40% FWIW North Dakota (estimated 39% ever infected) flat week now. early say South Dakota (37%) Iowa (31%) follow. followed international closely Belgium seem steady decline similar saturation states mentioned.

If 40-50% magic number that's obviously good news require ton vaccinations get us there, especially hard hit areas. vaccine become available general public April, see scenario cases/deaths already super low point (due combo seasonality, pop immunity, early round TUE vaccinations). Combine anecdotal BS social media side effects vaccine could looking culture war fight makes mask issue seem like fun games. attributing Pfizer, OP seemingly everyone doing, dumb annoying Capitalizing Mass Incarceration!!! Last night went run around block. 55 farenheit so. first lap throat hurting lot breathing cold air. went car n95 mask able run 3 miles without feeling daggers throat.

Wear damn mask! Canadian: please, no, friend. last time UK came innovative medicine? Pretty sure almost USA. Additionally, net worth 120B compared 500M. 200x much money power does. Bill Gates benevolent billionaire overlord, billionaire overlord nonetheless rest world gets benefit American innovation, Americans pay nose ambulance ride? seem... Fair. So, actually work Clinical Research, Academic Institution. 

This kind set-up uncommon. lay groundwork, can't doctors usually treat people one day decide conduct research. ton work needs go place this. Clinical Trials heavily regulated industry (despite people online like think). So, Moderna came hospital said 'here go. test drug', FDA auditing agencies would field day going terrible conduct hospital.

A clinical trial needs make sure everyone conducting trained, appropriate credentials, put record show they'll trial (administering drug? consenting patient? taking vitals? etc). 

A good research facility infrastructure place make sure everything done correctly. They'll someone documents regulatory requirements, someone makes sure patient actually part study, someone document every thing happens study, someone administer drug...... goes on. 

Now, Vanderbilt good research department. anyone works facility like tell thinly they're stretched. workload anyone balanced they're (and, people say they're assigned be). 

So, sudden get request take part experimental drug like cure fucking pandemic. going 1) get TON people want take part study 2) paint giant bullseye back review/auditing. 

What people research field understand doctors stuff get rich. They're either legitimately want help people, like figure answers problems. So, they'll take new trial, even means putting 100hr weeks. actually care $$ drug make. want part system found cure. 

So, money someone like Dolly Parton donate helps this. allows hire people. lets get hardware, software conduct trial. allows expand researchers working, participants trial coming location. allows make sure people involved study ensure study conducted correctly, data collected correct. Covid group project school prepared us it‚Äôs looking like nobody changed anything. kind like post bc get shut actual facts What's beautiful about""Jolene"" song full emotion: love, fear, vulnerability, desperation, there's really *anger* towards Jolene. singer acknowledges, right beginning, Jolene power merely pleads wield singer's relationship.

Genius take. Go drink another six pack, Bob. never accused murderers. killed them. saw kidnap Dabney Coleman, Dolly ruthless. Also least us, according latest polls 60% people wear mask daily basis. 

That eating responsible 80% new cases. 

That huge deal. everyone followed doctors scientist advising could maybe eradicate without vaccine. nothing rich business owners, ones benefiting lockdowns. small business people don‚Äôt privilege working remotely suffer most. Bar restaurant owns/workers middle class workers suffering most. sorry families sickness disease part life unfortunately can‚Äôt stop living every time highly treatable disease comes around. far income inequality preventable deaths handled logically allowing low risk people continue life normal protecting elderly high risk.

No wonder many us consider people fucking joke ignore asinine proclamations. definitely scared sh!t enough people enough take personal international precautions. Unfortunately lot infections people caring loved ones dealing remains. means US, given many people already it.

Its going take longer clear pandemic world wide sure. I‚Äôd say 75% are. republican alpha male,farmers, elderly aren‚Äôt. work cellular carrier that‚Äôs open whole time people still want go car sync Bluetooth maskless. lack education staggering. get Americans visit sub, crisis mode coronavirus problem started all. many things revealed massive flaws system. anything, considered scientific experiment outside viewers. paid 40 cents hour? understand young brides grooms insist wedding, anyway. know, know....they laid lot money reserve stuff goes wedding, rather, mommy daddy did....I digress.

Nothing going stop anointed ""big day"". cultural, America, nutshell. smarter ones said, back spring, ""ya know, let's put off"". did. NOW, continuing problem April. fairness, remaining smart ones might wanted put even longer, near end year, may actually gotten resistance financial side things, outfits made reservations with. money-grubbers going roll reservations 2021. money put reservations deposits long since spent. refunds, credits, nothing. Get married now, lose good. Meanwhile, perhaps smart young lady chap tried move 2020 wedding 2021, find plans year unavailable 2021, money gone, now, all, situation.

Fucking ridiculous. guess make through. many us cultivated blindly believing authority figure choice. authorities users, abusers, megalomaniacs. would pretty sweet covid already still take precautions feel kind unnecessary times available area. last town lived one recently moved to. Suspected key word.  obviously China still lying covid numbers, right?

According worldometers whole country 4634 deaths 353 active cases year long 2 weeks flatten curve eh Watch video. nurse says hospital dying refuse believe COVID. definitely, absolutely, fucking symptoms. Gates also mostly doesn‚Äôt stuff America. Please go see neurologist. may stroke. true.

Certain nerve damage would make anything touching face excruciatingly painful.

Science reporting absolute gutter level stuff general, science works well enough, direction evidence building fairly steady direction along albeit plenty uncertainty (and need caution) Saint wrong word her. saints really despicable things! that! extreme cold must impact people‚Äôs ability kind reasonable  Apart February mutation suspected contagious right,? guidance clear. Agreed better safe sorry, plenty references saying another test necessary. hate 'that guy', but... *No shit?* always try keep time patients ventilators minimum.

Also back April use old ventilators staff trained tasks. I'm saying posed risk guess normal circumstances less stress staff sometimes make magic happen. Third degree burns face, buying tp costco condition. 

In seriousness, really, no. People significant lung disease wearing masks long pandemic, really piss poor excuse. 

While people PTSD, anxiety disorders, SPD like may find masks uncomfortable, still wear working therapists and/or physicians appropriately handle increased anxiety resulting symptoms. shows much dangerous COVID compared influenza. steps taking almost completely eliminated flu coronavirus infections continue climb. 

Can imagine carnage taking steps all? graph ends week October 26th, 44th week.

If look beginning graph, also starts 44th week so.

Basically, telling us much far. everyone using every day? Seriously. headlines while, going universally available? do, Google title says ""song Whitney Houston"" might point. Yeah, saw earlier. Thanks link. 

Problem is, meet criteria - tested positive again. references ""may need another test"" say anything another positive. Don‚Äôt use wood chippers dispose frozen bodies Fargo there's one entity Earth shatter Fox-built propaganda cages brainwashed masses, awesome power Dolly Parton's love. burns heat million suns, try build barricade keep loving she'll burst fake-tits-first give hug.

The medical board actually usually comes fairly hard nonsense.

They come way hard ask drug/alcohol issues.

You test positive drugs hair sample (consumed last 90 days) yes mean marijuana, it‚Äôs 1-2 years weekly random urine drug tests, allowed alcohol, join AA, maybe 30 days rehab, smoking joint bachelor party 3 weeks ago. It‚Äôs insane. 

But stuff ACTUALLY affects patients gets ignored, Atleast seems Thanks checking!! appreciate :) happens buy discount AI package. that's problem. state level leaders say enforcing it, we're leaving bit individual counties. individual county level leaders say no, we're going enforcing either. So, gets followed individuals choose follow it. There's difference intensity humidity masks produces lungs vs vast majority regular climate, even tropics.

This seems like much reliance basic data points looking human body highly complex. systems telling us ""breathing compromised"" extreme situations (not all) wearing mask, cannot hand waved.

Humans biological machines. parameter quantified triggering issues lead reduced work capacity many people. honest genuine question. lockdowns even working? Italy hard lockdowns, numbers went back like nothing happened. Japan lockdown people responsible wear masks they're relatively fine. shit talking america, europes getting bad again, arguably better everything US.

It's seems like nothing working I'm getting hopeless. vaccine can't come soon enough True, population density urban suburban living situations would counteract no? feel like many people complaining little discomfort, real disservice people legitimately problems it. Kind like people casually say OCD gluten intolerant, making life difficult actually issues. governors take blame, federal government take credit economic recovery. health local issue, economy federal issue.  people wasted year, made profound improvements died. Sounds like life every year. Turkmenistan Covid cases either!

Totalitarian dictators like horses seem exceptionally good containing viruses! think stupid OP way hyperbolic dramatic meal multiple households stuffed one room, sharing food, wearing masks nothing like going march open air mask on...

She‚Äôs international treasure! amazing human being. Can't say blame them.

Read study.  


You need 99% air pulled lungs. That's one main points. stated conclusions *sensation* breathing harder, looking lung function, O2 stats, actual *effect* negligible.  


Let put way physics minded way. 3 meter diameter pipe feeding tap. turn 2cm diameter tap. get water. Someone puts 50% blocking filter 3 meter diameter pipe, horrified losing water. plumber tells I'm idiot. tell feel like life negatively impacted. plumber still right.  Belt road initiative seems kinda imperialist, seizing foreign territory nation defaults debt late paying it. (Hambantota Port Sri Lanka/Ceylon example) 

A big reason China powerful let become production capital world, thinking would liberalize fall Soviet Union. 

Did modern Chinese government claim DPRK? speculation part? 

I‚Äôd say we‚Äôve Cold War China since 2017. I‚Äôm sure system prevail. (not wish different form governance, seems we‚Äôre reaching breaking point. least perspective seems US-China relationship lot like Pre WWI German-Russian relationship. highly industrialized power still edge much populated rapidly industrializing power, fearing lose edge becoming erratic foreign policy result, could attributed towards current administration‚Äôs incompetence, would less poetic.) 

I know mean wish would praise independent journalism call terrorists suppress whistleblowers expose governmental overreach (domestic abroad) (the President Elect called Assange ‚ÄúHi-Tech-Terrorist‚Äù, VP time) rich though.  think shocking people taking seriously rather direct mitigation tool. That's swell. People see Republicans problem problem well. goosestepping right alongside telling everyone need go along see point view. operating modifications? Social distancing, masks, reduced person attendance etc? example, kids' middle school, walk certain direction exiting classroom. foot traffic goes clockwise. Even next class one door right one leaving, walk way around. They've zero cases open 2 months. Ireland republic.

Greece republic.

France republic.

Italy republic.

Switzerland republic.

Being republic nothing it. republic democracy lacks monarch. 1.5 percent false negative rate nothing sneeze at, article even says people use replacement actual tests. 

A false sense security super dangerous. There's enough already. Pfizer vaccine. Saved click. Who's steal it? Mine around New Year's think? post /r/news made pretty high talking new disease China- wish could saved post. anxiety really bad beginning year reasons (Covid certainly help) immediately started taking notice. like slow-moving hurricane. Forced/ fake cough much get tired heat, definitely appreciate lack humidity. People like part problem comes later... last week florida averaged 28/100k half peak 56/100k per day july. 

take look : places 784 (56 per day two week average)

edit: add, desantis might never change mind even florida numbers triple point winter It‚Äôs amazing tell government, don‚Äôt know we‚Äôre going handle still get help Everyone knows COVID vampiric virus infect people night. Stop watching MSM research once. 20,000 people die day lack access clean water food, children least likely suffer serious illness COVID19. get numb able eat, drink live life without thinking every single day? hunger 100% preventable - keep mind throw 3 day old leftovers didnt eat. He‚Äôs noob I'm curios next pandemics going like. False positive rate way high. released wide scale detect would false positives. Media likes make things big clicks = ads = $ etc. think conspiracies, personally naivety anything ... here‚Äôs picture tree... Thanks sharing article OP. informative quick read. FALSE article mentions preprint peer reviewed. also talks believe immunity may last years conclusion. Whoa, numbers. mean, really know sure lasts years, years actually pass. coronaviruses immunity last 45 weeks start going immunity threshold. SARS covid closely related showed immunity 3 7 years. advise would hope years still cautious really know. much 8k cases yesterday...knew obvious error. blame first foremost linux niche OS (well, family OS's). come long way, honestly say years, linux partition leaner, faster, way stable win10 I'd say best windows yet (and one finally acknowledge linux exists).

The whole internet, android, osx, lot proprietary software, roots unix, dual-booting desktops always massive pain ass windows. never got technical it, many years, many distros, many hardware setups, always windows cause problems. calibrate mics every major phone. Yikes tad hyperbolic, remotely reason try robust national strategy. congress on-board (which b/c GOP senate), could readily tie federal $$ compliance get states board. couple refuse, it, use whatever powers isolate travel, etc. Lol. absence medical treatments, humanity survived? genetic diversity sheer numbers. True, COVID kill microscopic portion population, overwhelming majority people develop symptoms. small portion will. weakened genetically susceptible become sick. strong survive pass genes following generation.

That‚Äôs humans survived. COVID isnt last, either. It‚Äôs merely latest. airborne viruses follow, repeat process.

But life goes on.

This isn‚Äôt zombie apocalypse. coronavirus class virus known long lasting immunity established get strain twice. medical literature predates covid19. information wrong covid-19 special somehow? guess I‚Äôm interested immunity look like long run. I‚Äôm assuming immunity may guarantee blocking reinfection maybe disease. Like case Hong Kong. caught virus never developed symptoms I‚Äôm assuming infection didn‚Äôt get lungs.

I‚Äôm like lot people I‚Äôm learning whole matter way complicated first realized. unlearn lot movie narratives. wonder coronavirus feel realizes can‚Äôt infect anyone 10 PM anymore? least air dry. like steam room time. person responding snarky comment actual information. feels like used punching bag, ask someone pointing reality hurts you. elderly parents live PA sent photo inside restaurant VA wearing masks. plan come back PA go MD Thanksgiving.

So... nothing changed. We've 10pm alcohol cutoff months, guess new rule keeps restaurants occupied past 10 completely whereas food 10.


Groceries carryout still okay considered essential. retail store groceries open late anyways nowadays. Everyday miss Amy Acton more.

Doctors say anxiety caused social isolation uncertainty surrounding pandemic may exacerbate symptoms, though isn‚Äôt likely primary cause.

For pre-existing mental illness, one reasons may interact medical system much maintenance mental stability. interact different doctors therapists psychiatrists going increase risk infection. concern routinely go pharmacy.

Another reason could prolonged periods stress uncertainty compound effect people already mental illness. the
difficulty long term coping, immune systems may run stress. that‚Äôs case, may self-medicating alcohol something else also damage physical mental health, increasing risk infection.

It‚Äôs also important think age demographics mental illness diagnoses covid infection rates. Young people diagnosed much higher rates ease spread high school college aged populations, well generally 20s. also highest rates mental illness diagnoses. isn‚Äôt mental illness makes likely, it‚Äôs correlative. Many young people mental illness also happen get covid. it‚Äôs similar way around important remember Pandemic course people going report poorer mental health even avoid virus, doesn‚Äôt consider stigma hardship comes infected coming tunnel covid, speak.

there is. Everyone wants gather quarantine 2 weeks holiday. nobody infected, there's risk everyone spending hours together room. problem comes people going stores, visiting friends, going bars etc spreading virus everyone else. stop things plan ahead large gathering want safe.

Actual answer: acted quickly decisively heavy restrictions, couple overboard (but given circumstances, completely forgivable IMO). prominent dipshits White House used opportunity play peoples‚Äô stress fear telling essentially rebel restrictions ‚Äú#freemichigan‚Äù thought would score positive political points. time get shit got wrong hope know AstraZeneca vaccine Oxford vaccine thing I'm also small gathering family. 5 us total 4 households (most us live alone) extremely vigilant social distancing throughout entire pandemic especially weeks leading holiday.

Cautiously optimistic. work restaurant get it, really do. provide *absolute* safest environment still allowing people eat drink. cap many people table, keep people spread apart, hyper vigilant mask wearing, nuke tables between, etc. CoVID cases were/are repeatedly going up, amount eating friends responsible. Btw: recently regression analysis hospitalisations versus daily deaths. Deaths don‚Äòt scale linearly hospitalisations, exponent 1.5 (both GER UK, assume true countries). 10 % increase hospitalisations brings 15 % (not 10 %) increase daily deaths. Don‚Äòt know is, fit really good. ""I runny nose. flu got flu shot."" long term effects particular worried about?  mom (64) says "" die Covid... I've good life. need morphine drip I'm pain."" people google symptoms don‚Äôt get tested need work haven‚Äôt received another stimulus He's base. huge win, everyone. looks like new cases dropping, ~30k yesterday Swedish ""vaccines cause autism""?

""It dangerous believe vaccine covid-19 solve problems disease entails,"" says state epidemiologist Anders Tegnell SVT Agenda.

So basically, thing Fauci saying. argue saying ""get people want take vaccine"", presenting getting infected naturally safer option many anti-vaxxers think. mean? Like changing tone lockdowns vaccine widespread available all? point vaccine get lockdowns. moved OH CA.

/s ""Any technology, matter primitive, magic understand it.""

 - science fiction writer Seinfeld history It‚Äôs gonna one claim fame, peaking 28 I‚Äôm okay  Ocean, caves wine? people life lottery. deaths: 1,331,643

Global cases: 55,327,021

1,331,045 / 55,327,021 * 100 = deaths: 252,624

USA Cases: 11,529,800

252,624 / 11,529,800 * 100 = 2.2% Really? Wishful Thinking! Corona Mary Bloody Mary lime right?  Fuck ‚Äòem. Live best life. Bit late that.

And I'm sure people hiding test results ages. mostly speculation, think large part Americans giving fact majority identifies Christian. 

I think fact many Americans least disposable income, corporations made *very* easy donate (for example asked making purchases, even popular donation boxes common sights checkouts) mostly self-reported data even selfish pricks I've known would readily state they'd ""helped stranger"" ""given charity"" even really stretch definition 'help' 'charity' it. think way people described it, like hangover. bad I've never hangover. right 90 percent time. never wrong? think Jeff Bezos engineering genius? thinking thought positivity rate suspect, low due enough testing. Back beginning October SF seeing 3.7 new cases per 100,000 residents per day, 10 new cases per day. also happened beginning October indoor dining allowed, along easing restriction indoor activities. happening return restrictions place SF's new case rate better, reasonable measure take. UNC Researchers THINK! really one year. lot progress made vaccines coronavirus variants SARS MERS, funding trailed outbreak contained. picked left starting scratch.

Tech also helps. tools available researchers far, far better developing Mumps vaccine.

And course, money.  Say something like 10% vaccines turn good enough, rest fail research/phase1 (total guess, probably right general idea). Trying one time would take many, many attempts several years. Right there's 80 various stages research testing. So, fail rest efforts encounter delays, odds still high things go mostly smoothly quickly least couple them. government subsidies likely total billions doses needed, worth R&amp;D costs even unlikely first/best. problem answering questions results vary person person haven‚Äôt able determine yet

Without widespread testing everyone don‚Äôt know many people asymptomatic walking around super spreaders. 

Some friends stopped producing antibodies 3-4 months one friend gets tested every two weeks still antibodies, meanwhile son husband stopped producing months ago infected time. makes sense! Lmfao really wish would become normal wear mask you‚Äôre sick public. perfect world, people would stay home sick seems apparently bigger ask wearing mask. much expect. US still far largest foreign aid provider world. 135 days go. Fauci said could then. Ok and??? I‚Äôm still getting lol want life back! ""literal plague."" one thing, actual plague bacterial, viral. fatality rate third half everyone infected. Covid-19 might kill .6% overall population infects. [Thanksgiving Every exponential graph start sigmoid.

The people like lucky enough work home, hard infect.

It'll flash anyone works retail, anyone face-to-face interactions customers, workers. Everyone actually works, sit ass home day.

It'll slow eventually, gonna fucking ugly hits straight line middle unfair. Really doesn‚Äôt feel like long term thinking.

The lack long term thinking definitely goes ""open economy"" people recognize unchecked pandemic going way damage. shut fuck dude Follow question asked earlier. yesterday spent time brother, left found friend saw Friday tested positive Covid. He's waiting days get test, planning quarantine 14 days, technically contact Covid positive person, believe to, although that's plan well.

However, need get things store, right I'm thinking going tonight tomorrow morning would best time so, since incubation period makes unlikely would contagious pick up. Obviously would mask up, probably double mask up, go hours, stay really far away people, would bad idea so?  think every Monday?? Fauci literally saying yesterday. He‚Äôs king new normal crew Good news everyone! Thanks, appreciate kind words. agree said, political party become joke. understand completely, wasn‚Äôt one downvote wanted explain view situation you. wish best tough times hope feds give help need soon. wish federal gov would implemented hard lock flue mess began. seems like taking one step forward 17 steps back. waste time, money lives. mean, right.

But good, safe thing invite anyone house anyways. protection, protection, protection strangers. give friends zoom call instead.

The virus would die weeks possible literally everybody stay home transmission. Obviously that's feasible least try part limit spread.

No single raindrop thinks responsible flood. single snowflake thinks it''s blame avalanche. Thanks. criteria pretty esoteric, think better idea now. Really, vaccines lasting immunity? going get boosters frequently thereafter? could easily dealt months months ago willing give thousands people virus intentionally. Considering death toll, moral imperative. science sound ethics primitive yep definitely open everything /s seven died weren‚Äôt even party.

Second, today's numbers (Monday) they're incomplete since I'm sure West Coast reported totals yet (this Tweet 4:00 Pacific time) 

As right lot claims made vaccines spokespeople drug companies parroted news outlets. Neither vaccines peer reviewed sample sizes small. one really knows side effects may occur sample size 1MM people.

It‚Äôs huge disconnect needs fixed problem local, elected officials ones enforce COVID restrictions communities there's widespread refusal comply. they're concerned future electoral prospects, there's perverse incentive deny problem exists. hear you. I'm pointing covering numbers well. Especially states like Florida. Thanks, I‚Äôll look them. nice. Ah bad man I‚Äôll delete mine oops seems like shit gonna end summer 2021... we're lucky :( farmers aren‚Äôt spreading it.

But are. Vegetables get processed similar facilities meat. [I'm amazed Ralph Baric Gain Function dismissed humans actually created virus 2015, 

""scientist Ralph Baric, Ph.D, team included Baric‚Äôs Wuhan Institute Virology (WIV) colleague, Shi Zhengli, used genetic engineering synthetic biology create ‚Äúnew bat SARS-like virus . . . jump directly bat hosts humans"",

Ralph &amp; Shi 5 years make vaccine didn't?

There much needs talked virus like ""where come from?"" far science cannot find primary reservoir guess [""a bat living Italy, may potential primary reservoir ya'll attack conspiracy theorist please realize *NOT* making theory here, simply pointing facts readily available web, like this:

[Genomic analysis revealed SARS-CoV-2 phylogenetically related severe acute respiratory syndrome-like (SARS-like) bat viruses, therefore bats could possible primary still found bats SARS-CoV-2 virus know August 2019 [problems disposal dangerous materials led government suspend research military‚Äôs leading biodefense posting others may want search origin virus. posting ended search. stopped caring came answer cannot found web.

What disturbing humans actually made virus like SARS-CoV-2 four years ago bother develop vaccine it. maybe one comes nature ready?

Makes sense create virus infect humans first place *not* create vaccine . . . human? Ok well reading CDC article, I'm gonna go ahead trust consensus masks show reduce risk (and even viral viral load/viral dose?). I've wearing masks whole time, stop so.

However, skeptic friends family say something like ""oh yeah, trust cdc? Bunch liars scammers"" lol agree vaccine news right really shareworthy certainly don‚Äôt timeline yet, people need hope. 3.23% death rate? It‚Äôs ok, guarantee majority northeastern states‚Äô county sheriffs won‚Äôt actually enforce this, fuck unless you‚Äôre wasting resources police patrol block every neighborhood looking houses places looks like gathering happening?

Restrictions like waste time people see it, get ‚ÄúI‚Äôm American I‚Äôm fReE‚Äù start outright trying find 10+ people hang prove point. 

What need better mentality wanting voluntarily. Americans weren‚Äôt ignorant human beings, wouldn‚Äôt need restrictions place. We‚Äôd mindful causes virus spread rapidly limit/cease types activities ourselves. they‚Äôve said, cancel dinner party, postpone/downsize wedding possible, church masses online. Little shit like difference hundreds thousands cases. meming edited comment less sarcasm Yes. does. Giving BJs loser president detriment 7+ million state‚Äôs residents. Deaths surpass first wave rate mask mandate here, everyone wears inside shops, recommended outdoors can‚Äôt keep proper distance. live densely populated area &amp; can‚Äôt guarantee keep kind distance anyone given time. wear every time leave home. Plus toddler &amp; doesn‚Äôt understand gray areas yet. masks go on! I‚Äôd love know first heard virus reaction was. think remember thinking wasn‚Äôt big deal, video China showing people yelling apartments lockdown. That‚Äôs realized dealing real shit. Again, real kn95 I‚Äôd inclined agree aren‚Äôt. counterfeit reported ICU capacity numbers tend bit 'horseshitty'. March/April, many states added fuckton ICU beds increase theoretical capacity. Given this, calling occupancy 'normal' based percentages alone inaccurate best outright deceptive worst.

However, like OP mentioned, staffing real issue. America saw second peak summer, scientists repeated continuously seasonal virus üòÇ 

Italy EU countries low amount cases due two three month lockdown. many repeating process. Also, it‚Äôs colder, people spend time inside, Europe, course cases going up.

The American inaction leading better result European action. need look graphs compare cases deaths. exponential growth much worse EU. 

A three month long lockdown useless. objective flatten curve keep disease controllable level. objective eradicate it, least effective vaccine available üòâ American hospitals except New York back March/April, fine ...Dr. Marty, infectious disease specialist Florida International University, frontlines pandemic since beginning.

She said healthcare professionals pressure hospitals seeing spike first time COVID patients.

‚ÄúStudies shown many 17 percent people positive resolved problem done okay, ones testing re-positive. Among people test re-positive, people ending time hospital,‚Äù said Dr. Marty... feel like hate good news evidenced thread trigger you: normal mostly come 6-7 months  realize Operation Warp Speed fast they'd filling mobile morgues.

Edit: sauce please, lol This! Lemme join downvoted section buddy. ppl gonna realize apocalyptic Armageddon type super flu media GOVT's depicting? 

The govts worldwide like whole summer prep ,but haven't. could build facilities provide compromised ppl like elderly ppl underlying conditions ,who ones dying pretty much.

 nop ,instead isolating catering covid threatened population ,they've locked us,the driving force economy like slaves basically ppl begging more. GVT's financial injections gonna run begging anymore. Well ,but food ,not lockdowns flu sudden important anymore. really wish ppl could see 5 min future realize living world starts resemble North Korea. reason rest us must sacrifice. Shame you. never liked ""oxygen levels"" argument. Even work harder breathe, lungs still get oxygen. That's entire reason lungs working harder... ensure still get oxygen needed pass out.

Masks affect oxygen levels. masks still affect breathing. mutually exclusive things. King County Washington voted amendment change Sheriff elected appointed kind nonsense. Sheriff decides he's law, county get new one. Saint Parton Saint Reeves take upon good thing good deed, saw righteousness Internet. case, ‚Äúbubble‚Äù people careful are.

We know spread driven right small family gatherings. Heading another 150K+ day, hopefully less 160K Holy shit! means 6,210 hospitals US, 12 people could hospital experiencing COVID!!!

That's horrible!!! Public health direct reflection political will. People tolerate corruption injustice don't. Populations refusing real control blame covid politicians got knockers hand her... Funny people, communities, grow sometimes. fully expect quite adult community try fill NOLA year (Orlando, Tampa, Miami, looking you). Dominoes CEO: ""Hear guys, turned 'keep pizza warm' dial complete opposite way?""  Yeah unfortunately can't. I'm familiar goes pregnancy considered preexisting condition makes sense. Thanks. sweden size NYC, NYC's highest 6,353 obviously testing good back then. Cardiovascular disease cancer cause deaths COVID. gonna lock world too? 98.5% coughs people confirmed covid-19 cases, 100% coughs asymptomatic people

I mean, trivial make something recognizes positive coughs 100% time.

`function check_cough() {`
`return True;`
`}`

What's false positive rate? autumn second wave,"" chief epidemiologist, Anders Tegnell, told Financial Times back May. ""Sweden high level immunity number cases probably quite low.""

aged like milk  People thinking precautions unnecessary we‚Äôre mess first place...do get complacent please. ones i've come across pre-print studies detailing unchecked outbreak remote Amazonian village medical intervention, another camp foreign oil workers Saudi Arabia failed implement mitigation measures. think cases suggested rates transmission slow significantly infect 60 70% population, epidemiologists caution there's overshoot R starts declining. interacts active vaccination rollout N. American urban environments ppl already taking basic preventative measures hard say. many drugs created method &amp; funding sales markets? Regulat folks also basically 0 risk march bullshit. All-cause mortality still incredibly low compared years ago. part reason lockdowns obsession COVID deaths criticized much skeptics. Interesting. thing Elvis little different. desperately wanted record it. However, Dolly approached, told Elvis doesn‚Äôt sing anything doesn‚Äôt rights to. smart hell, chose decline kept rights, thus losing version. Priscilla said, day courthouse divorced, sang her. 

It incredibly smart decision hold it, made loads it, especially with‚ÄôThe Bodyguard‚Äô soundtrack. Well suppose US quite desperate need feel-good stories (others-suck-too stories, is) right now, hence ghoulishness. Anyway, mostly pointing trashy little random insertions whatever Russian words happen know low-key hateful. infer lasts least 6 months time point however. ‚Äúidea‚Äù long does, probably longer honestly strands vaccine may elicit unintended immune reaction; minimize this, mRNA vaccine sequences designed mimic produced mammalian cells (i.e. monkey due side effects none mrna vaccine ever made market. 

Moderna famous many failed attempts bring mrna vaccines wondering would caused drastic change short amount time considered pregnancy ""preexisting condition"". Thanks reply! *read fun, memorable thanksgiving without family drama.

Same glorious!!! income tax. 80% revenue comes sales tax. Florida's constitution also requires fully balanced budget (revenue == expenditures). Since there's federal aid coming time soon, solvency state requires granny sacrificed. Op name checks percentage taxes top five percent earners contribute? Please, true!
As someone really fucked health, I'll cry tears joy vaccine gives year long immunity. mean melanin?"
