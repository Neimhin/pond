Saying seeing clear decline covid deaths similarly misleading seeing first county reporting election declaring voter turnout worse ever history! wait, everyone reported yet. caught covid right would take third booster shot anyway tell to. either/or thing?  CDC FDA sit thumbs asses, I‚Äôm going get booster soon it‚Äôs least six months. probably sounds awful, point don‚Äôt care whether someone thousands miles away gotten vaccine yet not. There‚Äôs literally nothing that. don‚Äôt control vaccines go gets what. can‚Äôt put life vaccines hold that. We‚Äôre wasting lot vaccine doses might well get many doses many arms possible. looks like Disney water supply, although doesn‚Äôt say whether use liquid oxygen treatment. Great news! Sadly we'll never know many impacted illness death ludicrous executive order. Especially since continues 'urge people wear masks' always point Augie tried control things. absolutely useless governor. True leadership needed none found. here‚Äôs numbers AAP directly related AAP story appears diving numbers CDC report linked earlier pulling data specific kids contained. simplistic explanation (very simplistic) extremists. like that, MSM pushing buttons hard can, get clicks talk, may subtle provocations involved here. want votes. Conservatives vote anyone gives sense freedom, even though hurt them. Nothing else matters. say every time things change - science evolving. going rolling sleeves yet unless want lose fully vaccinated status maybe might get even called *gasp* anti-vaxxer! that‚Äôs safe. Good point, wow. think strong hypothesis might low key working on, several death certificate changes recently multiple states.

Yeah, that's reasonable. We're already way move past it. Steady cases literly everything open. yes... I'm sure ""pro-lifers"" get coronavirus, refuse monoclonal antibodies. UK approving it. tag grossly misleading.

But comment based feelings reddit tag told believe. Behave mate. Ivwrmictin came from?

here's decent article happened TL;DR pre-print (aka, non-reviewed) study published suggested ivermectin reduce death rates COVID-19 90%. study serious problems later withdrawn, late.

There real studies showing ivermectin inhibit COVID-19 virus cells lab - reliable ones suggest works well human body.

And clear, ivermectin FDA approved use humans parasitic worms lice - right dosage. dosage far get horse cream farm store. letter American Academy Pediatricians wrote FDA encourage use data already collected move approval process along. done Costco locations Mexico shop TP Tijuana. Sorry. correct around 

And yes, knowing nurses refusing shots pharmacies tossing definitely played decision.

Rereading post, came overly dickish reason. 

My apologies Texas going take care Let‚Äôs get crazy here.  could predicted this. really embarrassing guy charge province American Academy Pediatrics encourages vaccination everyone five. fact, sent open letter FDA encouraging approve vaccine 5-12 year olds now, rather waiting. They‚Äôre telling people go buy Ivermectin cure Covid. surge tourist season? Perhaps? know risk heart problem catch Covid? .011%

For kids? stat come from? can‚Äôt find data many kids get myocarditis COVID-19 infection.  Where's advice? asked question also talked could possibly bad career perspective certain settings, people going matter. CDC going show door. Good getting booster probably destined trash anyway. biggest issue pass on. It‚Äôs suffer long term complications, possibly life long detrimental complications. people like continue pushing ‚Äúnew normal‚Äù you‚Äôre tired adhering ‚Äúextreme restrictions‚Äù like social distancing masks oh difficult make worse.

But sure, continue thinking passing along child‚Äôs biggest hurdle covid. JFC. Social Media gonna looked like radioactive watches later, swear. shit *frying* brains, I've watched relatives go nuts. Best way measure random sampling got auto banned using different source lol ""Don't take experimental vaccine!!""  
**Also:** ""Let's experiment dewormer drug, Joe Rogan/Random YouTuber X knows better entire global scientific medical community--who course, lying us *en masse*."" 
 
""That vaccine scary side effects! Check raw VAERS stats sound impressive even though understand significance. heard mRNA, new experimental gene therapy drug!!""  
**Also:** ""COVID big deal!! Mild flu!! 1% die. worry?""

The levels scientific ignorance, cognitive dissonance, special pleading, double standards risk &amp; credibility among Branch Covidians truly breathtaking. magnetism, passes get cool download speeds o. phone bill gates takes toaster fact, American Academy Pediatrics petitioned FDA approve vaccine 5-12 year olds think exactly opposite: rewards outweigh risks. wrong even gotten worst it. population developed countries gets older year.

Happened throughout vaccinations worked UK every time. high amount vaccinated people dying would say it‚Äôs sad. understand it‚Äôs mostly unvaccinated dying point sad this? happening ? even 67.9% fully vaccinated 2 September Yep, doses Pfizer same, Moderna different currently.  

100ug 1st Moderna, 50ug 2nd Moderna 
vs
30ug dose Pfizer

it's obviously much difficult schedule booster ""second shot"" vs ""first shot"" since 2nd expect vaccination record card showing 1 entry filled out. 

As someone 3 total Pfizer, #1 really sore arm, #2 #3 almost identical side effects. mind side effects though since sore arm, fever, malaise helped reassure getting good immune response.

The tradeoff getting Pfizer though studies seem showing Moderna giving higher overall protection percentage-wise. could well higher dose though.  really stressed opinion givdn current situation UK. experts evaluate situation say Florida conclusion might well vaccination indeed make sense.

Sad truth.  variants create Greek orgs point. Got it, thanks. 10%? seemed number state doing, I'm sure they'll keep pace given current load. (quietly) never learning person.  seem arbitrary thoughts restrictions ok. Restricting movement ok greater good. Forced injections greater good aren't. Rejection procreation also aren't. guiding set principles determine ok governments restrict mandate? Transmission rates Delta vaccinated unvaccinated populations. getting children vaccinated doesn‚Äôt reduce transmission/spread significant amount, chances poor outcomes children astronomically low, benefit getting vaccinated vs chance known side effects/risk (small may be) vaccine becomes much less straightforward, easy, decision.

There options vaccinations, like one dose mRNA (as opposed two), may better options children, aren‚Äôt even addressed. Given know risk children SARS-CoV-2, strong argument hasty rolling vaccinations children yet waiting little longer studies, get data, make rational response. 

There lots finger pointing anti-vax crowd irrational, justifiably so. However, see lots irrational behavior pro-vax crowd well. One recent examples everyone going along bad advice CDC earlier year related ditching masks vaccinated.

Vaccines aren‚Äôt magic solution Covid problem. isn‚Äôt smallpox, measles, polio, etc‚Ä¶ Vaccines play helpful role, need reasonable addressing efficacy well safety, especially relates children aren‚Äôt able make decision informed way adult is.

[Further  I'll never understand exactly needed even become law.

But fact became law idea scares me. thought new legislation, even state, take lots time prepare begin enforcement of. PikaMu great immunity. sterilizing immunity--that would great. reduces chances developing serious illness--for now. find boosters needed 5 months. next booster required 4 months? knows? delta, vaccines prevent infection. vaccinated people spreading now, either delta creates higher viral load partial resistance waning antibodies. Countries much higher vaccination rates US still seeing big delta surge. Fauci said accept possibility strongly resistant mutation emerge. summation seems overly rosy based hope. Speaking hope, CDC director, Walensky, said booster strategy inspired hope, evidence success thin. That's Israel weeks basically big study control group.

It entirely unclear vaccine strategy going work. rest world vaccinated, going go gone wealthy countries: slow incomplete rollout combines rampant spread unvaccinated pockets selective pressure toward resistance applied vaccinated groups. really think countries going able keep 5 month booster schedule? 

That said, need roll sleeves get boosters soon cleared.  Learned SOMA game China locked 700 million people knew real problem going affect everyone. actually 59% (2 doses) 71% (one dose), limit 18 Meh, thing matters food, masks, vaccine right now.

I wore n95 12 months kept safe. Maybe need 5 masks day. tired go?  know long takes? long newest strains around confirmation Add number unvaccinated people already covid last three months that's pretty impressive state like Texas. ""If choose decide, still made choice"" Don‚Äôt care Omega strain one kills us Schools already petri dish germs before, new variant infectious is, it‚Äôs surprising. extremely sad people will/are losing lives due opening schools early.. I‚Äôm delaying entry working in-person education sector exact reason. worth it. Meh. almost impossible catch mu.

Catching Mu2 much easier. believe schools infected since start pandemic since new variant. would known need healthy learn. Cross vax love talk dirty Lamda 3 still available though. That's interesting, agree it. Italians guess. Unless democracy overshadowed there.  Yes. fully agree restricting access people refuse vaccine anything health reasons. would far accept religious reasons although personally agree that.

If someone means something body choice it. answer second question? No, eat it. US seem greater issues children hospitalised compared UK rest Europe though, could account difference conclusions. happening Israel despite ""sucess"" vaccination? we're spell casting save kids covid, particular god we're invoking? Look Gulf Wars, US military almost effortlessly destroy conventional armies battlefield. 

They're bad counter-insurgency they're actually somewhat moral ruthless enough. Historically, way defeat guerilla warfare willingness brutalize civilian population aided harboured insurgents: ""You tell us village local insurgents hiding in, even know one, locals identify them? Fine, we'll destroy villages region then."" Whereas American drone strikes killing civilians something try *avoid*, information they're acting always perfect.

But attack nation state conventional military forces? US would crush easily. fuck food. never mentally healthy, want jeopardize mental health bars shit.  JCVI, committee made recommendation, remit individual health standpoint. medical directors UK's constituent countries asked determine whether makes sense holistic standpoint, although still seems focused individual general public.

The UK ok situation regarding overall immunity currently, makes public health decisions much difficult means proving decisions increase immunity decrease transmission advantages disadvantages, action necessary public health. necessity aspect much difficult prove.

It's possible result medical directors' review could Scotland Northern Ireland give vaccines 12-15 year olds whilst England Wales public health situations differ. Can't wait. Vaccines way mess. parents area got email saying kids/staff come school confirmed actively infected COVID  wearing mask

That's like saying ok play matches gas station, long inside pocket.

Crazy people everywhere, ratio crazy non-crazy varies lot place place. I'm Canadian definitely impression non-crazy great majority control. major parties staunchly pro-vaccination, polls show majority support vaccination passports, highest vaccination rate world Spain dethroned us, mask compliance high etc. 

But we, non-crazy people everywhere, need promote non-craziness aggressively crazy promoting craziness. coordinated disinformation campaigns need recognized countered aggressively. I'm Vancouver BC mask mandate reinstated, 2 months. 2 months, saw 80-90% people wearing masks public places, apartments, etc. We're already around 70% fully vaccinated 80% one dose. remaining 20% mix people waiting second dose, people health issues making wait, people mobile/haven't opportunity get done, small number (7% est.) vaccination.  


As taking risks, lots people active outdoors lot, indoors still cautious. breaks age though, people 30 riskier bars, parties etc, religious folk less science-focussed taking lot risks home gatherings, etc. would assume clear symptomatic difference patients, might specifically tagged. Currently variants treatments information variants little personal value, high value public health policies. certain % population never take seriously. Another % decided bored covid, declared over. take seriously again, likely demand speak manager. Derp. So, like, 2? Season 14, ep 8 according Google. I'll check out! I'm aware reasoning, really even bad reason since trying ensure front line workers access N95s. think purposefully spreading misinformation achieve end goal level damage credibility eyes population.

The dilemma 100% social media. suspect without audience ability participate belong certain group, wouldn‚Äôt problem hardly all.

fk leaders arent bright you. I'm taking two shots, though. I'm holding Andromeda. First, recommending extra shots people ""travelling lot losing vaccine documentation"" completely different statistics recommending literally *billions* citizens. former recommendation 1-in-1000 risk notable adverse effects, chances happen year all. latter case, Europe alone would affect hundreds thousands people.

Second, medical professionals tendency underestimate side effects end clinical treatment death, simply often get see them. Studies even collections anecdotes might needed get full picture. Views also tend change less cautious; example, first vaccine dose told ""you need avoid sports"", promptly changed ""absolutely sports week"" myocarditis side effects became known. feel like often seems necessary counter general skepticism population.

Third, medium-severity adverse reactions well-documented specifically COVID vaccines, understand even necessary refer different vaccine comparison. apply ointment moose testicles?! superheros wear capes üôå Im sure phrase try make post it, vaccinated yet know need to. I'm anti vax anything I'm scared could happen dont want affect health work dont know could happen even get started. something bad happen way id able protect financially lack work anything? really idea even start researching vaccine get anything misinformation there, help us appreciated. astonishing insanely stubborn and/or selfish people behaving touched fire.

We need stop believing parents means compassion right thing bring back rules place last school year. hate effect misinformation lack responsibility misinformation spreaders (especially positions power) consumers. Consumers dealing direct effects hospitalization/death. 

But many power (some even vaccinated) making money misinformation spread (through political donations, product marketing, ad revenue, etc.) held accountable role deaths. retail level, amount backlog items can‚Äôt get distributors shocking, distributors raise price 3 times far year, even holiday rush, next 3 months gonna shit show millions people thinking happens kids family.

I've seen people, I've seen many remain denial. Vaccinated people *absolutely not* ‚Äúspread much,‚Äù rumor needs debunked loudly. 

First, getting vaccine makes 60-80% less likely get first place. 60-80% fewer people infected makes huge dent itself. That‚Äôs better flu shot. 

Vaccinated people get it, may contagious, *are contagious nearly long unvaccinated people,* cuts transmission even further. 

Getting vaccinated *does* reduce spread disease. Coleman get vaccinated.  part growing number South Florida educators lost lives COVID highly contagious delta variant continues run rampant Florida. Coleman vaccinated, Wilson said. wife, earlier strain COVID last year, vaccinated, Wilson 

This article Coleman another unvaccinated teacher, Michael Thomas. One Thomas' students quoted... think feeling echoed many Coleman's students, apparently met individual Zoom calls school went virtual.  devastated didn‚Äôt get vaccinated,‚Äù says \[former student\] Bryce. ‚ÄúSo, broke something within  Yeahhh comment bit confusing! really % vaccinated it? civil obedience. reason mandate anything book.

And heaven help kid gets cold. used fight school district keep home sick. Last year fight get back came anything.

Also, high school hybrid schedule - one week school, next remote. Huge pain ass worth it. got person (masked) graduation. he's college. Students faculty vaccinated wear masks inside. government censor content greater good?

Don't mix organisational policy remove disinformation.

Is okay greater good?

Let's use words like argument discussion feel two adults lot common disagreeing something. need heat. Oh know. kid 1st grade better understanding exactly political things get school admin.   People like hear names.

Please call name Legally do. should. folks refusing vaccines many cases folks wear masks, distance, etc. public. would much less concerned % vaccinated half country hellbent letting rip regardless consequence.

Weird existential ocean metaphor thing! Key word, yet. Copying comment someone idiot I‚Äôm downplaying virus here, don‚Äôt like teacher unions choose separate deaths teachers administrative functions.
Some administrative functions done retired individuals 70s &amp; 80s transparent numbers, people don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre truthful serious virus actually is.
The Chicago teachers Union thing, touting high number deaths many deaths occurred retired individuals longer teaching.
There‚Äôs reason 100% transparent. shit dangerous. People dying. truth enough. know understood that. idea stop vaccinating. idea vaccinate people need vaccine. dosage matters immensely, horse takes much larger concentration it. Knock NONE teachers fucking vaccinated? Yes know catch vaxxed, every single one them? seems pretty obvious. Along Florida, Oklahoma, Idaho... Summerfest Wisconsin still happening year.  Maybe 10-15% unvaccinated actually hear this, actual stay home.  rest dont care title article stupid entirely misses point study. research efficacy masks. It‚Äôs efficacy mask promotion. regions masks promoted (distributed, taught proper usage, recommended community leaders) ~11% fewer cases. 

The efficacy masks confirmed significantly higher 11% individual wearing mask extremely effective parties masked.  Got booster flu shot last week. offered 4th shot Moderna tomorrow I'll first line. I'm quite happy endure couple days Fake Covid side effects rather going genuine article.  usually something vaccines prepared. Animal testing, fetal tissue‚Ä¶so on. Theres difference comfortable cruel unusual punishment. inmates may property deserve things witnessed, I'm going justify anything happened going try convince anything. following proper laws putting hundreds risk jail upon release. people often denied medical care real emergencies, guy booking hit pursuit jaw hanging slack blanket covered blood. needs needed doctor. transported low risk given bed fed chow blended drink. 

Not everyone pay fines definetly would rather sat jail 2 weeks pay 14k fines almost. judge people dont know doing. vaccinated immuno compromised fear causing adverse effects, yes know that's stupid follow 6 feet rule, still wear N95 masks etc. reason tested positive tightly packed jail fact would take people tested positive put back cell negative people.

Anything like could happen vaccine, would happen often virus. We'd know now. Masks, social distancing, limiting indoor capacity well. traditional here.

Obviously number teachers passing away, wont open long. It‚Äôs frustrating too. I‚Äôm person faith well. God helps help themselves.  faith doesn‚Äôt mean throw logic window.  

Getting people wear mask frustrating.  it‚Äôs like wearing seatbelt. Really appreciate informative posts rather ripping shreds. Y‚Äôall rock. overweight. amazed many elderly people see going restaurants unmasked/ nose.

With vacccine efficacy delta dropping low 60% several months, looks like even vaccinating everyone may enough.

Secondly, aware be, therefore is, endemic.

The ‚Äúnew normal‚Äù put cannot exist vaccinations available everyone (that means children 12), happens, abide measures like social distancing mask wearing. 

I welcome new normal. every person ability protected next. then, behavior outside aforementioned measures irresponsible put mildly.

The weird thing spoken quite people told thought cost money. told free, act surprised. probably still haven‚Äôt gotten vaccine. 

I suppose could lying seems like lying themselves. don‚Äôt go get vaccine, justify Covid isn‚Äôt real. like seen interviews ICU nurses tell people dying Covid, still deny Covid real. state fair dude EDC approved 12 year olds US opinions UK scientists. False equivalency. Weak.

Delta understood time huge problem now. understanding variants game changing potential slow, fact Delta first sequenced late 2020 didn‚Äôt even become VOC May (PHE) June (CDC). let‚Äôs pretend rashly poorly made decision time. Hindsight extremely powerful case. they‚Äôre willingly unvaccinated, partially brought themselves. course idiot Desantis requiring masks something people make decisions speaking professionals, backed science, hell mean stupid call?? Thanks! needed chuckle. Given discussion regarding holding exams, thought would duh moment realise state schools running. assumed people common sense Reddit.

If schools running, conducting exams debate

No schools running Kerala I'm sorry. parent younger children especially must scary right now--at least reasobable. 

School started area Monday. Today announced high school going distance learning immediately kids came school sick knowing covid. county lowest vaccination rate state almost one wears masks. needless self centered. mistake...but feel better now... Florida fucked. also.. monoclonal antibodies developed help tests done aborted fetal tissue. top ivermectin used prevent heartworm infections animals.

I ask I'm little worried getting third Moderna booster approved new booster formulation Moderna proposing half original dose. went CVS today, getting original dose, twice amount they're recommending booster. theoretically cause side effects? confirm. entire shift vented patients today ER don‚Äôt space money

""If don‚Äôt meet requirements, regardless age, fully vaccinated. Keep taking fully vaccinated."" probably unvaccinated. biggest issue children pass vulnerable adults. 

Oh, you‚Äôre one people. ‚ÄúCOVID DOESN‚ÄôT AFFECT CHILDREN!‚Äù

You lost credibility every single point you‚Äôve tried make now. 

COVID detrimental effects children even it‚Äôs death. Long covid thing metric must measured. fact choose ignore fact reprehensible. probably years away everybody (including infants) vaccinated. Nobody signing extraordinary measures long.

There likely vaccine 5-12 year olds *this* year. vaccine 2-5 year olds shortly thereafter. 

But please, continue living selfish life can‚Äôt bothered adhere ‚Äúextraordinary measures‚Äù. course mean social distancing mask wearing. difficult.  Zero Covid farce. I‚Äôve saying several months.  Plus developed magnetic super powers like magnetic-yo x-folks. I'm concern trolling, definitely think anyone voluntarily passing vaccines dummy. true vaccinated stop person catching transmitting virus, viral loads lower unvaccinated person, really fair blame case surge unvaccinated? make lot sense me. This. I‚Äôm sick people downplaying vaccines. number 1 way get this. lockdowns. one makes glow black light? want one.. Nothin like rodef Yom Kippur üòí far supposed insert it?  yeah. florida sketchy. It‚Äôs still minority opinion. body scientific evidence majority doctors scientists (who also experts) saying kids get vaccinated. kids, schools country? wonder study fares presence delta variant. causal inspection situation two countries, UAE Israel, shows Chinese vaccines well UAE (the main vaccines using ) whatever vaccines used Israel misfired recently 

UAE charts, daily deaths single charts, daily deaths That's true. I'm female household daughter got married moved out. live husband two sons bet use 90% toilet paper house. 

I last 10 rolls, ordered 32 roll pack Scott toilet paper Amazon day, case. 

I know go stock like last year pandemic started, want take chances. 

Last time, people buying really unreasonable quantities though, like toilet paper never going available again. family friend bought like 250 rolls family 2. controlling delta. disgusting culture USA created companies want destroy opportunity employees experience safety wellness outside office NEVER first place dealing stupid long commutes. forcing children back classroom everyone treats schools like day care facilities. properly funded, another dysfunction American Work-life culture. reality COVID DELTA exposing terrible ideology crafted corporate world. seeing effects greed stupidity. Yeah, ideal world week would end mask mandates measures, many places can't happen.

I cannot stress enough, school board elections almost important national races. happen experts field picked specifically make judgements whether recommend vaccination (and COVID either). Plenty fuckery going on. Opening closing schools could change ratio! case opening schools could let kids get infected faster (lol) shorten wave. meant :) Florida changed way report deaths now, too. can't remember details might want look it. 4th soon. Carry asshats. Yes, hardly matters, since getting consistently outcompeted Delta. country Mu issue, Delta bigger issue. 

Florida provides good example Mu reaching substantial level Mu Delta arrived. Hardly anyone gives shit East Tennessee. 
      
I‚Äôm glad employer making vaccines mandatory. currently 90% vaccinated rest resign get fired next month. Oh, fill exemption forms require lot paperwork proof. kid eligible, I'd same. reduce person person contact, concession stands accept plastic.

Lol... Could obvious ""because COVID"" measure nothing COVID?

I wish someone kept running list last year half number ""COVID safety measures"" really businesses wanting away something like blaming COVID. UGH ... right. following mandates going masked well 2022. :(  4 kids caught covid-19 week class child sent school knowingly positive. 6 year old daughter pretty sick, rest feel grubby headaches upset stomachs. kids came home feeling sick mid morning. sick coughing covid child....stayed. Phase 1s. clarified plan phase 3s (RCTs).

These different. phase 1 recruit people, give booster, measure antibodies maybe B cells. phase 3 actually blind everything look case counts determine actual efficacy. 

We already phase 1s showing boosters absurdly good. [The vaccines work feel parties serve end whole.

That dump-truck load horsehockey. Riddle this: Florida Tennessee right now? Might doable May 14th CDC announcement masks passe.  don‚Äôt last forever. Eventually, viral burn ratchets smolder; disease causes becomes, average, survivable. Vaccines help us tame flames safely putting shields didn‚Äôt exist before. vaccinated world, fewer trees get scorched; fewer flames hop branch branch. immunizations go around, less kindling virus burn.

I wish fear mongering people could understand that.. did, 90% got vaccinated meantime.   Social Media specifically. roles, doesn‚Äôt apply. spend majority work day field home visits, meetings schools, medical visits. Pre-covid spent maybe 2 hours week building really makes sense pay outrageous rent. building isn‚Äôt even large ac/heat never work. think positive needed huge parking lot provide us cars Hello fellow people, two days ago developed scratchy/raw throat, runny nose, sinus pressure, general unwell feeling. I'm fully vaccinated Pfizer. Well, took Binaxnow test I'm confused results. 15 minute mark, checked looked negative, area suspicion. Thought eyes might playing tricks, decided wait another 5-10 minutes check again. looked like this. guys think? things get evaporation lines like pregnancy tests do? says interpret 30   Vaccines work Social media. Period.

When everything read confirms world view would ever change. TV. kinds things saying? better take away churros literally ZERO reason resume ""Normal"" person activities except greed stupidity. Every person brain could see close proximity especially less vaccination amounts going lead spikes.

How idea us following rules believe science punished people don't. agree vaccines mandated masks required indoors, reason things shut unless involve kids young get vaccinated.  Per every square foot small apartment improved air purification several orders magnitude enough badass masks sure I'm spreading shit get infected. 

And local schools right street already news ridiculously high number cases students staff .. two fucking weeks? Lol. 

Instead leadership we've got school boards trying cook ways take (fucking millions $$$ in) ""COVID funding"" simultaneously demanding thing mask requirements students staff. would forego cheap/effective non-medical interventions preventative measures still demand millions funding?

Even us willing wear masks limit social interactions want shit blow lead school closures district wide quarantines. Hell. want miss hour work, much less 7-10 days. 

Today parents area got email saying kids/staff come school confirmed actively infected COVID *if wearing mask*, can't partake extracurricular activities. Delta one infectious respiratory pathogens. Ever. o.g. blue surgical masks going cut it, doubt schools going use actual COVID funding provide highly effective masks students/staff confirmed infections. *Because would make sense*. Want keep parents employed keep kids school? Alright. that's goal going make happen?

Best luck all. Wet wipes at.  Exactly. visited research medical campus June totally shocked see almost everyone without masks. simply said policy require anymore. they're back 100% masks ofc.  I‚Äôm new state, wondering well. I‚Äôm connected deaths, *kid* denied safe learning environment.

It‚Äôs truly well time. know, know, taxpayers end paying, but, imho, need evil mofos gone choosing worse two consequences: sickness death, well raises health insurance medical costs, rest lives vs. bringing villainy account, now.

Where‚Äôs lawyer(s) teachers‚Äô families? gofundme‚Äôs legal fees? Genuinely curious hasn‚Äôt happened? see kids grocery stores malls w/o masks time. parents care protecting kids care protect them...

Keep home. chronic illness know well limits medicine time. I'm sorry rest world learn too. Still, hold hope children's sake. Connecting Chiropractic academically challenged huge reach, bud.

Academia isn‚Äôt everything. I‚Äôm happy mom dad instilled you. Ignorance comes cost though.

The reason discrepancy CDC/KFF race/ethnicity vaccination rates vaccination rate individuals 12 older CDC KFF rely state reporting demographic data, many reported vaccinations include demographic data. example, 63.8% vaccinations reported CDC associated race/ethnicity data. possible (I would say probable) missing CDC KFF demographic data proportional known data (i.e., vaccinations among black people may undercounted among white people). could explain polls show higher vaccination rates black people white people, reported data show opposite.

Prion diseases take many years show. viruses don‚Äôt cause Prion diseases, he‚Äôs talking specifically misfolded proteins nothing else. strong feeling CPS involved now... know, teachers mandatory reporters Get covid avoid getting covid. Yeah, work. Therapeutics. 

That‚Äôs ‚Äúgot past‚Äù AIDS. Yes, it‚Äôs bad. Yes, it‚Äôs still around. 70s, 80s 90s HIV death sentence. medicine people mostly live lives uninterrupted. Plus, find HIV early enough, treatments prevent turning AIDS. Seems like self inflicted wound professions aren‚Äôt vaccinated. Lol no. Beware wilfully unvaxxed conspiracy cattle, Mu variant coming you. large numbers. 2000 people across vaccinated population 170 million. know medication good one illness (e.g. cytotoxic chemotherapy cancer , accutaine acne) might BAD taken another illness (e.g nausea pregnant). Got nasty parasitical infection take ivermectin. covid - Don‚Äôt take ivermectin!!!

Plus also, need believe grown ass adults KNOW eat skin creams/pastes. offense America zero quarantine rules place since last year. Anyone flying in, vaccinated not, requires negative test three days entry. help us variants keep creeping in. Wow. Sell fridge, invest Doge *goddammit* Oh goodness laughed hard comment...thank 50/50 split cost profits? advertise ""luxury"" ""entertainment"", get around pesky medical laws (and protect lawsuit). lotion formulated trusted mixologists course, specific process, cant people trying home Mu too. Could explain numbers? ""as likely"" respect unvaccinated? mean overall? get numbers? Thank you! would like get better deciphering information future. 

(On device seems article paywalled, maybe data there) There‚Äôs also research showing increase bacterial infections vagina women use bidets. got one liked using I‚Äôve reluctant use since reading study :( contagiousness par Delta? Texas schools 130 years without air conditioners. came 1960s.  good doctor friend mine, basically consider genius, insists won‚Äôt able roll variant-specific boosters fast enough without effective therapeutic we‚Äôre real trouble. Uh thanks. 
That makes zero sense, households people risk? 

Shitty logic there... worse kid deal teacher dying?  didn‚Äôt get vaccinated. vaccine free widely available. would also think without vaccines odds new variant spike mutations make vaccine useless increases. Vaccines lowers transmission.... thinking big picture even kids age odds bad reaction virus still exceeds risks taking vaccine Contributory negligence. teachers could gotten free vaccine almost certainly died covid. scary though see fit athlete fully vaxxed getting taken Covid. Makes wonder effective vaccine Delta all. We've touting vaxxed end hospital right? know probably super rare case though suppose going happen....i hope makes decent recovery lungs dont get messed up! good idea. Thank you. Welp mom may given covid.

Amazing comment. bad ton redditors care still get vaccinated.  thank god im flying anywhere long time someone allergy materials masks suggested? wear surgical mask 2 minutes entire area mask touching breaks hives :( MuH CoViD VaRiAnT Yes, yes, absolutely.

However, virus notoriously good antibody evasion. Especially respiratory virus.

The problem isn‚Äôt developing successful antiviral, problem keeping evolution virus. Additionally, antivirals tend pretty hard system / organs.

This studied documented extensively decades worth HIV treatments. Even now, HIV suppression requires mix medications stay ahead evasion. Additionally, certainly needed (and continue need) tinkering.

Furthermore, dismal performance something like Tamiflu also well documented.

\*Sauce:  young naive back then. Well 3 biggest provinces implementing vaccine passports. think us would like passport system long businesses stay open vaccinated continue life. polls shown strong support passports. Guess John Edwards right something 17 years ago. Cost: trip pharmacy half day day feeling shitty. Benefit: winding hospitalized current preliminary data got confirmed got unlucky 10-30% people, now, least check August data comes July look great. winding long covid vaccines reduce risk 50% protection symptomatic infection 30s-70s first two. Kids, good run didn‚Äôt they? viruses like flu really good ‚Äúrecombination,‚Äù happen one person animal gets infected multiple strains time. lucky thing coronaviruses seem bit shit comparison. Oh, will... sign, stage anyway, variant-specific boosters necessary virus become endemic. random person reddit saying experts wrong type stuff we've complaining about, follows narrative gets upvoted instead. ever connect dots *why* dont allow visitors? Facebook banned r/NNN? Source 1) paper linked modelling **incidence rate**, **peak prediction context widespread community spread**, topic discussion hand. Vietnam use modelling incidence rate. use peak prediction context widespread community spread, I'm actually calling complete idiocy, idiotic knowing hospital system would strained prepare it? Like said, total recorded infections Vietnam crossed 500000 create model understand things peak? 

2) peak prediction context widespread community spread that's idiotic, incidence rate modelling. conflating 2 entirely different things: one mathematical tool people make right policies contain eradicate virus, snake-oil originally peddled politicians snake-oil salesmen west open everything middle widespread community spread sake economy instead actually eradicating virus.

3) basis ""peak prediction"" context widespread community cases touted snake-oil salesmen politicians west 1) pseudoscientific take herd immunity without vaccine, 2) wishful thinking virus people probably thought theory evolution unproven hypothesis:

* first international mention peak prediction series advice old Wuhan leaders (who fired year now) back Jan-Feb, advisors told old Wuhan leaders virus ""run course die grow less lethal time else virus run hosts can't survive"". narrative proven wrong old Wuhan leaders followed stupid advice blew Wuhan, proven wrong leaders west followed blew countries, proven wrong third time old HCMC leaders (now fired) followed blew HCMC. Meanwhile, anyone basic knowledge critical thinking and/or natural selection would detect virus brain therefore can't know ""should"" grow less lethal run host (which also false). people backed ""will grow less lethal"" hypothesis reasoned since humanity died yet pandemic, means humanity ever die pandemic ever, make sense all. Furthermore, real life, HIV around decades shown sign weakening all, tuberculosis even longer, there's Black Death almost wiped Europe scores human population/civilizations really wiped real pandemics (i.e. native Americans). ""POV"" virus, there's also nothing distinguish humans forest mice populations routinely wiped diseases. **The virus brain** know ""should"" grow less lethal continue existing. Peak prediction useful used context **ZeroCovid** strategies judge effective eradication policies are.
* Secondly, herd immunity without vaccine idiocy initially created based (blatantly racist, groundless, politically-charged) assumption China underreporting 5 times actual case count. go check early articles back Jan-April posted sub progression herd immunity stupidity. covid hit west snake-oil salesmen changed tune say healthcare systems countries fucking numbers, ""peak prediction"" wrong. snakeoil salesmen, actual numbers always 5 times reported number, **it means secretly everyone community already infected, asymptomatic immune, therefore reached ""herd immunity"", epidemic secretly ""peaked"" would go moment now**! reported number increase ""peak"" proved wrong (last counted ""peak predictions"" wrong around 4 times 2020, hence habit count waves realistically speaking, US never eradicated first ""wave"" first place distinction ""second wave""). true extent, every country miscounting, jumping ""miscounting inevitable"" ""we secretly infected therefore we're magically immune"" leap logic fueled purely wishful thinking (and great amount sunk cost fallacy).
* Thirdly, herd immunity ""less lethal"" hypothesis fundamentally based false premise virus run hosts, which, real life proven wrong several times now. outcome easy enough see world **10 billion** people, that's counting variants, lot world 10 billion potential incubators. Herd immunity useful vaccination discussed.

4) Zero Covid countries use cluster model, wave model. Fundamentally, covid spreads wave clusters, spread highly dependent environmental factors social structure community. Vietnam, despite longer Zero Covid moment, still aiming Zero Covid goal continues cluster model (aside old HCMC leaders used wave model blew HCMC point widespread community spread first place). looked like ""waves"" west people charge trying justify proven false ""peak predictions"". reasonable use waves Zero Covid countries, wave originated different original F0 primary clusters wave, clear cut ZeroCovid space different waves. Even west, modelling covid spread moved wave model cluster model since March year: Yeah honestly I've seen Pfizer Moderna's study effectiveness additional shot, find data countries it. 

The CDC already proven lie risks needs, since purposefully lied effectiveness masks previously. Right vaccine supply plentiful, tons doses still thrown away daily across US. fence getting one early, I'd rather get vaccines plentiful would wasted used, vs everyone going time point getting early might prevent someone else getting dose.   Well, think u anything similar spanish far left US, far right equivalent even lighter ""normal"" right (GOP), apply US makes sense lot anti vaxers (all uneducated republicans).
I'm sharing thoughts, I'm aware know US well enough I'm sorry incorrect offensive. theory confirm/debunk.

That pandemic going endemic pretty clear early middle last year.

The sooner accept adapt, better be. Erm... No. That's typically American response. That's exactly USA violent compared western countries. Everybody thinks guns answer. New variant equal fit virulent infectious. Remember lambda? UK/Canada breakthrough infections compared us? gets outcompeted delta everywhere get strains flu.

They target think 'popular' strains year. Cheap, effective handcuffs, available anyone.  enough prescribe parasite medication corona

You're still acknowledging NIH strong reason believe worth time money effort study ivermectin made expert-sounding statement would absurd think drug parasites could work virus. course, proven treatment (monoclonal antibodies) available,it makes much sense prescribe that. evidence ivermectin is, far, inconclusive, awaits conclusion standard double blind study.

There three published metastudies ivermectin, two showed high certainty strong efficacy. study showed doubtful benefit, still harm shown patients using covid. risk nil. 
Many countries waiting vaccines and, poor countries, monoclonal antibodies likely never option. makes perfect sense doctor Mexico City prescribe ivermectin either prophylaxis treatment. cheap dropped African countries decades risk low. even Japan, Tokyo medical association made open call doctors prescribe ivermectin. See, everything world revolve around US political divisiveness surrounds covid ivermectin.

Even US, monoclonal antibodies always easy get. friend mine sick covid went hospital blood oxygen started dropping. asked antibody treatment said conclusive pneumonia, refused. Two days later diagnosed pneumonia said treatment ""window"" anticlonal antibodies expired day before. person three comorbidities basically left fend himself. certainly understand people trying recover home thinking ivermectin might worth try. Many options, know gets bad hospital might admit them, could late. Ok think means O2 enrichment sulfur plant use. SRU still run, reduced rates. acceptable difficult times. he‚Äôs trying another addition echo chamber? see issue also discussing us vaccinated choosing live normal life. odds extremely favor I‚Äôll fine Covid, continue help idiots don‚Äôt want it?? understand even people vaccinated babies mmr, hepb, tetanus, somehow disinclined take covid vaccine. Even millions taken shows effective safe. reason is? Preventive measures taken considerate intelligent people. assure statistics would look wildly different everyone outlook. little brain power goes long way, sure learned inverse though. I'd love see underlying data. 65 neither obese overweight, percent hospitalizations/deaths folks? I'm guessing less 5%. even allowed talk ways society. kid, eh? ‚Äúkid‚Äù mean opinions ideas, I‚Äôm guessing. tell im screwing around playing solitaire?  Seriously. school *two* kindergarten teachers. here, it‚Äôs DEFF right next Scientology one, 2 banned episodes one macho man Randy savage trans. Also November 2020 lucky enough get taste smell back within week half although good could barley taste steak birthday dinner December mention fatigue lasted weeks shortness breath months. 

Looking back bow I'm pretty sure steak tasted alittle metallic, eggs bacon tasted alittle nothing past.

But l February noticed smell good maybe sinuses super dry ? definitely burning smell covid weird fuck. 

 pepsi noticed tasted like burnt wood chemicals. Coca cola, mountain dew sprite tasted like pretty much drink pop months so.

I figured bad batch something tried another one weeks later thing.

It remained liked awhile I'm pretty sure everything back normal I'm sure simply time getting vaccinated may helped regard. 

My gf lost taste smell 2 months eventually came back.

Pepsi also tasted like crap well tried pretty much joked really like pepsi much coca cola anyways. case nearby country. take get.  COVID patients ICU British Columbia 20 August 9th 118 today.

What capacity matter much potential increase 6-fold 3 short weeks. trajectory needs slowed matter what. 

The ""good news"" almost 100% unvaccinated. totally preventable. 

To answer OP's question, 80% us vaccinated getting along normal lives extent possible (which mostly everything except large indoor events), quickly losing patience remaining 20%. Especially organized massive protest outside hospital places. could foreseen this!? Texas starting sound like Florida. vigilante types zip ties? must buy em bulk know them. kids absolutely feral year. It‚Äôs like didn‚Äôt get parenting shut downs. It‚Äôs mind blowing. natural selection. unbelievably quick. refuse completely safe proven effective vaccine, put another unproven cocktail body? insane.   Thank sir may another variant! Good point I'm sure trim complicated vaccinated. Maybe ""simple"" ""vaxxed."" already Mu?? shit probably deadly virus earth US goes, goes world.

Not unexpected FDA approved vaccines 16 older. honestly believe that? virus lays inside pets zoo animals. think would bump right back community short order spread across globe matter weeks months.

This virus stay. suffer Minnesota winter go back.

Wow like LARP, kids quite imagination.  position provinces risks acceptable long there's limitations placed unvaccinated people protect everyone else. vaccine passport systems for. let people continue living normal lives. Lol sure Follow much barely even collecting breakthrough infection data. mean, Im fully vaxxed, also high risk due autoimmune disease, concerned increasing breakthroughs Delta well simply spreading asymptomatically either catching long covid spreading others increasing likelihood vaccine escape. 

I agree covid stay become endemic, unfortunate world‚Äôs governments (aside China first appeared) take seriously properly try stamp chance. 

Where live, 58% double vaxxed (closer 70% 12+) yet hospitalization rising elective surgeries postponed again. amount cases 10x time year ago. truly feel like never-ending crisis.  one:



the universe: quit.  Honestly, sure anymore. rught wing propaganda, unwillingness follow common sense, new variants. feels like inevitable, whether alpha, delta, mu variant line.

I sure deaths preventable anymore. possibly understand fear, overreact. Even 'evades antibodies' (which highly doubt), immune systems T-cells.

Without anibodies (again doubtful) get infected, immune system still knows virus able get rid much quicker  new dominant strain. RN here. Hopefully daughter get vaccinated soon. Studies ongoing. Rumor street vaccine kids &lt; 12 yrs October. Governor Death Sentence hard work. grew Pensacola. graduating decade ago, moved MN. 

I never back.  ...My entire taste/smell pallet reset since COVID.

All things taste ""off"" smell ""off"". course man. friggin Texas we're talking here.  Time walk out. Get vaccinated! exactly true: FUP got Preparation H ad youtube reading this. Haven‚Äôt seen one decades.  black mirror ship will, get vaccine, live life. fact is, Covid endemic it‚Äôs never going away, like ever, unlike viruses like polio, smallpox, don‚Äôt animal reservoirs, Covid does, it‚Äôs going comeback always, that‚Äôs it‚Äôs also important get shots go live life. odds Extremely favor you‚Äôll fine get Covid vaccine. still 98% effectiveness preventing severe/hospitalizations, always main goal vaccines. Preventing Covid always icing cake. take far greater risks flu vaccines, considering flu vaccines 60% effective most. also implore look Russian flu 1889, interesting speculation it, may point Covid may go future. kept wearing mask consistently vaccinated. I‚Äôve watched enough apocalypse-style movies know never let guard end game. hear you, lot people thought way. It‚Äôs completely normal done considering we‚Äôve through. Double mask. Balaclava + surgical mask.  anyone good scientific explanation surgical masks better? Somehow either never got memo fact millions healthily vaxxed, they're unable process numbers even they're shown them.

Sadly, able focus (vanishingly) rare exceptions and/or suspiciously (to them) rapid development effective vaccines.

Malicious misinformation campaigns play huge role, course. begin wonder whether leaving primary care physicians vaccination efforts may also play major role. Considering individual make ""people"", guess...  wow way anticipated follow science unlike White House. leaders playing voters. power retention, public service. days long gone. Rahxephon intensifies. even stranger example certain way. least getting bombed London...together. mean London Bombing deniers? made likely area got bombed. anti crowd's play quite aggressive think it. really fucking everyone. Weirdly enough fucking worst. Think extra medical bills, long-term health effects, extra days work ultimately get it. Apparently, variants roller along. also suffer politically actions. like huge LOSE-LOSE-LOSE them. really weird draw line sand right worldwide health crisis. I'm wondering is, going use pi skip it? Pi variant sounds kinda nice lol Yep is... read post. guy tells much better ever No, you‚Äôre qualified speak this.

1) persistence HIV body via reservoirs.

2) ability random mutation HIV, aids immune system evasion.

These two different distinct mechanisms make HIV particularly tricky.

I never brought persistence infection. little evidence SARS-CoV-2, wasn‚Äôt related point making. China? Chile gonna vaccinate kids older 3 years October. guessing like project stupid shit others. Go get help then, F off. Peace.  makes whistle real good.

I spit coffee, thanks waiting tell it. conversation happen indoors outdoors? Btw that‚Äôs ONE COUNTY Please let rest us know decide buy stocks dip pre-spike. i‚Äôm tired stay-at-home order may needed, Dworkin said.

HOW? islands open tourists again, hospitality workers can‚Äôt exactly work home. bartenders surf instructors exempted essential workers? exactly supposed stay home #1 industry open business? ‚Äúdoom‚Äù social enjoy going exhausted terrified it‚Äôll never come back way safe dad's work mobile clinic come people could get vaccinated. extra doses left able get one ""employee"" business. happy get one. like huge weight shoulders dad getting vaccinated, especially risk.

I wish everyone felt same. never bad. Yep, tons unvaccinated people studies said main reason getting ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs liberals want.‚Äù People need take solace cases anecdotal outliers. % fully vaxxed patients among covid hospital patients miniscule. manufacturing domestic. adds redundancy supply chain. hoping 2022 better year one, cheering endemic come us sooner. everyone mentality wouldn‚Äôt problem social media causing anxiety depression. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt mind downvotes must come absolute idiots‚Äù? Holy hell. Brilliant! Delta happening pretty much track. mRNA based vaccines focused attack spike protein outer portion virus. reason reason effectiveness went Delta rapidly delta replicates infects body. vaccinated immune system falls behind quickly soon recovers cases resulting less serious infection/symptoms. primary goal vaccine achieved serious infection mitigated part reducing hospitalization deaths.

source: spoken number epidemiologists, virologists doctors try get better understanding vaccines work. they're accumulating data somewhere publicly reported/accessible, seem bad touted previously. actually seems like accurate way report, long cumulative numbers day easily found (which may issue is). lot times seeing one day's numbers weekend tank, next spikes 2x average was, missing day's numbers. decision? Sorry, see anything wrong taking money fool. going piss away anyways, may well go family.

It's get real bad here. saying people dumb make choices? best remove options except one?

Weird argument man....  actually referring recommendation vaccinate children 12 approval comes through? That‚Äôs different you‚Äôre saying, it‚Äôs closest find. Yes, can't hardly wait Omega Strain. sounds like ends well. ""wahhh want travel dangerous phase pandemic far""

It‚Äôs literally CDCs page right there, done NIOSH. really get much better that, whatever. kids go home, adults well, well, capitalism. vaccinated birth

If could, they'd probably un-vaccinate themselves. least California, digital vaccine pass QR code completely separate paper card. Shouldn‚Äôt enough? 

Only EUDCC system updated recognize QR codes Flu shot effectiveness like 30% range. profound covid vaccines high effectiveness begin with. mRNA based vaccines look promising going forward. almost end game kill anyone elderly unhealthy.

Ive seen lot discussion vaccination rates race/ethnicity US, I'm curious know it. tried compile state reported data recent national polls issue. included Hispanic, white non-Hispanic, black non-Hispanic, since seems discussion focused.

#Single-dose vaccination rates race/ethnicity

|Demographic Consult 12 NBC, Morninig Consult, Civiqs polls adults

* NBC poll conducted Aug 14-17, 2021

* Morning Consult poll conducted Aug 17-23, 2021

* Civiqs poll Sep 2, 2021 (not sure date range represents)

* CDC KFF demographic data missing many vaccinations. case CDC, 63.8% vaccinations associated race/ethnicity data.

* CDC KFF data include states report race/ethnicity data.

* CDC KFF data appear total population, adjusted numbers using estimated 2019 population data US Census Bureau available calculated rate a*r/b total population given demographic group, r vaccination rate given CDC KFF, b population 12 years age older given demographic group.

It seems like missing CDC KFF demographic data could biasing results unkowable ways. Morning Consult poll also gives different picture NBC Civiqs polls, especialy vacination rate among black people. One thing accounted [huge difference age distributions wonder much age differences could account differences vaccination rates race/ethnicity.

Does anyone information topic? thoughts this? Depends live

Here NZ genetically test every single person Covid check (helps us know breaks come from, they're connected, etc).

In kand free... cdc deem special enough worth testing. Good stuff! know work, seems rare case this, yea mean going happen everyone celebrity post haha! nice recovery took half day. I'm starting feel normal 4 weeks dose 2. know norm, isolated case either.

I repeat, currently see clear evidence side-effect risks 3rd dose outweight benefits increased immunity healthy 20-50 year olds.

This becomes especially true consider

 - group received 2nd dose recently, 6-9 months ago like high-risk groups boosters currently recommended

 - risk infection even close 100% within next year (looking past data, probably like 10%-ish), point might better vaccines, vaccines improved tolerability. Nurse here.

This. Is. All. So. Predictable.

A braindead monkey could see mile exactly would happen sort situation. politicians profit placating ignorance idiotic base. base would rather children die believe mask mandates vaccinations needed one worst global pandemics last century. Yeah CDC follows science well advised public face coverings prevent spread COVID provide actual benefit, definitely go buy them.

CDC months later: April fools dawg, might misrepresented facts, fret, everyone's benefit. 

Also CDC: people saying masks work, trust us say effective? I've considered reaching employer, main concern nursing home rural area majority people share sentiments her. I'm afraid reporting result anything &amp; I'll probably get laughed it. Anti vaxxers anti maskers Lmfao even cops, doctors, paramedics, firefighters gotta social distance?

I just...cant anymore. Like, even try sort meaningful discussion people?? Oh guy 3 close family members get COVID, another immunocompromised family member, 3 kids rely him. Yet he's willing put trust animal formulation Ivermectin recommended Youtube video shit... want give comfort indeed work - however panacea. People get idea vaccines stop everything dead person even gets infected something - builds defence next time encounter kick ass. unfortunate virus comes like champ.

I've watching daily numbers Ontario, Canada (I'm BC, Canada daily numbers include who's vaccinated, etc, get weekly only).

Anyhow, majority people fully vaccinated. 76.72% people age 12.

So, looking effectiveness, trailing week (a week good amount data versus day blip either way), cases 5.89x higher unvaccinated people correct population difference.. take vaccinated people, divide number cases it, multiply large number readable, unvaccinated. 5.89x higher means vaccine 83% effective preventing illness. That's pretty good. super. good enough aside hermit interacts noone ever.

As ICU cases, per million, Ontario 103 unvaccinated people 8 partial 12 fully vaccinated people ICU. Corrected proportions, unvaccinated person 24.91x likely end ICU vaccinated person. means vaccine 96% effective keeping ass place stick tubes you. Noone likes tubes.

That's pretty damn good. getting sick - yeah sucks, hope mild case end long covid problems... keeping ICU key.

Note data stratified age either know vaccines work great 80+ year old people due lack naive t-cells program, god knows 12 vaccinated people ICU senior citizens not.`  antibodies, class 3 NAbs still able bind it. explained various mutations another comment another user pointed mutation allows immune escape important compared mutations variants interest result significant escape.   36 variants recorded far.

Yeah, India less 15 percent vaccination coverage June. course people think potential headaches we're experiencing breakthrough. Globally, already transmissive variants like Alpha even single mutations like D614G last summer (2020), like news regards higher transmission. Similarly midwest vaccination percentage June (mostly) particularly encouraging either, would anyone surprised virus still spreading, especially another variant? course going spread world.

I feel need debunk this, specifically. crucial fact variant gains prevalence particular region mean going take globally. Look P.1, everyone losing fucking minds earlier year Brazil Manaus outbreak, yet P1 never took globally Delta has. Beta variant SA. competed ancestral strain attain global dominance Delta has. Ancestral strain + D614G (which never got name) took globally July 2020, again, like seen before. 

**We ability predict variants concern become global monsters basically already happening.** Yes, India got fucking pummeled Delta, period basically vaccine coverage, naturally raise concern Delta might evade vaccines. Besides, time, promulgated (by lots smart scientists researchers people listen respect) certain percentage, immunity would quash outbreaks, _certain parts country_ already 70 percent (the coverage number previously touted) June, areas move rolling back restrictions? god's sake, nationally respected doctors scientists said prudent. Again, hindsight.

I also state record, never (even months ago) said places low vaccine coverage relax rules. Highly vaccinated areas only. 

All due respect theory narrative hold reality situation time. hindsight, agree relaxing rules may best move, again, pretend like time wholly bad decision. current knowledge Delta, made quite lot sense. breakthrough case resent tied people. I'm leading ""I COVID vaxxed"" ugh Good you. People whole lotta shock end long covid. It‚Äôs underplayed it‚Äôs unpopular. shit gonna bite. hospitals near capacity people legitimately using say COVID here. 

I tried contacting site haven‚Äôt answered. I‚Äôm sure else do. Better late never, seriously.

Hoping kid(s) stays well mess. bought respirator mask wear now.nobody FL wears masks instead worry protecting potential spread I'm protecting self . best offense good defense. People look like I'm crazy fuck it. Floridians stupid mask 20k plus cases day. complain death rates low. low becauE hospitals whelmed yet. max cap reached thousands going die. hate state people. Friends mine (a couple) visited Florida recently, vaccinated. higher risk (heart stent). started show symptoms, got tested there, ""lost"" results (?). decided drive rather fly home 14+ hours case contagious, GF car 2 hotel rooms days. never showed symptoms. finally got tested got back positive negative. He's treated fine, illness pretty mild.

So bunch possibilities. One never got it, got mild symptoms notice, went away time got back, test false negative. Overall would say affects everyone differently. ? parents say already damage kids. Nom nom nom Class action lawsuit. What? feel this! youngest sick able vaxxed stressing (9). doctor thinks may gastro he‚Äôs getting tested tomorrow responsible parent it‚Äôs right thing do.

He started vomiting bit got congested spiked short lived 101 fever (thank god).

The vomiting stopped day developed cough we‚Äôve able manage far. He‚Äôs fever free 1.5 days.

I hope, anxiety sake, test comes back negative I‚Äôm tired talking people. common sense mask helps reduce spread. see around you. think starts next civil war.  Yeah I‚Äôll hold getting delta new model right around corner think fallen far, paying attention last several years :( can‚Äôt get tested, can‚Äôt positive. family vaccinated, except kids 12. family dinner weekend inside unmasked. kids aren‚Äôt going. say respect decision tell think extreme.

I think think getting Covid okay, probably fine. 

My goal, however, get Covid kids get Covid, even though vaccinated.

My mind starting shift compare variants scenario life flu. Half society probably so-so virus‚Äô vaccine, others took yearly. least certain anti-viral treatments (Tamiflu) prescribed diagnosed early enough. feel something similar comes Covid **FDA approved** may reach similar time March 2020.

Doubtful diagnosed quick need said treatment people usually part ‚Äúwait see‚Äù crowd usually wait long end ICU bed. Ima Gedda Rona   Nah man, anything nasty frat house gave immune system extra workout gains addition vaccine. Masks required proof vaccination not. 

As long places take approach never going get pandemic. Absolutely ridiculous vaccines mandated attendance events like (not criticism you, commenting general places hosting events).  think bit soon say this. saw really cool set graphs day indicated may may correct here. graphs idk like 100 countries broke % cases country different variants time. could clearly see pattern original covid getting overwhelmed Alpha variant, got overwhelmed Delta variant whenever showed country. many different countries look at, clear patterns happening occurred.

There countries Mu variant look at, present still extremely early time see real pattern sort. saw one made bit concerned Mu may starting outcompete Delta, couple ambiguous whether actually happening not.

tl;dr: Mu may may worse Delta, soon say either way.

And count people die icu beds arefull unvaxed covid patients. Omg CACKLING  sounds plausible. fact De Santis liar probably want advertise policies killing kids. one preferred bachelor's, Cambridge Proofreading uses skills based test. believe pay $20/hr, ask minimum 10,000 words week (proofing, writing) work many hours like IIRC. quit job March boss asked return office fully vaccinated yet. filed UI/PUA/PUEC appeal twice since voluntarily quit, ultimately approved got backpaid. worth filing quit finding another position (assuming attribute quit COVID way, might creative, asked reward is... grand might make feel better) idea stop vaccinating. idea vaccinate people need vaccine. think known. Last time TWiV, said exact composition known guess *folded*. uks wave support all. peak, plateaud two thirds peak come yet. carry high caseloads winter, it'll disaster. We‚Äôre vaccinated? 1. governors general, Republican governors specifically

2. They're shit reason fucking obstinate contrarian everything science, extension, Democrats, recommending public safety measures, maintain support troglodyte base.

Kids happen collateral damage. already knew stop caring kids minute they're born so... medical-grade cloth masks 3 layers protection. They‚Äôre certified university entity. lot cloth masks shitty. remember *Adidas* brand ‚Äòmasks‚Äô saw last year. complete joke.  seemed triggered something said. Definitely misinterpreted point.

I never said unvaccinated kids entitled education indiscriminately.

With said probably punish children decisions made parents.

My point long democracy stands Italy would sugges Italians support it. believe democracy stand agreement lol need feel rattled. Masked? Cue Loki theme Sorry, comment might caused misleading. meant preventing symptomatic cases. know it‚Äôs effective Illness. I‚Äôll edit make clearer

I plenty discussions health parents childhood. one decided whether something not.

So, yes, child might legally allowed make decisions. mean cannot partake decision making. can‚Äôt figure yourself? vaccine breakthrough case, would big news. pledge class somehow turned two doctors‚Ä¶ also get 12 year old stressed COVID.

Because lack imagination (and missing braincells) let give example thoughts might float 12 year old's head covid could make anxious 

* Kids going hospital. Could go hospital?
* Could give siblings could go hospital?
* wearing mask right? secretly killed took quick sec eat/drink?
* right, could kill teacher?
* say even old people get vaccinated still go hospital. want make grandparents go hospital.
* throat tickles, covid??
* hear class stay home half class caught covid
* heard one kid got fine, except can't taste anything hates it
* keep hearing people's parents thr hospital vents. parents vaccinated, know whose parents aren't. want hurt friend's parents.

I could keep going, lot 12 year stressed covid. 12, living bubble disconnected society. many ways fears overblown ways not, 12 way know. know adults around concerned scared, probably too.   wonder people formerly blood clots, Factor V Leiden (increases risk blood clots) may conflated news AstraZeneca, vaccines used US. That's main way could believe someone legitimately hesitant getting shot choose specific vaccine.

Philosophically criticize quoting Peart's ""Free Will"", sure. Psychologically think lot hesitant folks actually avoidant. Afraid needles, disease, even going hospitals clinics. point procrastinate taking action. There's lot medical humanities work delves cultural context avoidance. main, criticizing vaccine hesitant harshly get change minds, talking avoidance does.  No? 67% symptomatic, Pfizer Moderna 98% effective preventing severe/hospitalizations. situation nurses people caring Covid patients vaccination widespread wear n95 mask consider wearing safety goggles face shield. Pain ass work like that? much chance getting seriously sick doses roughly 6 weeks time becomes low. didn‚Äôt say wasn‚Äôt? Totally underrated comment :-) really want know much COVID-19 paying Florida. Florida politicians seem hellbent everything stop it. Delta contagious, also, US large number vaccinated people, likely live community people vaccination status. places getting hit hardest covid places lowest vaccination rates. antivax in-laws live Florida, everyone got it. family NY, everyone vaccinated been, one person beginning, we‚Äôve stayed covid free. I'm wondering going keep shaving 1% get every time new variant surges. Diminishing effects that, that's insignificant amount people. 1. going past this. 

2. minors 16 makeup small portion uinvaccinated : think selfish put 16s risk heart side effects vast majority unvaccinated 18-59. Germany example, 20 million unvacccinated adults vs 4,5 child individuals.

4. see enough studies vaccinating children. right exists. Called right work. want right talk openly income co workers without fear consequence management. See DeSantis? Even Alabama sense Florida. BLOOD ORGY!!!

HAAAAAAIL SATAN. Yes, I'm teacher Florida mess, although district one ones required masks anyway. shame usually systematic plan quarantined kids would out. heard people know recently changed mind vaccine getting Covid losing loved one it.

I really wish would take getting burnt virus believe science get damn vaccine. wait /s It‚Äôs like we‚Äôre living real like outbreak movie besides know vaccine released. can't legally make medical decisions.  Kids course many opinions make decisions health time. getting from? provide documents studies regarding that? Covid outbreaks soon named way hurricanes.  must well-founded risk-benefit assessment tells good idea really it.

Care provide examples openly available vaccines risk-benefit assessment doses comes ""you really it""? get vaccinated lot diseases travel lot work (academic fieldwork) need keep shots documented. lost documentation, I'd need shots redone long shots once, I've clearly told doctors specialising travel medicine (I know term exists English, Polish ""medycyna podr√≥≈ºy"") repeating shots getting boosters sooner official documentation says fine hurt health. statement directly opposed told healtcare professionals - ones specialising vaccinating people! can't remember state level federal, laws saying can't sue made work person contacting covid Ohio weird. counties &lt;20% vaxxed counties 75% fully vaxxed. toilet paper house becomes status symbol I‚Äôm going irritated re-shingle next-door neighbors roof along couple friends exchange 72 roll pack toilet paper 2020 refused again. getting ridiculous  article say mask/vaccine refuser breakthough infection passed somebody else was.  clear, told take it. get it, child cannot make medical decisions. much less stressed, anxious happier.

I also get 12 year old stressed COVID. whole situation fucking terrifying, even worse story posted local news station‚Äôs FB majority comments *favor* this! Three men threatened woman confined space zip ties prevented leaving, think acceptable reaction asking kid stay home exposed COVID!

What going country?? Well, efficacy infection Astrazeneca 60% Pfizer 80%. 

Even considering waning immunity, Delta herd's immunity threshold 88%, means 88% population **immune**, vaccinated. looks like even vaccinating entire population actually reaches HIT. know work practice, enough stressing hospitalizations: Crohns list illness etc can‚Äôt take vaccine. fact considered part early group receive vaccine list receive boosters officially. Either persons doctor date guidance person lying/using excuse get vaccine. Quite people assumed couldn‚Äôt get vaccine past vaccines without realizing difference mRNA vaccines. amount people can‚Äôt take vaccine small list extremely rare allergies active cancer treatments. went nought... front beginnings, however, vaccination rate sky high begin 56% entire population early Q2/2021, missing lot adults due lot antivax people (those communities rather large Israel). Ask Republican military already mandated covid vaccines among absolute shitload others, individual members zero legal right capability refuse sue contract signed. anyone pushes far gets dishonorable military better without anyway. suspect article attempting downplay magnitude difference antibodies (neutralizing titers SARS-CoV-2) third dose mRNA vaccine. 

Pfizer's booster trial's initially published data found comparing difference peak/largest amount antibodies dose #2 taken (usually occurs 1-2 week dose), amount antibodies  8 months dose #2 less 20% original peak/largest amount antibodies. 8 months coincidentally current suggested time wait getting booster.

Now getting 3rd dose, study showed count antibodies rose 2000% low point found 8 months, compared dose #2 peak, still rose around 400% more. 

Now obviously guaranteed getting 400%/2000% boost antibodies prevent infection symptoms, studies correlating level antibodies/titers seriousness symptoms. Higher number titers correlates less severity even asymptomatic. 

I would guess article pushed poorer countries prioritized getting first vaccinations wealthier countries give boosters world health org asked. 

I can't speak states, SC couple hospital systems report number COVID cases break vaccinated vs unvaccinated. numbers I've seen past couple weeks consistently reporting close 10% hospitalized vaccinated aka breakthrough, around percentages COVID patients ICU ventilators .

Here numbers largest hospital system reported 09/03:

[Prisma Health COVID breakout   | Total | Vaccinated | Unvaccinated
---------------|-------|-------------|---------------
Hospitalized | 500  | 47 (9.4%) | 453 (90.5%)
In ICU  | 116  | 10 (8.6%) | 106 (91.4%)
On Ventilator| 68   | 6 (8.8%) | 62 (91.2%) Babe wake like America make workplace injury claim infected work due irresponsibility employer? even basic PPE required that? Depends entry requirements, social distancing measures local incidence rate, maybe layout cinema well.

Usually I'd go long either social distancing proof test/vaccine. Netherlands social distancing (1.5m/5ft) now, weeks may switch proof test/vaccine via QR code smartphone.  Harsh probably fair Surely, COVID grant rights vaccinated? You‚Äôre immune either way. Denmark, get COVID pass if: 

- vaccinated
- COVID
- test negative (valid 72hrs) Stop going emergency rooms anti vaxxers science inside. 67% good, definitely stop cases climbing restrictions though. Without vaccines, cases would climbing even faster  Pfizer incredibly effective severe illness death. No, him. propose start using Pokemon exhaust Greek alphabet. gives us 860+ name options covered...  am. Another variant? delta already kicking country‚Äôs ass  yeah, could actually use line ""I alpha omega, beginning end"" lmfao Mutwo Anything causes sterility. I've actually got randoms questions

So school site cops even security acting school resource officers? 

What would citizen actually ""citizen's arrest"" someone?

How two people parents get school?  I'm casual observer noticed lot people around FL home test kits - could reason decline (non-hospitalized) case count? Maybe go back Tidepods.  Simpsons I've found really helpful take break news, especially covid. News tends negative that's gets clicks. find becoming negative. I'm dreading Andromeda Strain. I‚Äôm guessing role model young men either macho enthralled conspiracy theories get vaccinated. [archive link anyone trouble accessing article say were, wanted word opposite virtue signalling.I care , world insane. feel children lost parents caregivers. people know extremely different. 

But think lot people thinking come back work going back regular life. Give months commuting doubt numbers change.  based in-depth medical knowledge course. Vaccinated people ones crowding hospitals.  Actually lollapalooza turned spreader event. also use sick time kids get sick, lot teachers children young vaccinated. Bc teachers get little PTO, they‚Äôll quickly end going unpaid leave territory. dips beneath lazers, ohhwaaohh bet dad felt way guys heard Ligma strain? crazy thing antivaxers question far go get Thier point across? already instances pharmacist destroyed moderna vaccines, others replaced vaccine saline. 
I find events disturbing feel additional safety measures need put place. indeed?

I've read elsewhere uk hospitals 3/4 unvaccinated, imagine 3/4 lower. virus burn unvaccinated. 

The US numbers fluffed unvaccinated crowd. 
Israels numbers already. families aren‚Äôt going test, aren‚Äôt going disclose.

Believe get parents stuck shit situation that's reason offer testing want it. reason test teachers.

The fact perfect reason try all. agree. main benefit vaccination kids 12 right probably avoid quarantine. either get vaccinated end quarantine policies. Otherwise continue endless quarantine cycle.

A lot districts banking kid vaccines ticket forth year disruption.  Smallpox deadlier, Delta appears [have terms transmissibility I'd definitely asking mom's doctors Reddit. someone explain downvotes one?

Anti vaxxers? Racists? Assholes? feel uncomfortable living state that's dumber Alabama. ridiculous false equivalency presented.

National speed limit reduction cause annoyance. would grind private public transportation nearly halt sink general productivity therefore majorly impact economy.

Masks zero impact individual's productivity. fact, reducing viral spread, actually produces net gain keeping people working home sick hospitalized.

And yes, countries able control infection rates much better us...mostly due strict lockdown efforts. See Australia New Zealand.

If like mirror tactics, assume supportive another lockdown? Get ready r/PublicFreakout next week show hundreds ""patriots"" beating shit kid's teachers... It‚Äôs literally total cases/vaccinated cases. don‚Äôt know mean numbers it‚Äôs pretty simple see breakthrough 22% dataset 30% LA. don‚Äôt know causes know least 3 symptomatic breakthroughs friend group, although symptoms weren‚Äôt worse flu. Texas making headlines wrong reasons! think point I'd hold tight, assuming 12-40 years old generally good health. data necessity boosters mixed official go ahead US seems likely road. may take time agree language.

In countries boosters seem likely limited. I.E. jurisdictions allowing Canada mixed series AZ + mRNA vaccine avoid future headaches international travel. statements health bodies seem suggest efficacy booster needs evidence outside elderly immunocompromised. It‚Äôs definitely sarcasm Good luck! took appropriate dose appropriate application, little worry about. Ivermectin safe drug used intended purpose, becomes dangerous taken extended period time doses exceeding prescription guidelines. 

Excitotoxicity really one thing, possible describe single observable effect. experience excitotoxicity vary depending type cell. Broadly speaking, result cell remaining activated dying due overuse. good example methamphetamine, cause brain damage overstimulating monoamine neurotransmitter cells. cells essentially burn out, leaving brain less responsive natural signaling. lot vaccinated people died covid well That's way understood it. Recombination events ""can"" happen, they're super rare covid. Shocking That‚Äôs world right now, people can‚Äôt take 1 minute google see it‚Äôs illegal tell patients variant  company pay people track that, still run shitty people like think skills makes special. boyfriend got covid fully vaxxed. symptoms mild though think done scared virus. Trust vaccine, protect you. Meanwhile TN Knox county school board emergency meeting due covid, substitutes left, teachers sick, hundreds students sick. meeting requiring masks... One school board members slept thru whole meeting, woke up, cast vote deny mask mandate, left. data pain ass analyse they're presented comparably, UK US similar overall case rates per capita moment 0-18 age group UK seems roughly 170 hospital admissions per week, adjusted US population 900 per week. contrast US seeing 330 per day 2300 per week.

The US situation even skewed 12-17s eligible full vaccination while, whilst impact vaccination age group UK much lower large majority eligible, large majority eligible recently become eligible, 16 17 year olds eligible one dose. using comparable patients I'd guess hospitalisation rate triple US.

Using better data, cumulative covid death rates children US double UK despite similar covid deaths per capita, date info. Well kills ""don't trust news"" ""don't trust government"" ""don't trust [spokesperson]"" drug like hydroxychloroquine ivermectin touted discredited scientist jump secret solution. yes definitely trust FDA trust Egyptian doctor never heard of. maybe I'm missing something look [data linked report lists 218 cases myocarditis 3,735,660 patients &lt;16 age bracket.

If assume *all* 218 cases result COVID-19 (which probably case) still gets 0.0058% less 0.006% figure quoted vaccine.

I'm certain there's since get actual bracket ages 12-15 rather lumping together everyone 16. Also gender seems factor. local paper... I‚Äôm streaming Covidify, u? definitely went heard Joe Rogan it.

Good job Texas Thanks, wish I'd seen lost hour sleep worrying Mu.  getting fucking ridiculous. HAPPY Pharma companies right now.

Why arent treating virus like flu already Okay, difference choice. But, want work here. conditions employment. There‚Äôs that. parents would consent children tested, right? kids get sent home, what? Alabama worker protections place anymore bc federal mandate paid quarantine ran out. lot single parent families struggling make rent. can‚Äôt afford take week unpaid leave stay home kids. families aren‚Äôt going test, aren‚Äôt going disclose.  Sorry trying dense following. another table shows ""Percent Cases Vaccinated"" per month 8.27% July 4.84% August nowhere near 22%.

Even percentage cases vaccinated, breakthrough rate, thing. Overall, however, percentages vaccinated people test positive, hospitalized die Covid remain low ‚Äî less 1%. nearly 5.15 million fully-vaccinated county residents Tuesday, 27,331 tested positive. That‚Äôs rate 0.53%.

Also, far side effects, might realistically prepared feel well day. got common side effects, feel wiped chills restless night. However, way better even cold around 12 hours, whereas even cold feel bad week.

As far vaccine, three choices. would personally recommend Pfizer you, probably best one get default. Moderna protects COVID chance side effects. Johnson Johnson still great vaccine far better nothing really want one done I'd recommend it. However, likely protect well, dangerous side effects though mainly young women, worst there's lack data less understanding best proceed forward.

So, bad people don‚Äôt want vaccine? able obtain herd immunity comes personal risk, hurting anyone else. Anyone tell want hear. bad feeling going age well... jesus! right, companies business inquiring customers medical history.

But breath company every right check anyone willing use business falls within policies whilst property.

If people like it, simple. use business.

I always found funny people say rights ever want do, companies want use right want properties... bloody murder  variant *is new strain* though.

You OG covid, you‚Äôd variants, strain. variants spawn variants, etc. strain sequence Variants whose path followed basically. new variant co-exists original unmodified one, branching new strain.

One things I've noticed there's huge variability antibody levels even people got vaccine time.

This sucks. worst part knowing tomorrow bring.....better? worse? 
Kind feel alone too. husband seems like he's scared death me.....but he's anti vaxxer. Kind funny way. Scared little poke arm, terrified me. Maybe , eventually, figure can't win unless get brave fight battle. happen California there's QR code download acts digital vaccination card. sure places this. 93% people UK already form immunity, they're close, already endgame. equating forced abortion infanticide compulsory vaccination? 

Now, ‚Äúmake life inconvenient get shot‚Äù camp. don‚Äôt think military enforcement realistic would likely cause turmoil already super fragile civil... relations. 

But can‚Äôt see level as, say, hysterectomies forces detainees US. Bodily autonomy important every level participate society engaged social contract‚Äîprotection government exchange liability. Unvaccinated people currently liability, something give.

Either get vaccinated triage becomes lot cutthroat. remember back April became eligible vaccine. went one mass vaccination sites crowded everyone super nice walked happy thinking Covid done. Poor, stupid me. One could also read long covid symptoms present without covid. E.g. people issues pop time time trials boosters are, ever planned be, run

Wait, what? read booster trials recruiting participants? Here's population question literally population US, it‚Äôs going change numbers. don‚Äôt know you‚Äôd look help there. 

But think philosophical distinction approach actually interesting. you‚Äôre saying, best understand, think Covid isn‚Äôt impactful enough justify regulation, think it‚Äôs perfectly fine require vaccinations? level risk transition occur?

I known people took position drunk driving speeding entirely legal, laws exist around actually realized consequences, ie actually caused accident. 2019 World Military Games hosted Wuhan October 2019. wonder could traced back that?

Now. 

That's massive move. 

And rest south catch northeast quickly trends massively shift. 

And I'm absolutely using deaths push narrative ""get fucking vax mask fuck up.""

Why pushing old data south fire covid? 

What narrative serve? appreciate it, really do. trying 18months. 

Ive heard sympathy/empathy discussion, resiliency talks corporate ""attaboy""s, me, rightly described compassion fatigue.  Compassion fellow human beings draws mighty deep well, though certainly infinite. increasingly difficult feel compassion someone whose actions, choices behaviors decreasing probability collective survival. 

Ive always said 'I wont cynical old ER nurse due patient care, due corporate slave status professional colleagues."". ive certainly become cynical lately.  prescient observation cynicism grown gap rhetoric reality. Lol leave Asians euphemism **No**, nothing says vaccine 50% effective long covid. 

It cuts ~10% chance longterm illness (your number, iirc) ~5%. 

Again, 50% is, fact, substantial. get sick die, set go fund me... Meanwhile, universal healthcare asking handout, they're long they're healthy. Internal surveys done company mean shit. company sent email according witch majority workers work office, set conference details work. came Q&amp;A common question was, according survey people done survey. Changing minds vaccines Covid seen siding liberals they‚Äôll loose surviving conservatives voters support.    Miami-Dade school mask mandate. work oilfield know company Texas talked employees (truckers) taking shit. mom RN Idaho. Thankfully doctor's office hospital. saying Covid flowing staff rate previously seen, mostly unvaccinated also vaccinated. almost entirely people kids 18.

She says spread community also much worse local news reporting still patients fighting wearing mask hour half long appointments her. agree however... expect sacrifice right admission public events services. freedom (not ‚Äúyou‚Äù specifically, hypothetical ‚Äúother‚Äù) ends begins infringe freedom infected deadly virus, particularly two unvaccinated kids. Deaths per million, 100k however want break give figure.

You can't take two numbers make argument. must make comparison either side.

Almost coworkers friends completely given masking/distancing gone vacation florida :/  real world data becoming much easier measure two effects entirely separately. therefore essential remember combine get final comparisons.

Vaccinated (2-dose mRNA) people are:

* 20% likely catch COVID

* 30% likely hospitalized (6% overall)

* 50% likely long covid (90% overall)

* ??? less likely transmit COVID others (&lt;20% overall) cool. one sounds like crappy one. I'm guessing see lot reality. Sorry confusion. exaggerating. go outside walks stuff, places indoors lots people like yourself. Yeah, would nice never get it, think that's possible anymore. I'll keep trying, though, I'll probably get little adventurous cases drop like months ago. nice months things almost felt normal again.  ever safe go back opinion? vaccine available kids 12? question? Nope, Texas! sad state affairs specify *which* dipshit governor involved. I‚Äôm tired. parents go home eventually. U know right wish fear mongering people could understand that..

Who fearmongering strawmen deny that?  dunno, might seen empathetic experts stressing results shouldn‚Äôt interpreted discouragement vaccinating. Immunologist Prof. Cyrille Cohen Bar Ilan University, involved study, told Times Israel: ‚ÄúCertain people inclined get vaccinated might mistaken think means you‚Äôd better get sick priori get vaccine. thinking medically wrong, results study mean people expose purpose get ‚ÄúAs disease, much safer get vaccine prevent COVID-19, disease puts one risk hospitalization, death long-running after-effects.‚Äù number 1 way get this. lockdowns.

And said otherwise?

Quite strawman. even triple negatives optimal headline drama be. Montgomery ISD, example, 1 20 people confirmed actively infected instead advertising football games new website twitter. Unfortunately :( kids vaccinated. still need effective treatments. happens communities approach 100% vaccination

That happen long we're vaccinating young, now, experts advising that. That‚Äôs long, gotten lung infection/pneumonia high school didn‚Äôt feel sick extreme shortness breath nasty almost whooping cough would come nowhere. took months feel fairly normal I'm fear next variant keep going may right around corner.

Went busy CVS, asked shot, got it. Shot #3 felt like shot #2 - similar low fever/aches/chills. Better next day. Would needed. 

Would reconsidered taking shot alway someone needed it, logistics aren‚Äôt place get extra Pfizer local pharmacy another county vaccination rate area stagnant. we're happy condemn *at least* 2% children long (does end?) covid? % children risk pfizer jabs? George Carlin right. Politicians give damn you.  hold hope children never get sick immune systems trained prevent it. Hoping magical chemical discovered kills one one possible protein chain pipe dream. Even best case, treatments administered narrow time window, cannot match effective vaccines. Where'd article say they're afraid masks?  assuming this? psychology works like this: take dad, always embarrassing around social situation, introduce lots like minded embarrassing people. first time lives part herd likeminded people can‚Äôt wait start every morning socially unacceptable accepted. exposure vaccinated also increase future defense? violates provider agreement site giving vaccine outside EUA BLA. means government could stop shipping vaccines. importantly, liability protection PREP act recipient covered injury vaccine causes. insurance company deny payment site administration vaccine.

I‚Äôm camp ‚ÄúYeah, I‚Äôm fully vaccinated, I‚Äôd prefer get Covid all‚Äù. 

It‚Äôs often claimed everyone get inevitably get eventually. even that‚Äôs case, delaying long possible could still highly beneficial. finally get it, could protected booster that‚Äôs super-effective second generation vaccine. breakthrough infection could mean small patch cells nose infected immune system curb-stomps virus. Whether vaccines *that* effective, you‚Äôll likely also access Covid anti-viral pills start taking soon test positive, stifling infection quickly. Biden administration already committed 3 billion development drugs, seems lot optimism project. measures would likely greatly reduce risk getting Long Covid, hopefully we‚Äôll also much better understanding mechanisms behind it, prevent and/or mitigate it. able taste smell would pretty serious me. Good food one things kept sane whole thing. lost that, know would do. Lol. Wut? 3 weeks ago hit Costco big time. comparing graphs last year year. area reporting 9x cases week. (Small rural town hour Twin Cities)

I think could eat fairly well 6 months keep body home clean. Totally makes sense. scientific evidence ivermectin (slim) points either harmless giving slight benefit COVID taken early disease progression. harmful people taking horse-sized doses, (mostly) pushed alternative vaccines (which potential treatment could never be). Florida straight changed reporting inaccurate. Death likely lot higher reporting. Well, that's just, like, opinion, man Absolutely true. pandemic started, coworker flu came work. asked could work home. manager said no. made uncomfortable past history workplace offices people get sick, often spreads like wildfire. Sure enough, that's exactly happened. turn contract flu. took couple days office worked home, still attending meetings performing duties usual. manager started badgering coming office. told sick want infect anybody further. okay couple days, kept badgering come back office unacceptable work home. Keep mind, even taken proper sick day working home entire time. course, wanting lose job, went back office nobody's surprise, people got sick me. Fast forward 2020, entire office moved remote. Suddenly, people problem working remotely. Covid quite possibly best wake call highlighting American workplace poor practices. unlikely get serious symptoms vaccinated :) make sure get booster available, wear masks reduce spread, otherwise use worrying. get saying punishing vaccinated people telling need go back full blown quarantine living way things. got vaccinated April, I'm going getting booster probably fall, I'm going living life. people still want play russian roulette Covid despite highly effective vaccine, dont know fuck tell people?    fair, fall would waaaaay worse hadn‚Äôt mass vaccinations. least don‚Äôt worry healthy vaccinated friends family dying. least, chance extremely small compared would otherwise. Moderna completed submission today. one learned last year. Kids can't get vaccinated yet.

The entire country virtual learning second straight year. Well let's forget kids dealing long-covid. increased occurrence myocarditis, blood-clot biomarkers, reduction grey matter. things found regardless severity. Nurse wrong. 28 days 3rd dose immunosuppressed patients don‚Äôt mount strong enough response two doses. It‚Äôs 3rd dose primary series. That‚Äôs ‚Äúbooster‚Äù, given point waning immune response.

It's almost like vaccinated population masked schooling could work.   actually hugely important finding.

Yes, vaccination better route immunity far less dangerous.

But think Vaccine Passport point view. person vaccination recovered Covid, study said he's several times better off. Given that, person eligible Passport? Allowed airplane travel, night clubs, etc? say yes, need prove status. honor system here. Maybe two confirming tests different sites something. Hey know, many countries including Mexico using ivermectin. Personally got vaccine yeah, horse dewormer thing mostly meme Well apparently know pharmacist got going me. 

I‚Äôm least intermediate. lack leadership amount hubris fucking staggering. There‚Äôs good choices anymore ‚ÄúMedical professional get me, oils supplements folks wise protectors‚Äù hardcore ones field day everything.

People stop worrying antivaxxers say. stance change depending news; rather, reinterpret news way fits stance.

If JCVI made opposite decision, antivaxxers would field day too. people come around say wrong. say straight like that, get  sayings like; gotten sooner, gotten vaccinated, think would sick, etc. They'll express, regret, guess mix ""I wrong"".

Most people thankful care get (and usually happy/thankful tell finally going home). random ""pure"" conspirationnists stay denial 'till end (when go home, or....) are

When COVID wards (I work Canada),we see little family, guess loved one get severe COVID could (or should) eye opener. stable, usually ask talk experience friends/family try convince many people get vaccinated. Imagine crisis effecting gas prices damn researchers lies incredibly low outdoor read rest comment address that‚Ä¶

Regardless, something may fit particular fallacy doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs bad argument. Finding fallacy isn‚Äôt simply ‚ÄúI win‚Äù button.

There reason believe physicians reasonable. Given current scientific consensus ivermectin likely doesn‚Äôt contribute improved outcomes COVID, physicians prescribing necessarily either unreasonable geniuses.

I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre geniuses. Maybe they‚Äôre right drug work. so, I‚Äôll happily stand corrected. can‚Äôt spend 24/7 reading news articles Rona anymore.

Amateur. tried make appointment hospital work required doctor's order make third dose appointment.

So went CVS, asked booster shot, that. pharmacist ask (if any) conditions had, last vaccine was.

Might hurt I'm skinny guy shaved head. Lol knew? family would lobby idiots would admitted hospital first place. great. don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever get covid stuck home people know running food. less immunity response contagious viral load variant. Delta significantly contagious virulent variant there, including original Mu. mean Mu spread area already affected Delta, Mu outcompeted Delta stronger variant.

To use crude analogy Hungry, Hungry Hippos: Delta get marbles mouth bigger anything else cover table. 


Sorry I'm repeating that's garbage analogy. week. Hope makes sense. Deny unvaccinated medical treatment already! going force vaccinations people. Either really speed booster shots variants come way ones take vaccine far ahead curve point un-vax drop dead. I'm willing go booster every 3 4 months that's takes. might impact reducing covid deaths enough people first die overdosing ivermectin. Eventually, people refusing get vaccinated prolonging everyone else. Agreed. Hospitals need start turning away unvaccinated ivermectin poisoning favor people deserving. . course I'm convinced know many people prescribed Ivermectin doctor treatment covid. Probably better they're going go buy unsafe dose meant live stock get prescription anyway.

Sometimes wonder everyone help situation want see people punished disagreeing them. almost justifies teachers principals gun.  specifically said reasonable physician would so.

Well yeah that's True Scotsman goes, implication physicians so, must reasonable. think blood borne like that. would need survive mosquito... discussed recent twiv.

I‚Äôm pretty big supporter optional mask vaccinated folks, life can‚Äôt figure every elementary middle school aren‚Äôt mandating mask students. literally aren‚Äôt approved vaccine wtf. True. guess can't tent/tarp elements away completely.

It one size fit solution means. Like said, I'm kind spitballing huge mess problem. Dart guns. enema might get mouths faster well that's one way get rid guy  Plague dumb... used go bed high wired I'm uneducated matters, correct I'm wrong, thought worry mu really competing delta. particular immunity gained delta exposure confer immunity mu, would delta outcompete it?  it‚Äôs really good parasites ship DC spread word increase voting them.    3 Miami-Dade Educators Die COVID-19; District Doubles Mask mean 12 vaccinated?

Also article Karla Hernandez-Mats, president United Teacher Dade, said appears **the teachers got sick start school year** still waiting confirm that. people live places suitable humans, unfortunately. August, that's huge chunk Texas. Bats aside, know fact cross species spread happens. wonder say, mosquito, hung around infected deer, pestered human, could human potentially catch Covid? Nope, fallacy here. specifically said reasonable physician would so. Based content article, don‚Äôt see reason suspect reasonable. 

That said, truly good physicians this, guess you‚Äôre right. don‚Äôt think one case physician something necessarily disproves comment, I‚Äôm going argue it. I'm pretty sure CDC specialized variant testing representative subset tests. want hear ones feel like idiots scared. admit wrong? convince family members take seriously? way thankful you?

It's matter time, guys. Yes, I'm curious at. apparently submitted middle June, that's almost 3 months ago.

The data pretty lean (0 got shot, 4 placebo) maybe asked increased trial size time collect data, find zero evidence that. radio silence.

Pretty sure Pfizer one similar results though. never thought leopards would eat face‚Ä¶ LOL.

That said, I‚Äôm really hope isn‚Äôt case, click bait topic adults vaccinated, people decide wear masks, teachers recover easily, one else gets sick.

Well yeah obviously, I‚Äôve shopping years significantly they‚Äôve ever stock one time wouldn‚Äôt give kids vaccine protect adults getting Covid, demonstrate benefit kids getting it. 

I disagree, I'll add going important take account toll ongoing pandemic children beyond simply catching virus, fact children need healthy adults care them. Many children lost parents caregivers covid, mention order magnitude suffer long covid/ongoing post-viral chronic illness homes. Schools likely cannot return normal kids vaccinated. simple equation. sense authorities overly cautious vaccinating kids -- without reason -- risk/reward equation child vaccination clear ever since delta took off.

Also - it‚Äôs simple everyone immune delta variant vaccinated get infected Mu variant.

So far - doesn‚Äôt appear imminent red flags delta variant discovered apply variant time. Lol feel it. outdoors, SE Ohio area greatest biodiversity country.

Ah perro eres m√©dico que time fall winter! knowledge, Mu allegedly resistant vaccine testing needed confirm that. 

Source: best understand it, coexistance possible Mu variants however, Delta still worrisome one. someone vulnerable COVID Delta Mu, likely catch Delta given sheer density viral load. 

Now terms consecutive infections residual effects? clue. Someone closer field would need answer that. agree fair brush anti-vaxxers ""just stupid"". People dying lies they're fed people trust.  Abbot type governor would issue executive order shut refineries oxygen shortages. make sacrifices good economy bullshit like that. Oh sarcastic?

you still need multiply covid risk chance infection (which clearly less 100%)...

Also, approve vaccine children higher risk groups..

Both together make decision hard... that's Montgomery county love dense pine forests, hear banjo Deliverance way CA. like practically everywhere, Mu saying true It‚Äôs like two Americas I'd like thank people creating ad hoc FDA trial ... guess skipped Lambda since knew name Lambda 2 said schools states like begin closing schools?

You realize, example, masks required sports California? ages 12-17 lowest vaccination rate ages? 0 kids 12 vaccinated California around half 12-17 year olds. seem wise schools open especially Delta.

Oncologist said get week next round chemo.
But news today seems like  Isn‚Äôt dangerous kids, though? Quit what? Social media?  Hm! Yeah, tracks. US literally used pandemic handbook response team. thrown 2016.

The US went best prepared worst prepared short time pandemic. Whatever needs safety net whims whatever administration is. What's petty arm twisting pharmaceuticals maker get distribution rights country business in, offices restrictions drugs coming country operate from, direction authoritarian, militaristic bullying government smug pleasure people, think win something awful, manipulating presence world we're honest, reason we're dealing virus first place. though, half fun. I'm pretty sure anosmia one common symptoms. Anecdotally, every person know contracted virus lost sense taste smell while. concern variant afraid of. one get around vaccines. One study showed like 80% people feel bad.

If want switch Moderna, 'oops forgot vaccine card, give one booster I'll put one' worked me. Stick chain pharmacies, probably less likely dig records. last point, you‚Äôre correct. However, remember every mutation monitored. Many aren‚Äôt considered significant followed researchers. Can‚Äôt wait pi‚Ä¶ day. Goddamnit. Technically nothing stopping you. honor system. expiring vaccines going trash thousands sure worried ethics waiting. Unlikely happen awhile Delta absolutely displacing immune evading strains. (Beta may well extinct *the* immune evading strain). least seems like leveling infectivity better evolutionary fitness cost immune evasion. doesn‚Äôt mean statement always true, globally displacing strains always infectious (D614G AKA Italian strain, Alpha AKA Kent/UK strain, Delta AKA Indian strain v2). SARS-CoV-2‚Äôs still getting acquainted human immune system. Given propensity ignorance particular ideological party ...

you lost started using 3 syllable words.  Who‚Äôs ready elephant walk?! God impersonal dishes karma accordingly.  Weirdly, seems another news item. People used seeing headline like ironically become immune daily death numbers.

The national news coverage largely centered around Afghanistan, Hurricanes, Texas law etc people assuming yeah Delta still going back. I'm afraid ask. I'm guessing teach cursive writing either. needs write keyboards?  read somewhere sort make educated guess hope cover swath impactful likely changes. source, though, take grain salt.  pandemic over. odd timeline 9/11's death toll large numbers. Trillions spent result large number deaths. small percentage overall population, they're still dying someone else's stupidity. Oh, boy, November 2020 again.  Woops real question, blame American anti-vaxxers strain Colombia? That's immunity works. body go around creating exhaustive set antibodies every part virus. Further, outside RBD less conserved.

And there's still significant chance getting sick. CDC downplaying using studies use running window cumulative data. combine pre-delta, pre-6mo dropoff data get average. Looking July alone paints different picture we're heading.  that's good enough excuse. know someone hbp, diabetes issues.. bis booster 3rd dose now.. poll actual data. 

12-17 lowest vaccination rate age.
And race? See! That's discussion. Insentivise people priorities people. Let decision.

I've back forth people thread nobody appears getting downvoter hell clear grey area touches ethics quite people.  know getting downvoted exercising critical thinking article left important detail--the number teachers infected. need critical thinking angles. recognize news sources leaving things story sound sensational. lean extremely right left throw critical thinking window favor conspiracy theories. level direction. That's point. There's zero evidence reason believe offers better immunity, since original strain mRNA vaccines didn't.

That's ignoring risk. See people I've criticizing studies downplay effectiveness dropoff including data months Delta people hitting 6 months. get people thinking like guy potentially winding hospitalized. Yep, clear cover ass move based screw ups drugs since one higher profile, they'll go see, children. whole lot need replaced. **non**-introverts, causing serious harm. maths depends long vaccine lasts. lifetime chance getting endemic covid could 100% needed boost every 12 months correct scaling factor. compare chance getting covid per vaccination could low 10%. could paid many nurses.  Well went well. Yea suppose cant look past prep tole covid might take someone specific position. 

And yes, could ""staged"" hospital visit, suppose we'll never know. speculation really. could faking sick really video. COULD be.  I'm struggling mental health. Especially hearing Mu variant. fear matter measures taking, stupid virus always around slowly pick us one one. Downvote want, that's fear. :(  Worth pointing boat specifically looking benifit child vaccinated larger picture Actually no. I'm fully vaxxed gladly get booster needed, actual 2 week lockdown mandatory masks *5 meter distancing* (since airborne - 2m business decision) would literally eliminate virus. Polls *are* actual data.

Also, included non-poll data CDC KFF.

Also, that's one county, representative country whole.

Also, missing demographic data many vaccinations, like CDC KFF data, could biasing results.

Also, 12-17 Biden's ""base support"". can't even vote.  true, European employers better ""compasion"" employees. 

Too bad terible ""American corporate"" culture speak bring imported countries. 

There thousands jobs done home default position employer general mistrust employees want insist working home less productive people normally slack arround.

Its ridiculous inhumane abbusive. kid's school stayed open year. isolated cases, acquired outside school. Aw man, another initiation!? Unfortunately provincial governments sensible here, today instead vaccine passports Alberta government giving unvaccinated $100 get jab 

And Alberta worst Canada right daily cases, total cases, total vaccinated, awful rare ever gotten accident driving. happened 20 years licensed driver, drive almost everyday. probably need wear seatbelt, hey rare I'll involved wreck based past history calculated chance wreck future, I'd rather deal minor annoyance buckling up. Please feel free expound drunk driving laws legitimate way mitigating social harm, required vaccinations not. feel free respond observation drunk driving perfectly fine. Like said, I‚Äôve conversation people consider conservative before. cynical take. That's goal since mid late 1980s. work preschool. shut early covid, started there.

We're open every day now. staff required submit vaccine cards. wear masks inside lot staff keep masks outside kids. We're keeping littles (and other) safe, time giving quality education. several hundred people clapping screaming closed room north korean way fight covid? Hm, yeah really wonder masks became big corporations best friends?

‚ÄúSection 7 National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) prohibited employers limiting employees‚Äô activities related ‚Äúcollective bargaining mutual aid protection.‚Äù National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), body charged enforcing NLRA, interpreted Section 7 mean employees right discuss salary wages. *See*, NLRB v.

NLRA applies virtually private-sector employers, exempting federal, state, local governments, employers subject Railway Labor Act, employ agricultural workers.‚Äù

Basically, NLRA protects employees‚Äô right discuss salary. employers may enact restrictions talking work, employees discuss salary time.

I quit discussing explaining believe vaccination.

It's kind survival fittest moment now.

I almost felt triggered last year friends family would espouse views mask mandates infringement. later vaccines safe. 

Now I'll response.

A little surprised several went ahead got vaccinated spring.

I think bit surprised disinterest reasoning.

Just I'll me.  unvaccinated laughing as*es made-up propaganda. justified ancient  Eventually we‚Äôre gonna calling fraternities sororities. First shot six days feeling pretty bad-- splitting headache, tired, depressed. Second shot super easy. Mild headache one day it. 

I would say third shot intense symptoms (fever, intense chills, etc.) lasted short period time. felt like people described feel like shit sudden goes away. sure children statistics student know fact UK highest obesity rates Europe. America still higher rates, relatively. 

Good question though I'd also like know advocating it. Nah freedoms different freddams!!! went restaurant without masks yell Freddams Freddams! set dont funme page. Interesting. It‚Äôs really wild seeing difference here. Imagine worry hospitals overwhelmed. I‚Äôll refer back months ago CDC director said vaccinated people carry fully expect could see another face proclamation referenced above. seems hear kids dropping dead kids wear masks get vaccines... understand anymore. horse ain't going wheres, dead cause caint find worm paste nowheres wonder Ted Cruz fled Cancun yet.

It‚Äôll worth long run. Wave one get sense hit harder rest country. Mostly Long term care (Northwood).

Then last summer everyone la-la land bubble low cases minor Wave 2 hit December, relatively higher third wave spring. Still overwhelming numbers.

I'm concerned keep talking phase 5 September 15 would remove mask mandates. la-la land again. Cases low, restrictions relatively minor, say huge university population going show (though / universities implementing vaccine mandate). also going children &lt;12 heading person school vaccine.

I feel rude awakening within month, crappy healthcare system strained. need look provinces (BC, Alberta), US states ask, truly think invincible this?

I‚Äôm introvert it‚Äôs completely utterly fucked life. single massive imposition living life I‚Äôve ever dealt. ^ East Tennessee

Also East Tennessee seen anyone wear mask months.   really wish CDC would update definition close contact include masks district basically using loophole avoid putting kids quarantine. CVS, Walgreens, Walmart, literally anywhere  fighting mask ban Florida important keeping kids home would smarter choice.

Disagree. person learning (with masks) really, really important. Pediatricians medical orgs agree this.

Teachers required vaccinated‚Äîto protect kids cannot be. would also increase teacher shortage, still necessary.

We shouldn‚Äôt let children‚Äôs futures held hostage teachers refusing get shot. Same... Isnt crazy? Friends 17 years feels like stranger. didn‚Äôt read isn‚Äôt UK it? something % childhood obesity diabetes makes us kids vulnerable kids UK nothing that?

What truly fear delta variant evades vaccines better (because don‚Äôt forget, vaccines aren‚Äôt nearly efficient delta alpha). variant contagious aspect, fucked.  Right work laws state cannot made join union part hired. I'm sure it. Fitting Pok√©mon (Mewtwo) result mutation. mean, yes things could done make virtual work better, biggest hurdle community wasn‚Äôt infrastructure/technology issues. obstinance resistance community. Students couldn‚Äôt seem help cheating rampant. Parents called ‚Äúcrap‚Äù ‚Äúpointless‚Äù said ‚Äúmy child can‚Äôt learn way‚Äù. would tell kids wasn‚Äôt real school, don‚Äôt take seriously. Students would report tech issues didn‚Äôt feel like work parents happy cover them. Soooo much undone work. hurdles faced cultural, technical infrastructural (is word?).

Not mention different job teachers end. Everyone basically starting year one teacher. It‚Äôs job translates well person virtual. It‚Äôs completely different set skills experience needed. 

I‚Äôm sure could overcome. Especially vaccines masks easy. really didn‚Äôt much problem enforcing spread kept quite low community. Yep. It‚Äôs also interesting anecdotal events considered empirical facts. told nonsense grandmother apparently disproves whole thing. place zero natural disasters. least volcano gives warning, unlike tornado Midwest. one ever says shouldn‚Äôt live entire Midwest.

Can‚Äôt tell ‚Ä¶./s dunno, change way deaths, hospitalizations reported, doubts accuracy  I've heard recent cases spread within families quarantine. true, makes 20 number look even better really community spread contact tracing easily. correct, $295 equal average insurance premium Texas. However, average cost, literally lowest benefit required health care plans. Perhaps exaggerating saying ""atrocious"", hardly ""great health care"". lambda variant - it‚Äôs spreading widely South America months. appears evade current vaccines. Since mu also came South America really hoping it‚Äôs unholy combo lambda delta. Neat story!  T-virus gets Republicans ain't bright  CDC hopeless, way healthcare done US allow proper collation data. even tracking breakthrough infections unless lead hospitalisation. fair, pre-Delta statement.

You take away choice live made people ICUbeds filled novax car crash.
You take away people's freedom everybody forced lockdown.

You condemn immunocompromised thatcannot get vaccine due health conditions either die lock job home.
Your selfishness tolerated chose get vaccine help thousands peoplefor benefitof one, yourself. hometown's local sub, poster taken daily case hospitalization data normalized account proportion vaccinated really striking: many vaccinated here, raw case numbers vaxxed unvaxxed often pretty close, take account 75%+ people fully vaxxed, get figures. survived, virus keeps evolving probably die.  Nobody reads articles Reddit. jump fray giving opinions. designed always so? measures could taken prevent this. states actually mandate masks schools, like dozen. another 8 completely blocking mask mandates schools. 

The remaining 30 states decided let local districts decide.  wife believes south trying herd immunity kids. state passed law schools cannot enforce masking. they‚Äôre sitting kids pods facing other. plexiglass. There's old board game called ""The Omega Virus"" discontinued. Time comeback! Vaccines work safe.  Also children large number cases can‚Äôt get vaccine yet. laughed way hard  went local fair, hoping we‚Äôd able find areas distanced well masked. Needless say, stood far away ‚Äî masked ‚Äî waited son wife picked food. left. 

This exhausting still good thing, treatment protocols improved, many hospital beds staffed.   let it‚Äôs thing? tried winter too. Ain‚Äôt working well them. abouts that? 

Here UK case. technically always true  charges filed? insanity. Suddenly global influx epidemiologists, doctors, virologists, governors, hospital administrators leaders.

The spooky thing is, they're YouTube research certified benefits outweigjt risks


In pandemic can't perfect information may surprising medical boards US also comprised experts. does. even 2011, UK top spot Europe. Ireland consistently starters. Dumb use cases define ""worst wave yet"" population 70% vaccinated, much higher elderly. Well, leaders access vaccines instant treatment antibodies soon test positive. They're probably going feel brunt disease... unvaccinated base actually care about.  Vaccinations mandatory years here.

Kids must vaxed, access school lost, manage reach age.

School also mandatory 16yo...so cant opt that.

Yes right call...because there's freedom wear clothes public. would different masks vaccines? changes every year. studied nearly decade ago. one UN has, 29 times, passed resolution calling end. one devasting cruel economic impact. 

But no, right, embargo pertain medicine. like crippling one sector sort spill effect. course not. actually 100% clear would right place high enough vaccination rates. Why?

Because addition reducing number new infections (by ~70%), vaccine also reduces long infected vaccinated person contagious reduces contagious are. reduce transmission rate even further.

Unvaccinated people *still* driving spread. No.

It's JCVI basing individual benefit/risk rather societal one. initially vaccine available CEV people, next vulnerable on. became eligible vaccine 7 months rollout started. assuming states reporting accurately, people even testing counted (I know many Canada won‚Äôt test anymore various reasons unless forced reason, always hidden cases still spreading showing reported numbers). mean say America higher percentage population suffer obesity. UK smaller percentage America, largest Europe time study (2012-2015?) We‚Äôve whole year+ upgrade nation‚Äôs infrastructure provide smooth virtual learning year last year. Seems like one anticipated pandemic last long. Pandemics last many years. Total arrogance part. Lookin like tuna roll It‚Äôs major city, probably 2 elementary school teachers building. think people calling full-scale lockdowns (which may needed now, happen moot point) blaming vaccinated (many masked) people otherwise resuming normal life current wave. understand everyone okay staying home day.

Anyone wants remain cautious every right to. masks mandated grocery stores least. asshole Wakefield UK? somehow exported blatant ignorance friends across pond? hope not. Remember: We've left summer. plenty people vaxxed, yet still bad Delta spreads easier. Last year date look anywhere near bad year western countries.

But actually last weeks, US festivals (Bonnaroo, EDC) added vaccination requirements first advertising events.

Outside United States, Mexico instance, require There's lot evidence, understanding, SARS particularly infections surfaces. read somewhere (sorry, citation) surface really get airborne without basically blowing surface kick back up, touch surface, somehow get touch lungs somehow. It'd pretty specific chain events, compared normal airborne breathing thing.

I suspect vaccinated person might shed small amount virus, depending fast body reacts it, might enough infect close contact compared infected non-vaccinated inoculated individual. spread vaccinated people? Sure, anything's possible.

Anecdote: wedding summer, reception indoors lot open windows outside. High percentage vaccinated individuals 4 5 kids. Probably 100-150 people. Someone day wedding symptoms tested COVID positive despite J&amp;J vaccine spring. mild case apparently. Confirmed Delta variant. couple let everyone came wedding know, specifically told people knew close contact person get tested.

We told get vaccinated. record numbers.
They told us 70%. it. said 75%. 80. tell us even 90% enough.

See comment *were  go  website got hit MU variant. slow load. mean many vaccines mandatory (especially young country like Italy many shots mandatory first years life) even think making even Covid vaccine mandatory seems like obvious moral solution. 

In Italy (thank god) costitution allow governament make mandatory sanitary procedure like vaccination population. I‚Äôm religious person all.

No school outbreaks, case counts pretty dang low. Hmmm wonder difference us Florida Texas entire districts shutting down. ""time buying"" nothing 

Again, ""nothing. Time buying got us vaccines, **the vaccines saved thousands thousands lives**, important thing. still contagious infectious mucus membrane/throat/nasal cavity vaccinated (which am, im arguing vaccines)

This different point, also much oversimplified. First, vaccines still stop ~70% infections. Second, someone gets infected, contagious less time. Third, even Ct value, vaccinated people less culturable virus unvaccinated people. is, less contagious. means vaccinated people contribute much less spread unvaccinated people.

I would happy provide citations one points dispute. almost feels like allocate certain hospitals clinics Covid only, protect rest population.I'm sure that's workable though. keep hospitals oveflowing kids 12 get vax. giant monsters? variant apparently getting around mechanism higher rate others. potentially mutations away back square 1....  taking virus seriously need entail catastrophizing things warrant yet?

People tired. tired everything related pandemic. summer numbers low much delta people basically got back life normal. numbers high, delta everywhere, people sick tired all. 

But everyone still wearing masks not. 

It used conversation neighbors various aspects pandemic. find one wants talk (including me)... i'd say we're weird state ""cautious apathy"" hehe. It‚Äôll stop day now‚Ä¶ happened Lambda?

I sincerely hope still unvaccinated, acquire COVID require hospital treatment... Someone sell popcorn next school board meeting. reason one getting much attention seems infecting vaccinated higher rate transmissible delta seems. least longer abortion six weeks. Priorities. /s  studies showing infection followed vaccination gives basically super immunity. vaccine provides antibodies based 1 proteins virus, important spike protein. natural immunity also gives protection 27 proteins make virus. 

Having re-infected indeed act like booster itself. continues debate whether boosters needed since breakthrough infections effect. Since children much, much easier route super immunity (vaccine followed natural infection) well protected now.  live similar area, think kids die, may choice. It‚Äôs outside worry about, though, events. It‚Äôs indoor spaces don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre there, like poorly ventilated bathrooms lines men, out, pee trough super close quarters.

The greater benefit vaccine you, quicker get it. That's individualistic approach. free jab many possible quickly, regardless individual need, societal approach. You‚Äôve got something better that. Come on, try something clever. fact ""the data keeps changing"" literally science action. That's whole point.

That's science works. can't quote textbook 1980s call science, understanding constantly evolving learn more. Consider teaching salaries. might average another professional, teachers make nearly much. hurts more. **This comment makes sense.**

The point lockdowns buy us time. used time.

We figured masks work.

We developed distributed several widely-available vaccines.

At point, dying covid dying *they chose* use tools.

*The rest us lockdown protect them.*

(I think need double vaccines and, temporarily, masks reduce risk kids--who can't vaccinated).  True, restrictions - good luck proving it. votes ? test lab must approved fda diagnostic test. tests separate strains likely approved clinical diagnosis useful researchers. Recall start COVID states one lab approved testing. Universities could test provide result diagnostic purposes. Oregon university started testing samples show wide spread COVID became.. I'd say state reporting higher 5% positivity rate expect/assume case numbers actually higher. 

Florida's latest report shows 17% positivity rate. likely folks going go get tested counted, isolating. health care overwhelmed, [Florida closing 27 state-supported COVID-19 testing relying locally-led efforts Florida Department Health, county health departments, primary care providers local governments, people can't get appointment. 

If someone takes at-home test waiting apt comes back positive, likely lot folks going get tested counted totals, isolating instead. 

It's possible see decline 5% population reported infection latest surge (so likely infected), even 10% infected 60% vaccinated... weeks months maybe they'll see spread less likely occur community spread... 

Idk hard look case numbers source truth positivity rate indicates entirely accurate, high positivity rate indicates enough testing done track record actual cases. dad sent link Google Scholar they‚Äôre ‚Äúlooking into‚Äù ivermectin. Couldn‚Äôt quite tell well done (not micro/chem major) told I‚Äôd rather wait meta-study addressed research methods.

He said ‚Äúbut works try it?‚Äù

Because also know fire would probably kill Covid pretty damn well suggest self-immolation course action. coworkers minor symptoms tested negative serial testing.

Fauxvid (as call it) going around also. I'd sworn wife got covid second time tested negative. also vaccinated lost sense smell taste again. definitely sick covid. mom similar issues also negative pcr. know rsv something going around. Shocker!! Well, people staying way college football games, doubt unvaccinated staying home Labor Day.

Every game watched sold many people wearing masks.  ""Only Czech Republic, Hungary, Belgium, Bulgaria, United Kingdom, Slovakia Italy ‚Äî along handful tiny countries ‚Äî higher death rates.

Everyone levels risk willing take, feel that‚Äôs at. walked around Cabella‚Äôs night, I‚Äôd say maybe 25% people mask on, noticed really didn‚Äôt think much it.

I guess point point start turning corner, slowly things get back normal. people without masks may may vaccinated, either way leading way prove it‚Äôs safe others strange twisted way.

I‚Äôm sure makes sense, I‚Äôm honestly trying justify head things aren‚Äôt bad, making progress ways. promoting them, mealy mouthed transparent it. watch trolling anymore. bad day. keep saying - ERs need bouncers. since it‚Äôs smith county, sure austin politician could you. looks like jail Tyler, live also could try reaching city council, may able help point right direction. might also local advocacy groups could try searching for. think may able file report DoJ probably gets filed away somewhere won‚Äôt looked years.

look comments thread, large people country don‚Äôt give shit state jails &amp; prisons. numerous reports abysmal quality county jails country repeated prisoner protests/riots conditions they‚Äôre forced endure, never stays news day.

until end private contracts jails/prisons take away profit imprisoning people try shift carceral system actually rehabilitative punitive, issues never go away. Angry upvote. loved show  let people go anything deem reasonable

Except basis race, national origin, color, sex (including sexual orientation), religion, disability, age, genetics, course. I‚Äôve stopped worrying new variants, honestly. know they‚Äôre serious contagious, I‚Äôm already basically stop Delta variant, can‚Äôt imagine Mu would different defend real, practical sense. It‚Äôs self-isolation, hand washing, touching face, forth. 

You‚Äôve got this; us take seriously do. Dig deep wait out. don‚Äôt kill Phil (even you‚Äôre sorry). That‚Äôs reason become anti-vaxxer though. get us exactly nowhere. Profits drive American politics policies since well, America.

Is wrong people didn‚Äôt encourage vaccination day 1? Yes. wrong become anti-vac that? Also yes. Dead on. Gonna use one.  What's prevailing wisdom right transmission COVID takeout food? (i.e. via infected food prep workers)

Smh. thought done greek life college.  Likely showing positive test yet point, rather issue test itself. Good luck finding them. amount cover 123 nurses 100k each. far seems risk delaying second jab increased risk catching COVID inbetween two. it‚Äôs never going end know someone‚Äôs gonna claim it. totally fine. Mu point. Shameful. less.  countries testing far higher percentage positive test samples determine strains involved.  I'm super disappointed City LA putting implementing mandate vaccines.

Dodger Stadium zero requirements. ""please mask up"" rule one enforces.

I'm really bummed missed Hella Mega Tour show yesterday. I'd waiting nearly two years feel safe going, despite vaccinated. scarily reminds World War Z creating ""Phalanx"" drug zombies. completely useless drug (in context) toted cure, simply placebo.

Mmmmmmn...doorknobs. randomized trial quantifies effectiveness masks. beyond ‚Äúthey reduce spread,‚Äù helps us understand much reduce it.  would definitely refuse again.

Last year in-school transmission cases. cities pretty good pull average up. rural places still 30's even lower. district basically using loophole avoid putting kids quarantine.

SAVANNAH, Ga. -- Martin Trina Daniel, married 20 years, died COVID-19 within hours other, leaving behind two teenage children facing unimaginable loss.

The Daniels met Savannah State University 1990s Martin Daniel headed Tuskegee University Alabama graduate school, nephew, Cornelius Daniel, told ABC News.

The couple settled Savannah, Georgia, raised two children: Miles, 18, Marina, 15.

Trina stay-at-home mom loved supporting immediate extended family Martin worked chemist, Cornelius Daniel said.

""He loved chemist,"" said. ""One reasons went Tuskegee went there.""

The Daniels' niece, Quintella Daniel, added went Savannah State uncle.

""He motivational person,"" said.




When COVID-19 pandemic erupted, Quintella, nurse, headed New York City, first U.S. epicenter, calling ""a life-changing experience.""

""You may lot people, 10 20 people, waiting one die get ventilator,"" said. ""I thank God every day 35 tests took ... never COVID.""

Martin, 53, Trina, 49, teenagers -- unvaccinated -- contracted COVID-19 June, family said.

Cornelius Daniel said aunt uncle hesitant get vaccinated part due legacy Tuskegee Syphilis Study, charted syphilis progression unknowing Black men 1930s 1970s.

Martin Daniel ""a stubborn attitude toward vaccines general,"" Cornelius said.

""He trusted vaccines around awhile,"" like polio, felt COVID-19 vaccines developed quickly, Cornelius said. (The quick COVID-19 vaccine development possible decades prior scientific studies demonstrating safety, well unprecedented multibillion-dollar commitment federal government accelerate research.)




The Daniels eventually came around idea scheduled get vaccine mid-July -- week died, nephew said. Daniels' symptoms hit end June quickly ""spiraled control"" around July 4.

Martin Daniel died home July 6. Trina hospitalized died night, family said.

""We already taken aback passing, endure passing ... traumatizing,"" Cornelius said.

Miles Marina, battling COVID-19 parents died, went hospital July 7 treatment. released hours later, Cornelius said, quarantine two weeks dealing loss parents.

After painful month, teens ""doing well"" ""adjusting new normal,"" Cornelius said.

The family dropped Miles college weekend Marina beginning sophomore year high school.

Miles Marina plan get vaccinated, Cornelius said, adding hopes others yet gotten shot follow teens' lead.

""The bullets right gun vaccines,"" Cornelius said. ""So would prefer vaccine ventilator every day. many families already experienced pain we're feeling.""  Depends look understand allow it. parents uneasy ""experimental vaccine"" use it, would available huge masses parents understand risks believe risks vaccine outweigh risks covid get kids. Everyone else could wait full FDA approval.

It speaks volumes turn away whole bunch families opted trial.

I'm surprised gotten downvotes, someone similar situation, I'm sending (presumably) long-distance high-five. Neil Young correct privileged position able say that. He's made millions rely concerts/merch sales order make ends. really. kidneys pretty fragile perfusion/oxygenation injuries concerned. COVID shown cause hypoxia little symptoms. walking around wearing pulse oximeter could low blood oxygen levels even realize it. Prolonged untreated low blood oxygen levels could absolutely cause kidney damage.  vaccinated person's fault stay locked 2 years unvaccinated person hospitalized catching covid relatively unlikely, brief window vaccinated person significantly contagious?

I say fault vaccinated person. say conclusion say hospitalized long-term damage....I going single quote provided said followed hospitalized. resistant vaccine spread people Delta trouble spreading in.  You‚Äôll likely fine, it‚Äôs outdoors, immunity prior infection + 1 dose likely give better protection people. There‚Äôs always small chance reinfection, you‚Äôve recently got vaccinated, antibodies likely high. similar Texas? think people assume Japan would lot forward thinking issue. Superb! Keep working hard maybe one day actually see happen yourself. meme üëè review hope FDA CDC pushback boosters‚Äî now‚Äî finally enlightens people messy public health messaging Biden‚Äôs White House. improvement former president, wouldn‚Äôt call dramatic one.

The poor mask guidance, misrepresented Massachusetts study, overemphasis breakthrough infections, flip-flopping, finally massive miss re: boosters. 

It really incredible WH literally put arbitrary date masses (September 20th) without full support CDC FDA. can‚Äôt wrap mind around it‚Äî encourage hypochondriacs around us get 3rd shot sans bring immunocompromised (lying healthcare workers themselves), certainly eroded trust even further. fucking mess. Yeah mean official gov stats put way. Yeah what's another 6 months? 
Then require 90+% population get booster. Another 3 months.
And doubt variant evades vaccine efficacy another booster.
There end game this. life now. HAHAHA RIGHT?!?

Sure risk low, maybe lower getting car dying car crash. still simple things reduce likelihood further, as: wearing seatbelt, paying attention, driving speed limit. Conversely, wearing good quality, well fitting mask seals, social distancing, getting vaccinated possible. amazing everything say dumber last thing said. Let‚Äôs see far floor thing. 

Please.

When models overpredict happens everybody congratulate claim right. models underpredict next surge, blame placed elsewhere.

Huh? really nothing besides vaccinated want SERIOUS lock home isolation variants covid. 

Because even vaccine 40% protected significant ability spread virus. 

What % serious you?

50% serious = getting vaccine still going out

100% serious = getting vaccine staying home yourself

The vaccine 39% effective Delta according Israel.

People dying shot, know long term effects, know long antibodies last, something like 12 weeks drops off. 

How many boosters need?

I many vaccines work excellently, seem one them. 

I wear masks go out, work home see many people. 

I'm certain already covid Feb 2020, get bad case I'll get stem cell treatment call day. God created virus obviously wants catch test faith /s Delta around India way people getting vaccinated saying really make sense. Yeah we're getting completely different messages here. one hand, enough risk expedite vaccine review. hand, risk continue quarantining healthy kids. we're stuck worst option, vaccine completely disrupting education. Wow. jail practically refusing book people. led interesting cases someone gets put jail released day back caught things taken jail released happening every week. I'm sorry go through. That's wrong many levels. Well that's mRNA (which mostly USA got, that's 50% reddit userbase)

For inactivated vaccines (sinopharm, Sinovac), full? viruses (though dead)

Wonder seem perform well, given proteins  End game endgame measles. ""...but dreams, siree"" easy see idiots selfish people! kinds! COVID get vaxxed. healthy weight. things (driving sober, watching 24 hour news cycle, etc). Bad bot. Yeah, complains.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* one make covid-19 vaccines completely pointless, would variant covid-19 new disease? both? Although likely, facts item? another item assumed true without facts back up? again, opinion - retract statement. good! :D  Precisely guess following science using common sense measures tribal fun team better team. Education kind important, agree one. Kids can't sit room 2-4 years. suck arts put hold long. Many small artists probably quit time focus things. whatever reason, double masking inauguration Fauci others‚Äî preceding major announcement changed guidelines‚Äî really rubbed wrong way bizarre way introduce country concept (that never really picked anyway). Even now, CDC suggests wearing double mask people beards STILL argues people wearing N95s. 

Was research behind it? seem logical moment (one better two)? kind moves seem small insignificant reality, destroy semblance trust government people. delta wave US subsiding whole yes. worry, replace forced births

/s much unfortunately Yes, better. They're respirators, all. forbidden. accepted management workers. Exactly. remember last winter media talked expected Beta (""South African"") Gamma (""Brazilian"") variants wreak havoc. Media practically salivated thought variants would spread wildly kill left right. didn't. Instead, Alpha outcompeted caused spring surge. Delta outcompeted Alpha caused summer surge. way know Mu do... sue honestly Though comedian, George Carlin brilliant man philosopher. Sure people welcome stay unvaccinated never leave homes. 

Sorry literally medical technology time every major religions creation. There's nothing religion actually mandates vaccination medical intervention. literally every religion existed hundreds years vaccines,so there's physical way says anything medical care. like saying Bible bans vaping therefore smoke pure tobacco natural way. possible. However extremists believe way interpret flavor religions sacred texts mean such. 

Every major religion world able seek medical treatment except extremists religions. religious exemption thing, ridiculous. Even Islamic Jewish people taken accepting vaccines made animal products accept it. fact many religions come forward stating vaccination absolutely something do.  Good stuff pull top screen see notification center - still there. Zinc Vitamin anosomnia. case COVID-related. Consult physician recommended dosages. know lot different therapies right loss teste/smell related COVID. Asshole continues asshole, 11.

a cnn article hour ago saying opposite almost I'm sure understand.

People get free vaccine insurance companies want save money?

Is point? can't be. Please clarify. What's goal vaccine? stated goal (CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky) others prevent serious infection...

Happy start listening experts acknowledge debilitating long covid also *serious infection*, death, hospitalization, severe illness. individual health risk, well economic burden society. call 50% efficacy long covid ""protection."" meantime, boosters is...  ventilation one passed bond 2019 upgrade middle school add pre-k elementary schools. used money HVAC. people taking precautions listening reports deciding stay home socially distanced family events outdoors vaccinated. Unvaccinated people lick everything sight, talk close one another 500 plus indoor parties. 

You're never going convince unvaccinated person anything. lot messaging needs stick carrot vaccinated following rules, sometimes double triple so. I've heard makes face tired. along handful tiny countries

Peru, Brazil, Argentina Colombia, Croatia, Paraguay Mexico tiny countries? higher death count per 100k US. without taking account dozens countries heavily underreporting deaths. point vaccine die get seriously ill get it. But, immunocompromised last thing want long-haul Covid. also don‚Äôt want kids long-haul Covid. forget already Delta variant, vaccine also reduced chances spreading it. alone huge. Delta changed equation though, even vaccine. It‚Äôs contagigious smallpox. It‚Äôs chickenpox. current vaccines deal strain? I‚Äôd say unlikely, especially restaurant they‚Äôre supposed holding food hot‚Ä¶ Covid dies higher temperatures Mississippi ""brain drain"" educated people move quickly, believe shortly starting become housing shortage. Lots investors/flippers bought single family homes, much development. 

My Jackson MS 2 bedroom apartment expensive Chicago 2 bedroom apartment one trendiest neighborhoods Chicago. Chicago apartment within 200 feet 9 restaurants, 2 grocery stores, 6 bars. Jackson MS would walk half mile get nearest bar.

DidnI mention pay sucks here? cheaper stay employed Illinois (flexible work remotelyhalf time), get roommate, drive back fourth take pay cut find similar job Jackson MS. literally sell items bulk business model get sick pass virus others vaccinated unvaccinated. sure idea came ""neighborly"" get vaccinated. talking point China, no?

Aren't placing blame frozen foods Vietnam? Thailand? Something like that. Pokemon joke. Initially, expected like virus scares, initial reports dire, virus would turn far less dangerous became known it. Except one wasn‚Äôt like others; learned, worse got. I'd say 1000%. At-home test results reported test positive doctor likely advise extremely rare test false positive (but false negatives sure common). 

So test positive home, going get tested change anything you, counted. 

But since even tested testing positive frequently, probably want use resources capturing cases unknown testing reporting. 

Considering fact [Florida closed 27 state-supported COVID-19 testing Jesus, come cruel people comments. Ask people keep arguing studies like this. know post title could better. coffee yet read post, sorry grumpiness car wrecks result fatality. mean safe. UK, 2nd shots 12 weeks everyone. weeks seems like problem. required vaccination proof Covid test, that's reason wasn't.  festivals that. really ought go full measure. they‚Äôre safety protocols, don‚Äôt go doctor get Covid (like antivaxxer neighbors), especially you‚Äôre going say you‚Äôre ‚Äústronger‚Äù people died. 

Stay home commit; live live, die die. taking seriously, getting incubated ER guy heart attack dies lack resources treat isn‚Äôt ‚Äúpaying price‚Äù like keep told people didn‚Äôt take seriously lived. agree there. true. You‚Äôre going get Covid takeout. C‚Äômon now, know this. Oh ya I‚Äôm saying don‚Äôt get vaccine. saying don‚Äôt it, infected, you‚Äôre completely defenseless. Mu Nah, seem like *really* help any. I've read ton articles say do, can't trust everything read online.

/s parent, totally get it. please, please take headlines grain salt, speak pediatrician risks child area. Children risk many, many things. AAP says child 6 ever go trampoline, instance, injury risk great. would bet parents shrug shoulders hope best hear that. I‚Äôm saying encourage child go McDonalds ball pit lick everything means! actually look positive news- risk kids infinitesimally small minds. That‚Äôs great thing!! PCR test rapid test? False negatives much common rapid tests. Maybe you. people they're distraction bullshit  report back variant find out?   There's evidence delaying second shot may make even effective, tell go get jabbed. Grammar pendants worst kind tons candy, (has) sugar coffee

I‚Äôm sure could figured tried, faith you. 

And prescription toothpaste much higher fluoride concentration, people problems soft enamel even wholesome think. two sons cerebral palsy. train sets specialized controls allow sons operate trains. got trains way interact sons.  Leader's, lol religions don‚Äôt allow vaccines don‚Äôt allow someone gets sick seek medical intervention. get sick cancer can‚Äôt get help believe pray enough god deems righteous person god heal you. pray sickness away. teacher responsible disclose illness covid. Sports aren‚Äôt fun. mean? part done every single test? goal, however, get Covid kids get Covid, even though vaccinated. 

This seems impossible, what's point vaccine?  G  Vaccinated people still careful. freedom fighting rebels take reason go spread even plans begin with. order keep family safe. right thinking people feeling like okay risk exposure.

Like you, we're vaccinated still staying much possible exception work grocery shopping. wear masks even though majority people around us don't.

I'd rather take risk. Plus, one knows longterm effects I'm never find future. Last literacy rate/ education usually 2nd poverty rate. 

What NPR , FOX News, CNN, etc tell many anti vaxxers white rural top voters. fiance doctor major hospital, patients covid, get vaccine primarily low income, poor lower educated African Americans ages 30 up. 

It's hard explain almost systematic make African Americans 2nd class citizens, local pastors, churches, radio hosts etc purposely spread misinformation communities. 

When began opening ass vaccination sites predominantly white rural areas. car make there. would 3 hr walk. Uber exists offering free rides well promoted.

The forms sign online, mobile friendly websites, desktop computer, computer illiterate cable internet, able sign easily vaccines. 

The walgreens/ CVS covid tests available always covid tests. whole thing shit show, one takes responsibility. Care share supplements? I've got mine back 70%. long mild symptoms last? teach get allergies. questioned may caught mostly unmasked students faculty. clinic said needed symptoms 3 days would test me.

My district also says vaccinated people quarantine...  "
