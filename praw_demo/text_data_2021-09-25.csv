Ended getting breakthrough case covid continuing take precautions. Luckily mild, would rather booster, matter side effects. 

Now I‚Äôm going lie get booster two months so. NZ doesn‚Äôt enemies, explain recent Christchurch massacre People reasons wanting take relatively new vaccines

Those reason consistently stupid wrong ones likely require boosters future

Vaccines require multiple doses/boosters time. like holdouts preventing others vaccinated.

They still spread disease, create new mutations, flood hospitals stopping responsible people getting treated. Cheers ;) Nah, restrictions vaccine anyone, except age used tests, course. demographic people got vaccine mostly due received vaccines.

It went like this:

- january march mostly Sinovac, elderly health professional got that. 
- April May, Sinovac slowed got lot Astrazeneca.
- Beggining June shipments Pfizer started getting big.

So older are, likely got either Sinovac AstraZeneca. younger are, likely got Pfizer. Nowadays getting Sinovac shipments afaik, AstraZeneca Pfizer out. Lack education doesn‚Äôt make stupid, education doesn‚Äôt make smart. ‚ÄúEducated‚Äù antivaxxer, although likely minority, proving point. Cheers then!  proof data

Not none. less. 
Thinking it, really new idea. already got things like ""emergency use authorization"". Maybe rifined. reduce incidence severe cases, percentages much higher that, helped lot since beginning vaccination, already drastically reducing death elderly people. seems concern vaccine length time effectiveness begins decline (this aspect still evaluated vaccines). indications effectiveness drops months, application third dose health professionals elderly people took vaccine 6 months (this time preferably another vaccine) started.

Every vaccine use Brazil offered adult 18+: Janssen, AZ, Sinovac Pfizer. exception pregnant women receiving AZ, know changed.

Only Pfizer allowed 12-17 years old.

Amazonas doing? know got hit hard early friends would like go back visit I'm concerned situation now. Yeah, literally everyone gets it. they're egregiously expensive.

This matter ~2 months, worldwide demand stabilizes, meantime 100 million first/second doses lot good 100 million third doses. logic follow ‚Ä¶ horse dewormer much. üòÇ covid picture. double lung transplant age person. Well again, gives expectation, doesn‚Äôt provide real reason it‚Äôs gonna happen. It‚Äôs like Delta isn‚Äôt already New Jersey. fact article states Delta accounts 99% new cases state already.

I‚Äôve New Jersey family there. Beaches really busy summer, restaurants packed, school session weeks now, sports happening, concerts etc. things brought Delta state gave New Jersey Delta wave, already signs subsiding. mention vaccines. fail see winter would worse things already promote spread happening months Delta state months now. start refilling early well? Kinda depends insurance. meds I‚Äôm always freaked I‚Äôll run out. while, feel much better going vacations stuff. There's pandemic. hits old hard, last long. hits young, grind live, permanent life long complications. protesting alone time need mask? WTAF? said wanted know. tested negative, 3 people tested positive second test. I've told assume it. I'm asymptomatic right now, mild cough highly productive (lots snot coming up, almost like week quit smoking). 

I'm worried myself. NP clinic said either super mild covid infection, vaccine job, seasonal ""crud"". wife negative symptoms. I've told return office work one week. 86 per cent eligible people received least one dose.

Vaccination plus covid protocols continues provide path success. fastest path back normalcy. recently read public shaming failing Japan. big, anonymous days. (They publish names wrong doers) Nothing mandatory, fuck mandatory don‚Äôt link data right now, I‚Äôm mistaken Astrazeneca seems administrated, 45%. Pfizer Sinovac around 20% (?), idea abt Janssen. Dang. Find new doctor! embrace it. let simple minds signal themselves. Well unvaxxed residents outdoor boroughs tourists also come Manhattan Brooklyn.   kinds Ohio State Highway Patrol said troopers aware possible disruption Monday morning commute various social media posts truckers threatened protest road.  viral posts social media suggested truckers could cause big issues roads Monday beginning 7 a.m. posts call ‚Äúslow rolls‚Äù complete blockage mask vaccine mandates.

Just clear considered peaceful protesting.  Aside criminal liability, truckers participate better good retirement plans could also face revocation commercial drivers license. mean comparing country US Covid isnt really great comparison lol. I'm curious, genuinely feel safe tho? France ranks #14th active cases 154,811 around 4700 new cases daily, like cases even vax passport 83%? Fully vaxed. Well New Zealand messed vaccines badly. That's good question. know data confirm stated factual seem way, could also news outlets give American cases coverage countries appear way. 

I caught COVID around March/April got *very* sick 2 weeks. I'm average weight American male mid 30s preexisting major health conditions largely cautious eventually contracting it. get hospitalized worried questioned going one point breathing got little restricted. wondering level exposure virus strength one's immune system contributing factors determine sick someone actually gets. surface, that's appealing thought... maybe sci-fi novel, far-flung planet. Resolutely untrue, though. country multicultural that, influences come far wide make modern Australia.

And crimes committed politicians white-collar over. follow numbers daily. vaccination rate support people quitting jobs lieu getting vaccinated. believe reports say many people getting vaxxed secret. Americans shape thought funny, Miami places requiring masks, things already feel pretty normal. ""normal life returning"" would last (private business, public transit) mask mandates going away.

Be specific, remember exclude anything obviously social stigma social pressure.

Maybe area nurses suck ones ever able inject ones took time calm give multiple tries. 

Still get shots people can't. news want hear!!!

Yep, latest variants much aggressive - resistant antibodies previous infections vaccine, cause severe illness, spread easily children. 

Vaccines still help slow spread provide protection, aren‚Äôt magic force field. honesty wish equivalent silver bullet, wanting getting, I'm grateful wonderful gifts science anyway. lot Black Latino people less confident trusting government tend vaccine hesitant. support masks, vaxxed, cannot handle COVidiots making go longer should.

Just like doing, wearing masks, avoiding close contact non-vaccinated people large group gatherings still important even vaccinated individuals. 

It stinks, it‚Äôs way ‚Äúvery safe‚Äù covid right now. ah gotcha, mean definitely keep mask going around 2 seconds picture think little crazy. people even wear going store, concerts, conventions etc. It‚Äôs Superhuman bias towards themselves.

I'm hard time finding it, remember seeing children 12 still lower hospitalization rate someone vaccinated 60. Yet vaccinated 60 year olds allowed go around without mask much US. wish could find google searching seems lead articles without numbers. I'll edit find could sworn reading study this. Maybe I'm wrong. increase class sizes due lack teachers, enough staff monitor mask compliance social distancing, covid cases going skyrocket. opportunity last year make masks part fashion many people ignored that. look really cool / beautiful cases people try, much would rather see peoples faces (especially lips talk) really option things bad, people made best it. 

celebs could made fashion statement, US last president could sold campaign items every day, could much better been. tell he's smiling twinkle eye, adorable! According CDC 183m people US fully vaccinated would mean death rate 12,000/183,000,000 = 0.00006%. That's even counting received one dose. odds better statistic anti-vaxxers give claim, ""I'm scared virus 0.02% death rate!""

Yeah, even 12k death figure true not, would also take odds rather getting COVID without immune protection. won‚Äôt ‚Äúcan‚Äôt believe wore that‚Äù really, that‚Äôs reserved bad trends lol. local father spoke school board meeting anti-mask child wanted wear masks make big deal around kid. advocating remove mandate. seemed like reasonable person meeting, scary. mostly speaking social phases life.

I'm dreading ~18 hours travel next year turns two come US months. Certainly heard parents kicked planes they're physically unable keep mask crying two year old meanwhile first class, adults lowering sip champagne. parent three year old, think could kept mask child hours end year ago?

An evidence based approach would look percentage community spread specific groups, European models based on. Perhaps infected, kids spread families that's concerning, rest world basically said science good enough mask toddlers. US country masks political one that's decided 2+. think think that's coincidence.

FWIW we're looking getting flight Cancun long haul. said COVID patients develop hypoxemia low oxygen content blood, little medical staffers do.  lungs longer get oxygen blood organs affected...

As someone know feels, fun, imagine running long marathon, respiration never goes back normal, keep breathing quickly time passes less able speak properly

It huge effort walk alone even say name emergency room, nurse checked vitals, take bed wheelchair, later ended intubated, thankfully fully recovered young time helped me. 


And yes, vaccines available.  really like Give mom awardüëëüèÜ 8yr old cousin could‚Äôve told us this. Come New York. venues vaccinated baby.

&amp;#x200B;

And yet many New Yorkers STILL refuse vaccine. work compnay litterally told employees saying get vaccinated, little work, any, get vaccinated. yet half refuse. get it. Healthy children limited risk, US require employers provide vacation/sick days parents often send children school sick, virus coming largest spike yet southern US, many people got sick i'm extremely difficult find in-person medical care even typical issues &amp; illnesses, populated areas extremely large, overcrowded schools there's ability social distance.

So, yeah, people choosing send kids school masks. Please get flu shot protect community!

But I‚Äôm convinced we‚Äôll bad flu season winter. two biggest flu transmission sites? Offices schools.

Well, white collar offices still either remote remote-optional. And, contrary popular belief, masks schools common. good enough backstop bad flu season.

Winter 20‚Äì21 horrifying Covid season flu season. I‚Äôd wager Winter 21‚Äì22 bad Covid season mild flu season. Winter 22‚Äì23 real ‚Äútwindemic‚Äù season, first many come.  tricky situation ol New Zealand used reference point text books years come, sign times Covid-19 developed natural immunity?  statement clearly shows immense challenge government communicating COVID vaccines. infer ""we can't fully anticipate long term problems"" COVID logic applies vaccines. experience, main objection vaccines college graduate (this century, post-internet) community. hate smile always - teeth showing teeth showing - I'm realizing perfect opportunity actually photo taken. Blocked Joseph Bianco, Trump-appointed judge.

Strap in, folks, sorts setbacks going keep happening decades come. Fucking american propaganda. Disgusting. mean... hate needles, really?

Scratch previous statement. Anything increase number vaccinated people good book. arguing definition confirmation bias, instead beliefs (and acting based them) without solid evidence part human nature, therefore crazy.

Are organized religion think less people faith? ask condescending tone writing. award ceremony still going. like Jerry Lewis telethon end. smart. Look, SII manufactured vaccines advance India use later. SII (India) donor recipient well.

In EU suffered tremendously due vaccine orders going USA UK. thought ball court, EU made stupid contracts too. meant tens billions dollars.

I confusion.

The problem insurance (or death) makes Healthcare basically free, like situation idea much ""free"" vaccine cost, aside 3-4 days sick month headaches.  patients need vaccinated, including regular boosters every three six months. hard find enough home health care workers normal year. pandemic makes staffing much worse. vulnerable people home anyway? 

The government mandate vaccines nursing home staff, also gives higher ratio patients Healthcare worker. government also mandate elderly receive care nursing home instead home. pulling medicare social security eligibility. 

I family receive home health care. They're vaccinated, way stop anti-vax adult children going visit them. would control safely nursing home. They're social security Medicare, obvious route government mandate behavior. idea we're point. people finished high school college using typewriters. None educated enough make decisions own.  50 years people still saying dont truly know side effects are.

Ho know this? every medication. won‚Äôt employee month last year wore mask picture, friend mine works honor Mom &amp; work school system. Mom works young special needs children. Despite BS anti-maskers, completely adapted masks. works high school. kids vaccinated &amp; better wearing masks adults. also overreact like adults reminded wear masks correctly. 

Sadly, adults working schools dependable &amp; like reminded masks work. Seriously. kids like, oh 15 month old baby might get horrible disease live rest life. Whatever, don‚Äôt look cool mask. wide leg acid wash cargo jeans. Dope. Thats big tent works. name power, end including lot people rather associated with.

Its result unholy marriage religion politics.  sad people glorifying photo something proud of, sobering reminder humanity going right now. able see interpret human facial expressions important part basic social interactions nonverbal communication. healthy deprived extended period time, especially children.

I think lot people made pandemic much part identity seeing stuff like serves sort validation we're going (""wallowing suffering""). However, something like celebrated, serve impetus us get pandemic return healthy human social behavior. Good kid! Mom! Malignant Trumpaholics try destroy family now... watch.  Okay actual freak going Singapore? 80% population vaccinated - almost much Denmark - yet hospitals strain caused case surge?  Ooh, Texas. hear making huge progress women's healthcare /s even news? pandemic. course going keep mask on. Remember grandpa took horse dewormer lady Facebook said cured covid? weirdo, funeral! added ‚Äúbut still stupid, saying disabled, really stupid.‚Äù There's balance this. Hospital workers see worst COVID worst vaccine side effects daily jobs. one anaphylactic reaction pharmacy half hour vaccinated. ER nurse would different perspective would exposed patients anaphylactic reactions multiple times since vaccinations started. 

Along lines, hospital workers infecting patients way nursing home workers did. difficult give rational reason need vaccinate caught COVID past 18 months, took care sickest COVID patients, saw patients extreme negative vaccine side effects, clearly infected patients. them, vaccine mandate admission hospital longer going implement precautions kept safe pandemic. 

The logical argument use group explain risks catching COVID outside hospital increased dramatically, point vaccine protect us overloading Healthcare system. likely seen hospital become overloaded. important focus reasoning, ""bUt PaTieNts Risk!!!"" point well known vaccinated people spread COVID, hospital workers frequently exposed strains break vaccine. They're trained logic, background knowledge experience COVID different ours. 

I'm still trying understand people want vaccine think COVID fake, conspiracy. thing seems change mind someone close dying COVID, even inconsistent. thought big republican guy. Surely anti vaxx right alley    Preprint articles require higher degree scrutiny rigor accurately evaluate many types articles. kind discussion would appropriate strictly scientific subreddit /r/COVID19.

The cultural norm / ease getting hold surgical masks made simple do.

There's lot ""western"" things look back bewilderment, US reaction COVID anti maskers / anti vaxxers... blew freaking mind.

My issue poster calling simple things work. processes reason vaccines rolled late summer last year even though initial phases trials showed really well. 

I got AZ Moderna 8 weeks later.  data AZ/Phizer dropped got mine still calculated risk, much lower risk getting second doses risk AZ.  Covid cases high patients sent province. 

I understand DRs front line workers J&amp;J shots getting Moderna/Phizer boosters. mean CDC/FDA information need recommend general population. flu never met grandfather.  remember thinking, ""how could anyone ever die flu?"" got age, practically willing heart keep beating. joking around. current rate would take 365 years.

Safe say roommate always takes mask class.

Funnily enough, stared someone math long enough put mask probably staring every opportunity since person nearby wearing mask That's absurd. Almost kids die covid. Exposing kid covid far likely kill kill kid, orders magnitude cases.

I mean, Garth Brooks refunded something like 350,000 tickets. (And tickets aren‚Äôt cheap, either.) can‚Äôt even *begin* estimate revenue ticket holders would generated venues communities. Hopefully larger venues straighten sh-t soon they‚Äôll hemorrhage failure. :( I'm completely honest, got COVID vaccine able many things love year, recognized vaccine would quickly become required lot activities enjoy.

We in-person ‚Äúcommencement‚Äù October make virtual commencement spring, personally I‚Äôm preparing cancelled ‚Äúdue Covid‚Äù, think everyone planning attending too. Especially given state pandemic rn.  longer recommended antiseptic? ^*There‚Äôs

You equivocated entire point. ..Where new, vaccine resistant strain born. spread last 20 months again.

This can't 'leave alone'. One wild game butcher China spawned worldwide pandemic. Next time it'll antivaxxer. cellular immunity involved. Also, evidence antibodies created equal look titers mRNA JNJ vaccines. geometric mean titer mRNA vaccinated person 250,000 range. GMT JNJ vaccinated person 350 range. Yet, protection conferred 1000x range. There‚Äôs obviously going neutralizing antibodies.

All sorts things going body undergoing antibody evolution lot work done germinal centers involved. it‚Äôs inhumane separate families state crisis parties vaccinated bureaucratic nonsense rules. quickly realistically think QLD reach 90% vaccination? many fully vaccinated people, followed rules part, subjected this? us taught go feel bad unfortunately. Hell even doctors look weird requesting test I'm young. something good comes covid I'm hoping culture change routine check ups  different day. anyone found research discussing long need exposed someone Delta variant order likely get infected? heard 15 minutes earlier pandemic. Since Delta twice contagious, sure means 7.5 minutes linear like that. 

I line store someone front coughing bit- masked double masked, place maybe 5-6 mins. Obviously might even COVID. curious. That's got taken toll liver kidneys. Even somehow pulls survives covid, battle life over. Friendly reminder direct death toll accurate barometer damage caused disease. still learning really means ‚Äúlong haul covid.‚Äù Get vaccinated mask up! True. I‚Äôd say certain behaviors certain group environments (and do) substantially increase transmission. 

The ‚Äúmitigation math‚Äù still applies everywhere, densely populated areas: group size, duration exposure, masking, ventilation, distancing, hygiene, vaccination rates, etc. 

Sometimes, even rural folks seem forget tend socialize like everyone else. I'm south San Francisco vaccination rate high. Transmission currently single digits. large, people wearing masks taking precautions. huge chunk population healthy begin with.

A lot antivaxxers make claims virus 1-2% mortality rate you‚Äôre certain age also don‚Äôt realize diabetes, smoker, fat, another underlying health condition, odds dying go 5%. think top range, numbers saying cna go high 9% chance death based health conditions alone. 189 pills week??? That's 27 pills every single day.


 got wisdom tooth removed taking 3 pills day I'm complaining.   disparity mostly media sensationalism, it‚Äôs also delta variant spread quickly among unvaccinated, tend younger.

The situation isn‚Äôt significantly worse countries, even doesn‚Äôt seem like reddit.  difference it‚Äôs part easing travel restrictions countries, it‚Äôs policy simply easing travel restriction way taper. Either way attack freedom movement becoming prevalent domestically internationally would retake? We're middle pandemic, responsible thing do. Kids give shit picture day lmao really parents Trucker here. Vaxxed masked interacting others. lot us best. some, like fields, willfully beligerent. Please disparage us stupidity minority. Vaccination important. Delta contagious everyone going get eventually. went Duke. supposed institute high academic standards. get athlete. damn.  Atomic oxygen caustic organic even get cells cell membranes compromised damage DNA.""

Just like vaccine supposed do. least make magnetic. Also doubt schools full compliance students properly wearing masks. Mine blame teachers ruining relationships difficult kids constantly fighting keep on. politized kids think theh going lose rural boy's club card comply proper mask wearing. able google Z√© Gotinha unable figure Drip Joe lol. I‚Äôve never experienced burning hydrogen peroxide. grew around lot hippies used brush teeth. Foamy, painful.  They're clearly dedicated obstinate childish, job cater them. wonder many truly believe doctors wholesale killing people people tricked going hospital care. numbers still inflated.   man extremely lucky receiving lung transplant due COVID unvaccinated. Many places transplants COVID patients. 

Very scary Delta variant ravaging younger people previous variants, though. Wild COVID really lot worse flu people whereas now, Delta equated severe flu case baseline worse you‚Äôre unvaccinated. 

I‚Äôm Canadian, several ICUs filled patients 30s 40s relatively healthy prior catching COVID whatever stupid reason another, chose get vaccinated. vaccines aren‚Äôt necessarily effective catching virus (although spread significantly slowed fully vaccinated population) extremely effective hospitalization death. People fully vaccinated still getting hospitalized dying COVID anyway would likely impossible time beating matter circumstances. least won‚Äôt clog ICU hold outs crazy stupid though, attitude harmful.

True, end hospital horse paste people. ‚Äúbe less threatening, as: ""If floss already, keep good work. flossing, might good time start."" ""Flossing: easy. give try?"" found participants' reactance significantly lower message acceptance higher.‚Äù

Honestly need treated like spoiled child avoid dying... that's lol.  cares? dumb CHOOSE getting really sick maybe dying, that's fault.

I understand self-flagellation among (authoritative) public health people, they've done good job.    lot half got Pfizer. can't find exact % Google completely useless now... picks thinks keywords search shows popular results general topics, instead trying find something best matching query like used to. anyway remember reading lot more. They're nebulizing hydrogen peroxide. mean, they're far off. Smart kid, least next gen bCks, made mess Yeah it‚Äôs tricky thing address. technically right, danger Covid wasn‚Äôt much average person ended hospitalized killed, contagious dangerous enough much raw people got infected time resulted high amount people going hospital dying once. yes, technically non risk group they‚Äôll probably fine, would tempt there‚Äôs perfectly good vaccine. Honestly, they‚Äôre going get vaccinated choice matter sort information give them. brainwashing thorough. *has* done force. I'd laugh one day one stupid ""cured"" actually worked. know infinite amount monkeys smashing keyboards comes perfect copy Hamlet...

""Guess cure covid actually pouring gasoline butthole all!""  many things remember. inject disinfectant. inhale hydrogen peroxide, take horse dewormer. Jeeze, like expect Einstein here. I‚Äôm wondering vaccine they‚Äôre using. vaccines 75% effective. absolutely people like after.

I merely pointed original statement factually false. know non-American lives factor decision all, since government assign value all. wondered.  Public shaming would kept idiot antivaxxers feeling confident enough share insane views friend first place. He's way out. pay attention him. So, effectively, population density important layman might think. TIL.

EDIT: spelling  would make sense, hasn‚Äôt made govt provide preventative/early care almost anything else people, despite costing more. shame keeping mouths shut though. take larger society settle small pockets backwaters like minded folks. great, can't wait every news story next two weeks people inhaling H2O2. stop. Phaaahaa! new thing now! Holy shit! loss words. Whatever do‚Ä¶dont get vaccine‚Ä¶.do number dumb shit‚Ä¶but dont vaccine. See there?‚Ä¶ shit weird. Unchewed bubblegum. Covid vaccine isn‚Äôt cure car accident. great hospitals slammed. Good, want lose Garth. man's national fucking treasure.  ignoring logistical issues. much let Americans suffer help rest world tiny bit quicker mandate, rather definitely let influence vote.

America rest world far, already sent 110m billion way. Honestly I'm sick hearing that's good enough unless also let Americans get sick want avoid to, best case scenario logistical issues exist, get 1/6th there's 2 month wait 1/6th.

He refuses get vaccinated he's young healthy (we're mid 30's recently quit smoking addicted like 10 years). anyone ever convinced someone get vaxx holding similar views? consider friendship lost cause? best get since covid around long enough us know.

Keep talking confidently hope one realize talking ass. feel like shit whatever reason hospital....why leave it? Question: evidence Covid vaccine could cause strong immune response common colds coronavirus strain?

I currently suffering effects mother colds - longer sore throat, sneezing coughing persistent mild fever week feel like would describe hangover reasonable drinking session. tested negative covid two lateral flow tests PCR test fairly confident it‚Äôs Covid-19.

Anecdotally seems alone also BBC article. Could course cold strain going around particularly nasty due cold long time natural immunity weaker? UK btw.  Severe illness spread rather evenly across age groups demographics. Death heavily weighted towards certain conditions old age. extreme example many young people chronic health problems shortened life due covid-19.  Mostly side effects could easily distinguished.  Hi, NBA us favor kicking players league. keeping around damage causing. copies Trump virtually everything, secret. Steve Bannon even worked campaign. need prepare drop economy people feel safe outside.  80's vaccinated 18 million kids polio single day IIRC.  ACIP decide vaccines insurance must cover 100% costs for? already updated recommendations boosters match FDA/CDC decisions, covid vaccines would covered insurance without new regulation needed ACIP anything, least insured (90% population). 30 million people would probably access via county clinics get all. r/nonewnormal  make sure keep way :)    honesty, despite French side every label signs, use French Canada almost exclusively province Quebec. 
I learned throughout school never used outside school hasn‚Äôt stuck me. people west east coast don‚Äôt even touch French. unfortunately it‚Äôs engrained might seem.

I think one big reason large number immigrants refugees coming Canada, places English dominant, necessary language. French seems always pushed wayside.

EDIT: Clarity hospital beads, funeral homes vacancies still people think wearing masks getting vaccine wrong. Except ""crimes"" involved hungry people stealing food items sell food. ""criminal class"" made majority transported convicts mostly poor people. wanting take **relatively** new vaccines

*creak groan shuffle shuffle*. hear moving goalposts. got booster Friday, exactly 7 months second shot. Got booster like 5:30, headache fell asleep around 9, basically incapacitated woke twenty minutes ago. Fever finally gone, soreness (other injection site) gone, appetite first time since getting shot. experience booster vs. second shot similar terms intensity shorter overall. second shot floored 48 hours. Seems like booster knocked 36.  analysis 520 U.S. counties, CDC found pediatric cases rose sharply places without school mask requirements. separate report looked Arizona‚Äôs two populous counties, agency found schools without mask requirements 3.5 times likely experience outbreak schools them.  polls show majority parents support mask requirements ‚Äî despite recommendations pediatricians CDC ‚Äî schools remain bitterly divided whether implement them. Opponents mask mandates say parents get decide whether children wear them.  pandemic already taken toll new school year. third report, CDC said 900,000 students 44 states affected closures Aug. 1 mid-September. Many schools contending challenges multiple fronts, including outbreaks force staff quarantine staff shortages make difficult find replacements.  CDC looked pediatric case data 17% U.S. counties found that, average, pediatric cases rose schools reopened. counties without mask requirements saw larger increases ‚Äî 18 cases per 100,000 ‚Äî them. Among counties CDC studied, majority ‚Äî 62% ‚Äî school mask mandates.

The fact parents think children wearing masks proof parents making decision kids. Mask requirements save lives. Vaccine mandates save lives. countries vast majority people vaccinated. corona virus rates even worse prevaccine times.

This objectively false. list vaccinated ""fully deaths last 10% total deaths last 5 chart speaks might exception **13** deaths per million entire pandemic. last four months equivalent *one day* trend clear. Countries actually *the vast majority* vaccinated great.

You might thinking Israel, everyone's favorite anti-vax propaganda days. 62% nearly enough herd immunity vs Delta, herd immunity threshold 85% so. Even so, *vast majority* deaths among unvaxxed.

Waning immunity red herring - vax still stops almost deaths several months, many vaccine protocols end 2 shots. Polio takes 4, example. governor Trump-ette diagnosed OCD. One medications take studied treatment COVID. terrified potential shortage. three days without medication, start getting terrible withdrawal symptoms. Then, five, intrusive thoughts come back. medication gives kidney stones. 

Experts saying there's almost chance supply shortage. That's reassuring believe people accounted stupidity.  lower vaccinated states taking turn spiking.

As soon got hands enough vaccines vaccinating almost 2 million people per day Dude, you‚Äôre taking photos ID purposes, capturing magical memories. kid doesn‚Äôt want mask indoors, walk outside snap photo phone give school. doesn‚Äôt need harder photos don‚Äôt need perfect standard background - safety way important. nice run -18 months feeling healthy. We've taken nasty cold daughter back school. Thankfully PCR tested negative forgot awful sick. I'm pro mask cold flu season travel sure. young people get? Curious since rare bloodclots know quite countries offered AZ older people like France 55+ Uk 40+. Brazil decide offer adults instead? Alabama would [reason make ‚Äúbecause cases now‚Äù.

Despite district Alabama it‚Äôs actually somehow home top schools America. 40 million doses? Aren‚Äôt like 55 million people 65 country? hold outs crazy stupid though, attitude harmful.

I mean, beginning advised doctor hold getting vaccine due occupation, history bad vaccine reactions, time didnt feel enough research... eventually got vaccine, 3-4 month period avoided topic could avoid dealing aggressive ""pro-vaxxers."" 

I seriously people straight accuse lying tell sorts nasty things based vaccine status time... give flying fuck, got shot doctor told believed should. totally understand people might encounter cultish aggression end getting vaccine might gotten otherwise.

I still blame Trump... hes gone now, division polarization left wake honestly scary, like there's way reconcile. *Legos  cutting corners suggests proof data suggest works. 


Look happened ivermectin HCQ etc.  People latch usefulness. France actually pretty impressive terms vaccine uptake. overall population like 75% population atleast 1 dose last time checked 88% adults atleast 1 dose. surprised remember seeing polls said France would low uptake. Probably helped they've got like vaccine passport enter restrictions etc 86% total population first shot. 12-18 94%. Same. I'm 7 months. Doubt it. Philippines enters chat.   

Alberta 82.x% vaccination rate 12+ uncontrolled spread critical levels people icu beds talks shipping icu patients province care. 

Canada 85.5% 12+ fully vaccinated. 


Sorry. I‚Äôm Canada watching provinces like Alberta Saskatchewan removing restrictions June /July pretending pandemic struggling slow explosion bringing back restrictions. 

You look USA see many children infected affected Delta increasing levels hospitalIzation age ranges. H. 


Believe like, Canada level vaccination, delta getting hand places dropped al restrictions.  


In Manitoba vaccine requirements eating inside patio restaurant, attending kids sports make mandates public indoor places schools public events. Cases remain 40-80 per day vast majority unvaccinated also make 90% hospitalization 95% icu admission (1 fuller vaccinated person icu) need end lying. eligibility form asked ""high risk"" left determine. determined high risk based level transmission state. could understand said health care worker something. lie that. technically, eligible since self determination. original interval pfizer Brazil got shortened 2 months? guys also 12 week gap like UK like Canada 14 week gap? put like that, sounds racist. (The theory, comment.)


But hady conspiracy theory ever ties racism/antisemitism? actually timeline predicted. assholes would cause massive lines trouble trying get vaccine first multiple times. Getting pissed gave single one countries.

I wish people did. work vulnerable population. It‚Äôs least do. Except science-based evidence recommended age group. recommended FDA panel concerned global supply. That's apparently reason recommended.  Honestly, worries me. J&amp;J kicked ass good 36h. think want go again. work talk lot people, hear anti-vax doctors time, I‚Äôve yet meet one. actual doctors speak couldn‚Äôt favor vaccine. observation. Ya true live world people think know everything forsure haha that‚Äôs pretty interesting. imagine importance making seem like doesn‚Äôt strong security presence number reasons like security compromised known potential threats well giving sense normalcy PM public.  nice gently explaining vaccines make die shit make get vaccinated, I'm done nice it. Vaccine mandates seem working, care anti-vaxxers think mean. Quite honestly cares point? natural spread wet market escaped lab, either China. around first cases Wuhan claim. 

Does really matter? It‚Äôs now. going anywhere soon. 

Although, Maybe enough ambulance chasers US Republicans get together class action lawsuit China give us nickel compensation‚Ä¶.. Managed convince friend mine finally get vaccinated like month ago calmly explaining vaccines work debunking claims read online. Although admiteddly one hardcore anti vaxxers refuses listen anyone. let die.  Quite major economies already. France, Canada, Australia example. clear browser history first? going see that's possible. care costs $1,000, can't run circumstances. 85% 12+. That's pretty impressive seems like every country beating US comes vaccine takeup Saw piece Forbes said 90% anti-vaxxers convinced get covid get serious case. convince someone get shot think that's case? benefit getting shot? mRNA technology around since late 80s. 30 years long term enough, guess want 100 years track record? general consensus amongst scientists public health officials natural immunity good better vaccinations.

The problem using grounds infected people receive equal freedoms infections can't easily tracked documented like vaccinations. logistically easier get everyone vaccinated. 

Another issue idiots would misconstrue info start intentionally getting infected, would exacerbate spread. government white lie say natural immunity know. people claiming stuff online despite never actually meeting her. runs less security Jon Key, Helen Clarke (Helen literally ran groceries PM like 20 years ago) really good job hidden though. NZ 27% foreign-born, compared 14% US. I'm immigrant NZ myself, US, confirm personal experience NZ massively diverse. 

NZ legally bicultural, Maori European. practice term used promote Maori culture. practice NZ multicultural. Maybe influenza problem like covid nice see someone cares jab independently work. US big people tend move likeminded people live. can't bully anyone middle lion's den. afford it, might try buying extra refill. I‚Äôve done that. insurance wouldn‚Äôt cover it‚Äôs nice spare. fairness Trump (as though even deserves it, pfft) pushing vaccination development hard president. Trump promoting idea, presumed idiotic, are. Like say, even broken clock right twice day. Unless ""a certain TV network"" Facefuck group tells do, trip see compliant. France got good vaccination rate days. See that‚Äôs somewhat decent security even PM small country doesn‚Äôt really enemies serious concerns crime/violence. That‚Äôs still pretty decent much like US President even though people trying make able personable lax security presence Wow!...that must one hell dose! 
Protection BNT162b2 Vaccine Booster Covid-19 Israel, New England Journal rate confirmed infection lower booster group nonbooster group factor 11.3 (95% confidence interval [CI], 10.4 12.3). absolute between-group difference rate confirmed infection 86.6 infections per 100,000 person-days. rate severe illness lower booster group nonbooster group factor 19.5 (95% CI, 12.9 29.5). absolute between-group difference rate severe illness 7.5 cases per 100,000 person-days. secondary analysis, rate confirmed infection least 12 days receipt vaccine substantially lower rate 4 6 days receipt (rate ratio, 5.4; 95% CI, 4.8 6.1).‚Äù mean, hopefully they‚Äôll show CDC data cases rise faster school settings aren‚Äôt mask mandates everyone done 10:05 a.m.  3 kids, two teens. 

Where live, teens give medical consent 14. can‚Äôt legally force refuse medical care 14 years old son. give consent 12 years old.

The spectators Vancouver Canucks fully vaccinated BC vaccination card program, plus indoor mask mandate. medical religious exemptions granted.

Bullying shaming ‚úÖ

I double-jabbed would urge everyone same, you‚Äôre incredibly misguided think bullying would good lead polarization already hyper-polarized landscape.

The best thing attempt persuasion sitting talking, trying bully someone making decision. Season 5 still trash tho. policy question, science question. Israel thinks mild moderate infections worth preventing, US officially supposed consider hospitalizations, partly since that's obviously dumb got clusterfuck approval broad boosters de facto everyone. cares, let land HCA medication referencing? one politician put citizens life else really cares citizens. Doesn‚Äôt yield external pressure jeopardise citizens health safety. Yes, get shot it‚Äôs gonna one hell year.  Let doesn‚Äôt wanna get vaccinated even though vulnerable go heaven probably tired world. May Rest Peace.  Fake religious exemptions easy... Oh health records indicate received every vaccine required K-12 college without claiming religious exemption, clearly belief, denied!

This comment section confusing. click??? Cant say doesn‚Äôt listen mom. unlikely varying policies vaccine. communication challenge would enormous. bodies garth.  gotten old yet? I'm fan country music YMH trolls embarrassing  degree math, thought process largely correct numbers bit off.

First, US population around 330 million, sure got 450 million.

Second, using pre-Delta numbers 99% bit low. case fatality rate (CFR) around 2%, includes official cases. infection fatality rate (IFR), pre-Delta around 0.5%. I'm assuming Delta change deaths, quite possibly bad assumption, that's best do.

Third, everyone going get COVID, despite seems. I've heard current estimate R0 around 8 Delta. means around 12.5% population never vaccinated infected. much, still something. assume vaccines protect 50% population, leaves us around 37.5% population eventually get infected. Note part bit handwavy, plenty people got infected chance vaccinated we'll end 50% population fully vaccinated, I'm making massive assumption two inaccuracies cancel out. 

Finally, put together. 330 million \* .375 percent infected \* .005 infection fatality rate gives us 618,750 deaths. already surpassed this, means either Delta deadlier pretty much towards end COVID. Unfortunately, one bit seen Delta might causing twice many hospitalization risk unvaccinated, causes twice many deaths compared Alpha, could bad. Still, really see way number deaths would go million let alone 2 million unless get strain significantly breaks immunity. parents went go get booster shot got turned down. person refused give dad vaccine according needs 75 older. mom got denied CDC supposedly sent information re-evaluating booster shot decision morning people fall groups outside made age requirement person threw out. Fair man. I'm tired able normal break cases cause higher risk toddler. people would show ER first place, would great.

Moderna's data shown better ways long term Pfizer's could due things possible they'll equal boosters (both short term 6 months 3rd dose).  course! take mask indoors why? Lol China still zero-covid. 70% population fully vaccinated (but weaker vaccines) makes cheaper, delta outbreak back July extremely expensive eliminate. think shudv clear.

I talking ptsd losing loved ones like I, many others did. wear mask whenever I'm public, near 700K deaths nothing scoff at.

Yeah thin cloth covering mouth nose 6-1/2 hours day must destroying they're psyches. recover? really, anybody working Israeli hospital would adamantly disagree. safe vaccines right now, say person getting 3rd pfizer shot next week. That‚Äôs spits Based first grader. Easier pick victim less witnesses. Touch dive bar fence Garth loved music 90s still idea means. think breakthrough infections overhyped. makes sense get booster shot immune compromised, general population think necessary right now.

See latest report DoD Medicare population covid19 sub. Breakthrough infections startlingly prevalent quite dangerous damaging, bit north 60% vaccine protection hospitalization seniors, 42% protection infection. That's similar Israel found, suggestion sharp drop-off immunity. odds ratios hospitalization 2.5 six months versus 3-4 months. That's mix Pfizer-Moderna weighted bit Moderna.

Vaccine effectiveness always expected lower elderly, clear wanes quickly. going need boosters, starting soon, winter season going frightful northeast.  r/kidsarefuckingstupid

Well maybe could roll updated guidance 14 million us got J&amp;J vaccine throw caution wind, let kids get vaccinated too. otherwise yeah, compassion fatigue real anyone vaccinated point one blame get sick. It‚Äôs like they‚Äôre fighting take many people it.   reasoning behind temporarily blocking order? articles I've read go much detail, seems like officials confident they'll able carry vaccine mandate. Outside transmission always been, continues incredibly rare. Masks outside never necessary, never necessary. Grow loser. can. course. 

But overwhelming majority: not. 

At all. 

It‚Äôs much worse even imagining right now.


And even worse that. often looking yearbook photos adult? He's good kid think might actually COVID? I‚Äôve heard (anecdotally) lot illness going around pandemic ‚Äústarted‚Äù. might say plays shows low places. something person isn‚Äôt qualified anything would say.

They see others wearing masks think ""everyone's telling well. mom it, must good."" say ""mY fReEdOm tAkEN"" ""this harmless piece cloth makes look like ninja gonna kill me!"" indulge absurd arguments they're naive pure. corrupted biased.

I'm boomer, many peers 100% me: covid safe knowledgeable, trusting science, vaccinated still masked everywhere public. Also, I've talked several young folks getting vaccinated hesitant.

The shittiest thing far conservative parents attack teachers complaining principal, superintendent, school board solely get trouble. even communicate things teacher first, 'go manager' admin/board members incompetent weaklings crumble bullies. luckily much issues MANY colleagues traumatized asshole parents (about 1-5% area, boy vocal calculated)  Honestly, divided experts are, we're lucky worse is. Hopefully moment time photo remember era. Norway sitting 67% entire population vaccinated. Canada 71%

Alberta Canada 69.7%, Norway uncontrolled spread, 1500 + cases per day ICU capacity near max... 

So.. norway less vaccinated Canada alberta yet Alberta overwhelmed removed mandates late june.

Totally agree, Alberta said 100% (not typo) recent ICU admissions unvaccinated. majority people right thing held hostage selfish minority. anything would probably spin passive-aggressive/subtle racist story narrated one edgelord pundits. surprised mortality rate people ventilators high. thought dexamethasone lowered death rate.  longer. Got flu fall 2019. chronic cough since. I've always pretty weak lungs since worked job exposed really shitty air quality, cough fun deal pandemic. least people mostly give space  argument 12k doses??

Because that's still less one-a-million I'd take odds COVID anyway visiting China (a years back, pre-COVID), everyone wears masks ill, wondered thing here, prevent spread disease.

Lo behold, new cultural trait! response would *not* getting vaccinated also ""A Decision,"" means resultant harms getting vaccinated self-inflicted, ""literal Act God."" decision makes likely transmitter deadly virus, personally view decision willful potential manslaughter.  think going see lot people realizing parents believed very, very, dumb things related COVID.

Like, right insanity gone essentially unchecked among certain segments population - 20-25 years, total freakout COVID done. vaccines clearly visibly safe probably normalized, COVID endemic (which likely be). mRNA vaccines commonplace.

Imagine 20 something 20-25 years, realizing parents took horse dewormer, refused safe effective vaccine, possibly even **died** (there several younger people dying early, leaving bunch kids). can't imagine kids realizing parents swallowed much misinformation. especially one main sources - former president.  want both? think second dude  üëñüëñüëñüëñüëñüëñ hope close polio today, horrible time period elders family remember, almost eradicated time younger ones come along.

Fox News going turn mandates bad? breath fresh air, see person something explained understand dangers make decision follow guidelines made safety. Eww Ah, sure.  good night:) Lol news? know, right? Wait till show kind stories make OAN headlines. Eep. hope immune response delayed, prevented, show antibodies soon. 

I work place (normally) 800k visitors per year. We‚Äôre still busier I‚Äôd like. It‚Äôs bad enough visiting kids unvaccinated, local stats adults good either. least they‚Äôre mostly complying mask mandate.

Every single one staff 18 year olds voluntarily fully vaccinated, months. required last month prove vaxx status show HR weekly negative test results division completely finished documentation first day. 

The younger ones said protect older immune compromised coworkers family members. moderate conservatives know vaccinated. It‚Äôs easily manipulated (I.e. dumb ones) aren‚Äôt. It‚Äôs going interesting see happens party long run.

I live fairly conservative part liberal metro area. one bitched masks mostly educated people money. go home town see crazy conservatives. don‚Äôt see two groups remain part party. 

I feel let community grew with. always thought nutty liberal, thought cared. It‚Äôs sad see misinformation done.

Jesus fucking Christ. don‚Äôt know explain I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs million dollar smile mask! Well, we‚Äôre top 5% worst things bottom 5% good things I‚Äôd say objectively yes. :(. respect man barely like country music. Honestly, whenever talk Republicans/Conservatives always think thankfully mess sort generational shift. mean, faults Internet, least people access information grew learning identify misinformation (at least case school district). Hopefully, generational shift, elderly population shrink younger population able push forth change.  fine! They're probably happy got booster begin with! consider safety mean ""not dying"" concerned substantial risk long term damage body guess long vaccine mostly safe. Sure is!  bs want loose health insurance? longer able pay rent? know eviction moratoriums increased unemployment ending ended, right? already true 'high risk' since known broad many people already jumping line back start tier opened.

Really many contradictions faulty assumptions...

Then one Dr vehemently opposed anything 65+ (Dr. Long) claiming FDA approved people high risk occupations also high risk conditions... simply false, obviously complete duplicate since that's subset approved high risk category.

Mind went college 80s continental drift really accepted totally 50s still people field questioned guess found downright odd time still do.  love fucking confused non-mommies Garth mentioned none comments make sense. Exactly this. say catch state, get medical treatment state instead clogging states hospital willful ignorance Assuming 20's, known issues, risk fairly low. Quite crazy extremist politics important Hippocratic Oath. That's great assuming need medical care reason. Unfortunately living normal life get car accident, fall break bone, develop medical condition needs treatment going getting far worse care would hospitals clogged unvaccinated people, health care workers completely burned exhausted.

If fully vaccinated risk ending hospital might lower, still get breakthough case spread unvaccinated, taking space hospitals could otherwise used people cancer, who've accidents, etc. Wait, where‚Äôs required Reddit response water isn‚Äôt wet, makes things wet? thought required make correction??    Watch waspiss!  Lots tattooed, pierced steroid using anti vaxxers. I'm thinking might actually lessen burnout staff. Unvaxxed coworkers unnecessary burden - safety hazard - them.

Sick dead workers yet another cause loss.

People feel safe (as made possible) job tend stick longer. Better treatment management would go long way well.

Considering many people vaccine hesitant want studies done potential side effects vaccines take them, considering fact vaccine free, treatment adverse reaction certainly not, believe could get vaccination least 90% could guarantee free reduced cost healthcare treatment anyone suffers adverse reaction, well anyone requires hospitalization breakthrough case. all, running risk contracting COVID hospitalized anyways, I'm sure plenty people would willing take vaccine means government would foot bill hospitalization rather pay treatment.

I feel like many people fence want put hospital pay exorbitant healthcare bills taking vaccine adverse reaction it, they're avoiding feel confident happen them. reassurance knowing doctor visits hospitalization would covered BIG incentive would ease lot concerns.

Delta also made vaccinated people likely catch spread virus wild strain variants. Still, we're far less likely catch/spread virus unvaccinated - need people get vaccinated.

Messaging conflicted jumble throughout.

Part virus new, science truly complex, knowledge inevitably evolves fits starts.

But part also due sheer ineptitude part many leaders, big part comes opposed taking *any* step shorten pandemic loud mics. many also leaders.

To me, article take whole mess full account. really answers, can't give up, either. don‚Äôt use march 2020 ‚Äúthe lowest point‚Äù two reasons:

-	it beginning pandemic us
-	it heavily tested due confusion handle everything recent uptick death

There really hasn‚Äôt been, though. drop rise deaths, mostly September 7th holiday states working/registering deaths. data stabilized, trend downwards.  may preventing others vaccinated, However preventing others getting medical care need taking space hospitals chose stay unvaccinated.

I'm tired catering idiots refuse believe science. So? Fuck em. asked nicely year half. they‚Äôre still dumb listen point, let virus take them. I'd bet half America know is. bite hand feeds? credibility.  fact US, right speak ill country. 
We shit hole. went got Pfizer booster recommendation Mayo Clinic. Mayo Clinic sent message app saying immunocompromised got J&amp;J go get Pfizer.  Thinning herd real life‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ Technically lowest March 2020. Getting back November numbers isn‚Äôt great it‚Äôs still high, happier number drops around March/April last year. 400 daily death number 146k year, way much something that‚Äôll around forever. 

There recent uptick death, doesn‚Äôt seem many breakthrough serious cases. it‚Äôs still struggle it‚Äôs getting way better 3-4K deaths day March 2021.  think seriously misunderstanding means it‚Äôs implications, that‚Äôs peak nationalism right there. Something even Trump would say. US rarely ever subscribed ideas, foreigners don‚Äôt right enter another country already controversial fucked doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs turn privilege enter another country. 

Isn‚Äôt goal pandemic freedom movement? Even within country? soon possible putting peoples lives risk? It‚Äôs removing borders wide open border policies. 

Those vaccination requirements aren‚Äôt largely effect especially it‚Äôs enforced lot people travel countries don‚Äôt get vaccine. limitation freedom movement travel those. There‚Äôs vaccine passport travel places ‚Äúrequirements‚Äù. related example: needed yellow fever vaccine travel Costa Rica required community service organization traveled through. people don‚Äôt need travel lot people even know traveled don‚Äôt need get vaccines. COVID requirements restrictions whether permanent long term whole different ball game.  blame unvaccinated people keeping us stuck neutral? Yes. Why? refuse vaccinated.

I‚Äôm first admit better smarter anyone, data backs upsetting vaccinated trusting medical community get frustrated.

What reasons people refuse get vaccinated? It‚Äôs bad don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs it.

What carnauba wax powdered cellulose? Aspirin, many people know don‚Äôt know still take aspirin?

Being selective chose put bodies okay, applying vaccine start get frustrated. past 18 months, lives millions children put hold pandemic shuttered schools, disrupted health services, kept children away relatives friends,‚Äù said Henrietta Fore, UNICEF Executive Director. ‚ÄúChildren, like us, want lives back. UNICEF believes equal access vaccines countries surest pathway pandemic. thank LEGO Foundation sharing belief hope support inspires organizations, businesses individuals generous.  date, 5.8 billion vaccine doses administered worldwide, 2 per cent administered Africa.  funds LEGO Foundation go towards supporting UNICEF‚Äôs in-country delivery administration support two doses COVID-19 vaccine 14 million people ordinary settings, 10 million people humanitarian settings.

Getting doses poorer countries become greater focus now. 5.8 billion doses administered would minimum 2.9 billion fully vaccinated people accomplishment.  Why? 23 It‚Äôs funny think January today vaccination. Early year pretty confident would vaccinate everyone year people saying optimistic.

Look now. That‚Äôs say perfect, course. president opportunity buy vaccines earlier chose to. I‚Äôm happy happened. This. LeBron influence NBA current commissioner players. LeBron said won‚Äôt play every player vaccinated, would immediate mandate resistance would melt away. becomes unreasonable stupid evidence points it‚Äôs efficacy safety it‚Äôs possible side effects. point approved vaccines, plenty studies, millions people vaccinated. credibility. stuffed Ebola Ziki COVID people finally realizing potential world health organization reality entirely different things. Waste money. 21? Cdc says get Covid vaccines time, even time flu vaccines.   Yes, mostly wanted faster results. publicly administered, found bigger intervals better efficacy, made countries like Canada, uk Brazil use three months interval. also helped vaccine shortage, way could apply first doses leave future doses second doses.

Nowadays, Brazil shortening pfizer two months, mostly everyone vaccinated studies shown little difference efficacy two three months. people save guy drowning river city, know well built characters. Correct. 

This one times though, willful ignorance refusing change minds stupid.

Did know cars sulfuric acid them? would argue dangerous vaccine type (mRNA) development couple decades, COVID pushed hump terms getting widely available. see lot people driving cars though.  title stupid. can't find something already expected. proof. simple application scientific method. 

I hate type headlines. makes scientists look dumb useless. someone come say ""well duh"".

The CDC found it, proven historical data modeling. Proof either taken seriously ridiculed anyone taken ""sience"" school. reasons crazy/stupid/easily disproven.  Exactly. saw another article gave another sparkle hope besides one; global citizen united Africa's CDC donation live program. Building covid free world, one block time. ooooo okay, thank you!!! He's evil regardless numbers currently  Flu shot great fucking idiot goes way high injects shoulder socket causing hives body. 

Pay attention person giving shot fuck up. really amazing progress short time. Pretty soon COVID become US problem due stupid anti vaxxers 7 day moving average cases 17.651 dropping. lowest since pandemic started 16.221, November last year.

Our 7 day moving average deaths 527 dropping. lowest registered since pandemic started around 300-400 November. use emergency services recently?

The World Health Organization reviving stalled investigation origins Covid-19 virus agency officials warn time running determine pandemic killed 4.7 million people world-wide began.

A new team 20 scientists‚Äîincluding specialists laboratory safety biosecurity geneticists animal-disease experts versed viruses spill nature‚Äîis assembled mandate hunt new evidence China elsewhere.

Washington allies urging WHO, United Nations‚Äô public-health arm, push ahead probe. China resisted, arguing new inquiry focus countries, including U.S.

The possibilities new team charged examining include whether Covid-19 virus could emerged lab, according officials, hypothesis especially angered China.

The new effort comes months another WHO-led inquiry visited Wuhan, Chinese city site first confirmed Covid-19 outbreak December 2019. final report, team said data provided Chinese scientists mission insufficient answer critical questions when, virus began spreading.

Biden administration officials, including Secretary State Antony Blinken, pressed Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus publicly privately renew inquiry, likely include least one American.

The initiative, described officials Western diplomats notices, represents fresh attempt advance investigation agency‚Äôs staff said risks running time evidence blood samples thrown away. Antibodies earliest Covid-19 victims fading undetectable levels.

The new Scientific Advisory Group Origins Novel Pathogens permanent panel help investigate future outbreaks identify human activities raise risk emergence new diseases.

As part mission, take charge probe origin current pandemic.

The previous WHO-selected team 10 foreign experts visited Wuhan recommended Chinese counterparts analyze blood banks, test farmworkers scrutinize earliest suspected cases. Since then, China hasn‚Äôt said whether undertaken work. original team disbanded.

In press conference last month, officials said aware new studies conducted China, weren‚Äôt informed specifics. isn‚Äôt clear studies made available new team.

For months, China‚Äôs government insisted public, private meetings Dr. Tedros, studies origins virus focus countries, Italy, U.S. military bioresearch facility Fort Detrick, Md. Dozens governments aligned China sent Dr. Tedros letters support Beijing‚Äôs position, person familiar letters said.

A spokeswoman U.S. Army Medical Research Institute Infectious Diseases didn‚Äôt respond requests comment. Few, any, scientists outside China see military base plausible ground zero pandemic. Dr. Tedros resisted idea investigating Fort Detrick, person knowledge conversations said.

It isn‚Äôt clear new team, whose members officials say chosen end week, able fly experts China make significant progress resolving origins debate long deadlock remains.

A spokesman said new team‚Äôs ‚Äúpriority needs data access country first reports identified.‚Äù

The Chinese government declined say whether would allow new team country. foreign ministry said statement China ‚Äúcooperated fully‚Äù previous inquiry.

On Tuesday, Chinese President Xi Jinping told U.N. General Assembly ‚ÄúChina continue support engage global science-based origins tracing stands firmly opposed political maneuvering whatever form.‚Äù

China plans closely monitor WHO‚Äôs selection new team, foreign ministry said, Beijing put forth number individuals part it. Chinese authorities heavily conditioned choice original WHO-led team sign final report.

The selection new larger team, drawn wider range countries areas expertise, could serve isolate China diplomatically government continues rebuff pressure, said Lawrence Gostin, faculty director O‚ÄôNeill Institute National Global Health Law Georgetown University.

‚ÄúThe question is, enough?‚Äù said. ‚ÄúChina still holds cards, lacks power it‚Äôs inconceivable new committee able negotiate access China‚Ä¶This building beautiful committee nowhere go.‚Äù

The dispute whether China conduct WHO-recommended research origins virus causes Covid-19 become point contention Beijing Biden administration, tried rally allies supporting new effort. President Biden Mr. Xi discussed issue call ahead last week‚Äôs U.N. General Assembly.

Dr. Tedros seeking second term WHO‚Äôs director-general, U.S. support seen critical chances.

The WHO‚Äôs new effort investigate origins pandemic comes U.N. agency increasingly aligned Washington‚Äôs top priorities since Biden administration reversed President Donald Trump‚Äôs decision leave it.

Those include concerted effort determine whether lab accident could sparked pandemic.

The first WHO-led team scientists concluded ‚Äúextremely unlikely‚Äù virus escaped lab. Dr. Tedros since said hypothesis requires scrutiny team‚Äîwhich spent hours one Wuhan‚Äôs many research centers working coronaviruses‚Äîwas able muster.

Those scientists now-disbanded team allowed apply new team. However, competing hundreds applications, due Sept. 17, including several world‚Äôs prominent virologists.

Peter Ben Embarek, Danish food-safety specialist led first team, didn‚Äôt respond text messages seeking comment.

It took year pandemic began original team get visas permission enter China, repeatedly delayed probe saw attempt assign blame.

Once there, scientists WHO-led team said weren‚Äôt given raw data early suspected Covid-19 patients; Chinese researchers conducted antibody tests patients long tests would reliable; Chinese researchers appeared concentrated animal testing species aren‚Äôt susceptible virus, chickens.

After visit, team recommended testing animals China traders deal wild farmed mammals susceptible Covid-19. Yet China‚Äôs government shut farms across large regions, making much harder‚Äîperhaps even impossible‚Äîto establish whether Covid-19 virus spread humans via species, many scientists say. Even getting COVID knowing someone died doesn‚Äôt seem change everyone‚Äôs mind think disagreed fact..  Wow. idea remastered it. wasn‚Äôt originally. booster moderna submitted data flu Covid combined one. booster get approved fall Covid one won‚Äôt get ‚Äútwo flu shots‚Äù 1080p... kid refused take mask photographer trying get picture. author writes ‚Äúbe less threatening, as: ""If floss already, keep good work. flossing, might good time start.""

[Vaccines overwhelmingly long term side [COVID frequently [There 6,000,000,000 doses given since [testing began March vaccine safe. nearly bad COVID).

""Albiet"" lot coming vaccinated people spreading virus

[Vaccinated people spread disease would seem select variants/viruses avoid vaccine.

Yes vaccine selects try fight vaccine. [Seeing unvaccinated people create seems like getting people vaccinated create less mutations. Even ditch masks retain cautious behaviors public dealing others, that'd win.

I'd love physical contact people public (like handshakes) never came back, instinctively give space public careful coughing/handling stuff, we'll better off. behaviors ingrained collective subconsciousness.

So many people used act like viruses big deal made *zero* effort prevent spread. Going work sniffling sneezing? That's longer ""brave"" ""tough"" firmly ""asshole"" behavior. Short deadly several negative side effects, apparently sterility one them. Cleaning deplorable gene pool horsey paste. Awesome. think neat picture 20 years. Everyone know year taken  correct I‚Äôm wrong, made vaccination effort go fast able produce vaccines, don‚Äôt think Indonesia power so.

Two used vaccines made Brazil. AstraZeneca produced Brazilian lab Fiocruz Sinovac produced Brazilian lab Butant√£.

This really helped, since don‚Äôt wait vaccines come overseas, bottleneck lot months year. One friends want vaccinate, claiming ""they rushed it"".

Me guys bullied so. even said getting invited hang pandemic meant it.

Now says bad side effects. I'll take predictions advice grain salt. 'Back normal' predictions actual experts off. Getting back normal requires us vaccinated. \#1 cause police deaths! solution getting employer sponsor sponsor me? Yeah, that's true... imo ""aggressive progressive"" shit seeing adding fuel fire.

I'm honestly surprised didnt return reddit find 1k downvotes bunch aggressive replies first comment lol ...what? really hope reevaluate approach - least younger kids get vaccinated. Good God! That's just...awful. acquaintance ever shown signs mental illness? major league delusion her/his part. dad got flu 3 years row one time. hits like truck feel truly awful least 2 weeks. One time bad, care died right miserable. never want get flu!  Thank this! plenty research, adult children vaccinated. continue mask, sanitize,social distance avoid crowds. possibility vector another could die great, let alone risk oneself. 

Many us ‚Äúboomers‚Äù tuned in, so, younger demographics. Covid killed 8 21 officers died California thought Brazil really Trump-style fight mitigations, ignore virus, push fake cures nonsense. social pressure vaccinate US? genuinely impressive, considering baboon president. Yeah true, one‚Äôs forced. don‚Äôt know precautions take. stop Tell they're giving vaccines jobs Mexicans.

That'll make storm hospitals get vaccinated. Another way looking Pfizer may gearing current boosters, perhaps boosters rest population, annual shots, planning series ""boosters"" frequently year. Scientists mentioned year idea before, likening annual flu shots, except perhaps risk getting annual Covid shot. point, they're sharing instructions get loved ones released hospice care they're convinced hospitals killing putting vents instead prescribing you-know-what.

So say start releasing folks AMA *second* push back standard medical treatment watch ICUs empty people self-triage. need shield medical providers legal liability letting grown-ass adults make poor decision, make happen.  issue way you‚Äôve always done even spite pandemic. due respect profession, school photos important someone‚Äôs life. 

None kids taking masks indoors. Sadly, people prioritize things like school photos safety allow kids make masking exceptions. 

It‚Äôs terrible though young child trying right thing stay safe forced adults endanger health health loved ones photo. easy, safe alternatives. 

Airborne transmission means covid hangs air. means kid catch covid simply area near someone covid was.

Don‚Äôt teach basic chemistry high school longer? shot guarantees they'll get sick least 24-36 hrs. unreasonable concern IMO. shot also puts risk blood clots, myocarditis, irregular periods, Guillane-Barr, etc..... Yes risks extremely small percentage wise matter them. getting shot means risk things zero. would take shot puts small risk myocarditis could get risk zero (in minds) get benefits get got shot?  highly vaccinated. Cases low relative could been. Eg look alpha wave pre vaccine. Delta would worse.

So case numbers actually low. infected vaccine protect spread. basically slow burning rather exploding exponentially. Hence low levels former Victoria‚Äôs Secret model. restrictions whatsoever, mean pretty wild terms varying case rates. good thing people arent hospitalised, figure almost 1000 week.

The fact happening go Autumn good sign, many people vaccinated numbers cases dont matter anymore. back normal here, days even forget thing also high cases probably, people hugging shaking hands again, many wear masks, bound go up.

**No** testing, **no** universal masking anywhere, **no** vaccine requirement. 

And **nowhere near** 90% fully vaccinated. cute lol. Well picture remember least! What? weak justification, imo. 

Those age group 0.002% dying contracting flu. poop, Poirot. definitely tried supportive every way could think of. told vaccinator let see needle, tell coming, call us back ready shot. let squeeze hell hand put one eyes even though turned away belittle reaction. knew would hardest thing he's do. give ultimatum getting see people die every day deal stress worrying dying anymore knowing could better chance got shot. I'm apologized basically guilting something terrified I'm relieved me. Ya think so? various charts find internet difference cold flu, two big ones 

1) muscle aches pretty common influenza. feeling like muscles, especially large muscles like quadriceps, feeling like sore pain 

2) noticeably feverish day ( sweating, hot touch, chills, etc)

Also, I'm describing necessarily severe influenza. Severe influenza would like get hospital, potentially pneumonia. run mill influenza makes feel like utter ick  kids did!!! CDC know governors don‚Äôt know?  vax 8 mil ppl day. Im sure spare 1 day....... Low loose That‚Äôs interesting family UK saying differently. Hospitals full, major worker shortage, high infections etc Always love hear guy Covid safe hides bodies easier less people around see. Slick Stuff, Cool Stuff. Lol I‚Äôm saying idk isn‚Äôt newsworthy news needs gloom, ok get dopamine hit something positive every while. bodies G? laughed loud freedom fridges. Probably going straight hell, yet cuz I'm vaccinated, bitches!! Hashtag ‚úåüèª‚úåüèªhappy What? SORTA.. Astra Zeneca used post-fusion form spike protein (when streched out). guess lock onto pre-fusion spike well hence poorer neutralizing immunity.. AZ produced better t-cell response means blowing cells, plus t-cell response lifelong (except elderly may never develop due lack naive t-cells). bra face like mask? thats resourceful. real, theses big babies would rather sacrfice kids kids grandparents health defy political team messaging. Theres also loudmouth batshit crazy ones make seem like whole community wack. funny thing group hardcore get kids back school (which agree done safely) fighting masks, distancing, quarantine recs, theyre likely miss days school likely shuttered temporarily. This. going make argument different comment trying start argument. feel like barely different kids wear school uniform, pajama day Thursday. another thing, like it, really give shit either. parents/school say wear mask, wear it. Mine one wearing weeks without mandate state.. left (because school mandate we're trying force kids hostile bullying). go store sighs putting on, puts without actual hesitation. know I'm probably paranoid here, could get trouble? work hospital, heard rumor super easy get boosters (this FDA CDC approval). went past Tuesday, asked could get Pfizer booster (I previously gotten Pfizer), issues. gave me. fill booster release, nothing immunocompromised. signed it, got booster moved on, put date card. use insurance, since job. 

Am going get trouble needlessly paranoid? I've heard lot people getting boosters somehow approval (lying getting lucky pharmacy, multiple hospitals offering boosters early). story? 
We pictures kids iron lungs polio pandemic. Lol. isn‚Äôt shit.  I'll take ""Colors Red"", Alex would true could ever get Trump judge. Giuliani done, since Trump threw bus. Oh great, maybe we‚Äôll get access technology 15-20 years time already vaccinated 6 weeks? What? Cool, thank you! news water still wet ignoring getting flu symptoms could disruptive getting flu sucks (what people said), read article couple months ago flu shot may provide long term protection certain strains come back around again. I'm sure well proven is, idea getting exposure strains every year end getting bad version going around years may pre-existing immunity. Maybe start putting extra bodies offices FDA. know, FDA employees don‚Äôt seem think it‚Äôs important show work. ~~that scales back rights vaccinated~~ kindling anti-vaxx movement

There, fixed you. Antivaxxers maskless freaks care rights all. Kudos both.  family role model.  Well say let conversation begin That‚Äôs awesome!

People fed up, covid ripped unvaxxed, mask mandates aren‚Äôt going last. Worst case scenario back normal spring. Yet every school board meeting parents shouting terrible masks are. infuriating. kids fine wearing masks, ideal adjust super fast. parents, hand, act wearing mask equivalent torture. bra uncomfortable mask, need get it. Savage hahaha Touch camera fence Actually conservative Christians seem bothered mass graves mass deaths. Proaly wind memorable school photo too. People look back &amp; look 90s/80s/70s/etc outfits saying *""wow can't believe wore that, remember ##s?""*. Anyone ever dates marries including parents take one look &amp; ""wow... brings back memories... remember covid? Lets tell stories"" San Francisco don‚Äôt understand. GOP‚Äôs base generally older hence vulnerable virus. It‚Äôs also declining base Gen Z overwhelmingly progressive thinking.

Instead actively keeping base alive, they‚Äôre kill off. It‚Äôs weird. Yeah, 100%. I'm confident I've even actually flu adult. said, wised benefits flu shot last year (had one previously adult) committed getting annually. saw edit. Yes it‚Äôs smart get flu shot. really really sucks. you‚Äôve never gotten doesn‚Äôt mean won‚Äôt. **that** many people get flu every year. Maybe 5%-10% population given year. might get every 20 years - I‚Äôm math right. infrequency coming it, lead people thinking ‚Äúthey never get flu‚Äù, kind true! leads people think immune system protecting them, reality it‚Äôs luck draw.

School districts sure taking time decisions, especially school still one biggest risks kids. month since vaccines approved teens, least sixteen older, think would planned something summer.

Is limiting number days kids go school even closing schools option? Water wet. Sky blue. breaking news 10... conspiracy Florida alters manipulates data support narrative  Many seem bring precedents vaccine mandates, worry anyone.  Good hear, honestly. met Europeans years passed understood much Australia everything apparently wanting kill you. Hopefully pressure international embarrassment leads change.  Keep feathering brother families need closure G! Please right thing touch camera fence never got flu vaccine got flu. 24 amazing shape time weight lifting. legitimately thought going die, sick two weeks didnt leave bed. flu serious kills people, even really young healthy people. get vaccine want risk getting flu. I'm 31 recently diagnosed autoimmune condition, getting flu scares me. mention lot Americans likely undiagnosed illnesses conditions due unhealthy lifestyle. Nice. third shot practically side effects. day after, arm got little bit stiff/tender moved much while. 

Myocarditis extremely rare, bother modifying behavior past 15 minutes getting shot. still relevant risk-benefit calculations though (especially weird way totally ignore ""mild"" long covid, worse myocarditis seem equate hospitalization covid), particularly Moderna young males without high-risk occupation pre-existing conditions risk myocarditis likely higher higher dose benefits third dose less effectiveness second dose healthy young people low risk direct harm covid (by ""only hospitalizations/deaths matter"" criteria), even though group susceptible indirect effects poverty caused illness due less/no PTO, savings, etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

I got third dose week ago, 6 months second. pay attention much supply available individual getting shot going meaningfully affect supply. FDA/CDC way cautious. Millions people different COVID vaccines (it seems though Canada, one, normal AZ first shot Pfizer second). Prime Minister Canada, Chancellor Germany others people note mixed vaccines. evidence dangerous ineffective.  Ok Ralph. counting going recieve vaccine point (those 12).

Norway's status is:

Fully vaccinated:

* 18+ - 84.4% 
* 16+ - 82.4% (13.8% 16-17 year olds)
* 12+ - 80.7% (52.2% 12-15 year olds)

One jab:

* 18+ - 91.2%
* 16+ - 91.1% (87.4% 16-17 year olds)
* 12+ - 89% (52.2% 12-15 year olds)

In couple weeks Norway 91% - 95% entire population vaccinated point. There's point keeping country restrictions point. appreciate respectfully, don‚Äôt get option make claims study clearly don‚Äôt understand. actually relevant data study could make case  I'm anti vaccine anti mask. I'm one thinks keeping immune system strong enough need ""vaccine."" mind wearing mask periods public non invasive. OP also perception Ireland.  fighting masks, distancing, quarantine recs, theyre likely miss days school likely shuttered temporarily.

Except places decided like Mayor Vaughn Jaws keep going matter what.  disagree? basis?  Masking imperfect even people wear 100% time (which not). mean entirely ineffective reducing spread.  Wow! Who'd've thought? gon sleep tree days baaabbyy Really?!   Hard say ever left. saying from? can't speak fellow Americans know Murdoch muppet takes vacations national crises lies pretends sexual assault NBD that's pretty much line Murdoch muppets. Hopefully new variant. respectfully disagree  not? already require vaccines go school.   common sense. 

Many arguments disingenuous.

A mask captures fine aerosol mist exhale (wear mask outside winter -- amount ""steam"" see reduced. ) person asymptomatic presymptomatic exhaling mask, less Covid carrying aerosol pushed air around them

Excepting really good masks like N-95s etc, even ordinary cloth surgical mask give protection wearer --- capturing aerosol particles come contact with. less viral particles get someone's nose, better chances. 

Yes, viral particle fit microscopic holes mask. aerosols carry virons catch fabrics same. live Auckland. right. kid secretly like wearing masks hides face like face Sweaty masked beards big problem kids though. least huge problem summer last year. year managed adapt.
 
(context: live Spain heat... Yeah)  processes reason vaccines rolled late summer last year even though initial phases trials showed really well.

Maybe something rethought future. Maybe virus much higher CFR contagious COVID-19 absolutely make preparations ""cut corners"" case. Sometimes *need* act faster scientists gathered enough data give recommendation feel comfortable with. fucked up, poor kid. perception returned prison island roots. I've seen even ones young understand importance pretty co-operative them, seem get used easily adults, plus want one everyone else one. Well go vaccine, uh, ‚Äúskeptical‚Äù life used every excuse sun oppose masks. includes actual medical professionals going onto YouTube saying masks don‚Äôt prevent spread coronavirus unless everyone using particular type mask blocks aerosols. 


But get blank stares point infection rates plummeting schools institute enforce masking policies. Coronavirus aside, probably works well keeping sorts stuff bay one simple reason; kids can‚Äôt easily put fingers around noses mouths. 


I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll hear start saying ‚Äúcorrelation doesn‚Äôt equal causation‚Äù response research article, right point Ivermectin miracle cure whatever. folks childish children schools actually wearing masks. Oh found quite reliable look happens Australia predictor flu season UK. Last year record low happened here. year lowest incidence flu record Australia first time ever zero deaths recorded. I'm thinking though strict quarantine visitors may catching cases early skewing rate. Even shot scheduled Tuesday. interesting see plays out. WRONG!! Literally pull PEER reviewed study. I‚Äôm literally getting tired misinformation spread.

Yea, surprised money made. say take money good product need. get angry product exists today.  reply? I‚Äôm old, remember Reagan firing air traffic controllers.

This high stakes issue. Hospitals won‚Äôt able back without exposing civil liability lawsuits patients get COVID unvaccinated staff. Ah cool, also explains given single dose. Thanks.

It makes sense allow natural immunity status vaccinated, guess harder register put database infected. Also guess New Zealand many infections, big priority.  Whoa, whoa, whoa‚Ä¶how true? Masks don‚Äôt work, I‚Äôve seen memes memes never lie. Hippies, energy frequency another example comes mind thing finally f-ed whole new age bs proof show listens mom. Plenty parents give children flu shot. always did. Many pediatricians encourage it. main reason opinion schools petri dishes flu season hits, kids get sick, parents relatives get sick (including vulnerable elderly relatives live care children), teachers staff go droves, leaving schools scrambling substitutes. worked school every winter we'd flu, strep, Coxsackie, etc. hit waves misery staff shortages interrupted children's learning. Flu public health hazard makes life difficult parents school staff, especially parents little paid time off. 

 work five days week public; I'm vaxxed suspect I'll get COVID eventually, I'm sitting home biting nails it. firmly believe children get COVID vaccine protect people everyone get back work/regular life, especially single parents grandparents raising grandchildren own. parents opt children get COVID vaccine? Probably not, I'm never surprised people reveal shortsighted self-absorbed. got flu shot booster arm last month. Nothing special.  Tanzania requires yellow fever vaccine enter actually. get vaccine enter decade ago. vaccine covid vaccine made sick (and yellow fever vaccine intense actually). I‚Äôm quite sure better catching yellow fever!!!  see experienced glory Alsace wines. Gewurtztraminer, Riesling, absolute beauty bottle. taste 'fruit sweet' meaning taste liquid sweet, delicate fruitiness, dry wine alcohol dries inside cheeks. dump load sugar get sweetness like cheap ros√©, that's flavour grapes planning travel NYC winter, I‚Äôm second thoughts.   what, use language?   long antibodies last natural immunity. know recommend people COVID get vaccinated 12 post-recovery. Religion plays part too. forever grateful lives saved. well true. Although I'm saying parent here. yes correct. 40$???? registered besos dealer buying from? Mine charges 55.99$   shouldnt news good luck! Touch camera fence bud bestie ICU nurse small town, every year cares people hospitalized flu. die, there‚Äôs always *at least* one among young otherwise healthy. started getting flu shot 5 years ago‚Ä¶it doesn‚Äôt kill old people. &amp; yet still sucks &amp; massively overrated. first grader care that. mom told ""keep mask except eat"" that. He's considering nuance Googling statistics CDC's website influence decisions.  lot crossover two groups. guess it‚Äôs easier make conspiracy theory stop eating Twinkies. brother law sounds pretty cool, never think this! many lost opportunities! Think get away next drivers license?  ‚ÄúI‚Äôll show asking super specific question ridiculous parameters absolutely meaning assessing learning children.‚Äù

That you. You‚Äôre telling everyone idea you‚Äôre talking without saying idea you‚Äôre talking about. 

Wander let people trained things handle it. You‚Äôre getting way distractions. momma woulda known‚Ñ¢ Survive! Yeah agree long adults required wear I'll keep saying dumb let little kid take seconds picture. agree adults wearing masks going store, shopping mall. seeing many places. fair new york hospitals okay right really running space still. People masking up. transitioning?   news? mean, not. people taking masks willy nilly.  I'm ""just leave damn thing camp"", whereas people take em drop hat.  

Want talk?  Take mask.  Gotta sneeze?  Take off. People crazy.  special individual thinks special even though hundreds thousands Americans dead that's people count.  

If people like kid we'd helluva lot better.  People know respect highly saying thing, scares me. could agree sentiment more. Okay, bigot. Go whine sub caters language police. We‚Äôre trying talk coronavirus here. Savvy?  let vaccinated people walk around shopping malls concerts without mask even though vaccinated people still spread virus. 

This exactly people need wear masks. *some* governors still require masks, *some schools* still require masks, CDC recommends wearing masks.

The delta implants nose, lot antibodies easy spread. That's wear masks. I‚Äôm 30 years old chronic kidney disease scheduled booster exactly 6 months second dose. I‚Äôm also getting flu shot time (first time literal YEARS). Wish luck. ‚ÄúYou mean I‚Äôm BEHAVIN‚Äô‚Äù Absolutely heartless vermin preying poor man like that.   families want closure. third last Saturday. abundance caution set aside bike today, went bit ripper today, 3 half hours lots variation, hard pushes hills etc. weirdness heart rate, power/heart rate decoupling. then, three shots sore arm 3 days that's it.

I kept track State's vaccination web site. 300k doses hand, current vaccination rate 20k week. felt OK getting 3rd 5 month mark. Well, hope covid distant memory least reason grief Garth Brooks. 

His goofy emo alter ego, hand ... need keep simple. It‚Äôs confused already. Moderna booster EUA almost certainly mirror Pfizer. Moderna submitted data week Pfizer, hearing approval day now. didn‚Äôt follow proto buddy you‚Äôre done!! telling helps feel better, go proud school picture grows up.

Good young student. photo remember. listened mother. Nice boy. üòÅ  country exactly small niche; he's Drake ahead Kanye West Justin Bieber overall best selling time list. Three freshman small college work killed last year. least could show slighted human decency empathy, asshole ""Remember Herman Cain awards?"" Better healthy/alive face photo! Garth Brooks dive bar would pretty awesome. wasn‚Äôt vaccinated would get vaccinated jam.  probably flaws

Her government failed deliver certain promises, individual living Auckland, never seen heard anything flawed (hell, DJ'ed student bar back MP). irony being, course, refusal get vaccinated things become extreme. ""Where bodies Garth"" one quotes actually related Garth. Stuff like ""touch camera fence"", ""waspess"", ""hey Christina"" completely unrelated Garth. YMH fans quoting show fans laugh normal people confused. really fun clicking Covid related Garth post Reddit seeing nothing inside joke comments. stupid, support mom saying wear mask times, refuse take school picture would take like 2 minutes max take? Gtfo Same. daughter gave attitude camp stopped requiring masks indoors, insisted keep wearing it. explained want wear safety safety others, much trouble could stay home instead.

She's great since. Keeping real. effective piece cloth protects others. need act like petulant child it. ""Kid grows thinking bad show face public"" problems sir I‚Äôm fan kid. Listens parent.

She‚Äôs done therapy learned relaxation techniques course. Can‚Äôt avoid needles you‚Äôre hospitals. clue Reddit, r/spacedicks r/superbowl, primary news source.

If using site news, then, like, wow. 

NPR.org  Can't ship anti vaxxers island something? Getting sick disease deadly even vaccine regularly serious side effects, makes sense give kids. 

If disease dangerous all, people take vaccine. risk calculus uses statistics bring up.

For example, parents give children flu shots. Covid influenza kill children 3 digit figures year. parents vaccinate kids influenza, especially 5, despite safe, studied decades, really side effects sore arm. Schools require kids get influenza vaccine, btw.

I think get I'm saying. I'm saying vaccine dangerous. I've said repeatedly isn't. I'm saying covid also notably dangerous minors parents hard time deciding highly unlikely event worry about, indecision favors status quo vaccinating. think judging weird it.

You avoid fear mongering projecting. really seems shadow boxing someone here. clue Delta virus works, you? see picture anything sad.   still get penalties like losing driving privileges failing background checks , yes. That's real r/SLPT you. I'd tell kid, ""If someone tells pull take mask, tell **no.**."" That's good kid right there! think delta waves hit across globe shows effective vaccines are‚Ä¶

This variant far contagious hits far harder original variant. Yet many countries past delta wave many countries, delta wave wasn‚Äôt even worst wave pandemic. 

Also note Japan drastically increased vaccination numbers, delta wave currently plummeting. Nashville night supposed play huge stadium got rained out. July. Good painful accurate odd sounds. shave every day.

Keep high tight. photo meme reason kind read like think talking point pretty bs tired moment elaborate take win stranger good night New Zealanders use leftover British imperialism. TIL. Water wet  Mine 4 simply wears mask he's told to. recently moved preschool wears day. big deal. Norway almost 80% full population vaccination. hospitals longer struggling capacity, ICU numbers low falling, vaccination numbers still climbing rapidly. Almost one dying. Even though people still getting sick longer problem. university (in US) almost entirely vaccinated we've person since Sept. 1 capacity restrictions (but restrictions student events) we've 1 student positive case past month. said, city leans toward cautious (by US standards course) masks still required campus, even though everyone vaccinated.  HORROR covid hopefully distant memory. Even still covid, generation should/could control. Hopefully. /sigh people also free vaccinate though. rate anyone wants shot got one. chaos comes people understanding whether get booster requirements complex vague. vax sites inundated people trying figure they're eligible, often hard question answer. supposed tell someone kind job qualifies? Many people want health professional tell them, figure own. even gotten difference 'may get one based individual assessment risk' vs. 'recommended get one'... many people think need doctors note.

And trusting valid... arbitrary vague recommendations  Kids flexible resilient. also understand complex ideas require change empathy... clearly lot adults can't. Idk feeling justice? Social pressure? Fairness? Peer interaction, care ones self other? pretty prevalent ages, maybe that's part it? really know kids understand one single sentence can't take peanut butter school like Deep South location, funerals spaced spread out. Saw obituaries former kindergarten teacher died COVID. Funeral?  ""a remembrance ceremony viewing"" October 30!  They're keeping folks ice long.

Assuming early 20's already extremely low risk getting sick virus. say vaccinated assuming are. around people 80-90% vaccinated low risk.

You overthinking this. minimal risk, go school enjoy classes time. might require wear masks certain indoor settings.   Well listen almost nothing punk death metal I'll still belt 'Friends Low Places' hear jukebox. don‚Äôt stingy  Phobia real, times u can't even find logical explaination it. Saying Denmark. Certain states track report like home state Rate per 100,000 Fully vaccinated: Partially vaccinated: Unvaccinated: 9/18/2021, 5,021,157 Virginians fully vaccinated COVID-90. people, 0.5% developed COVID-19, 0.021% hospitalized, 0.0054% died.

Other states like Oklahoma provide weekly see changed Delta become dominant. Cases among unvaccinated gone 99% 96%, still vast majority among unvaccinated still 20 Please don‚Äôt judge me. got vaccinated COVID soon could spring. I‚Äôve never gotten flu shot adult I‚Äôm scared getting Guillan Barre. still fence whether get flu shot year. perception definitely good. news makes sound like rapidly becoming dystopian there.  live right road cda, Washington.. pretty people extremely conservative. locals bit anti-tourist dependent tourism. love pot ""want keep illegal keep hippies out"".

Pretty dumb bunch.

Paging Ric Romero, paging Ric Romero... jab requirement probably good idea, people pay get certificate without getting vaccinated vaccinated people still get sick infect others (however unlikely).

So jab + PCR/antigen probably best bet. What? What's going headline? ""vaccinate COVID exams disruption"" -- ""vaccinate COVID combat exams disruption"" live next county refuses mandate masks schools year. many kids quarantine emergency meeting...where decided stop contact tracing quarantine positive cases, everyone contact them.

So stupid. Pretty simple. Can‚Äôt play home games, get half paycheck.
