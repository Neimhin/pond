Happy Cake Day! ü•≥ could cook, u bum lol

Edit: don‚Äôt yell people. imagine want. think it‚Äôs hilarious people pity life choices choose stay way complain everything, rather evolve those, behind valve, replaceable filters change get home rotate every 10 days. Easiest thing mask dont touch face get home disinfect hands everything bring in.  Trump, republicans still support him. Sad say, pulling together making sacrifices common good seem something country capable of. something simple putting mask help keep community safe healthy can't even agreed upon, lost. one side other, lost. US 100% correct say whatever fuck Russian vaccine. wipe going touch porous/rough surfaces.

They great flat surfaces, like table shopping trolley handle, anything cantaloupe melon. I? I? purpose? Again. 500lbs lard-o's 200 years ago genetic?
What load.


If someone fat purely due genetics, DAMN good genetics survival. genetics clearly putting stuff body regular sized people body needs little energy function..... would really aided hunter gatherers survival. us 'fast' metabolisms would inneficient compete, starving out. superior specimens storing energy.



Or maybe got fat.... try GOP wanted protections corporations? back forth I've lost track bad managed. Like congress charge spending senate republican majority republican white house finger wave say ""nuh uhhh get nice things! ""

I'd love government gave two fucks us. get wrong, dems innocent this. lesser two evils pretty wide gap two. Trumps focus despite lies pandemic, focused towards election, unfortunately words really affect minds americans including governors. mentioned axios interview, people listen him, yet keeps saying shit leads deaths. 160k+ deaths mid aug. hell come rate thermometers accurate states walled rest world

Good thing national strategy eh hear man. Stay safe Aside fact treatments helpful, he‚Äôs acting like stuff available Americans, truth he‚Äôs working make sure people won‚Äôt able get treatments without paying CEO‚Äôs bonus. case period 100 days, someone would gone hospital least dr tested. think lot people virus fatigue now

I tired vile republicans pretending failed every front possible. Good move. happens let religion take over. Shut borders mainland would good first step. Okay, here's honest opinion this. Personally, think decision done governors. keep talking polarization. best way get people take vaccine demonstration. Let people talk money. state requires it, let them. another state doesn't, let them. easy pick losing states even right now. They'd rather take extreme longshot it'll work versus getting owned libs.

There's ""longshot."" There's gonna teachers maybe parents dying. 

But anything pretend Trump's advice worthwhile. lab classes still person. ""just excuse"" would find something less expensive less logistically difficult do. people vaccinated, safer everyone. everyone able vaccinated, depend rest society vaccinate, protected possible. used hardly cases measles reported since vaccine came out...over last several years anti-vaxxers rise see cases popping again. It‚Äôs fucking scary. Gee wonder half. guys realize stock market keeps going covid cases keep going up? Stop covid, stop stonks someone different country ""in America"" get take offense people calling US America. name. Yes possible, completely feasible currently handful last stage. administration disproportionately fall upon minorities poor. people know vaccines work? don‚Äôt make grow third leg. worst case scenario doesn‚Äôt work. way, it‚Äôs Russia‚Äôs best interest provide nonfunctional vaccine. It‚Äôs actually best interest provide working one. US greatest death toll earth would mercy forever. might be. Certainly precautions taken. hope work them. interested following either way. State governments held liable blatant lies callousness NOW, would vaccine available? Imagine world‚Äôs average intelligence COVID! gonna happen someone dies. They're still desperately trying pretend Trump's ravings ""one side debate"" desperate delusions madman. think I‚Äôll save phone use needed. totallyfuckingbelievable. long return feudal system. *sighs wistfully* Woman? look like one. Look headlines. Smh actually read super interesting article similar H1N1 pandemic occurred 1880s(?) believe first pandemic gave ""older"" generation Spanish flu immunity Spanish flu, likely survive it. wait, 40 years could get deadly Covid-59! First step towards socialism. /s Yep, already threatened multiple times here. Going 30 years old going back live parents separated fiance can't afford stupid rent getting behind sick! That‚Äôs US-centric way thinking.

It's US-centric way thinking I'm American live Americas?

Good luck that. thats herd immunity virus even thing. Thats big gamble, especially surfacing reports reinfection Hope roadside assistance. AAA work... Unless drinking problem... might need AA.
 
Of course, always C way fixing problem. then? Mandatory quarantine? I‚Äôve seen lot people misunderstand test one point reference time testing incubation period may detect infection. want federal funding dip grubby fingers it? Edit: back school I‚Äôd take photos let principal know suspend contact nice lawyer get fat settlement. Many vaccines small percentage population can't take them, due condition interact well vaccines. people depend rest society vaccinated, avoid getting disease them. 

Also simple issue vaccine deniers taking hospital beds resources. :O mask? Gel! pants? Gelll..! 47 yo doesnt know behave? Gel! hit people? Immediately gel. amount wrongful death lawsuits towards schools

Hey worry! Leader McConnell promised protect them. least within California, Berkeley almost online, UCLA 92% classes online, across CSU campuses (ok, maybe top-tier) 90%of classes online. concerned people coughing food cook it.

Also, easier wash orange soap thoroughly? so...when time break hardcore hazmat prepper gear? current scientific consensus, fwiw, risk prolonged sun exposure weigh risks. Coronavirus likes this. miss trump babbling 5 months ago?? miss ""the hoax"" part? obviously intentional, like San Quentin. stop make stop. West coast fla here. Lots state tags...mostly New York, Michigan, Ohio. Miami seeing lot Alabama, Georgia, etc plates. It‚Äôs mess here‚Äîbut tourists still coming droves. Imagine fearing HIV time. it‚Äôs terrifying that‚Äôs position What? That's generally happens stop job hired do. Unless I'm missing saying. That‚Äôs good Fauci say that. People getting little carried away temperature checks brings false sense security. mean. 9/11 different coronavirus.  emergency response. Everything theatre nowadays embarrassing Look guy's post history user name. Aye knew someone said me, well done friend, today know Godwin's law unfortunately.

Edit: rather relative (in experience) I‚Äôm taking vaccine principle. believe vaccines offer outstanding benefits outweigh possible risks. However Covid-19 vaccine suspect moving fast won‚Äôt level confidence it‚Äôs effectiveness side effects vaccines normal public health climates. valetudinarian case may be! US want break new Covid world records? Republican establishment growing amount blood hands. Hope burn hell.  Anything pretend Trump braindead gibbon sitting oval office. Alabama tremendous number uneducated white people support Trump Republican Party.

They don‚Äôt trust science. lies lies misinformation guy. words. That‚Äôs US-centric way thinking. Many people central South America consider ‚ÄúAmericans‚Äù far live continent America name.  

Not sure say ‚ÄúSouth America‚Äù part America. That‚Äôs like saying South Los Angeles considered part Los Angeles. literally said exact word read headline. Glad I‚Äôm alone. I‚Äôm giving country 3-5 years grow fuck even I‚Äôll probably still leave. Fuck assholes. Thank this. Unfortunately scare mongering coming media sub absolutely mind blowing. TBF, also get things done normally get blocked good reason fact people pay attention whenever start negotiations start high end somewhere middle (sometimes half reason add stuff cut later ""compromise""). Plus, let's honest, reason Senate executive want sign bill nothing tag along bills everything price tag, said much publicly argued (a) want $600 week unemployment benefit continue (they accept something smaller), (b) parties want supplement additional state spending (Trump's words here, paraphrased, states lots money, demonstrably false moment). Democrats made moves compromise dropping certain provisions price tag Republican leadership publicly stated enough willing walk away took public measures executive action make nice sound bites actually much.

Instead playing hardball, rolling back everything did, suing shit every criminal GOP operative throwing jail, instead emphasize importance turning cheek, taking high road, rising messiness, moving forward...they extend olive branch, welcome colleagues open arms, ask collaborate find ways compromise...

They squander majority, piddle away time, punish one, choose focus ""social"" issues like transgender rights something else equally tone deaf touch reality peoples' suffering.

I routinely read /r/COVID19 studies spread happened why. find reports fascinating.

This article resonates based upon I've read: try pay attention high risk activities, simple, effective things correctly.

First, go places need to.
Second, wear mask.
Third, time friend. Let things sit bit. Let packages, mail, groceries, etc sit someone last touched. Slowly stroll next space line grocery store, hurry occupy space person in. Even couple minutes second, something distance last interaction space / area / object bit.

The things watch for:
Places people stationary long time, might also stationary long time.
Cooler areas
Indoor generally

A couple modeling reports spread-reports showed highest risk locations infected individual sits one place saturates immediate area downstream. They've found infected people move (like shopping store) leave enough virus behind wake likely infect someone. sit chat store, things get bit dicier.

So, keep moving. Like Brad Pitt World War Z -- keep moving, stay places people moving.

Outdoors generally safe. Stay 6' away, there's good airflow, sun, etc. something worried unless there's obviously someone coughing everywhere. I'm worried everyone masked outside interacting, chill some. try stand bit askew I'm directly line-of-talking.

More notably, crazy wash hands worry surfaces. mask futz much with, virus hands, oh well, like I'm sucking thumb. routinely rub hands jeans pants something else touching stuff since virus fairly fragile surfaces, bit rough wipe natural oils hands plus touching face good enough. small habit try adopt.

Stuff like groceries, mail, etc. usual lazy thing deal things later. perishables, again, try deliberate I'm stirring air, wipe/wash hands afterwards. like sniff bags, long hands touch face, I'm cool.

For masks, end tight situation couple zen things.

First, never breathe deep. Small, shallow breaths help focus sucking air far away, protective.

Also, breathe nose reason.

Third, may seem silly, may help lot. I""m writing this, lol. this: *hum*.

In 2013, Congress passed Full Faith Credit Act prevents congressional salaries among prioritized items, national debt reach statutory limits. 

In 1992, Congress ammended Constitution legislated pay increases could go affect next election cycle (giving citizens opportunity punish representatives increase deemed unearned.)

In 1991, Senate voted limit earned outside income 15% salary. (No idea one's still books)

In 1989, changed scheduled CoL's tied General Schedule federal employee salaries, elements Employment Cost Index, ensuring raises dependent general health actual economy. 

And notably, 

In 1999, Congress voted reduce planned 3.4% increase pay .97% vetoed President. (HR 3064)

So answer question, **Yes.** Congress has, least one occasion, unsuccessful attempting give lower salary one scheduled receive.

It's somewhat vogue make fun Congress setting salaries, know expect. Congress power purse. Saying Congress determine ought paid like saying right determine spend money. literally Congress's job, determining right way allocating personal emolument discharging public responsibilities *is* self government looks like, small business owner way Congress.

2. infection became widespread people actually socially distance mask up. Clearly everyone, even majority, appears enough slow spread.
3. possible infection can't find new hosts - everyone already it, already naturally immune, still taking preventative measures.

This good news. also means likely second wave people taking precautions ease restrictions. School openings likely going cause next spike. Yeah deal cleanliness issues, disease much likely. even remember quickly, talk guy cut baby grateful baby! Hey, said Palpatine could get things done. mean getting good things done....

There's legacy racism, yes. vitamin deficiency (which strikes dark skinned people much frequently body uses sunlight manufacture it), obesity, prediabetes together represent high-prevalence risk factors black people could start changing own, right now, even can't go doctor. 

You can't even find ""vitamin D"" mentioned articles/papers. Virtue signaling much love black people (and hate oppressors) literally coming expense actually sharing information could actually help black people save lives. 

It *doesn't matter* whether ""structural racism"" reason black people higher rates obesity; thing is, could start change that, right now. could pick bottle vitamin way home couple bucks. 

But guess that's sexy enough message. Hell, I'm probably secret T***p supporter breaking pom-poms joining in! Clearly, there's possible reason bring actual, direct, medical bases explains black people average vulnerable virus (along ways could address vulnerabilities themselves.) Depends comes from, developed it, says safe.

Russian version touted Trump? FUCK. NO. only, alas technology yet. Need allot enough time make arduous horse buggy journey back wilderness, too. u wear mask prevent 9/11, I'm pretty sure ppl *Andrew Dice Clay noises* fuck. even get recess like this? Fucking bullshit Sure...sure will...

This America. 

Raping people health care here. rest us plebeians luxury paid time sarcasm? Sorry hear fragile ego. hope learn happy yourself. March, Senate sat rather picking even debating it, despite Dems' saying negotiate Democrats pass $3 trillion coronavirus relief bill despite Trump‚Äôs veto threat

So that's talking new stimulus bill. overall, there's Democrats passed nearly 400 bills. Trump Republicans ignoring them. first succeed infecting enough people. Try, try till infect rest. Face masks, social distancing infection control rule. They're guide line really. extremely loose vague guide line. ""yeah mean end November Democraps win"" - half people Facebook feed Ok Except vaccine approved end year quite likely. Returning normal take several months afterwards due task vaccinating many people. think clarify think mainstream media corporations. media general, including social media. internet made easy insulate points views like finding others share own. Whether Fox News, blogs, Youtube, Reddit, Facebook, people naturally sorting tribes, tribes radicalizing want entertained want informed. Blame that, corporations fulfill desire.

That's fair. see chicken egg thing. see might partially caused human nature, media facilitator. Yup, we've known since February dont control thing flu season screwed. Thanks Trump! Hopefully COVID goes like season 8, totally unenjoyable shitshow instantly forgotten soon it‚Äôs over. garbage getting posted?

Because people twitter call general strike ""Americans call general strike"" headline? Seriously, mods need take fucking trash down. fuck even source? heaven's sake, clicked link literally 5 twitter users source! Almost people infectious would tested negative 2 weeks ago.

A 2 week old positive result implies patient likely longer contagious expected immunity second infection.

Edit: 2 week old results useless epidemic control. would actually safer let old positives return campus old negatives, positives less likely contagious now.

Edit 2: difficulty wrapping head around this, might familiar facts viral kinetics outlined reply, below.

Edit 3: thought goes without saying, people symptoms allowed return campus. comments old positive test results refer people symptoms (see CDC guidelines, below).

Edit 4: Inserted first line, try make easier everybody understand. I‚Äôve spread misinformation. posted links two suspected re-emergences, paraphrased Fauci‚Äôs statements posted discussion vaccine development. I‚Äôm looking forward anyone‚Äôs vaccine it‚Äôs evaluated effectiveness see immediately kills test subjects. ""checking:"" 
Imagine short guy big buy fighting sticks. give short guy bigger stick. thats balacing scales. senate like giving small guy gun except trump actively sabotaging election. live failed state. Remove him? That's almost certainly true, grades 5-12 could certainly still remote ages 10+ able stay home alone without issue.

Then take K-4, split am/pm sections redistribute classrooms unoccupied 5-12 students.

You likely fewer 5-12 teachers since school remote assuming make video lectures, repurpose teachers k-4 students keep class sizes minimum.

Maybe even cancel kindergarten run 1-4. US, sheriffs actively threaten people *DO* wear mask. We've got serious issues rampant ignorant people damned proud stupidity. leave day completed work. leave done... come back. here! suspect first week March. hair falling like crazy. bad I'm chop 3 feet hair that's falling getting EVERYWHERE. sinks tub drains clogged it. get morning clean pile hair bed. getting pain ass. want cut beautiful long hair think I'm going :( That's part decision making. long term health damage well understood yet. mortality rate negligible. Passing onto family members also considered, especially based age group preconditions family members. Letting 50 year old Dad hold baby different letting 90 year old hold baby, statistically based covid deaths. Fearporn. stay fuck home. 200,00 already undercounting deaths know - 2 year old - dunno...some things don‚Äôt joke - like sending kid danger pandemic never change, Reddit Turns electing idiot president actually consequences. knew? get though? I‚Äôm 32 would like live life country I‚Äôm proud feel safe wife daughter in. 

I don‚Äôt want worry getting charged price new BMW 7 series hospital one us gets sick hurt especially Covid-19.

I don‚Äôt want live fear right wing dictatorship absolute stupidest scummiest Americans get run government.

I absolutely hate opinion Brenda Facebook thinks Covid-19 hoax viewed weight Dr. Fauci actual intelligent people. heard referred omni-crisis. need GAW DAM civil war!!! Lol stfu Yeah. smoking pandemic orders magnitude worse COVID. Thank service yes, It‚Äôs disheartening. Sweden? prolonged lockdown w/o outdoor exercise = obesity = deaths. 

A balance always found. Personally think normal Mon-Fri Sat-Sun lockdown would good compromise. thats actually true, means herd immunity works 3 months. bills? summer heat doesn‚Äôt anything really kill COVID like people thought would, get people outdoors, alot safer open air. However, starts getting colder outside people start going back indoors, COVID start spreading alot faster people aren‚Äôt practicing social distancing hanging indoors together.

Plus, normal flu season start kicking gear we‚Äôll global pandemic still raging top that. üôÑ also wonder decided ""you know make money on/pile debt onto? people getting education make country better!"" likely turn seasonal thing like flu get working vaccine. tremendous drop death rate, things looking much better  found 29 people infected far, many likely appear. none showed symptoms 31 July. index case remains first infected showed symptoms day work sick 9 days testing positive. people hospital far doctor, saw 5 August referred get Covid test (which 6 days) co-worker wife's. 

And circulating, point article. could come frozen freight. Local hospitals allocated 3 rapid tests day. He's fun-gi asshole.

&amp;#x200B;

Also add 3 items(demands) article, MUST MEDICARE PART SOLUTION Influerona French 1789? That's non statement, america ""go for"" herd immunity yet 170k deaths. Bring something scientific board would hard. Hopefully areas affected lockdown, would ruin economy. wanna die. small reason? Fuck shit, get paid vacation, millions suffering, thousands lost business, millions job closed job new schdeule less hours...fuck them, burn thid shit down, deserve fuckin tax money...let's give money doctors essential workers scientists doin research shit...fuck government put back all.

The vaccine plan always involved end year approved vaccine. 2021 would ramp up. 2022 2023 every responsible person getting booster shots annual biennial basis.

Fauci also seems like he's scientifically responsible promising anything can't deliver. 50% effective vaccine end 2021 worst-case. I'm sure thinks 80%+ effective vaccine pretty widely distributed summer-2021. please, stop spreading misinformation, effect much worse think. nationalize nursing unions? think right national group states like NY arent. AMA supposed act like physicians' union divided, docs pay attention specific speciality like ACC ATS ACOG. fair healthcare workers need band together sue shit federal government. Michael. :( live area taking seriously low cases result, tyvm. I'd say live life mostly normal, obvious exceptions masks, table distances/caution restaurants (on rare occasion eat in), schools remote primarily telework. 

It big country shitton people everywhere same. one case fits all. things left state/city needed. Unfortunately places fucking hard, everywhere. said wasted 20s. assumed turn 30 next year blaming wasted decade covid.

Ah saw edit. Makes sense Lol Enjoy country's descent fascism, fucking boot-licker. Go cry daddy, authoritarian piece shit. Yep. said something almost verbatim last sentence around March 15th. problem president cohorts cannot solve, base lack critical thinking capacity solve. happens get people told believing propaganda critical thinking.

Auckland, NZ, found 4 cases community transmission breaking 100 day streak community transmission, shut schools region. that, another 25 reported linking previous 4. goes show even small number cases literally shoot immediate action best better long term results. Damn, Tennessee really want entire place infected? agree, better safe sorry case. know someone tested negative twice March, couple days ended hospitalized spent month respirator. another ""You look United States America, epidemic obesity were. number people hypertension. number people diabetes. everyone got infected, death toll would enormous totally unacceptable,"" Fauci said.

Fauci calling it. Fat America really asking trouble. I'm getting ads Target exact opposite. They're promoting sales home schooling.

Personally, would much, much rather get paid half much actually safety net guaranteed holidays, vacation, sick leave, sensible insurance. *9* false positives? Doubtful.

How hard understand this? like 12 damn stupid? U.S. start per se, certainly war would global control. People love wear ""U.S. good guys"" WWII blinders ignore 70 years imperialist wars conquest after. 50,000 cases per day
Let's conservative say 5x actually getting infected, that's
250,000 cases per day

Or

45 million 6 months conservative number holds. 

Considering 7% population already infected (per latest Osterholm podcast) that's:

7% 330 million = 23 million 

23 million existing infections 
+
45 million new infections 6 months

= 68 million infections total, 6 months, 20% US Population.

Is correct?



If infections 10x testing for, that's 500,000 infections day, 90 million next 6 months. Add 23 existing infections got 113 million infections end 6 months, roughly 1/3 population. 

I see rate would slow things little, much 30% completely unknown.

Epidemiologists infectious disease specialists top (Fauci Osterholm) said would slow significantly 70% population infected, that's considered herd immunity. 

The bad news 1% CFR, 50,000 confirmed cases per day would give us 90,000 additional deaths 6 months. 

Maybe CFR changed, true CFR places test lot closer 0.5% without enough testing enormous population, surprised 1% CFR, missing lot cases. 90,000 deaths next 6 months actually sounds right, given we've lost 155,000 (probably higher) last 6, treatments improved.

Looks like US trying herd immunity. vaccine can't come soon enough! Thank you! little late, ya think Yes weak people die. Yes herd immunity real. argument based science. Come back is. athletes started 4 weeks That's immunity all. mention value masks, ventilation HEPA air purifiers classrooms. Seems like egregious oversight. locked March April, spent three trillion dollars, get virus point could managed masks wearing, testing contact tracing.

Right around mid April said fuck it, let‚Äôs open everything anyway. we‚Äôll 175,000 dead Labor Day, 300,000 dead end year, kinds fuckery economy, entire year lives lost. 2021 we‚Äôll additional 20,000-30,000 dead every month vaccine available. I'm seeing ""I know believe!"" posts lately. I'm going optimistic assume reality seeping cracks people primarily get news from, certain TV channel certain website.

For us following reliable sources beginning, disaster far predictable. Netherlands isnt better Germany Belgium atm litterally hardest hit country world, even tho think Peru pass them. better isnt hard magic get pick one happen:

 * Trump loses election 200k americans die covid-19
 * Trump wins election million americans die covid-19

The magic powerful enough ensure exactly many americans die covid-19. mean seems like attacks blood vessels could least damage penis clitoris... made sure expose 14 minutes time, covid gets 15 minutes. right. 10% infected appear suffer long term effects.

This simply problem poverty. discussing politics Covid thread? One politicizing Covid less? make sense. learn science bro believe they're open either. people buying many things online, may need re-open malls anyway. COVID-19 accelerated trend running direction prior. say lagging indicator. almost need jobs economy. affects old sickly especially deaths good trade off. paying attention see would level optimism. actively openly (even said openly) working suppress votes obstruct electoral process. that, plus tangential stuff, like smaller class sizes (which know better learning), etc., etc., etc.

Like... surprise, find reopening schools half capacity, running either two parallel cohorts in-person remote learning two rotating cohorts in-person learning, likely greater impact controlling virus spread direct measures mitigate transmission risk. is, reducing number density contacts produces larger effect diminishing transmission rate per careful wish for, anti-lockdown protesters yelling needing haircuts. also love ""We following protocols invented we've got control"" theatre. produced ventilators people even use, wrong type ventilators, additional ppe testing equipment lmao. entire administration corrupt cesspool since inception Well completely isolated? cold store another country months¬π1 Base Camp Plus mask. n99 carbon filters messing valves swapping filters think stack properly sized plastic washers would enough lock valves.

What's surprising everyone starts one side, matter side right wrong, exactly one party flip sides. I‚Äôm confused. group people believe Fauci says it? 
It‚Äôs known LONG time temperature checks reliable. news? health authority requested church members refrain singing wear mask even sing.

The choir said wore masks singing . That's point genius.

Right, second get admitted hospital confronted it.  assholes typically post here. ...and fear. absolutely refuse consider something causes fear. won‚Äôt.

Okay... rush conclusions (because article suggests ""Auch aus anderen Studien ist bekannt, dass bei einem Teil der Personen, die nachweislich mit dem SARS-CoV-2-Virus infiziert waren, nach einer gewissen Zeit keine Antik√∂rper mehr nachgewiesen werden k√∂nnen. Dies bedeutet jedoch nicht zwangsl√§ufig, dass keine Immunit√§t besteht."" 

It tells story already know *(sorry, can't translate word word)*: people lose antibodies time passed - results basically line studies. Additionally statement: *This necessarily mean immunity.*

Conclusion: could've antibodies. can't say never antibodies all. Stupid journalists. exactly, long article airborne spread need ventilation. cool feature lets calculate risks indoor exposure. Oh specify, anything eaten raw open store like fruits veggies getting washed too, kind assumed given lol There‚Äôs vaccine common cold doesn‚Äôt kill people often, SARS contained. funding = vaccine legitementally think could throw EVERYONE charge U.S put 30 youth government high schoolers charge whole shit things would go better. soon decide want us sue them. hold breath. ‚ÄúAll put kids building lock it!

The New Zealand-model commendable. rest world must learn it. principles (border-control measures, community-transmission control measures, case-based control measures) applied many places similar positive results. require right political adhere public health advice respond accordingly measures strict implementation. Similar models used Hong Kong Australia, however allowing exceptions created different results.

I confidence New Zealand get back zero cases. 

This article getting thrashed came day new cases:

 

But everyone saying ""see told so, can't contain it"" wrong (again) willfully ignoring strain may originated frozen freight strain border.

And exactly New Zealand zero cases long celebration everyone hungers scientific knowledge virus - little virus running around means greater ability pinpoint behaviour. 

The message New Zealand's measures effective, dependable, shown results, adhered strictly. long term gain worth short term pain eloquently put it. Im gonna see feels block exhaust vents mask have. pretty easy since simple silicone disk locating hole it. Probably could use plastic washers hold valve closed There‚Äôs vaccine common cold doesn‚Äôt kill people often, SARS contained. money profit = vaccine think measurements, aka recommendations given Swedish authorities Swedish citizens, fairly well educated trained listen authorities think ourselves, going work best Sweden.

Others copy would probably get results redittor pointed out, universal health care social contract society services running ways, citizen society authorities. could work countries also element aware of, culture physical distancing begin with.

I hope work countries like means set lot checks balances follow physical distances distancing stores, bars, restaurants (just table service) limits social gatherings limits sports gatherings well social distanced gatherings concerts pens possible work home. stay home sick, even bit sniffles. wash hands often sanitize surfaces often well.

And travel transport companies adapt services probably doubled rush hours help physical distanced transportation. many people biked walked work spring summer months. like change autumn winter months looming ahead. transport companies adapt likely continue ask bus passengers go board backdoors ask passengers wear mask crowded without masks. 

And probably later autumn wear masks well. good portion people already people take knowledge virus spread starting wear mask staying home sick. recommendation yet mask-wearing. 

It vital stay home sick, even little sniffle bit unease throat something. scale population. Sicknesses fizzle out. past flu-season, last part new years, came whent fanfare - fizzled way less.

This opinion best guess works Sweden working bit.

Yet virus gets 24/7 coverage people trying dismiss coronavirus bringing child abuse/human trafficking?

How news networks dedicate 1/10th coverage missing exploited children talk. needed something incentivize people go back work. It‚Äôs common sense.

the jobs aren‚Äôt man. millions businesses closed, they‚Äôre opening soon.
edit- also, $600 week isn‚Äôt ridiculous. made barista, get $300 every 2 weeks disagree factual correctness statement disagree meaningfulness. approach still better public health 99% people. I'd hazard guess chance somehow get enough virions body get sick, inhale enough virions someone else make sick much less chance happening cloth mask, cloth mask filter anywhere near 100% particles either direction, especially considering leakage.

So I'm betting cloth mask, decrease probability infection another person given I'm sick offset increase probability get sick. Especially live someone else, get sick, that's 2 infections don't.

Either way, please refrain going others like me, IMO taking responsible option. leave house perhaps twice week necessary stuff, work home, always wear respirator public housemate (my mom) also wears one goes week. Let's worry people going every day, stopgap cloth mask, slipping talk coworkers, heading bars restaurants like 2019. much favor this.  Good thing Trump signed executive orders past weekend then! least something! Pelosi buddies definitely ""for people"".

Get f**king flu shot. comorbidities really think N95 might make difference. positive COVIDs see often report losing sense smell. patients transferred hospital mostly smokers.

Oh, also meant say, I‚Äôm aware need around 70% infected population herd immunity, factor 10 based testing numbers. I‚Äôm trying say bet every 1 positive test, 10 people didn‚Äôt want get tested didn‚Äôt. tests take week get back, aren‚Äôt helpful. think dozen reasons people would scared go get tested. wanna stay bed recover.  don‚Äôt think 1-to-10 ratio unrealistic. it‚Äôs close ratio, close herd immunity, even numbers. understand that‚Äôs big IF, it‚Äôs interesting think about. Oh hahah hahah hahah Apparently told instructed social distance use masks... mostly police gone didn‚Äôt follow precautions. There‚Äôs also anti covid people causing doubt confusion. Ya I‚Äôve exercising quite bit. Probably best idea honest.

That‚Äôs exactly guy was. you‚Äôre trash humans thinking like that. late? And, money pay taxes wasn‚Äôt protect us! military doesn‚Äôt plan pandemic?!

We largest best military world. failure pandemic plan. Pretty much like security theatre tsa is. bread circuses way down, baby... know NYC subway buses signs ""Assaulting transit employee felony punishable 7 years jail"". isnt anything new covid think definately need something like protect airline workers, hell even essential employees well. Russia, general, fantastic vaccine-producing industry. I'd take Russian vaccine day. is, hastily produced. that's definitely going case. superior scientific practices. Japan made vaccine, could definitely regard near perfect. It‚Äôs almost like rich powerful made vanish it‚Äôs inconvenient ends. son whose worn valved masks last year half told cover going hospital back March. go anywhere specific guidelines (hospital, nursing facility, etc) rigging something inside probably won‚Äôt help. can‚Äôt imagine checkin nurse would anything make cover move along. Goodluck Arizona kids! Covid heatstroke interesting combination seen three different people know Mexico last week? Honestly policy fairly ineffective still fly resorts fully open. almost nothing ever going change unless stand people something.

Elections going take us far nothing resolve issues occurring elections. It‚Äôs south, suburban Wisconsin filled people refusing. wear masks social distance. It‚Äôs infuriating. happens get arrested eventually released random city hundreds miles live? can't fly home. bus back? come back arraignment whatnot?

I'm guessing (deservedly) screwed this. Thanks, helps. 35 enough raising stakes... living car I'd damn sure vote whoever put although death rate includes ages know mostly concentrated people certain age. cases declining shouldn‚Äôt therefore also see decline demand tests?

If tests declining actual decline cases, would expect percentage tests coming back positive would also decline, we‚Äôve seen many areas gotten outbreaks control. 20% tests come back positive like they‚Äôre seeing Texas much sign things control. needs talked much more. Especially young people end sick extended periods time. hope therapies develop people dealing this. would say here? Lol.

People protesting school open knowing full well bunch kids got covid. dense motherfuckers really tho? Well, need keep election safe democracy. Gotta make sure priorities straight times like these, otherwise might lose job.  know cases 10 25 times official cases. Let's assume 15 times official cases. take case Brazil estimate almost 50 Million people infected. There's almost 106000 deaths. Granted lot people currently infected might add total deaths end even death rate around 0.2%. 1% gross overestimate actual IFR. end speculation keep getting told infection rate LEAST 10 times recorded cases. math country taking variable account death rate well 1%. Even Belgium arguably one countries deaths per 1 million 1%. accurate take, probably Americans around culture much. generally reduce ""Liking flag makes racist"" (Though two often correlated :p). average Southerner feels like beliefs constantly attack parts country much louder cultural voice, like California New York. 
They like told gay ok prayer welcome school generally religious upbringings hammered God says things way. them, flag represent race, represents South standing overbearing North.

They're incredibly wrong course. Confederacy fought preserve slavery doesnt deserve venerated way, shape, form. That's think it, though. incredibly difficult convince otherwise too, I've tried many times :p I'm right behind line. Yea totally agree. likely bypass temperature screens taking Advil/Tylenol going through. Plus mentioned poster asymptomatic people called asymptomatic reason, fevers believe joke. Whether good one another issue. sure dumb joke dumb... wipe good required contact time :p pisses beyond belief!!!!

Right. nobody even opening windows five minutes classes, attempting adjust class length, or... anything. act like wiping desks staying room day going protect everyone not. ...of covid-19 only. yet, look peak deaths overall, peaked 18.7-26.7 average deaths time year. US average 36-41 percent. administrators, teachers, parents, politicians. Everyone's going along it. like people stupid.

FTFY ‚ÄúHaxtun Holyoke bridged social distance Eastern Plains, raising nearly $120,000 help 29 Phillips County businesses need Colorado‚Äôs COVID-19 shutdown.‚Äù get tested schedule? point say fine, there‚Äôs point trying stop covid, let everyone get stop containment measures? next week three times that... Ok party over, go home cant stay here. 
""Dumb"" describe what's going here. naive people able tested months ago rich, famous, politicians, zoo animals. can't wrap head around this; would many people refuse vaccine? bogus anti-vax propaganda really affected half country? people scared particular vaccine might negative side effects show years? seems like everyone becoming less rational less capable intelligent thought day now. 60-80%, talking death toll 4-7million range. Think 30-40x Idiots incompetence makes national news daily. grounded reality. guess that's human nature. Even TX things pretty serious people dgaf. Rushing towards herd immunity one high school time. okay Mr.Wholesome, it‚Äôs question speech. countries lost respect US. messed up. school trying bend backwards avoid teachers taking another teacher's classes. course, means lots us teaching virtually physically time wow. people offered extra pay help monitor students morning 4 temperature mask check points manned administration. That... actually terrible idea. accused Chi-nuh fixing numbers, without providing evidence, based projection themselves. You, well! know help not; doing. beginning started putting trash bags kitchen floor (not large enough counters everything)and clean side dirty side. groceries went dirty plastic. Got washed w/ soap water. moved clean. put up.
 
After understanding transmission etc started ""dirty"" drawer refrigerator. prop fridge open, unload trunk drawer. Leave 3 days. Anything non refrigerated item goes box. Finally, needs frozen wash adding freezer. idea long virus could stay frozen.
 
Anyway, really cut ton time stress me. Feel free disregard you. Best luck stay well. That's socially distance pandemic. risk exposure something could kill maim you. Plus worrying stuff like 14 days pure isolation, etc...

Its easy choice. can't say exactly common nasal cannula therapy was, according used bubbling oxygen last ditch effort people death's door, lot people died due secondary bacterial infections caused weakening lungs virus. Hard say many hospital covid, would venture greater 10 times number died. hospital extra ICU full two floors full covid patients, we're small community hospital.  virus spreads *extremely* rapidly mitigation measures taken. think necessary started much sooner fit current estimates. Frankly, need push governments cross bridge get prepare next pandemic. 

Fortunately mine (Canada) is. I'm familiar work 1) Encourage domestic manufacturers make PPEs, 2) Develop emergency logistics plan kicked next pandemic. lead author said done study, proof committed academic fraud accuse understand epidemiology.

smh

This might one dunning krugeresque posts ever read.

I read response, feel free make one.

We infinite supply medicine respirators, pandemic becomes bad enough demand technology outstrip supply inherent deadliness come fore. Well yeah obviously. change fact Republicans always choose identity politics science, pandemics damned. Anthony, that's problem see. **didn't** pull together 9/11. sides used drive deep poisonous wedges American society doubtful recover.

Sucks, know. Identity politics fucking horrible. didn't. basically saying ""ackshually whole human race could destroyed meteor tomorrow, see happening"". I'm pointing making useful observation. Unless literally everything know epidemiology human immune system wrong, vaccines, today, wrong. ""*technically*"" correct entirety human knowledge immunology could undergo Copernican revolution next months. fucking doubt it. worried meteor tbh. drama increases paycheck usually.   rioting / civil unrest. say we're headed another civil war. didn‚Äôt realize much needs physical contact pandemic started. miss face face interaction. I'm mobile can't link papers, figure 100% chance infection? Household attack rate even close that... it‚Äôs guaranteed three months, he‚Äôs saying it‚Äôs least three months say smart, wear mask, wash hands. long term social distancing definitely significant negative effects ones mental physical health. gyms = harder stay shape, alcohol use increasing, isolation leading anxiety/depression. mention economic loss- bartenders service industry workers losing livelihood. yeah, I‚Äôd say certain point people, it‚Äôs calculated decision they‚Äôd rather risk getting virus. made decision cease social distancing early May, got Covid late June, recovered. I‚Äôm low risk. I‚Äôm saying is, it‚Äôs personal decision government shouldn‚Äôt making us. went strip club last week. Got lap dance wore mask lol. feel good supporting economy tho. still believe March we‚Äôll distributed enough behind us especially considering hundreds millions doses start 2021 Low effort trolling. 1/10. me, social life peoole there. Society isn‚Äôt going change 0.26% death rate virus. won‚Äôt, hate want. Im currently packed bar thats flouting rules we‚Äôre young gonna waste youth worrying grandma. Muh first amendment freedumbs given 5 dollar coupon target got vaccine America. definitely get free know look I'd still rather theater absolutely nothing, though... it‚Äôs consolation, multiple vaccine candidates experts like Fauci high confidence exact time timeline (Moderna, Pfizer, Oxford). Anybody says know country look next July lying, think it‚Äôs possible things much better shape then. Best luck Good im ready. vaccine actually finished. still going phase 3 testing. Putin said done everyone believed him. Ended big win him. would organized religion yeah, ""Rights, blahblah rights"" way grave. Thoughts &amp; prayers around.  Stop beatin' dead horse, ya? Turns can't train many doctors specialist nurses 7 months.    South Korea couple dozen cases per day worse, like months. NY still hundreds daily cases. Big difference. faintest clue fuck speak living reddit bubble echo chamber. people experience aware dual infections. illnesses put home prevents exposed viruses. makes sense multiple infections, seen often forget it. Though see bar sales liquor store sales up. Maybe people drinking smaller groups -- outside, even. bikes. (But riding them!) UNC also telling anyone many cases FERPA.....Their President said would FERPA violation would little cases sick student could easily identified. also telling students buildings floors clusters on, students rightfully scared told nothing.

What embarrassment school second-best ranked School Public Health. hey seen stock market Thanks! Glad hear it. downvoted *because* accurate possible, able get people board. One prominent republican would get followers fall line like things actively hurt constituents still supported. Giving trying fix problem stupid too. realize Americans allowed developed countries going change can't get shit together. left behind rest world moves forward go shopping TJ Maxx go college football games. short sighted stupid.

Once upon time Americans set standard globally last years honestly tell rest globe looks disbelief. happened? guys ready give up? 

Almost everyone else able it. America? ... far. late. man high tower made political. Enough whinnying already. It‚Äôs complicated it‚Äôs sad companies ‚Äúenforce‚Äù policies people fucking stupid New York seems ok outdoor bars, seems places open indoor seated bars problem. cake Never trust Glados.

How Eddie Izzard?

[Eddie Izzard ""Cake Death"" Sketch Dress want us blaming other, fact matter is, Americans adopted masks better average compared countries without pre-existing mask culture. EVER win wars anymore?  fair, may due specifically virus. read article couple weeks ago lot people problem due anxieties quarantine, lockdown, uncertainty future, etc. Even boss, covid, styling hair differently colleague complimented it, confessed losing much days. (We video, btw, f2f.) bigger worry they'll start competing COVID patients tests. Right now, anybody flu like symptoms almost certainly COVID we're able find COVID patients without using bunch extra tests. testing system already strained start adding bunch flu patients need get tested, we're going miss lot mildly symptomatic COVID patients go spread COVID further. Surprised? thought agreed didn‚Äôt give shit stats. LOCKDOWN week ago. Hopefully city kept improving.  real lockdown. Everyone wants easy shortcut, one. nothing.  Keep mind social repercussions. Whether it, others know sure. *their* comfort, follow rules everyone else. that's enough reason, think possible ostracization following current social norms.

Also, know are, cost $$ access places ignore rules. already PTSD reasons pre-pandemic, pandemic really solidified feelings views lot things. definitely help regain trust confidence world. feeling impending doom turned pretty accurate Denmark Taiwan also success stories. FOXNEWS garbage. true virus attacking country. Exactly plus options without screens next none moment.

Virtual same. America, higher education choices shelling $50,000 year glorified YouTube playlist mingling dozens even hundreds potentially infected people one room another day long. Please draw conclusions without data. one would stay home MI, covid ot not. None conclusions drawn thread supported data either. data supports:

The graph shows admissions 2019 would classified MI classified COVID.  [This article morning shows health insurers doubled profits already know [Medicare provides additional money patients listed COVID-19 moment financial incentive list cases covid, insurers providers acted it. one turns extra money. I'm suggesting doctors changed treated patients anything like that. I'm simply saying data irreversibly contaminated. 

Let give example: asymptomatic patient gets heart attack, hospital patient undergoing treatment heart attack tested positive Covid, think going listed? would listed Covid patient. would treated heart attack like anyone else, data show Covid.

We literally idea extent severity disease is. Trump screwed up, CDC screwed up, Fauci screwed up. insurance companies screwed up. expected nothing less government bureaucracies programs, everyone advocating universal govt healthcare look situation case study would happen.

But come France Germany govt health care handle it. answer simple obvious - people work government countries incompetent. People countries interested healthcare (and education, many things) one place pursue career field-the government. get competent people.

In US, lots private companies, hospitals, etc work pay much much NIH CDC. best people go pharma private university-linked research hospitals (like Johns Hopkins, produce dataset analytics absolutely everyone including government relying on). best people go there, rest work government.

Socialized medicine works countries staffed run people countries. 

Our president literally idiot. think would appoint super geniuses run healthcare service?

Rely yourselves, take care families. America country, business. together, separately.  vacation near Eastern Maine/Canadian border. happened pass bridge early morning nobody around. 

And honestly wanted start sprinting across. verb describe sitting backwards chair toilet, sorry. sacrifice ‚Üí murder. I'm doctor whatever, took minute think realize, duh *of course* get two illnesses time. We're used getting sick one thing time.

So fault anyone minute brain fart - keep arguing incorrect assumption *then* there's problem. reason groups can't exist independently anymore society found useful rely other. think virus changes that. Fear mongering say every alum sexist xenophobe, although observation reflects poorly school, generalize. I'm sure intention dismissive think important protect communities condone sort behavior. kindly tell do, I'm allowed talk experience. need work bit harder achieving American dream, obviously. Can't fault government American dreaming enough.


/s obviously, case needed. German learned Oxford English school, first thought either. know?! Fear mongers. they‚Äôve school studied things extensively, maybe actual experience dealing identifying issues, doesn‚Äôt mean know us god fearing common sense folks! teachers, janitors, everyone else tested ? Sorry don‚Äôt want take vaccine won‚Äôt wear mask shit? thought great testing. Bigly.

Seriously even local clinic nurses don‚Äôt wear mask. ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt apply us‚Äù here. Maybe means ignore Coronavirus? crazy following public health guidelines made could something similar normal, without family friends dying? government maybe helped citizens go homeless hungry sick???and maybe people feel suicidal depressed , left wolves? would crazy. False negatives happen Oh good! googled time got right disease. I'm proud you. Mondays Tuesdays keep thinking Thursday.

On Thursdays think Wednesday Tuesday. 

Fridays fun since usually go work Saturday due understaffed. False negatives happen taken early illness there‚Äôs enough viral load. Yeah, today 35, lower average.

I still think current 7-day average near all-time high I'm glad got little relief! absolutely baffled way mind works, barely follow train thought.  pandemic doesnt end day vaccine made. Like said Im banking 2 years, could either direction dont think unreasonable based timespan past pandemics can't immediately find reference, believe someone hired NYT WaPo actually took 7 states worth data excess deaths able account 50% excess deaths beyond already counted COVID-19 findings Heart Attack Stroke.

Despite spending time home, people heart attack stroke years chronic health issues likely still them. one WANTS wear one. people think wearing masks like them? don't, anyway. reply wrong comment? Im referring small states equal say VS large states typed electronics device, I‚Äôm *almost* certain it

So makes think mean *science tyranny, doesn‚Äôt mesh well ideology / world outlook* perhaps? getting proper water pressure wash ones thinning hair. got bad feeling Fall.......  Ollie north pardoned, pretense already pretty thin. I‚Äôm fucking sick read endless garbage lobotomized pieces shit like *insist* inserting conversations us ACTUALLY give shit world trying have.

**If don‚Äôt want part society, don‚Äôt be**. 

Get fuck internet, pack shit up, go live fucking forest die minor infection spider bite shit.


Edit: ah course, old ‚ÄúI pretending retarded‚Äù backpedal. justification ppl requiring less makes sense. drink lot try get little activity help clear various biological systems. Ginger tea help inflammation don‚Äôt want take something else. Earlier month, said family getting death threats, revealing daughters need security fend harassment.

Smh, scumbags going man‚Äôs family well. Got it, we're goin fake news route. Wait, really think open hole lets breath unfiltered worse actually filtering breath?

Based what? also tragically predictable Someone get horse here!  We‚Äôre already making plans kids. think Halloween themed Easter egg hunt order. every person every protest neighborhood... forgot half ($300) $100 $400 supposed come states. bankrupt states, already paying unemployment checks old $600 went top of. need reach herd immunity protect immunocompromised empathy scarce resource days.  least, forfeit vote.   boomer dad kept telling ""100% sure would make deal. bargaining. "". says I'm cynical. think he's paying attention anymore. fuck careful *$300. states covering $100. won‚Äôt see months either way White House needs set whole system get us. imagine type human you‚Äôd let country  Sturgis thing. People return homes country. OC? Live. Laugh. Cough. Die.  happened China. thought they‚Äôd eliminated it, outbreak traced food imports. They‚Äôve testing imports ever since.

I don‚Äôt know countries took note started similar testing. It‚Äôs like COVID first broke Wuhan, yet countries made real preparations. It‚Äôs like data coming China isn‚Äôt taken seriously happens elsewhere. Perfect Peggy screaming people sit butts! idiots.


Every parent let pushed kid school idiot, everyone thinks opening schools global pandemic good idea equally stupid .


Weak willed idiots. country fucking joke. Again, far away election day? earth gonna help? Especially we've yet see impact school reopenings...

Also: Right California also seeing improvements (or ""improvements"") -- much sway think Trump's secret ninjas California officials? 

There seem burnout/plateau phenomenon virus (probably tied early superspreaders recovering dying off), understand dovetails falling testing rates % positives. Chancelor Valorum immediately removed power within moments non-Senator calling removal. would damn lucky Senate. need anything writing bills, vote American idle vote bill. reason representatives take weeks get California D.C. stood place, longer need that. Every Thursday vote electronically bills. still write course get vote, maybe make count deserve direct democracy. change point, like 80's now

The ones serving Congress since 70's Senators Patrick Leahy (D-Vermont), Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), Richard Shelby (R-Alabama) Representatives Young (R-Alaska) Jim Sensenbrenner (R-Wisconsin) Insider trading still basically legal. yes know stock act. didn‚Äôt work fucking inexcusable. fuck wrong government. assholes need wiped Yeah discount 60,000 extra deaths 20% would still get death count well 200,000. also evidence spike regarding Sturgis. Find anything says anything different. doesn‚Äôt mean fucking thing. 6 unarmed Black people killed police last year. Protests could killed tens thousands. black lives matter? ones killed police others infected disease partly spread protests? black officer protecting target black looters St. Louis? life matter? opinion whether protests important irrelevant. allowed march people allowed attend Sturgis. bad don‚Äôt see purpose good believe it‚Äôs purpose. It‚Äôs hypocritical. agree should‚Äôve done that, progressive unemployed democrat, Pelosi stubborn fuck. 
There ton money towards schools, food stamps, local state things could‚Äôve put hold now. yeah man think junst go flow sIdEs!! Damnnn Looting ATMs revolting. That‚Äôs theft. lie getting old. local representatives told face everything power confiscate guns force. Man, give advice sleeping schedule routines. hope. See headline September fun still inside. money :( literally couldnt afford trip there- let alone food strike. probably going much either weave isn‚Äôt tight enough. think idea they're suppose work state level stuff time. Even true, decide bigger fucking fish fry. jobs though. I‚Äôm sure using breaks pander major corporations relief give rich.  *that* would require getting heads assholes.  Take back money, take back power riots coming? really going wait november folks? Obama Joe Kamala promised us do? Nooooope. 
‚ÄúAn N95 respirator exhalation valve provide level protection wearer one valve. presence exhalation valve reduces exhalation resistance, makes easier breathe exhale. users feel respirator exhalation valve keeps face cooler reduces moisture build inside facepiece.

Protest action taken! Don‚Äôt let piss us obligations us!

Then, VOTE (and mail - Trump tainting option)! Explain Americans get guaranteed vacation yet get comfy pensions vacation? black lives matter highlights kinds ways country treats black lives like shit give fuck them, group overwhelmingly harmed shit like this. think solely police, one wants talk country fucks black folks yet another black person killed cops. love using CBD tinctures assumed going get taxed next year  dont understand situation absolutely nothing two party system. Huh, I've never seen cock measured volume before. work 190 days year, 7.5 hrs day, \~$1,000 hr, dont deserve month off, besides hot congress them, mean dont want getting heat stroke air conditioned chambers. 

we stop kind bullshit Republicans would never pass $3 trillion dollar bill several provisions fundamentally disagree Dems knew it. Democrats knew bill would never pass, passed political theater. pass non-bipartisan $3 trillion act expect pass. dead arrival. can't spot political plays like that, know tell you. 

Both sides ashamed this. Nah. military would wipe anyone attempting that. turn military maybe different story, could well happen. God help us. brag? actually pretty believable find 0.9 reasonable enough. Scary considering number may jump 20% certain demographics, line early estimates (before Covid got overpoliticized) American parents selfish entitled. They'd rather kill people what's right. We'll see. protests got pretty heavy, people looting fucking ATMs banks drive thru. I've never seen shit like that, bank hired security still hanging parking lot night lol problem presence wealthy senator Can't vote updated mailing address Yet somehow they're millionaires. [There evidence was, matter necessary thing ensure safety black people country. Ah yes. remember learning Antifa General George Washington school. Antifa continental congress.

All psychotic Antifa spouting bullshit liberty going rule law. guinea pigs right ‚îÄ Russia. Thanks, comrades.    
I'm wondering whether vaccinate people Phase 3 trial would vaccinate. We'll see.  isn‚Äôt even claiming N95 reviews clearly fake. Don‚Äôt buy mask. It‚Äôs ok folks still getting paid full cares right.... rich don‚Äôt give shit poor new news here. It‚Äôs poor waking more. afford it, going great time buy property very, cheap.

 


Government whole thing fails, money spent matter much. shit recovers, possibly got apartment complex cheap.

The one I've learned else 3 decades Americans forget easily hard time learning. live most? Maybe compared people born 1330 1920. 

The US falling apart put mildly. Authoritarianism rise around globe. There's pandemic caused disease affects older people, i.e. parents. Jobs lost, people homeless hungry already. rich getting richer. Wages keeping cost living everyone else. 

Also global warming threatening civilization know it. Americans even get month time every year corrupt core politicians going take month without even getting us penny. atleast separate pass 2nd round stimulus checks taking vacation? thought parties atleast agreed that.. I‚Äôd settle Senate doesn‚Äôt get paycheck unless legislation passes

But legislation always need passed. Surely job description includes voting no? New Zealand, dolt. used three year average baseline deaths might states baseline abnormally low. seems like five year average would accurate. Everyone keeps talking eating rich, much despicable get? anyone‚Äôs interested, there‚Äôs link another article link volunteer vaccine trials. Ive got depression ptsd, neither helped isolation pandemic outside door. sure get paid lot money job campaigned assured people capable obviously not. blood revolution. I've never really thought way. Maybe lizard virus mutate larger vicious dinosaurs time goes by. I've got think future children endure world ravaging scourge velociraptors running amok. Think I'll take reasonably priced level protection dinosaurs is. never know all. caveat direct democracy  maybe know something vaccine trying stretch Correct, I‚Äôm talking making prisoners, need jobs they‚Äôll fired, rest us. realize teachers trying make learning fun literally decades? simple pretending is, we'd solved education long ago. know kids complained learning physics playing Roller Coaster Tycoon.

Learning always worth doing. anything required practice work going fun own, unless actually want learn. ""I gotten Taco Bell today"" -Mitch McConnell Vote out, regardless party, purge system. Movement People's Party, DSA, several Leftist/progressive groups planning exactly that. July went congress critters/mayors/city council members homes demanded return DC support People's stimulus. believe they're planning new action soon. There's talk another visit home trying organize general strike.

More here: infrastructure ready remote teaching, I'm saying former teacher.

I advocate reopening schools US right now, remote teaching working well.

It every pupil full use pc school hours, desk work at, good internet connection. Given working hours comment, assume needs food, water, etc... would met?

Cuz i‚Äôm forcing leaders lead, uh health important it‚Äôs something mind due Covid right arent searching hard. go critique early handling pandemic trump administration. Pretty sure one people worked gave interview, even. think pandemic end reasonably soon. Wrong.

Not one expert says that. I'm talking Rush Limbaugh (wasn't supposed died 3 months ago... must Theft Freedom trinket wrapped around neck that's keeping alive; fraudulent theatrics, choose.)

They saying, all, December, infection rate doubled. Doubled.

And that's end. coming vax appears. Today via interview reported Bloomberg, heads 2 major, leading virus development teams, said expect solid info effectiveness respective vaxes 1 year now. Oxford, Pfizer.

So, conduct thinking re: education kids wearing reality hat.

Even Trump longer picture, virus going away; optics misrepresentation... call lies, Trump calls Rhetorical Hyperbole, ending all. Time break eggs eh? unfortunate result schooling becomes something rich get access. children poor lower middle classes end ones suffer strike, parents can't afford private tutors. America's Child Left Behind progressivism breaks classist, undeveloped third-world system ""education"".

The teachers make horrible choice letting happen else risking lives. terrible, doomed, atrocious system DeVos burn stake it! Zoom classes remote learning ALL, period, would've protected children teachers alike solved everything. Well, least I'll able tell Republican brother ""I told so.""   There‚Äôs nothing reasonable this. not. Buy gun buckle Ah see still won‚Äôt answer points nothing left say. Typical.  Presumably‚Äî we‚Äôre talking vocality Reddit right now. trying slight friend‚Äî get em big dog. remember shooting‚Äî shooting right direction. ü§úüèªü§õüèø schools already start USA? :o

I thought first day school usually 1st Sept using significantly higher heat bring meat desired temperature though? parts government taking seriously enough think people oppose leadership. people want open New Zealand. think behind transpired. statistics like gun store self surveys racial composition gun purchasers, know many NICS checks done. right, easily findable statistic. voting different knife. need stop stabber, give new knife. (The stabber wealthy already bought candidates, voting theater distract real problem.) mean ""banned mask mandates""? Well one party actively working American people least trying help helping themselves. average American voice Republicans. Democrats least reasoned brought around. Pretending parties lame attempt avoid facing actual issues. Intereesting Kinda hard parents buy presents kids lots people lost jobs can‚Äôt really afford buy gifts mortgages, bills, food, etc worry limited budget. That‚Äôs alluding to. literally getting ridiculous. Symptoms symptoms. Tests tests. Politics science. Everyone scared everything. trust friends family. Got it. stimulus isn‚Äôt taxable. IRS considers refundable tax credit taken either next year. considered income. ‚Äòhit‚Äô sustain taking year won‚Äôt able take next year. boot mid-flight: hello terminal velocity! fair, probably hot outside. think anyone ever able remove stick that's clearly wedged far ass, wish luck endeavor. nice day.

I'm sorry, know serious read Loudville, unorganized territory Maine got laugh. schools HVAC? Seems reasonable likely outcome. Hopefully fact got onto cluster fast means need go back strictest lockdown ""Can't live fear bro! Japanese plans real!"" well think even possible there's point conversation lol  course would be, call experts know true experts. plus seems like call experts cannot realize strain virus new humans. hey common sense always beat anyone degree. mean take look america common sense tells you, elected reality tv star fit reality tv country. bet would say could easily look up. state nebraska four months ago told state record numbers four months later finally put little bit there. numbers double triple posted.

Thanks! pandemic hoax. age groups, there's 99.9% survival rate, average age people die corona 80 years old, average life expectancy. that, amount deaths way over-reported. everyone ever tested positive corona died reported corona death, regardless corona actual cause. So, I'm reading correctly, even mild asymptomatic cases would conferred manner long-lasting protection even vaccine introduced, no? can't even comprehend number. No, see, need stay home. problem willing contagion. one dangerous society.

Especially state local govts actually provide services people daily. means apply logic them. I‚Äôm little confused, okay? (Honest question) Literally recess even thing time like this? unemployment $600 far less make, even work seasonal. 

Yet it‚Äôs far lot make. know local, national company hell time getting people work. friend owns small company said someone apply ask start August 1st. last time drove around town saw signs nearly every business saying hiring. 

The solution set percentage income, it‚Äôs ridiculous state‚Äôs unemployment systems shitty can‚Äôt accommodate that. insane mate kids go learn incompetence is. people New Zealand official capacities trying sabotage success?:""""Nevertheless, caution, we've advised staff isolate three days, showing symptoms get tested checked.""

$14k damage, I'm laying reddit stuff really jobs

They jobs. exactly Founding Fathers wanted US Federal system. wanted divided government, wanted slow progress, wanted decentralized process States local governments picked slack. 

You really need study US history better. Heck, look Russia Germany fell dictatorships quickly. Divided government prevents that.

Imagine AOC president (I know possible now), Pelosi controlled Congress, Senate 60 Democrats (or 51 got rid fillabuster). GND would passed. $10 trillion next 10 years. $4 trillion new Coronavirus spending. top $3 trillion already passed, plus trillions Fed buying up.

Holy shit, unimaginable situation. Thank God Senate nothing. Okay? Dont bail cities. gun face soon enough people left behind. Genius idea smooth brain, got more? ""The doctor said many nose bleeds kept finger there"" love cold hate heat.

Even touch anyone, evidence video alone I'd ban business. Awesome!üòÅ CBD edibles craziness anxiety would fucking roof. Canada looking pretty good right now. Senate work get paid. certain amount time, like two weeks, they're automatically recalled.

Right non functional federal government. developed country anymore. SICK 35, guys still parents? sounds nice... I‚Äôm assuming means states virus isn‚Äôt spreading uncontrollably It‚Äôs doubling concern already addressed , thus ‚Äúattacking straw man‚Äù.

Literally straw man argument dumb? 

No. That's general strikes work. Amazing. blood vessel virus. Athletes relying heart lungs might want take year away, cycle steroids, live isolated farm mountain. ‚ÄúWhile public health experts contacted story believe masks extremely effective means reducing transmission coronavirus indoors, Houston said it‚Äôs generally necessary wear outdoors.

‚ÄúAny virus massively diluted infinite space outdoor air dispersed air currents.‚Äù

Furness agrees, saying unless you‚Äôre dense crowd, need wear mask.‚Äù I‚Äôd risk heat stroke. Wtf.What kind message send ? (Senate going vacation) That's joke, need space sometimes. love 2 year old also look forward nap bed time. Oh right yeah definitely makes sense, thought saying winter temperatures northern hemisphere colder southern hemisphere, regardless habitation

E: realised guy replied still applies summertime busy 4th July hell. latter, main point people coming disrespectful - trash, graffiti, refusing wear masks. Further, middle global pandemic, people traveling.  hope means 100% normalcy like concerts amusement parks allowed. really hope get back semi normal, won‚Äôt scared going beach going friends house next spring least. exhausting able spend time people bf. thought asking really learn, would definitely happy engage discussion.

But can't waste time want argue point able shoot things say quippy rebuttal actually interested subject. Pharmacy administration rates like $19-$25 cash. get recombinant flu vaccine that's expensive even (as relatively expensive option) $42.

(Recombinant vaccines better H3N2 vaccines mutate infecting egg, cost reducing human immune response.)

You get flu shot $22 coupon pharmacy, lot pharmacies offer $5-$10 top bonus getting flu shot make profit 10+ prescriptions single shot even that, many workplaces US offer shot free benefit less sick leave employer exceeds costs administering shots. Worst fall we‚Äôve ever **yet**. Bruh 5 months ago predicting cessation human life December lmao Security theater, like TSA. know exaggerating, people could much million dollars. can't even count things could work resort north central USA, one us housekeepers staff wear masks, often even cleaning. guests entitled people I've seen.

Not masks social distancing - trash rooms, leave dirty dishes sink, grease stove, throw linen towels tub shower, leave sheets bed, utter mess. point being, entitlement mentality applies everything lives.

""Only matter everyone else fuck off."" 

And resort owners place fully open, care profits basic humanity. 

It's matter time get Corona here. God gonna really bad. poetry. deserve it. Good. hope ASAP. Fauci one sugarcoat, hope early 2021 vaccine cards. supposed get married next July. nervous! Yeah comment true since JFK got splattered. That's wrong untrue I

The Senate represented states,not people,in original intent. fairly recently senators doubted governors,not elected. Senate give choice shaker states interests considered large states . 

The problemisn't Senate,it's goose raise capped,thisthe branch dose supposed directly represent peeps screwed up,and relatively j less per electoral college.

Democracy great, meds safeguards ""majority role"" descend ""the tyranny majority.""every source power needs checked. power branch government, state governments, yes,even people. absolutely risk every person come contact with, alternative isnt necessarily healthy. Suicides depression significantly, everyone needs look life decide makes least risky decision themselves. 

Also, high level trust people pair with. us, ordered groceries worked home. saw day quarantine. going get sick community spread, would given prior lock down. least go run mask on? That's breath literally mask on. NM, large city containing virus well. leaves lots lots hospital beds in-state friends rural areas. Boy used them.

&amp;#x200B;

We're nice enough even keep small hospitals areas dealing pandemic surge empty possible overwork healthcare workers, would exacerbate situation. send big city, got space take care them.

It's honestly right thing do, I'm proud we've done enabled compassion we've able display. enabled controlling spread, good us.

I get rural person ago travelling within state. started giving grief us city boys pussies wearing masks. asked ship back 20+ patients area us pussies taking care big city hospitals back local hospital total 2 ICU beds. Shut pretty quick. Yeah man. Almost 8 billion people planet there's 760k deaths worldwide. new mortality rate around whopping 0.01% world population necessarily die COVID-19, system died. Let's also forget fact average age death US 79 years old, 3 fucking years older average life expectancy.

So yeah, means, keep hypochondriac. I‚Äôll vote person too, even means getting Corona quarantining away infant suffering alone. Joe go. Precisely. Americans officially living since 1776. don‚Äôt think socialist guy twitter article going garner entire nation? C‚Äômon! probably gather tens people cause! agree, requiring education measuring progress subjective evaluations, generally externalizing value education achievement always diminished efforts spread useful ideas.

Alfie Kohn great works subject, already pleasure.

If took words imply ""simple"" solution, I'm sorry. Coordinating curriculums, assembling syllabi, etc. tremendously complex work. Finding enough space others' attention even try entice game worth playing difficult environment slowly growing numb overstimulation. sounded like thought it, much less competition tradition, would ""easy"", that's bad.

But still think coordinated heist education possible and, presented appropriately, would bigger boon humanity would embarrassment current conceptions encounter today. know general strike needed. know right necessary thing. However went strike I'd immediately unemployed soon afterward homeless, child. got alot us balls.  Im low skilled labor, think could get another job reference? Unlikely. Without huge gap employment.  fucking sucks. health insurance, me, least it. Ive without health insurance life. problem live here. get get it. can't distance myself. I'm worried asymptomatic spreading. Im losing risk catching covid easily avoidable party every talk boils ""Well we're party. We'll fine"" head theres way say 100% unless everyone got tested something thats whats happening. seems easy party yet instead like ""*Shrug* happening"" 

Idk man generally losing lack social interaction. Sorry. way stop infection, would nuke orbit... easy look around country decide we've lost minds honestly, really 1/3 us. Unfortunately third noisy af. Flu shot free US almost every insurance. It‚Äôs preventative measure insurance companies know reduce amount spend long run. fairness, child die COVID, ceases problem. really, since (to best knowledge currently) catch illness once, quarantine per member household, unless large family, couple times (on assumption one person infected simultaneously).

Then, community reaches herd immunity everything great (so long ignore \~1% died, \~20% lasting complications, dramatic negative impact morale horrendous tragedy inflicts community - monsters promoting policies surely will). trust wikipedia though? policy isn‚Äôt inherently intentionally racist, appears discriminatory initial outbreak NZ mostly among wealthier white New Zealanders, weren‚Äôt forcefully isolated quarantined, whereas newer outbreak seems mostly among Maori/Pacific Islanders (perhaps introduced community via workplace exposure rather international travel... source tbd), despite smaller outbreak, forcefully removed homes quarantine. 

I think questioning rationale heightened level quarantine - feeling government views (Maori/Pacific peoples) less capable following self-quarantine rules white people brought virus country originally. Yes, white New Zealanders subject heightened quarantine rules going forward, fact NZ came realization self-quarantine isn‚Äôt effective bunch Pacific Islanders got disease makes seem like viewed less sophisticated, less responsible citizens less capable following rules white people. Considering much NZ improved coronavirus situation rules place, new policy, certainly effective, might seen overreaction. Dems pushing bills help regular person, tv screaming Trump's fascist takeover. even impeached him. 

Both sides same, propaganda outlets delude enough people think are, end fascist dictatorship. 

So please, kindly get head arse.  take extreme position trans people right called preferred gender pronouns, still made argument compelled speech. compelled speech say can't call someone non-preferred term? one forcing call anything names.

Right, omit fundamental universal component language toe line... compulsion there. ""Hey, free talk dear leader can't sing praises"" hilarious think ""your identity"" social setting decide. someone else's identity (preferred gender pronouns) decide. entire argument nonsense.

Incorrect. *exclusively* decide. salience, immediate visual apparancy, utility sex abstraction recognized independently every society existence, precisely *how* *why* uniquely incorporated *structure* language. We're wired identify it, viability genetics depends comprehension construct (sex founded reproductive role, can't reproduce can't identify partner complementary role lol).

In words, assign pronoun, I'm uniquely determining aspect identity; I'm classifying (according *objective* criteria) categorization there's extremely strong *consensus* (because essentially hard-coded DNA). spend lot time reddit see me. I'm fairly center views either ""side"" leaning left. yeah seems like people meet IRL polarized aren't. Covid. Covid big deal  people think behave smart rational manner. Haven‚Äôt seen almost year. yes, makes sense course. would also take temps? fever Election Day, didn‚Äôt vote early? September 1st. also protest attempted murder USPS. Whats even better people unemployed, come Emergemcy Department, psych hospitals take them. sit Emergency Dept sometimes weeks seeing psychiatrist vast majority hospitals psychiatrist staff. people flounder system receiving care need taking Emergency Dept beds needed see COVID patients.  matter atmosphere us. much prefer now.

But everyone else, same. majors cannot replicated.

Labs something home, example. us lucky enough tech, difference bad everyone else. still work, unlike them.

Tech fraction stuff available colleges, yes indeed suck. said, still force college cancel housing two classes in-person whatever reason pay fee. Ridiculous. Even American, I'd wager average Canadian good grasp American federal level politics average American.

But please, keep acting like obnoxious asshole internet, we're terribly impressed it. weird, would think Big Brains DC would everything power *quell* spread, since going election case numbers roof and/or half schools closed really look good (considering administrations past handling pandemic current stance schools), but.....  dunno, like we're *on* Titanic *see* goddamn iceberg, blind idiot faith thing somehow going melt, need give minutes. Death? Shady veterinarian? I'm 22. That's real choice, unless want debt rest life. Honestly, I'm super grateful counter stuff. Essential workers treated like disposable workers. ""accurate"" accurately describe test. simply can't roll specificity sensitivity single term without losing crucial meaning. 

We need rapid test works saliva pin prick worth blood high specificity. Sensitivity 70% would fine long specificity high 90s. False positives would make healthy people isolate, much tolerable false negatives allowing virus spread. Sign work polls can. set goal convince/help three people register vote. thanks suggestion, CDC. positive message democracy prevail.

I'd love see strong voting numbers across states.

Something consider, concern voting in-person election day Early Voting. Early Voting done in-person, check state Second this. I've heard horror stories worst I've someone upset something stock supply &amp; demand, especially webcams, laptops TVs. Seems like that's worked great average American worker far! get commission based big get wage gap? Can‚Äôt wait Thanksgiving!

Since can‚Äôt shoot punch virus, gotta serious problem America. I‚Äôm down, what‚Äôs secret code word? Quick question, think happen grocery store workers days people allowed go store wearing mask? broken anything. intense denial reality. Paywall, mean crock pot? say ""everyone cares"", I?  known while? Fevers symptom always occur. tests often nothing frankly. Dems pushing checks balances reductions power. fascist control GOP.

You falling propaganda, people like Republic falls.  Hey ENTIRELY VALID pissed that. mean Trump handed presidency, mean make excuses amounts shitty stance. Trump suck, DNC beholden big business and/or boomer generation time.

We make progress pretending case. Trump bad, also taking problems Millennials Zoomers seriously, 1000% called it. You‚Äôre assuming turned 20 exactly 6 months ago? reason? greatest bullshitter nothing President office. assume states similar coverage. entire US 2.77 beds per 1,000 people means states pulling average others pulling up. Knowing shitty states medical coverage assume putting pretty heavy downward pressure average. Russia, trials clinical YOU. someone already mentioned, that's deaths. include conditions resulting (and kid live permanent side effect lot longer would...). look link know addressed there.

With said, 26 deaths current lockdown people careful. hell breaks loose, going whole lot more. Though really biggest issue they'll catch spread everyone else. kid (if was, would whole different game) call sick. I've lockdown loss social life (dancing particular), added misery parents, unpleasant people I've ever known.

*shakes hands air celebrate..


Yay!!! Still adds 170,000 dead lmao Dumb question, can't parents leave children home...?


Less dumb statement: wakeup call public school system private nanny market's failure fully replace traditional extended family caretaking. need society grandparents, aunts, cousins, etc. help caretake parents busy. everybody tested, everybody negative, people get infected? Instead quarantining people, needs aggressive contact tracing find going on. Either that, really needs properly inhaled cause bad infection infectious deadly get directly sinuses lungs. something like .5% world population caught virus far, could easily transmission surprises revealed virus much larger spread people remember. Again, wrong. reproduction number always average.

You absolutely clue talking it. It‚Äôs clear still rate time. heard Trevor Lawerance, predict going drafted Lions next year. yes, sound like dumbass, talking like that. Conspiracy theories, media, fact people already angry Obama ""Still understand why"" pushing progressive agenda's federal government. Huh, always runny nose cold. parents recovered covid (dad vent 9 days!) significant hair loss. article camostat mesylate trial difficulties: think I, people reading/voting comments confused perspective. ""Cite sources"" applies someone presenting event knowledge fact requires proof true. 

Speculation inherently A) fact, B) require burden proof. So, think may confused OC. 

What saying essentially two possibilities CDC would say this- *either* A, *or* B. implication subtext org trained medical professionals knows better bunch dipshits think virus real. 

The OP also opened floor asking anyone could think another reason.

So, OP agreeing CDC right (obviously), demanding sources something literally sources speculation, *and* OP asked others' opinions on.

Fucking capitalism really ruins everything touches. still find high levels lead wine bottles seventies, traffic passed vineyards. really different produce, breads, soda, anything else grocery store. touched dozens different hands stocked shelf. god knows many people exposed sitting grocery store gets house.

This wife set guest bedroom quarantine room.  Packages wiped bleach water outside left week opening let anything inside box die. 

With groceries, wipe things bleach water. eating much less fresh produce normal going canned frozen produce this. fresh produce getting, gets wash. also fresh produce cook. huge bummer sandwiches, lettuce onion tomato.

I'll wait. Vaccines need least 10 years developed. yeah I'm injecting untested piss 50% success rate Still evidence mean isn‚Äôt possibility.

It's percentage population exposed virus, thus (hopefully) garnering level antibody t-cell mediated immune response either prevent getting sick next time exposed, keep illness mild.

The health emergency caused recent Covid‚Äê19 pandemic highlights need identify effective treatments virus causing disease (SARS‚ÄêCoV‚Äê2). first clinical trials testing repurposed drugs show promising anti‚ÄêSARS‚ÄêCoV‚Äê2 effects cultured cells. Although 2400 clinical trials already way, actual number tested compounds still limited approximately 20, alone combination. addition, knowledge **mode action (MoA)** currently insufficient. first results reveal inconsistencies contradictory results suggest cohort size quality control arm two key issues obtaining rigorous conclusive results. Moreover, observed discrepancies might also result differences clinical inclusion criteria, including possibility early treatment may essential therapy efficacy patients Covid‚Äê19. Importantly, efforts also made test new compounds documented MoA SARS‚ÄêCoV‚Äê2 clinical trials. Successful treatment probably based multitherapies antiviral compounds target different steps virus life cycle.

Anecdotally, virtually one see wears mask car. Meaning take going places, chance wash hands, likely leads wanting touch face covered up.

And live place lowest rates infection. Yea sarcastic. I'd assume yes still regular viruses based overlap symptoms anyone cold definitely going mentally jump covid much cost?

I‚Äôm mostly worried infection #2 worse, better, get due permanent damage lungs heart. covid end fatality rate 1918 we'd 200 million deaths least, look remotely possible. 6 months even 1 million despite world infinitely globalised density populated back then. 

The reality is, bad things moment, barely register footnote human history terms deaths. suspect social, societal political changes we're gonna see long term biggest legacy  mean considering border closure coincides infection rate slowing border states, don‚Äôt think conclusion well founded. Question, also forced wear gloves time? think ridiculous measure, wearing gloves entire shift. 

I mind washing hands frequently, mean, hand sanitizer every register well. We're meant sanitize wearing gloves orders. get rid gloves? wasteful, often false sense security. Customers see think we're ""clean,"" employees feel like wear gloves whole shift, kinda goes whole idea

And shallow note, *fuck* nails horrible now. They're stripped weak they're normally strong and, tbh, beautiful lol Covid-19 serious... come on... 1918 Spanish flu ? can't handle shit anymore. Stupidity misinformation everywhere. hallmark card gets love either Rome - Barbarian invasions
European empires - World War I
USA - COVID-19?

Every great empire defining events heralded slow decline empires. Could covid-19 straw starts breaking back American Empire hegemony?

Note even is, won‚Äôt happen overnight, America go long, smoldering decline (just like Rome European empires); would interesting see America pre-covid 19 high-tide mark. visit US state. case period 100 days, someone would gone hospital least dr tested.

No, said know asymptomatic community transmission within NZ along. know sure. Jeez breathing heavily, I‚Äôd interviewing mic 10 foot boom üòÇ personal experience tell you: parties necessary 

While healthy alive actually contribute wellbeing person quite lot think measures enough though. CCP declared Wuhan province virus free opened fresh food market case 0 emerged. ordered residents celebrate streets. Yet virus returning homeland.  comment nothing reaganomics.

 middle class hit harder taxes receive less benefits either rich poor. believe brought up.

There indication come anywhere close achieving herd immunity. 

For matter, herd immunity may even possible particular virus. herd immunity possible, may require several million deaths get there.

A policy doomed fail failed. news Swedish nationalists conservatives United States. know real doctor sounds like watch every daytime TV. Thought schools liberal indoctrination centers ? everyone south suddenly pro school lol surprised. still feel like truly felt worst economic impact yet think countries eager go back normal again... Hell, there's plenty countries lifted measures around peaks others well. Also, likely turn race reopen. example: Europe stay closed US Asia fully reopen, vice versa. can't know sure virus came from, can't rule possibilities, neither I. No, it'd concern body kept making years there's threat attack. reason low IFR might significant undercount deaths. test. Covid-death.

Our understanding Viruses/communicable diseases general advance past space age, whole world putting everything microscope. governor opening schools? lol  can't students though people established careers stake industry.  easy replace overlook cogs yet part machine lets try running economy without system's key people maintaining . General managers, teachers, transit employees, service workers across board. tf cares? Trump shining example POS, even naked worm feeding innards snail would attractive vote for, imo. , know, people like him...  5 million tests 1 billion chinese? could known going vacation opening restaurants, cinemas gyms lead this... someone country, I'm genuinely curious; counted ""higher education""? degree university? high-school graduation? Also, much education mandatory US, cover basic anatomic/medical knowledges? happened Flatten Curve - moderation, mask usage, banning large events?

Melbourne tried that, work. tried 5 weeks cases went exponentially. go NZ style lockdown end. rate infection something overwhelm healthcare systems, accept another disease everyday risk life must live get vaccine?

The NZ public health system one lowest rates ICU beds developed world. would overwhelmed time. also one largest populations obese people diabetes, high risk virus. CFR would significantly developed world average. always slips cracks. next, someone accidentally breaks quarantine, cargo worker gets infected, shut nation suspend everyone's liberties again?

No, time unusual inability link index case source, thus need Level 3 know cases. future plan always go Level 2 find new cluster. yet, lauded contact tracing testing program, go back hard lockdowns ordering people shelter place shutting non-essential business?

No, gone Level 4, described. Level 3, 80% economy still open running. Cafes restaurants open running takeaway delivery only. 2 weeks, like last time almost 2 months. time test trace system well place able fully open soon. know participated recent protests outside day went straight home after, none socialized indoors bars, restaurants, homes. people need get behind strong unions. would hard fire replace teachers entire state. bet take certificates. Well, one person still claims regular... endemic Simple accidents birth name, dumb. Please simple accident ""republicans"" last time checked obama continued even higher pace 8 years. 2001 Obama? get paid posts like try farm karma? letting rewrite history accepting Biden Trump. Hell is. stutter. life. rhetoric can't speak losing mind insult people stutters. one last disabilities somehow still allowed made fun of. Oh really? CDC saying ""masks work!"" clear do? Tell ya what. CDC provides mask equivalent n100 mask made sure back February grocery shopping (my exposure) maybe I'll interested recommendations. one learned Sweden. good start, far perfect model. Computer models spread also good starter point mean one UK thinks handled well government. thanks link!

considering Chucalin: resignation raises lot questions. March mentioned one leading experts kind 'doctors association'; lot Russian healthcare workers received manifesto WhatsApp. said 1) implementation quarantine measures unnecessary Russian laws; 2) right declare global pandemic, people dying flu; 3) 5G kind new world order blame

also, Chucalin said he's resigning enough time job ‚Äì he's lead bioethics committee Russian Academy Sciences he's gonna involved committee UNESCO; main source says he's leaving vaccine Alexander Saversky, also says COVID big deal declare global pandemic, people dying wear mask

so, story raises LOT questions, Chucalin actually involved circles, i'm sure resignation bad thing wish. Angus burgers thing really worth getting mcdonalds. realize many higher quality masks able exhale that, right?

Good ones use separate single directional valves input output, stop masks fogging up, keep filter outside input valve, always pulling fresh air, exhaling input valve.

I worry much someone wearing good one like though, people obtained probably reading scientific journals coming China **January.**. That's sold out, least. Swing miss, buddy.

A whole society that's set resemble aristocracy means society set aristocrats (the landed southern gentry owned slaves political power) people live aristocrats. sets roles, customs, tastes, politics powerful everyone else go by. 

""Southerners looking like aristocrats"" doesnt include people serve aristocrats. that's point. Southern society set around small elite - used big plantation owners - everyone underneath them, serve cow-tow jobs status, try mimic them.

Saying mean exact thing like saying peasants outside Versailles nobles inside Versailles. Hence, dont flatter yourself. Republicans: *politicize important issue*

Democrats: *defend good policy*

Idiots: Wow, sides political! never said genetics, said factor. everyone equal playing field. generic variants also metabolism speed, would known actually look information sent. Indivudals weighing 500lbs extreme end spectrum far beyond obese treated different category entirely medically. 200 years ago considerably less energy dense foods/ enough food working class cases course obesity lower. really stupid argument. Clearly Democrats can't since picked presidential candidate can't even speak coherently. many choices, somehow Biden took lead. Goes individuals too. know tons people shake hands get dinner breath near 2 hours problem. Ive actually thought signing trials. way work treating this, that‚Äôs I‚Äôm going get anyway, might well least attempt protect myself. Yeah cause pandemic started later Mexico. even reached peak deaths yet. they‚Äôre worried Russia rushed? ...Ok I‚Äôll show out. thought Putin Trump bestest buds. ‚ÄúRich people give away stimulus never needed‚Äù ""World beating brilliance!"" It‚Äôs they‚Äôre taught. would tell they‚Äôre wrong? 7 continent model taught rest world outliers taught 4 5 continent model. happen taught 6 continent model.

I asked little understanding 7 continent model like argue sake it. Instead telling they‚Äôre wrong you‚Äôre wrong, I‚Äôd prefer everyone chose little understanding. Again, easier demonym people United States, I‚Äôd like see you‚Äôve come with. got people like too. They're everywhere telling truth extraordinary unique States. Considering amount actual civil wars US helped cause around world pretty insensitive referring current state politics civil war. Thank Fauci, politicization virus ridiculous hate wow surprise Young people dumb, you‚Äôre age remember incredibly dumb were, you‚Äôre young, think know everything invincible. It‚Äôs human nature know got 350 million upper bound. World population 1918 1.8 billion already, correct adjustment would around 210 million. Tulsa? Hiroshima? Vietnam? country planet acting like would get nuked US immediately, States exceptional ;S thanks, us Vietnamese Russia guinea pig Yep. BC well, feel like progress thrown away. Worried elderly family living :( insurance stated cover cost. Even flu season, many times ever heard thirty five people one school getting flu ONE WEEK?

This disease almost hilariously contagious. would like know exactly Corona virus behave environment would like make sure understand virus correctly.

1. know virus mainly spread droplets carrier sneeze/talk/cough/etc, though transferring hand touches contaminated surface orifices touches face. correct?
2. long virus survive contaminated surface?
3. step corvid19 contaminated floor, impact launch viruses high enough infect us? worry viruses chance reach face?
4. long virus remain airborn someone sneeze out?

I question REALLY wish definite answer for. tried search online google-fu strong enough. reach articles explain symptom corona viruses behave. hope message rule. make religious issue religion one reasons pandemic slowing down. yep, cause still believe side problem, jailors fauci doc US ? Christ seeing name every second post annoying. superstar ? invented hot water ? virus, obviously.

There community transmission, obviously.

The superspreading family's jaunt Rotorua well documented.

If need restrictions claim, happening.

You sound like one people believes non-smoker quit smoking three times week.  involved magic Conch shell too? necessarily. actually testing arivals. letting leave facility without testing long appear symptoms. case two women UK lie symptoms, got exemption met family members ""lost way"" ""didn't close contact"" lies course. came media, started requiring negative test could leave isolation facility.  none, sorry, deal mess Sorry virtual learning isn‚Äôt feasible long term replacement. Kids need spend time outside, peers. Staying home another least halfear tragedy public mental health.

Borja Negrete

Since Ministry Health implemented new epidemiological surveillance system May 11, total 4,004 health professionals infected Covid-19 coronavirus Spain. According data provided Health, 1,041 cases, 25 percent, occurred ""unknown"" area.

In last week, autonomous communities diagnosed 445 positive cases among health personnel. these, 141 registered symptoms.

The Autonomous Community cases among health professionals past week Arag√≥n, 94. Navarra safe distance, 60.

They followed Valencian Community (39), Andalusia (34) Madrid (34). Nearby Catalonia (33) Balearic Islands (30). least contagions among health workers Canary Islands (22), Castilla Le√≥n (22), Castilla-La Mancha (18), Galicia (16), Murcia (15), Asturias (11), Extremadura (8), Cantabria (4), La Rioja (3) Basque Country (0).

Main sources contagion
-
According information Ministry Health, social health centers main source contagion professionals. total, 846 infected area, 21 percent.

The next main sources contagion health centers workplace, 722 positives detected originating one. followed transmission homes, 383 infected toilets detected. Health determines 289 infections occurred ""other"" areas one school environment. Perhaps. incubates host spreads much higher viral load. WW2 used steal farms Asian Americans.

WW1 caused another pandemic politicized massively increased spread ""spanish"" flu U.S. genome testing latest cases new, seen New Zealand. virus dormant 102 zero community transmission case days. Life completely normal. border shut everyone except returning New Zealanders. 

There‚Äôs point putting restrictions population there‚Äôs virus.  it‚Äôs fascinating actually living timeframe ... like world seriously burning we‚Äôre ride simple homemade fabric mask ""works"", full hazmat gear hospital? Simple masks work sense reduce probability infection somewhat - enough hospital context though. mortgage forbearance runs out, housing values going tank people evicted walk away. we‚Äôre looking combination great depression recessions rolled year 2021.

The stock market indication right brokers still operating leverage simply vanish shit hits fan futures tank. It‚Äôll likely sudden crash worse anything we‚Äôve seen far also buying amounts given aid countries. Here's [free biostatistics take John Hopkins. Problem Democrats can't lot, President, Senate Supreme Court control GOP. Lets hope November.  somewhat needed. UK citizen confirm Bush better speaking Trump way see every dollar spent bomb straight robbery American people. talks people doesnt really sound confident me. 

I guess we'll see. doubt. went appointment. took temperature read 104. surprised didn‚Äôt feel sick. asked take again, 104. proceeded ask Covid questions. reason believe Covid. said may reading high since hot car. waited 2 min took temp 3rd time. read 99. reason behind 100+ cases today?  gave homeless guy mask still refused put on. Basically lowest hanging fruit enforced. Thats america many medications too. pharma company spends billions 10 years new medication people die it, serious sideeffect.

Still FDA approves due high cost times. Americas citiziens test then. goes wrong years, take market.

Btw coronavirus likes mutate lot. expect vaccine last long. like flu vaccine. common mutations thats it. Future mutations covered vaccine Rectal ftw! New York region north Albany 
1. Closed businesses , services , schools , limited hours businesses allowed open 
2. wear masks social distance
3 followed guidelines governor enacted (if agreed ) included state opening phases 
4 playgrounds (most ) closed basketball courts closed sports organized activities closed
5 feel impact homes 
6 found ways active outdoor activities social distancing easily achieved 
7 follow scientific evidence logic 
8 followed countries states see impact decisions respective communities populations 
9 absolutely sit back judge f‚Äî- states like Georgia Florida examples everything . yeah, Ridge, road hell paved good intentions get temperature checked construction job manhattan. guy door scans doesnt even look it. really big joke Ok, people live county South America consider American well, due fact live continent taught whole lives called America, let know wrong, I? really well before, I‚Äôm hot mess. I‚Äôm
On celexa Xanax rarely sleep, eat day get home work, work fucking parties masks, like ignoring hoping goes away. I‚Äôve resigned fact going get work, I‚Äôve back office work home 8 weeks I‚Äôm exhausted decon routine. I‚Äôve thought resuming normal life returning part time restaurant job, I‚Äôm ready give up. one else know gives shit. I‚Äôm point I‚Äôm hoping coworkers get it, laugh masks face shields, give dirty looks VP Sales Manager decided try find anything wrong work since returned office. It‚Äôs non stop every day nasty emails. US deaths per 1 million population: 514

Mexico deaths per 1 million population: 428 fact even discussion makes us embarrassment. We‚Äôre like women bus stop fake Gucci bags arguing who‚Äôs car nicer ‚Äúat shop.‚Äù world wars also quite politicized. I'm familiar history Depression, I'm sure politicized well. Johnson: ‚ÄúOur official death toll one worst world it?‚Äù

Cummings: ‚ÄúLower it.‚Äù

Johnson: ‚ÄúBrilliant! really clever.‚Äù guess it'll like schools, well. Kids able attend unless received vaccine. fact lockdowns needed obvious indication restrictions tight enough. Weird question, friend try supplementing Vitamin Astragalus cutting sugars help boost immune system cut inflammation? anecdotal stories bother maybe friend eating 200g sugar day getting good nutrition taking supplements. maybe everything could make healthier outside water chicken soup. wonder many cases could mild best care taken prior infection?

I potentially caught February someone Vietnam January, testing much thing urge get antibody test since would pretty pointless. coughed lot usual low energy pretty much whole month, basically fine after; taking chances weakening immunity everything could boost it. Madness. Lol come bro. 

Nobody discounting ""bEcAuSE rUsSiA"". People discount rushed really tested it. one virus stood one made puke poop. spread pretty fast work, managed avoid it. Yet everyone seemed catch it, surely must research viruses schools. Serious question: seeing excess deaths year. Would mean we‚Äôll see dearth deaths next year? old people would died. poster downvoted? nothing facts. He's writing new musical, '101 Uses Dead Cats'. birds cannot infected AFAIK Yep ofc, Trump great divisor whining, blaming, dividing, fear mongering cheating. knew missing something! One factor jump positivity rate may fewer Texans seeking testing, Abbott said.  
  positive-test rate jumped record 24.5% Tuesday. Late Thursday, health department posted website figure plummeted 16.08% Wednesday. explanation details provided. think lot places ""trunk treat"" cars. started super Christian way trick treating without God getting upset ""fall festival"" Satan's birthday whatever. think rise internet, people become cautious due information (not saying anything statistically wise changed prevalence information awareness happens world increased). see trunk treats every year non-religious groups. I'm confused, COVID similar SARS MERS? compare corona common cold viruses then? I'm medical expert sure know whole lot SARS MERS never really took foot... but

I read recovered SARS patients still Cells day. I‚Äôm denying closing border might limited virus spreading obviously would, wouldn‚Äôt weather Arizona huge contributing factor well? Like can‚Äôt imagine anyone actually wanting outside day, form nightlife closed. again, Texas pretty bad idk Best one used far suave spray santitizer boss found. Worst one picked gas station, it‚Äôs suppose aloe something softening, feel like um, like know..... Interesting note- dad last week jury duty. first jury/court case since masks mandated area. said judge super perplexed, everyone else, really listen. really feel sympathetic mad person cause expressions, based voice tone story. Pretty interesting ‚Äúantibody surveys show 20% population infected thus far‚Äù

That unfortunately true all. 

17% highest proportion antibodies measured. But:

- Stockholm

- random sample, people choose get tested. 

Data shows national average low quarter that. 

Here‚Äôs recent test data: last week 31.000 people Stockholm got tested antibodies 3.500 tested positive. Less testing means less cases COVID-19. Makes perfect sense. ""thank god im georgia"" study most-likely confirms immunity typical recovered patient scenarios re-test positive later time likely:

1. Still infected COVID-19
2. False positive
3. rarest occasions relapse due area high concentration long period time Yeah definitely. That‚Äôs ‚Äúessential‚Äù lockdowns GA resident here. lot people wearing mask enough make change. Everyone seems agree things need change direct conversation yet everyone keeps dumb shit doing. schools closed. restaurants take only. bars salons closed yet aren't. state done anything real combat virus. We've gotten better ignoring it. Kemp clod one asked for. Personally find embarrassment state making horrible decisions long this. making attempts defund state medical facilities also making practically impossible get safe abortion prior name attempting turn roe v wade. cares ""God"" money everything else means justify one two. He's hot piece garbage landed paper mill. Georgia pro ""small government"" years small government bordering dysfunctional likely biting us ass next great recession/depression. honestly hate going outside now. hate living trust life random selfish idiots can't even bothered wear real shoes Walmart let alone mask sake public health. U R DOOMED I‚Äôm honestly hoping best, thinking realistically. majority doesn‚Äôt trust it, apparently don‚Äôt find effective safe, implying reason believe doesn‚Äôt work least time dangerous take. None sounds good. course not. way conducted: touchless thermometers. covid19 back march ran 40.3¬∞C fever - measured rectally thermometer pharmacy.
When admitted hospital touchless thermometers (yes, plural) showed 37.4¬∞C... There‚Äôs easy demonym people United States Central South Americans. consider Americans they‚Äôre taught 6 continent model rather 7 continent model. Central South Americans taught it‚Äôs one large continent rather two separate continents. It‚Äôs US-centric way thinking, it‚Äôs practical way thinking.

If create demonym people US, that‚Äôs par British, Brazilians, Mexicans, French, Bolivians, etc., I‚Äôd like know. apparently salmonella bacteria. vegan I‚Äôm screwed right now, onions greens outbreaks. Fml. So, saying, win lose.... actually losing either way? Today first day school, wish luck Trump's railing teachers lead demanding schools open. wanted pit people vs teachers advance demanded schools open would base people already primed bash teachers resisted. Omg kidding . Nothing absolutely nothing post correct . live New York State idea talking article community transmission, claiming community transmission.

That make sense all.

There restrictions time, otherwise superspreading events current one.  Every report reinfection anecdotal, evidence points immunity longer lasting antibodies, confirmed cases reinfection, reinfection would happening thousands probably real thing. really don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs thing. possible people infected asymptomatic. Statistically unlikely. possible. new sources revealed exactly 4 cases detected? random test symptoms? tried googling nothing showed up. think vaccinations roll out, we'll see number unwilling shrink. group people longer frightened, people want themselves. also start see industries require becomes widely available, getting may effect employment, something people willing mess with. schools make mandatory, number vaccinated shrink further.

Not mention natural immunity last while, already infected may transmit virus easily, adding total immune would get vaccine. Yeah, needs Life SoCiAl InTeRaCtIOn take temperature soon come in, AC car. Omg.. probably friends, I'm glad friends stupid. That's hellish. I'm GA, too, also taking seriously. past month, I've left home 3 times, twice drive pharmacy, drive Taco Bell. Wore mask anyway. many died? None? saying months. Walk analysis 20% cases detected fevers end R0? Similar. :/ credit - I'm lazy SOB. let stuff sit 24 hours. actually built UV-C sterilization closet, used since early days. I'm bit cavalier ought low - risk fomites, I'm fastidious hand washing sanitation. whether soap water wet - wipes, I'm maximum wetness /coverage. 

I'm far particular aerosols. set N100 masks family time might go crowded place can't avoid it, every-day-wear (EDW?) fitted mask made scratch using two layers non - woven HEPA pre-filter material addition small - weave fabric cover. Exactly, could said public transit restaurant seating. expect every object interact daily basis cleaned last person touching me. course aren't, hospital scans every employee's neck come every day. Guess what, temps regularly 97's nobody bats eye... construction railroad? get vibe McConnell sees Republican Gomorrah coming November going pour gas light whole thing fire way out. anyone Fauci‚Äôs level said anything phenomenon 20% seroprevalence? Anxiously, want know final verdict gee phenomenon hasn‚Äôt occurred elsewhere.. waiting October rally base... believe sooner see happening modern era form slavery sooner progress it.

People need see large portion country continually exploited, worked sickness sometimes death profits arent even own.
I cant compare plantation slavery this, seeing exploitation morally incorrect turning blind eye keeps happening perpetually. 

Slavery comes many forms. Sometimes ‚Äúcivilized‚Äù illusion prevents seen such. fact people chose jobs another reason cant call slavery per se freedom completely illusory. 

They put salary tell youre getting raise. Great. feel valuable. tell working 60-65 hours week business otherwise wont make it, labor costs must come down. business hard work paying someone else. taxes, you‚Äôre making less $10 per hour. 
They told getting raise really took pay cut. lower hourly labor costs save overtime. expense. one week ZERO free time brain health.


The fact freedom people look way, creates illusion something less worse unfolding psychologically bound jobs way miss experiencing life experienced.

It wasnt ok back isnt ok now. They‚Äôre tryna live best lives I've previously heard referred ""hygiene theater"". almost become meme whenever there's outbreak reported news always show people hazmat suits spraying things down. Drives crazy! wish they'd spend resources something actually makes difference. point kind want people get evicted start riots looting streets. Let's go Division 2 shit. That's humanity deserves. virus proven difficulty breaching 60% even densest worst areas (queens). actual death rate shown point less .5%, Based various densities US, think infections 150 million unlikely, infections 100 would likely take longer year now. Even then, that's 500k deaths. 

&amp;#x200B;

I think next month telling. Either death rate accelerate, level begin fall, even school on. believe latter much probable former. 

&amp;#x200B;

Consider, least moment, much death rate would accelerate get within spitting distance million US deaths within year, access vaccine.   protesting spread virus? Yes no. It‚Äôs hypocrisy causing right say ‚Äúfuck im going whatever want‚Äù. can‚Äôt tell people quarantine stay six feet apart say there‚Äôs 10 person max house breathe promote fucking thousand person protest street. Getting corporate money politics good start. point need constitutional amendment overturns ‚ÄúCitizens United‚Äù Supreme Court ruling.

Corporations people. use money talk. One bs court rulings nation‚Äôs history... fast track creating actual superbug? pervasive covid coming short. Cause downplayed virus confused incivil reaction. allowed appalled someone care infecting people deadly virus? Wow heard early Europe case thing. googled real quick found one Barcelona study June one positive sample...have confirmation studies samples? know around rash nasty flu-like illnesses October January negative flu. Probably something else, maybe. virus came bat, makes sense would hire best goddamn bird lawyer job. Well, Ontario less likely Texas say suggest it. Desantis said teachers ‚Äúchomping bit‚Äù get back classroom. He‚Äôs damn fool. Teachers don‚Äôt want this. parents don‚Äôt option keep kids home. whole situation screwed. fever 102, IR thermometer said 98. hand, 5 year old hour outside clocks 100 degrees forehead, arm temperature fine. Basically - forehead temperature fluctuates lot reliable. also hurricane season! YaAAAaa! I‚Äôm sorry essential worker ass working pandemic. They‚Äôre cutting hours stealthy applied food stamps got denied. take 3 weeks nothing us. Yep! Eh, learned /r/EndTheLockdowns stay away old people fine. Like, young people fine. invite enforce mask wearing, responsible.. see virus, there!!!! fail pay taxes. Okay, let‚Äôs assume deaths also higher publicly known

Now two imaginary numbers impossible meaningfully compare

Because they‚Äôre imaginary Bold assume I‚Äôm boomer. I‚Äôm 20s childless Japan fuck doing. Please. discussing function mask, function valved, non valved mask? matters.

You one insisting arguing terms instead sticking functionality. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve done nothing we‚Äôre ideas!!‚Äù lot kids gonna lose parents grand parents. murdered virus, charge made decision. Way late. Trump brought new doctor, spin doctor, Dr. Scott Atlas, called anti-Fauci.        
Have heard? We're going ""herd"". timeline cut speed quickly possible. normal timelines vaccines take 8-10 years... reason, see happens people take time period. asinine speed rush chemical put millions people's bodies clue implications 2,5, 10 years line. This, however, exactly happening.  
You trust flu vaccine, becasue decades research behind it. trust smallpox vaccine data show works minimal risks longterm health, trust hepatitis vaccine decades data show risks outweigh benefits... took decades combined trials studies compile. none ""warp speed"" vaccine highly politicized vaccination arms race, several pushing stock companies ultimately make cut. killed 1/3 Europe's population time. people dying 1500 day single cause.

ive got idea delusion theres reasonable mortality statistic here. one person blame really. Sad automatically search controversial find truthful comments like this. best kind! Seems like getting point may option. Anyone interested balanced perspective read letter: [Exaggerated risk transmission COVID-19 author's opinion, fomite transmission probably happens object sneezed within past couple hours.

I think argument reasonable I'm paranoid fomites. personally wash sanitize hands eating, drinking, touching face, wash hands change clothes upon getting home.

And think article bunk couple reasons. false, limited use informing decisions. done TV station, team scientists publishing paper. concentration viability virus unknown. infectious dose hand-to-face contact anyone's guess regardless. nothing else, find concrete reminder careful. Excuse me, America, make 1 map, McDonald's placemat coloring maze maybe I'll read it. Ooh, ain't edgy Yep. 10 days cool. hope great vacation. Hold up. ""Not one side other?""

Only one side choosing put mask fellow man. side wearing mask's fault? works every fucking time despite fact know damn well nobody ever 100% agree 100%.

I feel conflicted Maybe saved instead buying new iPhone! Finally reasonable comment. 
BTW, Saudi Arabia, Emirates, Brazil willing exactly - test start producing it. 
Mexico, Argentina, countries willing buy. 
Russia good record medical research, Ebola vaccine success too. That‚Äôs measure inside ear, temperature doesn‚Äôt vary much. Holding people‚Äòs heads useless. Eh kept going way around 8G start hitting ionizing. siders dumbest motherfuckers all. Bull. live 50 states once? personally don‚Äôt even know closed them. mean honestly expect kids teachers get COVID? thought plan didn‚Äôt care. even Gucci belt! good thing kids stay school 24/7 never go home families infected. Saying vaccine gone large scale testing easy choice, regardless Trump's investments. 

We basic standards reason, mostly costly mistakes past. wave due panic harm good.

This vaccine unproven gamble good Fauci making statement. local school spent 40k kind system multiple/mass temp checks part plan opening normally scheduled. feel people overestimating effective one tool is.  exactly minimal fuss. Hospitals practicing triage care here. People getting sick alarming rate still. Per capita think AZ still one highest nation. upvote dementia part. detest false accusations. OMG! three random starbursts! I'm cracking up!!!

You awesome mom sister. love supportive network able turn things get tough. Unfortunately, world look kindly (it's getting better!) men show emotions. human too! 

And totally love wall post its! That's wonderful idea! 

I hope better place now. stranger rooting you! source? might wait hours leave system.

Also, check required currency. article 30 days old, I'm sure whether that's recent think old. Look something similarly important recent. Best luck you.  Really. formerly worked area, I'd say masks common UFOs. Nice people, good BBQ (Red Bridges) oof, masks. concern elementary only. middle school especially high school handle home alone say assume I'm pro democrat.

I assure you, not.

This two party system must abolished, primaries must open, top two regardless party move forward.

Politicians spend max 10 years federal level.

Campaign finances must absolutely transparent, even much tipped waiter.

Before happen, elect leaders care less party country, hence leaders willing compromise. they're hiding truth. 
If wanted compare public per capita deaths. 
 
If want get hyper precise, per capita deaths per progress herd immunity much complicated today due pending vaccinations (i.e. highly non-linear). obvious, _was_ main symptom look for. Yes, people able exist fever. one right I've yard hot sun day. think I'm allowed go get burger. anyone info survives transmission cold liquid? order soda non alcoholic drink? safe drink stuff restaurant/bar? Watch news. become 10th story flying crash dummy. So, could someone way well-versed tell means could available things could get back normal? I‚Äôm patient cautious, I‚Äôm also absolutely dying hope. immensely depressing. seriously wish option reject stimulus money. schedule 2020 includes 18 weeks ""recess"" time ""working"" home states. That's one million NEW ones week. Running total much higher... shut crying loud. little. miss that. woodchipper? Much efficient elegant. Great. know fact they're not. show articles day, like, ""Everyone going like normal. Bars restaurants crowded."" know identify n95 mask either? outward facing marking identifying approved NIOSH? TC number? incorrect ear loops instead proper head bands?

[And flatpack FFP2 mask. still trying lie industrial hygienist would agree space requires study data solid gives general idea efficacy various masks. 

And yet insisting study needed make declarations.

Just admit even read study projecting lack effort me. data better data apparently have.

I provided data read already. suddenly changing course? point providing another study going lie reading understanding someone explains you?

Unless admit wrong... Honestly think US population general, due age know important pre-existing conditions, much greater risk even rates higher India. Also come failure US far epic compared anything might happen India. went work fever thermometer detect it. Went doctor work confirmed fever (I kidney infection). Well can't blame immaculate leadership lol Afaik oxford expecting finish phase 3 trials within next 2 months. Moderna expected approved end year. doesn‚Äôt put hands people need them... Afghani close Afghan fair. English speakers use Afghan usually. Even sketchy ""NoTell Motel"" $100 per night beach. may lucky get piece fruit, donut, yogurt breakfast. looking $30-$40 day eating fast food lunch dinner 2 3. $910 minimum week, easy.



Where name brand cruise lines often regularly offer certain rooms certain times year around $500 person. 3rd 4th person 1/2 price.  Even peak times, heavily discount rooms last minute full. ports sail several ships choose week.


So relatively easy couple get clean room, eat like royalty, see different port daily close $1000 week. $1500 four.


And yes, there's expensive rooms, cruises, many ot cruisers staying $100 night rooms look like college kids massive spring break party in. Mississippi, Alabama full, realizing one booked room Florida.... Season. Market. Society. see least three levels here! Fair enough possible food packaging virus live several hours outside surfaces proven begining pandemic also China said recently chicken Brazil COVID it. guess, either virus survived frozen food, know frozen stuff die... Also, several vaccines little behind oxford vaccine lot easier mass produce, like Moderna, Pfizer(which MRNA vaccine, lot easier produce Viral Vectored Vaccines like Oxford) Gonna play find out.  Pull together everyone. leadership decided worth $1200 best! Keep searching online, scored 160 N95s couple months ago. literally sold front eyes online went fast. People US seem enjoying plenty things that‚Äôs kind point. people wanna continue whole thing doesn‚Äôt exist healthy 23-year old male, even want take vaccine. not. normal socialising surely is. immunity didn‚Äôt last three months would seeing extremely large amounts reinfections point. yet see case reinfection.

I think may confusing immunity antibodies. Antibodies shown fade virus 3 months, antibodies way body confers immunity. disinfect frozen goods anyway mentally masturbate neighbor üòÇ lot cooler was. Sadly, it‚Äôs likely true. still feel obligated try forces lot research. ""it leaves lasting damage""

I really wish people would stop saying shit like scientiric fact. go posting studies, remember flu, pneumonia many illnesses cause 'long term' problems. Long term meaning anything weeks.

We concrete evidence new illness causes life long problems Like said, it‚Äôs best get subreddit. aren‚Äôt able parse information accurate way, misinformation sub influence you. 

You‚Äôve proved that. 

There places go, r/covid19 mods allow accurate information posted. 

That best place be. always think odd there's remarks hospital bill, although lot American commenters, solely American Coronavirus sub. 

I'm Australia. know, 30 days, person would given maybe approx. $500 week fee stay hospital, that's needed physical therapy nowhere else go. they're actively treated, 66 day would free, I'm pretty sure. need private health care. Viral photo takes whole new meaning Also people's average body temperatures vary. fever one person 109 degrees Fahrenheit fever another person could 105 degrees Fahrenheit. see working schools secluded ritual areas students don‚Äôt go home whole year Sweden different culture countries. remarkably cohesive pragmatic.

Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Yes, mutations virus‚Äô aren‚Äôt time, across number infections. 20 million infections (likely closer double that) still don‚Äôt significant effect immunity, it‚Äôs unlikely ever mutate rate influenza does, requiring new vaccine cocktail every year.

With covid 19, ton alarmist info. Ways people imagine spread doomsday, worst case scenarios feed already heightened anxiety. scenarios may play out, it‚Äôs important temper wild speculation actually know. must protect Paul F. Tompkins. That....still doesnt change much. Yeah possible countries like Peru even higher death rate reality, yes true Swedens data seemingly pretty accurate, even accounting may place US Chile Sweden aswell. Still well countries.

Swedens data accurate good that, isnt looking good. I'm guessing dont follow NZ news much bit crisis right community spread sure why. need go full lock yet again.

Here's know form herd immunity reached. experiment performed June. ton people congregated large groups course several days see spike cases Northeast.  lockdowns causing drop, able track people started gather outside large groups? would obvious data point. Instead trend line didnt budge.

This science works. Make prediction test it. predict spread would look like lock slowed predict spread would look like natural immunity reached. curve see? 20% Wales different 20% London? No, believe impossible contain virus, yet live city 15+ million people seen case 4 months. Oh, knew, Iraq easier target, war justified *Wuhan Lab 2 intensifies*

/s statment works look countries insane excess deaths. reality Sweden even top 20. find interesting many redditors choose belive countries like Russia, Iran, Ch*na Vietnam would report anything close truth. remember reading country like Ch*na would report 80k deaths pneumonia every year (a laughble number believed fools) reddit. somehow everyone believes them? weird seeing many redditors eating shady goverments numbers withouth questioning 5,334 registered covid deaths 23/06 5,322 excess US 114,038 registered covid deaths 130,546 excess deaths reference, 26/06 Spain 28,180 registered covid deaths 43,900 excess deaths meaning might missed registering 40% covid Moscow registered covid deaths: 3,796, excess deaths registered covid deaths: 9,647, excess deaths City registered covid deaths: 6,341, excess deaths saying purpose btw, stating fact things since people understand count per capita own, excess deaths: population: deaths per capita reality Moscow: 916 excess deaths: population: deaths per capita reality Spain: 956 excess deaths: population: deaths per capita reality 1161 deaths/mil  I've read number articles UK saying may getting fixated Covid-19 antibodies. arguing cell immunity could play huge factor seem get discussed much. others theorised people may already immunity due developing antibodies Coronavirus's common cold. Could much smaller % developed antibodies? Kinda like see virus spreading across globe unprecedented rates say ""meh whatever let come"" quarter million people die. Well, can‚Äôt see loved ones live another country. ^this
It took 45 days Republicans politicize 9/11 portray Democrats ""soft Terrorism"". true independent voter, propaganda manipulation tribalism really started toward picking side. voted Republican since, unless party unlikely come Jesus moment insanity Trump years, never vote Republican again.

I think resistance disinfectant much harder resistance antibiotics, antibiotics need act precisely kill bacteria insides. disinfectants used outside body operate simple, hard resist mechanisms probably would cause damage cells used inside body. pinnacle doomers said freaked out? Also think need learn definition paranoia lol Reasonable assumption. /s costs guys $60 get flu vaccine?

What's next, makes dick fall off? isnt anything make work. isnt classrooms spread virus, happens classes spread it. Kids wear masks. Kids keep distance. 

People need stop stupid. one part plan works another part doesnt, whole plan crap. 

Consider online voting example. wouldnt matter post office money world, Postmaster General removed mail sorting machines. so, bother holding stimulus checks make deal funds post office? matter, state defies Trump sends mail-in ballot, bother using know wont get time mail sorting machines?

There two plans work: Online learning voting person. Newsweek become right wing mouthpiece. guidelines given, let air circulate atleast 10 minutes (windows/door open) every hour air conditioner use. think guidelines based government guidelines (not USA) basically said companies required every 2 hours... Ideally, constant flow would ideal.. honestly think half America thinks it‚Äôs hoax? everybody clapped gave cashier (Albert Einstein) $100. father law bought one checked mother laws forehead several times. would read 92¬∞

I said‚Äî- ok, would hypothermic. Good. Herd immunity win. Darwin prevails. could blame democrats... one would easier... concept adaptive immunity, wouldn‚Äôt circulating plasma cells ability reproduce antibodies upon reinfection? fare bad UK mean success. earliest next year. bad, 'lol'stands 'laughing loud'. ever used ozone generator before? Ozone bad you, think worth it. UV lights tricky use well, lot hand held ones buy actually work.

Most hotel windows open safety (they want people jumping falling out).

Bring cleaning agents surfaces (bleach best), course lots hand sanitizer. Bring air purifier rating least MERV 13, try find one one air change per hour typical hotel room.

For minivan sanitize hard surfaces, take 15 minutes. Maybe take air clean vents, swap cabin filter (if one). Duh guess downvoted saying ""Science Data Says"" rather ""Science Data Suggests"".

This early data would suggest observed sample size observation window. legitimate reason get up, get dressed live pandemic? reading threads, almost like reason live. concerned future there's pandemic? Haha works ü§£ Duh Can't really claim German bombers screaming overhead hoaxes. get point. Mislim da ne razumijete ≈°ta stavljanje rijeƒçi u usta nekoga znaƒçi lol post higher large number votes, lot others share view. fine point view welcome.

I absolutely agree stats data facts come first. Reputable agencies (such CDC) given high probability correct.

It's crazy time moment science shunned voices reason demonized (Fauci / Gates), absolutely understand frustration.

Data, Science, Facts always forefront regardless uncomfortable are.

Peace anyway - stay safe challenging times! R\*p\*bl\*c\*n administration's DUTY save American lives. 


What doing? appreciate. really hope there‚Äôs apocalypse. It‚Äôs real shame become politicized. reaction happening directly result terrible leadership initial response real threat. It‚Äôs hard separate issue politics political leadership despicable complete hypocrisy criticism leadership response Ebola incredible considering death tolls impact each.

Jesus Christ.. Excess deaths COVID deaths. 
For example Spain, worst moment cases, hospital collapsed. operating rooms closed, hospital treatments suspended (like cancer treatments), basically see doctor check up. caused lot deaths too.

So Spanish government hide COVID deaths? really think so. 28C Sao Paulo, exactly chilly. Yes! Absolutely! already sub deficit COVID.

ANOTHER random Redditor knows better CDC! Amazing! person believes moderate social contact forced zero social contact people demand maximum social contact. strawman argument. Ok fine. agree. 

The original comment ‚ÄúI could mask wearing forever. could social distancing forever‚Äù. 

Do agree statement? statement arguing over. get accident, rates go up. dare use service paid for. think that's fair statement well. 

My follow-up got deleted automod ""political"", mainly referring ACA made full time employment low wage jobs extremely difficult due mandatory insurance coverage employer vs leaving employees. special financial reparations younger generations.

The virus care. avoid social distancing wash hands, still done enough virus pleased.

You can't it. it. worked daddy Putin, let's hope Trump manages fuck I'm sorry hear :( though, forever, sense I'm lucky-ish. Like immunosuppressants long kidney lasts, steroids couple months.

Lol west anywhere without oil middle east. Thank get drive job every day. Eh. agree disagree. possible people organizations wrong single point time, generally correct time. 


For example, CDC originally recommended people wear masks, later changed recommendation ""people definitely wear masks"". statements correct, time first statement massive mask shortage USA clear time effective cloth masks would virus. Later, studies came proving cloth masks definitely effective CDC changed mind. 


Should consider CDC overall incompetent based one reversal? No, think should, seems people see evidence CDC incompetent. 


So think question becomes, end wrong, wrong, collectively organization learn anything make better decisions future. 


I read article day pretty much laid blame whole CDC testing fiasco Kushner. Snopes lists ""unproven"" agree them: However, Kushner's fault, might mean CDC's fault, despite poor outcome. Yep, Kemp's head way ass checking well. ""Some"" politicians? think safely say R-words. would expected hear retraction genius? 1 4 students matter.

Ok. listen /s Yup, [cases still Lockdowns useful actions taken.

The government make masks mandatory, use better would imagined, people use incorrectly (under nose, use flimsy ones pretty much open). testing weak. neighbor tested positive family members wanted get tested, well... told reason enough get tested, even though showed symptoms. poorly planned. course can't. like husband wife can't arrested crime. Winner Winner, Chicken Dinner. get number? article says it‚Äôs 0.26.

Here‚Äôs thing, NZ isn‚Äôt mass testing population. think they‚Äôve new cases 100 days popped up- it‚Äôs HIGHLY likely it‚Äôs continued degree person severe enough symptoms actually tested. 

We know significant amount people show little symptoms. basically like happened Wuhan announced imminent lockdown. 3 months anti-corona virus buff... NOOOOOO! Fake news! Trump said going dissaperar freedom murika cares freedom responsibility course can't. like husband wife can't arrested crime. FL wants drive cliff, want riding shotgun. They've ""gone way"" thru BS. time hits 25% probably like 45% due asymptomatic presymptomatic transmission + long incubation time. Thank visual. A: social distancing masks absolutely doable whatever amount time need them. fact people little bitches bearing public health policy.

B: reason believe vaccine within next 9 months

C: children transmit disease teachers, parents, grandparents, people come contact with. something affects children school. Hell, specific case teachers got kids.

Also even low rate children killed disease, estimated 15,000 would killed year reopened schools US. Every single one would name, parents, friends, hopes, dreams. deaths would what, schools dont distance learning? Geographically naturally beautiful, absolutely. possible mass homelessness civil unrest horizon beautiful? No. mean particular school could, theoretically, anymore cases. would nothing actions administration everything dumb luck they're willing double luck. think backwards. 
The Dems protecting rich so..just look hollywood support. sides guilty holding things crap needed right now. Release stimulus fund checks, support money schools reopen, protections lawsuits, funds virus protection support needs. much else needed right moment. Nice stereotype, get impression all. bro, one OU. BOOMER SOOOOOOONEERRRRR. back really beat first place.

Unsurprising correlation profound lack education categorical hatred educators. Sadly think might right. long rich keep making money think care. Really reminds mono/EBV. Lots folks get adulthood end recovery period 6 months never really return normal, developing CFS. Yanks cowardly take direct action. Wonder many died... many people 80 gotten limbs body parts amputated due COVID?

I think two. assume actual number infected twice high reported (obviously severe undercount there‚Äôs way more), 1 10,000,000 chance suffering amputation. Thank helping :) congress ever working? Didn‚Äôt take long break like two months ago? MFers disgrace. Especially one photo face puckered up, pretending give shit. compared numerous preventable causes death... lot people really good saying people (like military,) making sacrifices. they‚Äôll pay lip service ‚Äúsupporting troops.‚Äù But, asked tiniest thing someone else? Nope, it‚Äôs tyranny. believe magical thinking? Like, universe responds attitude things. think many people essentially learn reality consensus attitude around them. think shaming controlling attitude, alter reality.

""Good information"" matter. virus goes away somehow, would matter. But, know, hasn't. It'd lot cooler did. President Trump said vanish soon. Florida plasticized culture fueled paper tiger economy.

Yeah, aint taking either those. one britan india working on? take. Republicans give fuck votes, people.  That's gotta herd. death toll heard/read leads think deadly contagious, maybe even so. many gonna die? I‚Äôm sorry, I‚Äôm doctor I‚Äôm sure asinine layman statement need tell you‚Äôre explaining full picture here.

Excess deaths equal COVID deaths. extended $400 month, also things executive order moronic (payroll tax *deferral* big one). 

Also, it‚Äôll take us get money, since ‚Äústates need set new systems administering benefits, could require considerable time get running‚Äù $100 money supposed getting coming states themselves, federal government. 

So I‚Äôm glad Trump *something* (I guess?), clearly strings attached probably sort catch burn us long run, like payroll tax deferral likely will. schools reopening again? parents get back jobs without stay home watch kids? We're living dystopia people don‚Äôt vote content quality. People mainly vote agreeing disagreeing opinion/facts. I‚Äôll vote quality even disagree opinion someone put time quality post. pay attention mate, trump legally can‚Äôt that. plus states infrastructure it, nobody seeing cent money september earliest. *and* trump also said loses election pay money back. recognize bribery, happens illegal Cowards. Toadies. Sweden expert-only lead clearly abandon process discovers risks efficacy medication

How's harvest year? enough straw?

There two questions: gets make decisions, test medicine? Leaving authority ""experts"" (there's thing novel disease, largely problem) catastrophic.

It appears literally injecting 180,000 people totally untested vaccine candidates March would yielded better result we're now. Even 5 6 candidates killed 100% subjects, seems we'd still better. Even 5 miraculously killed immediate families subjects, we'd probably still better.

We're already worse worst case success. relevant experts dangerously risk averse, wear blinders. optimize subdomain. elected leaders responsible considering big picture, FDA.

The FDA could done single phase continuous ramp would twice fast without introducing significant risk. could improved dozen ways, didn't. FDA similar agencies, whole pandemic would over.

Instead wait phase III conclusions 2022. Sounds like something say convinced virus airborne. Shocker Gee, I'm sure glad Blue Lives Matter folks screaming rafters last 6 months unacceptable situation been!

/s Something ONE HALF country capable of. aware shocking distinctions two major parties' approaches health emergency? Democratic governors institute mandatory masks getting death threats Republican nutjobs campaigned abortion 50 years suddenly decide body choice, plus screw everyone around them. 

Not one side other? *wrong.* ‚ÄúHey man, facts don‚Äôt care feelings bad feelings get hurt. Facts facts... unless facts hurt feelings that‚Äôs different. Facts go fuck feelings getting hurt.‚Äù

Car B) 80 people wearing kinds masks CDC recommends, surgical, scarves, n95 masks, bandanas, DIY masks, two covid positive people fully asymptomatic one wearing surgical mask wears mask Fauci gaps around sides nasal area.

Would rather Car Car B? else Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith going sit waive guns protest said lack education still made bad person.

For ungodly reason got politicised. retrospect obvious would fun see countries put masks left right camps! (my friends Israel say hard right insist masks everywhere).

For care politics enough would wear mask around you. person, someone probably depends you, best infect you. it, sucks.

It's impossible safe guard completely. Really funny original stuff bro! package much It‚Äôs represent states, people. state equal representation House people (and states) represented.

Supreme Court Justices approved Senate (the House say). Supreme Court Justices pass judgment things affect lives individual American citizens. 

If SC involved ruling disputes States, maybe giving State equal say gets court would make sense. SC limited rulings, broad power. egregious examples, look endowment funds Yale Harvard. Need money? Please.

Alternatively, look abundance state schools pump money sports programs. Need money? Please.  mind boggling see responses like ""we richest country"" ""we millionaires""

That means absolutely nothing like 97% Americans, idea banner pride morons

The thing I'm reflecting attempting twist statement. sorry, i‚Äôm interested giving anyone government pass point, i‚Äôm sorry offends views tehehe. partisan politics cancer feeds itself. still supporting system deliberately divides americans pits one another? Hmm good point sake clarity, definition checks influences organization system regulated, typically ensuring political power concentrated hands individuals groups.

While Senate‚Äôs form intention Constitution written, allowing power concentrated solely population centers, implementation 2020 re-concentrates power elsewhere, doesn‚Äôt decentralize it. Tyranny majority fought tyranny minority. It‚Äôs balancing act, it‚Äôs continuous battle two extremes, codified legislature.

So it‚Äôs check balance much spiteful pissing match different chunks population, instead counterbalance institutions leaders. aunt wanting go work random, anecdotal, unsubstantiated proof thing? r word?   pay taxes? understand works. that‚Äôs don‚Äôt like lmao hope so. want anyone die, people really need take seriously like optimism assuming Americans would take vaccine. cases can't even wear mask 30 minutes go shopping without meltdown. No, that's exactly checks balances are. three branches federal government check other, states check federal vice versa. problem, straight name calling things think understand clearly don't.  Oh Wow. Hmm free healthcare never new either. Something seem right here. ü§î  We‚Äôve gotta make voices truly heard! General strike, mass boycott. people can‚Äôt continue sit idly country continues corrupted. senate get nice cushy vacation continue suffer? get Reddit turn notifications   trump campaign weaponized stupidity impressively. You‚Äôre wrong couple different reasons. Checks balances regard separation powers government three governmental branches

The bicameral legislature (a legislative body two houses‚Äîsenate House Representatives) result Great Compromise *not*related checks balances.

Also federal republic type democracy way square type rectangle‚Äîone superset other.

*youre* one skewing conversation true Scotsman fallacy adding ‚Äúpure‚Äù nobody said that. did. 1 single downvote really gets huh think small towns like mine, absolutely every stays apart distances. Mine setup fire hoyse, dont see couldnt outside generally right. small handful pandemics lasted longer (smallpox, black death example). vast majority major pandemics burn 1-2 years, due herd immunity vaccination. sticky ones mutate around herd immunity vaccinations, retain lethality (again, see smallpox). 

I would actually say likely back normal next memorial day, simply extent people's patience. losing summer palatable many keep pandemic down, 2? I'm betting next july Disney packed come hell high water. vulnerable generally wary, watch smaller third wave next summer.   I‚Äôve heard opinions protests Trump supporting veterans conservatives Facebook. 

I think would fire ‚Äúprotestors, illegals, Democrats‚Äù, people quickly told see *real* US citizens. says *up* 3 months, 3 months.

It's proven time.

Also reinfection possible outliers like always.

We would've heard way cases like would 100% everyone.  Sometimes stones, sometimes broken pieces pots called ostrekoi voting someone go exile. get term ‚Äòostracize‚Äô Guess supporter Bernie than.

Midwest (though midwest seems verge outbreak own).  far transmission goes US, surface transmission something worth worrying about

misinformation.

stop telling people wash hands. right. see many ways get around this. Like really cares don‚Äôt host school year. Everyone graduates one year late, won‚Äôt effect anybody. zero confirmed cases.

Its entirely possible covid still active NZ 100+ days, perhaps even couple asymptomatic people slowly pass around another, another person thinks cold, etc  states fighting states PPE Jerk Rod WH stating, ""But (government's) PPE ... going give Democratic elected states.""

Auuugh also says let‚Äôs send kids back school? lots damage pushes timelines back back. this, many starting ignore Oxford vaccine lots ""NoT SiLvEr BuLlEt!!!"" articles keep emerging. That's *technically* true, vaccine actually likely knock issue flu worst. Don‚Äôt idiot. didn‚Äôt say climate change isn‚Äôt killing anyone, said unlikely kill 7 billion people next 50 years. Rather deaths longer less devastating process find hair food...you find tiny virus sounds like serious understatement. don‚Äôt really understand logic parents needing go back work. kid gets virus doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôll likely get them? Kids may even show symptoms there‚Äôs warning parents get coworkers sick bring home kids bring back schools... it‚Äôs crazy cycle right? yup Trump says thing. 

A pandemic 100 years something turn Trump protectionism. 

Hell way, would turning towards UBI little capitalist society want either. points 22 days ago

This going fucking SUCK. going able socialize all. trying REALLY limit social circle whole pandemic (which IMO rated aspect ""Social Distancing""). I'm married already parents wife's parents, thats two separate homes separate social circles would potentially going indoors come winter. dont really feel comfortable expanding ""indoors social circle"" beyond two places right now.

It sucks. gonna nightmare lol may always one realize like back May still thought kids spread virus, know likely spread adults.

The thing Spanish Flu face 1918 technology. ventilators, N95's respirators, understand cytokine storms, supplemental oxygen, still discovered half vitamin supplements medications use support patients. Hell, point viruses still theory explain diseases behave like bacteria. Oh, face Great War, struggled decide dealing Spanish Flu Axis Powers.

For proof, dug Spanish Flu victim buried permafrost finally able identify virus - H1N1. may recall, went another round last decade still good, put western society ass like first time. I'll shocked actually *DO.* economy can't handle another shut down, US already made clear we're acceptable sacrifices alter Wall Street. Yes he's saying limitation hospital beds unique USA fuck value education life.  think united leadership response would make difference creating less partisan environment way anti-vac movement fringe minority.

I might wrong, frequently think. never know shit storm rolling back deaths already occured. gotta fix stupid. 

You can't fix stupid.  ""Mail voting"", distinct absentee ballots, recent gimmick using pandemic justification. claim system would ad hoc, bypass standard checks, full opportunities fraud manipulation. Trump arguing - arguing people voting, greater participation voting.

As funding USPS, task Congress. USPS, like every agency, asking money, justified pandemic. Congress granted extra money.  

All aside, claim USPS could handle transfer ""mail ballots"" without extra pandemic money, used, laughable, substantiated made outside extremist left media. list nations fatality rate per population, Sweden toward top.

I'm sure need content writers.  Yeah, easy ""just leave refugee"" another country. Many people, included, would done simple.

Quite tired line thinking. I've always wanted see 50 states. think I'm gonna skip south. people seem bright. Extrovert US checking say, yeah really sucks. like go techno shows normally 2-3 times month, August favorite month year going festival one state over. partner severely immunocompromised we've almost total isolation together four months now. Grateful much FOMO local dance community's promoters taking seriously refusing put shows even though could (in next state over) someother year someother place mabye not. 2020 evacuees floridians... words, according you, person wears mask valve, someone refuses wear mask. English understanding ""you better than"" means.

Yes. knowingly acting selfish manner possibly cause serious cause harm others, behaving properly harms telling wrong.

And telling reading comprehension problem. said one science denying selfcentered fool bad next. really want get technical, valved mask wearers worse acknowledging disease serious enough protect themselves, enough protect others. complete disregard makes someone like worse someone genuinely unintelligent enough believe everything person wears mask valve better someone refuses wear mask, mask valve lower probability spreading covid.

Again, not. acknowledging serious enough protect themselves, refuse protect others.

And yet again, makes worse human beings morally ignorant antimaskers know better. mean impact more, means worse people obviously know better. Fall behind, never ahead thing, even once. Side effects may include desire run fours, cravings oats apples, sudden neighing cases emergency govt shutdown, senators also receive paycheck. Dont get paid job pass legislation. r/lostredditor find different school district Clearly, countries fared best start. Playbook 101. However Blowhard Trump dimply thought magic would spare America alone cares?? point fingers Democrats act like child, solve? People like get invested political parties reason country f‚Äôd. parties way keep people divided politicians stay power. mean absolutely nothing. Yes. Diet portion sizes United States. 
No one holding gun head making eat super sized big Mac, 100% fault.

If held accountable put bodies responsible for? house passed bill 1200 payments, stopping evictions, extending unemployment? bill 3 trillion? bill 3 would've easily passed senate less 1/3 cost. Great job Georgia, showing care students! Here's commemorative CONGLADURATION trophy, along 100 million middle fingers. WTH Saying ""southern society set resemble European aristocracy still huge influence southern culture"" saying ""southerners resemble aristocrats.""

lol dont flatter yourself. Democrats House passed bill May. Republicans refused take make amendments. failure result Trump, Mitch McConnell Republicans. Remember November 3. they‚Äôre perfectly happy open checkbooks big corporations come knocking, politicians sides preach fiscal responsibility people demanding they‚Äôre owed. They‚Äôre stealing us broad daylight nobody seems give shit like 2 days reopening Willlllllburrr idea. 

I know quit many. Yes, vaccine likely mean return normal. Coronaviruses tend mutate slowly vaccine would also probably last while. said, probably take year finish vaccine trials distribute vaccine enough people create herd immunity. notice actually wearing pants airport terminal? think might bit worse bare feet. mean, you‚Äôre FAR likely spread aerosols talking breathing.

Huh? yes no? Idgi Looks like success Deaths likely go up. since haven‚Äôt yet even though cases rising three weeks ago maybe won‚Äôt. Oh, agree 100%. that‚Äôs think people spending effort keep families safe. Saying seems intelligent pretty condensending. extremely intellegent world class does. scientist thrown political shit show surprise interviews always slickest. can't imagine stress frustration going through. Give guy break. Reddit mirror.  Yeah basically. awful. idea: start airline people no-fly lists. Astronomical ticket rates, mandatory incarceration within aircraft flight. Consent restrained, essentially flight amenities. LOL

side note: love people think Echo Google Hub ""listening"" time, bring would make way sense phones say ""nuh uh."" Basically. much random sadism possible! got rock keeps bears away sell you! Damm.. know vote now. I'd consider lost causes. worth subjecting emotional abuse - I'd drop it. breathable surgical masks, they're hard buy days. would better nothing. actually, someone heart issues probably store point. come conclusion? Inner cities, significantly populated areas, tend much longer lines voting stations. corona they‚Äôve shut significantly polling stations due volunteers calling out. Now, lines 4-6-8 hours long, aren‚Äôt moving damn near, due virus new polling equipment undertrained staff. people unable vote, lines stop accepting new voters set times. inandofitself voter suppression heavily affects democratic (inner city) populations. 

Now, take US president‚Äôs attempt stall vote mail, best option disenfranchised tactics. Rural areas always shorter lines, aren‚Äôt affected heavily two combined tactics. Rural voters tend republican.

Edit: point being, increased mail voting would greatly benefit inner city democratic turn they‚Äôre already heavily disenfranchised current COVID standards voter suppression tactics. Allowing would absolutely president‚Äôs best interest. 

Keep mind scientific critical thinking minds (educated) tend democratic, likely listen scientists doctors say it‚Äôs unsafe go out, crowds, wear mask. They‚Äôll significantly less likely vote person. hand, republicans laugh vote person, without caring get sick spread virus (because ‚Äúit‚Äôs hoax‚Äù). They‚Äôre also less risk significantly likely crowds (rural) polling stations. someone told /r/politics, ""they work harder money do, 24/7 solving this"". Bugsy gets it. It‚Äôs mix everything. I‚Äôve seen people upvote advocating concentration camps people don‚Äôt socially distance. let people outside? Lol sounds right reddit. No, genuine concerns tyrannical leaders end game forcing permanent long term masks us demonstrable negatives them. refuse hear cause want consider side selifsh monsters still think wearing diaper mouth key stopping thing. lol.  ""Ignorance stupidity around me"" yes. city 10 people 10 people infected another city 10 million people 10 infected, city would say infected? wish actually something hundreds thousands unauthorized border crossings year.. ready play chicken train. get good news? indication article couple parents. [18-24 year olds main purpose college stupid come [get beaten replaced semblance  saying true would expect see peak days decrease tests account test result lag time.

Except USA opened schools testing done (and reported) generally indicate huge mistake.

In short, ""this gonna get ugly, fast"". Troll reporting actual facts

There lot datasets look You‚Äôre delusional think something like would actually work. aren‚Äôt anything need them? I'm fucking car idiot. wear mask work 10 hours day. keep lying I'm sure Trump pick you, bro. special special boy parent would withdraw kid  upset? won‚Äôt anything someone dies direct result. then, dismiss keep stupid idea covid doesn‚Äôt exist going virus coming back Wuhan ? Thanks trying trump. Reproduction number. Amount people getting infect one single person.

R = 1 means spreading factor control, one person infects another person. growth easy get control. Ugh $ insurance company believe vin number before. Abbott general point. make statement like thief tell it‚Äôs going suck wallet anymore. He‚Äôs taking heat future high case numbers. Something worked hard beginning. must mean herd immunity much lower % thought. soon know whether need hospitalization. real issue pass others close contact with, may fare well. Way less hell previous pandemics we‚Äôve through. one stupid small death rate. people going die economic fallout virus itself!  say rush herd immunity now. We‚Äôre almost already.  .....doesn't seem running brains xD think best case scenario would beginning next summer. That's get change administration takes virus seriously. going take year develop distribute vaccine. think solve lot things. can't solve people react execute. clear simple things screwed people, even purposely variety reasons. lack faith scientific method. lack faith people. Actually, sub quite fickle. I've downvoted saying wipe groceries. Shame. I‚Äôm sorry. hope feeling better.

I‚Äôm afraid I‚Äôm one ‚Äúlucky ones‚Äù crippling social anxiety found longer needed anti-depressants anxiety medication throws shutdown. nice experience life way.

Lol makes sense üòÇ ‚ÄúFlorida North‚Äù get random two week vacations? people happy get much, certainly take millions people waiting literal lifeline.

Privileged bastards. death cure stupid inevitable cause death wear mask heat large groups people proven wear mask greatly reduces chances transmitting getting disease. Fair point. read top see 0.65 takes account symptomatic asymptomatic Really hoping sweet sweet stimulus money Christmas, Hanukkah, winter holidays might cancelled well. least partially lot people.

Man, I‚Äôm sorry hear that. 

I fortunate gotten unemployment lost job, already moved dad problems life, much accidentally spared worst people age dealing (still file bankruptcy though, I‚Äôm even 30)

We rioting streets this. Wealth inequality lack basic social services real problem, lot people don‚Äôt see that, reason. Everyone want these, future costs get compounded longer fuck around. Yes blame congress, outside confirming judges impeaching presidents don‚Äôt seem much else. administration gets blame chief staff quarter backing he‚Äôs one fiscal conservatives; quiet mouse corporations got bailed pockets deep it‚Äôs time help actual public.  Perhaps, shoot arsonists.

I think revolution coming. think half country could literally homeless starving death yet somehow blame Obama this. That's Jordan Peterson's ""thing"". speak abstract metaphors actually mean anything. There's zero substance. makes think ""clean room"" ""lobsters flex"" meaningful they're really not. Who's bragging? think projecting feelings. /r/empiredidnothingwrong leaking opinion, facts. wrong delusional getting called point game either hyperinflation. mean already printed $3 trillion less year, want add one more? situation we're fucked matter road choose 
1- let people back work, infections spike health care system collapse 
2- print money contribute hyperinflation 
3- give stimulus checks see massive eviction catastrophe collapse real state market. 
If star tearing Mandarin wow trump evil making executive orders help people. enough cash everyone that. know material mask, valve works, even valve, etc.

How think usable data?

Especially authors even say usable data presumably unaware mistake making even less usable.

This level scientific illiteracy alarming. also says data recent weeks incomplete. Besides, summer months generally lowest amount deaths look numbers 2017-2019. ""August 2019, interview CNN's Anderson Cooper, Biden asked people think Biden administration ""means they're going come guns."" Biden replied, ""Bingo, right assault weapon. fact matter illegal. Period.""""

He said is, that's enough make *never* vote buy minute. Pause? agree you. wife discussing sending kid school Sept. first month school opening, think good idea. 

Too much still unknown. days go keep hearing people developing neuropathy post covid. someone suffering chronic pain nearly 10 years (with neuropathy), wish upon anyone, let alone child. callous all, dumb question, honest answer. Username checks out. protests spread virus yes no? Like said, there's nothing makes Jordan Peterson fans upset quoting Jordan Peterson. 

""It really toughest lobster wins. what's cool lobster lobster wins flexes gets bigger. he's winner, he's advertising that. neurochemical system makes flex sertotonin... chemical affected anti-depressants human beings. like... depressed like defeated lobster.""

He goes say whole lot drivel suggests hiearchies important human societies they've existed since lobsters. watch whole video want fairly useless advice.

 

That's rub Jordan Peterson. zero issue people want better themselves. issue Jordan Peterson gives awful, non-nonsensical advice like ""be like lobster"" ""clean room"" people struggling. PCR least 20% false negatives, patient high temperature, coughs, theoretically peak transmission. 
 Florida maxes $275 week total cap $3,300 Pretty sure thats going happen, Trumps signature check. almost like they're worried elections. Hm... Weird... didn't.  they're closer constituents needs organized protests outside residences. Katrina also proved face true chaos, cops turn tail run. concrete/absolute way interpreting professor's statements. Try thinking abstractly... think scary tbh. mutations ability spread. way would match Spanish flu outspreading death toll case fatality rate deadly (though deadly dont get wrong) kidding me. BREAKING NEWS: Water wet Sounds like decent course action decide leave. weigh pros cons go gut. Best luck - tough times many us right now, one reason another! I‚Äôd settle Senate doesn‚Äôt get paycheck unless legislation passes versus breaks betwee fourth time telling leave alone.

Stop harassing me.  Protesting necessary stop murders black people hands police. also one rights US. vast majority protestors wore masks protests outdoors spread much lower.

On end, going motorcycle rally necessary global pandemic right. Virtually none people wearing masks crowding bars together. two comparable, like all. Vaccines still needed want chance keeping perpetuating/becoming seasonal, also can't. Yeah, good luck Tony  much issue degree issue obviousness. obviousness causing sense increase. biggest marketer vaccine Trump, he's guy says windmills cause cancer. taxpayers. representation small voice actually government. TIL; we‚Äôre fucked originally thought lol course still counted, go death certificate.

So disingenuous. Yeah, go different list part official covid tally like 5k deaths took off, counted. That‚Äôs correct, instead jail paying hefty fines he‚Äôs chilling Trumps cabinet. two party system joke, 2 sides coin never going move. whole plan stonewall allowing Trump pass executive orders makes look like hero. 

I‚Äôve telling family friends getting excited second stimulus isn‚Äôt going happen. it‚Äôll right election it‚Äôll come executive order. way going approve deal congress November. someone went best shape life,seeing abs everything like catching covid march put 60 lbs permanent lung damage, please listen person! I'm financially ruined body ruined well 20 % health system could cope 1918-1919. Except limited areas (Northern Italy March, NYC April, Spain April, UK April/May) avoided lockdowns, masks measures. could similar numbers deaths Spanish Flu. ""Flatten Curve"" mainly keeping 1-5 % (or lower could assed keep basic measures place) instead 10-20 %. People seem forgotten 3 months time successful (yes, even USA Brazil, despite shitty overall).

And someone brings Sweden: measures (all schools outside Primary closed) managed CFR pretty bad 6.7 % laissez-faire approach brought Covid-19 retirement homes. US 3.2 %, European countries (but lower numbers per capita cases mortality obviously), Vietnam 2.2 %. Italy, UK, France, Spain CFR 12-16 %. Average rent DC $2200 People go vote person? Great, lets concede counterfeit N95 mask valve. even counterfeit N95's valves better cloth masks. making progress now! Excuse me, don‚Äôt use word Lord‚Äôs part country. Suicides increasing steadily since 2000 hard figure big factor Covid is. ""Alright, problem's doozy, favor packing going home?""

Un. Fucking. Believable. response actually something job description:

""Aight, Imma head out""

Oh, get paid it. like let students decide school year. (which reason) Italy suspended mortgage loan payments months lockdown. America fucking stupid. #DontBeASpreaderWearAMask Bruv fuckers ANYthing? Christ two week fucking break fucking two weeks ago It‚Äôs time bring original ‚ÄúJoin Die‚Äù flag, hold people three words. I've seriously enough people. Go fuck pointy side rake boot licking garbage pretending human. Shame u!

Jk worries. wanted clarify. Everyone getting herd immunity strategy, happens fail. herd immunity 90% population it, estimated 1-2% mortality rate (including asymptomatic cases mild symptoms, based antibody studies). idea many deaths would cause? capable basic math? far 1% people wind permeant lung damage. describing catastrophe. enormous catastrophe. Especially know long immunity lasts, may little months infection.

It's also really stupid, alternative strategies work. real world examples places nearly eliminated covid, significantly less cases per 100 population USA without significantly damaging local economies.

And clear, US could eliminated covid early locking early slightly longer did. Even disregarding that, people criticizing schools reopening generally calling full lockdown, simply pointing schools going accelerate spread disease unnecessarily, children teachers going die it. school even practicing social distancing requiring masks slow spread disease. lock entire economy mandate distance learning, mandate social distancing masks schools. hard visualize Trump vision resources coordinate across multiple states.

You mean, like win national election.

Yeah. Hard imagine. Good one. Sir. wise brave leader, even discussing lack vision resources, wink-wink. Storm houses live them. Thanks this. took online option, think angle. Taking vacation pandemic many suffering. Lazy fuckers. I'm calling mostly BS this. work large Healthcare organization get screened we're allowed buildings. exactly it. That‚Äôs political party bs exists, divide people. I‚Äôd love see national strike. Quite frankly think *need* national strike right now. true, could accidentally drop cigarette butts time set country back stone age night! Lol kidding course, quit smoking would never advocate people set fires EVERYTHING ONCE. would mad! would accomplish? Besides, last riots anything go by, happen 10x. cops really coping unrest well probably hoped. mean outnumbered 1000 1 really stuck chasing tail looters arsonists run location location time get they're gone. guys like spout amendment owning guns. properly meant rule lets take arms government.  Basically right force election feel representing people anymore. Thanks , nothing Politicians. Yeah, vote red.

Sure may damage dont know isnt gonna kill them. moderate severe cases would've definitely killed lot people though.

I think covid terrifying due fast spreads easily people spread it. happened then, could well spread profoundly matched overtook Spanish flu death toll. dont feel like case fatality rate would higher virus seem deadly. fact covid scary propagates spreading without killing.

Of course I'm doctor scientist. I've watched ton Spanish flu documentaries. think people look covid terrifying reasons scary (spreadability, things said like longterm damage, etc!) without comparing two since pretty different

I armchairing certainly trying dismiss covid Except counterfeit mask real n95 respirator, surely relying bad data make claims, right? established tried lie kind respirator was.

Epidemiologists know fucked are, everyone else sit down.

Edit: unpopular opinion; experienced, educated, credentialed peer reviewed subject, opinion matter much. even mean? last month they've 2167 cases per 1M puts 40th among states.

Get fucking acts together, willya? haven't, nobody alive times except 9/11 making decisions.. decisions made due 9/11 catastrophic several reasons happens:

False negatives still high.

Colleges closed systems students interact people campus.

Professors/staff interact people campus go home family members work go school elsewhere.

I'm happy 3 months really hope lot longer. like temporary armor. mean /r/Vitamin, right? Perhaps provide quick context. governors California Nevada taken county-by-county approach dealing covid. counties encompass Lake Tahoe republican mostly rural, 90% counties affected COVID Tahoe region choking. counties power, refuse anything help Tahoe. 

Also, local government quite powerless here. power stop people entering basin, shut businesses. really vocal extreme rates tourism we're seeing pandemic, pretty quiet...

Basically, though, lack control taken county, state, federal govt, onus people make good choices forego vacations summer. seeing ALL. Ask local, whether think covid hoax not, agree busiest summer they've ever seen. batshit insane guys. Every single campground booked October.

Anyway, yeah living tourist destination surrounded republicans fucking sucks rn. False security people. one hand, unnecessary risk sense that, well, necessary activity there's risk. 

On other, sounds like they're making safe possibly can. Outdoors, separated masks sounds safe gathering COVID could possibly be. would restroom situation work? 

I think worry part understandable, hostility perhaps bit far (though understandable also given stress this). sounds like they're everything within state guidelines within recommended protocols must get together. 

We know lot transmits did. know outdoors far preferable indoors, masks better masks, spacing/distancing better close together. outdoor fans circulate/dilute air around, even better. 

Given that, assuming everyone adheres distancing/masks, think sound risky, relatively speaking, gathering COVID era. get this. getting job, constantly take 2 weeks child quarantined going solve anyone's problem... concur. live small town north Atlanta people wearing masks/practicing social distancing. shops restaurants open busy large crowds. local social media comments filled large population county still believing Democrat hoax, flu worse, ""rights"" assaulted, Jesus keep safe, etc. like living one big meme.

Anti maskers called ‚Äúspreaders‚Äù instead.

Aren‚Äôt good 6mo Well good thing 1918 anymore! pretty sensationalist far CDC concerned, primary purpose convince people get flu shot. Buried way fold last paragraph statement probably larger impact flu anything... fact we've removed ways flu spreads.

COVID far contagious flu, ""flu season"" named virus exists cold weather, people close contact spread cools down. COVID precautions go way beyond we'd need effectively squash flu regular year. year, next year well. Because, likelihood, still crisis next hurricane season. anything measure differentiate two? school rate could actually much higher. ones congregating closed spaces together hours everyday. people selfish. Risking life at-risk people know get away little rain. what's wrong America. mean, I'm glad like point much want take credit it. that's works. likely comment got removed mean I‚Äôll say instead. 

People evacuate hurricane yes. It‚Äôs ‚ÄújUsT sToRm‚Äù. Hurricanes kill people destroy homes/infrastructure. 

Your points yea. America needs help better leaders.  Time flies having... hmm. swear used able finish sentence. mean state highest population highest number cases? Groundbreaking. Yeah, lot folks /r/medicine saying flu season stopped flat social distancing, lockdowns, etc.

That's eye-opening statement much transmissible coronavirus influenza. weak sauce response best, coronavirus way us result. Yet sauce (apparently) stopped flu.

This deduction made purely empirical anecdotal evidence. anti-vax community inflate amplify studies show flu vaccine might increase risk contracting coronavirus, millions fewer people take flu vaccine year, bet. Sad thing is... Democrats take over... people shit clean many messes... honestly, current president stays office, hell make things worse...yet things still bad either way next years... better start making repairs making shit worse. Imo. 

Stay strong...vote least good job. Think presidential elections big interview hiring process. Presidents work us (we pay either taxes), way around. Unless work directly government (chances are, don't) Comedic consider ""The GOP coming gays!!"" song different audience.

COVID20 reach, sadly dare mention protests Idk let‚Äôs offer 15 cent movie tickets customers come back happy forget virus Plaid! Finally stupidity thinning herd. outside helps, sunlight kill virus carrying spreading coughing touching. Deceptive answer best But... South Korea another spike cases doubt . Colder weather would mean Mask wearing . First all, first paragraph relevance coronavirus rest nonsense. Second all, riots protests strongest 100s thousands people participating hundreds cities around country. Minneapolis, couple protests 5000 alone.

Fyi, turn pms/dms settings. well fact verge potential civil/racial war pretty shittty disease goes away without everyone following rules, still to? 

It kill millions US do. sleep shared responsibility, sure go ahead, still major asshole that.

We could also sit tight, wait out, like NZ. sat tight shut 3-4 weeks, could eradicate disease (like NZ), that's bit utopian larger country, sure, sitting tight listening scientist bring us eventually, even wait vaccine. nature legislation, fixes issues creating others.

I thinks accurate say create legislation everyone finds loopholes protect profits.

For example, insurance companies limited much premiums could go year made higher copays deductibles. swear one idiotic conservative tell gone election I'm gonna blow fuck up. (some) North Americans strong dislike masks? (I saw protests Montreal). someone explain? country open TB patients quarantined special sanatoriums since WWI. one would ever make fuss it. COVID quarantine home people self-isolate still checked upon local authorities, normall daily. Breaking quarantine heavy fined lead prison. break supervised quarantine state facility (normally cases flat someone watching entrance 24/7)

If big outbreaks police authorities wall-off whole block. One Bavarian village literally sealed police firefighters.

Let's let perfection enemy good. 


There world difference small outbreaks fork useless attitude USA. Civilization? flu threshold then? Anything flu deaths = okay, anything = shutdown? really wish people would press harder shit like this. Like fucking gall man. Higher chance death. can't find article believe Italy Israel found large number patients died Covid also flu. minute. According study 339,000 children tested positive covid US. 

We know less 100 kids age 18 died covid. tragic it‚Äôs likely majority conditions like asthma. 

But accept studies numbers regarding infections that‚Äôs .0002 death rate. perspective. 

I two children support staying home distance learning state still one hot spots country. 

We find really soon guess risky children. near 98%. Stop spreading misinformation. wonderful thing! allow people make decisions! 

I one, excited crowded room couldn‚Äôt live without it! need place allow option it! Social distancing forever regards nationwide policy isn‚Äôt option. Social distancing forever personal choice is. Well twice likely die black I'll go  That's really acceptable. take tenured. Whats really depressing USA look recover done.

I read articles ages empires rise fall many years, America starting look weak world view, possibly meaning time major influence world declining, to...depending recover nation....which right looks like total shit.

Thats fucking depressing. cloth fine? We're talking N95 here, ones without holes them. ah yes, good old politicians. Take breaks actually work. joke. fear, $$ time skim it, looks like 10% came \*simulation\*.

They‚Äôre idiots party whined seat belts, swore economy stock market would crash Clinton‚Äôs tax plan, fought gays marrying, thought stem cell research murder, didn‚Äôt believe global warming, swore WMDs Iraq, believed obama born Kenya, thought kids faking getting shot schools get guns taken away, thought Trump cunning, thought racial bias law enforcement. 

It never ends. Bah! Touch√©, like lawyers judges old? fucking child  Christmas, Hanukkah, winter holidays might cancelled well. Parents find way explain Santa couldn‚Äôt come, etc.

Uh, something stopping parents giving presents kids? live them? would ***loved*** school outside highschool. 100% work well winter. system even governor admitted intended keep people getting anything. Oh..its going happen..100%..just like Disney re-opened best? Haha, realise that's diplomatic shittalking right?

Much like Chinese people shittalk Taiwan people call frogs, intention criticize make better, rather influence dog whistle. criticize actually make things better take tone. That's easy enough concept understand right? True, even want think planes passengers arrived without getting tested... Saying people would rather sit home work fucking insulting million people want get back work. Even choose sit home extreme minority everyone. Besides, fucking cares someone makes little months? 

Turn Tucker Carlson look data. People want get back work. people aren‚Äôt getting pay raise unemployment. Right! it‚Äôs totally okay think right now! Sure, might kill number people spreading places nobody avoid like grocery stores pharmacies, hey, get want. make seem quaint bloodless. Thats cute H.O.N.D.A. that's case schools close. That's normal USA. Even people school dies. authorities say good job meanwhile people literally starving lost jobs due POOR leadership.

I wish could say no, fuck twats, pay checks you. want job, must free like god damn volunteer firefighter. California already 66,000 homeless ONE COUNTY. one party helping one party hurting. One party passed bill would extend increased unemployment, help small businesses, etc, sent Senate. party threw trash. 

GTFOH ‚Äúboth parties‚Äù shit. House bill already passed Senate two months ago, never problem. Party struck again. I've searched can't find evidence that's true. need provide source. would anyone want get tested then? type authoritarianism also great argument 2nd amendment  bringing love! lol 41 hours oddly specific 1% large number die end excess deaths statistics.

But Covid statistics clean, deceased sure lockdown. True. That's longer ""like"" post friends family say tested negative virus. stigmatizes positive test, likely fault own. sobering quote sure. I'm baffled different. We've pulled events. one?

To clarify, 911, politicized. two. things really changed much generations?

I like automatically think I‚Äôm shallow stating reason people wear masks. didn‚Äôt say people wear mask acne. People kinds things cover acne. People apply heavy make damages skin, spend thousands facial treatments, drugs, procedures. even skip school work embarrassed are. really bad acne damaging one‚Äôs self esteem. wearing mask normal, people could put one go lives without worrying people think. worry people judging liberating. stop taking everything bad faith assuming worst people, you‚Äôll lot happier. hope great day spend quality time people love. Thanks man wish people would realize rules suggestions drafted experts they're evil government conspiracy. I've distancing (super easy me) keeping bubble 10 even I'm careful.

True since everyone going going self-quarantine contribute community spread (I mean, people aren‚Äôt complete self-centered jerks, right?), fine!! Time turtle soup Undoubtedly contribute spread virus. Americans become sensitive mentioning kind sexual preference race. said that, protests take place outside, virus air gets diluted chance contagion extremely low; contrast schools spread almost guaranteed, stadium protest fans gather shout scream together. all, good idea people gathering pandemic ravaging country. Enter bureaucrat. true rulers Republic, payroll Trade Federation, might add. Chancellor Valorum's strength disappear. absolutely. trying see similar term kind theater.  
Cleaning theater? surface cleanings, instance, really helping airborne virus. Airplanes understand carry HEPA filters. filters catch particles 3 microns.

The virus 1 micron. So, wrong. hear Fauci say, would fly. biz allows fly many places nearly time. go near airport. reckless.

The poster, above, refuses acknowledge status virus circulating US. recently middle America, town claims gateway Yo Semite (obviously Jewish summer camp). town 4000, nearly 200 homeless care one iota virus, hispanic, women wear masks men posture invincible. service industries there, one damn person wore mask, mid 40's mid 20's. saw lot them, I'm interested.

It's fine say conclusive evidence COVID transmission food. also conclusive evidence safe. WHO? WTF? liked Bernie's ideas part, think radical candidate run Trump.

Personally rooting Yang Buttigieg that's I'm sure understand paragraph posted. Multiple studies shown valved non valved N95's provide equal protection addition, investigated effect exhalation valve protection factors (PFs) protection levels might decrease due leaks exhalation valve. Therefore, included two N95 filtering facepiece respirators, otherwise similar except exhalation valve: one (N95 Respirator C), one (N95 Respirator minimum PFs observed size range 0.04‚Äì0.2 Œºm. **No significant difference PF results found N95 respirators without exhalation valve.** actually saw depends state, actual number $300, $400. believe read news article tf knows... also, 1600$ month great amount, especially mouths feed aren‚Äôt own. Average rent many cities around $1000, including utilities. Add car payment, health insurance, phone, $200 left get by. That‚Äôs crappy. Obviously depends live, it‚Äôs rough many people. Well assuming lives then. Thanks Obama!  Unless you‚Äôre high density environment able walk without mask all. feel bad step-daughter's half sister going entirely screwed school goes online-only. mean, reason step-daughter lives us full time...

Our school district guilt tripping hard people choose online-only model, emotional blah blah blah. Emotional health way worse step-daughter brings home unintentionally kills me, high risk stepmom. (She would know her, one else leaves house except medical appointments.) every news article going show family isolated beach work federal government Americans work private corporations. Sick leave, vacation pensions something federal employees entitled to. Guess missed global pandemic almost 200k dead people country. sounds good except Republicans don‚Äôt actually care education. need schools open childcare function. need people go work can‚Äôt make unemployment claims. unemployment, among things, woefully underfunded effort give super wealthy tax breaks.

This isn‚Äôt education them. It‚Äôs money. think mean GOP senator. far know dems pushing kee working. Time vote! know are, I? people surprised point? Nah. That‚Äôs legit Georgia‚Äôs governor said ad. people actually work? recess? basic skills

You right - parental attitude involvement huge. scare anyone idea homeschooling...

It's true everyone, need teaching credential even necessarily college degree succeed. ""succeed"" mean end kid well-rounded, knowledgeable, articulate, college-ready. Masks comfortable. Stop trying defend wearing valves masks don‚Äôt like masks actually job. 

Again, links slew scientists confirming this. 

Don‚Äôt trust CDC? doctor expert enough? slew Canadian whole bunch information best mask don‚Äôt think we‚Äôre far apart. surprised people surprised Trump lies lies themselves. 

The reason get terrible people running positions power system tired needs refreshed - it‚Äôs time [Fourth Trained dogs. Nazi Stormtroopers must sent back hell.

Thank you. go shopping ordered everything? this, crowded school countless examples, like people forget ubiquitous cameras are. Lol pretty much continuing largest regressive taxation system hurting poorest Americans pandemic too. think it‚Äôs good idea even it‚Äôs insanely classist, means fewer kids end back large classrooms year, lowering infection/transmission risks students teachers and, nice bonus, reducing class sizes something approaching sane number, potentially improving quality classroom time.  Fortnight fail day. aren‚Äôt even jobs ffs Wouldnt trick coughing face? terrible crime, trick nonetheless  Wow. thought would actually get something passed month time literally got nothing done. went vacation. people dying. people going homeless.

We retail workers acceptable sacrifices. That's is. I've seen many people say ""the solution pandemic everybody stays home gets ubi"" asked solves anything essential workers answer ""well take many keep supply chain going"" going tell somebody telling I'm acceptable sacrifice, know is. Speaking everyone know personally, dawning realization generation never going good life. First economic crisis, economic crisis, climate change, beginning end democracy, global plague forcing us work, industries shutting down, obvious way back, realistic hope things ever get better.

But White House Senate seem strongly opposed funding testing/mail-in ballots/enhanced unemployment,etc. seems ~~probably~~ screwed. I'm pretty sure noped Georgia ago. democrats asked 3 trillion, Republicans came back 1 trillion. democrats offered split difference, 2 trillion. good enough.

If mainly sticks respiratory epithelial cells enter blood stream much going see much immune response.

Once hits lungs, heart, kidneys endothelial cells lining walls blood vessels going get much deeper penetration much robust antibody response.

All see announced Thursday new rules:


‚ÄúThe Government send confirmed community cases Covid-19 quarantine facility instead allowing recover home.

This already case cases found border hotels, previously position New Zealand contracted virus.

Health Director-General Dr Ashley Bloomfield announced new rules press conference Thursday, announcing 13 new cases Covid-19 much CCP pay post here? expecting Biden heal wounds you‚Äôre gonna bad time. I‚Äôm pro trump don‚Äôt get people thinking Biden white hope? Get guy front crowd.  study blinded, one knows got placebo got vaccine. researchers need certain amount data, including certain amount participants contract disease, wrap study. point haven‚Äôt enough people testing positive Interesting way look significance neutralizing antibodies relation virus two points: 1) even p value cohort 3 hardly suggestive broader trend among human beings 2) correlation causation can‚Äôt certain whether 3 patients really exposed not. assume that. check numbers see Canada's well. problem Canadians Americans they're always comparing other. Every single country planet better USA, using USA compare smart. Remember Brett Kavanaugh? school district AZ that. course, next town f2f classes starting Monday. Insanity. Doubtful Nancy knew going happen yet choose negotiate. No, like literal snow, accurately, frost seriously understand mindset. whole world this?  Hint: one US many cases giving em one helps keep spreading though ""I told ya so!"" every day ends. let vacation, without PPE choose, experience pandemic firsthand. Thank you, consider suggestion. I'm European...lmao problem lies squarely top leadership. acted quickly responsibly, talent bringing people together rather tearing apart, gotten out-of-control predicament. first virus outbreak we've contained last 12 years. Free public health be. Hopefully someday HPV Shingles vaccines follow suit. ""general strike"" heard right now? People need understand collective bargaining works lol, especially national scale. can't general strike like 0.0001% workers participate That's depression then. AZ minimal amounts COVID guidelines followed crowds every single nook cranny. take risk every time leave home Look Oxfords vaccine passed safety trials ages ago, supposed become first MERS vaccine, promising results far. Hopefully March 2021 we‚Äôre done bullshit Yeah public option everyone else working ages 20-65? That's missing one. Yes seems real memories past months. remember snips there, mostly somehow April May, still think happened recently months. I've heard things decades, TPTB certainly taking time. far strip club vs. porn - physical touch thing. people ""touch starved"" especially pandemic.  


Not DEFENDING it, still dumb-shit decision, I'm betting mix lonely touch-starved folks, ""It's hoax!"" folks, ""I want feel normal again!"" folks. You‚Äôre talking something totally different. 

Herd immunity aspect virus way spreads, type regulations. Right trying enact universal healthcare decades. horrible ok them. FFS bill Clinton president Hillary wrote universal healthcare bill defeated Congress. suspect another uninformed unlikely voter know anything Twitter feed. flu season coming around? Hospitalization generally occurs weeks infection - people infected time? 

It circulating community somehow connection people coming countries. Way exaggerate Right now? Find something actually pulled threatens interests. example, convince threat re-election.

Long term? Organize movement spend next decade union organizing blitz. massively successful, might position makes sense think organizing general strike. 

This problem. Change always something achieved immediately. often takes years decades sustained work. urgent care Disney World fucking screwed. AMA wanna get super angry/depressed. lot boomers recently retired upset people caring health ""ruining"" retirement. worry economy, want able go cruises. pandemic demonstrated painfully fragile global supply chains are. Also article: ‚Äú‚ÄúWhen ask Thanksgiving‚Äôs going like, think it‚Äôs dependent American people choose respond,‚Äù Dr. Redfield said. people follow CDC‚Äôs social distancing hygiene recommendations get flu shots, ‚Äúit bring [COVID-19] outbreak down,‚Äù said.‚Äù 

So basically could worst fall ever best fall ever. ¬†To get (underage) boy's hole. Mask Venti-LATER! realtive surge worth. 937 diagnosis day entire country. really wish rather USA long ago Texas like 2,000, thought myself, state 29M people, that's actually terrible. #spoketoosoon kind cross reactive T-cell immunity prevent infection spread virus.

If T-cell immunity neutralizing antibodies, good disease severity likely less, T-cells keep viral load long enough neutralizing antibodies form unlikely severe disease.

But still get sick, around people immunocompromised (and may able get vaccinated) spread them. since ""we live society"" assume around people day day basis. I've worked people immunocompromised they're sick elderly. People work probably immunocompromised since talk it, even know.

For reason, good enough, need vaccinations, booster shots, neutralizing antibodies keep virus away people. many people die.

Too late. would guessed people supported Trump. relief!! I‚Äôm arguing anything, stated we‚Äôve never one personally don‚Äôt think count one. would best acted like it‚Äôs going happen get back kind normal faster. That‚Äôs many strains flu antibodies strain won‚Äôt work others.The guess prevalent every year include vaccine. Obviously won‚Äôt work people infected strains included.

The Coronavirus hasn‚Äôt mutated way. Vaccines targeting spike protein work known strains virus. Wow whole 3 months 

Cue people get deliberately go crazy three months afterwards. sure masks slow reduce spread Covid-19. virus real. 123! We'd already much, much closer normalcy (or least, something drive everyone mad destroy economy) could everyone wear mask social distance reasonable. alone would get us much, much better place we're now. can't get done, thus suffer. good point! Honestly cancer congress itself. Incumbents leave, fresh blood comes in, get sucked current state things. gotten way hand, fear going back. never one party solution congress, never refresh large enough rid social cancer pervades it. 

It really matter ""who started it"" anymore point. systemic problem going drastic action fix. think perfect storm ineptitude gotten us point can't backtrack basically double there's way them... cost getting worse unfortunately. 

The lack top leadership start turned situation powderkeg.

All neighbors think hoax. ever proven eyes (how short trump coming saying look... hoax) cognitive dissonance rattle entrenched position filtered way politicians. They're bed Trump can't get out. relatively conservative recognize people. Spineless... convictions... integrity all. media divided hard see changing. Everything's conspiracy theory days... tell flat earther world round way they're going believe it? feel like futile point Fox news pounded people ground like stakes disheartening think amount effort would take pull out.

This happens absolute lack top-down leadership. comes back this. majority Washoe County Commissioners republicans. Washoe County responsible small portion Tahoe. Well, bad news you. Sorry  Curious post pulled yet. don‚Äôt usually need refrigerated trucks morgues they? think small loan 1 million would enough today's world. Heck, barely start McD franchise that. general strike realistic, economic one is. nation decide purchase necessities minimalize lifestyles awhile, could strike really hurts. pockets! striving for. Lol fear might broken mind. Simply saying wont make true. know cold hard truth grim thats world works. Ch*na says 80k pneumonia deaths every year everyone looks otherway laugh face. uncomfortable never know much disease affected much world think also another tragedy. 

Scientist, health care institutes actual medical studies (and fefes) agree matter many times repeat thing wont become reality. big reporting covid deaths going countries. Whether intentional debate.

Comprehensive post-coronavirus evaluation? 
I hope okay.  
  
Here said symptoms back June:

Speak buddy Time online classess. would almost 20% school. Seems unlikely. ND quarentine protocols, contact tracing, etc. students decided go campus party positives that, allegedly. see ND response well protocols work. That's real question. Everyone knew little outbreaks would happen. matters respond them. Branch Covidians cheer wildly! It‚Äôs going get worse real though. First all, shoving children back schools going disastrous. schools open couple weeks we‚Äôre seeing closings ‚Äúdeep cleanings‚Äù positive tests, quarantines 1000 students due exposure potential exposure. That‚Äôs going get better schools open next weeks. 

We‚Äôve got college kids going back session they‚Äôll bars house parties numbers Covid. 

And we‚Äôll flu cases top Covid cases, taking even hospital beds. 

There really ‚Äúworse‚Äù factor that‚Äôs going make fall winter worse spring summer been. always good feeling when.Anus_Fungi side. Actually NZ mass testing population. conducted 105,000 tests per million, extremely high country cases us. random community testing healthy country well, assure undetected community spread. 

Our highest testing numbers first wave, late June border scare showed zero positive results well. 

Within two days first person testing positive week two people hospitalised Covid. chances made 102 days community without single person even needing see doctor it, never mind getting hospitalised, extremely low. crazy thing people DRIVE away wind need paraglider, much cheaper car. anyone Florida data analysis?

Well somebody fudge numbers work out. covid going end 2021 feels like eternity considering things felt past months (though tbh mental health issues lots stupid/weird/downright embarrassing problems this,) refuse take even single unnecessary risk infecting anyone else-if can't make long, that's want take anyone else me. would assume lot people working question ancillary consequences disease recovery.

Even worst administration would interested know significant long term disabilities would impose serious societal costs economic damage lost productivity. always expression confident scorn. News flash. There's already 200k deaths average year. includes fact people driving, going out, sorts random things kill people every day. 

The reality probably like 250k deaths covid-related already. flu patients

Would argument stronger took things out? saying? fewer things?

You obviously lost discussion. Thaw pathetic person are. fucking time. Six months later, literally excuse PPE test supply scarcity. None.

Sheer rationality lacking you. Yeah, ended months ago.


It's almost like deniers denial.


For months pretty much, wear mask avoid large groups people American, honestly get COVID deal consequences. really care keeping family safe. long we‚Äôre vaccinated therefore reasonably safe, crisis over. someone dies couldn‚Äôt absolute bare minimum keep safe, won‚Äôt catch weeping funeral. said back March last thing return international travel, international travel would potential fuck progress Europe COVID. surprise, are.

Especially considering coronavirus would outside meat exposed hottest temp. 

Now cooked chicken served handled someone virus gets food cooked, may way could transmitted. evidence suggests otherwise. Yeah. think testing one two dose variants (or did) general conclusions two dose produced stronger immune result. Exactly following advice experts,

But aware this, must specific reason pointing Quran Bible. believe Quran inherently violent Bible? believe dna people read Quran naturally makes inclined violence? end argument focusing Quran rather living conditions impact religious community?

Hopefully ""team 5 million"" return 2 3 weeks. think depends live. live, kids go trick treating local mall. 2000 kids, plus parents, small (for mall) space event lasts 3 hours.

However, ever since announced shit earlier year, I'm pretty sure I'd even make Mr. Clean proud. did, didn't. state said exempt commanders soldiers quarantine. stop wanted break rules. bad apples make look bad!

The commanders come yesterday finally release numbers publicly though. 204 cases military residents, new incoming personnel. makes 7% cases state.

For amount military personnel families state, that's really quite low. Woah imagination materialized! NYC here. Spent better part Spring indoors. I‚Äôm sorry, ‚Äúcold store‚Äù? I‚Äôm familiar that.

170,000 people die - *but economy?*  said im angry? Youre one saying youd gladly go school pandemic people charge wont right thing, instead trying something right wrong.

If every teacher left, school would close. simply wouldnt enough people run school

Simple question you. Yes no, would go volunteer school pandemic Yes.... responsible new flu,hid four months, killed 800 worldwide learned nothing because...

Years later, exact way, another flu emerged. happened Kansas, hid killed 750,000 people.

Kansas change much busy blaming New York, California Massachusetts even though backwards policies lead happening twice...

Then sure.... Ban Kansas sanction took responsibility mass murder.

And no... care easily hurt feelings Kansans.

Glad asked though.

But Kansas backwards causer diseases fun hypothetical situation. hear easier revolt countries laughably lax firearms restrictions... wrong, went restaurant measured 34 degrees Celsius temperature... I‚Äôm pretty sure would dead Sweet Potato Hitler I'm atheist religious...

Haha okay then, settle down

And yes, lack facilities big contributor lockdowns, thanks time 9/11 cakewalk compared this. incomparable. look back it, response atrocious wrongs... touch frozen fruit. Food factories corona nightmare. different food going cook frozen fruit different.

I used work frozen food factory really cold. Runny noses dripping onto food uncommon occurance. act shocked ask figured out. Ask tell anyone figured since lot poor people Clinton paying post making public ruin kill jobs Dude responded already. Go place unwarranted anger someone else. WON‚ÄôT this. Duh. want teachers go won‚Äôt go themselves. teachers quit tell gotta go way hell that. Jesus. whole year one huge mental health crisis almost everyone planet, definitely countries strong leadership guide it. 

Everyone copes trauma differently, I've noticed people normally shit together responding reality expected way.. hopelessness, depression, caution, normal reactions face something serious life-altering. 

Violent anger, willingness harm others refusal face reality speak much deeper psychological issues likely present pandemic. think makes shitty person, think that's focusing control right now. That's mentality whole time, grounding occasionally anxiety spiral hits. 80% infected don‚Äôt transmit virus, according study. highly trusted corporation Maybe look months, right done little testing. never know could cause even people die something less aggressive. point, vaccine equally dangerous virus. time tell grabbed sooner. even turns perfect, mad decided wait ensure injecting people legal dose something untested. disgusting Idk feel like it‚Äôs likely never actually gone population like thought. It‚Äôs probably much widespread thought people extreme symptoms matter see not? sure hell feel it. guess best treat handing n95 masks Maybe scares people stay fuck home feel good. reckon one decides act upper hand. using example long term viral infections. lies dormant go away. plenty examples COVID patients staying positive months. least one early paper demonstrating changes brain MRI. also post COVID chronic fatigue like illness recognized. think everyone catches virus completely clear ongoing immunity issues wishful thinking. They‚Äôve done genome testing suggests it‚Äôs new strain, something evolved earlier community cases happened 14 day quarantine? apply military personnel? won.... cost? write like brain turned mush. Yeah things heat lamps, attic fans, swamp coolers. like people forget existed central air heat. 500,000 people earning money two weeks pumping less money economy cost effective tests? think need one test day either. Godam cheap $4 Chicken Fingers laced COVID I'm telling you. yeah, and? go volunteer school, around hundreds kids adults, help spread virus. simple that. safe way go back school. option stay home. teachers continue teaching home. proper sentence can‚Äôt formed, ignore move on. people still complaining putting fabric face severe anxiety regular panic attacks pandemic US really takes toll me. It‚Äôs hard hope government nothing help country. Donald Trump cares nobody.

He evil incarnate. ""If really believed opinions shitty, hide behind anonymity"" -anonymous poster Nice ... Love see sanity here. long ago sub would've called murderer daring leave house. Ya. Definitely. Shutdown killing people. Open back fewer deaths. I've given trying think it, much process really. I've resigned it'll whatever going  basically problem solved? lol youre right. wanna risk healthy staying home kill bunch people irresponsibly kids go school face face. I'd 100% never allow kids go back school situation. id yank em right public school enroll online learning program. avoiding obvious question. Fauci mainstream scientific community, radical, he's wrong, they're wrong.

But let posit Fauci dirty horrible awful liar, suggest, sake argument let's agree thus ignored.

**So**, Fauci banished, think better qualified, honest trusted comes Covid issues USA? listen? ""Not good thing"" what? think anyone cares point ""good thing"" not? new virus people's behavior towards it? no, requiring parents actively participate kids life bad thing. Virus, can't spread petri dish.

It needs infect cell start replicating. would possible need go larinx grow, eyes too. That's sur spread surface. would that? I'm pro mask would never call police report maskless people. people spam system. Police see people without masks patrols like anyway. course safe, made 120 proof Russian Vodka. 24% trust would recommend public use . really think okay ? live Barcelona, I'm sorry, go city like Barcelona PANDEMIC moron. go vacation, go somewhere remote. 

Don't travel 5 million people city people literally unable social distance due population density, dodge crowds buy groceries. country middle civil war? No? Shut fuck then. Killing enemy important thing, kill kills you. Two days Trump declared health emergency (in January), congressional democrats brought bunch experts congress testify overreacting risk covid spreading US significant enough warrant drastic measures.

The US front curve point, democrats torpedoed instantly. 

Trump, true Woodrow Wilson style, went topical petulant fallback doubled non cooperation... reality politicization came left instantly. Imagine could different parade bunch scientists congress discredit Presidents health emergency. Imagine brought scientists enhance expand measures instead shit them. 

FWIW next day Vietnam took actions (declared equivalent health emergency shut travel China except people returning home, trade). much better outcome somehow.

New Zealand also took similar steps without party power undermining managed great response.

The US political climate 2019 2020 ""the side right"" mentality caused tremendous fuckup. Even people refuse believe White House took steps protect country. similar situation regards close relatives . well educated loving people gone fucking insane . really believe attack republicans, trump Christianity . longer even talk anything weather . post Facebook friends Georgia hype . frustrating Plus nation going all-in Islamophobia generally stigmatizing anyone slightly darker complexion.

But sure...pulled together. There's going outbreak Russian doctors falling windows, soon. become common thing within parent community work within, support remote learning. 

5K per month benefits support pod 4-6 students person going rate seems. hiring school's usual sub pool (who needs sub remote?), hiring para-professionals, reading specialists, etc. people fell cracks know trade well enough help remote learning.

110K health care year contract well I've seen... I'm California everything expensive. ‚ÄúOf 3,000 study participants, 52% answered negatively. 24.5% agreed vaccinated.

Asked reasons distrust vaccine, announced week President Vladimir Putin, 66% respondents said insufficient data effectiveness. 48% concerned fact possible create vaccine short time.

20% respondents said would recommend vaccination patients, colleagues acquaintances.‚Äù Halloween state mind. üéÉ traditional parties sure hope way disaster then. Overtook World War 1 good ago. WW1 deaths 116 thousand. US Covid deaths 170 thousand. Hardly like isn‚Äôt already constant media though Putin beast, I‚Äôm trusting shut comes Russia. I‚Äôd love leadership US.

Best wishes another success story. become biggest scientific joke 21st century. obviously never solve poverty talk race 99% time. 


Try talking race 100% time see solves poverty. /s said similar UK Australia. Try telling auckland there's risk ü§® Yes. Nobody talks government shutdown anymore. that?

Edit: humans short memories. Good thing came writing, even society tend forget stuff easily, unless lores repeat continuously
Even ww1 remembered movies. Without movies would living memory ww1  They‚Äôre going learn human trials exist hard way. data covers one type mask admitted masks consistent design. conclusions based faulty assumption. wish money buy bunch routers rename leave places. appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* seems like every day there's new story brits fucking numbers... friend got covid april. rough 2 weeks home never fully recovered. Afterwards suffered tiredness body aches. getting sick again! High fever, shortness breath, body aches. still waiting test results come back. worry family. sucks. India actually passed England‚Äôs old death toll. England lopped 5,000 deaths officially India passed week ago searched searched, can't find article read. tons info there, able find source explains simply.
 
Basically, since leading vaccine candidates live attenuated type, risk giving young/old/immunocompromised people. I'm certainly asking take word it, Google around little, I'm sure come conclusion - front-running covid-19 vaccines safe people, though people, efficiency may lower. 52% chunk russian doctors get near balconies along hospital shifts.  Bc side bad  caused 9/11 Holy shit yes. last go cavity gave three shots still felt it. last option going shot palate. opted grip seat tight hurried. amazed managed it. that‚Äôs pain threshold part kicking in. say 80% population infected. said 50-80% infected asymptomatic. 

If 100 people population 2 symptoms test positive, count 2-8 infected people symptoms. South Korea? downplays infection risk

It must infection risk then. Bullshit news fed truckload. good!!! French teacher high school least month sick. happening. also years ago. can't imagine Covid would her. sick week cold once. Unfortunately you, China much spare test capacity (nearly 5 million PCR test per day) gaps easily close throwing test capacity problem. concerning black Americans polled 25% said would get covid vaccine.

We could honestly looking scenario safe effective vaccine that's free Americans inner cities might dealing years lack vaccinations. Umm relatively speaking..still Mexico lol  Respect brother, nice see island sanity sea hysteria
I wish best luck endeavour really beneficial! Well, could pay stay home *not* kill Afghani civilians couple months.

Or OK piss away billions dollars results dead Afghanis? LPT: wash hands handling raw meat. Groundbreaking stuff,  wow, want already known 6 months ago? shit Sherlock. Yeah us. Even though several vaccines require two doses, US purchased think 600 million doses option 500 million more.

Churchill allegedly said: *‚ÄúAmericans always trusted right thing, possibilities exhausted.‚Äù* Sounds delicious. ridiculous part Kemp said local school districts say whether open schools state didn‚Äôt say matter. municipality wanted put mask mandate in, state wouldn‚Äôt allow it. Unbelievable  Well fine people, invest media campaigns, on. Yeah also throw huge party every year I'm absolutely devastated going happen year. decided back May absolutely worth it.

I'm still going decorate porch probably put little bags treats table kids still get candy direct interaction! figure bags keep digging around bowl. I'll probably put hand sanitizer bottle too.

That's scary thought!

You can‚Äôt use confirmed case number try formula everyone admits it‚Äôs missing tens millions cases.

And 2 isn‚Äôt acceptable That's kind good point, comparing PANDEMICS (not viruses themselves, human consequences), think apples apples comparison influenza 1918 v. Covid 2020. That's plan. year ignoring party. I'll even ignoring platform. voting clean house, top bottom. matter are. office now, I'm voting guy. Quote:

""Police said guards park chased couple, got away.""


I politically correct image security guards trying run ...


Maybe gun violence US people get tired running 5 steps... still expecting reading comment mention potentially excluded tourism bubbles appear. Trump issued 4 executive orders Saturday, two extended eviction forgiveness end year extending unemployment 400 week Senate agrees something else..

The two student loan forgiveness till end year they're suspending Medicare social security taxes end year people still working slightly larger paycheck.

Also Pelosi Mniucin still negotiating deal every day. big thing holding much money give states give money USPS. reach agreement Senate 24 hours return Washington vote it. Whats sad Americans put 2 2 together realise money that's held them.

All Americans pay taxes, yet todays day age everyone's distracted ask goes.

It used lile this.

They're winning, fucking revolution needs take place again. Probably lot data handle. I'd say sounds right. I've seen pay less work. complaining ""free loaders""

You'll never guess gave billionaires already much money.... ""The school district suspended two students last week, including 15-year-old Hannah Watters admitted posting photo online. many criticized school attempting silence students safety issues North Paulding High School, suspensions lifted Friday.""

Gotta love silencing techniques. going bother showing another study understand cannot get abstract study referring to.

Go ahead reread study understand about, try again.

Pay special attention lines like Furthermore, performance valved N95 mask likely affected exhalation valve, opens strong outwards airflow. valve compromise protection wearer, decrease protection persons surrounding wearer. comparison, ***the performance fitted, non-valved N95 mask far superior.***

And makes unfeasible directly measure size small (aerosol) droplets setup.

And take even further, go ahead identify valved n95 mask tested, [this picture masks thing tested pictures raw material sample.

Also pay special attention Again, want note mask tests performed (one speaker masks four speakers selected masks) serve ***only demonstration.***

Remember, one brought study up. read it, understand it? say claim does. nah, protests happen they're black lives  things like Holocaust denial begin.

This entire thread fucking ludicrous. China told us can't trusted! /r/noahgettheboat  Sweden never wore masks. Lowest mask usage entire planet. Yes social development huge deal growing human. union highest dues Canada, pay nearly 6k year.
Because that, make $6/hour non union, better benefits career training certifications covered.

6k saves 1-2k raises pay 30k year.

TOTALLY worth it. depends restaurant kind food, price range, service. one worked, recently, break even food sales alone. Without liquor sales, make money; can't to-go. There's also issues labor, need many people on-site make to-go orders, wait staff make enough get without tips in-person gives, on.  
  
It's also problem to-go orders expensive produce restaurant; container seem like much, ordering 4 cases to-go containers every week instead single case every week start adding cost food. also many orders to-go orders, either...people stay late, meet friends stay drinks, big parties events, catering business anyway, on. to-go orders May, example, would expected rushes erratic 100 orders Monday night used average 50, Friday pushing 250-300 orders Covid might get 75.  
  
tl;dr: There's lot variables involved, part nobody making much anything all. mitch turtle actively pushing legislature place kids wear mask attend school can't turn around sue dumbasses negligence trouble remembering breakfast trying remember two weeks ago probably infected fuck get this? Maybe herd immunity 2020 without vaccine agree on. herd immunity without vaccine mammals beaten back viruses since forever. agree based infection numbers. I‚Äôm trying say bet infection rates far higher reported. hypothesis all, could wrong. give hypothesis quick second, jeez. Best way explained GOP says don‚Äôt care you, don‚Äôt care you, Democratic Party claim do, proceed act show don‚Äôt  doctors saw virtually suggested experiencing anxiety, psychosomatic illness, maybe allergies. shitty thermometers then? easily get decent IR thermometers accurate within 0.2 K. calibrate properly that's hard either. No, mopped floors polished nobs options, dont want use them. 

the schools need closed. schools dont want that, get funding per head per day attendance. ton expenses pay run school. schools dont re-open system break down. possibly good. 

smart parents home schooling able, also online school, isnt city school district. really triggering school system, compete nationally available programs dont worry running brick mortar school. 

bottom line schools need stay closed covid cases back literally zero area. sad school boards willing risk childrens lives money keep status quo. hope school ass sued oblivion.

Yes heard that. 

Another interesting tidbit similar. 

Some researchers think SARS-CoV-2 circulating years (at least year), took time score right genetic mutation climate infect kill masses. evidence COVID RNA found Europe early 2019 wastewater. 

This would also make sense human optimized ACE2 receptors genetic mutation usually seen virus circulating least several months. 

They also finding people never infected seem strong tcell responses virus, perhaps greater cross protection coronaviruses would cause. they're wondering people exposed built immunity, cross protection could explain certain people seem near immune it, others die week. could also *maybe* explain cities like NYC, Stockholm, etc... seem drop certain infection point. may closer level herd immunity think due factors discussed many others (blood type, vitamin D, vaccinations, etc...).

Lastly, research suggests OC43 one coronaviruses causes common cold caused severe disease outbreaks back passed cows humans. similar we're experiencing now, less contagious, smaller scale. could good news though, novel coronaviruses cause bad disease first exposure, lends theory acquired immunity, vaccination, mutation, factors SARS-CoV-2 eventually like bad cold. 

While new coronavirus may come along time, since mutate quickly influenza viruses, probably see something similar H1N1 situation. However something new family arrives, hopefully COVID vaccination acquired immunity give us cross protection. say almost, think may short changing necessary. UK standing 5-8%, herd immunity R0=3 disease like Covid 75%, means we're 1/10 way there. Even Sweden(?), zero policy, 10%.

If acts like human coronaviruses, lose natural immunity (or substantially reduced) 6 months 3 years.

The math, then, looks like (without substantial distancing) 8% pop 6 months, 4 years 70% (with transmission slowing increase resistant population), year 3 16% got beginning susceptible again.

If sounds odd shouldn't. is, literally, 3 forms coronavirus make 20% ""common cold"" cases circle globe again.  agree CP, get 500k knowing USA 3 times population 1918 lost 650K , 3 times would roughly 1.8M people today. advances medical care way lose many.

That way get better idea states doing. suppressing virus, way doesn‚Äôt kill people causes. look Georgia‚Äôs covid-19 death count, seems like disaster, look total deaths though, deaths peaked 18.7-26.7 percent normal range. National average 36-41 percent. longer goes less people involved, would think hardest part staying healthy opening couple weeks.

I one doubters gladly eating Crow.  Science articles reinfection? I'm even surprised. fully expected this. agree 51 million k-12 public school kids country stand outside without supplies absurd face

Sure, standing outside without supplies would absurd face. course situation. School outdoors would work lot country lot year.

But that's point, really. point necessary *something*, try *something*, 51 million kids, many without masks, sitting hours enclosed classrooms, many without windows open, far absurd. 

So... choices? Virtual education. 

Getting creative get outside. 

Collective behavioral changes drop level virus community

Investing adequate ventilation filtration classrooms

or... magical thinking. pointing oversimplifying examples Argentina India. failed curb spread lockdown measures didnt account specifically vulnerable groups (the poor) among many cultural norms lead spread (or example, Indians high population density areas returning home small villages spreading disease there, existing poor conditions slums, etc). 

I never said lockdowns 100% effective magical silver bullet stop Covid tracks, insenuated that. 

My whole point lockdowns effective Northeast, mainly people northeast good job complying social distancing measures, mask mandates, local governments slow reopen. key part, reopening soon reopening stages, open one stage, wait weeks ensure cases dont spike continuing ti next stage reopening, repeat. evidence points ""herd immunity"". go back examples, havent India Argentina seen herd immunity curb Covid cases yet? Europe northeast US? Also, convenient left New Zealand whole conversation, arguably effective lockdown measures world. 

Also, never said lockdowns end all. Korea SE Asian countries showed widespread rapid testing contract tracing (and masks) highly effective. US spent 2 3 months prepare ramping programs instead blatantly ignoring thousands Americans ground, may ever needed kind lockdown small localized ones. 

I agree schools open, can't due ineffective leadership lack national response country gotten us point cases still increasing half country. inept downright shameful response pandemic reason forced cancel fall sports school likely go another months-long shut fall winter over. lockdowns dont tovcost people's educations livelihoods. country enough wealth resources provide every student internet computer access online learning. enough wealth resources institute debt freezes temporary universal basic income, universal healthcare. things necessary make sure every American get sustained lockdown. leaders refuse it. refuse tax rich, provide oversight ensure large corporations dont steal relief funds meant small businesses. tax rich far decrease spending military police budgets. ability assholes office sides spectrum refuse it. 

So, actually coherent, effective, unified national response, yes, schools would opening now. hindsight open, listened fucking experts get-go, never eliminated federal pandemic response team resources place, communicated seriousness American people beginning, instead leaders downplayed encouraged disinformation undermined credibility scientists minds average citizens led shit show living now. live Alabama we're fine. People wearing masks numbers gone near 2,000 per day well 1,000. comparison states around us like Florida Mississippi, we're pretty well. This. Lots people generally pro-vaccine, suspicious specific one unusual circumstances around it‚Äôs development. We‚Äôve already seen politics money push untested treatments without sufficient scientific evidence (see: hydroxychloroquine). problem make many sacrifices long enemy cant see. Oh, bad recession starts actually hurt Americans ability consume. lot people forget average income actually rose economy bottomed checks.

Again, Ill state main point original comment. Typically mutations less deadly. Well sure, inert, dead, destroyed, take pick hehe.

Im lay person =p Thats true, I‚Äôm trying take extra precaution People Southeast USA, hurricane season. June 1 November 30( think) . called cyclone side world.

Critical thinking axed nearly every curriculum, seeing results that. 

We laugh joke snarky stupid us Americans deliberate act ensure republican votes. 

They even shy admitting sometimes anymore. Divided States America Gates Fauci saying thing, probably saying effective way encourage continued public precautions. saying vaccine likely coming soon (they def. know Fall small % early 2021 others), tempering expectations effectiveness vaccine (e.g., maybe 50% effective, first round require multiple doses), giving end 2021 reasonable target entire thing gone America (i.e., everyone, even plurality anti-vaxxers safe). 

I'm sure messaging really effective though. definitely CYAs Gates Fauci, probably weakens current best public health defenses. People largely willing wear masks social distance expectation solution soon. hear ""end 2021,"" likely say ""fuck it, I'm going back normal life."" Fauci Gates saying ""we fighting hard get vaccine next months, progress promising, hold bit longer"" later ""oh shit, distribution optimal,"" ""or shit, first vaccine needs boosters often thought.' Then, incremental roll tolerable population result durable precautions easier hope short-term successes. That‚Äôs going work. proof long term immunity yet. Yes, posted higher up.

But understanding thought process decision making process important. used work schools area right lot nervous teachers staff. According CDC like ratio .008 infections fatalities. Check school district even specific school parents' group Facebook. 90% parents complaining every thing school's Covid get connected people school possibly specific grade.

My work requires temp check starting shift. 99.9. gotta go get tested. Test results written take 10-12 days.

Can't work period.

How many colds people going end small fever? many people gonna flu 3 days nope still wait rona test come back.

Meanwhile we'll stuck without work 2 weeks...if even tests day go.

So I'll without money 2 weeks. work without 2 weeks. 

Theres many employees lose...only many people work.. I'm working lol that's useful. got money start business, cant start know what's going COVID. think replying wrong person, defcatlord answer.

And considering already knew happens, every vaccine relying booster shots, headline basically clickbait. Trump defeating us, covid. active propaganda Russia, China, Iran helping self destruction. us locked weeks. March April.. decided ignore medical professionals, eased restriction had. Listened deniers, pretended like weak flu went beach. tell people wear masks. groups protesting local government suggested masks, suggesting made anti-maskers lose shit.

But yes, you‚Äôre right: one theory based finding asymptomatic people particular study detritus, also think study found vaccines completely unrelated illnesses like bacterial pneumonia others ***might*** factor. fair would make sense quarantine traveling US anywhere else. Well, is. However, economist noted Finland's GDP decline severe many European countries.

Finland's working-day adjusted GDP plunged 4.9 percent year-on-year second quarter, according preliminary figures Statistics Finland.

The number-crunching agency also reported employment figures period, April-June, expected contract around 3.2 percent, year-on-year.

Timo Hirvonen, chief economist Handelsbanken, attributed Q2's output decline decrease exports well weak development services sector. economist said data showed signs economic recovery began toward end second quarter, June.

While working-day adjusted GDP dropped 4.9 percent second quarter, seasonally-adjusted output rose June 0.9 percent, compared previous month.

Hirvonen noted decline seen Finland's GDP last quarter clearly less drop seen many European countries, including neighbouring Sweden. According Swedish statistics agency, SCB, Scandinavian country's GDP dropped 8.6 percent Q2.

Hirvonen said exports play major role shaping Finland's economy towards end year. growing concerns global demand could stagnate second wave coronavirus epidemic occurs. Meanwhile, said difficulties facing Finnish exports rise.

""The long lead times industrial order deliveries kept decline Finnish industrial production less countries year,"" said, adding order backlog would support recoveries industry exports remainder year, despite decline new orders year.

How supposed cope shit? Really.

That makes sound like it'd still show serology test. shit Wasting time defending orange shit stain internet real insane thing chief. They've already expired.

(See: Exaggerated risk transmission COVID-19 fomites, even virus survived frozen food, nobody put forward evidence suggesting infection thereafter occur frozen food surface.

The far likelier scenario transmission occurring NZ slow steady pace, hit cluster folks experience symptoms. [50% experience symptoms. Emerging research shows children excellent asymptomatic carriers vectors, 

It's easy see chain people NZ, ""opened back up"" quite time, [hadn't required face passing quietly slowly population 100 days hit group folks experienced symptoms upon COVID-19 infection. 

And indeed makes sense know [US meat processing cold food warehouses excellent place person-to-person transmission occur. first symptomatic person chain, coincidentally worked place dealt cold food. Surprise surprise.

The way find test co-workers first symptomatic person came contact first active infection via antibody (assuming accurate test available) prior infection.

Until peer reviewed evidence suggesting frozen food transmission (it explored), likelier evidence-supported scenarios explored first. daily testing available people actually important him. things life, little bit everything contributing larger whole. bad made mistakes. context matters.

The advantage US giving zero fucks probably going horrifying winter wave virus find equilibrium. won‚Äôt enough uninfected people left holidays rapidly spread. Ha! state epidemiologist removed position contract tracers insisted hired plenty. public told would need around 300 even try get handle it. Turns out, 15. 
So no, contact tracing working tourists coming flaunting breaking rules. lot tickets decent amount arrests. 3k coming every day overwhelming, Quarantine rules county police jurisdiction. takes special investigators state AG enforce.

Sheesh! one thing I'll say I'm ok keep mask laws place forever. see huge cost wearing mask. Lots things (social distancing, restaurants, etc) come back economy, workforce, etc. mask laws/normalization? take public transit work every day, pandemic, ALWAYS motherfucker hacking away train, everyone giving dirty looks. worst part is, sometimes motherfucker me! would much comfortable everyone wore mask train, I'm sick, anyone else is. perhaps it‚Äôs attitude leaves Sweden much fewer unexplained excess deaths almost every country. assumption. Though it‚Äôs still slight concern people keep failing recognize seriousness virus. downvotes, presume aren‚Äôt reading full statement taking concern without context presented it. think they're talking mandatory quarantining, China style, incarcerate covid wards special camps. referring basically kind closed border/trade policy small nations like NZ might resort covid find way in. Remade ""2012"" ?..2020 version... Honestly going turn chicken COVID slaughtered. 

And everyone panic. 

ETA 2 months best. pretty sure someone help understand would expecting bad flu season?

Think Native Americans new world.

Isolation communities makes disease endemic community. cold circulates house immune carrying it. get together Thanksgiving boom, everyone spread awful germs. 1+

Around I‚Äôm at, one, shall say 4-8 people around heavily packed shops/street wears masks. trust me, everyone travels groups 3 around here. worse things death, friend. yeah gets colder fear shit rise up. Consider America formed democracy, rather Constitutionally limited Republic, put context.

The really important part ""Constitutionally limited"" bit... Same. like ‚Äúthat‚Äôs fuckin dark coming CDC‚Äù Yeah do. ignorant stupid. little late. China shady whole thing best. covering initial outbreaks whistleblowers etc.. recent actions Hong Kong. 

China already vaccinated military personnel, began weeks ago. there‚Äôs anything already knew confirmed China friend. October. Vote early possible. never know you‚Äôll laying hospital Election Day. right now, school plans riddled ifs going work. 

... god help us all. live full lockdown even able go outside run 5 months? heard anywhere long-lasting draconian lockdown. son born February. feel you.

Your risk analysis entirely own, encourage really think risks seeing family. guidelines gatherings people, socially distance, can't, wear mask. likely safe see family long they've safe themselves, even not, outside visits family wear mask.

My wife see family friends 3 months. awful, especially first-time parents full time jobs. made decision risk worthwhile happier. Mental health important, pales comparison risks COVID-19 (IMO). Keep up! mean... down! cases! thinking same, probably facing teacher shortage, ergo, ""never mind quarantine thing, come work, it'll probably fine!"" meh, fuck assholes Yeah gonna worst Fall....Flu, Covid, Elections (no telling turn yet) holidays.....No kidding. worst ever. *great* far sight better labeled worst state country Corona.

Yeah...but we've hearing hospitals ""almost full"" ""close overwhelmed"" month never happens. seem different. anyone gotten point hair starts grow **back**? long it?

(Had early April, hair's falling past 2 months. Starting look real sparse top...)  November, sure. make January. got right! Video deleted??  Locking till vaccine never supposed case realistic option. There‚Äôs point need reach live virus, waiting 5 years long term vaccine side effects studied point everyone take id realistic. Good question. China? whole year long long episode Black Mirror extended Onion article. mkes feel better, average respons rate around 10% (all responses, including immediate rejections) interview rate around 1%. send 100 resumes, expect hear back 10, get interviewed one, probably get job.

Hang there! afraid take part time work make ends meet look something permanent. really different trip grocery. getting rid defacto dictators isnt worth trip store...

You also bring board elections county. Run in, run out. Hrm, Florida count one positive, imagine they'd count first positive case.

In case dumb thoughts went: $$$$$$$$$$$$ don‚Äôt believe people continue restrictions, way humans accept another summer like this. (I know US gives 0 fucks I‚Äôm talking rest world too) Vote help change sooner.

I would give anything national call action (people, business, schools) organize hit head on, lead federal level. Per capita... California 29th 50 states cases per million people. forced buy shit system isn‚Äôt solution. It‚Äôs band aid helped people propping original problem.

Thanks understanding! Yeah conspiracy theorists family unfortunately. absolutely getting flu shot out! holy shit never even thought getting time. would deaths sentence sure Shit x2 saying no, logical response issue kids vectors. 
 
You might missed suppose. logical response risks/rewards consider outside virus. you, virus seems matters. others, factors consider.
 
Anyone getting virus problematic, that's issue. issue degree negatively affect rest life (and lives others) neglecting serious issues longer term effects?
 
Your answer would simply ignore anything COVID-19 and, opinion, foolish way think it. insult injury: Georgia first state seatbelt laws. local police quick pull $15 ticket, too. Bike Cops enjoy summers cruising around, finding nice shady hiding spot, eagle eye seatbelts running redlights. Allegedly, kid sneezed hallway school yesterday. sent kid around home. First day school. makes people feel ""safe"". people feel safe, they'll spend tons money :/ Sure: brand new virus. Comparing influenza (which people still doing!) silly.

Nobody knew data isn‚Äôt yet. Sorry even speed? begin with, stuff done aint government like vaccine development. Private businesses ones engaging em trump friends steal credit. took Corona realize this. I'm Marine Corps vet refuse stay country. LA county larger population 41 states.  Essential BS. going end badly. One school already least 35 positive cases since opening. Yeah, 3 young kids love Halloween, going different year sure. It'll first time take trick treating. We'll think something fun home, still dress candy. sucks, we've home 5 months they're used it. Hopefully one Halloween affected, next year better. I'm high risk group. Living rural county everyone thinks covid city hoax. cheerfully stand line first dose, everyone within 100 miles actively trying infect covid. 

Guess party registered vote year. appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* yet time health officials still feels reopening schools good move ahead......strange.  Sacrifice quarter children LINE Science deniers like screwed.

There plenty evidence masks help slow stop spread virus.

Just wear damn mask. doubt depriving world anything miss. 100% joke went head. Spanish flu 2.0 3..... 2...... 1..... True. would interesting see venn diagram show communities overlap

A years ago saw article belief conspiracy theories. boiled believing one opens believing many mindset. primed believe government using fluoride drinking water control population, much step anti-vax, chemtrails, even moon hoax belief. COVID hoax anti-mask beliefs dovetail right them. think balance. think lockdown long absurd, everything open restrictions obviously good either.

A mix good government actions (such mandatory masks lots testing) localized, short, to-the-point lockdowns stop massive outbreaks seems would best, no? Weird, Shelby county overwhelmingly democrat appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* Precisely, measures effect. sense destroying people‚Äôs lives. States going back work school similar results not. sick vulnerable stay home otherwise it. difference ever. rolling back guidelines everyday. Hospital employees work positive results long wearing mask, don‚Äôt test return work, quarantine time reduced. rolled Federal level? Seems crazy put burden states. chosen primary. fault older voters rather take vanilla left radical left. Plus view also democracy. Bernie left lot people okay people feel way. remember reading something Trump limiting access data american health organization (CDC, DGS? can't remember name). 

Maybe someone specifics, I'm sure search bring up. around cases really spiking. drop makes little sense imo, seen change significant enough justify it. Maybe I'm missing something well, reading checked differing policies order bad image. shut universally per scientific direction, avoided 99% loss life. Unfortunately, get worse gets better.

If stay course try business usual, even 1% death rate would 3.3 million people, everyone caught it.

195k month insane, hopefully come that. real death statistics reported hidden public, obviously high number. also know long term implications. People got it, survived could still heart attack 3 months later. Add flu seasonand reductions vaccinations, along side severe weather events whole thing becomes exponential. said before, people diet go back old habits, gain old weight back. (Most) People change lifestyle dietary behavior, lose weight.

Whats hard understand sentence? eat like shit, cut calories, lose weight eat like shit again, gain weight. Thats restricting caloties temporary diets work. change eating habits cut certain food good.

Stop complaining, willing change lose weight. certain point, better admit know keep changing timeline. Rather blaming name, blame culture instant gratification begin understanding stupid names come from. starters, never said make $170k. don‚Äôt SUV bells whistles. minivan family 6. mortgage $2k 3 bedroom ranch house. I‚Äôm shit school district high property taxes. HOA fees either. Oh, family lives close they‚Äôre able assist child care. get take probably visit high end restaurant MAYBE year special occasion.

Yes, people like exist. I‚Äôm one them. YES Presumably they're basing population research subjects know infection recovery time points they've modeled probability infective re-exposure time for.

If so, they'll hopefully able time frame continued monitoring validation subjects activities. Even social distancing masks isnt realistic years. People already getting antsy. Kids literally least effected this. yet someone thread said even know bad could winter. 

1. get better summer.
2. going get even worse come winter.

Pick one. government currently showing real life demonstration history theory strong men make good times, makes weak men, weak men make bad times. models based around environment regulations place mitigate spread. Believe me- want 20% cut badly, regulations place even areas like Sweden decreases amount super spreaders roaming around densely packed areas. little doubt lot areas would see another surge completely opened regulations, testing, contacy tracing, etc...in place. needs Adam Ruins Everything episode. Oh wait is, virus though Red head Type blood here. I‚Äôm invincible.  Eh...? We‚Äôre beginning/middle thing. Declaring victory might jinx it...

Do remember, back days, people declared victory Australia?

Keep folks. ASHRAE recommends MERV 13 filter coronavirus. going 100% effective sure, reduce viral load air. much good depends many air changes doing. Really? NEVER history EVER viable vaccine coronavirus effects humans 7 them. , means go ahead inject fast tracked magic one came nowhere. 

I guess everyone forgot months ago introduced narrative antibodies infected lasting months? 

How hell think vaccines work?!? sure dare 2020 ""hold beer"" moments. Anyone get cytokine storm. Yes, immune response hit harder someone built strong immune system get high viral loads. However, point look like common young healthy people get point cytokine storms like 1918 flu pandemic. 

Keeping healthy habits still recommended. Although might caveat endurance runners food production workers might actually overworking compared others. look fit working conditions allow Covid-19 reach high viral loads first place. seen info colder temps allowing virus remain viable well. 

We wipe groceries let sit recommended time putting freezer, even then, they're still cold wipe them.. ready eat still handwashing wipe surfaces pulling food prepping cook. 

My hands like sandpaper. 100% agree orange one course not. America price human always negligible compared amount political support gain saying stupid things like this.  serious? article specifically talking fallout chaos combination Covid Flu hospitals, death toll pretty bad. also telling get damn flu shot least keep half control. Apparently 36 percent Americans got flu vaccine last year that's gonna cut time. anyone hear thunderous applause distance? analysis 730,000 IQ test results researchers Ragnar Frisch Centre Economic Research Norway reveals Flynn effect hit peak people born mid-1970s, significantly declined ever since.  convincing evidence yet reversal Flynn effect,"" psychologist Stuart Ritchie University Edinburgh, involved study, told [*The modern society makes domesticated consumer animal.

Eh think Flu season likely almost completely truncated due social distancing masks. 

This coronavirus extremely transmissible, far average flu. precautions work reasonably well effective influenza transmission. young friend mine randomly heart attack. wonder covid. Austin? Also live username. Guidance public different would provide professional guidance.

What doubt mean high confidence immunity recovered patients least point.

To make statement immunity lasts 3 months that's solid enough tell regular people, need significant set patients infected recovered known time frame, follow patients three months, \_then\_ follow still build model high confidence significant number patients \_should\_ infected again, save immunity. Idaho's cases per person little bit Arizona right now. Hopefully get minimally hurt. I‚Äôve read quite things mention they‚Äôre expecting coronavirus numbers explode colleges schools begin in-person classes. anyone know around expect happen? colleges starting now? Sept? article says expects 50-60% effective. we're going need lot people getting it. nuance attempt absolve federal government failure job falls flat. nuance pointed first comment.  '...worst fall we've ever had' **so far**. Unless warp 10. According nytimes number deaths related directly tied covid probably 200k cdc predicted early March (200k 2 million). go what's going countries winter going now? winter southern hemisphere. COVID-19 slowing no? thought virus would find hard spread warmer climates/ spring summer months due heat. evidently case.

And make sense neither places southern hemisphere, summer January-March, COVID spreading like wildfire. Cocacola decided. I'll know live major metropolitan area, died Covid. symptoms tested. There‚Äôs way EVERYONE asymptotic 102 days ones. 1pm announcement confirm infected 50000 tests done 2.5 days cases found linked family. Pretty clearly I'm citing range 30 percentage points, I'm citing particular source. I've seen multiple articles go sub citing high rates asymptomatic carriers. highest remember around 80. could probably go find 50% want ""get me"".  

The fact still remains there's fairly high chance would know infected -- especially healthy enough work 12-hour ""physically active"" date. Yes, increased data collecting testing treatment, combined temperature scanning data *now able warn people* they're A-ok carry *don't* one. one exception cause ""fever"" disprove rule *most* fevers indicate infection *some kind,* likelihood someone sick needs get checked returning business usual. exceedingly querulous this, multiple sources experts cautioned people understand knowledge constantly evolving, public health recommendation made based currently known, might hypothetically known future. mad got inconvenienced procedure could catch least covid-19 cases help mitigate damages? wait 2 weeks, everyone always brainer happens aerosolized particles blown around turbulence? Air go straight stay there. It‚Äôs 30 days, I‚Äôll definitely keep mind. manager. take 3 weeks nothing us.

It's actually 4 weeks. Apparently boys like said. Hopefully world knows us idiots.  new research leading conclusion 20% asymptomatic, temp checking still I've never thought smart man, 2020 really proving somehow overestimated him. They're taking two-week break. 

I get joke, actually four weeks (returning 9/14).  complete bunk. Granted, exhaust valve filter outgoing air, would rather around someone wears high quality commercial mask exhaust port average jackass wears piece cloth face.

I would think simple act protecting wearing proper mask (exhaust port not) going protect others wearing cloth would proper filter makes much less likely virus.

&amp;#x200B;

Example: 

2 jackasses, &amp; B. Jackass wears piece cotton cloth (\~60% efficiency). Jackass B wears proper n95 (95% efficiency) p100 (99.99% efficiency). 

Both jackasses go store, first passing someone Covid go shopping quarantining home. Person gets 40% dose Covid. Person B gets 5% (n95) 0.01% dose (p100). 

A week later, HIGHER chance spreading covid? jackass likely caught jackass A.

&amp;#x200B;

Pardon jackassery...I went little crazy there... again? Seriously....

Go ahead reread study understand about, try again.

Pay special attention lines like Furthermore, performance valved N95 mask likely affected exhalation valve, opens strong outwards airflow. valve compromise protection wearer, decrease protection persons surrounding wearer. comparison, ***the performance fitted, non-valved N95 mask far superior.***

And makes unfeasible directly measure size small (aerosol) droplets setup.

And take even further, go ahead identify valved n95 mask tested, [this picture masks thing tested pictures raw material sample.

Also pay special attention Again, want note mask tests performed (one speaker masks four speakers selected masks) serve ***only demonstration.***

Remember, one brought study up. read it, understand it? say claim does. exactly thought process. won‚Äôt waiting line get one first, I‚Äôll probably hold one year so. I'm anti-vax I'm bit hesitant one right now. incidents new vaccines past, want first round recipients, I'm sure anyway. lot people considered urgent hopefully bugs, speak, come time. 

So I'm wondering they're asking people polls categorizing refusals anti-vacc. What‚Äôs alternative?

Like... long debt ladden spending ass, goes far. Ask American making median household income. true. seen non Indians say test that's impossible. forget testing equals labs, test kits, qualified humans, resources testing it, transporting managing cases. population 1.6+ billion near impossible. Anything pass though would ruled invalid courts put hold  b/c i'm curious mf [12 august 2020, reported 712 confirmed new cases, percent positive 19.6%. today [13 lower percent positive 15.7%, fall line *whatsoever* grand scheme, [3 similar low dip 15.2% [1 18.5%. come peculiar 13th 907 cases, 3rd 1105 1st 1491. dips rises [very though--you'll need scroll find chart labelled 'Percent Positive COVID-19 Molecular Tests Previous 28 Days' clarification.

on [15 percent positive 21.6% tests day totalled 1850 confirmed cases. general figures early-mid july 2000 cases per day. percentage nowhere near averaging half, numbers confirmed cases hovering closer 1000 2000 time now. another unusual thing: 3rd (monday) 1st (saturday) higher figures 12th (wednesday) 13th (thursday). 

unless wrong, then, SC seems far less testing. oddly, nearly 300,000 tests total conducted since 15jul today, similar 15jun-15jul, also nearly 300k tests. make much sense, unless i'm mistaken, SCDHEC transparent calculate percent-positive figure (the link gave past 28 days chart explains it). 

as aside, i've heard anecdotal reports people getting tests back within days, rather weeks. people still bitching 3 days wait, 3 *weeks*... 

the total number mobile testing clinics nearly doubled time frame well (94 141), idea they've cut back doctor's recommendation only, accepting asymptomatic walk-ins. sorry, maybe someone else knows.

SC cumulative case rate 2000 per 100k death toll 2089 confirmed, 97 probable. goddamn trajedy.

I sincerely hope best Americans. Good luck loop now, right? similar situation. Random grades back back setup time between. people ask school late, always, ""I setting up."" understand teaching music (or art) six different grades equivalent teaching six different classes (but without extra preps). feel friend. 1000 kids sounds like step short Hell. You‚Äôre misunderstanding. I‚Äôm saying lot instances people aggressive masks necessary. 

If sidewalk there‚Äôs nobody us within 100 yards, walk past brisk pace *without masks on* (GASP!) odds transmission scenario pretty much zero. 

In fact, general, you‚Äôre occasionally passing people street you‚Äôre going transmit virus. takes time get system (as contaminated air 15+ minutes). 

But people would freak even first scenario masks. That‚Äôs backed science people don‚Äôt get that. cannot guarantee get precautions 100% perfect. deaths one day US 169 countries total deaths (in comparison) entire pandemic response. There's downplaying terrible is. Good thing republicans responded counteroffer.

Careful wish for. See ya 10 years realize shortsighted are. thinking electrostatic sprayers? 

Don't ask exactly they're supposed work, guess charge particles disinfectant solution that's misted machine. lets disinfectant coat surfaces evenly exposed sides, visible surface. still use disinfectant solution. 

I'd assume that's they're using. company bought sold almost 8,000 sprayers week around $800/sprayer, imagine they're pretty prevalent. Technically, asymptomatic people fevers. Symptoms things felt patient, asymptomatic patient feel fever still counts asymptomatic. launder money literally laughed loud one place tried tympanic temperature probe even come close eardrum. agree disagree article one really simple reason. mask protects virus, can't spread it. exhalation valves moot. still worried, give comfort exhale valve. slip surgical mask top.

I'm surprised we're six months pandemic, yet official sources still spreading falsehoods, all, ""everything government touches turns crap."" heard COVID-19, said everyone wear *at least* surgical mask, probably spreads aerosols. took gov't *weeks* recommend cloth masks *months* admit maybe airborne.

I wear reusable respirator P100 filters whenever go public. mask exhalation valve I've thought hard this. mask highly effective. mom, person contact sans mask, wears N95 whenever leaves home. chances spreading virus basically nil I'm extremely unlikely get it. Leave states scramble. Geez. even mad first place then?

A lot ""idiots"" older stubborn folks, shit drama people wearing masks see true nature crowd. Almost like bandwagon jump nobody really gave shit first place. It‚Äôs realistic won‚Äôt happen. Gates said: ‚ÄúThe true end come spread natural infections vaccine giving us herd immunity. rich countries, sometime next year, ideally first half. We‚Äôll get end 2021.‚Äù agree we‚Äôll 100% normal end next year we‚Äôll likely phasing normal probably starting February-March next year things go good vaccines they‚Äôre approved late year January 2021.

What we‚Äôre right (social distancing, constant isolation, work, distance learning, etc.) won‚Äôt last end 2021. It‚Äôs feasible. Blitz, like London had. Years covering windows prevent light seen German bombers. way Americans would agree that, idiots everywhere using spotlights signal enemy aircraft. 4-8 months would guess. One job thing saying like 93/94 (Im usually ~98). think made cutoff 100 degrees would need somehow go work actual fever 105¬∞F denied entry. 

Its show tbh. must sadly admit wrong. think would horrible stupid enough hold help midst greatest crisis we've generations. sad guess happened...

Deaths went half April levels? new. know lot yet still learning things like potential long term myocarditis. Yeah, people *probably* can't catch twice, there's bits pieces warrant caution scientists continue study new thing. 

Best let rampage society hope best truly beautiful shithole country. best shithole country world ever seen. mean prior beginning pandemic (and contract it), one immunity disease. case established diseases.

This means disease burns communities groups much rapidly. I'm sure least there's purpose protests, self centered scumbags protesting masks hand think ""rights"" important anybody elses. Wearing mask damn political statement, inconvenience wearing one you, fellow man, want patriot? wear mask protect somebody else, anything else selfish. We're nation give shit one thing Trump succeeded dividing us. Oh wow absolute cunt baguette. point declare government lost legitimacy? Yes. Please keep wearing respirator like me. people this, virus would wiped map. first I‚Äôve adjusted Man americans *really* love absolutely fucking everything conceivable way. 

This go well waiting money desperately need shit. day one. enter numerous places per day. Every place different thermometer, test different spots times correctly. 

Iliterally laughed loud one place tried tympanic temperature even get probe close eardrum.

It's total **BS**. surprised depth advise needed get public.

i mean look anti maskers. Honestly rhough, americans laughing stock world days... actually vacation. going back home states raise spend campaign money get re-elected. break session go back host Town Halls listen constituents would rather DC passing stimulus bill country begging since March! see reason shouldn‚Äôt go till Halloween. We‚Äôre smooth-sailing ship. Amirite! stomach bug infectious like flu? Main reason I'm getting we're already halfway season really want go pandemic Dude dense, study labels masks. #2 box. performance fitted, non-valved N95 mask far superior.

Ya shit, talking comparing valved N95 cloth masks. never said valved N95's better non valved N95's considering exhalation.

I read study raw data used make analysis. I'm happy change position prove point actual data. rate they're gonna outlast white man take land back. clear, vaccines 'reactivate.' couple (not covid) vaccines 'live attinuated' meaning virus weakened, vaccines persist body days. remains body cells proteins remember vaccine looks like help fight infection future.

BAHAHAHAHAHAü§£ü§£ü§£  Ahh screech intellectually lazy.

I guess easier push lie ""bOtH SIdEs SaME!"" instead thinking yourself. Funny? Lol 

""White people hope. Ooo hope nobodys seat concert tonight (nasaly nerd voice)

I looked schedule, calendar session actually means vacation days... 94 days insane, average American gets something like 10-15 days off: house passed bills months ago trying help American people. Stop ignorant. haven‚Äôt vacation 10 years. Fuck them. government soon start handing IOUs Hahah blaming someone else. take better care yourself.

Wearing wrong mask acknowledges aware danger, purposefully protecting yourself.

It could well lack education ignorance valves work. forced get new one, buy wrong one.

In America, masks controlled like countries. People freedom buy many masks afford. unusual buy bunch masks keep around house. getting rid existing masks zero cost? Without understanding thought process, cannot say someone bad person uneducated. bigoted hell.

No bigoted hell. objective. Well play Big Ten hockey  Hours enclosed space. ‚ÄúThe left‚Äù armed generations. diversify arms stock too. wouldn‚Äôt really notice though don‚Äôt advertise it.

No, won't. everyone saying need get back normal saying they're okay killing thousands people indoor ski/snowboard hill work close proximity kids learn ski aside cold low risk sadly we've tried nothing we're ideas! Reminds Dave Chappelle skit. Real IFR closer 1% - people heart attacks home takes month get valid cause death. 

Most masks valves still funnel air via filter going valve downwards cloud. 

A cloth mask aerosolize virus layering thin! CDC focusing right problem. High horse? thought sitting stool server‚Äôs fault chicken burnt? didn‚Äôt cook it. 

Why assume flirting? could talking work. Sexist. It‚Äôs catch crime classification think levels warranted (no pun intended). drives nuts reading articles ‚ÄúCongress stalls relief‚Äù House passed legislation months ago. what's name, mind asking?

REPUBLICAN SENATORS* also said anyone said protesting also spreads coronavirus I‚Äôd willing conversation guess what, you‚Äôre person of... idk, lot, even admits protesting spreads it! conversation condemning ‚Äúopposing group‚Äù they‚Äôre fucking thing!

Take anything want walk store. Fuck them, getting tax money great post come see right get told hours cut 40 16. Yo ho ho one right mind thinks work, want kids back school. That's matters people making decisions arranging it. ill look that, thanks. gotta careful cuz also take stuff like adderall ADHD gotta make sure nothing conflicts You‚Äôre arguing someone never admit wrong point. Save stress. ... intelligent person, you? anyone compare localized car accident fucking global pandemic? 

This comparison beyond idiotic, know know that. antibody testing NY showed 70% hispanics blacks antibodies compared 20% whites. think higher rate infection death social conditions eg use public transport, housing crowding. 
If thing second run around NYC would expect white hispanic black infected. BLM protestor need go assholes homes leave live outside Auckland trying go holiday batch.  Small size city like Peoria 
Or Joliet 

Enormous passes 3 million Lol gtfo  someone could predicted this. need cite every vaccination ever made? Unless vaccination 100% effective, still capable carrying passing virus. nothing else, sufficient antibodies initial trials take 3-4 weeks, take second booster. basically become asymptomatic carrier. hard predict viruses pathogens cause next pandemic. handful scientists surprised pandemic, assume next pandemic caused influenza virus coronavirus.

You look [WHO's list prioritiy update every year diseases feel become health emergency future. I'll wait 4K Disk newly put together $5k home theater.

Every last one fired next term. also making $239/week Marland pua paying right see fast pass bill week two bullshit! buy new parents, right? I'm ready make first three months. I‚ÄôM SORRY HALF?! America, chance fix mess you‚Äôre going take it. give up, really do. I‚Äôm sorry half take best still watch country fall apart. Starting ""So ..."" implies conclusion. led conclude world's leading scientist conspiring? never said hinted it, anything said.

I said Dr. Fauci (by admission), liar trusted. say lying case, said cannot trusted anymore consequently cannot know telling truth.

You asked opinion, suggested opinion insulting way. tried show original suggestion opinion insulting formulating example phrase structure yours.

One opinions Dr. Fauci wrong lie effectiveness masks, discuss want. proposed version without liability stuff Dems turned down? may really dumb question please don‚Äôt judge me, homeland security thing 9/11? always thought something thats forever. Don‚Äôt even, Unless history rewritten. people go hungry hell yay place stay that‚Äôs bad shit happen. let family starve raid ur house guess I‚Äôm Oh yea don‚Äôt even go indoors it‚Äôs home home someone quaranteam. occasionally grocery store it‚Äôs urgent set 15 minute timer always leave it‚Äôs up. 

But you‚Äôre outside spaced moving around you‚Äôre really pretty safe. I've stopped. barely bother hand sanitizer anymore. Contact transmission negligible. stopped air transmission would die out, people can't wrap heads around mask wearing. 

Here's important rule thumb covid: around people live with, think would happen one smoking. hair clothes would end smelling like smoke, transmission risk masks required. something us relate lets us build mental model safe isn't. 

Also, need stop thinking personal risk this. exists line risks face every day. risk dying every time get car, take shower, eat food.  problem covid personal, societal. required reduce transmission keep 1:1 get back exponential curve lots people end rolling dice becoming infected small percentage die needlessly. need work together part keep transmission level low keep needless death down. 

Opening schools without mandating masks insane. creating super-spreading event *every town, every day*.  We're basically forcing needless death herd immunity infection happen right we're approaching finish line able get herd immunity vaccination. completely avoidable tragedy making. know health experts shouting loudly could end millions dead, outcome definitely still possibly, schools open mask mandate, likely becomes. good term this. Recently expressing frustration someone focus cleaning workplace elsewhere. hard express angry cleaning. Hygiene theatre, meant distract us, exactly why. shit, sherlock. Presenting example second stimulus, nothing Somewhat disappointed. Huh? Quite opposite. McConnell knows exactly he‚Äôs politically shrewd. 30 million homeless 30 million can‚Äôt vote GOP. bother spending another dime poor go rich?

Also, American people lazy rise up. hope I‚Äôm wrong Trump steals election November. case, health authorities dropped ball. Recently lifted restrictions small gatherings catering churches churches accepted signal ok anything want. think results come end August? 43 teachers resigned, many haven‚Äôt officially resigned calling sick. Arizona teachers already know full well walkout 2018 schools forced close enough teachers show up. think percentage 50% school. need say Republicans can't agree. important distinction. And, even 20 years ago...there actually ability parties work together.

Now? much. brings back original point.

In defacto two-party system, one decides stop governing, whole government would literally implode party same.

One would think GOP's behavior last 20 years would ill advised long-term sustainability. been....hence, McConnell's smash/grab judiciary.

In words? Republicans never going regain voters they'll lost, per electorate baby boomers.

There's going dramatic sea change within American electorate. Pull chair enjoy show November (continuing 2018 elections). blatant disregard common sense practices

Who gets define ""blatant disregard common sense practices"" mean? 

Is Portland place, continuous outdoor protests police? Unless one thinks wearing BLM t-shirt protect covid, large outdoor protests middle pandemic seems fall ""blatant disregard common sense practices"". 

So covid resources places BLM protests. would feel that? Cool? Yeah better virtual learning point ready pitchfork reasonable explanation. basically son‚Äôs car found run plates goes address weren‚Äôt one using car. think voting Biden stop Covid convince people wear masks??? That's easy! fanta menace said slow testing, gross sith lords complied. Every one ousted immediately. Also, also includes rent/mortgage assistance, election security, food assistance, That‚Äôs true, us care. seems us still stuck rooting teams screwing us every day. We, people, vastly outnumber corrupt plutocrats need united want take back democracy fact see sentiment upvoted shows could headed November.

Plan accordingly. Ashes ashes fall down. Thanks says thats going case covid vaccine, seen nothing that. That‚Äôs huge topic arm yourselves? Truth!

They knew Trump would sign executive order anyhow. posturing Trump gains pop points giving money. 

No matter wins November COVID done day later. matter wins, riots too. know faring badly?   almost 1 million

They give shit. lost one coworker COVID already. distribution approved vaccine that's going take time. Abolishing Senate would preference. serves useful function. I'm hoping. We're distancing masks everywhere knows long lasts. CDC recommends less 1 quick sip per hour. 2 really thirsty.

Given that, long overrun hospitals start going back.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* keeps saying that?? Remindme ! 3 months study masks, rather testing procedure apparatus?

That tests macroscopic droplets aerosolized particles, large dead spots, narrow field view illumination laser?

The one claimed testing n95 respirator, one pictured listed materials?

That authors said demonstration taken usable data?

Yes, read study, say people think does, ""data"" reliable. demonstration recreated verified yet.

That may enough shy away things like fleece gaiters, enough drop guard take risks over. Jumping believe anything says take easy whatever want without taking consideration validity source sloppy science. problem can‚Äôt lockdown forever. intent lockdown prepare hospitals, acquire PPE, learn virus, move closer vaccine, increase testing, hopefully find treatment alternatives. 

Everyone likes dump big bucket shit response US justified based lack leadership rhetoric. said whether test capacity absolutely increased, even it‚Äôs fast people want to. acquired PPE healthcare workers. know limits ventilators. understand spreads March, April, May. closer vaccine today four months ago. 

The fact world interconnected can‚Äôt go back hobby farm everything survive. relies complex, global supply chains. means people need working, around world, get goods services need be, needed. 

We shit politicians fact EVERY FUCKING POLITICIAN ECONOMIST knows lockdown viable solution months. It‚Äôs not. 

Everyone says ‚Äúso fuck businesses!!!‚Äô‚Äù tens millions without jobs may return decade more. 

Who going pay unemployment decade? federal government? one relies taxes borrowing get funding? would essentially businesses bringing revenue? Maybe borrow money infinity continue say SHUT SHIT MONTHS better hope borrow much want, want it, forever...or fucked. Like going school. think getting sick better locking years......  day distant future, pandemic makes textbooks like 1918 flu, current Republican politicians remembered asshats were.

Important note. Yes, agree. death rates number's especially percentages justice impact covid says 5 months there's 100,000 cases. 38,000 recovered 1800 deaths. 61000 people?  Sssshhhhh.

Want proof? Condoleezza Rice. fever got IR temped. said 102. Usually 96.8-97.7

My fever may really 102.6 thing still said 102.2 Fewer seeking testing because:

A) shocking number people Texas don‚Äôt think Covid problem get tested

B) test results take way long get back. bother getting test? (Rapid tests insurance $350 spend people getting rapid tested right exposure completely useless negative)

C) afford isolate 14 days? don‚Äôt get tested pretend like fine. Many people cannot work home need paycheck. Others selfish. know family direct exposure notified that. vacation planned went beach another state w/o testing isolating anything next day told test/isolate. Haha rebels, nice. Like it‚Äôs drug packaging? Vent clean air top, corona infected air bottom, circulate multiple times per hour.

Don't need degree figure one out. way data support longer lasting immunity (see SARS NCov1 T-Cells) longer lasting immunity fucking watch. Rates premiums going go due "" unforseen excessive insurance payouts"" Comparing COVID H1N1, far fewer deaths related COVID H1N1. didn‚Äôt lockdown control bs.

Are ever going able live normal life again? ""All evil stuff world caused group share political viewpoints. propaganda machine told so!"" - Guy that's totally brainwashed. Teachers, administration officials, kids families going great experiment.

Viral load everything; young people exposed DAYS end dying. 
Doctors nurses died repeated exposure virus pushed immune system brink.

Now we're looking thing kids teachers. like sports. using N95 masks since March. cook mine oven lowest temp 170¬∞ 30 minutes. actually makes mask much easier breathe time afterwards. mostly killed Middle Eastern terrorists... know: Sweden got largely right, British establishment catastrophically wrong. Anders Tegnell, Stockholm‚Äôs epidemiologist-king, pulled remarkable triple whammy: far fewer deaths per capita Britain, maintenance basic freedoms opportunities, including schooling, and, strikingly, recession less half severe own.
Our arrogant quangocrats state ‚Äúexperts‚Äù hang heads shame: reaction coronavirus one greatest public policy blunders modern history, severe even Iraq, Afghanistan, financial crisis, Suez ERM fiasco. Millions lose jobs furlough ends; tens thousands small businesses failing; schooling chaos, A-level grades place; vast numbers likely die untreated undetected illnesses; seen first exodus foreigners years, labour market survey suggesting decline non-UK born adults.
Pandemics always come large economic social costs, reasons altruism well self-interest. way contain spread deadly, contagious disease, absence cure vaccine, social distance; fear panic inevitably kick in, public desperately seeks avoid catching virus. ‚Äúvoluntary‚Äù recession almost guaranteed.
But drop GDP unavoidable, governments influence size scale. Politicians react one three ways pandemic. nothing, allow disease rip herd immunity reached. Quite rightly, government pursued policy, fear mass deaths total social economic collapse.
The second approach involves imposing proportionate restrictions facilitate social distancing, banning certain sorts gatherings encouraging informing public. Swedes pursued version centrist strategy: fair bit compulsion, also focus retaining normal life keeping schools open. virus taken seriously, formal lockdown. Tegnell one genuine heroes crisis: identified correct trade-offs.
The third option full-on statist approach, imposes legally binding lockdown shuts society. blunderbuss approach may right certain circumstances ‚Äì vaccine imminent ‚Äì viruses ‚Äì example, ever hit one targets children comes much higher fatality rate ‚Äì latest economic mortality statistics suggest wasn‚Äôt Covid-19.
Almost economists thought Sweden‚Äôs economy would suffer hugely idiosyncratic strategy. wrong. Sweden‚Äôs GDP fell 8.6 per cent first half year, second quarter, excess deaths jumped 24 per cent. big part Sweden‚Äôs recession caused slump demand exports fully locked-down neighbours. One could speculate countries pursued Swedish-style strategy, economic hit could worth 3-4 per cent GDP. could seen core cost virus sensible policy reaction.
By contrast, Britain‚Äôs economy slumped 22.2 per cent first half year, performance almost three times bad Sweden‚Äôs, excess deaths shot 45 per cent. Spain‚Äôs national income slumped even (22.7 per cent), France‚Äôs (down 18.9 per cent) Italy‚Äôs (down 17.1 per cent) slightly less, three also suffered far greater per capita excess deaths Sweden. Swedes allowed virus spread care homes, major failure fixed, death rate could lot lower still.
My guess half first-half collapse GDP would happened variant Swedish model. means half ‚Äì ¬£250 billion ‚Äì unnecessary cost caused directly lockdown itself. decision shut everything down, rather impose promulgate extensive social distancing, hygiene measures, ubiquitous PPE testing, means wasted quarter trillion pounds worth GDP, well needlessly ruined education millions children cancelled health care hundreds thousands adults. suspect immense, unbearable additional cost saved additional lives, almost gains came social distancing, lockdown.
Some lost GDP recovered; intangible costs lockdown ‚Äì cancelled weddings sporting events, failed IVF cycles, time spent family ‚Äì remain us forever.
This catastrophically high price tag British state‚Äôs systemic incompetence, uselessness Public Health England, deep, structural failings NHS, influence modelers rather proper scientists, complacency, delusion, refusal acknowledge quality British state bureaucracy abysmally poor.
Even depressingly, Swedish approach always unrealistic Britain. Panic hysteria possible outcome failure system became apparent. I‚Äôm seeking absolve Boris Johnson blame, would found impossible situation sought ignore official advice, inherited few, any, working levers pull.
So now? Rishi Sunak, Chancellor, reboot economy? Sweden, again, role model. decades socialist decline early Seventies, Swedes slashed size state (though remains big), liberalised economy, reformed schools along market principles scrapped counter-productive wealth tax.
They learnt state cannot drive prosperity: private sector that. Tories used understand this: Sunak needs take inspiration Tegnell, push Swedish, liberal approach saving economy, trusting individual initiative, resorting top down, Whitehall-knows-best attitude. HS2 green projects answer. Conservatives survive handling Covid don‚Äôt also botch recovery. can‚Äôt stop naturally occurring can‚Äôt make feel superior yelling people enough seen Sweden also free healthcare.

In one study excess deaths among people born Somalia, Iraq Syria 220% comparison 19% among Swedish born citizens.

Yay people aren‚Äôt going doctor right we‚Äôre afraid getting sick? people aren‚Äôt going doctor right we‚Äôre afraid getting sick? That‚Äôs polite you. Must Teutonic influence. long stay isolated facility 14 days after, I'd that. Yeah ~~Dixie Chicks~~ Chicks would like word Dr. Fauci. Right. Scandinavian utopia much better here. Right? way handled every step truly disturbing. 

I'd like eventually, point, able leave house, that's obviously happening time soon. far yes, comtinues mutate becomes possibility... Social distancing mean stay 6‚Äô away people though, means stay home. go out, leave. Avoid places people congregate.

Of course effective.

If everyone able self isolate 14 days pandemic could reduced 90%. able self isolate 30 days, SARS-CoV-2 would effectively eradicated.

Think that. end April could 100% with. late, half country brain dead I‚Äôm angry  You‚Äôre making useless comparison, Wales population like 3 million people.

Unless vaccine going guarantee immunity? Even flu shots don‚Äôt that. ? Recessionless. there's lot Mexico shithole. Dude seemed ace grind trying figure coming from. Greg Abbott warn Greg Abbot could lead rapid spread virus. according neuroscientists skeptics guide universe podcast, non-vaccine immunity COVID-19 temporary varying degrees depending severity virus case someone had. someone catches mild case, antibodies disappear much quickly someone severe case - antibodies could last months.

TO CLEAR: reason developing vaccines extend life antibodies make. anticipate vaccine last one year. Lol, no. never understood highly ideological people honestly, seem pre-made answer every problem, life work way Interesting. 2/3 testing sites use rapid test. wonder that's contributor quickly rising numbers community. rapid tests used sites test asymptomatic people well pediatric cases. said March sooner boring circlejerk

To fair . . . open-minded . . . cognitive peoples sexual orientation need aligned . . . said subreddit become circlejerk.

It's entirely possible may meant compliment. 

They added link actually points gay dating site. 

I'm certain gay person would find circlejerk exciting experience sharing collaboration.  inclusively minded I'm certain would acknowledge sentiment wonder circle jerk must extend beyond gay community.

All know I'm judge anyone.

Upvotes around! got downvoted correct reason. You‚Äôre completely right though, health devolved different countries UK mask policies different country. I‚Äôm sorry- people stop shitting US? 
Lots states fine, it‚Äôs kinda stupid shit one whole country literally huge. pointless, ridiculous war Iraq

Most Democrats backed criminal war too, least outset Definitely seen lot FB Hypertension, diabetes, obesity lack vitamin racial issues you? lot huge genetic components, easily fixable... 21 days now, results predicted, say ""wait another 21 days"".

People like predictable. almost *want* people die say ""see? told so"". one home always 95.7 it. (I‚Äôve ones accurate one shitty one guess)
So ever get fever look like I‚Äôm normal temp. 

I don‚Äôt even bother luckily don‚Äôt get sick much. pick new one. Covid general I‚Äôve got kids. That's crazy me, someone lives Maryland. pay every drop. pay, cut service. developer area, need submit application allocated water development saying much water use, back claim multiple years worth past water bills similar establishments proving much water new facility might use. get added queue allocation, eventually build. live land without public water sewer, ground testing dig well. Ahahahaha... declare bankruptcy. Even people symptoms, people run bit colder hotter. girlfriend always couple degrees warmer (I run little cold, runs little warm). makes intuitive sense temperature checks would catch infected. forgetting lower social activity form social subgroups well, people might far away herd immunity.

Anyways, 50000 infections per day, times 5 10 undetected cases, times half year mass vaccination, times 3/4 longer-lasting antibodies. United States might reach form natural herd immunity. they‚Äôre anti-murdering animals needlessly, save lives help environment. meant bad thing? way question worded.

Pretty sure house passed relief bill sitting senate months. republicans senate chose anything bill. Let‚Äôs go!!! Nah means need booster shots common knowledge since December
Why US public health messaging lagging far behind? don‚Äôt herd immunity would wages ever stop? Mild cases COVID usually worse standard flu. Moderate cases far worse. There's real comparison, know healthy adults ""mild"" cases struggling months later post recovery.

There asymptomatic cases extremely mild cases may seem easier get bad flu, even showing possible organ damage including lungs, heart, brain, kidneys, more.

Spanish Flu high death rate poor medicine/medtech. antibiotics treat post illness infections. Etc...

If COVID occurred back imagine good portion current ICU cases would died. death rate would definitely somewhere range. Whatever difference may left COVID makes contagiousness. 

Just cousin fine that's good indicator. people (like myself) mild infections. wide range effects. Mild moderate disease caused virus include shortness breath, terrible cough, severe fatigue, many symptoms. severe cases.

And cousin could long term damage even know about. scary disease. respiratory. also vascular disease go heart/brain/pretty much organ. 

Spanish Flu COVID league, different risk groups. Spanish Flu dangerous young middle aged adults would experience cytokine storms often. traced people 35 people might infected?

I'm sure bothered. Karen went medical school hosted Facebook, PTA head, dedicated **FACT** (sigh) kids get sick. 

Never mind we've known virus less year. Karen cohorts sure kids fine.

Senate fuck Americans. press release interesting till part.

It appears anti meat bias. seem testing meat all.

 Meat consumption also raises risk many underlying medical conditions‚Äîdiabetes, hypertension, obesity, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease‚Äîthat make SARS-CoV-2 infections deadly. [recent found regular consumption processed meat, red meat, poultry increases risk cardiovascular disease.¬† Shameful know outdoor school NY wintertime 1915 outbreak tuberculosis. classes rooftops, tents, ferry boat! students kept warm wearing something akin sleeping bags heated stones feet.

My point is, meeting outdoors hard, fine, go virtual. That's easier solution - one 1915. 

But sickening see lack country. People would rather see children teachers die takes keep safe, ""too hard."" 

That's Fauci saying want open schools, need do,‚Äù Fauci said. ‚ÄúClose bars. Wear masks. that, bring infections down.‚Äù

People make needed sacrifices, whether foregoing socializing, spending money takes put adequate ventilation filtration schools, getting creative making outdoor classrooms work, even collectively agreeing wear small, cheap piece cloth faces. virus care - get sacrifices one way other, matter much pretend otherwise. Republicans time. Democrats also refused compromise. guilty exploiting pandemic try make side look bad score political points. They're exploiting privilege need hold accountable once. far... true hospital well, can‚Äôt get testing supplies back using slow tests. patients aren‚Äôt getting tested anymore. Numbers aren‚Äôt improving, don‚Äôt know bad now.  1) medical care overall infrastructure response (ambulances, transportation hospitals via car, helicopters, etc) vastly improved compared 1918. 

2) **just** critical cases. There's bunch cases need get oxygen several days go home after, sent home oxygen. Many patients would ended dead back 1918 nasal cannula (the nasal oxygen tubes) get invented 1949. IIRC ways give oxygen cumbersome less effective.  mind around .6 - 1.2% infections end fatality covid, lot require hospitalization treatment (around 8-15% depending look). Many end getting hospitalized patients would died back 1918. 

3) nearly counts evidence covid deaths severely under-counted right now. excess deaths lot higher years past deaths many sources way compared years past. main variable much excess death area sees bad covid outbreak was. areas minor outbreaks they're typically 5-15% lower normal expected deaths, areas large outbreaks anywhere 20-200% normal expected deaths. 

It's going take years actually assess damage sort truth bullshit, right evidence points thing severe many places wanting admit. sure that. available quick Google search required law. I'm sure digging could find depth info. $5 days judge losing hearing doesn‚Äôt want admit it. Thankfully daughter old enough yet school. Hopfully shit blows time hits kindergarten/1st grade since 95% Americans poor including take care kid work possibly getting covid? whole thing huge bag worms. think ever normal life again. 1 2 years itll covid 20 instead 19. Shits gonna mutate. That‚Äôs I‚Äôve advocating... kidding! Edit: please report them! That‚Äôs fucked up.  Stealing phrase forever... yep.

'Indeed us fucked bullshit referencing others say'. Deaths best way gauge infection...

Hoo-boy, spot new guy... Surprise surprise... except already going this. Business usual... socially acceptable excuses. called lot names.. biological terrorist keeping head cool, overreacting freaking out... well thats new thing indeed would head DC right instant overthrow corrupt ass government (just like fucking Declaration Independence says right to) could rally enough people. Unfortunately we're yet. Put covid back box. Even pandemic, truly shows blatantly now. Makes damn angry. Thanks underwear short shorts?  quickly vote relief reason, dont get fevers, every time flu, something, never fever. can't get testing act together.

you cant test dont testing supplies so. ask lab testing kits sent, theyre running materials even jobs. requires literal buildings factories create stuff, takes time build them. Naw they'll take anyone, trust seriously think there‚Äôs potentional severe side effects flu? cause pneumonia. Definitely. side businesses made employees work remotely due public safety, least people children. Stanford elite?

Lol. theater I'll ever go Alamo links Senators‚Äô home addresses? need protesting outside homes day night get back jobs pay for.  life teetering edge 5 years. hasn‚Äôt hindered life, legitimate excuses avoid people guilt permanently self-destructed. People would assume Pandemic took down. Glad see solving overpopulation problem! Earth needs rid good amount us humans mention people would dead secondary infections antibiotics go-around. Penicillin used treat infections 1942.  Right on. schools US ( Georgia?) advised teachers staff keep clothes washing. Totallyfuckingbelieveable Mathematical masturbation lol I'm stealing one. Well yeah, asymptomatic people don‚Äôt fevers. common o2 therapy via nasal cannula 1918? many hospitals ability give people fucktons o2?

Some Dr early thread Italy said something like ‚Äúanyone go hospital spend day now, would dead 1918.‚Äù

So what‚Äôs total number treated Covid hospital US far? 10 times number died? ...yet none 35 died otherwise we‚Äôd hearing repeat media. I, too, making joke, oh well. Here's case/death map Paulding county, running 7-day currently 14.02 dead per 100k. interesting see changes. Yes, disinfectants need leave (visibly) wet minimum 5-10 min work(read bottle), annoying, common disinfectant chemicals bleach, peroxide, ammonia left could bleach surfaces (fyi, NEVER MIX CHEM, common household chemicals produce dangerous/deadly fumes easily fatal). faster disinfecting, typically use rubbing alcohol (30s), cleaners like virox 1 min. Mild Soap water 30s good produce Hell, I‚Äôll make way Jupiter... never ending solar storm sounds entertaining. We'll still wearing masks march That‚Äôs great way put it. Covid definitely brought people‚Äôs true colors, that‚Äôs sure. one hand it‚Äôs depressing knowing little many people selfish empathy one another... hand, at
 least know now! Makes lot easier avoid people toxic attitudes.

Definitely wise woman. :) I‚Äôve heard similar saying always tried keep heart. It‚Äôs true too- think people forget important vital people success. Even simple compliment stranger enough people hold onto they‚Äôre dark place. 

I‚Äôm glad brought smile face! Honestly, knowing makes smile too. cause little extra happiness world one best feelings.

Kind unrelated, typing comment reminded something mom me- life kinda fell apart two years ago tried struggle deal own... overwhelmed basically broke down. sister known least somewhat going on, afraid tell mom... thought would judge me, waited long tell made feel awful. sister one called mom told hard time call me. already wholesome enough, love didn‚Äôt didn‚Äôt break news herself, broke ice so.

That call ended awesome even though sobbed like never before. much pent anger, sadness, anxiety letting helped much. part really makes smile happened randomly ended week work next week. mom offered fly see week. change atmosphere extra mom hugs dog cuddling, know? fly get back house go downstairs set bags guest room, realized she‚Äôd set little surprise me.

To back track slightly- whenever mom mailed package, always includes silly goodies along it. Stuff like random lego man, ugliest hot wheels could find, funny sticker. Usually snacks candies too. sent something last minute one time, hadn‚Äôt time find goodies send... sent three stale starbursts desk. told ahead time didn‚Äôt much office send... still hilarious open big package see three little starburst chilling bottom. 

But main thing always includes little note. silly post note usually says ‚ÄúLove Kiddo.‚Äù sent package right things started unravel, stuck note wall bed. particularly bad day, could look perfect little reminder could hold onto remind loved worthwhile. got lot bad days. one point though, fell wall couldn‚Äôt find anywhere. talking sister one evening told bummed lost it. Didn‚Äôt really think much it.

Fast forwarding back moms house, little surprise 50 post notes bed spread. said ‚ÄúLove Kiddo‚Äù lot little reminders one close family members loved me. pets. favorite one ‚ÄúLove you, do‚Äù little Yoda doodle next it. guess little sister remembered note told mom it. mom wanted make sure even lost one, I‚Äôd plenty spare. case. Ok...so they‚Äôre going look funds. Trump can‚Äôt create new funds. allocate already has. figured saw talked thought could reallocate around $80B. 

That‚Äôll float unemployment rent assistance couple weeks. 4 new cases caused complete lockdown. Ugh. Hottest summer record Phoenix. cant even imagine hot is. Yech. Short answer, yes. Trump actually done something people, EO ordering extra unemployment benefit continue. need 160 respirators. share.. we‚Äôre pandemic biggest risk common surfaces; door handles, shopping cart handles, pin pad checkout. Actual products stores probably risk. understand, aerosol infection first foremost biggest transmission route. Stay fuck away idiots walking around without masks. didn‚Äôt think important seriously ill virus. Absolutely worthless. It‚Äôs unconscionable even take fucking piss break finish job right now. run plates find names associated car title rental, address, car insurance tickets ever issued.

Holy Shit! I'm sure students super focused distracted slightest. Killing grandma mom dad mentally unhealthy huge negative impacts children. 

Or back forth school/distance learning. 


Prolonged covid? beat herd immunity. 1.5% Americans gotten since beginning. want wait another 40 years hit 60%?

We need therapeutics slow it, potentially short term prophylactics work, finally vaccines. top also hope mutate drugs developed effective anymore. 

I dont know background act like life sciences/biotech space. Blows mind are. We'e doomed then. normal operations mean? anyone wants example relying herd immunity without vaccine would like look Black Death bet people charge anywhere country actually get arrested, schools close next day. think around time really don‚Äôt know. speculation love walls. would interesting see study household cooking ingredients (cooking oil, etc) would affect virus. may dissolve envelope virus. beyond fucked up. 

They jail this. pathetic excuse leadership. Petty partisanship going end destroying country. 

People going end homeless, jobless, without food. something happen soon, people come called ""representatives"".   anything, that's argument something changed past 100 years makes systemically difficult maintain normal weight.

I‚Äôm glad healthy, interesting! Yes

Edit :downvoted answering question. sub man.. Sure, I‚Äôm down. I‚Äôll even cook tar! gym go wear mask walk door, least half people take workout Ok, understand school administrators politicians give shit anyone's kids (and some, like Orange Turdsicle, kinda wonder last part also false...). parents still sending kids there?

Research ass find government / non-profit help that's needed. I've worked non-profit last years seeing things inside say options know exist, issue almost unbelievably horrible making known. take digging shit websites phone calls might find help.

One place start would see 2-1-1 agency available state. One sole purposes help bypass mess connect agency help.

For example, county alone 4 agencies offering financial assistance (this separate stimulus check) able wave number previous requirements due current conditions.

There absolutely could options you, take pushing past current overwhelming circumstances fighting find out.  agree completely. Best point hope sure hell aren‚Äôt going change minds. southern accent basically slowed-down British accent would too. know family recently went Belgium. live area lot rich people (both sides political aisle represented), attitude quarantining isn‚Äôt them, it‚Äôs everyone else. Unfortunately, think America attitude now, really isn‚Äôt helping. stayed put 2 weeks, would see sharp drop cases, people would follow that, coming ‚Äòessential‚Äô errands excuse them. That's false.

If mask valve, keep infecting others (as well mask without valve would). protect you, *you get infected, can't infect people*. South Florida‚Äôs children‚Äôs hospitals seeing cases rare COVID-related illness attacks children teens.

Ronald Ford, chief medical officer Joe DiMaggio Children‚Äôs Hospital, said hospital treated 18 children rare multisystem inflammatory syndrome ‚Äî seven since Aug. 1.

Ford says saw increase coming state‚Äôs positive infection rate rose ‚Äî expects cases next weeks. syndrome tends come fast attack children exposed COVID-19 three four weeks earlier.

‚ÄúSome arrive shock-like states,‚Äù Ford said.

The pervasive symptoms persistent fever abdominal pain, shortness breath, vomiting sometimes rash pink eye. 18 children MIS-C Joe DiMaggio antibodies COVID-19, indicating earlier rather current infection.

‚ÄúOver last several days seeing children MIS-C coming regularly staying hospital longer, also quite sick,‚Äù Ford said. ‚ÄúThey requiring ICU level care.‚Äù Sure, point genius one field ignorant fool another. Hell, Dr Oz good surgeon spews anti-science nonsense scams TV.

Rudy Ghouliani fucking crazy wearing mask heat. wear 95 degree weather retarded something? Make mandatory. Done. that's usually viruses work. gonna hell getting :( We‚Äôll cross bridge get there.

I mean, really, really bad person. sent iPhone joke, idea got rid many good items. It‚Äôs theater.

Employee and/or employee relative dies directly due this. 

Employee consults lawyer. Lawyer says that's good case, government ""banned"" types lawsuits.

Not saying agree it, obviously right many levels (including banning lawsuits) ... _absolutely_ see they'd coming from. People tend make effort avoid contracting malaria water borne disease they're traveling region world typical. typically drink unsafe water purpose try argue serious health issue that's related. Good us virus still excited killing people started People turned around sent back Auckland.

Before start last lockdown, large number middle class city left holiday homes rural areas - obvious reasons desirable time. Spain estimates 0.29% death rate That's exactly point though. economic reckoning due virus. community need capability exist before.

Hire people lost jobs fill need help economy time. economy going recover completely virus hangs around. single proven case surface transmission current literature? said repeatedly forefront.

I thought pretty clear South Korean call center study... there's quote keep rehashing BULLSHIT sub? Seriously? brief perusal biography [shows went Cornell med internal medicine residency Weill-Cornell. college student sure hope man üòÇ virus didn‚Äôt wane people went outside. People stayed inside virus control. started going - masks distancing. Honestly, nothing virus changed, way studies presented confuse matter. recent antibody test correct, England really 3.5 mil cases, that's still death rate 1.1%. Every single study shown virus death rate around 1%, people still acting confused, saying ""the scientists wrong""! facts changed, virus still 10 times deadlier flu, least 6 times contagious.

Eradicating #1 goal. Personally think schools across country stick online schooling COVID numbers drop drastically. watch YouTube channel I'm informed every day many new cases appeared previous day still 40k+ people daily. knew I‚Äôd find guys here.

Theme parks essential. one forget dark period life can't get Cherry Coke Zero. Really? part wrote incorrect? second waves. It‚Äôs one wave. 

Looks like Holland it‚Äôs young people getting getting sick. Cases rising weeks daily deaths low single digits. It‚Äôs taking village days fight misinformation one good guys. Thanks sharing this. Maybe first place certainly quick it. stop rapist, eventually stop. May flare ups time time repeats it. one day disappear like things do. Stay calm. Relax. /s

They letting Covid rape us. face ignorance, greed, missing brain cells. I‚Äôm teacher. asked cover quarantined teachers‚Äô classes. Yea did, I‚Äôm still customer service position. said, said, didn‚Äôt make bad decisions kept low paying jobs. Dude... words. Welcome fall USA. Somebody get popcorn. mean low would lower risks COVID-19 transmission enough (bars, churches warehouses locations mass transmissions, ACH rates usually required higher 3).

On another note, entirely possible 4x asbestos work sort compromised OSHA standard, too... quoted state health department well. sometimes keep non-perishables quarantine 72 hours so, instead. works us probably work others. home somewhat primitive way country, work long hours, husband's disabled can't physically deal much. find simpler make sure going get anything hands I'm work. even functioning kitchen per se. home. :) ignorant gullible enough vote them. Mine always says great job workout fapped. Viral hallway photo... see Ms. Writer Lady. Puns seem somewhat inappropriate given seriousness subject matter, guess.  I'm saying COVID still around all, open enough flu problem, COVID would much bigger problem - bigger even far. Bruh literally Kamala Harris declined prosecute Steve Manuchen (Goldman Sachs dude) department rightfully told too. mention Democrats voted Bernie‚Äôs 10% reduction military budget. Sure Democrats general might better Republicans, it‚Äôs like saying half plate shit better full plate, need major reform. skip phase 3 trials start using it? People choice get vaccine could anywhere 0% 100% effective, protection better protection.

But no, let's wait phase 3 trials figure effective first. Agreed, although purpose paper introduce new, cheap, easy method test effectiveness face coverings. results involving gaitor proof concept. regurgitation results mainstream news outlets make accessible to, well mainstream, resulted misinformation. Also, make article ""clickbaity"" comforting - feels like adults charge. Adultier adults me. Come on, can't possibly understand environment like college campus, cases turn hundreds quickly. covid denialists always act like virus static spread? questions lockdown measures harsh 

I live Boston Area approaching 10,000 Covid deaths. also abundance excellent hospitals.  I'd take NZ approach day. Fun! ""Let speak manager""

That kills income cost 10 minutes max. August 8th Trump signed 4 executive orders house failed pass relief bill. supplemental federal unemployment benefits, student loan relief, eviction protections, payroll tax deferment. like implies anxiety finite resource, poor use it. would good use it? much have? soap water breakdown phospholipid bilayer sars cov-2, high heat well render dead.  ... actually (there awful lot coincidences recent years benefit them).

Anyway, concern mainly China vs USA. China actually looks vaccines areas, proven experimental treatment, USA looks experimental vaccines tested. Statistically China higher chance find vaccine works, due political situation probably share us.

While still battling virus use opportunity take spot global economy. They‚Äôre withholding money. Exactly. Far many people respect science. It‚Äôs like we‚Äôre moving back dark ages here. fear world trend continues. Neither side cares average person. like absurd paranoia. freaked every time put retainer? Like that's craziness passed state ""emergency session"" originally going retroactive, providing businesses protection going back March. Disgusting. spoke better, somewhat. sure? looks like flu deaths among children last year? 125 February country? better source? 

At point understand change mind. I'm much interested sort information would change mind reopening schools.

And since we're going reopen anyway, believe reopening schools reckless without virus control 1000 kids die Georgia? 

If fewer 100 die, thrilled admit wrong! Deaths went way up. Wtf?

Holy crap, simply incapable admitting wrong. Seriously, holy crap! wear stuffy mask

In many places handkerchief counts ""a mask"". handkerchief stuffy. Get grip, preferably reality. US Citizens - get check month pandemic like countries?

US Government - Get Fucked! suspect hatless, might wearing pants... Decimated meaning one ten mostly historical definition, pretty commonly meaning destroy large number specifically tied one ten. experience recently pedants tried get back one ten meaning meaning much common recent English usage. continue let asshats jobs again? May save us - NY much larger existing medical academic infrastructure states. believe California largest. Turnaround state/city run sites hospital systems apparently much faster commercial-based testing.
- We're actively encouraging people take precautionary asymptomatic testing protect coworkers, vulnerable populations, etc.
- surging testing sites around local outbreaks.
- Lots people PTSD April taking things extra seriously.

I think mostly combination fact want tests available. south, there's stigma around getting sick ""Whats point?"" attitude among people forced back work. Flu¬†is short for¬†influenza, comes Italian (and Medieval Latin) word meaning ""influence."" one point effect flu believed caused influence French, hand, referred influenza as¬†grippe, language‚Äôs word grippe (n.) ""epidemic influenza,"" 1776, probably French¬†grippe¬†""influenza,"" originally ""seizure,"" verbal noun from¬†gripper¬†""to grasp, hook,"" Frankish another Germanic source, Proto-Germanic¬†*gripanan¬†(see¬†grip¬†(v.),¬†gripe¬†(v.)). Supposedly reference constriction throat felt interestingly English word flu comes Latin French word comes Proto-Germanic. Yeah, bounced around. hard define moment probably. Maybe many 50% experience sort enduring effect. Maybe 100% experience ""permanent"" damage, whatevdr means.

But genuine long-haulers? define that? people cripping fatigue pain breathe. Others feel little fatigue light fevers.

But, somehow think small number simply recover never it. pretty good summary typical timeline. It‚Äôs quite asking it‚Äôs closest I‚Äôve seen. absolutely agree fucked. protest, get shot. vote, ‚Äúelectoral‚Äù wins. Votes lobbied bought. Middle class fucked. ""This helpful listen experts. tell afraid touch things, tell frequently wash hands, especially touching face."" 

I dare work reading comprehension. clarify, saying would rather government take entire year handle ourselves? used community swindled, would [tar offender among things. come covid deaths low Sweden now? hitting single digit covid deaths month now. Religious fanatics make hard get serious education there. winter going total cluster f**k school. one child class gets COVID quarantine whole class 5 days test all? parents do? going swabbing influenza well? seeing crazy high numbers already working understaffed everyone quit. They‚Äôve cutting benefits increasing hours. I‚Äôm frustrated don‚Äôt even know do. Yep, would shitshow. Luckily I'm I'm CA governor local school set clear guidelines returning person seem like anytime soon. We'll seeing California week, tops, maybe he's trying grab that.

We'll see spike blamed month many people anyway. California increased testing, spike. month later, trending aggressively upward, people still saying ""it's increase testing,"" data essentially normalized testing. infuriating. 

I'm music education. large study done University Colorado aerosols performing arts classrooms. nutshell, recommendation outdoor classes rehearsals best. can't inside, everyone masked (a well-fitting mask), distanced, 30 minute class length least one (preferably three) complete air changes room next group/class. make 100% safe lowers risk substantially.

Is school around this? HELL NO. all, ""we're going sanitize every surface, students change classrooms (instead sit classroom 7 hours room never aired out), students can't books materials toys anything. touching anything desk."" effort improve ventilation made ALL. infuriating. beginning, earlier spring break hurt us. borders closed Spring Break, quarantine installed one week too. 

Sadly, half Quebec‚Äôs deaths CHLSD (old people homes). lot elderly infected family/people taking care them. seen curve upward sloping line, clear point lock downs anything. Instead see bell curve perfect expected exposure virus regardless interventions.

Look cases state. tell point lock down/mask order/other measure took effect? can't.  although things seem like good idea, proven really anything stop even slow virus. Eventually comes. 

I want virus bad. wish lock downs masking too. man science try look data exclude bias. see it. Hmmmm, maybe realized lawsuit action help voter base well donors. 

Also maybe realized lawsuit coil open regular people lost loved ones virus filing lawsuits him, lawsuits would certainly help future political career ambitions. Also captain Clorox agent orange good ones Fucking great, sister forced back teaching FULL TIME MA. state wants kill family... Fuck state cactus, get :)

Honestly. real people would distance virus find hosts. Especially national guard lockdowns, good lord. One weirdest aspects story Sesame Place amusement park young children. Six Flags, rides Sesame Place geared towards 5 year olds. sounds like two adults without children. drives state ride Elmo's Cloud Chaser without small kid tow? Apparently type person sucker punches park employee. important thing remember scenario takes two. in, idiot one end opening school, idiot letting / forcing child go. excuse anything, I'm saying much moron pressure every angle things change. Learn facts make best decisions family. That's fantastic. I'll add list contains Habernero Hitler Tangerine Mussolini! interesting article. Makes good argument unlikely surface spread vs droplet aerosol spread virus. doubt that, it‚Äôs legitimate issue risk involved (hand mouth contact)  Camp Maralago. title make sense, 35 teachers 35 students catch covid? 35 students also teachers? classrooms can't properly ventilated, either via windows, via HVAC (which capability bringing fresh air and/or filtering recycled air *and* properly set high enough ACH rate). seem like COVID-safe setup me!

You'd rely diligent masking main line defense then, secondary defense low enough COVID rate community. no, still bunch Again, look graph. deaths plummet CASES REMAINED RELATIVELY CONSTANT. Everyone wrong now? type mask think people wearing? wear non fitted mask fits? many questions... Haha, doubt. thanks, I‚Äôm sure figure something out. There‚Äôs idiots everywhere, FL it‚Äôs fair share, main reason FL man exists super lax laws reporting arrests. Basically news outlets put shit full display even it‚Äôs arrest conviction, unlike states. Couple gators, meth, bath salts, Miami, got shitshow makes sense all. [Excerpt Canadian government flu 2019-20 influenza season ended abruptly week 12 *(note : mid March lockdown started)* . weeks 15 19, percentage tests positive influenza (0.13%) remained lowest level recorded past nine seasons. proportion primary care visits ILI lower average, influenza-related hospitalizations outbreaks reported. exact attitude lead bad numbers Sweden. 

Good Luck. Money, lots money flow. Without flow many companies work field fail. fail knock effect businesses. get world economy working again. virus going away next years. can't sit back wait. going work world economy crash like 1920's. scary capitist society, without money flow, die.

I‚Äôm starting see small problems develop global capitalist society. Annualized did. There‚Äôs link thread. institution really forcing teach campus? I've opted teach off-campus, would pissed college tried influence decision way whatsoever. guess god wants people dead kids....  much death yet people still act big deal. know anymore would take people take pandemic seriously right thing. Edit: takes real special person vote accurate data reality obfuscation.  


You understand Florida state reports % positives way does, right? intent publish lower actual % positive number hide infection rates going pandemic. action, lunatic, refused take part in.

Show another state publishes % positives like Florida does.

**6,146 New Cases, 23.9% ""New Individual Tested"" Positive Rate (Actual number)**

**7.99% Total Tested Positive Rate (Published number)** working hard hard rationalize failure.

The Swedish policy failed. numbers make clear day.

The nation led way similar approach Sweden's UK, also failed.

This seem weird you, niy allow deadly virus spread little stop it, people die.  hard figure out. Ikr?

Ironically, GOP screaming ‚ÄúSTOP POLITICIZING THIS‚Äù ones politicizing it. Anyone can‚Äôt see fucking blind. 

And it‚Äôs thanks Trump refused acknowledge masks work constantly tweets misinformation dog whistle base. Sure, he‚Äôs acknowledged effectiveness masks ONCE, doesn‚Äôt mean shit 1 hour statement, goes retweets someone says don‚Äôt work. 


The fact mask issue turned ‚Äúdebate,‚Äù there‚Äôs actually real scientific argument effectiveness masks preventing people spewing respiratory droplets, made lose little faith country left. two sides issue. subjective thing. One side simply factually correct factually incorrect. 

But apparently doesn‚Äôt fucking matter post-truth United States live in. Thanks GOP, don‚Äôt like fact, simply scream it‚Äôs fake news don‚Äôt believe it. 

And it‚Äôs COVID. It‚Äôs everything. give country another 20 years, max, completely falls apart. US know simply last. agree, seems like every state different levels individual responsibility. Here, mostly mothers fathers. young kids keep on, especially young adults ""hopefully"" try stay informed. food packaged cleaner conditions gets shipped fewer people coughing it. Plus people cook food. I'd like to, work local health department I'm considered essential worker. Hell yea! Soon, brother. yeah rush...take time. like people middle pandemic unemployment Lol nobody wants Americans, portrayed America what's seen Hollywood films. western style country better live OG exporter western culture: USA.

Making money cool. going physician paying nothing, hospital procedures done cost, amazing.

And guys' nominal tax rate higher live socialized medicine comfortable safety nets.

The socialization guys corporate. Private profits public losses.  Good, I‚Äôm sure plenty young teacher fresh college gladly take much needed jobs economy. guarantee actually willing jobs. superintendent would actively encouraging things like reliable workers. It‚Äôs they‚Äôve raised. 
Every Movie: ‚Äúno matter cost, hero reject power lie‚Äù

Real life: bes hero haven‚Äôt no. Well people driving issues?  true linking conspiracy theory websites entirely designed push specific agendas. one world's leading killers, trying rationalize it. Completely ridiculous.



Ahh go. people like could make statment. wonder wrote that. US: ""So tried nothing, 200k probably dead atm stuff kids inside building together bump eachother. consulted noone feel seems safe."" banned uncivil. back school, majority go back next week week afeter Like arguments seeking sway opinions, seeking sway die-hard. never change. 

You're seeking sway convinceable. ones who're 50/50 swayed right coordinated set information. 100 million americans think coronavirus hoax, even 10% number swayable, that's 10 million lives save. I‚Äôm teacher get temperature checked forehead thermometer every day upon arrival second school teach. always hovers around 96 degrees, zero confidence could identify fever, even one existed.


I donated IR thermometers relative's school.  Offered pony $$$$ ones reputable US based company FDA approved.  got told sent link cheap name Chinese crap school nurse said use.  SMH. =/= 2020

Sure, point comparing political chances Trump 2016 chances 2020, point entire country every poll point one direction election go completely opposite direction.

Assuming Trump chance dangerous mindset have. chance, even due cheating. guess would know... My, my, turntables! I'm certainly suicidal generally consider excellent mental health, even I've getting pretty run this.

I've certainly drinking more. understand I'm conspiracy theorist still believe discrete biological warfare repenetration South Asian countries (Hong Kong, New Zealand, etc) via - allegedly - frozen seems tactical. Also Given governments strong response containing virus seems opportune time well. Election year controversial president divided nation.

I wish could like guy believe there‚Äôs conspiracy nefarious actors rather seeing truth- elected leaders morons social systems collapsing spectacularly. heard explanation ""novel,"" in, natural immunity everyone get (unlike flu get every year). misunderstood twisted ""everyone get eventually."" sucks, coworkers act like I'm idiot coward taking precautions whatsoever. much ""how dare think right avoid share"" persecution atmosphere sprung almost overnight. tried explain science, started talking small businesses suicides went back drinking. 100% conspiracy theorist. you. Notice get banned speaking opinion it? appreciate positivity! I'm almost 30, bit middle. I've definitely focusing hobbies this. TBH i've gotten use now. frustrating can't even leave apartment without feeling like entering warzone since even neighbors crowded building bother wear mask less minute walk hallways. I'm ready long haul due ""fellow citizens"" expectations anything different time soon, though hopeful next summer could maybe relatively normal vaccine (and vaccine, since incapable handling way). take look recent post r/sturgis see i'm discouraged. literally -\_- matters one nut job wants Okay new user. Go troll somewhere else. I'm cleveland heights. needless say, n95 running mask running polluted cities making appearance lol Absolutely stupid. stupid people elected Maduro, Duerte, Trudeau, Bolsonaro, Lukashenko, Putin, country populist leader? don‚Äôt think so.  makes sense. never thought vaccine gave 100% immunity, thought generally would provide protection 50%. Please refrain judging pretending know dialogue reddit. Thanks! they're different viruses, also get flu Covid-19 time?

Yep! get two viruses time. Yeah I‚Äôm concerned things getting fixed much things getting broken more. Please provide source Sweden delay countries. Remindme! 15 months Fucking yikes, regret gone comment history. last reply you. Start listening science facts please. Polling shows 42% take vaccine $3000 price tag may go higher.  what?

A toll what, playa? didnt say alot countries report covid deaths sufficently Sweden making statment invalid since claim reality.

Right offically Iran less deaths per capita Sweden. believe that?

Bonus (The US currebtly 200k excess US excess death 190k(from march 15 july 18).
Adjusted covid deaths per capita would 579 deaths/mil. US reports 75% excess deaths covid covid deaths per capita currently 564 deaths/mil. Sweden records 101% excess deaths covid source: [Tracking Real Coronavirus Death Toll United news today source: [35% excess deaths pandemic caused article: *According Prof. Woolf: ‚ÄúThere several potential reasons under-count. may reflect under-reporting; takes data come in. cases might involve patients COVID-19 died related complications, heart disease, complications may listed cause death rather COVID-19.‚Äù*


If country like US reports (I believe purpose) like countries tamper numbers everything? Like Vietnam, Ch*na, Russia?

When even EU countries like Spain fail report covid deaths what? 


The delussion part. take authoriterian gov numbers heart like seem do. I‚Äôm really glad live Alaska entertainment already ‚Äògo something outside‚Äô 90 percent time anyway. still answered question! food-safety propaganda getting hand.

- measured 10^12 virus copies ml saliva.
- 10^3 considered infectious inhaled. 
- Half-life hours days.
- Food workers customers touch mouth time. Food industry hotspot.

So, one handle lettuce million aerosolizable infectious doses it, side BSL-3 lab? get worse? Sweet mother ! That‚Äôs I‚Äôm scared idea one talking it. Covid becomes even almost deadly Spanish flu, it‚Äôll kill waaaay people 2 week incubation time interesting responded half comment...imo second part much end? 

When everyone decides play rules, NZ style. poll intended find true reason. understand people's thoughts. information, policy could adjusted address deficiencies. know be, could be. That's often purpose polls. shit. get temp checked go campus temperature almost always 97.x Ac car running driving there. Evacuating hurricane seem weird me? Absolutely, slow normalization pandemic constant barrage misinformation endlessly exhausting. need MAJOR overhaul public education get past this....I pay taxes people fucking dumb....and say lifelong republican high school diploma. tards carrying ""muh 5G vaccines"" even passed 8th grade. nearly enough make difference.

I count 153 teachers page: less 5% staff resigned. 95% still going go. they'll need combine classes. Chill reason 50% number floated MINIMALLY effective limit regulatory bodies set. shit shouldn‚Äôt public knowledge way fact.

Need remember Oxford Forbes article?

Or antibodies=no immunity hysteria. Well recent study shows wild mice infected covid, wild mice also go onto infect wild mice. Whether transmit humans, another Yup. Everyone fine affects them. Sad. ""who benefits"" ""follow money"" people say without legitimate, hard evidence claims I've wondered... possible develop degree immunity repeated contact viral particles environment exceed infection threshold? immunity degree require full-blown exposure subsequent infection? know, that's sorta mentality. Like, unless able generally handle normal, shitty circumstances child (pay day-care get kicked school, handle special needs stuff, get sick injured, etc), tells I'm ready kid. Sure, one's 100% ready, would never want put child bad situation simply save money something happens millions kids, especially means waiting years busting ass little more. things can't plan course, emergency funds something save for. feel comfortable raising child without decent emergency fund/support system them, something picked parents guess.

I mean, judgement parents, would feel guilty something happened me, child, simply wait decent amount money saved handle normal emergency situations happen. mean, worst case scenario, I'd least prepared. Best case? I'd decent chunk money give kid good college education. Like said, judgement parents, standard hold myself, especially since raising kid personal, serious conscious decision I'd make, I'd kid disservice prepared much possible beforehand.

I can't imagine settle effectively sending kid dangerous environment they're likely get infected virus, chance could die permanent problems later. me, that's avoidable, provided make necessary sacrifices earlier life, money saved specifically emergency situations like that, mention work towards job would flexible well. everyone always achieve that, certainly possible, especially good emergency fund. Sounds like cant allow GOP hold congress. Makes sense. vaccines safe use early next year distribution hurdles. Stay home Would increase decrease current situation? Haha! means two things. pretty depressed result pandemic. gained almost 20 pounds, difficulty focusing, finding motivation anything, feel... nothing lot time, hard time feeling happy.

I like before.

However, contrary crowing comments people ‚Äúknew would happen closed down‚Äù attribute fear mongering etc. etc., actually much taking precautions still pandemic national health crisis. think different natural disaster war major crisis. hurricane, depressed change danger? Would refuse wear raincoat stuck pelting rain way people refuse wear mask? Would blame discredit science would prefer believe storm isn‚Äôt happening? No, no, no.

Thankfully lost perspective. hope looking back, relatively minor blip long happy healthy life even though seems interminable right Believing conspiracy theories conspiracy theory websites makes conspiracy theorist.

Assuming using different language impact discussion irrational.

These facts.

P.S. learnt French school: Quel √¢ge as-tu? get flu vaccine little exposure others pharmacies. I‚Äôve less 5 minutes without within 6 feet anyone pharmacist.

I also highly doubt wear N95 anytime you‚Äôre around anyone daughter, maybe I‚Äôm wrong. flu vaccine drastically reduces it‚Äôs spread lethality. You‚Äôre taking bigger risk getting vaccinated would getting vaccinated. won‚Äôt make claim daughter (though it‚Äôs likely true), talk pediatrician it. Young person here.

Not state. 90% older people. COVID mutation match deadliness stupidity small percentage US population allowed proliferate level now. laughable Sweden one world's leading killers, trying rationalize it. Completely ridiculous. Good luck you. I‚Äôm rural area I‚Äôm worried trouble voting. worried social behavior people line me.  Right, want take leave absence, good you. But, want continue actually jobs, customers want keep patronizing business, allowed to. It‚Äôs choice take risk, like it‚Äôs choice take leave absence. RemindMe! 1 year op responded to

But two children. keep costs incredibly low. manage things. ... death illusion. blinded first month outbreak CDC‚Äôs insistence using contaminated tests, widely spread.

Weeks Vietnam released health jingles warning virus, weeks Australian PM told Australians pandemic inevitable (and news Australian toilet paper shortages confused actually exposed foreign news)... president retweeting absurdist ""this latest hoax"", ""flu kills people"" Fox pieces. March 10, Trish piece retweeted top.

You're right flawed tests screwed millions, blame really start end top imo. Obviously peoples popular opinions why, must right. Essentially, want free, places ways get free US. Access places services vary wildly though, may really available depending upon live. COVID spins control much much much great fashion fuled reopening schools colleges, cost measured LIVES DOLLARS. One political party 100% responsible Alrighty! Seeing upvoted r/conspiracy strange. P.s agree comment. Yeah vaccines trial period two doses either 14 28 day intervals. incorrect. entire population risk infection mortality rate calculated across entire population. I'm sorry like that. Feel free break infection rate based age apply mortality risk brackets. Perhaps get number low enough feel good people dying. still want reopen Queen Mary Halloween scare fest thing. People telling calm told bad idea ship stupid anyway. 
I‚Äôm history buff won‚Äôt kill countrymen dumb ship.  probably asked million times, I‚Äôm confused vaccine possible contract illness multiple times? vaccine effective getting sick recovering? Iraq 2003. certainly pull together good two years. That's little different b/c actually benefit agree reopen, can't group w/ above. Sources?  This, hell ANYONE even slightly surprised would surge cases? know anything parties aggressors WWII? 

Yes, also read enough know documents FDR administration revealed intended influence Japan attacking U.S., go read McCollum get ""15-20 million people"" killed ""US troops""?

Fair point, lazily took total death toll ~60 million, cut half Allies/Axis, cut half U.S.. Call 5-10 million want. Unless talking orders magnitude really change point. Mate Im agreeing you. really need CDC study done realize statistics happening? locked challenged immune system way shape form bit sick stepping pretty much exactly two months later knew something, saying something rather obvious job derive given expertise, people die thousands every day.

we know is, knows is. mean, makes sense. give fairly rough estimate ""It'll take us one year point start trying, largely eliminate virus"". Unfortunately, problems come up, country becomes less stable, less people right thing, gotta keep pushing ""We're good"" time back, possibly add estimation timeframe problems become apparent less people seem capable right thing. Yes, well, evidently us racist can‚Äôt believe invisible Chinese bugs could hurt us. 

Some us politicized would believe media liberal party inventing threat virus. 

Some us insulated would believe God would protect us virus, despite evidence around world Christians aren‚Äôt granted special immunity. 

Some us angry would assault child job pays $7.75 hour trying enforce store‚Äôs mask policy. meantime wear masks keep vulnerable alive America dreadful country. 

FTFY

P.S. live contract nature involves 2 willing parties.

You can't compel people contract. Yup He‚Äôs assuming lasting immunity disease spreads. He‚Äôs assuming reinfection recrudescence don‚Äôt happen. don‚Äôt know answer question. They're taking precautions can. Masks, sanitizer abundance. know they're social distancing would do? Yes, think could contributing resurgence we're having. like still get groceries store. necessity. They're fighting right party. going jump chicken... I've feeling beyond hopeless since whole mess started. see people making plans leave country cry. I'm disabled, I'm stuck forever. country Earth take someone sick can't work. conditions cannot cured, progressive nature, get worse. I'm trying strong, gets harder harder every day. want shithole badly. I'm trapped figure deal accept that. get sick reduced symptoms large number idiots get flu shot. assume talking one idiots refuses so. 

The flu also seasonal coronavirus obviously year round. flu death rate like 0.1% US currently case-fatality rate 3.2%. matter hard try conflate 2. HS coach. correct. I've seen many schools easily raise million turf FB field improve weight room cant get bond money get better tech equipment. They'll gladly pay salary weights/football coach pennies math teacher. little late. can't shit another year. I'll make correction, majority social media people dont want put blame protests. That's bullshit. Food unbelievably cheap America. bought 50lb bag rice $18.50 Sam's Club.

Do idea many meals is? Look /r/frugal subs tons tons even cheaper food sources complete meals. 

That point crop subsidies - one starves. precooked meat packages lunch meat? asked question. make statement. think need take break internet day, go somewhere quiet, smoke fat joint. seem little tense. Vegetarians pushing misinformation try increase support case meat.

It's propaganda. ...or drug trafficking. Climate change isn‚Äôt going kill us 50 years. won‚Äôt merciful. take thousands years climate destabilize enough drive us extinct, never mind eradicate life planet. No, next hundred years bring us famines, flooding drought, pandemics, really intense hurricane seasons, on. we‚Äôre going suffer long time. 

We still fix it, though. long we‚Äôre dead yet, time. right. fauci, probably good guy entire crisis, telling people come together divided politically

reddit: haha right free, much cheaper costs America capitalist healthcare deliberately exploitative. ...or illegal drugs carrying it. true, serve extra 'gate'. people understand end all, real problem. Dr bronners soap also doubles vegetable fruit wash, says packaging. matches article: ""Why COVID-19 patients infect many others, whereas don‚Äôt spread virus all?"" 

Also unusual many disease 20% people responsible 80% spread, Covid appear even skewed average. herd immunity without vaccine. It‚Äôs like smallpox Lol yeah bad bankrupt medical debt! big deal! way Teachers treated ridiculous. According article School District plans fining every Teacher resigned $2,000 breaking contract signed spring. Also technically released contract can't seek employment anywhere else Teacher.

Meanwhile Arizona massive hotspot spread disease. community transmission, obviously.


Now is, case long period time. seems misses real issues.

""Young people going bars"" unique US. We've seen endless reports behavior UK Spain Italy Denmark everywhere else.

Protests happened world.

There ""but muh rights"" wackos everywhere, nutty ""Bill Gates using 5G spread COVID control population"" demonstrations happening every corner globe.

IMO almost entirely failure leadership. starts top trickles incompetent nuts like DeSantis Kemp completely failed protect constituents.  History suggests likely happen. Mid-2021, vaccine trials go well.

I enjoy much enjoy staying sober drive. exactly fun, consider alternative. moved Tucson work back January. mid-March came around‚Ä¶

Yes we've never idiotically fascist president helm who's divided country badly two. matter wins upcoming election, going schism would shock led all-out civil war.

Cue tyranny, misinformation, loss life, complete mayhem sides spectrum. way really unite kick Fanta office get semblance leadership back; literally cannot take 4 years Trump else soul country truly utterly lost. Literally everything guy says ends happening I‚Äôm optimistic right. goes longer next year I‚Äôm probably done life Early messaging young adults children impacted cemented brain, despite totally incorrect.  Twice pride, double fall I‚Äôm not. whole thing I‚Äôve saying **entire** time can‚Äôt get coronavirus virus eating chicken cooked cross-contaminated uncooked chicken. salmonella. said numerous times it‚Äôs highly likely get uncooked chicken cooked chicken contaminated afterwards.

I commenting likelihood coronavirus different every pathogen able survive chicken cooked 165+ degrees insanely unlikely. Obviously get ways, high temp kill basically pathogens know of. would immunocompromised and/or could allergic ingredient vaccine. enough people vaccinated helps immunocompromised get sick. Yep. Anyone thinks racism existed Deep South US living dream world. ever time humans consume meat?

You probably thinking factory farming thing.

And anything eat exploiting. alternative everyone starving. poverty better indicator Covid 19 coronavirus. best analog comparison Corona viruses. Go say stupid shit somewhere else. trust numbers. school, told I'd go home displayed symptoms, I'd start coughing like crazy. states become functionally bankrupt winter. States can't declare bankruptcy many simply run money normal operations. 

New Jersey needs $10 billion keep state lay half state municipal employees. spring NJ also needs put $5 billion state/municipal pension keep solvent- one clue going get from.

Oregon seen 60% decline tax revenue. Luckily Oregon, enough reserves cover shortfall going massive cuts next fiscal year. governor already planning 20% across board cuts state agencies. 20% cut assumes massive federal aid - experts thinks extremely unrealistic. Many calling state plan budget least 50% less last year.

Most states municipalities looking reductions around 20% 25% total budgets. Education huge part state municipal budgets. also filled many fixed costs can't cut cuts hit teachers much harder simply laying 20% 25% teachers. surprised hear local schools lay 50% teachers. 

Tons tons teachers job soon enough anyways. Might well resign collect unemployment states' unemployment funds run too. destroying economy, reliance put government support people. depend government check survive, that‚Äôs power government. Perhaps correct pandemic fatigue wielding big paint brush again.

I agree ""massive spotlight"" however. pandemic exposed nastiness (ignorance, foolishness, etc) certain folks always there. Agree this. least I'd put mail box USPS throw mailbox flag up. people really mail things anymore, that's good advice important mail. recover, diseases gives immunity. time immune may vary though. 

So, discussing immunity‚Äôs effect spread (R-value) perfectly legit unsupported. count? I'm Canadian Mexico I've acute depressive episode since March. Fourtunately I've able access psychiatric care I've self isolating husband. living nightmare lot days. always feel little hum fear corrodes every minute day. I'm fucking tired. feel hopeless. I'm 33 feel like nothing bright end tunnel. declared masks effective, knowing science, basic common sense, said otherwise, later said crucial. Whatever motive conflicting recommendations, clearly scientific.

He use position authority influence granted media speak BLM protests, advocated institute lockdowns encourage government enforcement non-BLM protesters.

He publicly argued February 29th covid big deal shutdowns unnecessary, March 9th publicly said going cruises fine - later tried blame Trump administration shut economy middle February. jokes covid, started losing hair 17 I've antidepressants since mom drank death 2018. finally overcame suicidal thoughts, felt ok, felt pretty good life. lasted 4 months. pandemic hit. Lately feels like antidepressants sugar pills doctor maternity leave can't talk increasing them.

Fuck pandemic fuck people charge. really.  **IF** think is, *maybe*, but: 
 causes telogen effluvium, typically tell people: 'three six months, see improvement,'"" Favini said. noted typical guidance may apply coronavirus patients.  coronavirus, there's always caveat understand well yet,"" said.

**NOVEL** coronavirus -- idea bastard going do. literally new cases three months. reason keep costly restrictions like school business closures two years active cases. That's unreasonable Yep, mention, asymptomatic spread, virus showing symptoms, etc. time sneezing, showing temperature, already late, likely spread around room area.

It's funny, pair glasses break needed get new pair. checked temperatures door, asked ""Have come contact anyone..."". 

That's useless. fuck would know walked past someone infected? fuck would know asymptomatic? Temperature scanning ain't gonna shit either, said, symptoms, time, late. least take temperature outside, already spreading small rooms.

I understand methods least *something*, could honestly much more, shame we're relying ""feel good"" tactics much much better options exist. ‚Äúarmchair epidemiologist‚Äù ‚Äî is, epidemiology one study interests decades, I‚Äôve read books it, written experts general readers.

That said, absolutely nothing pandemic seems nefarious me, apart governments responded it. You‚Äôd think 6 months seeing happen world would common knowledge Dr. Fauci president Even ones often reduced hours. heard anyone receiving I'd consider adequate hazard pay, usually dollar two extra per hour. Yep. ""Anyone patting back vaccine fully deployed, political short-term economical gains"". Sure happens, like every sickness bad luck can't anything it. fit healthy general hurt right? Yeah, I‚Äôm supposed moving back college today school I‚Äôm pretty concerned. Everyone seems given even though consequences likely going huge. dorms campus filled 55000 students rushing back around state going problem. 

There outbreak measles campus left quarantine (the spring break never ended). going stop COVID can‚Äôt even prevent measles meningitis. actual dying worse possible self induced dying? haven‚Äôt even bothered call therapist since began. don‚Äôt even see point treatment anymore, I‚Äôll stay home, suffer school keep GI Bill running, wait end world. 

I‚Äôve passed point angry anything anymore, I‚Äôm excited anything, don‚Äôt care anymore. ridiculous part making teachers attend school person based contract signed circumstances different penalizing 10,000 dollars quit.

This failure union anything else. exactly union suppose do. aggressive union needed protect teachers. Expecting people ""do right thing"" pretty stupid. covidiocy racist. implying pointing could political might also bit racist. anti-conservative political, caring life.

&amp;#x200B;

fauci around since old world proudly bunch f'd things, directly relevant responsibilities. brick used build exact power structures killing impugning people today. never forgetti Technology creating easy life that. It‚Äôs reason people responsible lives. factor though. :) wish best. People using talking point justification lift restrictions. many excess suicides compared COVID-19 deaths? Yeah - worse that. Anti-Vaxx community. also population folks believe COVID hoax. population folks anti-maskers. would interesting see venn diagram show communities overlap - important thing 'union', 'intersection' communities problem. Agreed, I‚Äôd also add regardless leadership, entitlement problem country. suspect go long enough, enough people die, mask wearing become hell lot common US. Probably ubiquitous, far common, permanently. That's established countries, come it, we're different. tell soon get back vacation. would would get fired took vacation instead fixing issue. that.

You take White House abolish FPTP two party system. includes Democrats Republicans, if's but's.

Simply re-electing enough. replace one idiot another.

Until Americans actually protest take back government, they're always going lose. Congresspeople = House Reps + Senators = Electoral Votes.

Basically Federal Government extremely favor smaller states shows. Also, people suffering worst already working. can't strike. wish Tennessee elected Nashville Mayor Governor years ago, seemed like good guy. also wish Phil Bresaden become Senator. B.I.N.G.O. I'm trying distract fact barely afford food facing eviction weeks watching Stanley Cup Playoffs, see stupid fucking tone deaf ""try something new"" ad every commercial break. Sure, lemme snap fingers become welder middle goddamn global pandemic

Fuck Ivanka, fuck entire administration Yep, issue rallying poor people together behind single cause actively trying pit us other. weed stores someplace legal. Take break internet Thanks bro typed  tar like first America revolution? glorious. think it‚Äôs time eat rich. I‚Äôm hungry. call general strike 

You literally say anything guess lol

‚ÄúAmericans call _____‚Äù.

Fill blank report news, lol whatever people wipe ass stuff like anyway. *votes false dichotomy* 

oUR sEnaTe bRokEN, time chAnGe. Congress able go ""break"" recess deal reached time National Emergency. 


Point blank, full stop. valid excuse able They've built enough wealth matter do, hurting end kinds tactics. path thoughts words sometimes gets little bumpy. Supreme Court kind makes sense though. Justice-for-life ensures highest justices land longer necessarily partisan due reelection/promotion concerns. Imagine Supreme Court justices also run reelection campaigns partake political finagling every years, would open many avenues corruption non-objectivity. requirement states want join together. 

Consider EU since that's similar situation modern times. would smaller European countries want join going essentially voice laws govern them? quoting Trump. Sure, M4A cheapest way that. government responsible paying healthcare, would keep private insurers? Still, I'd take universal healthcare system point, I'm waiting alternative proposal accomplish that. guessing like coronaviruses, cold virus. Call email Senators, two.Return work fired next election. I‚Äôm taking comment make fair statement. people vacation, recess federal duties.

They go back home supposed working constituents. They‚Äôre shifting federal duties senator state duties.

Part going back get stories qualms issues take federal level. It‚Äôs obvious two parties polarized deal imminent it‚Äôs going happen. actually better one hope republican senators going back home absolutely bitched constituents. push closer making deal. mean, Greek senate wasnt rosy either. basically oligarchy, Athenian born, landowning men could participate That's quote directly James Corbett lol.

Yes said several times already leaving, keep replying I'm sure trust time either. Non-profit versus profit nothing much money comes in. People don‚Äôt work free. spend non-profit 100% income salary one person one person company. That‚Äôs operating cost. What‚Äôs operating cost? Profit.

Beware feel-good structures like non-profit. take money, pocket it, spend remainder things like corn poor.

It‚Äôs tax structure, moral sentiment. They'll happy it. last year HS college football completely change young man's life. Small % obviously still.

Your last year difference getting free college not. difference 2 million 20 million NFL. used example year Joe Burrow. Last year gave $23 million dollar signing bonus. last year happen gets drafted late he's lucky makes couple million. PAYING THEM?!

Unless massive corporation, really. bet. Glad useful you. 25% past point storing bodies refrigerated trucks morgues space. can't even reach 25% without slap face lot people dying. 

Which say set percentage intentionally as, ""we intention shutting matter bad gets."" 75% people actually take it, 75% effective vaccine protect 56% people. Still enough prevent mass casuality debilitating health problems millions. Imagine level disregard see vaccine released people stop trying think vaccine=over. true all. never fought military large scale. Louis could never call troops occupy Paris because, well, essentially hostage Paris. Furthermore, portions military (particularly Gardes Francaises) quite sympathetic Revolution say demands unreasonable... health insurance... .....you gonna pass blunt nah Idk...I see rich, spoiled, racist bully growing  doom gloom strong post Bunch wealthy people wealthy families best make sure none us Plebs get real power? Yeah pretty sure that‚Äôs meant work. everyone could Senator iirc Patrician. Lets Go!!! GOP hate working class Americans? Lol must one people thinks everyone dies üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ Also remember Reagan fired air traffic controllers striked. strike guarantee win, especially dealing someone willing burn everything ground. they‚Äôre actually born Exactly! Think talks ass sometimes. isn‚Äôt feasible dispensaries gonna get banned violence, suggest delete comment   another essential worker, (registered nurse) join strike. Let see happens nurses leave without completing work.  Ah yes, insulting people Iowa. exact reason Senate set way matters. honestly understand okay leave. 

We waiting get we'll figure later. 

We later. 

They need get angry sticks asses make decisions actually benefit country pockets. ... maple syrup &amp; feather heads! 

Yay!!! win!!! Elbow donks around!! 

 (except heads, course) anti mask morons doomers everyone getting dumber. Wear already ? Heart problems? blame everyone who's guilty instead ""no, actually""-ing whole thing nothing happens like we've already decades. realize both, right? They‚Äôre mutually exclusive. stop virus, impending economic depression. Go away I'm beatin' it! fair, lots people use weed various illnesses (though I'm aware many don't). think weed shops certainly open medical users least Omg common sense r/coronavirus! üëèüèª üëèüèª üëèüèª Bonfires *CIA entered chat* Yeah, Republicans blame this. Get head sand. Democratic officials care little Republican officials do. need Jah! he‚Äôs trying say What‚Äôs good people live California people live middle America. completely different issues need dealt with. Different cultures everything. There‚Äôs thing one size fits policy. It‚Äôs less tyranny majority. 51% people dictate lives 49%. We‚Äôre union states one centralized government it‚Äôs good compromise smaller states still heard.  might like Biden/Harris, it‚Äôs juvenile yo suggest they‚Äôre competent leaders build competent teams. qualified respective positions majority candidates nation‚Äôs history.

Be sure vote November. matters. taste Corona knows borders. surprise Harley riders dumb live tourist town, week make run downtown. lot people state yesterday go downtown literally hoards people walking around crowded part downtown wearing masks. upset fianc√© much literally wanted yell people put masks on, didn‚Äôt want open windows order so. Also yelling people wouldn‚Äôt helped anyways. get upset every time go downtown see this. wish people would go home realize time going vacation crowding sidewalks, bringing diseases. Electoral College made number Senators + Representatives.

The argument unlock cap different discussion, valid one. It‚Äôs debated last 100 years. point, I‚Äôd argue reason hasn‚Äôt changed bigger benefit people, bigger benefit politicians.

/edit: changed Congressmen Representatives messed Confederate States America majority military side. military schools fantastic generals. whole reason Robert E Lee joined Confederacy want fight friends family. used think cops point well.

A general statement, people know age group never thought this. Vote every incumbent out, matter party. way heard. both!?

If want vote count something basically live low pop state. anti-vaxxer now?

Another illogical irrational position I'm still waiting references, proof facts.

What proof want me? making claims here, onus prove them. I'm telling think little critically conspiracies consumed. moment screeching people they're doomed unless believe terrible sources. keep saying it, 2008 again. Shits god damned ridiculous. French didn‚Äôt military. Russians, Americans. need see through. Bbbbbut, reddit wouldn‚Äôt able patiently explain ‚Äòdude, parties like, totally suck, bro, don‚Äôt fall BS, like, man, they‚Äôre like totally dude, it‚Äôs like, politicians, man, society too, dude, amirite?‚Äô He's polling ahead opponent large amount currently. knows propaganda machine feed fears project blame elsewhere. Well people (I do) generally recommended considered significant source infection. experts say unlikely get food compared possible sources infection, think probably true. I've everything possible disinfect, sterilize, quarantine, otherwise render food free infectious virions time ability like extra peace mind. got downvoted Hell back March saying it, virions survive insanely long periods time freezing temperatures. Frozen food remain potential fomite possibly years. reduce possible sources infection low enough, starts make sense look things like frozen foods next potential source mediate. Democrats trying force aid illegals nonsensical. doubt school funds that. know nyc schools giving 1 mask week. might something young grades smaller classes MS HS 30+ kids coming ever 45 min anything. Mandatory masks much more. least NYC doing. I'm CDC Director could told April, fucking duh. ""It's spread food!"" :/ Oh, knew far real life. strains fungus used intro biology experiments. Wasn‚Äôt aware last us link, remembering ads, makes sense.  Pretty sure figure reasonable sickness come with. they've done they've always done: lie, project, justify, deny, ignore, misinform, else, blame democrats/minorities/marxism problems. 

Unfortunately none works even matters deadly pandemic, failed, G-O-P long ago lost ability actually govern. they're thing left them: wait till D-E-M gets elected fix everything start process again. Stupidity, ignorance, pridefulness, lack unity, oh trump cold, kids drop football. fun factor drops immensely, especially practicing outdoors everyday teens. probably go even remainder year since even *lower* average mortality. Oregon, too, bud.

Half acquaintances outraged Kate, half outraged first. nuts. put executive order $300 extra per week. Unemployment benefits didn‚Äôt end. They‚Äôre reasonable. ppl making unemployment jobs. get et moronic. many flu patients go hospital? Thank much. Hopefully things get better us. There's merit idea think giving Trump much credit. fear he's stoking backlash failed handling pandemic, pandemic - amorphous enemy political type demagogues love. virus create fear, kind fear Antifa/Jewish/Communist conspiracy. handling virus certainly put followers defensive, horrible consequences people country due mismanagement.

I think *has* effectively done, refusal accept guidance responsibility issue, force followers even farther rabbit hole. look objective data fared versus entire rest world either accept Trump administration indisputable role failure, retreat idea unfairly persecuted chaotic evil Leftists want destroy country. reading history cognitive dissonance gets past certain point chances coming senses declines, chances acting destroy source conflict increases. worried handling virus pushed many people point Trump single point authority reference. long time ago many joined them. think people country enough pose grave threat. now, active cases match 100%, calculate ""Active"" case last 14 days reported date case. would like update avoid calc possible. Data pulled Johns Hopkins University think got backwards. us even car, let alone home. Can't see happening US...


A reasons: rampant individualism, strong unions limited unionization, lack coordination, Portland (""see you""), on...


Won't happen... ...in places low spread only. ate since beginning January means takeout/drive well. ran China quit listening idiots Feburary stil refused call Pandemic. picking dropped edible food sink assuming clean soapy dish water... wrote another post, logical compare handling covid diseases, especially 6 months worth data support handle covid.

During flu season, selfish see families? go work? send kids school?

We tell people stay home work feel well, send kids school reason. otherwise, play blame game. entirely possible kid gets flu school, brings home, go visit great grandma nursing home, give flu, dies week later ventilator pneumonia.

The comparison ""airborne illness kills tens thousands year"".

I understand new virus comparing flu apples apples. compare covid murder rape much farfetched flu fine comparison make.

I agree societies done better. wish US could done better too. Ah yes reading old covid deaths numbers smaller july. 

Look medical authority Spain agree statment. know else expert doubts excess mortality recorded two public bodies **is mainly attributable Covid-19**

I sorry trust National Statistics Institute (INE) Spain Carlos III Health Institute trust director Spain‚Äôs Center Coordination Health Alerts Emergencies, said month ago Health Ministry adjust death count according new criteria, although specify would done.¬† people aren‚Äôt jesus. Vote republicans democrats vacation means people suffering.

First person sub admit lol respect Hey, actual news never hear shit news actual guidelines anything. know in-person happening, didnt know *online* *required*. 

So digging, found says TEA says students must attend 90% days course offered. Parents switch children online instruction, school systems allowed limit transitions happen end grading period, TEA said.

So looks like there's still Truancy effect. Depending district, either easily able switch online fucked outbreak happens early grading period dont allow switching online period ends, closure school due said outbreak. That's concern, can't find info that, seems ""react adapt"" response they've decided wing here. 

So district *doesn't* allow switching period ends dont want send kid outbreak cesspool, happens? get hit truancy crimes, what? theyll online classes, that's established, apparently obstacle outbreak creates whether theyll let switch pinch online.  Either we, Dr. Fauci...neither we...

I mean doesn‚Äôt sound like something horror movies? vaccine goes wrong ends killing people turning people zombies (I‚Äôm imagining things there‚Äôs fact research suggests this) 

But concern still same. unforeseen long term heath risks problems pop 10-15 years vaccine alone. 

Is reassurance vaccine cause long term health risks? mean would shit show 10 years people suddenly start showing unforeseen symptoms even worse suddenly drop dead? 

This keeps night. yeah going end long term, possibly life long, effects brain damage organ failure.

I saw two guys walk DIY shop (where mask rate essentially 100%, people working make sure everyone coming wearing mask) masks. guy told wear mask put t-shirts mouth nose.

At least covered nose though! hit personally real her. lack empathy core anti masker's beliefs? moron adopts whatever talking point hears first?

Why think way contradictory? 

Empathetic morons would err side helping others, even understand why. Lol...wtf, talking bc America never sniffed depression. America hasn‚Äôt shit. 9/11 almost 20years ago. say that, yes. replied: don‚Äôt know

Well gee, almost like masks would good idea. Anyone good excuse doctor Henry even slower advise masks fucking plump go ahead make them. campaigned government, I'd since even I'm afraid housing market covid, damn wish better option. Fuck 2020 everyone power that's screwing up, including better two evils ""leftists' Boston :( got ‚Äúgo office‚Äù email That‚Äôs Hero‚Äôs Act fuck face less 200000 active cases dont give fuck Depends - good job? know people looking one. I've employed whole time needed it. mean feel many people do. Try again, Trump cocksucker. think everyone voted sitting politicians every level would bigger show voting. Let know elected kicked hands citizens. Nobody. NOBODY say! know drives in-f*cking-sane hearing everyone around worshipping idiots put us situation first place ""got things done"" Like literally every politician ever may want read-up air supplied passenger compartment airliner many times hour air turned over. make sound like locked elevator 300 people six hours.  I'm probably going homeless now, country sucks. Stop horseshitting. previous commenter right. either party cared American people, would made effort find common ground reach compromise. way least relief would provided go break. pretty clear point care winning election pandering respective bases making party look bad even means loads people keep dying every day, thousands get evicted end homeless. yes, eff both. two party system needs go fuck away. Goes lot us. re-stocked toilet tissue frozen food canned stuff.

Heading re-stock ammo tomorrow too.
I see bad things horizon.

A lotta folks literally zero lose yo gonna get ugly gets better first  Creepy stalk people like that. It‚Äôs especially bad people age group(early 20s). I‚Äôve seen posts Instagram(one many reasons ended deleting it) people went high school, going parties, hanging friends like it‚Äôs regular summer, mask sight. One popular girls high school birthday spring felt need invite bunch popular kids house saw picture dozen kids, arms around other, absolutely six feet apart. Couple weeks later got virus. 

I also saw something like ages 20-26 make huge percentage cases county. don‚Äôt really get along people age don‚Äôt want sound like I‚Äôm better man there‚Äôs lot stupid kids age. know there‚Äôs smart responsible young people get young people want friends maybe I‚Äôm one say I‚Äôm bit loner think partying wait, friends wait, there‚Äôs many ways virtually communicate friends, it‚Äôs like won‚Äôt ever hear want see person, fine, wear masks, six feet apart, outside cramped shoulder shoulder Chad‚Äôs parents basement garage playing beer bong shit. smart. think increasing late. But, really started government insisting people know President assassinated back 1963.  lying got us Vietnam. lying got us Iraq(2003).  ""too big jail"" scam regarding drug cartel money-launders.    
But, current government get things like sharpies Hurricane Dorian. medical issues get ""windmills cause cancer"".    
The lying used occur sparingly.  Now, lying matter course. So, since lying coming unprecedented rate (serial lying), think fair say sense government can't relied truth still increasing. would could believe me. Unfortunately able work due Autism I‚Äôm currently waiting see get approved Disability. Vote fam think matters passed house time period senate decision met passes decision house One reason using testing centers anything besides person tested positive. [testing wastewater treatment would give us much better idea widespread infections are. Nothing wrong that. tried dull sting bit, sadly wounds grave. May see better year going forward, bear burdens well - 2020 indeed trip Mordor... Good luck, may find need it, rather appreciated presence. Lost mail... Goverenment officials essential workers would guessed making blanket judgement someone refuse wear mask uneducated,

No not. saying possible, cannot make blanket judgement.

You clearly want continue prejudice already said done with.

Leave alone. rushed you‚Äôre right Oxford working covid (passed safety trials covid) Moderna working technology like eight years almost like mobs people show they're demand get back work. Political bullshit. worthless senate. Everyone reelection needs lose job. sides. Congress failed us. needs protests Congress robbing us blind bills. They're aid us aid them. Mitch's wife's company Pelosi's husband's company got payout this. tax dollars paid churches cover rape charges court. time gut Washington start over. real virus government. cut taxes ultra rich. second paragraph simply false. top 1% income earners pay 40% taxes. top 10% pay 70% income taxes. 

Maybe shouldn‚Äôt trust government money hasn‚Äôt time history isn‚Äôt misused? wrote month ago :) puzzled refuses acknowledge airborne transmission?

Allow provide brief context : acknowledging airborne transmission would classify pandemic whole new level. level 3 4, would move level 4 4.

So what? Haha! Well world cannot produce enough PPE level 4. I'm talking dinky cloth masks medical surgical masks, mean N95 respirators eye covers - type mask protect anyone anywhere.

Take account, early pandemic everyone realized poorly planned pandemic, downgraded PPE requirement. 15 years waving arms hysterically saying N95 save us next day stated - surgical masks probably safe. Nurses worldwide went position Canadian Federation Nurses Unions (CFNU) that, event outbreak new respiratory virus, acknowledge best respiratory protection health care workers risk fit-tested N95 greater respirator

Why change PPE policy early CDC changed PPE policy late inferring changed position without medical evidence support new position appease CDC tin-foil hat conspiracy lunacy. I'm certain nurses, doctors everyone getting infected hospitals overeacting. 

Back level 4 pandemic, matters airborne transmission.

Level 4 pandemic strict requirements PPE N95 masks above, we're back decides lives. point right wrong airborne transmission. point science safety. Scientific knowledge changes constantly. Yesterday‚Äôs scientific dogma today‚Äôs discarded fable. comes worker safety hospitals, driven scientific dogma yesterday even scientific dogma today. driven precautionary principle reasonable steps reduce risk await scientific certainty. precautionary principle fully recognized, mandated enforced hospitals, health care workers continue risk.

Hopefully start produce enough N95 respirators. selfish bastards! want build new FBI building either. nerve. Yes thy it. last long. Wife's heart always get whack infection. Sure enough ear infected, e one again. Daughter turns strep. Absolutely, low pay also restricts become representative. got one answer, ""printing money"", valid solution **at all**. get ""another"" answer that, got repeated answer whataboutism logical fallacy tacked on. apologize encourage thinking 8th grade level call people openly it, ""snide remarks"" legitimate rebuttals well documented academia taught throughout intro level economics courses, brought up. I'm still awaiting concrete answer, backing academic source would go long way (hint, find any), although I'm fully aware I'm probably asking much reddit. I'll wait.


Try again? Could Senators choose stay protest? Like say ""we're here, where's Mitch?"" know would symbolic infuriating literally turned backs people. Hell 1/3 reelection, easy points say ""let's stay work"" Well went brother weeks back doesn‚Äôt wear mask either, since doesn‚Äôt come upstairs anymore except cook food. Oh sure. really small results. I‚Äôm sure phase 3 results comes we‚Äôll bigger picture effectiveness is. guess around 60% McConnell responsible, plenty people KY hate him. comparing N95 valved N95, study compares valved N95 cloth masks. please show data cloth masks (as CDC recommends) superior valved n95's protecting person wearing others. Thanks! one bailing failed cities. 
 
Dems need move make deal stimulus checks unemployment benefits, Republicans would President would sign.  cognitive dissonance make airborne particles disappear awareness. Poor Cruz can‚Äôt afford extra homes paltry salary. feel bad him. Won‚Äôt stop big pharma still pushing even it‚Äôs longer needed. ""Russian officials told CNN Russia open sharing information vaccine would allow U.S. drug companies produce Russian vaccine U.S. soil.""
America even dont want look countries work.
Btw Putin said vaccination Russia free. want rude would read study instead trying change subject propping strawmen. Democrats passed plan back *May*. Republicans waited months anything, can't even agree among want bill look like. 

I'm tired people portraying ""bipartisan"" problem right straight Republican incompetence obstinance. attack me. work company large office one buildings RMZ Ecoworld people team told numerous times zoom meetings. facing hardship mean everyone same.

You want tell people edge tears team meetings struggling hard lying? Pull head ass accept might struggling mean others aren't. Bold assume permafrost going last long. It‚Äôs true. Many people school-age children aren‚Äôt expecting ever watch day even though supposed backup forms childcare available times not. That‚Äôs part sicknesses spread horribly schools parents can‚Äôt keep sick kids home like they‚Äôre supposed to. really need find ways sort next pandemic struggle find way cope next time happens. million times this. base temperature 97.5. Covid, barely went .2 degrees. highly contagious, business relying solely temp checks would let in. 

Plus, people take Tylenol bypass checks running fever. 

The whole thing dangerous it‚Äôs killing people false sense security. Well thanks sir kind soul. üëçüòÉ 1% 1%. You‚Äôre right. saw statistic morning new unemployment claims. I‚Äôll go ahead change original comment rushed vaccine, like one covid, potentially negative side effects. happened last time rushed vaccine. bunch medical professionals Britain got brain damaged believed British government said rushed swine flue vaccine safe. perfectly reasonable someone concerned rushed covid vaccine. Nobody bullied taking rushed vaccine.  Oh well, tried. Time vacay. I‚Äôm anxious time November January Biden/Harris win. refuse dine capacity, even indoors. order food takeout, tip it. Even locally owned places may wait staff really (just people bring food that's it, really, followup). Might help, still vote single GOP member Trump. Tired screwing people siding opposite side science, compassion, caring empathy. need healthcare all, Climate Change dealt actual adults understand science line pockets friends companies bank accounts. GOP sure party that. evidence still right here.

[While valve compromise protection wearer, decrease protection persons surrounding wearer. ***In comparison, performance fitted, non-valved N95 mask far sorry cannot accept fact hole respiratory compromised effectiveness.

You even pointed study tests valved n95 mask, let alone one backs claims CDC, medical community general, even study tried hold backing claim.

Or going say study originally referenced good enough reference more? totally went you. Thank summarizing exactly feel. tired people FL, TX, CA saying way bad NY cause death toll. ignoring surpassed total Covid cases months head start. Fauci cautious statements vaccine efficacy. understand almost everyone developed antibodies phase II trial. premature say probably 90+% effective. That's high number. Regardless, safe would still happy vaccine even less 50% effective. would make huge difference regardless. oh hey, live near here! cool! lied lot there.  slashed third runs end year. make money eligible ... Let‚Äôs keep paying Fucking people. Sounds like good tax break me. Houston looks similar - hospitalizations close 1,000 week. haven‚Äôt seen testing numbers though FUCKING JOKE. Source ? Genuinely curious. spending lot time gardening.  normal, everyday pathogens helping keep healthy.

- understanding SARS-2 always presents lungs (when lung damage), SARS-1 didn't. I'm Democrat, going vacation too. Time revolution !!
Fuck parties üñïüñï 5 quit voting status quo two party bullshit system. need change fucked system latest educated guess CDC 0.65% death rate. Which, true, much worse flu runaway infection train 170k dead beginning. one holds gasp different opinion you

This opinion facts facts Democrats tried help average American Republicans like repubs, actually care you

And go intellectually lazy again. Let know ready grow think yourself. sit let grown ups talk. I'm minor, I'm absolutely terrified this. really Unknown Menace long term. get (Hopefully not!) might mild symptoms short term, idea would month now, year now, decade now. That's truly scary think about. I'll keep wearing mask staying indoors.  love haunted mazes every year doubt that‚Äôs happening I‚Äôm going print bunch scary messages like ‚Äúthe vaccines don‚Äôt work‚Äù, ‚Äúworld decides permanently cancel USA‚Äù ‚ÄúTrump wins‚Äù post around house walkthrough read messages. could put newspaper headlines too. Easily horrifying haunted maze ever. /s Yes Defeat system controlling Dude fuck country Yeah, best give let whatever want. Worked well far.  Sure eff coronavirus infecting entire world going disappear one countries election lol Another reason first delayed fought hard outgoing CARES checks - get Signature them, realizing many citizens see check due direct deposit, Trumps spends $60,000,000 (of money) mail ridiculous ""campaign"" letter reminding us great plan - (another Trump Lie).

Trump's new proposals shit me, many know. I'm currently working payroll tax reduction means shit, got unemployment since losing job back February. help zilch. survive flipping shit eBay Trump killing USPS rely low cost shipping. 
Trump administration screwed political group 50+ years planet. I'm still surviving though vote traitorous, scumbag, villain office hopefully see prison die. Want man? Let's cut dick! They're way know bad fever minor fevers able felt much, especially across forehead. Personally, fever 106 degrees home thermometer said 104... huge difference terms fever Man self government sounds really nice, try nation. least job go to. millions people stuck home waiting blow get back work.

Sadly, that's going happen anytime soon, long entitled, freedom-obsessed morons continue spread virus due selfish behaviors attitudes. Lol people think this? aren‚Äôt going bust shit. Okay, 5. still useless thing brag about. Yep lol, see least much denial see doom.

The way yall cry doom passed 200k dead absurd opinion. Stupid sort random question, 1 extra hour come from? work 8 hours day 5 days that's 40 hours. literally nothing worthless entire world goddamn politician. US Senate.

US Senate controlled Mitch McConnell.

US Senate controlled 53 Republican Senators. 

Can't wait publications report terrible *Congress* failed us. unverified address republicans way. That's possible one, second even perfectly designed system there's real issue people unable shoulder financial risk politician, face costs involving dealing daily different CEOs fending immensely wealthy, living away home etc, teacher's salary.

There approx 800 federal politicians America control something like 5-6 trillion dollars. Similar countries states.

The cost paying like heart surgeon brings many benefits preventing petty corruption making accessible people walks life, benefits immeasurable.

The fact politicians immeasurably important society, need earn millions healthy sum. Shithole country. perceptions - media extremely biased dial back doomsday perspective current 11 1. even though nothing change meaningful way new spin. London Stockholm infection rate Sweden enforce masks?

Ok, fatality rate England us 40% higher. assuming you‚Äôll indicate ticket *strong* leadership? know it‚Äôs red one, blue one seems headed septuagenarian mainly seems confused he‚Äôs basement. hope contribution memorized office since 70s.... wife said covid+ parents taking tylenol could lower fever get maternity ward. Knowing right wrong enough me. Trump's lies obvious. Plain day. lead manner crime August. Exactly Rona nothing abortions letting violent criminals jail see lot state legislatures, end dominated old rich white guys states low salaries. Tennessee, least, bigger cities starting get handle declining cases people feel less need get tested/aren't likely hit contact tracers telling get tested rural counties spiking control. I'd imagine people rural counties less likely get tested, whether blah blah liberal hoax there's one health department building tests within 45 minute drive. shit. knew 5 months ago. freaking joke. Central IL. weather seems like gone mid-80's normal summer weather 80's lows. Right unusually fantastic weather 90f high heat index.

For once, hope climate change works favor... think surge infections primarily indoors, air recirculates.  Bars, restaurants, nursing homes, ICUs, etc - think need air disinfecting, HEPA UV-C.  think aerosol component, much indoor problem. love it. People actual work, like essential grocery store people delivery people can‚Äôt get time asshats get take weeks dick American people goddamn pandemic. I‚Äôm wondering people going say enough enough spark another revolution. warning come like 3 months late? 

Were sleeping since February woke reality? task force talking about? Would Steve Mnuchin Trump picked Secretary Treasury?

For ""innocent"" guy claiming ""drain swamp"" Trump sure surround tons criminals, lobbyists, corporate insiders, downright scumbags huh?

I agree desperate need reform though, current 2 party system fucked. mean almost President leader compared Trump. still contributed misinformation people taking seriously. I‚Äôm saying Trump bad sometimes don‚Äôt realize presidents weren‚Äôt competent times. us bad jobs we'd fired senate remove traitor given chance? senate? what's unfuckingbeliebeable that? not. fucking bastards care you, America. Vote out. Nah 5 call us bums wanting hundred bucks starve death die exposure winter. think poster tried shame brave doctor. probably thought donald thread. 


hey moderator, flag correct - flagging title ""post""  Sounds like really rough day.

And yet continued think wider message #WearADamnMask #MasksSaveLives  JOB Yes.  long con
Editing /s don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs he‚Äôll claim  Honestly care kind healthcare system get anything return.. times like barely get help compared nations. Sad.. Lol I've shared dozens times thread, trying pedantic hilarious point. also reviewed raw video files study like admit pedantic evidence position. decide trust study still leaves data support position. understand study limitations clear valved N95's far superior cloth masks, even user attempt mitigate valve.  Yup easy way get votes refuse. Maybe Right Work laws good idea. really, though? Ok. saw comment think schools open. Agreed!

But know are, what's best solution case, outdoor classes? DEET great, agree, meeting indoors poor ventilation going far worse outcomes.  read Santa first. Hey guys heros this. doubt compensated properly treated sort respect higher ups essential workers thrown bus truly heros. We're gonna burn system November.

Stay safe USPS handle huge increase mail security mail presidential election. funding help support GLOBAL PANDEMIC. It‚Äôs almost like putting pieces together incredibly hard people. puzzles hard you? Welp America... tell shitty government take look healthcare system. redditors resentful towards live can‚Äôt stand see success happiness others. see someone legitimately helped people suffer, gets off. horseshitting. 

What either party cared American people, would made effort find common ground reach compromise.

You mean like Democrat controlled house passed bill Republican controlled senate made compromise? Oh wait, didn't.

Nice attempt deflecting blame Republicans. Planned parenthood needs funding bill .... sure helps Rona .... r/aboringdystopia Japan tourist economy hands handling pandemic. might also experimenting considering they‚Äôll ease restrictions even olympics vocal equal ardent. talk deaths happen, missing statistics weeks months? seem celebrate even people die today, weeks ago. also seem unaware case reporting works found big revelation something thats par course situation overwhelms system much takes weeks months backfill deaths. That's bad thing way. Like ‚Äúwiping things twice day‚Äù strategy offices workplaces using. Hey doesn‚Äôt solve fact 12 people breathing contained space. They‚Äôll pencil in. exactly people wanted.  good people dying maskholes. changed counted, within 28 days positive COVID-19 test result. lowered overall death total 5,000. Wait....you think people eligible Medicaid laid off? realize majority states chose expand Medicaid therefore poor pregnant women, children, disabled eligible coverage? Hence cobra damn pandemic. Mail voting? It‚Äôs kind huge increase mail coverage cover mail voting 50 states, especially since republicans keep trying kill USPS. States local governments need money quite literally allowed take loans such. currently it‚Äôs running PANDEMIC. think you‚Äôre missing part bill would exactly you‚Äôre asking end comment. I‚Äôm honestly flabbergasted posted article shows full shit are, respond something like turns insanity 11. Yeah, might bad, look many people voted him. He's symptom, disease. Shit. I'm going running 2am Maine 70 degrees time... I'm still dying here. tried running 90s day month back. Nope.

Props triple digits (even though get dry heat). You‚Äôre right. corrected it. saw statistic new unemployment claims got 1 million. would prefer $0? would prefer national moratorium? without administration, would place (if EO actually upheld).

It's weird criticizing administration instead Congress. sounds like want benefits place (so I'm extremely worried costs). Congress failed entirely administration stepped try implement compromise, could ask situation? side note, think observation cost States good one; think President wants certain States go bankrupt (I agree this).  market crashed stimulus package ready heart beat. people needed delay delay delay. really shows running country. decision reopen schools left vote school board? teachers get vote process? arent protesting well BLM, extent more! many reasons arms shit! need coordination clear effective message major issues right now. I'd drive DC send right messages. Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Graduate students currently Stanford campus complaining unsafe regard virus. assume one unstated reasons decision. Yet know 1 person personally NYC. everyone us it. Got little Captain you?  got 11 bucks anyway lol powers control mass media. would organize large enough numbers get done? Jail time fucktard. both? man *noworries* saves day stone cold logic. :-) mean... shit. 

The US leadership, leadership openly corrupt going way fuck things divide us. Racism sexism fully open. 40% Americans selfish fuck ignorant assholes proud stupid are. People health insurance, aid, live paycheck paycheck, barely safety nets country covid already. Health insurance going even expensive covid, there‚Äôs end sight. embarrassment world stage. Thousands going die people keep saying it‚Äôs liberal hoax. post office democracy attack top all. let‚Äôs forget covid still climate crisis. 

This timeline honestly beyond sucks. don‚Äôt blame people wanting ignorant all. 5,152 Sweden's 5,783 deaths age 70. 3,902 age 80.

Sweden poor job protecting elderly nursing homes early admitted mistake. 

Their death number compare quite well otherwise. sure point exactly appreciate taking time share. unless start masking kids lol. They‚Äôre ones spread flu It‚Äôs happening country. elderly neighbor E. TN would tell almost always snow ground late December, lived 6 years never saw that, couple snow storms (memorable grocery shelves would empty traffic would grind halt). Anecdotally, seems like I‚Äôm seeing observable warming 10 years. Well plus, article false. monkeys question like 12 times normal dose Covid19 shoveled directly eyeballs...and pretty solid immune response. course, didn‚Äôt become headline. true, pre-cooking safety precautions *should* same. Wash hands working raw meat. Disinfect food preparation surfaces. eat undercooked meat, cook internal temperature (in case chicken) 165F. touch mouth, nose, eyes hands handling raw meat washed them. 

It's unlikely even raw food infected could cause human transmission. Even suspected cases China New Zealand dockworkers would spent long time around defrosting frozen goods, *might* enough aerosolize enough virus cause infection. Food prep fine.

There's concern infected food prep workers could contaminate food cooked served. I've seen little evidence that, which... given massive spread virus, would expect fecal/oral transmission possible we'd strong evidence now. absence evidence evidence absence, dataset *this large* certainly least *circumstantial evidence* absence. Fantastic! Vaccine 90 days pipe-dream. UK already recession, apparently worst history, can't wait see happens US slides too. wait, could election today? Coronaviruse mutate 10% rate influenza viruses. built-in proofreading function keep genetically stable. See Narrator: later revealed food primary way infection toddler. hold breath first vaccine work, does, I'll happily take it. Problem doctors testing. crawl broken, rusted nails vote November. Oh know, think take awhile get control even good leadership. Sucks deal many assholes. CDC recommends 5% general re-openings. article mentions mayor NYC said would set school cutoff 3%.
 Haushalter, county health department director, said 25% threshold set consensus local infectious disease experts, health department officials, leaders county‚Äôs ‚ÄúBack Business‚Äù plan 
 
Gee, wonder driver's seat meeting.  wait till white house figures revoke citizenship people die covid, could claim american died it. lead. lead drinking water. yup Trump says thing.

What even mean? pandemic 100 years something turn Trump protectionism.

This current pandemic taste what‚Äôs come. 

More novel diseases, collapsing systems governance, wars water agricultural land norm new decade. 

Your idea keeping everything open tourism good thing like quaint thoughts belong back 2010, maybe. could really put nail coffin saying ‚Äúhey, get together vaccine comes lasting 2025‚Äù... tbh probably already tried one Americans kinda forgot COVID. friends family need remember Nov 3rd cast judgement make worse America. One hell hoax/ sign autoimmunity! virus really hits immune system hard. Many never recover going autoimmune. Basically body fights virus gone.

I know, happened SARS1 late 20s.  Yep  friend 14 month old that's never allowed play kids even interact people closer 6 feet so.

Every time tries Mom gently pull away.  We're really hoping affect socially long term. understand trying say, problem medical community considering psychosomatic symptoms hypothesis, diagnosis. 'twitter personality' posted charts herd immunity days ago interview UCSF scientists recently explain data detail anyone interested - got CSU still freshman live dorms. However, CSU‚Äôs allowing on-campus housing aren‚Äôt mandatory testing upon arrival get Covid symptoms like 98% people? Nice rate seems lower before, hope keeps up. also not? never happen

Same reason people months ago saying quarantine people get planes. put where? Feed what? Pay bills, watch kids, feed dog etc etc etc Every thing kids mis single day school. 
Why school important every government. 
Almost like want brainwash kids missing schools stops brainwashing.  
religion government LAL  


( worry know education good thing ) Globalization large-scale natural development. control small-scale aspects it. carries whole spectrum consequences, good bad. 

Bottom line: can't really stop it. *""winter coming, army deads gates""* can, mostly they'll catch people went outside summer. Second wave? third lmao I've always depression all, things point anxiety wife worried I'm becoming agoraphobic. never leave home get anxious to. I'm supposed start retail job want next week savings running unemployment bined entire time wife's job barely enough own. I'm also caretaker baby works I'm expecting even keeping job retail scheduling care life. simplest straightforward explanation. can't keep track everyone. testing, want cases turn hospitalizations deaths, what?

At least seems I've noticed lately. live area really well 'Rona. still eat inside. know full winter gear drinking outdoors. might.... know Texas Florida tested l way ess months ago. Winter coming... Thank wasnt sure read right, CAPs made difference already tested 5 times past 2 months (6 count one time accidentally lost sample) showed syptoms covid. (cough, sore throat, fever headaches) even though completely certain wasnt infected given tested 5 times already isolating home sickness. took resources 5 potential patients people sleep tents outside hospital due lack space. Thank wasnt sure read right, CAPs made difference Spanish flu didn‚Äôt vaccine eight months Take look many countries GDP relation much comes international tourism. grown massively past 20 years. changed societies manufacturing service industries. 

I understand want virus go away, do. society interconnected close one part heavily effect others. Closing 10 20% GDP means less income social health programs. programs going balloon price virus. shut international travel many countries need tourism going survive going pay issues coming?

Shutting sown international travel completely solves international infection. working elimination, (like New Zealand). ~20% NZ GPD comes tourism. virus domestic tourism offset loss international tourism. model done around world. Governor suing mask mandates, really surprise COVID widespread expanding? reason thought said ""doctors"", ""donors"".  Man, bots rough. even know said trigger it. done more, sure, pragmatic often better idealistic terms getting progress done.

How perpetuating inefficiency 1000 page bill pragmatic? Maybe, long still see dust cloud hope catching again. Could came contact someone infected got via less legal means? near yet far. Hanging there. chance. no, i'd damn sure rather detector nothing, seriously question?

Who said anything cheer about? Lol dont think Spain hides anything full democracy. 44k excess deaths lot almost 56% excess deaths unaccounted for. people would affected collapse health care system 20k. number likley corresponds covid deaths. see gov addresses this. write link gave.

Id rather given money all, least could changed course action figured something else out. feel like I've lost much, even tho people $5k worth pennies. 

I hope recieve benefits soon, paid full. Good luck. Ain‚Äôt laws drinking claws tho hospitals are, large, overrun right now. Take Texas, one states getting hit hard right example. Hospitalizations tending Texas lately well.

One could argue temporary lockdown Texas basis risk mitigation, ‚Äúflatten curve‚Äù point view, lockdowns states like NY wouldn‚Äôt make sense Attend college 55%. There's way 90 percent getting degrees. look graduation rates college. 

I never appreciated biology minor till virus..., basic health knowledge required knowledge body. say minus choices made health knowledge learn PE. learn body functions via body part. Even think teacher underpaid exceptional teaching. 

Now there's age limit school till 16 believe highschool required, literally get it. Also back grandma's parents days elementary school education standard. ( 29). means lot older folks far undereducated. 

This great divide problem long leaders face value decency. people like grandma, church people know believe. confused truth versus lies. trust to? problem isn't. I've got mine free last years without even showing ID. got keep ears open events, free flu shots regular occurrence community. Yes, mitigating efforts taking novel coronavirus also keep lot people getting flu. It'll super rare get wearing mask, keeping distant, washing hands, avoiding public places possible, etc. basically seriously fuck twice short timeframe.

Keep safe. That's point. thats thing virus asymptomatic presymptomatic cases. 50 patients bad, reality probably double that.

Just one missed thread ruin contact tracing, leaky borders that. mean, even super-rural areas (buddy lives south-dakota, according him, barren wasteland depression lol) need drive hour get ""City"" Walmart around, people tend hang maybe populated areas. Guess there's much else do, people tend social, least general sense.

That's one thing, I'm thankful mind thing, I'm used lot longer-distance friends. two people I'll hike maybe month, even we're extremely cautious sometimes skipped we're feeling iffy, notice lot cases going about. that, really much different me, still text/call week such, still normal thing since we're hanging all.

That said, social, extroverted people, know plenty really struggling this. seem able handle alone thoughts, throw caution wind still go out, meet people, etc, like grandmother. much hate see it, goes people least 4x week, groups 4-10, restaurants, golfing, people over. 

IMO, risk unimportant thing. Socializing important, grandmother's case, example, unnecessary, difference literally healthy possibly dying/long term health risks, something know she'll regret gets sick.

I agree though, suck someone actually making sacrifice, right thing staying home mostly, see others throw caution wind continue like nothing's wrong. shame, that's really reason we're still problems; people willing make personal sacrifices stay home need out. agreed second part, hurts see people I'm close going socializing, knowing one events/times could one gets infected, getting sick, also becoming part problem spreading others willing right thing. Yes CDC says best *hottest* sauce is. Shit don‚Äôt care yeah can‚Äôt imagine like year sign phases 2 3 study? I‚Äôm Italy metal head, concerts postponed 2021 way cases started spike, even if, technically, concerts allowed, live music clubs - real music, disco crap - haven‚Äôt reopened, yes, open discotheques, dance halls every single bar, of... reasons, apparently. center town last Friday evening, bars packed, inside outside, bunch idiots, wearing masks social distancing. 

It seems assholes already forgotten army trucks transporting dead people... three months ago something like 20 army trucks, full coffins, arrived area.

And another bunch cretins apparently couldn‚Äôt wait next year go waste time money holidays... rest world indeed astonished happening there. true. matter skin colour is, test positive go quarantine.

Edit: even NZ. shocker misinformation gets upvoted. Stupid say need self isolate unless experiencing symptoms. waitress tested positive asymptomatic ffs dad died stroke hopefully happen me. start though. poor treatment elderly start.

First disclaimer: talking mostly US. experience elder care places.

""You want kill Nana!"" current cliche less aggressive approach NPI (Non-Pharmaceutical Intervention).  Well *you* Nana? US traditionally wait becomes frail, spend bank account, get Medicaid, put home. (And don't, good you, I'm talking you. let's face it, elder care difficult norm.)

So large institutions full frail elderly. would thought infectious disease would affect elderly disproportionate rate? Well, actually anyone knowledge disease all. ignore that. chronic disease job, influenza sweeps regular basis clears rooms next batch. 

So say condescending view elderly putting way lightly. least couple generations.  Nana living home you, could determine whether visit, could entertain, could strap mask take park makes sense you.  living petri dish. probably situation mind isolation forced lockdown actually makes sense.  want fix that? Take home. Get apartment, take care yourself. Otherwise fact treat elderly slightly less well zoo animals.

Smart. following chain possible source infected goods. 

They already quarantine measures restricting shipping crews ships except loading unloading. There's plenty social distancing dockworkers time. 

However, port poses several complex issues.

Other infected crew, one issues wastewater runoff. someone ship past infected COVID-19 fecal matter contain virus. virus sheds large amounts via fecal matter. understanding one test performed bilge ship would conducting test everyone ship. 

Why infected crew member matter never disembark? numerous studies already show various infectious aerosols produced substantial quantities flushing. 

 

Aerosolization fecal infected matter near ice makers known produce environmental leaking air-ventilation valve mechanism resembles mode described outbreak SARS occurred Amoy Gardens housing block Hong Kong 2003 

 

Tracing chain important.

Turns time, learn help handle guess possible. is, however, valid excuse. bad UKs data getting, rest world bailing us right now, sure feel that.

&amp;#x200B;

Somehow even seem dropped 6th deaths per million, seems odd. graph says 7 day average... Either that's lie.. manipulating data. lockdown Finland less death, lower percentage economic decline neighbor Sweden lockdown, also stayed open Europeans travel reason, including vacations.



So staying open killing citizens save Sweden's economy!


I can't wait deniers keep denying. wonder million bs excuses toss around explain this.



But doctors scientists kept changing things...


 originally said: Stay home, socially distance, disenfect stuff, wash hands, sanitize hands.


 weeks later said should: Stay home, socially distance, disenfect stuff, wash hands, sanitize hands, and...... wear mask.


See, keep changing things, can't keep up!!


/s Good point - think gotta weigh mental health benefits people going restaurants somewhat ""normal"". Obviously nothing excess think moderation would OK. disagree that, shows virus kill many people country like US (the current US excess deaths 200k). would true countries likley tamper numbers? Making statment true? Currently Iran les covid deaths per capita Sweden. ch* na Vietnam too. believe numbers?


However compare Sweden neighbours yes numbers good one disagree that.

But saying Sweden one highest deaths per capita false compare numbers have. accurate numbers countries numbers make sense related covid. Don‚Äôt forget Patriot Act *taps temple* reading right ~""followed health department advice"" mandate masks? mean actually follow advice local health department telling people masks essential??? latter that's troubling entire community. wrong.

Well pandemic theater. ...8-12 month mark since major vaccine FDA approved brought market), that's effective group immunity rate \~25-40ish % depending much organic herd immunity we've already achieved then.

At lowest likely \~27.5% group immunity, effective R0 would least \~1.8125, \~32.5% group immunity R0 \~1.7. BEST CASE SCENARIO reduce contagiousness level around 1.5, worse case scenario even manages remain R0 = 2 even 50-60% effective vaccine, \~40% citizen consumption compliance, pre-existing 15% organic herd immunity.

Do idea many people die achieve 15% organic herd immunity? around \~50 million cases covid nearly \~1.6 million deaths, mention 10s millions citizens permanent medical complications kind due infection. even that, still (absolutely best case scenario) relatively \~2-3x infectious worst seasonal flus ever really have, instead least \~5x contagious normal flus like now.

Forced compliance possible way US ever achieve R0 value low enough even permit possibility living life way resembles used live...apart potential mass testing system using CRISPR technology gene-reacting reagent test strips meant rapid, &lt; 15-20 minute results self-testing kit produced format almost layperson effectively use. reason, US &amp; Western governments shied away tech compared early (this using rapid testing White House Feb/March), likely due comparatively inferior accuracy (like \~67-90% accuracy vs. \~97-99.9% PCR nasal swab tests). inferior accuracy actually matters, since product allows entire nation test even twice week every week (with 80-90% false-negative accuracy), combined forced, non-voluntary, perpetually supervised quarantine/isolation center infected (including like 80-100% wages covered point), regardless symptom status.

If Americans refuse what's necessary win, better prepare perpetually lose country long possibly \~2025-2026. Exactly. I'm way trying downplay severity virus, still need view practical manner. sense ""doom gloom"" ""fuck US"" tone, means we've gotten track. move anyone flu isolation ward put neg pressure room. get tested stay multiple negative tests.

I've swabbed 9 times now. poor nose give up. son flu RSV time 1.5 years old. pretty ugly, would‚Äôve likely much worse hadn‚Äôt flu shot. 

over past decade half, half phase 3 trial candidates end yielding &lt;50% immunity rates, even passed safety tests soundly established dosage range maintain safety level).

SARS-CoV-2 R0 value (very, conservative estimates here) \~2.2-3, keep mind R0 value ALREADY factoring massive ""abnormal"" societal/global changes social behavior, including partial mask usage, average hand hygiene, significant implementation social distancing/long-term ""sheltering place."" masks, large concerts, sports stadiums filled fans, etc., effective R0 could be/have been/will knows, maybe 2x bad worse (maybe R0 \~4.4-6? even more?). comparison, effective R0 original SARS outbreak SARS-CoV/SARS-CoV-1 \~0.67-1.23 (anything 1 even survive human population transmitted poorly). worst average half dozen common ""cold""/""flu"" viruses R0 approximately 1.3 worst. relative R0 1 (active virus case numbers going down, flat), Covid's estimated R0 \~2.5 whopping FIVE TIMES contagious communicable strains seasonal flus, mention literally 30 TIMES (30x) deadly worst common flu strains (if believe US cases &amp; death numbers accurate). Even total US infections much say \~100% (so twice many infections documented, crazy consideration since global data shows \~40% cases remain ENTIRELY asymptomatic, surely least \~10%+ total pre-symptomatic patients pre-determined incubation periods 6-7 days, meaning makes total sense randomized societal antibody testing major US cities shown positive antibody results within much like 4-10%+ entire population (4-10% \~330 million people, 13.2-33 million infections date data applicable less dense non-urban centers well), even though supposedly bit 5 million citizens infected now.

So even current \~3.2% average fatality rate (\~32x deadly worst common flus) significantly overstated due say one asymptomatic carrier going unnoticed (and largely uncounted since US testing culture really prioritize potential asymptomatic carriers) every case that's accurately reported, that's STILL mortality rate \~1.6%, SIXTEEN TIMES deadly flu per case basis (not even factoring \~5x relatively contagious,

So tl;dr, virus contagious (5x contagious normal seasonal flus relative R0 1, worst case R0 around 1.3 normal flus R0 average 2.5/an R0 range 2.2-3+ SARS-CoV-2), deadly (over 32x deadly typical flus, even US dense urban antibody data actually accurately reflects entire, less urban/dense country, mortality rate absolutely bare minimum still \~0.5%, 5x deadly normal flus), pervasive/stealthy (40%+ cases remain entirely asymptomatic, \~10-15%+ total cases pre-symptomatic whilst nearly 1 week even longer incubation period exposure symptom onset), incubation period WAAAAY LONG (over \~2.5x longer major strains influenza), logically leading roughly \~2.5x incidents crowd/public/anonymous exposure even factoring somewhat unprecedented presence quite deadly SARS-family virus somehow manages spread via entirely asymptomatic transmission least around \~40% total cases.

EVEN 67% entire population (which way, way optimistic btw; half whole country gets least one flu shot every two years, preliminary data suggests average IQ, average education level-holding citizen even ""suspicious"" major covid vaccines typical multi-strain seasonal flu vaccines, expected societal covid vaccine dosing compliance expected cap around \~30-40% within first 6-9 months industry reaching sufficient capacity vaccinate American wants it)...

...got vaccinated ""on schedule"" (meaning consuming doses 2/3 dose series, receiving booster doses timely manner), EVEN vaccine say 60% effective immunization rate, that's still effective present-day herd immunity rate \~40% excluding organically-achieved herd immunity (expected be, most, maybe \~10-20% entire society \~12-18 month's time now, depending data set use extrapolate). Even reach 20% organic herd immunity direct infection, well \~40% effective societal immunization (remember though, roughly \~50% 20% portion ""natural"" immunity holders likely even aware already getting vaccinated, stack direct combination. that's roughly like \~55% entire society effective immunization rate, absolute pipe dream, fantasy world best possible outcomes away way possible (plus some).

GUESS WHAT? R0 around 2.5, 55% actual societal immunization rate would still manage maintain R0 value around 1.375, contagious worst seasonal flus (think like Swine flu 2009-tier contagious). even R0 value 1.375 really capture opinion, largely current suspected R0 values based already significantly altered lifestyle choices group social behavior (more hand washing, partial mask wearing globally, much less regular travel distance, heavily reduced leisure-oriented public exposure, etc.). suspect seemingly successful SARS-CoV-2 vaccination program (where 67% society complies inoculation), people begin drastically reduce various R0-lowering social behaviors protects others.

So realistically, even solid, relatively safe vaccine candidate manages achieve \~50-55% immunization efficacy (say \~55% average, likely &lt; 60%, comparison, average year's multi-strain influenza vaccine boasts 40% immunization effectiveness year year year), even managed convince much 40% population receive inoculation (best educated guesses, based reputable entities completed basic trust-related polling, \~25-30% inoculation compliance rate within first 6 month available, capping around \~35-40% absolute maximum around the... too, truth told.

Migraines tummy troubles absolutely Covid-19 symptoms. 

Symptoms may appear 2-14 days exposure virus. People symptoms may COVID-19:

Fever chills

Cough

Shortness breath difficulty breathing

Fatigue

Muscle body aches

Headache

New loss taste smell

Sore throat

Congestion runny nose

Nausea vomiting

Diarrhea

Some people Covid may all, some, one none symptoms would definitely wary anyone digestive issues, seems common I've seen.

As far living situation goes, I'd definitely wear masks common areas make sure sleep separately, I'd also ask GF stay room sleeping much possible (no hanging living room, etc). 

Several days away would probably give enough time see symptomatic please remember someone asymptomatic still transmit disease. I'd suggest go get tested 5-7 days wedding (viral load would typically still low that, would lead false negative).

Obviously, safest solution would go - especially since one wearing masks - seems unsafe me.  Even financial support, depression rates/suicides gonna skyrocket people go whole winter, another spring, summer stuck inside. Still change Idaho votes.

Idaho leaders decision makers wants handle crisis. Stowaways? want take risk? Get shot. Someone getting shot mean going get infected (You've already vaccinated).

But that's literally untrue though, least multitude different vaccines various illnesses. Everyone who's medically/physically able (health wise) NEEDS take bare minimum dosage/dosing frequency required achieve likely personal immunity. absolutely simple ""don't want get sick? take shot yourself."" Loads different demographic groups, particularly at-risk groups, SAFELY RECEIVE many common vaccines. obvious examples include immunocompromised people (e.g. untreated/unmanageable HIV-1/HIV-2 viral loads effectively AIDS, possibly severe mismanaged Hepatitis C, formally diagnosed alchoholics bona fide hard drug addicts whether recovery/on different daily maintenance medication not), pregnant women, elderly many cases, (particularly elderly concerns related multiple comorbidity like asthma, obesity, hypertension, type-2 diabetes inflicting one person's body), already battling another chronic illness (particularly viral illnesses always easily treated, like HSV-2 MRSA.

I obviously agree world's public sector regulatory bodies utilize sort overarching metric measure/score/rate relative societal risk/negative health consequences indirectly result enough people receiving specific vaccine, vaccination protection respective corresponding virus/bacteria question. provide group examples, let's use Hep A/Hep B viruses corresponding ""dead"" IM injection vaccines (usually IM injection IM route vaccines actually ""attenuated"" aka weak live strains), comparing potential ""live"" attenuated/weakened vaccines (typically consumed orally). Typhoid might better example difference vaccination options, whatever.

Anyways, live weakened Typhoid vaccine usually seen much higher efficacy terms immunity (including long-term immunity beyond \~5-10+ years) compared ""dead"" inactivated IM injection version, particularly comes version produces effective immunity quickly. Despite oral ""live"" version Typhoid seeming like logical choice almost people whose physical health medical history likely handle it, seems reasonable ""allow"" people opt inactivated, ""dead"" version since also much, much less negative side effects (not side effects relatively even bad).

What's point? case (Typhoid), there's low risk option that's identified proven safe effective, almost effective live version. knowing that, see compulsory vaccination Typhoid vaccines (at least inactivated, ""dead"" forms) inherently bad dangerous thing (with medical exemptions course, assuming get say 2-3 unrelated doctors agree neutered version vaccine still somehow risk reward health).

Now comes something MUCH, MUCH dangerous, MUCH contagious, mean covid literally like \~96-98% DNA/RNA SARS, around \~2-6x deadly MUCH less contagious. Covid also crazy long incubation period compared similar coronavirus seasonal flus flus general (median average 5ish days exposure onset, 95% CI range \~4-5.5.8 days so), alarmingly high estimated R0 value (""contagiousness""value/score: example R0 value 10 would mean that, average, every person gets infected, regardless symptom severity, would go infect 10 people, least average. 10 would directly infect 100, 100 directly infect 1,000, etc., roughly every time cycle, cycle duration roughly median incubation period symptoms onset) compared normal flus.

The average incubation period majority popular Influenza strains 1-4 days, average \~2 days (so covid \~2.5 longer incubation period allow pre-symptomatic exposure onward transmission). Combine nearly half people get ever even getting symptoms, can't plain allow uneducated masses play ""pretend expert"" based much factor feelings, emotions, non-data, non-science based pseudo-logic (that based total BS journal article \~15-20+ years ago indirectly implied causation autism children via insisting evidence least loose correlation two variables...a specific vaccine autism).

Combine straight unhelpful coincidences caused wholly misguided assertions (e.g. one family member coincidentally exposed strain Influenza days duo/trio/quad variant vaccine included expected strain influenza, eventually falls ill, incorrectly building causal relationship getting vaccinated perceived risk infected virus via vaccine innoculation (not true, least nearly vaccines produced today last \~10 years, including seasonal flu vaccines), we're putting next decade nation's medical health hands essentially medically scientifically illiterate within society.

We guarantee that, even get safe vaccine, particularly high efficacy (actual % effectiveness per patient creating immunity entire duration coverage duration insisted manufacturer). People seem blindly hope/assume/choose believe major 2-3 big versions US-sponsored covid vaccines somehow \~70-90%+ effective right bat. look CDC's result average % efficacy terms vaccine immunity-causing effectiveness seasonal influenza instance, notice 2004-2020 (first year start collecting data), average vaccine effectiveness 39.875% averaged across 16 years! Roughly \~2/3rds current covid trial vaccines like unable appropriately pass phase 3 concrete evidence safety, sufficient efficacy (has \~50%+ chance building effective immunity get US gov't approval, indirectly based vaccine trial data unrelated virus families  Absolutely fair enough. Ain't stopped far. vegans bringing veganism dead horse but.... seriously dude? Yeah, what? one seems care /s Judging history, yeah kinda. 

I understand people would come sub hate Fauci, find completely unrelated posts complain sorts subs. Get help, kind obsession someone healthy.  we‚Äôre going substitute actual data feelings. I‚Äôm doubting numbers off, also one making made bullshit either. That's... Odd. Seems specifically targeted. guess could understand banning heavily populated metro areas, seems heavy handed. bike racing season less cancelled, I'm trying use extra season time focus weight routines interval work bike. Hopefully find something similar keep body busy! Choke hairy balls Sure may lasting immunity, guess else might also lasting.. multi-system inflammatory syndrome, stroke deficits, organ failure, neuropsych conditions like depression, anxiety, memory loss.

\^ statements doctors article, studies anything.. well. Emergence cult like groups act suicidally common symptom collapsing empires. Considering half people probably get vaccine, might take longer truly get back normal. Well, unless ""normal"" includes losing thousands people COVID-19 annually. said couple weeks ago. Nothing normal vaccine approved, distribution figured out, Americans save enough money afford it, actually able get it, finally get it. Actually, 2022 may optimistic.

It's important realize two things:

1. grand scheme things, obesity low end risks virus. healthy, need take proper precautions really comes play associated comorbities like diabetes, atherosclerosis, hypertension, etc. Obesity nature like risk multiplier comorbidities severity. 

2. overweight, obese, yet developed diseases associated metabolic dysfunction, take action now. overhaul diet starting exercise routine show vast improvements overall health sometimes less two months. still obese, body begin heal, correct hormone dysfunction, inflammation go dramatically. late start begin protecting healing time fall winter. worst part is, saw coming.

I fucking hate everyone now. I'm embarrassed call American shitty controlling virus been. pretty sad really. No, Spain people smoking restaurant bars outdoors, smoking linked spreading Coronavirus. No. Schools opening weather getting colder many parts country, means spend time indoors likely spread. people want wear masks That‚Äôs thing...

In situation NZ testing high rates people whole 102 day period including random testing healthy people vulnerable communities without single positive. People power anything stay power. Trump prime example. leave willingly . Question scientists- since similar symptoms, infected flu virus mean Coronavirus can‚Äôt invade cells? reliable, better nothing properly administered easy implement. Yeah get that.. it‚Äôs maddening people dying 10‚Äôs thousands he‚Äôs swanning around playing golf *fuck everyone else* Social distancing masks mitigation measures. learned week 4 popular mask types borderline useless even harmful. overreacted, bought lies flattening curve would result fewer deaths, robbed people livelihoods, locked solitary confinement end sight, wrecked supply lines, cost jobs destroyed economy, loaded huge financial burdens future generations likely come, saved lives, people dying, COVID, CDC many state governments promising measures taken save lives truth is, delaying deaths COVID-19 short months best. Everyone works died COVID-19 still die COVID-19 unless kill first!

The whole 'flattening curve' keep healthcare facilities overrun, save lives! realize that, everything else starts coming focus begin understand we've ROYALLY screwed ourselves. Yeah hear you. I‚Äôm giving fellow Americans way much credit assumptions. tragedy. Absolutely Nah, PSL already vote. happened 323 million US citizens last 8 months ? Higher Education needed wake-up call awhile outrageous price tags lack concern customers.....the students. worked college, students never primary concern. Powerful donors, tuition money, reputation come students. care seem mind risking lives customers employees means keep high paying salaries. Judicial Council California Thursday voted end statewide eviction moratorium next month, reopening courts landlords pressuring Gov. Gavin Newsom lawmakers address potential housing crisis.  allowed process evictions midnight, Sept. 1, although patchwork 100 local laws could prevent delinquent tenants displaced. Bay Area counties cities passed renter protections coronavirus pandemic, although [many scheduled expire Interesting numbers here. Maybe that's I'm concerned. county currently recovery rate 75% (as yesterday). number holds entire county ends infected, that's abt 125,000 ppl recover. would help least tried act like gave shit. understand this. wife work two school age children toddler. wealthy. guess would bottom middle class. work management essentially retail like businesses. Maybe better people area still comfortable. 

Something needs done unemployment asap I'm tired hearing Republicans rhetoric. admit rural location made money unemployment working. I'm back work though hours like were. future bleak specifically industry want honest myself. paychecks pre-COVID. I'm highest paid guy building going feel stuffed back unemployment dries up. can't imagine minimum wage people feeling.

So yes system failing everybody every level right now. leadership. inspiration. plan. compassion. change. hope. 

I know anymore. political ideals beliefs evolved life god anyone ok things right now. I'm sad see neighbors fellow Americans around abandon integrity rationale follow creepy con man turned aspiring populist demagogue. problem COVID-19 already endemic community. 3,055 cases per million. They're already 1/7th infected New York, curve getting started.

It's going make much difference point whether tourism allowed not. delayed first wave significantly, they're going end place rest us. Get streets. Block traffic. Make fucking noise CLL ‚Äî Chronic lymphocytic leukemia, type cancer blood bone marrow. 

tl;dr: best patients prevented costs catching Covid prognosis good. would diverting hospitalization counting away CDC change many positive tests states report? insanely frustrating us taking seriously, keep waiting waiting nothing. Plus time goes harder harder get spread everywhere now. thought cases started spiking July would lockdowns, instead places like FL governor forcing everyone go back school. teachers left teach. Wow would think house isnt vacation......again. Meanwhile rest world pretty much recovered pandemic. Trump republicans completely failed I‚Äôd say guilty negligent homicide hundreds thousands people. Exactly. Even Biden gets elect probably won‚Äôt feel effects months later that‚Äôs better plan Trump. backpacks going go bad sitting storage presumably growing kids need new clothing anyway, time year many people buy new set fall winter cloths, say let be. Even maintenance guy truly medical reason able wear mask, mean put people risk.....and living space boot; absolutely absurd. hope mom able get quickly resolved. Good standing herself. Stay safe! Good thing school decided combine 2 classes we‚Äôll 30 people small classroom mask mandate. makes opportunity it‚Äôll work out...  masks work... shouldn‚Äôt true imo. anyone goes there, live Maryland, serious, wear one wherever go public. I‚Äôm sarcastic mocking masks. legit think work... see less flu normal, less colds normal, etc. right? Insurance companies successful regulatory capture long ago. Germany shining example medical management Europe. Earlier year taking Covid patients overflow hospitals neighboring countries.

Comparing US Germany hard due size government differences. US better compares entire EU since states manage similar European countries. states invest education healthcare others focus supply side economics. Everything show. None measures taken prevent school shootings worked politicians refused take one measure proven work countries. None measures taken prevent COVID schools work politicians refused take measures proven work countries. article, 53% said ""inadequate response federal government"" reason, 23% think minor reason, 23% think reason.

Get ready 4 years! hard possibly convince teenage boys rub dicks shower? I'm friends someone cut kid, pissed it. Rightly opinion im sorry development shows danger challenge virus, Brazil cant anything prevent this.  pretty sure more

Dems: ""I got stupid idea""
Republicans: ""While got stupider idea""

You guys love racing bottom see who. Never realizing competition, rest us stand sidelines horror. 

Either way best get ready refugee camps border soon death cultist Slow stupid racist. politicians choose still bribed actively would best voters bribers want. Democracy sold highest bidder. thing left point pay buyers. Two reasons can't true. One, R0 rate simply high remain invisible 102 days high rate testing NZ. Someone would tested positive now. Also first two days since first positive test wave two people hospitalised virus. floating around time someone would ended doctor's office least. 

Secondly genome sequence shown new strain never seen NZ before, meaning could floating around time. Ah yes thanks reminding exit polls! exit polls regularly blow past UN marker indicating electoral fraud. far Elizabeth Warren goes honestly never expected much saw spoiler.

Edit correct typo Every single time think virus can't get worse, somehow seems get worse, almost like thing happened end becoming perfect thing wipe humanity. suppose Stephen King onto something wrote Stand. Username unfortunately checks out. super spreaders mitigated regulations, behavioral changes, mask usage, etc...we cant neglect like cant neglect herd immunity playing role. Except Trump way dumb become Emperor himself. love I'm getting ads ""back school shopping""
Yeah I'll go buy denim school. Nice! Keep up. Chicken, onions, peppers stir fried really helped lose weight. Onions peppers low calories yet found surprisingly filling. /s?

New Zealand seeing new cases idea how. able deny request time like job Washoe ain‚Äôt red

And local government could something we‚Äôve allowed short term rentals continue. real local businesses closed since March, don‚Äôt rely tourism like hotel operators (and lakeside inn gone local operators anyway, staff live outside basin too). see mostly young people wearing masks live. Might something living college town(educated people tend wear masks) see many people 50+ wearing them. rednecks definitely wearing them. Yes. Slightly, dropping.

If theory cases weren‚Äôt really declining true, would seeing positive test rate shoot up, isn‚Äôt. 

People got complacent June, cases went up, people realized error governments refined rules (closing bars, adding mask mandates) cases going again. It‚Äôs mysterious plot. first-hand experience tells people know get two viruses once, think viruses actually contagious. They're minority, dumb fucks there. probably heavily involved policy making. soon electricity I'm this... üò≠ Aww don‚Äôt like that! I‚Äôm big fan r/coronavirus the...erm...consistency common sense. want know mad today... Mail Ballots? think whats makes virus almost impossible isolate. survives allot surfaces. wood, carton, also frozen products. well worded. correct numbers wrote probably posted article since misleading.  I‚Äôm Georgia Bulldog fan, built this. No, see, he‚Äôs instructed delay fear-mongering get closer election season, taking measures keep virus spreading. Yeah, he‚Äôs center left social democrat best. Unfortunately, confuses issue referring ‚Äúsocialist.‚Äù shit. I'll live crazy another day. already is. needed hospital bed cold (I hate dysfunctional body) took ten hours four hospitals find one. Yes nature default, mutations generally weaker. Stronger virus mutations end killing host. Weaker mutations subsist. think don‚Äôt understand, logic would point living first place. Oklahoma early voting.  I've never lived Oklahoma, state, early voting fewer polling places, fairly big crowd, even though spread time. Still, possible find time lines long. people flexible schedules vote off- peak hours, give space others. Sorry forgot say: serious one Perception reality. doctor want obsess it. Fear mongering finest yes, flu virus. else?? I‚Äôm waiting day pass New York. can‚Äôt say ‚Äúbut look death rate!‚Äù anymore know, change reporting done diverting hospitalizations away CDC I'm midst everything. mean already state lacrosse tourney last weekend town. fools anything become statistic. That's 100% what's happening. Teachers retired early summer, quit, national shortage substitute teachers. descending actual fascism part idiots like you. same. 29 became 2 k next 3 weeks  already died inside pandemic. I'm like callus foot someone who's worked feet 50 years. getting rid without machete. im untouchable! wish could quit working weeks time still paid People can‚Äôt even pick presidential nominees anymore without rigged congress shown little power last months compared president.

We‚Äôre puppet country run corporations Trump gets one general side might control army even loses Electors nailed one back... That‚Äôs do. drink Covid. get house order? one Trump‚Äôs appointed rats who‚Äôs jumping ship. Plenty women prefer dicks come ribbed pleasure. even didn't, sexual preferences women good reason take pointy objects begin hacking away kids body far young consent Summer? told April!

Edit: damn downvoted asking question. sub cool. Canada checking (BC) - government run insurance agency automobiles (ICBC) - $310 / month 2013 truck w/ 150k km $2M liablity, collision comprehensive. know people paying close $400 / month newer vehicles.

This CAD BTW recently mine went 100%, nearly heart attack. I'm less worried catching worried knock-on effects COVID symptoms mirroring flu. I'm essential employee, luckily managed keep job throughout. think households already stretched thin, potential self-quarantine multiple times matter months, roommate/child/husband/wife/sister/whatever starts displaying symptoms we're (the US) still waiting week COVID test results. staggered illnesses could easily ruin family 4 financial standpoint, let alone actually contract COVID. suggestion make get flu vax early, going bad winter don't. don‚Äôt want actually take steps curb transmission. It‚Äôs pain I‚Äôm fond masks staying home either it‚Äôs needs happen. Half-ass efforts yielding half-ass results. think point made 600k cases = bad. could population size China 600k cases still bad. one prepared. It‚Äôs incompetence figure out. Stop listening cdc fundamental universal component language. They/them recognized dictionary correct gender pronouns. making choice reject normal language take extreme position way reflect normal societal beliefs. Transgender third genders existed thousands years across cultures world. 

Americans support transgender rights 2-1 margin. claiming one enforcing ""normal"" belief objectively still responded saying can't refer people non-preferred gender pronouns compelled speech. I've asked question twice yet able come response. fair point assume claim compelled speech logical explanation?

The idea gender ""hard coded DNA"" nonsense well. six different chromosome combinations produce living humans.

So summarize - nothing saying logical. coming place extreme transphobia way reflects normal societal beliefs reality. Sorry, facts care feelings. you‚Äôll see conservative twitter saying ‚Äúwe‚Äôve done everything could!‚Äù. It‚Äôs pretty pathetic viewpoint Americans. wish country would stop embarrassment rest world behave. Dude goes billionaire dinner parties laughs entire viewing audience above.  either currently locked lockdown?  quite disturbing seeing US melt down. Like, people access water? *is* literally third world country shit... can‚Äôt wait November virus over

Why November? elections? another year shit?? Patriots going take him. Brady 8 players sitting season, including multiple starters, means horrible year. dunno actually would cause alarm.

2 words: toiletpaper think rely teammates different building teamwork skills. baseball player rely teammates win game don‚Äôt order hit home run. experience, one teammate better rest, tend start yelling others blaming others losing, exactly great teamwork skills. 

As hard work discipline, sports require real practice discipline achieve success. However, skills usually translate useful pursuits. easy someone able practice 6 hours football still study tests. Hard work sports translate hard work pursuits. ...right. That's praising commenter defending paying onlyfans subscriptions instead using ""free"" porn.  ProTeSts that, especially counties acting 1:1 tech students Chromebooks didn‚Äôt come yet. definitely want elected officials people select them.

Having Electoral College choose president, instead people choose president, gave us Bush 43 trump. choices disasters America. people choose president would dramatically better. mate works Mouse... worry lot people complaining mask usage, still.

Another thing; heard inverse-karen yesterday... one complaining masks smoke, blaming afternoon rush local dairy queen mask mandate get food fast enough. chuckled, carried smokes, shaking head. admit, taste good that. Retirement homes leaving Fox News Rec Room, that‚Äôs all. What‚Äôs got current subject? Stupid Holy shit people actually believe fatality rate high.... yikes.

Take pandemic seriously, don‚Äôt exaggerate facts. I've TSA (or local variants) 11 different places (1x Middle East, 9x EU, 1x USA), take shoes one time USA (LAS).

Around world might overstatement. Oh ok, great news then. go America! Keep good work! masks? /s  Trudeau's wife caught early on, took seriously afterwards. can‚Äôt stay 6 feet apart school. schools would able 6-8 people classroom. That‚Äôs going happen. school started last week kids sitting 3 bus seat playing recess without mask. already received letter stating someone class tested positive. definitely aren‚Äôt 6 feet recess. Unfortunately fact wear masks day except breakfast, lunch, recess probably many school districts do. black women attacking black girl cops dont care? much ""Toronto Good"".

Strip clubs? pandemic? even allowed open? Celebrate life cut short stupid people care sister's safety well-being... clearly something me, outrage, fury feel, I'm even related. deserved live. know thing her, know much.  post history, brother, mine. sure, keep lying.

Don't mind

There ways police speeding (cameras mailed tickets). already drug courts, need invest treatment sentence people treatment reasonable option, already used can't take advantage poor (rehab free, even low cost rehabs reach poor). problem police jobs, complain this, reason jobs take large amount budget, there's money left anyone else anything. He's pretty tough. know he's managed past 20 years. think could.The mood swings huge problem, nice person even starting them.

My husband goes Sturgis every year, year. Even wanted stay completely outdoors, it'd hard stay safe. virus survive surfaces days afaik. believe longer. But, I'm pessimistic today. many people actively fighting it. mean, like fucking mission. Maybe think thing they'll ever matters, dunno.

I'm tired it. wanna go out. Maybe meet girl something. make difference. Beat re: TSA know many people live like outside pandemic? Get grip. sounds like don‚Äôt really understanding many people US always lived $25k per year. 

This unlike anything ever faced. It‚Äôs bunch BS think ppl won‚Äôt affected. it‚Äôs bad think everyone get free ride. Go read revolutions. There‚Äôs lot everybody killing everybody else suspect people prepared actually deal with. I‚Äôm interested political movements save lives myself. FWIW, article talking Tuesday Wednesday   unfortunate time ought calling removal. He's actively calling violence I'm same. normal rise grind first time felt alive felt like 10 years. I'd felt like worthless zombie bowing Man long, break beyond needed. wish far longer though I've back normal work since May. Sadly, think he's far popular cable host News Channel host Tucker Carlson closed television‚Äôs second quarter one record books: Tucker Carlson Tonight finished quarter highest-rated program cable news first time since show‚Äôs launch, delivering average total audience 4.331 million viewers. process, Carlson broke record held colleague, Sean Hannity, highest-rated quarter cable news  Still plenty self centered dumbasses. Listen maggots, room one sad sack potatoes me! notify next kin beautiful, intelligent, worthy affection! could smother sweet nothings, cart push itself! Signing beautiful bastards problem things help least little bit, two important things (avoiding poorly ventilated indoor spaces, social distancing) also worst business many different industries. we‚Äôre allowing business owners take temperatures clean furiously, there‚Äôs really way make safe people indoors even they‚Äôre wearing masks. Right wing media kinds problem. requires absolute idiot can‚Äôt consider two potential solutions problem. charitable, requires either don‚Äôt understand government actually works don‚Äôt believe specific points history.

We‚Äôve got lot busted ass people country. returned home one Central Park playgrounds West side park. shocked see many adults wearing masks. Majority children didn‚Äôt either. odd see people mask, today, masks stood out. Wrong direction people! People getting laid back need remain vigilant. 
Also, forget social distancing. sitting side side masks benches! first fall that, fall coming first often hot unless riding day, inside. big hot spot Deadwood, everything indoors there. music venues outside packed in, others indoors. Luckily, many bands cancelled, I'm hoping people mostly got drunk camp sites/RVs. We'll see, guess. Technically many camp sites, bringing booze rules, encourages people go bars/event venues. Hey. family Idaho protected Savior, HIMSELF! *Sigh.* course flagged removal. Censor everything agree with. Large parts US use air conditioning religiously fairly unique aside rich MENA country's.

We certainly know spreads far easier indoors many southern parts US nice enough weather need stay inside. Oh good, I‚Äôm glad salmonella. 

That‚Äôs sentence meant kindly 2020 That's exactly wwhati said ok Yeah, one dumb stories pushing conspiracy theories trying get people believe global pandemic hoax.  I‚Äôll much open comparing risks taking thing control, right it‚Äôs pretty much running rampant. Hard even consider arguments post time that, know mean? think criminal play rules still hope proper thing even sort shit unimaginable blatantly corrupt cruel blame people. 

Some countries implode corrupt leaders new beginning. there's that. Beach party! european, counter-intuitive homeschooling even legal. He's right entire time, know based Facebook/Social Media medical experts say. truly understand people believe everything see social media refuse believe actual experts telling them. deserve everything that's happening us, that's sad. think least three months. new long term data.  told would simply go away election??? call stand line day, shoulder shoulder Covid flu cases, voting. headline makes sound like protection lasts 3 months follow link CDC website says all. People tested positive COVID-19 need quarantine get tested 3 months long develop symptoms again. People develop symptoms within 3 months first bout COVID-19 may need tested cause identified symptoms. You‚Äôd think 6 months seeing covid people wouldn‚Äôt think hoax dEAtHs fAkE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  scientists saying ""we need take radical action immediately avert climate catastrophe"" Dems saying ""no don't"". 


They're ignoring mounds scientific evidence suit agenda. That's anti-science. Thank you, honestly never knew that. TIL. üòÄ probably kill people, like Putin kills journalists poison. new case numbers stay low extended period time, indicating pandemic over.

Expect wearing mask mid-Spring 2021 earliest. Welcome reddit, toddler. look USA like they're playing Plague Inc easy mode.

Countries like Germany, Taiwan New Zealand playing hard mode.

Unfortunately game want play real people get hurt die. wear mask I'm hoping lessen viral load, possibly help lessen others' load well. actually good? HellifIknow. keep wearing them, anyway. Looks like already decided own. Good thing pay bunch every year look us!

I didn‚Äôt mean sense COVID specifically however. can't believe 50 year old frat boy audience. Yea probably though asking randos questions infectious disease experts qualified answer? Would poll country try figure dark matter is? Yeah, exactly. parties suck, end day, least *some* faith Dems least trying good general population.  entirely possible covid still active NZ 100+ days, perhaps even couple asymptomatic people slowly pass around another, another person thinks cold, etc

The strain thats causing outbreak Auckland new strain confirmed genome testing never seen NZ means silently spreading 100 days without COVID. family getting death threats highly politically unstable atmosphere amidst economic collapse pandemic, fucking POTUS, powerful man world, works for, handling whole situation sides mouth, egging narrative positions Fauci takes public health line positions supposedly political hoax democrats deliberately collapse economy scaremonger failure adequately respond severity pandemic make Trump look bad lose election? kind perspective trying put situation here? Hehehe. go border, tell Mexican border guards going Alaska. There's plenty veterans feel exact opposite. Yeah you‚Äôre right much high get going profile lol? pathetic really interesting informative, thank you!

Question. may ridiculous possible find people willing participate trial agree isolated somewhere 14 days studied studying? resources lacking?

I don‚Äôt know sounds absurd not. I‚Äôm legitimately curious works behind scenes. caught March catch anytime June? I‚Äôm sure. preventative measures apply keeping Covid cases also impact colds/flus transmission. I‚Äôve read Southern Hemisphere (which currently winter) reported pretty dramatic reduction flu cases due Covid restrictions. Seems like another fear mongering news title taunting bunch ‚Äúwhat if‚Äù scenarios. Yeah. Summer easy part look bad been. earth time ""less government""? 

Do seriously think pandemic would going better government ""just got way""? explain dry sinus connection? one person's interests weighted fifty times another person's interests simply surrounded empty land equal say. wish I‚Äôll child, told hoped personally got chicken pox child immune.

[But comparing recent totals deaths causes provide complete picture pandemic‚Äôs impact tracking deaths people confirmed diagnoses. **Epidemiologists refer fatalities gap observed normal numbers deaths ‚Äúexcess nursing homes like that. Staff come PPE. ones come found corpses,

Yeah similar situation Canada. sent infected seniors back homes, prevented ones moved hospitals. leave space flood Covid patients never happened Canada. Somehow thought best place keep infected senior building bunch healthy ones. Brilliant! could even rented camper van something separate them. even built field hospitals stayed unused! many people killed needlessly criminal policy. makes mad. many people didnt need die. 82% deaths seniors homes. .. dunno .. *moved* infected seniors much fewer deaths would dug giant ditch deal bodies Hart Island.

I thought Potters Field kind famous mass cemetery poor homeless people? [Arent trenches always getting  hope so. still confirmed obviously! studies coming pointing way.

Not twisting anything said. wanting death specific location due bias towards certain group people.

You said it‚Äôs population control towards Hollywood, Hollywood population. 61k. directed towards ‚Äúthe elite.‚Äù

Your words, bias. Well, wrong, think eventually whomever survives fix problem.

It may end situation everyone gets disease, millions die, survivors know long take done pandemic. need ramp killer cells antibodies. exposed immune system without antibodies needs reinfected cells ramp production. arguing system unfair broken. saying possible break through

Then actually arguing? saying possible ""break through.""

&amp;#x200B;

Do think equally possible everyone position break through? think people position put equal amounts work thrown faces? think ever caught lucky break?

&amp;#x200B;

I honestly understand going here. mean, good individual situation, guess? think know lyme disease False negatives also thing NY cant it, one What's fucked parties suck! one sucks whole hecking lot lot scarier ways. So, gotta rally behind politicians suck usual amount kind ignore suck get people suck much more. Yes normally keep circulating- think many times ill, antigens going time illnesses. initial reaction, memory cells quickly identify begin replicating antigens disease found. provides much quicker response immune system initial infection. I'm remembering like undergrad immunology course I'm sure complicated this, think basic summary. work. Social distance works. Cleaning works. Temp checks work. None them, itself, likely enough.  together, work better one works individually.

But first two much effective (and efficient) last two, ""work"" themselves. cannot said cleaning checking temps. ""let self-sedate weed"" - Dems Til virus 60 dead. Imagine finally turning legal age STILL get criticized partying night away global health crisis. That‚Äôs gotta hurt. that's really good news.. hope lasts get back old normal.. I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôll grateful white-splain them. reason many people ‚Äúsee racism everywhere‚Äù encounter frequently. Maybe it‚Äôs fine policy, **your messaging sucks.**. that‚Äôs important policy itself, expect people follow it. find source case, influenza research.

Anyway, source probably two foremost clinician/virology researchers 1918 pandemic. plenty pop myths spread far wide virus. Here's two respect pathogenicity, great importance experimental studies 1918 modern waterfowl chimeric viruses, contemporary waterfowl H1 gene segments confer degree extreme pathogenicity 1918 pandemic H1. Thus, population immunity H1 ever drops significantly, H1 pandemic deadly 1918 might well result, suggesting also indefinite maintenance population H1 immunity may important component pandemic prevention. Inherent avian H1 pathogenicity also argues another popular myth, 1918 virus acquired pathogenicity evolving humans pandemic (e.g., initially milder ‚Äúherald waves‚Äù). Yet another myth 1918 severity somehow related disruptions World War I.

By 1918 virus final pandemic form. ""become"" deadly. Avian H1 viruses pathogenic. truth really frightening. would highly suggest edit original comment correct misinformation spread knowledge! solution homelessness implemented paid CA, even though homeless people Wyoming. Fuck homeless people, guess. also fuck homeless American part less popular state, right? point?

Besides argument healthcare incredibly short sighted, need argue small state Wyoming stand way everyone CA getting healthcare.

You're arguing tyranny minority fess it. Random asshole reddit warns ""CDC director full shit"". Fall covid deaths lower summer, flu spread easily people extra vigilant due covid. perhaps mildest flu season record. 

Remindme! December 1 25% respect Fauci calling Tucker out. Fuck it, stop now? makes think I‚Äôm not? work healthcare joke coworkers dramatic sympathy months ago long gone. Americans got bored pretending care I‚Äôm back yelled problems stemming hospitals covid procedures. ‚ÄúThings tricky lately, apologize‚Äù used work great don‚Äôt want hear it. 

So fucking tired leaving house, riding train, sitting close contact coworkers everyday treated like garbage paid comparably friends unemployment. 100% gets worse. Medical workers family go home try distance family. best case someone lends trailer park driveway safely distance still close family. Yeah! T-cell immunity seems present. people adaptive immune system (antibodies) fight virus. Others inate immune system able kick virus (T-cell memory). people push ""you 100000% reinfected"" ""you one billion chance ever ever lasting symptoms"" sh-it? Worst sub I've ever seen. shit time testing shows 10% f'd ass. entire point call option price pay get something known advance, value getting choose use option not, seems like bad simile since people idea take achieve happiness people get universally agree great.

And story featuring sword damocles guy wanted see like king realized wealth power came expense constantly danger. Sounds way like living American one guy without mask sneezing could mean going bankrupt hospital bills death living NZ. relevant. Correct. need add states get 50%. Combine top 11 states population, 50% population. Top 15 states 65% total population.

Ultimately, states whole need say levels, else what's point, might well one federal union.  Normally respond response three month old post, polite respectful thought deserved reply.

First, said elected leader started bragging it. bragging part, observation number tests performed relation countries. many said US testing.

Now, US performed many tests, effectively worthless due delay results. hey, testing wasting millions it. can't anything till November.

Finally, ""we"". country, culture race judged inadequacy weakest among them. I'm pretty sure country want judged merits mental acuity language skills. slow, brainwashed.  way things going seems like strong push government much something district doing. District basically parrots whatever comes government. know they're agreement wanting rock boat. Harley Davidson ever sanction things? Harley owners 1%ers. Yeeeaaaaaaahhhhhh boiiiiiiiiiiii  know, 17,000 regular Sturgis attendees may died coronavirus past year.   guy going around telling people reproduce religious belief telling end near. People upvoting comment. really shows entire subreddit feeds catastrophism want world collapse. movie theater patrons die, death rates mysteriously go overall, unfortunate coincidence.  :-( went cafeteria? Empire. many states counties around world reached nearing herd immunity, unlikely virus trouble us fall. death toll 100th percent, virus never going give us much trouble politics would. People definitely connected dots. problem everyone would rather save $1.50 taxes even means watching infrastructure collapse beneath feet. education every issue plaguing country. Starve system, watch system collapse. Pretty simple stuff. sure impetus change. Without pandemic, gf would've content long-distance relationship indefinitely, since I'm Canadian American, able see six months, we've devised way get married couple weeks finally together. Fortunately, we've talked much phone period we're sure we're right thing, it'll improve lives considerably.  FDOH says 70K. number different? testing bulletproof, especially asymptomatic people. 

""On day 1 infection, test [completely detecting virus, day 8 infection test produces false negatives 20 per cent time"" u fuck way ur bullshit take ur chart shove it

Oh man.. perfect summary exactly what's going minds 1/3 idiots inhabit earth.. know is. true! 

I live Montana tourist season much busier years. businesses try get patrons wear masks, people told stupid can't get COVID Montana! almost cases damn tourists showed around 4th July weekend!!!! College students assiduously following public health guidelines say ain't so! almost campus reopening plans made people who've never actually around college students pre-ordained fail. many insidious ways make money, salary. Many come senator/representative far wealthy went in. all. Russia basically skipping phase three trials using population. Lol Yeah uncle used rant Big Brother CA started passing nonsmoking laws. got terminal lung cancer saw wisdom quitting. Unfortunately late. many Americans care problem happens them. empathy.

Nice! go night ride soon escape Texas heat. honest also waves hit Italy Spain seeds late February which, least Northern Italy France temperatures around 0 celsius Yes, sure are....dead grandmas far eyes see. skipping ceremony catch outdoor reception mask. feel bad ceremony

I told actual ceremony wedding, tried talk everyone reception point, think anything worry about.

I think 5-6 days enough time see anyone event symptoms. course, already showing some, pretty much throws plan away. would force ""volunteering"" without compensation. That's clear sign think wants come first others. would force ""volunteering"" situation many people, little space. sense right comes first. else would describe person? Okay so, ""I'm idiot, social experiment"" we're going with? Hummm maybe something rhymes resmublicans? Concerts festivals last thing happening right are!

Wishing best school year home! never figure angle dude seems like they're worried group people wont quarantine agree, scientifically illiterate doesn‚Äôt make sense.

That accurate. Even cheap N95-valved masks offer significant outward protection:

Because plus coronavirus worse wanna live Why? provided evidence. rolls quickly? percentage (I‚Äôve seen estimates 10 - 30%) people myocarditis ongoing problems end ultimately getting heart transplant years later dying it.

I virus 2 years ago heart meds rest life. That‚Äôs best case scenario. mean, whatever... worst summer worst spring well? year already fucked, see point saying thing 15 different ways every week. already point there's people either take seriously, don't, CDC director changing mind ones don't. funny(not) countries afford masks already control. I'm sorry basic reading comprehension lost you.  that‚Äôs microchip one... Flower power! science, exactly, contradicts anything that‚Äôs said far? Damnit, take upvote. first detected death U.S. February 6. we're almost exactly 6 months in.

If people die rate two years, we'll 668K dead. we're almost exactly track.

Of course, 3x population 1928. Washington state requires 300 square feet distancing per indoor gym patron, bowling closed 2021 lol guys lonely. inside hole pandemic. CDC lost credibility months ago, don‚Äôt data support position confidence narrative things getting better approach election. 

There‚Äôs reason buried larger press release. people refuse listen much else do. Say peace, protect yourself, stand back.....People people even related. I'm sure work. stern warning. Yeah, slightly different situation stopped visiting parents beginning quarantine mom still recovering breast cancer treatment assumed immunocompromised.

It‚Äôs hard understand horrific autoimmune issues unless you‚Äôve dealt one. Yeah that's turn lizard Things bad right coronavirus situation Americans definitely soul capable working together accomplish many things. Please don‚Äôt let current struggles (which blame leadership) get Americans altogether. Sure, many videos people assholes day day people interact ‚Äî neighbors, service staff, teachers, etc ‚Äî incredible people.

We‚Äôre amazing people we‚Äôre led right direction. Unfortunately, current leader used issue divide us rather unite us. Rather leading us toward common goal muddied waters disinfo downplaying real threats. 

Don‚Äôt blame Americans happening. Blame him. Let‚Äôs hold asshole accountable rather blaming other. different leadership, would lot less people acting like selfish idiots right now. lot less. mj cures everything according potheads, wrong.   wish true. really do. haha. can't believe actually people believe first option, are. arguing one last month. states need person university. 

Me either. know people talked connections people make college. made connections people Reddit live half-way around world.

i asthma hbp i‚Äôm looking forward dying semester. citizens Shelby County making decisions. republican running health department, appointed republican, answering republican governor, overwhelmingly republican state senate/house, republican Senator almost republican house members. Virtually entire government Tennessee dominated republicans exceptions. really think going everything Democrats county stand political? Wow, even pre print, pre finishing study. peer review, nothing. reason that? never heard that, ladies gentlemen...is live Tennessee... resign go work grocery store guess? 

are chances better though? 

Or kids morality aspect it? problem may infect family live house several people multigenerational spread rapidly. Good news! protected least 3 months. 

Bad news, might still sick entire time. Without paying ofc. hath spoken want family get sick though. able forgive something happen ya know? went down? like we're country fat kids. problems virus little obesity. working kids stopping they're full. make kids finish food plates.

Hell even U shaped told kids stop taking pictures school hallways. ~~Schrodinger's~~ Observer Effect Covid, look, there. hope new kind normalcy Oxidative stress contribute hair loss; exactly news. also people's hair loses lot density taking Accutane, example. mean say much pro mask, realistic expect kids wear masks day? could teachers really reach effectively also mask police symptom detectives? Keep telling bud. Thinking people saw large number candidates disliked bernies world view drop endorse biden. think wasnt planned DNC higher ups naive. bernie winning. planned coordinated political hit. Nice well thats heart problem elimination strategy. Even one case covid disaster prevention requires crazy disruption (shutdowns, food chain disruption, security infrastructure etc). sustainable? even possible?

But countries like South Korea example, upending entire food supply chain really worth dealing 50-100 new cases every day anyways? Probably not. mess here, friendo....

especially now. 

in March? somewhat stable..... Correction: 'worst fall...we've ever had' **so far**. need vaccine obligatory inoculation (this unconstitutional based precedent). wrote thread. 10 pm, pretty quiet Chicago. really life saver. Yeah right. can't even get guys water [privacy erected 2017. hax means go ahead football season. seems like absolutely swell idea. Man something wicked early January. tested positive flu covid testing. attended large convention east coast. think might covid plus flu awful got it. also came two waves makes also think exposed 5 days convention. live life one kidney, lung scarring, cardiac issues, brain damage. Yes, unnecessary, sounds like they're fairly safe it. least safe enough think anger unneeded. 

I turn 50 tomorrow planned 15 people similar family cancel since supposed 108 tomorrow. simple understand lockdown economically correct long term success. Sad thing is, people like politicians, simply need instant results.

Take small hit avoid huge hit coming months... really rocket science. failure fun watch. Nope. It‚Äôs you. replied comment spouting incorrect information, I‚Äôll go let read that. I‚Äôve got flu shot, wear mask everywhere I‚Äôm super careful. But, asthma, need little weary getting ill side effects potential vaccine.

As said, think November prime time get No, derpie, thing distrust pathological liars trust them. known false equivalence.

Trump particular well earned disdain nonfollowers him.

Trump earned distrust, long experience, assume lying default. still factcheck claims, without checking, assume dishonest based inductive reasoning.

He often consistently dishonest.

People go orangeman bad, that's shit cultists push. ‚ÄúAnd downvoted spoke truth‚Äù. real tragedy repeating stupid unfounded things read internet simultaneously believing it. Chaos street! want anarchy Communism Holy fuck yes, group humans trying act cohesively going end forming kind ""government"" structure depending scale. Generally speaking anti-government nuts often reveal self-centered narcissistic assholes want rules others themselves. Trump symptom doubt, two party system fundamentally flawed. 

But can't look fanatical behavior supporters tell struck nerve awakened something society. He's radical departure previous president worst ways. You‚Äôre wrong. 

Don‚Äôt trust CDC? doctor expert enough? slew Canadian whole bunch information best mask materials. would bid it??? Idiocy outside US! How? When? Why? entire concept politics attracts sort people *don't* want politicians. agree punishments harsh, that's going stop corruption. SK threw president behind bars likely rest life, yet believe last corrupt politician would pretty naive.

Bad people always going want job. find ways encourage good people want job. pay good money, going attract bad people want leverage position money, altruistic gooders, end day, even good people want better life families, job good among convincing crooks pretty thankless exhausting. goes lot benefits politicians. That‚Äôs viral photo alright obvious solution, don‚Äôt understand schools aren‚Äôt trying get mail shelters P.O. box. even got I.D. PO box address homless lol they're supposed depends state much person behind counter gives shit tell homeless. Luckily mine little old lady. one means yes? u can't compare Sweden countries, Sweden even dense population still got high Go crawl back moron hole. know nothing. I've argued reddit crowd says kids fine back school expect source articles backing argument school necessarily safe. 

Water wet children germ bags. common knowledge. Taking rights away homeless one step time yeah fact parties trapped eternal mud slinging contest succeeds getting nothing done people die preventable disease, economic crisis brought on. also fact people like make worse perpetuating ""our side good guys bad guys"" narrative seems popular Reddit. maybe problem solely resting republicans head, maybe rest parties heads perpetuating dogma two party system. one Governor Dewine used? America done thanks virus collective failure republicans power democrats needed find middle ground gain approval like first time. 

The first stimulus package fucked too. Nice going everyone, voted out. Sit tight. vaccine except Russia. one tell vaccine may emerge, say, Oct 29th?    
Sit tight chill.  Meanwhile, aware happy talk vaccines political considerations involved.    

Meanwhile, lets go tried tested.  ingest less virus, symptoms less severe. wear mask indoors store, etc.to reduce virus ingested outdoors medical condition particularly compromised. (If latter applies, doctor's advice followed).    
Way see it, Covid-19 vaccine business need considered now, next month, October. I'm taking November.     
Meanwhile, get flu shot. I'm going late Sept, early Oct lasts whole season. way, come something, less likely flu. 
Where would rather live?  demand 1 senator work single blue collar job. Needs red since they‚Äôve apparently lost touch ‚Äúrepresent‚Äù. one day, don‚Äôt care it‚Äôs retail, factory assembly, QA, food service. One. Day. want least one know they‚Äôve population get votes.

I live state really low cases probably gonna rise gets cold schools come back, it‚Äôs safest time it‚Äôll be.

On one hand, it‚Äôs young people like chiefly propagating disease going party purely self-interest. hand, social isolation bad... understand there‚Äôs spectrum risky behavior parties extreme end I‚Äôm ultimately missing good time friends gonna get see good time lie bed phone. Piss pool analogy aside, bother everyday feel sad lonely situation isn‚Äôt gonna improve long, long time.  actually still ongoing. Kodak. doubt anything happen investigations. Want help? Vote Democrat November. Bill Barr block prosecution. start student teaching September. üòü Everytime I've checked reads way low. Like 70 degrees.

I keep oral thermometer purse places require temp checks.
Like work. time national teacher's strike. Don‚Äôt wear mask. Amazon shouldn‚Äôt even selling them. longer commute work, I've basically tripled daily step count making sure get enough Vitamin D. 

Walking outside mask low risk activity. clear, show one example policy want implement would take away guns people, right? Dr. Fauci president. don‚Äôt try hard get liberal voters opt voting. Whereas trump voters don‚Äôt fear coronavirus. 

This hurts Biden. wait, theres more! entire Bible nothing made-up story. people gullible? Religion bad joke. No, isn‚Äôt. Read gd book life. mean nobody knows why? It‚Äôs quite obvious since we‚Äôre getting close election. Know aren‚Äôt seeing doctors TV wearing valved masks? aren‚Äôt effective. 

Your entire post load crap. single best masks cotton/silk multi-layered mask. protect well N95. 

Those valve masks masks holes them. Even properly filtered, shouldn‚Äôt wear them. 

Don‚Äôt trust CDC? doctor expert enough? slew Canadian whole bunch information best mask materials completely refutes entire many obituaries look forward reading. every one lying cheating corrupt senile disgusting miserable excuses human being. Fuck people. May find deepest ring hell. Democrats fix things... 2 party system joke... appreciate every family keeps kid home. think people stay home safer school kids go. yessir Eat rich.

Make first. Pretty sure every single person world internet list now. Either US China. We're list using key words sentences regardless said jest quoted book spoken pure academic theory conversation merely expressing distaste actions. going can't happen 1984 rapidly. Show example Joe Kamala saying they're gonna take away everyone's guns. 

I dare you. want Mitch McConnell job? ever deserve punishment? ludicrous, ignorant post. duke another study tests valved n95 mask instead counterfeit one linking earlier?

You link that. I'm DC I'm getting $179/week.

Not exactly low cost living area; there's good chance I'll probably get evicted next month. single one filed bill continue session? Wtf?! people supposed public servants. Fucking Canada giving everyone like 2k month whole time. going about? got lot less money us! spend useless machines death sit there. Trust me, feeling mutual. nearly everyone favor war iraq public opinion strongly favor post-9/11. lying? definitely needs mass organization. way miners strike UK done could template - neighbours could manage fed striking. totally understand always possible US though, especially healthcare linked employment. scale breakdown unimaginable. 

But... would weeks / months pain could bring generations improvements. see get hole asking nicely anymore. That‚Äôs conservative brain you: moderately sociopathic towards suffering policies create, personally experience themselves. It‚Äôs really truthful. It‚Äôs incredibly biased favor side support. already positive day 1
Gotta give couple weeks he'll gonna break loose.

In northeast school starts Wednesday labor day. I'm betting month stock nightmare starts yeah that's quite two party system works. we're gonna poop back forth forever.

don't get wrong trump exceptional needs go, end he's symptom problem root it.  playing devil's advocate I'd point seemed work pretty well south korea. course opening schools would still ideal. value random stranger teach kids seems dubious internet exists. better argument valved N95 masks. really know holds true across valved N95 masks though (is part standard?)

You might want double check study agree anything. study linking masks, authors say data relied on, supposed valved n95 mask tested counterfeit even come close meeting standards.

It incredibly sloppy study meant demonstration apparatus, adn study efficacy masks Maybe children wont likely go trick treat, stupid adults use excuse celebrate. nightclub, bar, private home parties ... etc idk.. find something fk shit Really? expect pass it? ‚ÄúWe decided would risky might lose boys usually do,"" Msutu said, referring fact dozens initiates nationwide die botched circumcisions year.‚Äù 

WTF genital mutilation. Hope ‚Äútradition‚Äù dies this. maybe force prisoners deal covid-19 already are, along overcrowding general resounding silence population?

maybe expand american prison system even more?

maybe send people already lacking empathy place spits back even less empathy before?

america lot problems locking people essentially crushing people's ability live outside prison one don‚Äôt, gloves mask try part. working since May haven‚Äôt gotten Covid I‚Äôve wearing mask gloves whole time. change things look it. bosses pieces shit taking advantage situation need earn living. is. Stunning. couple decades ago wasn‚Äôt unusual frost mid May central IL. people don‚Äôt magically get re-elected. think term limits thing, time people educate instead picking incumbent candidates.  Let eat cake ship sailed. people never ever truly united. even know many people infected begin with, plus whole ""comorbidity issues"". 

The best (aside analyzing everyone's TCell Covid immune reaction) compare total death rates YoY, even would rough estimate. work there. 

And asses article, yes better healthcare, also life expectancy much higher, plus obesity, plus indoor sedentary life style, plus long term care housings ... factors must taken consideration virus mainly attacks demographics. problem may curriculum really lend independent learning home.

Let's put blame really belongs: PARENTS. Kids learn parents involved educated enough help home. parents country barely acquired high school education went college ""experience."" homeschooling distance learning ""work"" students; latter simply basic skills make independent learning worthwhile. Dems house passed bill May. One greatly helps people (stimulus unemployment benefits), businesses (increased availability forgivable loans small businesses), state local governments lay teachers public servants gives money USPS election officials cover mail ballot measures.

Mitch McConnell bring vote give money state local government, unemployment benefits, wants corporations entirely exempt sort consequences force works back even unsafe.

So stop sides bullshit. republican senate Trump. Full stop. Yuuuup. Elections consequences though. doesn‚Äôt way. voted this. üòÇ I‚Äôm toxicologist work solvents daily. incidents due alcoholics drinking hand sanitizer, think headline bit sensationalist.

I believe strict regulations, I‚Äôm supplements general commonly mislabeled Ok buddy. Saying help like saying masks help. Nothing 100% effective except total isolation. Every 5%, 10% reduction spread helps.  (red) state referendum initiative ballots. don‚Äôt feel like it‚Äôs good idea federal government though honestly. Oh yeah, said politicians complicit different comment little down. McConnell may top shit list, Pelosi isn‚Äôt much down. 

Both sides playing political theatre game, president isn‚Äôt actually anything help matters along. weird disaster movies looking like optimistic fantasies passed lot pork. sides guilty. Republicans don‚Äôt care us starving, Democrats using us hostage. bill strictly unemployment benefits, would passed already. Head /r/unemployment discussion this. let take alive get good ratio. Plus gaiters make droplets finer stop going way far breathing mask air goes Wear glasses little lower normal. Rather nose pads sit top mask, put directly [surgical] mask's wire right it. (This works fabric masks too, matter placement.)

The texture mask holds place, slide further. prescription glasses want far down. wire / directly around glasses would slid nose anyway. think republicans made purpose Trump release executive orders matters care think bring him/them votes! lol ""the apolitical scientist,"" standing next pile dead, six figures now, 99% knows would've prevented measures countries took, measures kept calling for, day day out, seven months

really says something values ""apolitical"" lives 200,000 people Facts dont give shit faux outrage. really believe wearing mask stop germs virus? would need cover exposed skin oxygen supply avoid contact contagious viral infection. Don,t rely corrupt media factual information, agenda include truthful me. opposite that.  I‚Äôm going keep posting since three keep posting erroneous crap. 

Jesus. links maybe you‚Äôll stop trying discredit actual scientists doesn‚Äôt uneducated narrative: 

Don‚Äôt trust CDC? doctor expert enough? slew Canadian whole bunch information best mask Wait til oct millions homeless. starving. Like going get bad. people going give guns unless someone forces to. consider politicians pathological liars follow through, case biden co, even going aggressively target minorities white majority. y'all forgetting guy dixiecrat fucking bone marrow, entire career reflected this.

anyway, bill law met soundly lot legal shit anything remotely surrounding second amendment always legal shitshow.

biden trusted either, know take people sub realise voting lousy dixiecrat creep change damn thing It'd amazing kind way talking without physically present. Understatement century, ladies gentlemen Exactly. since he‚Äôs University hours away, age kids often irresponsible, it‚Äôs possible would idea who‚Äôs driving car.  pandemic far over.....the Christmas suicides charts year. Agreed. don‚Äôt know serotype involved 35, nobody hospitalized chances ‚ÄúS-strain‚Äù rather virulent ‚ÄúL-strain‚Äù (I put terms quotes terminology still fairly new epidemiologists use terms clinicians, &amp; vice versa).

Again, view major problem needs better policy solutions don‚Äôt agree anyone right this. Trump clearly utterly fumbled (at best). said, wish robust discussion data sub. many people automatically downvote discussions suggest perhaps need better data guiding decisions. It‚Äôs easier subscribe apocalyptic hysterics guess. 35 weren‚Äôt hospitalized S-strain even fragile COPD patients, immunocompromised, etc came direct contact would still 95-96% chance survival based harshest IFR/CFR estimates. recent CDC data would even suggest IFR 0.6-0.8%

CDC Source Study:
 unployment benefit helps people lot. truthfully, payroll tax holiday would help people more. long Trump finds way via executive action, Pelosi lot options come table. Covid testing issue. PCR unreliable (false negatives infected, false positive post infection), antibodies fade weeks... let's get started crappy tests, lost samples, etc I've never supported Trump never will, he's joke says whatever thinks get votes, unfortunately works. said I'm gonna pretend alternative better. Republicans Democrats two sides coin, neither party ever work towards something outside interests. Fernie. hail King Economy!! Remember, billionaire‚Äôs ability accumulate wealth important thing here. thousand us must die accomplish this, know sacrifice worth it. children understand. need Snake Plissken push button global EMP. Never read something relatable this. I'm point can't care anything anymore. I'm drained. want know never be. *boom stick happy* true. know certainly school spring. Remindme ! 6 months isn‚Äôt mud slinging. Republicans deliberately holding aid Americans.

What don‚Äôt understand that? Dodged bullet head. American gun owners outnumber police 400 1 military 100 1, know shit ever actually hits fan people turn they're fucked. really tho? think we‚Äòve months ago. Germans shown virus material non-contagious... talking Biden Harris coming take away everyone's guns

Actually, look back thread, one referenced ridiculous claim.

The user accused Democratic ticket fighting policies disarmament. responded accusing fearmongering. asked Obama it, pointed Joe Kamala's proudly advertised policies disarmament. asked prove want take away every gun country. would call *strawman argument*.

I think need shut accusation fearmongering point single policy would curtail constitutional rights US residents arm themselves. still want explain Obama Joe Kamala promising us do. Unfortunately them, also people wont wear mask makes sweaty, gets makeup it, looks like underwear face. words, vanity. regardless f anyone still refuses wear mask 6 months pandemic. leave private citizens CHURCHES feed hungry clothe naked. Similar things starting US. Counts manipulated many states, Florida, particular. mask made light gauze, it‚Äôs okay used term, ‚Äúrespirator‚Äù? I'd say talking important issues people think differently important democracy, agree staying inside echo chambers bad thing.

But regardless, different. 80% Americans read headline agree absolutely fucked tolerated. type dysfunction normal, beyond unacceptable pandemic century. 45 days Coronavirus killed Americans 2004 Boxing day Tsunami Killed worldwide. elected officials vacation.... There's nothing talk about. thought great place live saw many idiots COVID. stay inside, A/C, cheaper big cities, still big city amenities, great starting point road trips, job good, etc.

My first summer, though, walk restaurants X days week work building damn heat. always sucked. remind die.. ruins illusion. sometimes happens people forget turn release liability form selling used car (in California 10 days that), new owner doesn‚Äôt turn pink-slip (especially older cheap cars don‚Äôt WANT registered them), case DMV (department motor vehicles) way knowing intended transfer ownership, car still technically belongs original owner. Please enlighten us two parties abandoned posts nothing two party system people somewhat slower. could swear comment responding ""When last time salary increased?""

It's probably eyes though. bad lot people, including president, listen him. think 6 month period us least symptoms, natural reasons anyways. mention Americans neighbors, suspect first people come mind? Canadians Peruvians? honest.

It's US-centric understand referring to. commonly accepted demonym worldwide people USA. pedantic.  That‚Äôs great, they‚Äôve done *urgent* part jobs.  enough people step turtle breaks shell. could hide shell light fire underneath boils alive. useless. wish someone would hurry invent mail phones email teleconferencing senators wouldn‚Äôt need two week ~~sit around nothing~~ talk constituents face face. reliable reports reinfection.  apparent reinfection based 'dead' viral RNA fragments Again, far away election day? earth gonna help? Especially we've yet see impact school 


How going help daily headlines America leads world confirmed cases confirmed deaths? going help keep numbers low possible? I'll let keen intellect wrestle Also: Right California also seeing improvements (or ""improvements"") -- much sway think Trump's secret ninjas California officials?

Are serious dude? Man, try harder make denial seem legit. realize head testing stepped thiis week complete failure testing led massive backlog cases: seem burnout/plateau phenomenon virus (probably tied early superspreaders recovering dying off), understand dovetails falling testing rates % positives.

---- idea SARS viruses general work. 

We get it, love trump, believe facts, understand, mean anyone else delusion. embrace without lying back it. Democrats refuse compromise over? Actually helping citizens? You‚Äôre incredibly vague dodgy concerning actually disagreed on, don‚Äôt explain? Failure implies trying. trying. Shocker Surely can't stupid enough think entire planet faked virus make trump look bad going disappear biden gets elected?

I can't even fathom... sounds reasonable. need reminded SERVE. Exactly. can't get tested go get tested. main problem isn‚Äôt lack availability testing sites appointments. Rather, ***seems largely driven people choosing get tested.*** *male genital mutilation propaganda guise science.

Basically guy said Dr. Fauci crooked Trump's election fix everything something. rate, would perfere college football shut down, rather patchwork games, seems confusing me. teaching, school didn‚Äôt even windows open. classroom always stuffy.

To continue ""going even further"", I'd put #1 issue, inception, US basic lawlessness. mean - mean literally everybody's criminal - referencing way people view wellbeing vs. others. lawlessness.....it's basically lack REQUIREMENTS. People every nook cranny country used able determine level adhere law, little repercussions. ""free"". problem rotten depiction ""freedom"" - yes, sure - people free go get ice cream, go worship, go cash check, go buy merchandise. That's great. - ALSO free pollute, destroy, horde wealth, act total disregard neighbors, loud, obnoxious, uneducated.

Perhaps - use crystal balls - problems country response COVID go way back, right creation. new country created fleeing oppression taxation, starvation dictatorships. country evolved around westwards push gold rush establishment frontier towns law own. Land Free.

So far unknown. often journalists convey scientific language well turned into, said food can't transmit virus. blame one political party (they faults), modern day GOP turned nihilistic death cult.

These people trying reach compromise ran time ‚Äî not-insignifcant faction Republican party debating whether even *should* pass stimulus package omg would founders think (people dead hundreds years)

Bye. anyone listen corrupt fucks anymore? Okay, what? That's exactly works. time... meats vegetables going pot. really care e-coli chicken gets onions, they're going pot boiling water. That's spirit! Start busking! primary vector transmission we'd know already. Yeah area well it, catch indoor restaurant. I'm hesitant even eat outside. trust people stay away me. Plus, places I've seen tables six feet apart. don‚Äôt think true.

First off, ask 50% effective means. either, 

  a) severity disease stays same, possible exposure decreased 50% population.

  b) infection rate stays same, symptom severity decreases 50%.


Both wins, let‚Äôs talk (I would imagine) either gets us back normalcy.

In case a), building level ‚Äúheard immunity‚Äù adding layers layers protections. first layer gotten virus recovered. discussion purposes, let‚Äôs say 5% American population. Now, new research saying significant % us already protection virus due previous exposure coronaviruses, let‚Äôs assume it‚Äôs somewhere around 10% (again, discussion). add another 50%, 65% population immune COVID-19, unable spread virus others. starting build towards level ‚Äúherd immunity‚Äù. 

Now, case b), 50% reduction symptom severity (I assume, based mortality statistics) essentially make bad flu. really tough understand 50% drop symptom severity really looks like (as don‚Äôt good understanding symptom severity distribution), look mortality - 50% death rate reduction essentially bring tenths point point higher seasonal influenza (based current IFR estimates range 0.8%? Someone correct wrong plz).
I think would help make us comfortable possibility getting infected, would allow life return normal. Yes, know death isn‚Äôt negative outcome, reduction severity isn‚Äôt reduction deaths, also would reduce organ scarring/complications, one would assume. extremely worried. Well come guy ate bat got cold anteater it? 

It probably crossed species bat human via intermediary animal, possibly pangolin although looking unlikely. Truth nobody knows yet.

It certainly looks like started China whole world hotspot viruses. virus symptom genetically modified, long incubation period , person symptoms spreading . airborne virus also infect eyes .

*tiny squeaky fart* Nice goin boys article really seems like prime example slapping numbers around say something fits narrative gives headline. first time I've ever seen anyone try claim covid bad spanish flu (which obviously implication headline, even though that's precisely words say), that's absurd claim.

Triply almost every day cloudless, humid, near 100 degrees. supermarket, 'HEMA' Chinese equivalent Wholefoods. quite alarming. individuals need convincing. federal govt options make country safer pandemic politely asking people safe. Trump led nothing jack shit, jack ~~left town~~ fired. bad flu-bug go around kids school last December. under-reported INTENTIONALLY 25% students staff almost month. classes 50% absent. asked front desk it, could say told discuss anybody outside staff. Laughs super pac Liberals vote shaming, name iconic duo long Republicans around, we're going fixing health care system. Medical tourism probably viable way go major issues. true.

[archive link anyone trouble accessing article ](http://archive.is/LpSRQ) think so. also heard sanitation standards less advanced medical equipmebt also factor really hate Republican Party this. They‚Äôre weak spineless ring clock like this. People need help conservative types share frustration. live trump party fucking garbage right now. Actually several cases coldstore found anyone infected via different route. Also genome sequencing ruled border cases left last wave. coldstore still looking like likely candidate, may know next day two testing comes back. mention desperate unemployed people companies would hire employees went strike. explicitly powers though. time felt like it, could send Sergeant Arms arrest republicans failed respond subpoena. don‚Äôt think vaccine that‚Äôs released next months work well all. would argue there's problem people bothered schools seen daycare. 

Teachers childcare providers. two jobs inseparable, teachers would able teach effectively every child's parent present. need accept that, inherently bad thing. need accept childcare innate part job. 

And everyone else society needs start respecting teachers childcare providers important role play society. take care valuable resources - children. 

Humanity evolve parents taking care children entirely own. always group effort, recent history. saying, ""it takes village raise child"" absolutely true, current system, schools villages. It‚Äôs rate virus transmits people, 1.6 it‚Äôs highest metrics you‚Äôre looking relevant didn‚Äôt highest growth rate states. May possible. Election sabotaged speak.

That's lie. Zoom classes definitely different inferior, coming someone majoring field. 

That said, highly advocate opening. going horrible. Got larger study one back up? yelling ""fake news"" things like? idea DNC shadow cabal 5 people unilaterally make decisions entire party hilarious. Especially given illusion shattered considering DNC bent backwards even *more* accessible people like Bernie Sanders 2020 2016, already pretty damn accessible.

If party worked way conspiracy theorists like believe work, Sanders would 3rd party candidate ran 2016 already forgot about. think dems also good, probably take advice. They‚Äôre better republicans, bar fucking low it‚Äôs sort accomplishment something proud Mitch McConnell: Democrats unwilling reach across aisle.

Also Mitch McConnell GOP: unwilling offer Americans fourth Democrats wanting give trying get Democrats pass non-COVID related riders ultimately fuck American people.

I'm huge fan Pelosi, holy shit Mitch McConnell scum fucking earth. wanna point fingers, point him. -b-b-but dont want offend customer &amp; potentially lose money! /s mean they? get go I‚Äôve known would take long time who‚Äôs expecting results lmao   Lead exposure likely always played huge role societal dysfunction. Also, US traditionally flirts eugenics, despite rampant poor health; suspect intentional mishandling pandemic large part due that. 


edit: Maybe *despite* rampant poor health. also live touristy area. number out-of-state license plates level least regular year. local businesses really limiting hours (have ever heard downtown tourist town store closed Saturday? Well are!) ride out. live mask-mandated state still want leave us alone. like check local Covid numbers online, see comparatively low head up/over! Bc could possibly go wrong?? Fear beaver. Australia 90%+ reduction influenza diagnoses winter compared last winter, due public behavior coronavirus. Granted, last year pretty bad influenza Australia, there's definitely effect. Well then, then? I'm really sitting back nothing democracy dies. seems like last chance.

EDIT clarify thoughts: People giving idea general strike even planning stages, especially one propose realistic alternative. sort negativity going deter even people acting. it‚Äôs six months it‚Äôs here; don‚Äôt data yet. Joe Rogan talked many times

It's also boner pill written examine.com Eh think forcing compromise good problem forcing compromise bill pass part parties should. remove party stranglehold.

2) Plurality Americans express opinion pandemic handled

Pick one one, Reddit Explain haven‚Äôt needed coronavirus vaccine. all. SARS MERS faded quickly test it. Modernas mRNA vaccine new technology worked least 7 years point yet. Soon. Social distance work circumstances, Cleaning surfaces temp check nearly nothing asymptomatic transmissible virus transmitted touch.

That entire point post... Everything works, additive fashion. Even masks wouldnt work ignored everything else, people training even put take masks properly without contaminating everything around it. 

""Each thing helps slow down, slows down. several things, add up"" exactly right. better safe sorry. important everybody test without symptoms. It‚Äôs called fall coz leaf fall ground Going Airbnb duplex beach. already contacted separate hvac side. cleaners wearing masks 1-2 hours enter. duplex isn‚Äôt near public access condo.

Anyone remember guy seeding New York early on? Three quarters Americans absolutely correct. that's one ways evolve disease: making people seek treatment.

*Masks work. virus hoax. Masks work. virus hoax. Masks work. virus hoax.*

I'm sorry, saying? must let mind wander. Lucky us let conservatives pass bunch laws intended weaken abolish unions. Oh, wait...

We‚Äôve also never developed successful coronavirus vaccine mRNA vaccine. republics end, looks like might turn. 

Dammit. It‚Äôs actually opposite usually. fuck? post way ""purely political""


What say word Trump automatically purely political? üôÑ really talking fixing fake news. lot people willing believe can't see. Rural America full them. Religion aside, course...

You make one things happen. No, dorms share air bathrooms.

I forced college let stay home semester. one pisses off. said hear mumbling mask. family virus KILL. Including 4 year old sister. nerve people say hoax flu worse makes want rampage.

Seriously. therapeutics come out, finally stop worrying nearly much face mask argument people believe masks. 


Yes, stupid thing say least middle ground. Maybe use therapeutics finally nail transition vaccine, convince people hold little longer US better chance getting position improve things Biden.  Trump get worse.  election partisanship survival.  guys let go read it, unclear, realize 10x stat applies cases March/April? ""doctors"" saying it, CDC/epidemiologists. 

Right estimate 2.5x many currently reported.

So saying needed correcting. make good sense. started listing reported cases percentage totally worthless number. jumped many could infected, threw 10x comment guess confused on. follow im apolitical dont really get emotional politically. think jared kushner ivanka tried get take serious, going to...but reason listened others didnt go hardcore back february... 

so yeah. :/ happened past involving Bill Gates 
,google Bill Gates Foundation polio vaccine, thousands children died it. Totally. assure tomorrow stonk go response appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* infect think he‚Äôs actually trying highlight points. want employees good job make things safe possible, need compensated fairly, won‚Äôt good job (and don‚Äôt blame that)!

I‚Äôve worked minimum wage, drive best job could near zero point. work myself, best work always matters know I‚Äôm getting compensation deserve work. Wow ok now? really really fucking hope don‚Äôt get it‚Äôs ever probably happen. feel long term effects? Also think got it? Please tell us money tree situated

It's thing called taxes, California world-class economy. afford cough one time payment state residents without relying feds. think good. catch people knew symptomatic care. Ah yes, let's open schools thousands kids 1 building put 30 room. I'm sure they're gonna enforce social distancing passing period halls get quite congested. Soooo much better online learning tough one, like rentors multi millionaire conglomerates. feel bad anyone cant pay rent, damn...a years ago wife renovated small condo rent year selling it. really doubt lender would given af tenant pay, pay lol shovel sunshine. Lol, fucking Bible belt heard virus hoax, puts forum need civil disobedience. Evidence?

Take look latest data compiled u/eaglesoar r/coronavirusma.

Overall, positive % non-hotspot areas trended last 14 days. ¬© Positive hotspot areas: thing. Downward trend. 4 5 towns hotspots? Upward trend. states positive % overall down. R(t) &lt; 1.

How better? like Jesus said. how? figured would done already. staying realistic this. What's plan? Yup, also straight lies. He's also parroting ""look Sweden"" Sweden saying ""don't look us."" Who's shithole country now? rude it. I'm sure not. incredible can't see that. certain number teachers sick, unless school one giant auditorium, going kids classes teachers. even that. Texas sales tax also get lot property tax, property values keep going up. California income bracket 9% something like 15k, whereas end paying 12/yr property tax, plus sales tax 2% higher. property tax tends tax wealthy without exemption, 15m house getting taxed 15m house, whereas play tax loopholes take 15k taxes 12k.

Not totally wrong, saying states state tax solely rely sales tax. funny part one person dies there'll somebody say ""sorry, know gonna happen"". Exactly. wait 3 days without anything, get results. live Florida........ There‚Äôs way it‚Äôs gonna hit 4 million!! probably somewhere 500-600k time vaccines safe enough distributed. $$$ decides, always. wonder much true anti-vaccination much hesitance new vaccines? cases problems discovered new vaccines. think vaccine hesitance addressed much easily readily anti-vaccination. 

I slight hesitance new vaccine gone since I've gotten better understanding creating vaccine quickly I'm absolutely getting flu shot year. missed chance get last year got sick. point though vaccine hesitance anti-vac two things probably need addressed separately. Yeah damn frustrating. Like think 60+ days protests/riots bad far...wait till people start losing homes jobless numbers skyrocket school I've ever even aired out. windows opened tiny gap, feeling CO2 levels rising school day.

Like class rooms worst thing aerosol spread pandemic. CFR .9%? would 2.15 million death 'Murica. school-related ones. make asshole.

If want take approved safe vaccine, that's them. That's beauty freedom choice. 

Once available vaccine make difficult return normal life without it. traveling, returning school, working home only. want public anywhere people. I‚Äôm trash? Nice post. Kick kids teeth today?

Full circle stupidity, though. think photo people nursing home? KNOW POS conversation- using internet electricity, right?

Though course it'll vary given well mask usage social distancing followed decrease infectionsness. anyone seriously arguing masks make difference outside social distancing? Fall winter weather say Hi. thought timetable accomplished cutting FDA red tape, completing stage II clinical trials, taking months submit results, waiting months FDA review results. maybe I've missed something this, hard keep track. short answer no. people vehemently decry idea systemic racism closest it. American south would one contested areas elections constant pervasive voter suppression orchestrated American right wing.

Though I‚Äôd take bad flu season day experiencing now. children exempt anyway, especially 4 years old. son autistic well, high functioning severe. He's 24 years old though functional ways 10 year old. completely understands pandemic terrified getting it. cant wear mask either due sensory issues panics feels like cant breathe although mostly hyperventilating. However chooses go stores knows danger virus, told tried scare read educated it. like 10 year old social emotional ways, he's unintelligent. 

That said understand plenty reasons disability prevent someone wearing mask, issue. issue people claiming disability excuse wear mask, trying use ADA weapon scare employees business owners letting get without mask on.

Like you, people disability family member disability concerned enough virus stay home severely limit our, disabled persons exposure, getting others faces screaming HIPAA ADA screaming ""MAH RIGHTS!""  No, even first months 9/11. remember windows broken Sikh owned stores town, people screaming people worked 7/11 across street 8 trying get coffee newspaper shit thrown walked street look like maybe might could middle eastern. remember morning radio shows pundits calling Muslims interned. 

So, yeah. guess that's coming together part specific group. terrifying others. get stuff free

Explain someone dumb look face understand push get everyone wants one N99/P100 respirators...Yes, protect people, significant portion wear drastically reduces rate spread. P100 respirator rode car someone Covid get it. people wearing public basically equivalent fairly effective vaccine.   easily last then.

*pikachu shocked face* Yep, many last straw.

Maybe less likely murdered outright, also kept plenty whites-only places, travel without packing meal case ran Sundown Town, sat back bus literally metaphorically...

But less likely murdered? even pass anti-lynching bill 1952. million vs 200k die timeframe? long enough stretch time, we'll probably hit figures. next months, probably nowhere near 1mn US people right thing &amp; since spring, least NE. original model said 2.2mn US deaths end 2020 full business usual? cry me, Covid-19

The truth is, made us socialist

Not would ever that... Hate articles. 1 side problem politicizing this. Oh yeah ofc. go separate room job drink. results ya getting dehydrated it‚Äôs type job whatever whenever, fully get one thing clear first lockdown people hard time complying rules. kept going parties, beaches, countryside... many comply masks social distancing, despite continuous efforts government police forces precisely daily briefings, news outlets, fines, etc...

And they're going trust holiday goers right thing, without quarantining rules checked enforced? 

Yes, people accord pretty clear many give fuck that, clearly government doesnt either given lack initiative part. virus dissappear stay inside weeks. Yeah I‚Äôm totally shocked. Never saw coming. right wing trying magical 40% more. many people think mask nothing... fucked. depression stems fact friends family crippled killed virus could controlled didnt people like you. Everyone either work overtime stressful environment dont job leading severe financial stress. becoming increasingly apparent government doesnt care safety Americans own. 
This makes depressed. 

We never quarantined state I'm still depressed suicidal. havent day since February work longer hours increased stress pandemic since handle PPE.

There's growing outbreak prison.

The military hospital already taking overflow patients area hospitals. *not* say November time get vaccine. Rather, time consider whether one take vaccine not. meantime, I'm going filter politicization medicine medicine.  I've noticed, coronavirus briefings late, doctors permitted, despite medical issue?    
One thing I'm done government saying. I'm going treat vaccine usable Nov 3rd politically motivated component attached it.    
Lemme see, March, overseas sources heard infectious dose relevant SARS, MERS, influenza, serve default Covid-19 mask wearing would reduce infectious dose people expel droplets coughing, sneezing, even talking. government said no.     
Within weeks time (late Mar, early Apr), decided aerosol component, deaths nursing homes cruise ships explained without aerosol aspect.   
Our government behind 3-6 months. thatsthejoke.jpg surprised one posted link talked today.. still trying figure 200k tests doesn‚Äôt effect percent % one noticed discrepancy negatives + positives didn‚Äôt add up... live similar (but less extreme) climate yes, worth really, really mild Winters have. fair aspects Mexico pretty shit-hole esque. look cartel controlled areas... number politicians killed last election cycle. depends area country. Mass nurses take seriously Apple Google removed app stores? Hospitalization numbers already dropping several hot spot areas. vaccine takes awhile, may even chance virus burns out. advantage eradicated virus; first new case really sends alarm bells ringing. Trump: good opportunity bash China maybe gain votes, want pass that? Oh, never never that. retrospect source progressive memes. memes best source information seamed like would true you‚Äôre actively looking myocarditis COVID-19 patients actively looking flu patients you‚Äôre going find COVID-19 way more. Especially considering sample groups you‚Äôre taking aren‚Äôt random way people get flu year know about. It‚Äôs entirely possible flu causes exact type asymptomatic myocarditis COVID-19 don‚Äôt know.

Has anyone done studies effects flu similar viral infections asymptomatic patients? matter even good estimate asymptomatic flu patients? know met aut-wad!  financial crisis took almost decade get back pre-recession levels lot ways. look unemployment allow many businesses fail, theory, businesses would start going start businesses? reality TIME things recover individual people matters whether find job locally. 

And ‚Äúborrow money infinity‚Äù - yes - borrowed trillions dollars country pay interest on. fucking saving grace worlds reserve currency able keep rates near 0% interest expense overwhelming. 

If cost US borrow ever went would really difficult decisions programs cut country. could get rid military suppose presents problems. can‚Äôt get rid social programs education. 

So again, circle back, completely fuck economy structural level lockdowns, multi-year decade long problem. 

I say people get ‚Äúfatigued‚Äù 5 months virus. know anyone thinks outside ~~journalists~~ influencers. Kinda like whistling past 80k flu deaths year since...checks notes....forever Yeah. Thankfully protestor crowd tiny one takes seriosuly well welcome Mexico... depends come in. excuse politicize virus, 9/11 politicized FUCK Banning liquor sales would unbelievably poor decision. prime example people buy everything media says, scientists say.

Most infrastructure provides clean water US created 1950s 1960s post war boom. Plenty money taxes cover costs, plan future well.

Back then, people thought economic boom would continue, design water plants last decades little upkeep, designed operate cheaply provide lot output.

Between now, economic boom gone away, wealth unevenly distributed.  Cities get less taxes one wealthy person 10,000 lower class people one wealthy person, 4000 middle class people 6000 lower class people.

Without money pay upkeep, water plants would shut down, cities charge fee separate taxes avoid going broke providing expensive water.  start charging fee, easier justify increasing fee cover costs. Incidentally, also easy require fee paid late never declaring house without water service ""unlivable"" forcing people move out.

Which ended today, poorer communities able pay enough keep water drinkable (Flint, MI).  Federal government using money things infrastructure years (wars, military industrial profits) there's lot crumbling cities US. Unfortunately US lacks properly functioning government.

Hard disagree. US government, lack response crisis, functioning perfectly. impoverishment bug system; feature.

It may seem like I'm playing semantics post, I'd argue important distinction. government failing, response citizens would boost assist it. succeeding, know duty fight it. Consuming pangolin meat safe then. Seems ignorant people complaining about. 0.01%?

It's 6% mortality completed cases 3.14% total cases. could maybe argue that's lagging testing capabilities leading millions missed cases, would lower rate. estimates factored around 1.2%.

There single accredited institution claiming 0.01% fatality. either wrong making shit up. leaderless country expect Neigh-slayer get chance major problem also extremely low

Does infecting parents (and others) count major problem? everybody's logic kids end fact kids risk? It‚Äôs 3/4 aren‚Äôt following every time go out. applies people. That's thought too.

Describes pandemic itself. People acted though thing lockdown affected personally.

Can somebody clear something though? articles Reddit make seem though pandemic America accelerating, yet [the suggests spiked 10 June 18 July, slowly declining since. Continuing trajectory before, 150,000 new cases day, around 50,000.

Is data coverup, would cause dramatic spike infections gradually stop? Also can't imagine kid could focus math 90. interested subject really liked Dr Osterholm‚Äôs podcast can't read headline without context Fauci saying. He's referring return full, 100% normalcy, packed bars stadiums COVID fully rear view. obviously significant changes restrictions lifted then. anymore political original post? 

I agreeing post sharing quote someone else said shared them. would've extremely different first response ""it's hoax"".

I'm sure really think wrote way true.

This partisan stance, objective critique complete lack leadership continues make matters worse, today. aren't. Lockdowns implemented officials clue time. know thing wear masks Actually bad thought  rise fall, eh... I'm asking feels need PRESENT first option option. thing, watch: 


That taken two ways

1. aliens control planet lying you
2. cdc warning Outdoor school would great winter Take moment appreciate delta number hospital beds per 100,000 vs delta number ICU beds.

Per 100,000 people, Us 76% number ICU beds Germany has, 35% total hospital beds. perfectly shows American healthcare system leads people avoid care unless they're actively dying. capitalism fellow man competition...  wonder came name. Quit bragging idiot, guys pathetic everyone knows it. many dichotomies US never fail surprise covid initially start winter? Read article preliminary results available end Sept, takes weeks raw data come teams bio-stats researchers pour figures &amp; make numerical conclusions efficacy. there's data adverse side-effects who's risk complications vaccine crunch through. simply matter pass/fail. doubts strongly enforced. even 10% attendees refuse wear masks authorities would overwhelmed. guess option would go venues &amp; shit adhering read ""at least 3 months""

They comfortable saying immunity lasts long. they've found something indicates immunity disappears point. Yeah wearing masks n shit.  Oh I'm stating saw. pretty different dynamic state has..I'd say ride middle overly protective care free. working family I.

My main comment curiosity would spread much. I'm concerned myself. I'd like see numbers. didn‚Äôt know that. Never thought before. would assume combo each.

The vaccine decrease chance infection chance severe disease 50-70%. believe that's they're shooting first round vaccines.

Eventually develop effective ones. Probably hit 98% needed ensure eradication, decrease severity bad cold/standard flu range time acquired immunity vaccination, completely move on. Infection rate would decrease greatly course. 

Interesting tidbit, believe OC43, one coronavirus family members first passed cows humans believe outbreak severe disease similar we're seeing now, much smaller scale (probably less contagious back things limiting travel conditions). time we've built immunity humans coronavirus, causes one stronger ""common colds"". lends credibility idea partially effective vaccine acquired immunity exposed quickly take us pandemic perhaps even make SARS-CoV-2 completely manageable. relative significant external factors. looking deaths (and probable excess deaths bumping US totals Sweden smaller extent), Sweden US comparable, within 20% other. even sure top, tbh. ready praise US strategy? not, maybe Sweden's strategy praiseworthy. 

truth told, need stop black-and-whiting controversy. Clearly Swedish (and US) strategies ideal praised. Sweden condemned? necessarily. Soccer/football analogy: Every country world 3-1 COVID. 10 minutes go, coach fired new coach brought in. Imagine froze game gave new coach 3 days train execute, restarted game. judge new coach's performance. countries amazingly enough quickly scored 3 goals won. (NZ, Taiwan) countries scored 2 goals OT (China, South Korea). Almost island advantage. Maybe 50 countries scored twice pushed draw. Maybe 50 countries lost game 3-2, missing tying goal. Maybe 50 countries (Africa) removed nets COVID keeps scoring announcers (testing) seeing goals. Brazil refusing recognize still game progress reason. Somehow US managed lose 6-1, whatever, we're used perennially losing soccer. point is, COVID-19 hard fucking curveball handle. difficult intersection science, policy, urgency. IMO, Sweden controlled ball well took good whack it. hit goalpost. made defensive mistake (elderly homes) gave goal, correcting making another good offensive charge, maybe scoring end make 4-2. 3-1 hard. Sweden tried something unique that... ""didn't work"" maybe? (it disaster, clearly ended far ideal.) Yet I'm willing rip coach new asshole losing game last 10 minutes. 

I'm honestly surprised we're still talking it. understand can't (virtually) islands like South Korea (cut N. Korea). instead though examine strategies 50 countries pulled COVID draw? Sweden worked 2 jobs part-time somehow passed class bottom quartile, congrats them. Smart islands valedictorians, hooray, privilege wins again. lets something interesting talk salutatorians forced draw write it. continuous examination Sweden eeked C unfruitful and, point, overplayed. wife works er level 1 trauma center se FL tell traffic way last 10 days so. Way down.

They packed holds er room. difference incredible.

Not sure going on, words moron, is. Georgia State leadership give shit health well citizens (unless consist duality rich white). Well mean, employers much incentive accurately check. Less workers means less productivity. follow ""recommendations guidelines"" appear they're best stop spread calibrate equipment hardly anybody fails. smoke mirrors. Ive heard whopping 2 people failing company around thousand employees. first week temp checks starting it. Temperature checks also take account people whose natural body temperatures run low. Mine usually 96.5 - 97.5 range. temp 99F, would explained away normal variation people, fever need concerned. pesky kids. It‚Äôs ran feds, police AST, there‚Äôs police dept. know there, know understand you‚Äôre stuck shit goes sideways. 
I know women pregnant go hotel anchorage around 34-36 weeks they‚Äôre close hospital, die night, funeral home come collect body AM. virus proven difficulty breaching 60% even densest worst areas (queens)

Because social distancing. shock anyone. Last read, expected peak social distancing somewhere 20-40% people get it. Without, somewhere past 70% people get it. 

If people went back lives lived last year. mask, social distancing, rules capacity, group entertainment running full steam ahead, society would devastated without vaccine. dry heat tho...

I've trying stay away anywhere indoors time shared air recirculated.

Maybe slightly overkill, I'd rather safe sorry disease. since yet understand long term effects virus find best option roll dice help it. Long term effects could things like organ damage, circulatory issues, effects future pregnancies woman, etc.

There's enough unknown factors right I'm taking every single precaution can, even people agree fine risk low. Low risk still risk lol, I'm gonna tempt fate. truly dumb concept could instituted even dumber President. recommend people listen [The Osterholm episode 19 talks new science specifically surface transmission, might like hear.  find listening podcast help reduce anxiety. course not. so? effect them... Tell they'll feel soooo much better chipped - shoot you.  nice wish, highly improbable. actual death rate shown point less .5%

Isn't hospitals good shape, though? hospitals overwhelmed death rate seems skyrocket. early 2019 COVID RNA found waste water samples. sewage. 

They found positive cases later 2019 Europe. Epidemiologists estimate December 31st, 2019 tens thousands cases Europe Asia already. 

And yes heard flu like illness spike US Europe without positive flu test results. wondered thing myself. possible less contagious version going around, L, S, eventually G strains made able infect millions ease. hard say. sure, maybe first case hit Seattle (they estimate happened around New Years Xmas). maybe form before.

Edit: posted early Um...if talking Kemp, us actually voted Abrams. Kemp oversaw election, definitely conflict interest there. could least BS conspiracy game. polio thing simpletons goto. He's microchiping vaccines cure virus created. Get program. realizing meaning usage words change time. america great yet!?!?!? Cuz looking like shithole rampant corruption ignoring ppl. They‚Äôre downvoting it‚Äôs callous attitude. thing virus though feeling looking healthy mean asymptomatic contagious carrier. solid questions ask mask wearing right thing do. 
Given reliable safe vaccination pending makes lot sense. 
While prognosis good know happen yet. 
 
So wearing mask vs. virus means putting artificial evolution selection pressure we're getting R 1 that's concerning. However let rip virus gets way chances mutate. There's free lunch.

Apparently it‚Äôs people wanted hear. care? hope Mitch come back. care why. separate note, 1918 influenza happened today, mortality rate would substantially lower well, 1918. even know influenza viruses existed ten years later.

If COVID-19 existed 1918 instead 2020, it'd probably magnitudes lethal. Yeah grandfathers involved WW2. making political joke.  wearing proper mask properly, yes leaks.

These places closed since people ungrateful. Haha!! know right!? School starts Monday, It‚Äôs like watching train wreck slow motion. Great, thanks. That's little confusing though. original statement think valved masks problem believe virus needs stopped source. sources effective different types masks preventing spread droplets.

I'm really sure graph imgur actually says. Sorry, include actual data, experimental methods, even cite source comes from. might perfectly fine study -- can't really judge without context.

The link looks good though. also makes pretty clear statement valved masks performance valved N95 mask likely affected exhalation valve, opens strong outwards airflow. valve compromise protection wearer, decrease protection persons surrounding wearer. comparison, performance fitted, non-valved N95 mask far superior.

Sounds like CDC recommendations spot on. valved masks primarily protecting wearer outside contaminants. are, however, nearly good protecting others infection wearer.

I think I'm still going take CDC's judgement stopping virus transmission source well. wish everyone else would could get past back (mostly) normal life. Okay I'm younger person lives alone working remotely since March. gone month two times without seeing anyone know due COVID blowing Florida. started get recently I'm going little crazy. hot Florida right much outdoors trust public indoor places currently. absolutely hate regular sick flu even cold avoid can. 

I thought killing thoughts falling back old habits fucked haze talk it. worse nothing.

It situation masks. Literally downside. people shitting pants outrage masks.

I'd say gives comfort keep up. vaccine doses paid clinics administer paid costs mostly covered private public ""Most"" commercial insurers agreed waive out-of-pocket costs customers,

So lock things DONT ERADICATE VIRUS less delaying inevitable fucking livelihood country. You‚Äôre making two mistakes time.

If look places like New Zealand, need cases - like less 100 per state - need quickly identify source cluster - quarantine groups. 

If cases it‚Äôs going matter. Seriously. sucks answer fact it‚Äôs spreading. 

Countries coming lockdowns watching resurge again, even travel restrictions place. Lol Well I‚Äôm excited see results! It‚Äôs going hard fought discovery you‚Äôre working lot missing data world‚Äôs collective complacency viral research. hope findings help us better understand virus. yet school continuously claims everything fine everyone enters pass temperature check. Eh, California really high standards teaching degrees. degrees transfer states well, going different state California rough probably require additional classes. antimatter? Instead allowing taxes increase property values, CA caps taxes based sale price tiny annual increase.

In order fund city budgets, instead hitting existing residents property tax --

Genome testing? new strain? bad realizing words definitions meanings. let random individuals decide English language means on. Thank informing stick, imparted lot useful things think about. trumpian language fact. I'm worried. idiotic headline. average mental age buzzfeed reader 11?

Sorry tone work text well. agree you, actively group working (comparing findings covid respiratory viruses) Probably higher I'd bet, ask lmao socialized healthcare system trouble too.. definitely understand this, baffles word better. Maybe say, ""conclusive studies yet done""?

That would far less misleading. US lost virus containment opportunity. ignored go burnout localized herd immunity. political leadership directly responsible. office, price calculated levied relevant parties Administration. Also biker thing happened recently.. though I'm sure many 250k would get tested anyway. That's biggest problem facing politics today. many people ideology. They've confused antagonism ideology ideology really thoughtless contrarian. live schizophrenic-like life reality must always bent invalidate whatever another group thinks. hate Virus: population economy? 
Government: ...
Virus: Ok I'll take I'd say nurses heads shoulders many professions. I'm biased nurse Northeast, well educated area country, nurses believe masks vaccines. things go south Midwest ratios start change. wouldn‚Äôt take vaccine released year. Sounds little like herd immunity! That's factor, far biggest issue parents. Lots parents care child's education, time ability assist it. countries Lol can‚Äôt believe anyone still whining common core completely fuck economy structural level lockdowns, multi-year decade long problem.

And nothing millions Americans die economy fucked *anyway*. solution obvious.  think people say pleased things going right either paying attention literally anything they're Anarchists. tax fuck baffles people think going partying good idea pandemic country earth medical facilities cater mass infections matter well funded might - idea lack funding driving lockdowns complete utter nonsense.
 
The lockdown measures harsh shown work harsh shown work not. pretty simple stuff. got sick flu December, plan get flu shot year. think might COVID. Got antibody test ordered taken yet put everything sink, spray chemical let dry on. rinse everything 15 20 minutes later. also take anything boxes bags dump everything clean plastic bags. 

It takes minimum effort time mind taking extra precautions. 

I also doubt really need keep wet full 10 minutes. That's probably worst case scenario something absolutely covered virus. people voting people school boards mixture parties, get parts population.

But teachers general educated democrats. bad ones dumb ones, majority left leaning tricked terrible information. dare insult Fanta. ya kind see issue here? Almost one studied otherwise asymptomatic myocarditis viral infections COVID-19. say indicative virus‚Äô severity kind painting whole picture. Especially signs point prevalent flu viruses currently think. prediction based Science projecting climate change going kill us all. It‚Äôs like didn‚Äôt read whole comment stated felt would discussed felt thing imminent, ok. market. FED‚Äôs dumping much QE it. Yeah, also I‚Äôve heard they‚Äôve started producing already well. sure it‚Äôs true though. I'm pointing works. interested. Frankly lack intellectual curiosity tiring me. I‚Äôve heard everything need virus , hasn‚Äôt one day since February . can‚Äôt wait November virus Yeah, 5 3 year old daughters. socially distanced parents first 4 months probably. that, understanding long going go, made decision drop distancing other. Basically, getting older, want miss potentially years granddaughters' lives. 

That said, family (wife I) work home. click collect, order online, careful possible. parents retired, also super careful. So, figured residual risk mitigation worth benefits. Understand big breakout. Uh oh Lets honest here. US already downward spiral. corona virus gave little shove. im yet. Im gonna wait til later month probably survive, think world I'd want send kids into

There's doubt humans survive. Humans live environments ranging arctic desert. pessimistic possible, question society look like. fear; we're going nowhere. Remember back Jan blocking travel US preventive measure somehow spun seen racist? Yea. tourists ever seen little town Add pneumonia moving in. basic Congress delay collaboration next stimulus Sept 15th? Again, pay it? smarter them? Still received real answer anyone here. I'll wait. Healthcare probably...  ironic.. covid 19 supposed global effort defeat virus. information should‚Äôve available scientists across globe. Russia shouldn‚Äôt ‚Äúhack‚Äù anything. 

What see? Well we‚Äôve seen likes US UK supposed involved global effort, attempt privatise vaccine information.. public health truly forefront, wouldn‚Äôt allow Russia‚Äôs, smart, capable scientists access information countries could work together vaccine? guess money everything makes world turn. international travel involves putting absolute trust another country properly prevent anyone could sick leaving country. happening, viruses ridiculous asymptomatic presymptomatic characteristics, can't guarantee keep cases down.

When say unless essential, essential travel quarantine 2 weeks necessary usually family matters take prolonged time.

International tourism however, week 2 trip tops, people want explore cities, see cool resturants, visit landmarks. They're normal times great, sure hell quarantining 2 weeks country, say ""well need quarantine 2 weeks prior"", hit airport, basically ruins quarantining home, quarantine there.

Our traditional 1-2 week international tourism vacations okay current times look way corporations get trillions bailout money pretty much agree everything said here. also think normal new pathogen. around long enough know enough transmission, contagiousness, severity, etc.. Even testing seems quite off. there's much anecdotal evidence can't relied denied. example, wife's coworker: boyfriend symptoms, tested positive, yet girlfriend (they live together). kissing everything day developed symptoms never isolated other, never ended ever getting symptoms testing positive (she multiple). yet there's situations single family member spreads entire family single Father's Day dinner (this TX father ended dying, too). So, know enough yet common denominator is. know saying, can't true, sense, are...at least currently.

Regarding 5 million cases hospitals: things heavily consider:

1. Testing inaccurate, margin error goes ways. test rate could even higher due false negatives, lower due false positives. false negatives *more* common.
2. Many people hard time getting tested, many foregoing testing due variety reasons (no extreme enough symptoms, fear going hospitals/clinics/testing sites)
3. death rate could fa higher due people dying home fear going hospital first place: Death rate biggest fear, far biggest problem. concern virus potential cause mid long term issues, many permanent uncommon happens lot diseases, especially Flu (although hate comparing two). COVID demonstrated deadly severe flu endemic respiratory disease society, percentage people experiencing long term symptoms (both young old), likely way, way higher anything we've seen before.

And we're even sure respiratory disease first place, vascular disease spread via respiratory channels!

So again, think due novel-ness virus much conflicting information. Right now, there's lot theories enough data really say one truer another. we'll know like, 6 months, I'm basically wearing masks, distancing isolating while: giving science chance catch up. example, used wipe groceries every time went shopping, enough data fomite transfers know that's primary vector, I'm relaxed process now. Remember citizens, work together get this. *Corporations laughing background politicians fly bunkers stocked food &amp; supplies next 6 years. Damn. Australia playing. response coronavirus shows unnecessary dangerous higher education administration is.

And

""It currently unclear herd immunity could happen COVID-19""

Also, source 1 month old, still older mine 1 2 doctors Russia end Gulag Yeah, Black Death killed something like 60% Europe's population. Europe obviously recovered. important look distribution death rate public policy take account. death rate 45 &lt;1/10000; driving car bigger risk age bracket. 75+ pretty lethal, quite bit .65% IFR. middle, generally similar pneumonia death rates exceeds approach 75. Incredible! Like half year later realize this! Imagine voluntary rationing turning household items cause. 

Every crisis exposes character. say, LACK character Hospitals Wuhan tried staying open despite infected staff. know asymptomatic presymptomatic transmission yet leading 40% early cases infection source traced hospital. 

In America right now, 900 HCW died thousands infected. yet asymptomatic/presymptomatic still asked work. say yes need money.

What mean? means keep schools open private ones profitable, can't quarantine everyone. Therefore we're slow motion train wreck. spirit schools opening, take warning *lesson*. know virus receptors work? can't attach anywhere want. know, lets open Schools then, really help things. mainstream media across globe certainly pushing this. it‚Äôs good guess second wave sort, severity knows. likely guided government keep people heightened aware compliant another lockdown required. flue seasons stay inside avoid exposure...this year, definitely get shot. dont know. would still play safe. Idiocracy Explain guy ate bat pangolin whatever fuck getting virus started whole shit. don‚Äôt super buy this.

It‚Äôs also going depend deals regulatory agencies. US already manufacturing millions doses definitly going speed mass production. I‚Äôm sure India throwing financial weight around much always tell never gone become endemic like influenza now. It'll another flu shot every year. honestly that's best hope see. start tell vaccine conspiracy bill gates filling ""x""(whatever newest insane theory is) usually tracking device.  see Disneyland closing forever Halloween Halloween rate balance international travel okay not. SportsBars can't packed many Swedish political papers. LO still behind it, probably better many others similar papers.

‚ÄúWe since learned people contagious asymptomatic.‚Äù 3 months isn‚Äôt long... Well, it'n enough doctor, valid opinion. example, physician ophthalmologist would opinion valid firefighter.

Well, great. clean air, too? Right, conditions resulted mutation here. viruses mutate become less virulent. Spanish Flu specifically mutated become virulent, worst, severe cases western front sent back overcrowded cities overcrowded trains overcrowded living quarters. mild cases stayed warfront, mostly outdoors. meant that, unlike viruses, severe cases spread virus worse, therefore natural selection favored severe mutations. 

With Covid-19, viruses, opposite. Severe cases tend stay home sick infect people, mild asymptomatic cases majority infecting go meet people/work/socialize etc. want leave people path hurricane? don‚Äôt support trump? everyone subreddit make politics. quite literally data. fucking bizzare Thats funny cause dont watch news biased fearmongering news source lungs still damaged even asymptomatic.  Force majeure get fine. Total fucking bullshit though. really enraging. Bloodbath relative existing tragedy mean. OPs main point becomes ""worst fall ever"", hundreds thousands would perish (in 3 months) logically worse current ""worst fall record"".

I hold CDC high regard (and I'm sure OP also) he/she essentially saying ""either reputable organization wrong (unlikely) going get lot worse people currently expecting (alarming something absolutely pay attention to)"".

Exercising critical judgement never idiotic. last four years season 8. So, question becomes, ""were people flu reporting due fear COVID-19 reporting folded COVID numbers?"" 

I would assume former since remember neck US everyone holed completely unwilling go hospital walk-in clinic unless meant life, limb, vision. disagree. close entertainment social issues also cause deaths deaths likely younger working class.

There‚Äôs one^ According doctors, COVID.

/s honestly seems like mask wearing social distancing pretty good job knocking infection rates sufficiently high compliance. least, that's pattern far urban areas around globe. places US biggest problems places people stubborn it. Maybe bad idea good portion political apparatus set ideology ""government never anything circumstances"". schools faring there? occasional outbreaks shut schools down? students wear masks class, no?

Jesus. expose lungs direct sunlight, die COVID-19.  don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs much mind games. see point Fuck us fam course understand people think need pay registration fee listen wacko spiritually connected higher power. think 4% death rate 2% people actually symptoms, hun. Imagine people living WWII told lights night entire town might get bombed. need limited gallons gas per week ships actually make Europe. imagine also tested positive salmonella, maybe E.

OP also opened floor asking anyone could think another reason. 


What? see that? see: Uhhh Spanish Flu second wave fall 1918. 195,000 Americans died October alone. 


Followed by: taken two ways

1. cdc exaggerating/ignorant
2. cdc warning 


No one asking question here. second post volunteers possibility ""cdc exaggerating/ignorant"" nowhere, seems coincide Republican political narrative deflect responsibility USA's poor pandemic response Trump administration CDC. 


Sorry I'm missing something... Melbournian, gloomy winter here, we're undergoing second wave strictest lockdown measures world, can't leave home past 8 pm without risking $1600 fine

It's got bit morbid vibe Strange timeline virologists new ""twitter personalities"" exact person I'm describing. Although hundres thousands shit compared many millions folks thinking virus hoax, over, nothing worried still blame protestors. Fucking mega lol.

Edit: add mega lol mind boggling hypocrisy here. Plus never said protestors spread, obviously drop bucket covid deniers Education seen education daycare parents work. People choosing F2F return work responsible becoming true education partners educators children. federal government, well many state governments, chosen let regular working people fend pandemic. government-sanctioned economic pressure maintain pre-pandemic status quo. 

While F2F may ideal typical school year, way F2F best modality learning students following strict physical distancing hygiene protocols. put another way.

I'm teacher private school Monday back class children. real social distancing children myself. I'm scared know get sick. know go back.

I live near one largest airports Europe. planes flying. government gave billions (over 7) one company heavy layoffs still coming. friends work know job gone. parents children teach work airport losing jobs. school budget issues. likelihood job going high. 

What us people income? educated, generally young since young families, often settled location debt. virus still going around jobs return to. 

We shut get health system strong enough cope virus. that. subset people well connected, might able pull through. going happen subset lower educated need middle class income? Social systems strong enough handle people.

If close everything long period time, would help people affecting shut policy? can't short sighted must balance deliver health care short long term. That's kinda thinking read it. Far know even accept cash. 

But sign like expectation critical thinking skills high. iowa something similar. 20% county level 10% school must absent. school must request online learning. weren‚Äôt wrong called policies arbitrary back spring. again. kind proves hard lockdowns pointless. 5 months? Insane. Throw selling drugs pay intubation got Breaking Worse. positive test percent used metric determine school opening? 

Seems like easy influence number controlling test availability number tests performed. Like, ""Oh shoot, we're 24%. Let's hurry send healthy people get tested."" Whoops. Well, know almost failed math, lol. Based on.....? meant lack current mask wearing social distancing karen crowd leading prolonging this. Correct.

‚ÄúSchools reopening‚Äù nothing instruction. It‚Äôs requirement start packing people back unsafe schools workplaces. also guarantee dumbest fucks you‚Äôve ever met demand everything else reopen too, like ball games, group activities etc competent adult wants right now. Wandering hospital, riding elevator...  literally don‚Äôt know. 

Last year, 47% got flu vaccine. That‚Äôs even majority country. 

They continually ELI5 since continue act like stupid children saying no, logical response issue kids vectors. 

Why keep seeing this? larger psychological phenomenon associated thinking kids getting virus problem? socio-egocentric model virus safety? I'd interested study this. knew anything (ie: nurse above)

Honestly feel like anyone ounce common sense known dealing brand new virus therefore know jack would act across different seasons. medical expert idea anyone believed true. It‚Äôs also worth mentioning Shelby County School district different entity Shelby County Health Department issued guidance, assume suburbs Collierville, Bartlett, Millington Germantown would fall well.

I‚Äôm sure, think districts least in-person instruction going on. Millington announced positive case week, opened doors Monday. get vaccinated work company time that's definitely prefer. Much lower risk catching random disease sometime went doctor for, too, since people usually go GP that. Yes, good news.

These numbers come Texas Department Health Human Services, CDC. trend lines well local numbers coming county-level health departments across state. Therefore, seems numbers trustworthy.

Drops testing numbers lack demand testing, appears lack new people infected.

Texas appears hit peak hospitalization wave approximately July 22, 20 days statewide mask mandate, steadily dropping ever since. Ah, see. That‚Äòs don‚Äòt let bring existence.

Wait, don‚Äòt restrict that.. thats worse 195k deaths month? current population would 600k month. yah exactly, surprise. mean hope colleges schools aware Covid campuses schools. way avoid it. link broken Vaccines.gov wonder percentage potential flu patients needing bed already dead covid. Also discussing letting child engage low risk activity outdoors. remember I'm saying ignore Coronavirus wear mask, we're talking whether child able play outside.

And like not, socially isolating child 18 months formative years consequences. Everyone decide comfortable with. real life, situations involve concept called ""Nuance"". One key aspect single aspect issue valid. look it. Thank you, refrain based advice. people think going better students constantly switching online in-person back instead developing system consistently implemented? I'm saying online best option, I'm saying going easy students know one day next expect. really hard set routines world completely unpredictable. Also struggle glasses fogging up, contacts seem like best option case needing touch eye adjustments.

I piece copper wire bridge part help seal better. nurses use medical tape glasses. Definitely annoying, sometimes unbearably so. Finally. time up, US. Time fall. LOL ‚úåÔ∏è pay $50 past year cuz insurance It‚Äôs also worth mentioning Shelby County School district different Shelby County Health Department issued guidance, assume Collierville, Bartlett, Millington Germantown would fall well.

I‚Äôm sure, think districts least in-person instruction going on. Millington announced positive case week, opened doors Monday. links info low herd immunity models?

...it really seem like burns areas really quickly slows sometimes seems like big enough change behavior warrant cases plateauing dropping quickly. education system ass anyways getting anything Covid. Given horrifying lingering effects I'm wondering simple things like common cold bigger issue people Covid. poor corporations, need keep us Stone Age outdated technology innovate products keep us dumb happy ration food. People tend forget winter/summer here, there's parts globe opposite season. English linguistics different disciplines. Dumb. dont watch news a


It shows Right literally say ""the worst fall ever had"" think safe compare. Nothing take steps against. deaths? Last year higher deaths per day year. pandemic. Canadian, usually end kinda laughing stupid shit goes US. getting ridiculous. company sells shit tourism industry US. losing work probably close shop dont figure shit soon. Executive privilege abused force use domestic tests labs

Source? ammunition anti-science, anti-maskers. expect, demand dogma never changes. reason follow TSA processes :(

Stopped local bar/restaurant yesterday pick food.  busy scrubbing bar seating 50+ unmasked people dining area. ""Until"" horrible tell. know gonna reach 25% still wanna open? Well hospitals normally close population centers *median* distance likely lower. country‚Äôs population evenly spread surface, even Australia‚Äôs. issues old dirt lets throw huge numbers try scare people case counts. Great way find witch burn. hate here. ya doom Looks like Putin won. Brown people rounded put quarantine camps; white people allowed quarantine home. Absolutely racist. Playing politics rather what's public best interest. Thank you. know movie I'm watching tonight. That's similar example mutually exclusive.

It possible both:

1. aliens control planet lying you
2. cdc warning you

Given 195,000 premise, possible both:

1. cdc exaggerating/ignorant \[the CDC wrong\]
2. cdc warning \[the CDC correct new record surpass old record 195,000+ deaths Fall\]

It one - there's logical option. Potentially. Except covid W curve like Spanish flu was. fucked healthy 20-30 year olds fast. So. Americans actually taking herd immunity approach. excuse opening schools. politicians crafty indeed. /s There's point debating September October November. Nobody knows likely works, millions vaccinated start 2021. 

Oxford probably good estimates pretty tight lipped apart enough data vaccine group. Guess Colleges good something. kids learning theyre full fucking scammy shit Oddly enough, ND first university pull students study abroad happened. I'm confused change plans time around. sense rates?

You saying it‚Äôs prefect let rip? amenable anti-maskers. either adamant wearing one, regardless location, believe symbolize tyranny act muzzles. I've never noticed individual believes sort ""middle ground""

I have. They're people anti-maskers hard identity, anti-mask basis ""discomfort"" ""some doubt."" sometimes wear masks, sometimes don't. believe pandemic, believe bad locally. They're people might wear masks time, forget one, drive back home grab it.

These people convinceable. want Christmas quick painless death. guys realize winter right parts world. know. Dr. Fauci, comments **April** program announced? realize may problem people started ask every vaccine one takes like 5 years develop? r/covid-19 official information sub, theres serious garbage sub mods suck omae wa mou shindeiru ob-gyn would know

FYI: sounds like brainwashed believe certain vaccines weren‚Äôt necessary. Flu vaccine important. Don‚Äôt feel bad, parents didn‚Äôt good job imparting info either. bubble. grounds treason right   F appreciate saying that, mind I'm coming like jerk. I'm tired reading statistics data disregarded favor opinions feelings. really getting skin lately. I'll probably mute thread point. feel like I've said came say. Sorry pissed anyone off. think still hope something right ""100% normal"" next spring. example, get vaccine available limited quantities get vulnerable populations winter, likely still required social distance wear masks, many services businesses would able open up. 


I think gradual process get vaccine, could another year see true ""normal"". Let's hope things continue develop smoothly vaccine now! Exactly me. bought Peloton that‚Äôs helped totally lose mind. Yes, whole time feel PTSD type thoughts becoming stronger stronger.

I don‚Äôt know anyone else constant gloom back mind world ending nothing stop it. rational mind might say there‚Äôs possible way could true, it‚Äôs taking stronger stronger foothold mind it‚Äôs getting harder shake.

Just peasant thoughts though. feel I‚Äôve eternity, time exerting never ending torment seems never end long we‚Äôve already spent. dark.  Really curious fuck people going strip clubs pandemic.

jfc price one lap dance could get access near-limitless amounts porn -and- blueballed unless that.

inb4 ""there's free porn"" ya know people usin' onlyfans days also add unpopular facts. death rate(people die every day) gone 7600 last year 7100 year. Meaning pandemic. knew that. Quit watching TV people. Especially know weak think yourself. simply giving statistic. bias wants something else, isnt. like, all. Actually saw morning thought wtf restored removed removal. Honest mistake real. dumb me. Realized mistake went post redirected post. Honestly sorry. isn‚Äôt virus ends November. understand. new wave done much all. national level party still pushing old white corporate cronies like Biden. totally support left right now. disappointed gave ""Not Trump"" ballot instead someone actually think wants change country. guess happens society lets know life less important economy necessary sacrifice keep country going. happens complete strangers fine death long get keep freedom.

You start believe it. I've stupidly never taken precautions flu, somehow I've never gotten it. far less contagious shit Ok. straight lying. definitely realistic ""a vaccine could ready go Christmas""

If could actually get hold enough heading right direction start next school year, something.... Refrigerated truck back. dont think understand putting words someones mouth means lol sure. Hopefully things improve soon ): don‚Äôt. ton colleges staying online leave three months. Private schools don‚Äôt follow state guidelines campuses like Notre Dame whatever want. people ones denying reality Thanks friend from... Black Pig/Bull... Buffalo? NY! appreciate well!

Hoax idiots, conspiracy theorists, lowest trumplets.. use outcome justification fits desired narrative. look flat earthers way go debating. resemblences even Trump talks scary, truth denying deflection, irrational attacks alternate reality projection. aircraft carrier doing? Man, it‚Äôs almost like uncontrolled pandemic, unstable economy, social safety net, Kafka-esque unemployment system makes people depressed! would‚Äôve thought! Cool story bro CDC  I've worked school day care, know well. One year maybe 5 years ago nasty ass flu bug made school. Kids lined outside nurses office dropping like flies. think year 25% students staff ended school whatever strain was. Kids nasty boogery germ spewers. businesses good working parents time off. though, something needs change that. kids imagine much better elder care would businesses could flexible family medical needs. idea could make happen though (naturally abuse employee end well). First patient Thailand spotted temperature check. Meanwhile 2 million U.S. year cancer. 30-40% obesity rates U.S. adults. Heart attacks, diabetes, kidney problems, asthma...


Most us want families, friends, co-workers, neighbors, fellow Americans die ""pre-existing"" conditions. someone got upset asked socially distance month wear mask. 


With worker drone attitude I'm sure loads money saved up, fine. like unemployment never existed before. Try thinking ideology mental model, need different ones understand situations 

But yes get frustration, lot bad examples, lot ideologues. people know friends wealthy people China? They're shifting blame, like things say. comment got deleted find incredibly odd seen believe none things listed produced violent people? native Americans underdeveloped? mean people sacrificing natives alter Europeans arrived ones helped hunt black slaves arrived? logic flawed rests assumption underdeveloped societies produce war obsessed ass hats examples listed knowing history wrong. good news?

Winter even worse. people know freelance, middleman lowball take cut. remember flying times Scandinavia Northern Europe 9/11. can‚Äôt recall put belt, keys, wallet things trays inspection, chuck water bottles waste bin, 9/11. Swede, I‚Äôd never write 11th September ‚Äú9/11‚Äù since use ‚ÄúYYYY-MM-DD‚Äùor ‚ÄúDD/MM‚Äù (which would make 9/11 9th November)... plus flu.

And flu typically drops March, pandemic hit. instead finding why, he‚Äôs choosing use conspiracy ammo. He‚Äôs idiot. He‚Äôs smart person can‚Äôt critically think himself. Imo don‚Äôt waste time.

Sounds like medicine - many us cannot respect you‚Äôre greatly greatly greatly appreciate sacrifice, especially time. Lol chill out, talk subtle religious discrimination. woman? like rest country. contact tracing real I'd tested SARS-CoV-2 owner workplace (who significant contact supervisor) mild case COVID. even asymptomatic. Several roommates coworkers flue like symptoms, low, fevers. tested, 6 Covid, 2 family members die.

The symptoms vary widely.

Also handheld meters shit. passed work. started getting chills, got home fever 100. Turned food poisoning, gave us good scare. science-backed evidence antibodies present *in folks post-covid infections, mean tell analyst thinks bunch morbidly obese, diabetes ridden, atherosclerotic hardened, inactive vegetable-state, smoking infested Americans achieve herd immunity? 

Herd immunity achieved nice chunk died out, that‚Äôs called natural selection, properly, THINNIng herd. Let‚Äôs real. Americans can‚Äôt even put coke, McDouble, cigarette, crack pipe, let alone stay inside wear mask. Goodluck achieving herd immunity. Maybe it‚Äôll happen 95% people infected. people sitting home, never leaving house days way coronavirus hit anywhere.

These people fucking weirdos. I‚Äôm telling you. Thank god stopped people getting high drug choice though! Fuck troll. People like can‚Äôt nice things Drug traffickers themselves. Novel?  new interesting.  around 8 months. Yes, thank you. added endorsement Mail Ballots. Done guy. done Fauci mean take pandemic seriously. see real threat lies, people like downplaying bad things are. go silly motorcycle rally, go beach, nightclubs, stay home much reduce workload medical workers part reduce spread.

But no, people want ""smarter"" masses trying prevent getting worse. Winter coming. ""we best numbers country.. best..."" 1-2 whole **orders magnitude** people always right though... Soooo. last point answer. There's southern hemisphere countries reporting mild flu seasons exactly precautions. Northern countries similar level seriousness reasonably expect same.

The US, much. I'm going throw there... pets? Cats ferrets certainly infected seems like dogs least mildly infected well. Would need passports too? Apologies. mistake. Time run away. listen CDC tell worry surface transmission. Well America death rate matter long them. kids started back Wednesday Indiana.

False narrative push lack coordination agencies caused slowed reaction attack

It much BLM due Biden‚Äôs VP pick. Democrats (who would considered conservative countries) pressure protesters fall line. agree you. However, sports bring people happiness entertainment. politics Fauci ever even hinted at, let alone expressed? think that's semantic splitting hairs.

People alive right soft. Wouldn‚Äôt mind losing sizable percentage them. horse long bolted friend. isn‚Äôt even news. Even one resistant individual slows disease. It‚Äôs well understood math.

It‚Äôs also dumb, since almost nowhere reached 40% infected. It‚Äôs agarbage article rightwing hacks. Yes indeed, live India. logical explanation high immunity low mortality figures could correct. Chennai currently, one areas badly hit... figures (both them) line happening rest world. add up. Patience appreciate drop-off ballot box idea that's floated. going vote person. Would say floating away less likely dead packages breath. wash package treat thee chicken food like number nasties. cross's contaminate whole kitchen, cook properly, wash hands touching surfaces touched. Normal food hygiene. cant compare countries like that's, simple. Netherlands better Belgium Germany, less lockdown (than Belgium least). depends many things, ""had lockdown, yes no"". 10 articles says opposite xD close herd immunity!!!!!!! /s OK who's pooping shipping containers? :P think conflating ideology personal philosophy Yeah get it. There's thousands excess deaths nothing else plausible explain it.

""Oh would died either way"" - erm, no. That's exactly called ""excess"" deaths. posted before, repost since seems relevant topic:

Rinsing fresh produce water currently recommended hygiene practice. suspect ineffective:

Viral load somewhere 10^3 10^11 per ml saliva (DOI 10.1101/2020.06.08.20125484).

### Contamination Risk
No one wears masks food production. Licking fingers plastic bag opening sneezing, coughing wet speaking onto food common cultural practice supermarkets around world. one item unlikely contaminated, consume many dozens week. rather low risk per item adds up.

Therefore reasonable hedge deposit food 10^9 virus copies, 10^11 accounting intentional spitting. Minimum infectious dose estimated 10^2 10^3 respiratory viruses way lower binding transmission rate.

### Inactivation Factors
Rinsing fresh produce water reduce 10^2, perhaps 10^4 scrubbing thoroughly, risk aerosolization. Colour saliva, let dry fresh produce, try wash off, believe factor.

Reduction time varies extremely different surfaces environmental conditions:

* refrigerator temperature, reasonable assume almost reduction since production (DOI 10.1128/aem.02291-09).
* coronaviruses, sterilization times varied hours months different types food (DOI 10.1371/journal.pone.0178094).

### Active Mitigation
As food-grade 70% alcohol might reliably penetrate mucus deposits, heat disinfection near-boiling water well-ventilated space seems reasonable method.

### Alternative Outcomes
I total layman this, would happy wrong.

But see official statements eerily similar mask dismissal February.

I would recommend treating food main source infection, unless one following bullet points proven true:

* Real-world Sars-Cov-2 decay fast food types.
* Mask wearing effective alcohol-based hand hygiene food production supermarkets becomes norm.
* Mouth throat contact needs high viral doses infection. Chewing result infectious dose inhaled aerosol/dust.

Your take this, especially virologist, welcome. know lot women quit jobs manage distance learning. Imagine ones can‚Äôt afford that. guts say online ? Make weekly please, show off. lol

Rent isn‚Äôt problem (and I‚Äôm paying them) couldn‚Äôt live alone circumstances anymore. incredibly amusing dark fashion much new century mapping old.

America already long pointless war, pandemic, looking forward economic depression, slipping towards fascism.

Its 1920s Part 2 Electric Boogaloo. UK also massively markup numbers end April include care home deaths pandemic, regardless whether confirmed covid related not? significant increase reported numbers despite almost certainly inflated.

You're talking overall numbers undercounted, given every single country experienced covid, specifically reason discussed thread. course overall numbers undercounted becuase sheer volume unknowns, unavoidable point, narrowing areas control/analyse much better understanding numbers reasonable do.

In case, clear criteria reporting deaths flawed deaths following positive test counted towards total, anyone half brain see accurate so.

Just overall numbers clearly underreported, mean ignore clear inaccuracies ""oh well, numbers much higher anyway, might well leave in"". may right saying make UK look better, also accurate say make numbers accurate supposed representing. millennial coming school October.. man can't catch break. I'm sorry. can't hear noise 250,000 motorcycles South Dakota. think many people reacting way don‚Äôt think they‚Äôll directly affected. I‚Äôve seen people say, ‚ÄúWhen see type people getting virus, don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm susceptible.‚Äù context think code for, ‚ÄúI think poor people get this.‚Äù Which...is ridiculous. News: ""This in: Tropical storm Josephine upgraded Cat. 3 hurricane, en route coastal Florida hitting land within next 8 hours.""

Parents: ""Hey kids, better put hurricane gear outdoor classes! School starts hour!"" sake, hope Jim Dickskin isn‚Äôt name top resume :) agree system designed keep people edge. unfortunate unfair... 

But social mobility still possible. Hard, yes, possible. 

I went state college too, worked min wage thru college, graduated '15, debt free (no cc student loan debt), good job non-stem field. context: immigrant, 28F, recently naturalized. get $ family pay for...anything, really. 

Again-- living US, planning, manageable. US people equipped it. lack basic financial literacy.

Credit used extension one's income -- sometimes even necessary. mean, using credit housing, feeding family, much needed expenses? Unfortunate understandable. Using credit frivolous non-necessities? Dumb. judging, I've there, sustainable.

Also, US, people feel need masters, phds, etc etc get good job return investment post-grad education laughable. 

All quite unfortunate. Still, countries worse. Believe me, come one.

sorry typos- typing one hand im recovering injury. Ah. see mean. Thanks informing Tl;Dr get fucking flu vaccine Florida serfs gotta work, state broke. Australian here. say we've *controlled* per se; Victoria's midst second wave full lockdown flatten curve - mandatory masks, curfew, works - hopefully enough. numbers huge compared yours, maybe 10% population. yes, problem complacent crayon-eating conspiracy theorist Karens do. gonna skyrocket lifted restrictions results people killing parents grandparents despite deaths entirely preventable, guarantee it. hear democratic hoax gonna november 3rd deleted less ten minutes, say? course it‚Äôs gonna worst fall long time, covid isn‚Äôt even last fall. Though Spanish flu levels bad, perhaps worse swine flu 1968 flu age groups. TX, FL, CA, Arizona tristate, worst virus swept sizable percentage population significant people immunity, aren‚Äôt hard hit states rough fall.   hopefully whenever goes he'll get lump sum.

This we‚Äôre holding for! I‚Äôm really really hoping isn‚Äôt even absurdities whenever finally get worked (‚Äúoh, system says spent day Mars withhold extra $600 dollars‚Äú), I‚Äôm exactly optimistic. 

Thank solidarity venting, though! ridiculous many levels. Senate thing just...*flames*. Flames side face! Kids don‚Äôt know social distancing means. Go local baseball field see mandates doing. Coaches umps wearing masks supposed enforce SD, 2nd inning, it‚Äôs window, literally see every day I‚Äôm local ball field. Someone bother Spanish Flu homework, they?

1st wave: mild flu

2nd wave: killed within 24 hours symptoms, 100,000 dead one month. 

Yes, viruses _usually_ become less deadly mutation, pandemic situations multiple infection pools widespread transmission, perfect recipe 100 weaker mutations become flu 3 turn killers, 3 get passed coast coast ignorant masklessmen matter days. 

Armchair biology leads pretty dangerous assumptions. Saw poll showed average American thinks 20% population 9% died. reality less 1% 0.01% died.

Thats media fear mongering action Everyone else finally experiencing everyday life Millennial. replying comment. like replying comment. keep insisting replying comment? LOL  Says guy spearheads fear mongering.

Okay, Fauci. Check math. conversion x per 1,000 100,00 factor 10. multiplying x 100, 1,000. host good replication.

It whole host dumbshits. currently ICU ventilator. Lol Hang there. I‚Äôve also depressed. you‚Äôre us take time deal thanks FMLA. won‚Äôt pay salary pay medical insurance. Reading headlines r/coronavirus ‚Äútrying informed.‚Äù 

Most things inaccurate get upvoted agree hivemind sub actual scientific studies get downvoted disagree hivemind. failure mods actually mod, creates subreddit misinformation runs rampant. 

This sub biggest driver covid misinformation world. 

Would say people get covid information Q Anon posts 4chan ‚Äútrying stay informed‚Äù? 

Of course not. 

But let guess, ‚Äúthat‚Äôs different‚Äù. 

But isn‚Äôt. Misinformation misinformation matter misinformation supports incorrect beliefs not. People cities. Liberals, Democrats, people color. Kushner thought let spread started affect ‚Äútheir people‚Äù. like new Democrat governor NC came in, suddenly GOP state house pass bill restricting governor's powers. Hmmmm wonder get many South Koreans trying come over. Definitely ‚Äúhaha funny‚Äù, like ‚Äúdid someone leave stove on? Smells funny here...‚Äù üòÇ

Damn!

One Christmas even hiked Granite Mtn. like 75 sunny, year totally snow-covered.

I never forget first day summer Valley, still getting stuff new place wanted outdoor furniture, course also sold outdoors. promptly plopped chair umbrella 114¬∞ heat ready punch daylights first living thing came near me, though probably wouldn‚Äôt energy follow completely thought first article read Trump complaining shower heads hair satire...then saw sites...why suprised? good point. thing expect. discussion wife regarding driving crazy ""structure"" remote learning adhering helping went March June.

I said through, let's say January arguments sake. figure we'd like know handle aim three months rather SIT DOWN. TODAY. 9AM. HELP FINISH WORTHLESS WORKSHEET 1PM. SIT DOWN. AGAIN. 2PM. WORKSHEETS.

This way, there's always time course correction break smaller goals. There's time fun interesting digressions. Creativity. Imagination, problem solving. 

Also, way curious willing way give credit for. area house know with... told kids 8 5, btw, come they'd want do. Well went nuts - picked shelves, chairs, carpet, expect budget, buy (with help there, lol), even try put stuff together. 

If mess work? They'll learned average week worksheets metric based learning school. I'm saying testing rote memorization place, become now. that, they've made interesting subjects unbelievably boring wonder interest.  I'm Facebook, always thought Sweden used example failure. daughter 5 months old. already three visits in-laws one visit parents. Plus another one sister. absolutely situation calculated risk taking. parents decided 1% (or less) chance dying absolutely better 100% chance meeting granddaughter 2. question probably going make sound like mega asshole, past times I've gone grocery shopping I'm putting groceries trunk one homeless guy comes asking money. never wearing mask gets really close bubble. town mask ordenace enforced. normal times would usually give money carry cash ""coin shortages"". tell goes right next person loading groceries gets bubble mask on. ignore it? Would asshole/Karen told grocery store manager? I'm sure aware? Nice deflection. need work trolling skills. proving said. make believe. clear, calling stupid. Bring salty tears screams. fuel me. stop virus spreading. may healthy children carriers school goes back. seen pics schools gone back? though many places Illinois gone virtual? Yeah need fight salon access you‚Äôre bald. Cue Karen‚Äôs one hand, feel *some* sympathy industries utterly wrecked COVID. 

Guys, let's realistic. job line, often lose sight bigger picture. They've closed 5 months. end AMC theaters recover somehow. 

But remains course, absolutely atrocious decision. real fault lies let pandemic last 5 months. developed world already returning 'normal' Exactly, normalized mass deaths. people claimed flu shifted say 350 deaths December okay .‚Äù 350k death‚Äôs acceptable could‚Äôve million‚Äù Yah I‚Äôve WFH 6 months, person contact spouse, communication something company doesn‚Äôt want work usually WFH discouraged. remote hard person harder team everyone doesn‚Äôt understand it. Agreed, I‚Äôm saying risks promoted rather inaccurately headlines fear/ click bait. data posted suggests need focus virulent serotypes, kinds headlines don‚Äôt advance purpose. whip people frenzy rather unpack/discuss serotype that‚Äôs important making rational public policy decisions. odds 35 die spread serious infection others unless somehow L-strain (e.g ‚Äúsilent hypoxia‚Äù subtype). get frustrated people normally think critically get spun group think headlines contribute instead general hysteria rather taking moment say ‚Äúwait, different forms covid? what‚Äôs silent hypoxia? what‚Äôs serotype?‚Äù Best thing work could dump 40 hour week bullshit. work lab even hurrying, labwork assigned day could done 5 6 hours everything works well, stay even everything done. honestly know chill work there's nothing do. Tradition? I'm sure there's tons jobs people working whole time would efficient told ""Hey job responsibility. done (and done well/not half assed) go home."" 85% remember next November Eh, put /s, last year Massachusetts got snow, what, 3 4 times?

Climate change *very* apparent New England. remember used snow Christmas, bay used freeze every winter. Way ahead you. Literally. know monetary interest selling many vaccines possible right? Yes, sunlight kills it. exposure time key ingredient. *surprised pikachu* true! Get flu shot yeah good point honestly know that, knew ICUs per capita problem especially given many rural hospitals even single ICU bed all... assumed overall hospital beds case, good know least basic hospital beds per capita par cities. following comment sounds familiar care want soften language, abortion ending unique human life.

For someone who's pushing total ban abortion /r/conservative, time advocate ""relative low risk children"", sounds pretty hypocritical. think virus comes outside? Control minds! US, I'd gladly switch spots South Korea. There's still awful lot misinformation poor communication virus. good evidence spread much outside well common sense suggesting (like fomates) can't primary form spread it'd spreading much further.

The bottom line really lot good, consistent info spreads even still. certainly warm countries large amount spread cold ones don't, temperature alone. Sunlight (UV) kills it, instantly again, weather seem impact it.

The bottom line we're really sure say, outdoor transmission likely significant cause community spread. said, keep eye Sturgis. suspect strongly comes people acting irresponsibly whether they're outdoors indoors, US clearly biggest issue people ignoring spread vectors we've got worst spread. Yes never said anything ""Cooking food right temperature"", talking about? realize someone cough chicken cooked right? someone's wrapping food, they're carrying you, bagging it, etc.

This direct quote said, first comment made thread. clear enough? post explain exactly talking about? idea trying argue, nothing said misleading, clear.

Edit: clear, ""Assume"" again, made one comment well directly takes someone take food oven/pan/fryer, cough it, speak carrying you, etc. know people forget food handled (not lot, obviously) well cooked. go fryer directly someone's mouth, there's steps between.

Again, quite clear, nothing cooking food temperature. thing I've talking clearly food cooked, said, handled serving employees. Can‚Äôt stop that, right express opinion sub (wouldn‚Äôt allowed Covid-19 sub) ... usually someone eventually comes along corrects them. doesn‚Äôt bother me, personally, read lot. find interesting know people believe.  would love find family following procedures us let play with! Unfortunately, families know seem following procedures. go park least weekly, complex great walking paths green areas run around (and went hiking last week) keeping distanced anyone household. Inert?

The general definition is:

"" **Viruses** **living things**. **Viruses** complicated assemblies molecules, including proteins, nucleic acids, lipids, carbohydrates, nothing enter **living** cell. Without cells, **viruses** would able multiply. Therefore, **viruses** **living things**. ""

But course, something able procreate make not-alive... Like Jennifer Aniston... wealthy district gave person online option. 800 chose online 2800 chose person. 55% democrats too... people blindly following inept leaders trying claim Swedish citizens roaming around killing people, really believe case! quite sure virus cause. 

I trying lower argumentation match standard. see absurd nonsensical is? one person die covid defeated 18 years old girl pocket knife ? nasty ass flu bug

Ass flu sounds really terrible. attacks child job work? hope track people go directly jail. Let know America decides actually take virus seriously effective quarantine needs happen less one month, way thanksgiving, back schools, seeing movies, going ball games, dancing nightclubs. 

But dumbasses keep ignoring quarantine, never fucking this.

The people act like nothing bug bite lasting long everywhere else, they're really going accept sooner later, that's going go history books. ur forgetting they're closing tons polls areas want people able vote lol

kentucky shut hella polls primary  Judging username would‚Äôve assumed gin. Love monkey 47 Well least chew bubble gum breathe ventilator three months clock ticking. Two wrongs make right now? Deaths surpassed 200, 000 according mean actually true almost every state still sort shutdown?

Obviously complain state hasn‚Äôt done, part, states quite cautious reopening call Leatherface mind child responsible massacre Texans. Also whole disgusting face thing. Waiting fall wave I'm sorry, thats terrible. Stay safe I'm always saying burn DC shoot evey single politician sight. places closed since people ungrateful.

That's punishment everyone actions *""Karen""* service workers encounter people anyone else; let thin herd. grade level, made common ten day lesson plan case someone goes quarantine. But, next time? next? Sure. he's wearing mask time exposed people life could carrying disease.

Don't get upset when, matter public policy, really take word though. That's appeal authority. educated informed person, I'm analysis facts based mix reliable scientific sources frankly, CDC terrible job really trust them. say right, wrong. Much late wait things become ""evidence-based"" instead making best analysis knowledge available. example, think trying stop pandemic cloth masks *daft*. That's wear paint respirator P100 filters. ^^^nay That's choice parents special needs children face. Send lose services guaranteed federal law. shameful. Uhh don‚Äôt stay home, many people held back year could forget need celebrate Labor Day?? celebrate laborious efforts hard need extra week recover, even laborious next week need another 4 week recess. looks like wealthy suburb Atlanta. would guess pretty large chunk children families born there. think anything 'Southern' much stupid. guess we're already prepared going pandemic. guy gets it. hope majority Americans do, too. Also 2 week incubation period, I'd say expect 4-6 weeks latest outbreak reach higher level, mitigation states greatly affected, especially since travel country-wide impeded. Tracking unused ICU beds poor indicator bad virus actually is. Highest deaths daily far. Teaching done remotely. Principals understand classes like art music work. principals thought fine K4 class 5th grade class back back time between, plus 5th grade come end day straight recess bathroom break also bookbags packed ready leave. üôÑ

I friend teaches music elementary school 1000 kids. eight day rotation. teachers bring classes music room. No, go GET walk back classrooms. bars restaurants go bankrupt crowded. crowded eye beholder. economy took big hit despite lockdown -- many people stopped going spend money safe. Bros wanted arm teachers. long take executive branch use say covid-19 death counts misrepresented? So....would say COVID fatigue then? Since you‚Äôve stopped listening? 100s flatpack respirators, I'm taking guess picture.

Why making things instead sticking truth admitting keep trying poke holes study best study exhalation N95 valved masks. better data suggested lets see it.

I poke holes it. researchers said demonstration actual evaluation masks. plenty N95 / FFP2 / KN95 masks ear loops authorized FDA use healthcare.

No not, n95 respirators headbands, ear loops. seems confusing kn95 respirators n95 respirators.

Why keep making things trying lie job? fired pull together 9/11. Yeah first months perhaps Republicans squandered goodwill pointless, ridiculous war Iraq.

 That's disheartening. One problem may curriculum really lend independent learning home. 

Years ago homeschooled kids. first year public school program, using regular school textbooks. work well, books written classroom consumption - lectures, discussions, etc. 

After forged used homeschool-specific curricula. difference written *to student* interfacing material learn. parents help guide, student learns mostly independently, works built purpose. tons choices different learning styles, etc. 

If parent faced kids learn home, would really think switching actual homeschool reason. 

(This meant knock teachers, btw. *highly* value public school teachers. public school curriculum may well-suited home learning.) mean... we've used term ""go viral"" half generation...

You'd think we'd 'get it'.  insurance buys brand new yachts whoever sinks goes get COVID jail. Yeah, great plan. donated (saving tax hit). it‚Äôs recent coronavirus? two metrics don‚Äôt compare. I'm Australia, flu season shit would see third world country, can‚Äôt believe US fucking get it! possible money get sending kids school!? for!? education, food services teachers students top notch! even 3rd world countries thinking sending kids school forget economy! countries already little fraction USA has! fucking demonic! drum teacher appreciate Maroon 5 they‚Äôre band kids like real drums songs. bands rare days.

It‚Äôs money insurance case, might mean ‚Äúfirst harm‚Äù United States willing test effectiveness hydroxychloroquine covid patients, Russian vaccine covid patients. make sense? 

Why test Russian vaccine like one would test vaccine? lose? state outlawed covid lawsuits. kidding. absolutely fucking worthless.

Seriously, let guns one reason puss out! food service. kitchen backline, ass ankles. job pretty much taking precautions showy visible customers. even really make sense inconsistent, look safe outside. I'm pretty confident still help great deal. say air freely escape non-valved masks, air still exits around mask, complete seal keeping mask face exhale even elastic bands. Surgical masks even form complete seal normally, lot air escapes gaps, it. Valved masks anything better Valves, however, allow air exhaled hole material, meaning droplets blocked spreading others

Of course still blocked. People need keep mind work like probabilities, valved mask blocking large percentage droplets working working well. That's masks work anyway, surgical masks block large percentage transmission.

Also, given much effective valved masks tend protecting you, much less likely end spreading virus much less likely get sick. even then, masks still block exhaling, imperfectly.

Edit: looks like elsewhere thread people posted studies showing efficacy different mask types including valved N95 masks type scenario. Non-valved fitted N95 surgical masks still seemed better exhaling though. gym way necessity global pandemic. ""*mandate*"" - walk supposed Dr. note, good. Can't increase housing supply when:

Can't sprawl out. Can't grow up. California's 50-year *anti growth* attitude finally destroyed state. fight change it, prices climb, shortage increase, addicts normally live slums dumped onto streets (as slums go $1800 month). mean Trump‚Äôa executive order? go through? right Americans laughing stock free world. government thinks people It‚Äôs ‚Äúidiots‚Äù die people don‚Äôt vaccinate, it‚Äôs people can‚Äôt take vaccine medical reasons. don‚Äôt get we‚Äôre still confused species herd immunity. reminds canned Swiss air thats selling like hotcakes China

Btw didn‚Äôt CDC say air-born? Didn‚Äôt say droplet? Didn‚Äôt say Americans safe? Didn‚Äôt miss manage covid testing data early pandemic? also still! Didn‚Äôt screw early test kits twice broke rule? kept hearing Doctors CDC telling right information self educate using international sources.

CDC wrong items. shame. Well Mitch care.... Lindsay Susan Collins denial. dear leader busy destroying postal service rest republicans idea do. become tragic joke.   quite difficult disagree statement. quite logical hard refute.

I believe there‚Äôs one Covid now. So, everyone's great $1200 got four months ago, right?

*Fine. I'll show out.* due. needs happen. Peacefully. stay home. Yeah feel like best shot compliance making free... ugh frustrates me. Increasing risk people around and/or infecting take proper precautions does.

Not wearing mask increases risk people around X 

Wearing mask valve increases risk people around Y. 

We know X much larger Y. Therefore, someone wearing mask worse person one wears mask valve. 91% effectiveness

Effectiveness what? Based what? They're hoping 50% effectiveness. So... one party system last bastion democracy?

Many Northeastern states shut quite hard extent, still remain partially closed. Oh got wrong. kids matter either them. call man science, yet overwhelming majority scientists field epidemiology disagree you. already shared article scientists believe 70% population infected reach herd immunity. Additionally, Earth say lockdowns work studies show man science, know basics kind infections spread, know, aerosoled droplets, requires close proximity non-infected individual inhale order get infected. non essential businesses large gathering shut down, people going spend less time near other, therefore infected spreading fewer people. simple elementary 1 + 1 = 2. 

Come on, herd immunity unlikely consider things contributed slowing spread northeast. also admit France multiple countries also entitlement apathy problem? fact, important protect others protect wearer. Protecting wearer protects one person, protecting everyone else wearer... well, protects everyone else. makes good argument saying important protecting others

If ""others"" want protection go buy N95 KN95 like did. need protect them. everyone protected certified masks would better off. Oh good grief fault fool Chief can't wish away he's going ignore ""the thought flatten curve enough make go away unscientific"" like even proofread type? drinking right something? want kids/teachers sick even dead? correct, someone put gun head said eat half plate shit eat whole plate, much shit gonna eat?

Is reaction geared towards Abbott general warning COVID fatigue? South Carolina says drop testing lack trying ability. actually drop demand people seeking tested reflected article: vouch this.

I'm sure met stupid folks lifetimes, dunno I've ever met anyone would say ""yea, person would drink bleach someone saw TV suggested it"" ""take look Paris - Americans this""

Pls fucking stop kid. Nobody claimed that, arguing smells bad wrote know adequate protection insist using anyway, better dicknosers antimaskers.

In words, according you, person wears mask valve, someone refuses wear mask. English understanding ""you better than"" means. 

I telling **wrong**. 

A person wears mask valve **better than** someone refuses wear mask, mask valve lower probability spreading covid. Also nice 5d old bot account Everyone it, know likely raise chances getting infected clinic go every day, required medical professionals lower mask speaking them. pinch middle side mouth carefully pull up. 

People drink sometimes out, too, eat requires pull mask down. health systems US non-profit.

On slightly serious note, noticed lot essential workers seem best job keeping masks on. woman Wal-Mart Auto Center remove mask every time wanted say something. 80% people lose weight gain back within year two voices internet say sooo easy yeah. LOL need disclose students virus.

They let students/faculty share classrooms known cases may exposed.

Now work cluster fuck hallways, that's sane school districts holding physical classes. There's way accurately contact trace. Wearing mask admitting virus real. can't handle it.

This good point. Tacking this, think kind person cannot handle even slightest bit nuance uncertainty. either nothing worry whatsoever, cowering fear. well risk statistics, unsettled scientific questions, modifying actions reduce risk everyone societal goal. people decided nothing worry whatsoever, they're angry seeing masks people assume cowering fear. holy shit. I'm sorry situation Vegas week Defcon last year (not it), sounds right. He's going make anti mask mandate force mayors sue instead. Meantime they're zero enforcement. Hell, also south, acquaintance posted picture kids masks school FB. One idiot comments saying ""they wearing that"" calls mother ""rude"" tells mom knows best. proceeds say ""don't get mad"" ""masks restrict oxygen developing brains, giving facts!"". people biggest fucking snowflakes called publicly lambasted. Months ago, naively excited wearing masks sick flu season would become normal would nice silver lining.  post-viral fatigue brutal accounts. Glad hear mend.

This one times. completely put aside fact Trump administration charge disaster - that's easy.  Instead look he's done said throughout crisis. genuinely difficult imagine worse person charge this. absolutely constant stream misinformation, downplaying, straight lying top, filling complete void anything even resembling national plan. good leader leads example allows change opinion presented evidence. Every good manager boss I've ever shared qualities. try emulate employees. Trump zero pandemic. spent drastically critical months early middle stages crisis refusing ever wear mask (and fucking day, approaching 6 month mark, seen publicly wearing one ONE FUCKING TIME) sticking since-corrected initial stance Fauci/CDC masks. spent months hocking unproven, dangerous, eventually totally debunked miracle cure virus. argues reduction testing every single expert said since day 1 testing necessary. demanded reopenings across country level spread clearly low enough, paid price tens thousands dead. he's stopping. still never wears mask, he's demanding schools reopen despite even less satisfactory level spread, keeps saying problem disappear, etc.

Blaming Trump crisis going easy him. response merits absolute evisceration every possible opportunity. LITERALLY could worse. Compared healthcare costs long-term Covid-19 damage, even counting billions day damage economy, pocket money. assuming immunity long lasting. sure enough data support that. read paper sited, might wrong Black people ""hood"" ""ghetto"" often react aggressively perceived slights feel disrespect. That's often see youtube videos people pranks ghetto outlandish reactions. Also alot kids sick dying yet close schools Americans think 9/11 biggest disaster is? even come close top I'm sure America messed things much worse 9/11. (Hiroshima &amp; Nagasaki?!?)

Prior COVID *five* significant pandemic threats actual pandemics since 2000:

1. SARS 2003. Highly deadly, stamped major effort.

2. H5N1 (mid-2000s). Highly deadly adapted efficiently mammals, still around.

3. 2009 H1N1. Actual flu pandemic flu strain reassortment pig, turned mild. 

4. MERS (2012-present). Highly deadly quite efficient enough humans. Outbreaks suppressed. 

5. H7N9 (2013-present). Highly deadly probably transmit mammals, target major Chinese poultry vaccine campaign.

(Just COVID cases). Supposedly. staff 468 additional high-needs patients? Probably not. 700 COVID related ER visits every single day, yesterday 732, slow day. current stats, things turn ever slightly worse, would max remaining ICU inpatient beds less week, that's say nothing would actually attending patients. see numbers, people reassured them, nothing worry about! almost 2800 available ventilators, 4000 inpatient beds, 740 ICU beds (only 468 staged adults, worry that)! Look resources! Stop worrying, movie theaters reopen? Seems quite stressful job‚Ä¶ Huge fucking NO, that's exactly wants look. 



1. order bankrupt many already ultra poor states



2. (or least corporations sucked couple trillion aid) plenty money continue 600 federal. Cutting half based entirely feelings without attempt even explain cut. 


3. president power purse cannot allocate funds like this. either wont happen, laws longer meaning country more. That's dictatorship. 


4. ever obvious propaganda strategy used united states republicans here? Ignore dems bill months, pretend negotiate unpassable ""deal"" last minute, blame dems lack releif/compromise, let orange idiot swoop much biggly smart brain alpha male energy plan save day pretending democrats fault to. Republicans score political points among idiots can't see happened, american people continue suffer. 


5. poor enough, get assistance. 


6. guy never never anything interest american people, cheap bit political showmanship different.


7. funding comes FEMA. Global warming real, start hurricane season. math. somehow goes through, many die direct result.


8. order lasts 1.5 months. Virus gone easter y'all. It'll go away like things go away. Especially schools opening. full agreement you! trying remember last time got food delivered me, think 10+ years ago. Pizza football game. Honestly can't believe much people paying. 

BUT, make choice. cook food, even go get restaurant food, pay someone bring them. absolutely 0 reason grumpy something intentionally. obvious going happen late february/early march, sprain wrist patting back. 

You find result alone, unless highly effective nearly universal, may small effect (but still nontrivial, terms absolute lives saved) severe epidemics, ongoing epidemic New York state. 

Sure seems like saying mask wearing needs universal me, compliance symmetry uncertainty, potential benefit, lack obvious harm, precautionary principle lead us strongly recommend close universal (homemade, unless medical masks used without diverting healthcare supply) mask use general public possible.

That conclusion seems saying opposite are... Misunderstood comment. Nevermind. Phew! site dumb. less try understand logic reddit, better be.

In case everyone aware, hold much money give people need it. No, hold things extra usually totally unrelated pet project crap sides always shove bills. Maybe Democrats holding money Kennedy Center, Republicans want new waterboard tables, either way American people get screwed.  like, Hey! know! We'll keep dumb shit praying different results! Getting fatter every year tends that. think there‚Äôs combo ant-vaxxerism, well reasonable concern longer term side-effects vaccine that‚Äôs rushed market political reasons. take reasonable amount time, right, hopefully people buy vaccine.

That said, previous years would much rather buy kids candy want call night, lol. Unfortunate gets job done awesome screw everyone else, screw scientists experts, going whatever want decided take proper precautions?

Yes. Wholeheartedly. would I? failed massively. called March COVID-19 spreads via aerosols people wear masks, took long time come around that. I'm going see modeling study argues asymmetry protection matter. course, limitations modeling studies, find result intuitive.  mean Mike Pence? Agreed. Constituents, lovely Senator home sure.

But $165 k/wk pays something like 30 consultants give take. cost arrogance. dont get it...

No one forces enter mask mandatory business 

You wear mask get pass..even worn half ass probably glad complying...though dont agree that

Your mask keeps everyone safe you, dont think might spreading covid without knowing must first human back mars

It's almost like separate virus....Sarsehole 19 call it...and roughly 40 percent us it

Symptoms include: red hat, Confederate flag shirt, morbid fear printed material Lets wipe question mark foreheads. increasing sense government lacks integrity whatsoever, happy talk vaccine occurring order advance political objective.    
As far I'm concerned, matter tabled least Nov 4th. new TV helps stimulate economy, know, thing keep freaking isn‚Äôt happening. Says everyone sane United States dummy. r/threadkillers predict next pandemic come amazon rainforest e.g., go shopping inside store, catch nasty stares people end /r/publicfreakout Oh, we‚Äôre strong, it‚Äôs system strength. Recall all! Fools  good read CDC don‚Äôt know shit mental health. Let‚Äôs lock world, tell months later nothing, take away job, get unemployment while, take bunch old fucks can‚Äôt agree ya, money there. People can‚Äôt pay shit, getting evicted left right, CDC sheds light mental help? 

Fuck train want get off, fuck CDC. much help one legged man ass kicking contest beyond protest. could also argue 9/11 partially due bad corrupt leadership, George Bush's cabinet warned many times impeding terrorist attack. government also planned past similar scenario unfold, taken serious enough Yes also massive protests lot people didn‚Äôt wear masks. disinfection theatre

Oooh great! I've heard ""security theatre"" used far, ""disinfection theatre"" much tighter. Fuck GOP cycle repeats Alright, let's see data contradicting CDC since base claim trying deviate from.

Whataboutism, insisting two wrongs make right help get us pandemic.

And head CDC, lying? Regional general strikes would help, too, think. majority Americans can't handle truth responsibly. think would happen government said ""masks effective, hoard we're short healthcare workers priority"" - we'd hoard them. That‚Äôs part mean said making easier run office. witch-hunt mentality major media stop social media crackdown conspiracy bullshit that‚Äôs easy spread. general populace got stop acting like someone something dumb teenage years disqualifies holding office 30+ years later. It‚Äôs madness. get $169 rent $800. super awesome. that's 1 bill. fucked up. know Notre Dame predicted this? Tax hit? think main way I've staying sane 6 miles foot per day + hanging wife. Even then, relative isolation messing Exactly would them. said nothing good? $600 much - mean think everyone get zero. again, Pelosi shot idea $600 extended talks over. Wouldn‚Äôt even allow vote it. personally think $400 least based salary - little incentive go back work. Like $250/week go back work. idea floated Republicans. 

But giving someone making $12/hr $20/hr unemployment doesn‚Äôt make sense. There's definitely T-cell cross reactivity providing protection percentage population, there's also genetic factors involved disease severity, higher percentage population exposed 1st waves slower subsequent waves spread.  However, personal opinion, drop hard hit areas due changes human government behavior. people hard hit areas much likely experiencing first hand devastating virus changed behavior (more masks, social distancing, better hygiene). Also, governments hardest hit areas rigorous enforcing public health laws slowest reopen. think there's moral component changes all, learned response avoid adverse consequences.  stick hand hole hurts change behavior stop sticking hand hole. Oxford's vaccine (and Moderna's) likely two dose series shots uncommon routine vaccines. second dose cover seroconvert first shot, routine, specific set individuals. Hi Charlie. need name check small.

Kind like covid.... lol least Sheev got rid religious zealots brought peace empire. would vaccinated individual wear mask MOFO's deserve kind fucking break right now. actual fuck. Gerrymandering, voter suppression, large checks pretty powerful turns out. people downvoting this? sarcastic? Ahh, somehow missed ""lol"" first pass. event, I'm curious cold transmission like, also, flu transmission like fall. works. week two suddenly huge spike cases understand I‚Äôm gonna get downvoted this, August recesses aren‚Äôt really ‚Äúbreaks‚Äù traditional sense. congresspeople use recess meet constituents home districts hold meetings town halls. 

Although fair doubt much pandemic. Hospitalizations lagging indicator. Honestly, determines whether buy house Canada going based next election. Movin up, maybe Found Stanford grad lmao Actually think they've sidestepped liability giving parents teachers choice. students county registered, choose either brick mortar virtual learning. making parents make choice would seem make liability non-issue say, Hey, gave option, knew risk, made choice. Though, knowledge liability law, that's best assessment. Ok, let's see data labeled reliable author actually tests n95 mask instead apparatus study referred tested counterfeit n95 mask.

I cannot provide data counter data yet provide. anybody called Family Services start investigation principal Superintendent? No. Masks. ü§∑ reminder GOP trying steal election likely we'll revolt try declare treasonous corrupt fuckstick winner again. people want big red ""return pre-virus normal"" button pressed done for.

If try explain button exist get really angry aggressive. personally like term volunforced agree like 4th break since pandemic started. Look understand guys positive cases post trying say, albeit screwed I'm drinking, need vaccine else keep popping everywhere. mention fact least one large district AZ, options are:

1.	In person attendance, masks ‚Äòrequired‚Äô (parents exempt student requirement reason, doctors note)
2.	Online education option ineffective widely known borderline useless. (It‚Äôs give students fail class).

This forces students attend person, one wants deal shit-tier online option year. 20 teachers resigned, former high school (graduated year) begins person classes within next week. 

Shitshow. Thanks that. got ton replies I'm sure appreciate taking time respond :) Ohhh makes sense, that's awesome!!! Thanks explaining:) Omg username funny. feel like we‚Äôve crossed paths trashy reality tv subs. wonderful insight US Morona outbreak real time Tyler Durden would proud. knew guy super annoying Boston accent. Every time wanted say something really mean he‚Äôd preface ‚Äúsorry guess I‚Äôm politically correct. said whatever stupid/cruel thing wanted he‚Äôd say again.  point whoever listening wasn‚Äôt supposed correct question were, guess sensitive. Ironic nobody could question without flying handle. Nope, read side it. list covid specifically things says surface must remain wet 10 minutes least. bigger issue immunocompromised people hospitals overrun. Meaning simply medical care basically anything, includes car crashes, accidental injuries, bad fevers pains, sudden attacks condition, elective surgeries i.e. surgeries schedule advance. 
That's really bad thing everyone. ‚ÄúWe found [National Institutes Health] much, much better question people come save time, temperatures notoriously inaccurate many times,‚Äù Fauci said

You assuming accurate enough catch 1 5. Also, keep mind people line temperatures checked keeps close proximity long enough spread covid others. And, person check everyone's temperature especially risk scenario. humans invade ecosystems come closer animals, corona nothing compare future pandemics politicized NYU Columbia gotten memo.  That's okay want pay bills month. worry I'm sure able next month either since shit. know effect sure makes life living hell. Oh whew. thought like anti vax shit concerned. bad there

Like thought saying dang even get it‚Äôs going struggle also heavily politicized sense. country board whatever took make people responsible pay, second person dissented (Jon Stewart easy example) mainstream ""bomb everything! ask questions later!"" quickly labeled anti-american putting lightly, much worse things said era. one job measured 85-90 every single day. Maybe bought garbage thermometers though idk lol Best plan move state strong squatters rights. strange statement. Many diseases produce changes body temperature, never determine disease person measuring body temperature. humans make thermometers? body temperature indicator help diagnose. Compared asymptomatic people, people elevated body temperature likely infected virus. Let undergo PCR tests find actually infected COVID-19. Compared national test, test scope smaller. Compared PCR test, test simpler convenient, tested anywhere, infected person found quickly.

However, regardless whether temperature test useful not, United States need use strategy. already many infected people United States. Sources? Neck carries 1 cc dick  would worse spreader, worse person. bad refusing anything protect people around them. Wearing mask protects selfish wearing mask thinking hoax.

Motive matters. come across dozens accounts... early April. 2 recent accounts China last couple days  hurt ? Seriously asking Elected representatives people suddenly can‚Äôt buy groceries without help... walk away problem? employees, guys. Fire them. never knew many people believed Trump became president. people lie taxes take advantage every program ‚Äúone them‚Äù bad things happen them. people actually need programs don‚Äôt lie get them, ‚Äújust lazy‚Äù agree. time something vent social media reddit etc. Protesting petitions SOMETHING. Idk I'd whatever could. unreal. feel like food packaging significant transmission vector would LOT sick people, especially places poor mask adherence. missing? yes, going Oxfords phase 1 results understand sample size small looks 91% effective vaccine, saying vaccine theoretically still wear mask polite aren‚Äôt risk personally mean? Buy gun train it.

What said educated you‚Äôre eating really crux meant. It‚Äôs important us try build legitimate understanding science tell us nutrition instead listening lifestyle blogs. 

Thanks callout! legitimately helpful. Fuck US honestly. Money hungry pieces shit. can‚Äôt listen expert, DONT POLITICIZE CORONAVIRUS. Also stop pretending it‚Äôs t**** supporters problem, know damn well people sides aren‚Äôt need Damn... Wise decision. pitiful salary risking life (and family's life) over. Sounds lot complicated ""only employees store, put order in, wait curb line"". Good work!! It‚Äôs better Berkeley, equal Princeton, Harvard, Yale. pretend reading issue  already know study talking about. referring Duke demonstration new testing procedure.

If read it, say demonstration purposes only, data reliable.

Now, lying? 

And real data study read understood, going keep parroting headlines?  100% this. People always blaming ""politicians"" ""Washington"". Republicans problem pretty irresponsible lump everyone together Republicans. government give everyone $1200 month we're quarantine period. President Trump squandered early lead this. Literally threw away. good, highest local case count while. I'm sure they'll get control though.  would increase value...

Should suspend recess circumstances (like today)? Absolutely. House already passed bill, 100% Republicans twiddling thumbs. Understatement year! taking appeal authority. basing decade experience aviation safety inspector industrial hygienist. basing schilerian videos different types masks respirators.

Please share data claim backs wild claim CDC wrong, list qualifications make input valuable CDC, someone actually trained dealing sorts CBR threats related PPE.

I basing statements data author behind says use testing counterfeit masks even identify.

Or admitting thing basing claims study understand? ignore science send kids school sUfFeR hOmE /s mean 93.8F temp work accurate?  Nothing wrote relevant point. 

Do disagree shifting resources towards places covid cases right thing do? Why?!?!? never good enough, people brainwashed think anything said online anything progressive. anything, circlejerk people ideas. US already pre-ordered 800 million doses coronavirus vaccines cover ~330 million people. CDC made claim data! 

Thank finding study! Maybe CDC needs see it.  eat sushi deli meats right debates read conversation convinced ‚ÄúJesus changing Trumps heart abortion. God‚Äôs chosen leader.‚Äù still don‚Äôt understand many people read respond ‚Äúthis true!!‚Äù Maybe keep becasue going give paid vacation?  Eff all. Republicans could done more, Democrats could accepted less. need bullshit dem demands once. 

Or maybe Mitch nothing stance protecting companies liability. Absolutely bullshit. That's better argument valved N95 masks. really know holds true across valved N95 masks though (is part standard?)

Let's look CDC actually said though -- statement valved masks general.  recommend allow unfiltered air exhaled -- leading transmission water droplets air around wearer.

Keep mind CDC trying balance recommendations well. cannot recommend everyone wear N95 masks, even best way individual protect themselves, we'd masks matter days. far know, they're still asking people use N95 masks unnecessarily reason.

They recommend clothe masks best protection, they're available protection still slow transmission rates \*enough\*.

Your goal get best protection. CDC's goal protect public large. I'm saying opposing goals, they're going result advice. Glad got hazard pay either... Stimulus checks would 250billion + 100 billion unemployment insurance. together less trillion

do give Democrats leeway. failed compromise. wanted big paydays donors refused budge well. 

Vote incumbents office, R   Mitch McConnell get stupid.

His ass reported though ethics line hr bosses boss hate state hate Governor them. Every single fucking one. Yea man.... look Dems wanting make suffer pushing expansion unemployment benefits, increased Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits, increased funding utilities payments job training low-income individuals, 25% increase aid disabled veterans additional $1200 stimulus check per individual. Absolutely despicable. GOP Dems respect us money sent unemployed, less spent therefore causing economic loss.... Less groceries, less traveling, less everything means less tax local governments...

No idea things true, widespread are, would occurring tho. Republican values‚Ñ¢

Now go sit let grown ups talk. don‚Äôt believe word misguided info! eating anytime soon Ya don‚Äôt fucking say? Tbc, one side worse other. Republican intransigance staple since Obama administration even Democrats bent backwards compromise. They've said loud multiple times they're interested making Democrats look bad actually getting things done. 

There's reason believe that's suddenly changed. D'aaawwww love amigo I‚Äôve noticed people social media who‚Äôve really good whole time started breaking‚Äî going dinner, traveling.

Are kidding me? Jesus. Fucking. Christ. LEFT embraces gun ownership. (Move far enough left get guns back). mean democrats/liberals center-right. Food stamps exist pissed honest. really counting 2nd stimulus. I'm ""essential worker"" single mom 2 kids ineligible assistance. Full time covid made hard. Bringing home less $1000 month able pay bills. rent gas food daycare. (Luckily utilities can't turned off..yet. ETA: I'm able borrow future paychecks otherwise wouldnt even able pay much)

Every ailment seems potentiality covid one kid gets sick miss work doctor see provide note still pay daycare unable attend. 

With school partially reopening I'm looking $700 daycare (eldest dad last 9weeks). hours getting cut 20 week. Again...I'm eligible housing assistance food stamps daycare assistance anything. kids get free medicaid pay insurance able do. 

I'm struggling. funny Chappelle, ""cloned"" Chappelle? Kids hit hard among 1st sent home, work, didnt go nursing homes, can't go bars, can't gather bunch friends etc. 

They exposed least demographic. Apparently neither democrats. make partisan issue, everyone's fault.  multi-faceted, reckon.

1) meat industry lot money lawyers 'counter-research', imagine position want back from. reckon research group considered topic got sternly worded letter lawyer paid cargill, national beef, tyson, smithfield, JBS, purdue... mention processing companies like archer-daniels-midland on. companies slaughterhouses meat-packing plants hotbeds right first place absolutely find whatever make libel case would high-profile lash it.

2) previous studies food-bourne pathogens sanitation tend work labs real world scenarios, prove people perfect. kitchen sink often salmonella e-coli 257:H7 toilet. [it's bacteria require bleach clean spreading raw meat, tbh, unless treating raw meat science experiment, people mishandle raw meat daily basis. jury SARS-CoV-2 vs bacteria, course, notion 'improper handling' one meat industry used cover ass food outbreaks salmonella.

3) important case virus reacts raw meat, long takes die long takes slaughter shipment, probably. would probably take priority, steers clear meat industry lawyer problem. Yeah - give people's money BACK?!?

Now, Hell supposed steal THAT?!? Lul saw too, thought brilliant directing certain people America. Stephen Colbert also brilliant year. Sounds like he's past point return. That's lie. Dems willing compromise. ing come third, example.

You getting misinformation somewhere. He'll break 40%, bet break 44% that's really approval rating ceiling throughout presidency Criticism something different completely it. hard comprehend that. okay critical things. Free speech good. antibody tests ny already prove blacks hispanics infected expressing disease. 70% antibodies cf whites spend day trying dismiss Duke pre-print unless actual data contest it, still best have. calling valved n95 equivalent counterfeit saying even counterfeit valved mask better cloth masks.

Anyway I'm still waiting actual data, know data attached academic research paper. fuck republicans.

Zebra here! refrigerated freight stands turn world head. many Pacific asian countries trying prevent community spread together, banning cold freight heavily infected regions creating produce trade bubble seems like sensible mitigation strategy. lucrative countries excess primary produce managed virus well. bad countries let virus go. libs seem want rob students year education. Many students teachers get sick fine. Yes, getting flu twice row. point subsequent infections appear increase severity symptoms. totally believe them. spot entire time done terrific job helping keep us prepared. 
/ssssssssssssssss screams haunt mother end days.

Apparently saved chopped up. Another kid screaming getting done shortly meant parents opted (it default time). Louie runs virtually uncontested district. think big deal might politicians. Louie Gohmert represents district. epitome district. Pathetic! know traah headline sure 20 countries supposedly ordered Philippines likely use it. appreciate it, thanks Since rona isn‚Äòt even year old, could say it‚Äòs experimental. 

And arguing known medical circles. general public tho? get temp taken prior reporting shift work. regularly get results low 90s drove AC car...... like even get good wholesome news sub people like always ruin everyone. Deal Novavax candidate. They're really spreading eggs many baskets can. 2 cases Melbourne Australia Americold facility past two weeks well, ship NZ Americold location? holla! watched part 5:30 briefing, simply said strain previously seen NZ. Unless arose Q&amp;A, presume still believe one UK strains? Lmao Fauci talking about. Americans managed politicise even Covid! see thread Democratic Americans blaming Trump, Republicans still refusing wear masks cause think hoax. 

It's like Covid Americans something bash about. whole world laughing you. Republicans. Literally created laws horrible '‚ÄúThis study confirms reinfections coronavirus type occur time window shorter 1 year, finds significant association repeat infections symptom severity,‚Äù researchers concluded. Investigators recommend analyses involving viral sequencing serological testing order confirm repeated infections disentangle effects antigenic drift antibody waning. also suggest studies analyzing genetic basis individual response coronavirus infections.'

Worth mentioning they're basing research endemic Coronaviruses affected us past, SARS-CoV-2. really worried reinfection, we'd worrying amount reinfections popping around globe already.

My hypothesis cases China reactivation PCR test tripped dead virus fragments, mentioned article. reinfections mean actually get sick again? That's Nice! belgian got like 40‚Ç¨ (once) local businesses -.- Realistically governments really without going full dystopia locking tracking bracelets people? That's good question. I'll see find article disqualifications. read quite ago Fuck yeah, home state  announced 5.30pm briefing, 4 hours later correct. anti maskers brains may explode faced costume quagmire, maybe I'm Canada think far... I'm wondering...


Will we? we?


My kid starting school 2 weeks I'm overly worried, 2 months school mid October data decide...


Added: ""data"", ""politics"" ""religion"", we're Canada... Worth read, investigated four common cold coronaviruses assumes covid might similar. suspected recent cases reinfection would line people immune one year average lose immunity months, two years.

And panic, please, affect vaccines. UK one many places virus made small significant mutation. strain traveled world. doesn‚Äôt necessarily imply infection directly person UK, although could also. fly planes Ah sweet. TIL Sorry. getting real impatient end since arguing thing.. Kinda. 

I wonder rona impairs cognitive functions badly - know common cold does.. hella dumb couldn‚Äôt concentrate shit it. Would interesting know weeks! That's one. got downvoted hell saying would never happen publicity stunt government.

Who's laughing lol. course ‚Äúwait‚Äù, currently set time ‚Äúwait‚Äù for. articles coming saying stuff like ‚Äúwe need distance even vaccine‚Äù understand people giving since hasn‚Äôt light end tunnel 6 months. means 50 buildings blown tore ever since march.

My response never said jack volunteering wanting school person, ever. flipping something never said angry people saying that. one people. 
So would volunteer school also know parents voting return school class also would not. would miss yoga class did. birds make journey NZ, coming far Alaska. read birds here: UK would almost certainly indicate returned traveler, doubt much shipped UK New Zealand. seen couple stories Promed reinfected people China.

Thank jolt motivation Nope, they'll able impact risk family members spread throughout state. Maybe try look bigger picture bud Cuomo said past ~600 new cases per day need least 3,000 tracers handle caseload within 48hrs

5 contact tracers every case means US would needed 300,000 contact tracers peak 72,000 new daily cases. That's roughly 1% country working full-time contact tracers, say nothing administrative public health apparatuses required support workforce. big flu outbreak year last. teachers sick kept cramming kids gym supervised dwindling staff. :/

I think they're desperate subs year. They've spamming ads local FB pages trying find them. I've never seen before. Many us don‚Äôt really care say anything point. short, fuck right WHATEVER spout. Informed citizens don‚Äôt look information kind.  Police country useless. friend murdered half town knew even regularly called detective still took almost two years arrest guy even hiding. Remindme! 18 days surprising negative news? knew would uptick cases whenever anything reopened. mean everything stay closed forever? No. need push harder reopening need sooner rather later. mandate masks, even without mandate need push move this.  surprised-pikachu-face.jpeg matter long takes show getting tested weekly. means test positive one week, one test misses it, next one get it.

The point is, people contagious symptoms, waiting test get sort waste time want spread others. Alcoholics. Can't stay home. 

If want control pandemic, make drinking illegal except home immediate family members. Lol there‚Äôs one thing I‚Äôve learned it‚Äôs sub won‚Äôt happy house every lockdown skeptic turned Waco everyone who‚Äôs restaurant past 5 months personally executed president himself.  depends doctors ask. SEC's medical advisory fine it. Pac 12 Big 10 citing long term health issues. Biggest PROBLEM IM STILL MAKING SHIT-TON MONEY, FUCK GUYS! government Ah, flights must cheap AF I'm seeing Bronx hoodbooger behavior tied American Airlines. Right outfit. CDC guidelines pretty much bare minimum could get away recommending. ""shithole country"" trump would call it. Ok yeah guidelines shit: autistic friend also autistic child. believes vaccine caused childs autism....even though autistic. refuses believe autistic, even though entire family knows is. also refuse allow 3 children get covid vaccination. absolutely way get him. 

This sort thing actually super uncommon. People like going keep virus circulating years. scary think future holds.  Old farts need resign can't handle job more!!! Poston, secretary Faith Baptist Church, said pastor, J. Barry Goodman, unavailable comment confirmed least 90 congregants tested positive COVID-19 beginning July.

Would like that. reading thought smelled something strange. smell **coward.**

Pastor J. Barry Goodman wouldn‚Äôt even face music. **lead** congregation service, collecting sweet sweet tithings, send secretary blowback. Thank making clear worth time even try talk to. situations make want start crying think them, think lot. wrong. Umadbro? No. hate fucking subreddit armchair scientists (some real too, imagine, none working anywhere near important science COVID 19). keep rehashing shit always gazillion reasons science everywhere else done incorrectly inconclusively. 

The aerosol scientist Linsey Marr reddit AMA last week one questions actually called egotistical, ""perfect enemy good"", conclusions suck cause CDC says, way things turned right, along colleagues, spread virus almost exclusively aerosols droplet transmission. 

She addressed every single thing see brought (like ""then contagious measles!? Huh?! Sources please?!), grace, humility, receipts.

It seems though 99% loons sub promptly forgotten all. study still concludes: ""Although viruses identified may noninfectious, health care workers aware SARS coronavirus contaminate environmental surfaces hospital, *fomites considered possible mode transmission SARS.""* let people gaslight situation. Listen doctors scientists YouTube TV news. really thoughtful make masks, really good kid even acknowledge it. Oh do. rambling muh freedoms shit spewed over. fail make point run back something like that. pathetic.

My sons family mothers side Weiss. Meeting grandfather doctor period special thing. fucking act like special family went get apply COVID pandemic.

Edit: confuse message something else. forced dig trenches Nazis among things. many countries used HQC treatment covid-19. Many countries trials studies therapeutic use HQC those, all, stopped ended conclusion HQC efficient efficacy enough treat covid-19. would relevant except fact peaked July 17th testing start decline 27th. 

If saying true would expect see peak days decrease tests account test result lag time.

There's enough real data stress importance this. make fake narratives. mean.... cases per million better statistic represent infected state is? Well technically it‚Äôs not. run deficits everyday, month, quarter, year. technically, anything ‚Äúnormal‚Äù spending financed people buying US debt. european, got ask, plan US, everyone get Covid19, make away ""herd immunity"" concept and/or wait vaccine come ASAP?

Also, people mild course virus bodies make antibodies response virus There's much statistic though. LA fucking MASSIVE. county encompasses 4,753 square miles 10 million residents. really depends community in, too. example, valley lot anti maskers places like Echo Park strong pro mask community. stated article, outdoor dining mostly fine seen significant outbreaks stem outdoors contact. Indoor dining indoor bars biggest contributors. I'm curious area drove people wearing masks? struggles spread food can‚Äôt multiply food What's r 1? illegal, undocumented. Canada getting lot undocumented pple future global south, including US. US whole less testing, increased last month, stopped increasing stayed peak?

Kind misleading chart. least show significant decreases texas/arizona/florida Yes, still many people brackets below. easy blame wealthy people ignorance people easily mislead hate poor people that's real problem. get better yet everyone fakes outrage imaginary &amp; unspecified vulnerable person catch die. wrong every point far. can't claim ""winning"" 2021 there's vaccine.

My friend baby lives three blocks house seen since January. halfway maternity leave shut March. resign let orhers morals take over. reliable site shows total deaths, due coronavirus, month US? course did. make US taxpayers pay wall

Wait... One senator's voice mailbox full... joke. Sucks punchline. Companies making tests getting super rich!  Good thing driven politics. /s Taxation without representation cool headed guy though. I‚Äôd put guy charge damn near anything. would lost shit long ago shoes. lying. fact idea talking about. overwrought liberal teenagers excoriate anti-vax Karens listen Facebook instead doctors--now turn shut listen experts comes politics.   can't get job that's despite everything find one asked last position.

I'd love understand supposed work, actually living sort dystopia like what's shown hunger games story elite whatever hell want 90% expected obey fear hellish repercussions? juxtaposition Big 12, Southeastern Atlantic Coast Conference leaders explaining forging ahead plans play football fall speaking one pandemic‚Äôs deadliest days United States since May much Dr. Carlos del Rio, executive associate dean Emory University School mean, feel like Titanic,‚Äù del Rio said Thursday, day conferences said would abandon playing football sports fall, Big Ten Pac-12 done earlier week. ‚ÄúWe hit iceberg we‚Äôre trying make decisions time band plea college administrators ‚Äî political leaders citizens ‚Äî take coronavirus seriously carry considerable weight, considering del Rio serves coronavirus adviser N.C.A.A. spoke, joined Infectious Diseases Society America webinar Brian Hainline, N.C.A.A.‚Äôs chief medical officer, along another Emory infectious disease specialist, Dr. Colleen del Rio‚Äôs caustic analogy also underlined ineffectual N.C.A.A., moved decisively cancel basketball tournaments spring sports March, directing schools whether go forward fall sports. phase 3 trials estimate efficacy. vaccine suit armor -- people still get sick even though vaccinated various diseases. balance vaccines, strong/effective ones likely also stronger side effects. example this, whooping cough (pertussis) vaccine, used given ""cellular"" type stronger, recent years developed ""acellular"" type yields fewer antibodies. acellular type also wears faster. first rollout covid-19 vaccines probably aiming like stronger type first (my guess, actually know). going fucking cycle federal mask mandate I'm absolutely homeschooling year. people speed? people wear seatbelt? people wear helmet motorcycle? people use dangerous drugs poison bodies kill them? people mistreat loved ones treat hatefully?

The answer friend blowing wind quote Dylan. per capita mean, I've always heard called ""customs"" unless actual land border. Maybe that's American thing. absolutely false. number scientific articles unequivocally stating mutates much slowly influenza. Here's one many mutations seen effective spreading, thus increasing probability mutation. Tell much harder breath ventilator dying alone hospital. know. Still understand Trump anti-abortion candidate. know holds true northeast got hit hard waned people went outside, reverse happen fall comes around, think it‚Äôs bit premature label anyone moronic response. 

In end, northeast getting hit hard early skewed numbers could also leave highest numbers said done due virus reversing course going back wreak havoc north. 

(I live Philadelphia I‚Äôm defending south all) seems like site different rules. skew data cases, stats driven cases, meaningless  feel really bad working poor single parents desperately want keep kids home safe, can't. would feel like told kids matter. going way areas. silent majority north wanted things go back normal. didn‚Äôt want continue fighting black rights  [archive link anyone trouble accessing article ](http://archive.is/4mAJE) Mine wore cloth mask face shield. kind surgical mask, can't remember since months Oh, gotcha. got data back position then. Would mind sharing? lock would truly work would total one. works long people go out, even essential workers. 

So yes theory lock best idea. practice doesnt work. Eventually people go out. Look Argentina.  strict lockdowns world happening today? Chaos. eventually people break, cant stay forever. 

Another example, India. social distancing slums, poor hygiene, younger populations.  deaths minimal clear serology studies massively counted virus well.

Our largest outbreaks prisons nursing homes.  Two populations already lock nature.

The lock downs would slow spread short time. south. eventually virus spreads.

And yes believe reaching herd immunity level. Either estimates population needed curve spread high massively underestimated cases. Probably little both. 

Just think it. everyone suddenly following ""the rules"" nature taking course? thought Lysol killed instantly, spray anyways? difference education make. like school education theatre, recent issues shown school especially lower public school form mass child care, least thats right side views it. country absolute joke even pandemic. Covid really showed greedy, self centered, incompetent called ‚Äúleaders‚Äù are.

America worst country world imho.  Well, I‚Äôm fucked. I‚Äôm super fucked.  ignorance forced someone smarter office. Vehicle counts nine locations Sturgis area show numbers 6% 287,709 last year 270,488 year.

Yow - going COVID grand finale year.  agree., there‚Äôs much don‚Äôt see hear political Congress etc. we‚Äôre lied daily basis! unfortunately seem trapped homes kids allowed go school told basically fear going outside breathe fresh air.

The author forgot include ""with pay"".

WTF.  FINALLY. Thank America stepping up. support. Take power back goodness sakes, get Bitcoin. Americans? should‚Äôve happen long ago won‚Äôt happen either. Devils advocate here. Insurance companies allowed that. house burned without insurance it, can't buy make company pay existing damages. assholes Kentucky probably going re-elect turkey called break...

However, latest poll shows 5 point lead challenger Amy McGrath. still longshot, knows? crazy year going crazy election. I'm hoping best. flu season, selfish see families? go work? send kids school?

There's people refuse get flu shot, go work coughing like crazy, go ""omg flu, whatever"".

Yes, people selfish assholes. even then, again, individuals decide. society set rules variety behaviors. People go beyond, bars, other's lives line.

But like said, apple apple. virus that's around forever well understood, vaccine even (awful barely effective, still) antivirals available\*\*. something entire world trying get control paid incredible cost get (and barely falling apart so). Individuals thinking they're making efforts go waste miss inlaws whatever pretty damn low.

\*\* Hell, I've live large cities whole life, use exclusively public transportation, I've never flu entire life. Depending estimation model look at, COVID amount cases even though shut everything down.

EDIT: clear, mean within confine rules set. rules bad people following them, well, that's leadership fault. they're still selfish pricks, that's it. Regardless party affiliation going right unprecedented, thousands dead, millions without work, millions soon evicted. president worth damn would make national address demanding congress return bill passed helps American people. 

What fucking joke. Customers fear getting covid technicians refuse wear masks, too.  couple weeks ago, four different techs (Comcast contractors) came onto property, three different days. process, talked neighbors.  one contractors wore mask, all. mask bandana, around neck time.  Exactly. comes daughter I'm afraid she'll deal aftermath. likely survive, knows long term effects pop while? We're seeing among adults already. hope there'll known soon. grandmother Silent generation, she‚Äôs board social distancing, masks etc. 

She lost father Asian flu (which actually Hong Kong flu don‚Äôt want correct 90 year old woman still pained another pandemic taking beloved father half century ago) made appointment @ UNC Campus health get tested COVID-19. arrived 10 min appointment &amp; told stand line goes door. 20 minutes. girl behind line said 2 friends entire suite tested positive. Early read one could bake mask conventional oven 160Àö 30 minutes. correct? We've 170Àö (that's low electric oven go), usually add another 5 minutes. logic argument isn‚Äôt. fact you‚Äôre arguing states ‚Äúwith worst policies governments‚Äù shows you‚Äôre detached reality what‚Äôs actually happening America.

What‚Äôs good Californians may good people Wyoming. senate allows everyone equal representation end day, republican democratic policies looking American people know it‚Äôs called dude. expressing generic difference. sounds like think way educated this, I‚Äôll let go somewhat offensive think much smarter rest us. Now, classical trained, college educated, working field virologist, stand corrected. However read well. millions people reddit read. It‚Äôs getting downvoted. 

However, People aren‚Äôt getting worked aids malaria aren‚Äôt community passed people way flu covid are. Malaria treatable first world country. choose protected monogamous sex. TB poor example. low transmission rate treatable. don‚Äôt even inoculate anymore. majority deaths industrialized counties. unfortunate, true. I'm going keep teaching civics you. houses power. fact. wrong, I'm done discussing you.  would love extra $ hazard pay. point though, things going get really bad way things heading, especially way US handling things.

Bringing child world point, certainty humanity get shit together, could devastating. kid might deal largest displacement event entire history mankind. Unless shit ton money leave kid, statistically speaking don‚Äôt, it‚Äôs gonna potentially deal joys mass migration, starvation, homelessness, death.

I would never shame someone child, it‚Äôs evolutional need level, existential need arguably. also let people give others reasons them, today‚Äôs world many. There‚Äôs nothing sick realistic. time I‚Äôm sure we‚Äôll need really strong group kids next generation, think handle it, go right ahead. Point remains - island nation incredibly limited reach rest world, completely control comes can't keep COVID bay, suggest US able comical.

And simple 'wear mask' Corn syrup supports American farmers... enough time that, least proper way. act now. people determined see racism everywhere, frankly care even little bit see way. care perceptions. question matters whether actually racist policy not. clearly racist policy since put place time vast majority impacted White backed evidence. 

If anything Maori Pacific Islanders thankful policy two groups risk death serious illness Covid. Oh love god.

These generalizations complete lack knowledge whats happening capitol bad.

Democrats pushing continued stimulus fearing evictions lack ability support due enough jobs.

They passed bill house, works fine, senate pass want steal money cronies. runs senate right now? GOP. mad GOP.
Not politicians general. Get mad people actually responsible.

Mods /r/Coronavirus want sub political.
Newsflash guys, EVERYTHING POLITICAL. Separating politics nigh impossible politics representative persons character. Dumbasses willing believe masks harm help you, every single government world lying pandemic, likely vote support GOP. GOP ones perpetuating shit representatives also wear masks congress session. guys seen televised hearings? Shitstains like Matt Gaetz, Louis Gohmert, rest wearing fucking masks. Trump wear mask. quite clear pandemics political, one party using pandemic wedge issue fearmonger voting populations thinking wearing mask tantamount taking away freedoms. 

These asinine generalized comments need stop getting upvoted. Specifics source materials need upvoted top, best job inform people get votes eyes, vague garbage nothing actually figure problem is.

Edit: Removed lot fucking. btw.

Yeah REAL first world country. probably going manufacture significantly less deadly. probably harm done especially US lots virus outside lab also. Literally seen anyone call this. People work. believes anything anymore? Still can‚Äôt forget masks needed announcement; find whole rest world knew better. Happy cake day also

Every essential work could find essential really are. guys getting shafted imo. guys least get compensated significant amount hazzard pay long exposed forced work Covid. Find much people going freak economy grinds halt can't easily get groceries packages delivered 2 days. probably going light fire asses get back Congress deal it. corona pandemic caused Swedish disaster historical proportions.

And yet, nordic countries overall mortality, higher I‚Äôm sorry negative experiences campus. I, woman, fortunately experience gendered harassment four years there, far remember, time campus participating university programs abroad, opportunity engage lots students faculty members genuinely excited learn world passionate strengthening international ties growing global citizens. Obviously, though, experiences universal, own, grieves hear negative encounters people associated school could mean-spirited. (Not I‚Äôm laboring belief everyone saint.)

I would inclined credit university‚Äôs action pulling study abroad last spring (and action, pursued American universities, far know) move navigate considerable uncertainties surrounding safety, travel, government actions existed point pandemic. later notice regarding cancellation fall abroad programs cites factors uncertainty regarding future spread pandemic, lack ability guarantee testing resources students abroad, travel bans country-specific isolation quarantine requirements. presume also considered ethic endeavoring transmit US‚Äôs poor pandemic response back parts world. Clearly, lot logistical challenges safety, access, ethics, diplomacy play even without raising prospect institutional xenophobia.

(For record, skeptical absolute best students returned campus fall altogether encouraged early indications testing/conditions campus ‚Äî and, critically, off-campus. Everyone ought treating absolute seriousness, much hope aren‚Äôt exception, nevertheless, even handful flippant serious risk. Absolutely critical profit motives, too.)

I agree South Bend many lovely locals! Even US continues relatively deficient public health measures, can't see flu season bad there. Influenza seeded back forth hemispheres, many southern hemisphere countries low influenza season current aggressive public health measures. Also, travel continue low levels.

However, fall could bad US even minimal influenza. churches. mean boomers think hate them, surprised? may think gift generation. Definitely state. Maybe parts Boston, areas actually got super lucky.

Mostly, threat rolling us back people started paying attention again. Large group designations also got restrictive.

MA also started releasing map town town infection rates give people state better idea areas starting spike compared populations put towns notice. We've nervous increases while- spring bad here, people seem started adjusting behavior rises.  gun shops. Good stuff.üëç population deluded. Tough times. Sucky shiz. 

At end day: ""So, ONE thing paid do?""
Them: "" nahhh. need vacation. See weeks""

Where else would shit fly? Literally nowhere. Imagine us medical field treated work like ! depressing read. come from, police saints. rare occasions, may become overly violent. However, rare happens infrequent definitely singular cases systematic problem.
If walk officer, expect help, get help. car accident happens, deescalate situation necessary. 
And wife got foot broken forest, ambulance got stuck somewhere (fire men drag later), police went in, found brought out.

THIS expect police. happens here. 

Things could still better, still work done police monitored certain individuals abuse position. still. protect help, do.


Germany btw. Well sounds quite bad. I‚Äôve enough pandemics lifetime called fluoride 1) that's senate, House. 

2) didn't' anything. 

So no, thing. trying blame out-party justify blaming party power. Shame you. could probably fly Europe pay surgery come back less insurance US. EU citizenship job US cause parents moved here. hate bit Overpaid uncaring disagree House needs bigger, think solves current issues.

Right Senate majority Senate majority leader much power hamstring legislation years time.  House could represent everyone write great bills bipartisan majority leader responsibility even bring vote. desk packed right legislation passed. 2 options.

1. Wait mass deployment (SAFE!) vaccine pray virus decimate population 

2. Shut correctly administration believes science  Lou Williams?   believe people rise government, members military would side people, likely family members ones hurt self serving politicians almost order could given raise arms people would considered unlawful order. Lab experience critical many STEM majors. it, March HEROES passed? Mconnel refused take discussion weeks ago. plenty time work out. general strike never happen. Americans brainwashed understand concept. Nope It‚Äôs members chosen represent parties states. Let‚Äôs repeal 17th amendment change Yep - America gerontocracy

 

Trump Biden 70s, McConnell 70s, Pelosi 80, average Senator old enough collect social security (63), even gotten started Supreme Court... arsenal military kinda changes balance revolution. French, Russians Americans going unmanned drones could wipe revolutionary force without using boots ground. Never trust Glados. General Boycotts would also effective. would also easier, many people, especially MAGA bosses would say word they're doing. 

It could sustained much longer, far damaging companies, owner class. many people striking simply possible. wild Americans understand power shit constantly consume. Trying get capitalists buy shit? like getting trump lie. We're weak, unorganized. 

stop buying everything, spending money. Ok, want Hollywood targeted specifically COVID-19? Clearly point population control considering population area 61,491 people.

Admit already, population control. trick is, positivity reaches 20% stop testing. /s seems lower one pay scale, essential become.  Another good way looking it, east coast west coast similar populations, yet east coast gets 20 senators west coast gets 6. I‚Äôm ‚Äúessential worker‚Äù, I‚Äôve already resigned potentially dealing life altering medical financial events. fair don‚Äôt family, either die become unable work foreseeable directly affect me. honestly think doctors hospitals would refuse help patients need to... think people cruel. know hold elective procedures needed SAVE PPE covid came town. forget scarce (and still many places). 

I also heard lot people going hospitals treatment due fear covid, would also contribute empty rooms. wonder FL list. We've broken daily records deaths many times recent weeks. course peaks valleys like everywhere else, recent broken record 8/11 276. North see indoor activities like indoor eating, etc shut NYC allowed restart Spring. first action taken federal level, stopping flights China, left accused Trump xenophobia racism. 

It political start. Sure. There's nothing Finland can't get Norrland. still understand why.

We're pretty sure due absolute humidity. tracks spread explains pattern temperate tropical regions there's wet dry coronavirus gone anywhere

Or reduced rate spread. seeing massive explosions like March. would mean current measures sufficient winter. really doesn‚Äôt matter me. I‚Äôm deciding future via market availability. 

I need something I‚Äôm actually interested (and strong knowledge base for) versus something, again, convenient me. I‚Äôve already gone road capitalizing opportunity lead happiness hated work dislike American corporate culture. 

I don‚Äôt need get much it, financial resources cover period time along wife earning good living transferability regardless go school ultimately work.

Edit: It‚Äôs worth noting, reason initially didn‚Äôt follow passions first time college. I‚Äôm going make error twice. used way, too. used quietly laugh people getting PhD poetry (my actual cousin one). She‚Äôs making much money, she‚Äôs lot self actualized fulfilled am, ‚Äúold age‚Äù becoming stronger form currency money. Unless get worst worlds, virus asymptomatic deadly. concern. 

If became deadly continued show symptoms large part population, would real problem hands literally figuratively. :) good luck . It‚Äôs tough self employed artist west coast. You‚Äôll probably working day job hate afford rent. SARS2 seems like closed, indoor environments. New York winter real bad Arizona summer everyone stays inside air conditioned buildings ventiliation. virus seem much affected weather, weather affects human behavior. absolutely wash fruit veg soap. fact, recommended wash things like apples soap decades pesticide residue. Exceptions leafy veg berries, wash soap, rinse well. I'd rather stick social distancing wash hands frequently pandemic ended. I'm sceptical vaccine that's developed less year widely tested enough yet. Cos flu winter thing AZ school district asked parents sign COVID waivers sending children back school 2 weeks ago. Terrible. vaccine causes cell production virus alone doesn‚Äôt? haven‚Äôt heard partly canceled gym membership. went cancel, checked temperature looked around, still one wearing masks. packed, one distancing, maybe 1 mask per 25 people. yeah, take temp. save us.

Now schools going open false sense security temp checks door. hey, America never gave fuck students anyway. Look years inaction school shootings. **Schools stay open coronavirus positivity rate hits 25%** People missed time work due childcare issues schools daycares closing absolutely send kids school sick. Many position keep staying home without repercussions employers they're playing russion roulette children others. people want internet pay extra. someone poor people internet means able work home potentially making money never would chance make otherwise. is, ya know, good. That's good then, thank It‚Äôs 100% due lack critical thinking. happens people make decent living without education. think success means they‚Äôre intelligent everything... large portion country is

Thru history typically would intelligent critical thinker make good living we‚Äôve got entire country wealthiest standard living history many haven‚Äôt worked ass feel remotely positive. already don‚Äôt treat food fomite. Influenza less transmissible Covid. Even half people wearing masks I'm guessing number influenza cases drastically lower typical year.

I‚Äôm feeling really tired. don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm special life harder others. reason MH seems weaker?

My husband burned life savings multiple ‚Äúonce lifetime‚Äù events. don‚Äôt feel motivated. want curl ball. feel defeated. 

I feel like turd/crybaby agree article want voice heard guess. Something rubs wrong way... Young people generally support Democrats don‚Äôt understand related US education system, agree education system needs fixed mentioning doesn‚Äôt really make sense. want criticize US criticize healthcare system US isn‚Äôt anything help people struggling financially right Oh thank god then. fit would enough, need way make body antivirus stronger!! highly doubt that. That's pure hysteria. finding biggest drawback total globalization is, something one person's problem, everyone's problem unless cut off.

There international travel unless totally necessary maybe next summer, every country tries bring back feel wrath.

Wow, reasonable logical person are. Influenza going back running don‚Äôt even know bad coronavirus proliferate winter season 

Ummm, disagree general point comment, yes... yes know bad Coronavirus proliferate winter...

It hit northern Italy heart winter, hit NY metropolitan Area hard late winter- early spring well. 

Back thought virus would find hard spread warmer climates/ spring summer months due heat. evidently case. Honestly bit surprised saying this. good vaccine would 75% effective doubtful get higher this. Treatments certainly better then. However still means generally living virus day day basis. 

I fully agree back normal 2021 likely vaccine available end people handle terms masking social distancing. think happen spite expert recommendations keep masking social distancing vaccine silver bullet.

I got tv working delayed period canada due virus.

Fauci said use masks medical people need you. die fuck cares. doctor dies 20 people die.

He phrased nicer, think have, basically you, anonymous person internet saving lives fuck die government makes enough masks another country does.

When happens allowed waste masks keeping self alive.

Fauci said sacrifice government got shit together. lived, nice. access mask, nice.

If wear that's thing. ever question lamb slaughter? 

I always find strong opinion -anything- say year ago someone trying manipulate propaganda worked. strong opinion masks year ago? Yeah, see, disagree ""necessary"" is. Yes, hospitals stressed. happens bad flu seasons well. effects nothing compared keeping hundreds millions people work indeterminate amount time, let alone delaying development children. yeah..I went Mexico lately People like he‚Äôs top expert country (and decades) *he changes stance evidence presented proves wrong*. Trump thing country would far better place right now.  president neanderthal. Ofcourse would say that. Keep living dream right wrong whole world laughs away country stupidity. Yeah, never let division hatred among fellow citizens. difference events today social media - quite opposite ""bringing people together"". See10 days spreading.

Common sense escaped you, cant recognize difference collateral damage whole ideology built destruction entire western civilization bomb must destroyed half brain. people even know climate extinction coming lifetime. Imagine depression levels like people try come grips species' rapid extinction. states states manipulating counts?

I know can't hide increased deaths forever might able while. think hope next administration able distribute vaccine non-clusterfuck way. Immunity long level skepticism, would say America doubts bad medical professionals saying. personally know anyone, anyone, tested positive, live populated area. can‚Äôt imagine rural parts country unlikely know anyone. don‚Äôt doubt virus exists, find hard remember guidelines hasn‚Äôt affected personally (I still them, there‚Äôs cynical part makes seem pointless). I'll argue point useless simply hepa filter childhood room allowed me, allergic dogs, live 2 golden retrievers entire life lol. repeatedly responded me, thinking someone else.

You repeatedly tried play same, stupid, line, like broken record, trying twist words got angry didn‚Äôt work.

Thanks opportunity play ‚Äòdebate stoopid‚Äô today dude. fun counting tax dollars freedumbs today whilst lie tucked warm bed socialist taxpayer funded healthcare scheme sees Australian states total coronavirus case number 0, yet again.

I might go get free flu shot tomorrow. 
Tootaloo!! True.. going bring back. suspect bipartisan support fact Congressperson supported eliminating DHS would immediately smeared opponents making country less safe. Probably words like, ""they support terrorists"", ""they care keeping kids safe"". Idiotic, effective. death reporter 2 day policy, cause death could lag 2 weeks. Sometimes get extreme cases like this. Pay people stay home. Starve virus. Implement contact tracing. Done. people partying going bars without masks republicans? And? yet prove point degree. Real disasters, Spain United Kingdom, likely worse economy well.

Are....are implying Sweden isnt real disaster?

Jesus christ wonder Swedes brainwashed kinda media. Next year's funding. Dr Osterholm also mentioned inevitably kids going back schools universities rate virus, weather keeps people indoors, see explosion cases 

He positive person heard worry voice Folks remember corona began Chinese guy ate bat got cold ant eater. think he's optimistic. America. Even vaccine grants reliable immunity, anti-vaxx movement country guarantee COVID stays issue years. seen they've cultured surfaces, I'm curious that. seen PCR drawbacks that. still question much virus takes infect. know severity illness seems dose related. gives fuck? Seriously.

Everything wrote factually accurate. Prove wrong.

Otherwise, ‚Äòcontribution‚Äô worthless. Give years it'll Life Wartime Correct. kinda is. Capitalism reactionary. pay something, it. usually means preemptive measures. ""pay* PPE need, bother, *pay* use space hospital beds usage right them? Well sometimes shit happens capitalism sometimes reacts. Seven months pandemic still taking official numbers face value? Deaths Mexico known massively undercounted, Mexico City alone 26,300 excess deaths 16 March 19 July versus 8,300 official covid deaths. quite likely actual deaths Mexico close 100,000, maybe even more.

The situation US bad, Mexico way worse. even American. problem, americans get flu, go running emergency room. Canada, suck up, stay bed. stopped cases going skyrocketing recently.

They need shut hotspots, continue social distancing rest works.

I'm jealous level conformity seem anti-mask idiots enough stop this. lot ""nonessential"" appts cancelled (annual checkups example). still went annual OBGyn well checkup get insurance discounts well checkups. However, many insurance plans that. 

Also, dentist stopped bi annual cleanings saw patients needed urgent care.

My husband's primary care doctor started virtual visits. might almost seem pointless. What's amazing media seems surprised surge COVID cases already schools. Like, never public school lives? Schools perfect petri dishes people politicizing pandemic Trump loyal followers First... world talking about? make claims. trying accomplish? 

You missing point entirely think trying prove things true. saying read true lots people are. CNN told us FBI announced people trying take advantage benefits system faking positive tests, need meet check box. sister ICU nurse seen people chart COVID-19 lessen costs patients. prove that? Nope one way other. find articles show cases COVID patients getting screwed money also patients getting entire bill covered. does. not. matter. pointless local blips turned click-bait specifically targeted piss someone like off. **That saying.**

I said reasonable claims (as way desire disprove them, guess?) people right basing shouting on... maybe find coming from... ignoring troll bait. see way. need take away reading completely different news are. ""facts"" ""sources"" support literally whatever anyone wants say. Everyone this. this. biased way around that. importantly, again, MATTER claims true. 

The point that, true false, way entire world claims like (or claims) change overall trends urgency. That's message could spreading. whole city, whole state, could faking positive cases explain 200,000 deaths across country, full ICUs shipping patients remote locations room them... get stuck arguing people small potatoes never see, get anyone else see bigger picture. literally, does. not. matter. becomes WIN completely irrelevant one-on-one standoff!?

-----------------------------------------------------------------

If cannot shrug ""wild consistently unverified claims"" without derailing conversation order hear opponent tell right... guess can't change that. tell one net positive negative could possibly come giving valid source got false positive test purpose? would argue point either way. cares?

But know also left making inconsistent unverified claims well. argument super geniuses brain-dead farmhands, conversation American people. that, guess stay echo-chamber here, please. 

My suggestion, anyone cares:
Try ignoring points think BS unverified claims. even honestly accept keep conversation alive. See even really make difference. focus almost completely SPREAD virus, thing us regular people, outside medical viral professionals actually anything about. think find still make great points. That's CDC doing. go looking reports them. available, they, Fauci, experts actually **telling** people death rate, numbers shock-and-awe headlines... stop spreading germs. virus spreading world. That's message. That's it. 

One example: Suppose ""idiot"" talking claims ""death rate"" 0.1%, 0.01% even makes happy. matter, can't change death rate argue it? Still though, seen 160,000 - 200,000+ additional deaths US alone since March normal average. death rate lower think, SPREAD far HIGHER thought order show kind deaths end death-count matter person, right? actually control SPREAD. need math consult experts cite lines news articles either side stop spread germs. just... spread them.

Then stop. Find even believe 160,000-200,000 numbers continuing. Ask questions like person too. believe 1,500 people US died yesterday normal day? size numbers even concern 7,000 people die US per day normally? people know town/city affected pandemic? go there. Otherwise hit wall anyway talking again. 

""Those numbers deaths disguised COVID-19!"" OK, sure, can't prove wrong you. Let's assume that. 160,000 extra people dying couple months. Enough least surely see surge hospitals places... Shouldwe concerned that?. coronavirus something else know about? think dying? think cities live? 

Masks chips them? Masks make sick stop breating? OK great, way prove wrong, make then? else slow spread thing? things little careful spreading germs? think different germs normal area?

And can't go further. someone refuses see pandemic thinks family safe it... thinks 200,000 additional deaths US 2 million die every year hyped noise... walk away. person going educate ""idiot"", ONE person. need win one. local government steer ship there.

If numbers make people angry... glue them. awesome get easily era. gives us sense scale. need set back make decisions basic logic. That's people work. 

**If someone already care virus, net negative everyone get angry also. far less likely look reality, take real evidence front eyes change position would before**

Just look masks alone. right wing conspiracy nuts stock-piling fucking things years. wear pandemic think chemicals science projects air time. piss yell wear masks idiots friggin' boycott masks! writing wall here. nothing thinking masks work. upset called idiots. That's it. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------

If point talking people coronavirus, regardless side fence live on, guide suggest people action manner helps us fight death-count together, aligned, think could working me, even without meaning to. piss people absolutely makes dig harder. BIG issue US right governments clumsy handling pandemic. firmly believe that. can't anything government outside elections, something communicate. Sometimes figure ""the dumb idiots"" ideas order truly talk them. sorry hard accept even hard do. Contrary might like think, regular-ass people make massive portion country. 

The two us arguing ridiculous. Embarrassing honestly. walk away now. agree virus, wasting energy here. Go talk people disagree ideas like me. Let know goes. That's conversation needs happening. fucking dumb??? Rural areas hospital beds per capita urban areas. Vaccines designed trigger robust immune response contain immune dampening parts viruses. 

The stronger response longer immunity usually lasts. expect might need covid boosters hopefully vaccine last long time. Trump likely get reelected

If right pack babies flee country. Maybe escape time, maybe not. hard find country willing accept refugee americans infested covid. Yeah probably right. would hvae total lockdown 4 weeks going clear up. know France Spain style lockdown US, initiated Biden least, would probably spark civil war. 

There pretty much way get control vaccine comes online. can't believe much totally fucked it. brother really bad fever one day, went away fine. Two days later symptoms (including sense taste) sick two weeks. fever never came back. passed step dad dad, never fever either. 

They‚Äôre better now, that‚Äôs good. quote movie ConAir. getting hazard pay? Lol New York Sweden would beg differ ask autorities country see same. know feel buddy. Let's hope treatments course vaccine trails drastically improve outlook next couple months. light end tunnel still there. assuming January question quickly first vaccine distributed. Yeah that's disillusioned statement colleges last decade. flu deaths year

Well, 'estimated' numbers. used standards attributing deaths flu covid (two symptoms, test needed) bet would 150-200k range. would newsworthy lol. 

So saying covid deaths 60-80k range, shutdowns/lockdowns longer needed? flu season, right? like attitude! ridiculous part response 9/11 repeat. 9/11, anytime plane hijacked, passengers safest thing cooperated hijackers. 9/11 changed passengers never cooperate hijackers. success 9/11 hijackers ensured nobody could try regardless TSA/DHS anything else did.  Interesting Dr Osterholm said expects things get much worse flu thinks mild season

He think inevitably things seem little better coming weeks schools universities start rate virus infections explode Looking date deaths, one unknown date one far back 9th July.

Jesus fucking christ delay. acceptabable first world country. Torille. Literally never told anyone shut up. Wtf talking about?

I suggested someone grew one country, makes wildly inaccurate statements another county read country first making comments.

Also, Reddit. scientific realm. 

Another point - agree points call citations? realize sincerely dumb sounds?

Finally, need citations factually accurate points made either 1) sincerely dumb 2) purposefully idiotic bc everything talked beyond common knowledge grew states. 

Civil war, systemic racism, poor education system disinformation campaigns widely known citations are, again, needed ppl simply dumb purposefully dumb. could stop idiot get flu shot. I'm 31. real sweet spot. years kids ""the world going ok"", could get degrees whatever interested in, still chance save environment. watched 3000 people die live TV 12, economy fall apart right graduated, etc. Speaking literally going year finally got life together multiple moves, career reboots additional education. Things looking promising first time adult life. Then, know, fuck me. don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs religion causing problem. think it‚Äôs politics rest country, church members. 

I firmly believe Jesus would worn mask. evidence Matthew:36-40: 36 ‚ÄúTeacher, greatest commandment Law?‚Äù 37 Jesus replied: ‚Äú ‚ÄòLove Lord God heart soul mind.‚Äô 38 first greatest commandment. 39 second like it: ‚ÄòLove neighbor yourself.‚Äô 40 Law Prophets hang two commandments.‚Äù*

It seems pretty clear everything help/protect others, learning wear mask. know pastor one views way tries help others view way, well. study, please link it? Hopefully Americans afford $3000 price tag takes one dose. country run Americans. one two punch nuts combo. wife worked summer, saving vacation later traveling option. Kids started school last week. Leave link here. dont know happened Lyme vaccine know people really need New Jersey forest rangers. many people tested released? sure good comparison. I'm gardening, working livestock handling mail terrorist sent lol. amount anthrax found naturally soil low one going get sick it. real risk anthrax gardening use contaminated bonemeal fertilizer breathe in. course, even rare. know world scary gonna okay! mistook education system true learning knowledge.

You tricked - focused learning betterment rather grades would come positive mindset towards learning. Watch mess trigger ADE problem non trivial percent population turn everyone vaccines... üôÑ know Democrats started kkk, created planned parenthood depopulate black population, Started Antifa, Set Internment camps? 2020 America, expect people politicize something? naive you, Dr. Fauci. Republicans hear think ban outdoor instruction ‚Äúsave economy‚Äù. 1918 people figured masks worked praying schooling outside better mugshot like photo

AKA literal mugshot comfortable mass death. broken. Thank üôè ?? necessarily disagree statement fact virus likely arrived earlier did. numbers small likely caught noise flu cold season. Well, use antibacterial soap strong detergent.

I guess means comment applies dr.bonners like soap guess people don't.

u/snail-overlord linked  still seen documentation infection surface contamination.

The vast majority cases come airborne droplets.

In theory could certainly happen. reality what's relevant. Thank that.. don‚Äôt need make stuff make look even worse.

The fact almost makes seem like ain't really *that* bad begin with. Could improved? Yes. That‚Äôs insult. Neanderthals. sure, declaring victory whatsoever lie puppy pandemic hits good. Yup. absolutely nothing. We‚Äôve implemented since start spread US haven‚Äôt found single instance staff positive denied entry fever. we‚Äôve 20-30 positive staff. Fever isn‚Äôt even reliable symptom 110 patients ive seen. America NOBODY shit. Sanitizing business stopping major spreading paths. Walmart Publix, Winn Dixie area dont inforse masks Publix stopped sanitizing carts. Literally exact experience, except deporting. lot deaths Spanish flu likely secondary infections. didn‚Äôt antibiotics back then.

Edit: that‚Äôs meant take anything away either Covid Spanish flu. terrible. Spanish flu infected 500 million people killed nearly 50 million. 

Without lockdowns global effort, covid would unbelievable amount deaths already. April 9, investigators also learned A0, B1.1‚Äôs neighbor, returned March 19 United States, COVID-19 cases detected. Investigators performed SARS-CoV-2 serum antibody tests A0 April 10 11. SARS-CoV-2 serum IgM negative IgG positive, indicating A0 previously infected SARS-CoV-2 Therefore, believe A0 asymptomatic carrier B1.1 infected contact surfaces elevator building lived residents A0‚Äôs building tested negative SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acids serum antibodies. 

It could argued difference suspected proven, case suspected fomite. Try telling Muslims living America 9/11 damaging industry

Sure, denying cruise lines caught pants violating pollution laws (Carnival I'm looking you). However remember passenger ship numbers almost insignificant massive amount ageing cargo tanker ships floating around seas. Lol. Biden isnt pardoning trump. said, hes fine holding trump accountable investigating him. Blaming protestors nothing else 100 pct politicizing it.

I agree. blaming protesters **as well as** everything else. politicizing right now.

I pointing lack criticism BLM protests, compared activities. need criticize **all** activities spread covid, using **same** language, **same** focus. Way less travel one. Restaurants really thing. Spitting became illegal public... I'm responded to, kinda similar realization. I've thought back head past couple years even though made great life many would envious of, think great fit me.

So pandemic permitting, thru hiking Appalachian Trail next year quitting job start building new career teaching. Investigation completed banned early March. longer option student, allow conversation. That's emails say all.
The question asking model herd immunity effects mathematically.
It obvious everyone half brain actually lives Sweden steady decline deaths hospitalizations since april despite people barely taking social distancing seriously explained immunity. virus could infect people again, would see exponentially rising numbers time. Since new virus one really knows, things called cells help.

From article

 ""The situation seem bad many fear thanks powerful immune system composed cells blood bind kill infected cells ‚Äî aid B cells produce antibodies ‚Äî based memory past infections.

‚ÄúT cells carry immunologic memory reintroduction virus could stimulate memory response leading rapid production antibodies,‚Äù Bloom said"" true. If, god forbid, CDC correct predictions life *could* like colder weather 'regular' flu season arrive, could dark December ways want even think about.  You‚Äôve got lot going wrong comment. Shame they'll vulnerable it, also adding nothing value society. Crime. ‚ÄúI see point living can‚Äôt beautiful.‚Äù anyone questions it, call fake news!

They Pavlov'd conservative base well Thanks. It‚Äôs looking like need miracle. Lol windows open enough force. came close moving Florida eight years ago job. Even flew checked out. Another job came open Vermont (for less money) decided move instead. One best decisions I‚Äôve ever made. 

I really hope folks putting plan together deal catastrophe major hurricane bring, doubt are. ton others well problem. Actually TON certain people love blaming protests galavanting around maskless ignore distancing. Dudes comment still political therefore hypocritical. comment extremely short sighted. takes minutes find people calling BLM source nothing else. understand sentiment agree.

I think vast majority people *do* care. We're seeing massive spotlight put don't, unfortunately minority deplorables directly represented White House. Jacinda give one night health first approach pandemic turns know someone Boise they‚Äôve flying around country, taking pictures socially distancing. imagine people within state. Okay enjoy staying house 2022 mention environmental impacts bunker fuel, marine life kill, poor waste disposal practices cruise industry. viruses hit large cities run certain party. Rural America safe. /s I'm interested satisfying stupid people. that‚Äôs many people fucking stupid one side works split us denying science fact. use things like wearing mask saying ""Happy Holidays"" political attack them. shit stop. I‚Äôm same, rarely get fevers. know something wrong. Yes what‚Äôs happening. Deaths follow cases two weeks America built slavery genocide, never soul. Another Georgian here. area took seriously months (isolation, masks) hit mid July started wane. think folks thought risk small businesses shuttering outweighed perceived reduced threat infection. 

Also, know Trump‚Äòs idiot half like he‚Äôs ""their"" idiot it‚Äôs similar Kemp. wouldn‚Äôt shocked see Biden take presidency Kemp see seat severely threatened.  Norsemen Season 3 (or Season 0) Jarl Varg. Netflix find amusing, sort humor. Trump actually wanted shut air travel sooner. Nancy Pelosi large gathering Chinatown said Trump racist usual insisted reason shut air travel. read vaccine likely multi-dose I'd much happier disagreement literally infectious. I'd lying said thought ending things lately...

I think I'm really depressed. kind like if. Like, ""what gone? would happen? Would world/america eventually get control, doomed?""

Kinda like phenomenon standing front large drop think ""what jumped."" Fauci honest along. know inconvenient stop imagining herd immunity even vaccine going work. We‚Äôve made permanent lifestyle changes last 6 months had, we‚Äôd back normal. :::not helping::: People said kids shot school fake get antibody test? forgot reopening in-person classrooms. help government covers everything covering everything decades good fuck everytime looks like they're hiding shit. need worry cover ups/conspiracies government that's charge cause they're big bunch fuck ups Yeah easy since constitutional right able move freely within country.

What local level ""health department thing"" tricky longer periods

Most people Sweden vote government... Government keeps pretending good assure people skeptical time people ok distancing lockdowns trying claim everyone except Sweden lying deaths everyone else fatality rates equivalent Sweden.

Utter delusional nonsense.  2nd amendment stand tyranny NRA types? actually curious too.

Can really get Coronavirus say food deliveries? stomach acid kill majority viruses.

Basically, many people got Coronavirus WITHOUT face face interaction?  Yah, that‚Äôs true. wish medical professionals (not ortho, hospital, blood donation center) would brush everyday local risks. 

I idea people vacationing right now. haven‚Äôt even considered eating local (DC area) restaurants outdoor seating, way could week vacation spot. guess 0.57% tick stock market valuable Differences policy every country. takes one tourist covid break hard work.

I mean, international travel got us mess anyways realize chicken magically teleport, already seasoned pot boiling oil, right? :-/

You totally fixated cooking part, ignoring storage, handling, preparation, disposal packaging, 99.99%+ interaction chicken. also totally ignoring abysmally high COVID-19 infection rates meat processing plants. like smelling smoke, feeling heat, hearing fire alarm, seeing sprinkler system flood surroundings, saying ""everything fine."" expect new administration ""fix"" anything anytime soon.

What call me? 

You jog on. didn‚Äôt get it. killed 50 million people infected 500 million world wide, 3 waves US, countries less more. killed 640k people US strains alive spreading today. basically got killing people heard immunity want give answer question.. Yeah, super awesome black places like Boston New York City back then. Totally accepting places live longer suffer racism... sure entirely correct there. Might want Google International Maritime Organisation SOLAS.

Last ship spoke one mostly Philippine Indian crew said could work onboard years basically retire decent size farm back home. That‚Äôs concerning! good studies/datasets evaluating mortality rate beyond certain time period (say, around early May June)? I've seen [this mortality uses data since data recorded, although numbers terrifying many come time peak pandemic where, country least, could gain access tests deathly ill, driving mortality rate shown data.  opening businesses schools protections along patrons students _know_ follow rules ludicrous.

How businesses survive diminished capacity?

I agree poster below. Shut minus essentials two weeks, starve it. Pay businesses stay closed / pay employees.  Limit international travel vaccine. I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs ***talk*** would surprised three chose shut-downs things (bars, say) and/or curfews, etc., certain specific areas spike occurring, whole country. warned already happened. Horse left, closing barn doors now. way could claim happen covid either dumb understand kids germ factories 0 hygiene skills general plan doomed start, investments, career, whatever personal gain garner kids school pandemic depends understanding that. Eh I‚Äôm sure sports problem. think extracurricular activities/sports create well rounded individual important have. went high-school Midwest placed heavy emphasis sports, also one highest ranked USA. People playing sports extracurricular activities maintain certain GPA continue enrolled them. actually encourage students stay school drop out.

I think blame falls media. (Both left right biased media) always blames opposite political side problems within country. paint narrative benefits them, even though cases misinformation spread. two party system severely divides United States doesn‚Äôt give people ability think caused us mess now. simple asking, last time ever, heard American refer complete stranger ""countryman"". Certainly victory, definitely grades losing.  replace ""protesters"" sentence ""retards"" might closer truth. takes make sense, pandemics life still went back normal.

I find hard believe won‚Äôt mix vaccines treatments eventually make something average person doesn‚Äôt think day day lives. Insurance companies getting record profits. Doctors hospitals struggling staff getting furloughed. IMHO main reason lack strong, consistent leadership evidence based. Instead every state, county, city, business, person must decide themselves. Anarchy way control stop pandemic. People UK covid sub gone back calling isolating vulnerable people letting covid rip rest population beside ""its mostly safe young people."" madness. I'm sure suits government fine. also think education system structured. Even college grades thing system makes students care especially going graduate school entering competitive field. think becomes important people even bother retraining information get grade. forgiving system emphasis students actually understanding material know. 

Also allowing students bypass gen eds. try spin however want know field want go can't force learn remember information irrelevant future profession. basically forcing students attend class benefit really makes lose interest. wasting time could focus content actually need desire learn. purpose making well rounded individuals... matter? literally look well rounded information later life. class teaches get reliable information critically think reflect would important. store storage, retail shop. might dumb question, mean longer immune? Yesterday's deaths equaled half 9/11 US

And people act like can't quarantine 4 people done it. time find first cases they've already infected others. 29 people. That's restrictions brought back, get ahead virus gets control. Modern day politics thrive turning people eachother Yeah probably waited convenient time fight rights brothes sisters like maybe sometime election? lived NYC 9/11 people always wanted talk united people country. think everyone united racism arabs. think that's necessarily true, still better happening countries. 1789. year France came known Reign Terror. terrible. people France starving Louis 16 Court practically eating gold. Read it. 1/3 population still completely deluded

[Yyyyyep, I'm told blame House Reps passing Like new FBI building Trump wanted? much anyone else Incline home popular beaches ceo said no. what? never got first stimulus. pay taxes young adult, go college. ""essential worker"" nonsense makes think polite saying ""sacrificial worker."" 

Maybe I'll get check upcoming one.. Ima going go work gonna make laws get rid Could collectively vote opposition office entirely? Would make difference literally everyone could lose job does?  wonder then, sake argument, legislative branch would look like Senate abolished. wonder lot duties delegated Senate House, example conviction impeachment President. Would power vested House, would go states themselves, perhaps legislatures? could asked Senates exclusive duties. Says whom?? Buddy could argue day got better things do. teach Chem Hillsborough believe me, made right choice. 0 additional social distancing taking place kids arent going comply mask mandate first chance get. going mess. absolutely reason regular high school kids f2f. Everything online. I'm Berlin big illegal raves every weekend 1000s crowded young people Europe dancing without masks.

Somehow outbreaks. voted stones right? Don‚Äôt worry trickle us...eventually /s best place angry protesters show vent frustrations, would Republican campaign functions, especially Senators running reelection. karens problem. nothing happen, general strike, Congress continue fuck everyone over. folks old news politicos done life .. least starting reagan trickle bullshit ... u ..why take long cry outrage ?

but another temporary tantrum go away soon .. 

come prove wrong please .... time Senate return month long vacation. takes completely different type person influential like kids see Instagram. creators. Instagram handle Reddit.

Hang there, work hard, stay safe keep nice. That‚Äôs human.

Edit: stopped using Etsy nobody buying anything cost money. reason pay two things opinion. end day, boils marketing yourself. Unless got friend help that, not. Strike strike strike. work since spring me, it‚Äôs no-brainer. prepared life real world NYC nursing homes kinda shoved bodies little closets decompose since staff infected/didn't come detect heart attacks. unlikely made EMS system all.

Many news articles April May here's example nice calls poor areas young essential workers (young 30-50) Queens Bronx.

It gets bad quickly. think lockdown anxiety issue, wait get deal mass graves ditch. Don‚Äôt assume someone retains high office decades uneducated. malice. national leadership, stunning. anyone get ""educated"" control media read, unless insider yourself?? one supposed know truth everything research want learn? US take vaccine get rid it. /s literally

You keep using word.

Oulu bar changes name Covid-19

The owner says name change divided opinion among customers.

A bar Finland's northwest coastal city Oulu changed name Covid-19, evoking positive negative reactions patrons locals alike.

The bar‚Äôs owner Phithat Narongphan told Oulu-based newspaper Kaleva name premises, previously called Eighty Eight Bar, changed business became limited company.

Options 'Corona 88' 'Hotbar 96' considered, Narongphan said, eventually decided rename bar 'Covid-19', approved Finnish Patent Registration Office three weeks ago.

""This meant attract attention. reflects fight virus, bad time,"" Narongphan told Kaleva. ""Certainly Covid-19 lives many years come.""

Narongphan said new name received positive, mostly negative, feedback.

""The name name,"" Narongphan said. ""Probably 90 percent don‚Äôt like it, do.""

The recently emerged SARS-CoV-2 virus currently causing global pandemic cases continue rise. majority infected individuals experience mildly symptomatic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), unknown whether induce persistent immune memory might contribute herd immunity. Thus, performed longitudinal assessment individuals recovered mildly symptomatic COVID-19 determine develop sustain immunological memory virus. found recovered individuals developed SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG antibody neutralizing plasma, well virus-specific memory B cells persisted, cases increased numerically three months following symptom onset. Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2-specific memory lymphocytes exhibited characteristics associated potent antiviral immunity: memory cells secreted IFN-Œ≥ expanded upon antigen re-encounter, memory B cells expressed receptors capable neutralizing virus expressed antibodies. findings demonstrate **mild COVID-19 elicits memory lymphocytes persist display functional hallmarks associated antiviral protective immunity.** put 'Tussin it, boy.

I might even argue political media undermines good leaders, leaving us constant cycle division. Japan's strategy test, tell. main objective olympics. Mask wearing reasonable populace covered lacking Abe's admin quite time.

Fuck two capitalist hegemonic right-wing parties though.

GlobalResearch.ca LifeSiteNews massive agendas push.  Well thankfully global warming we‚Äôve increasingly mild winters NE. (/s) link sends description, study (study protocol). important information found Short summary is:

* county: Kupferzell, 6,1k population, study 2203 adults
* 7,7% positive antibodies (female 8,7% male 6,7%)
* timeline: 20 May - 9 June acute infections
* 16,8% asymptomatic cases 83,2% least one symptom
* dark cases: study detected 3,9 times infections
* antibodies: 28,2% positive cases detected antibodies (**no conclusion, immunity**) opinion Blacks simply get work dismantling structural racism put positions can't afford good nutrition, live paycheck paycheck, would rather save $2 child needs medicine?

Whoosh We'd able return level normalcy we'd COVID response every industrialized nation world. spreads, chances gets mutate... Obviously majority people aren‚Äôt absolutely idiots think Bill Gates spreading virus get money vaccines mental gymnastics people engage avoid seeing what's clearly front face interesting. could take Russia sentence replace America. parents objecting school?? Maybe understand bc son old enough go school yet was.. send him??? I'd literally tell school fuck off?? choice keep kids safe? mean get since people go work rather 7+ year old safe home instead exposed freaking petri dish. Don‚Äôt worry! magically disappear! Maybe? doesn‚Äôt look good COVID hasn‚Äôt around long enough us actual answer. guess probably think lot actual doctors would agree. could short term immune system overreaction that‚Äôs big deal could mean start chronic disability massively shortened lifespan. ones recovered year. It‚Äôll take 20 start seeing real impact this. read day spread 26 ft cold.... positive test, cares. literally almost 100% chance surviving. Advice fall winter:

If know cook basic level, start learning Yeah. would hurry get h-immunity wouldn‚Äôt chance evolve. eradicate quickly. understand that. think foolish. Well everyone expenses remember. going difficult raise children low income regardless, lot people know that's situation avoid things.

For example made sure go state university paid went refused take student loans. end needing to, would taken time make money. never buy car can't afford outright. eliminates car payments. saved long time put sizeable payment house bought lot equity low payments. Daycare/preschool also optional. worth difference income someone stay home? Maybe one parent work part time instead? many things lower cost living match smaller budget. shit

The current one I'm seeing lot (NY/NJ) overreacted since none hospitals overrun/ overwhelmed like ""*they*"" warned about...

Move on, i'm done you. Look, know facts, daaamn unbearable. Like even met person I'm already tired haha. This. Cytokine Storm. hit healthy people hardest due immune system overreacting. theorized older people least partially protected exposure previous strain many years earlier. people want risk getting virus, CHOICE. Yep. daughter able play another kid person since March, see hear many kids neighborhood playing together like nothing ever happened. hard see. Thats true. Unfortunately, live beautiful 100 year old building owners trying hard success figuring get central air heat building.

My apartment air conditioner, needed isolate GF upstairs one roommate returning school year, best social distancer (though area NY literally case since June), run bunch errands get ready reason get lap dances women natural breasts. Logic opinion - deduced variables (like mathematics).

The fact presented 195,000 Americans died October 1918 (which pretty easy anyone verify raw fact).

In case, op simply stating given fact true, either CDC wrong bloodbath coming. really possible outcome. Depends--I tracking Arizona's cases, numbers might make sense recovering huge spike cases (since deaths lag behind case counts days weeks). could also indicate horrendous lack testing, hinting FAR actual cases (just untested). I‚Äôm worried restaurants going left spring. state Sweden's delay bad. called asked provided source statement fail. 


The onus you, make claim. 


Your claim Sweden's delay unsubstantiated. make stuff thin air. high quality information. ""Ma'am, Wendy's"" Canadian, sounds ridiculous. went school even -40C.

That's really long boat ride doomed :( That‚Äôs erroneous can‚Äôt take known infections percentage multiply get correct percentage. significant number people virus get tested virus I‚Äôm interested answer question, can‚Äôt find many definitive answers outside rare cases. thoughts way couldn‚Äôt happen time one person compete somehow (e.g. one limits others resources prevents surviving host).

I‚Äôd love someone knowledgeable researched 2 minute Google search made chime in. God, beautiful. 


If stuck soul-crushing American poverty might go visit one day black ass first line possible lol. I‚Äôm tired pandemic I‚Äôm willing elbow grandmas way get vaccine first. 

Ok I‚Äôm kidding elbowing grandmas part. It‚Äôs disheartening many people would refuse life saving vaccine. Agreed.

This pure nightmare. read thought meaning self isolate 3 months. one thing pretty much bank isn't, general, large reduction people heart attacks.

It's going percentage excess deaths. Yeah, Alyssa Milano talking this. Could air inside school, air inside bar/restaurant air inside office. Multiple cases tied camous party. campus students buy groceries, liquor stores, take bus. camlus big, packed parties lots alcohol are.

By way, know Brawndo's got electrolytes? plants crave.  seems common sense Gotta keep fanning flames fear keeping people scared complacent. think don‚Äôt enough sample size know right now. 6 months ago literally handful infections. Underrated comment IMO :) say make difference. won‚Äôt. US deeply broken, there‚Äôs headline yet another stupid Trump quote anything else fix it. There‚Äôs literally large portion population dumb can‚Äôt fix that. There‚Äôs way end well. Watch fast things change longer making elite rich. Persistent ball pains according Chinese research reports plan publicly changed month ago. announced second wave, happen, infected would removed state run quarantine. bad luck first family infected Pacific Islanders thus close contacts. science education. really cultural change view knowledge intellectuals. Right now, we're culture ""my ignorance good expertise"". That's scientific illiteracy. $3 trillion went WALL STREET

That's true. bunch went OT likes regular, unemployed Americans. dense fucking idiot.

Well, maybe done here. wow. Sorry care normal people country whole. Jeeze, man. Well shit fewer 50M-100M die. Winning. disillusioned healthcare professionals treating this.

I visit office every 1-2 weeks allergy shots. (I cluster shots almost maintenance dose [monthly] COVID threw nice wrench things). stopped months, appointments removed allergist wearing face shield surgical mask wishing N95.

Today I'm wearing N95 + multiple layer cotton mask top, doctor wearing mask seeing patients walking among office corridors, receiptionists routinely masks hanging one neck. vastly limiting appointments/number people office still.

My dentists seem wearing surgical masks N95, wear face shields...

Meanwhile local urgent care clinic saying severely ill COVID symptoms go home 48 hours good. Basically, offer testing COVID, seriously ill [go hospital ill] go home please get tested :^)

We've come full circle. Apathetic many areas, tests rationed policy (+ delayed) point useless contain it. Neither corona major economic recession showing signs dissipating. going do? Keep begging reforms system state killing you?

There never justice long violent system enforcing inequality vanishes earth. idk, year year people say, it‚Äôs republicans! dems equally blame. nearly rotted? don‚Äôt think so. however, old adage ‚Äúit takes two tango‚Äù true ever. year year avert gaze corruption serve interests. may dysfunctional outside, get business usual same. need highly skeptical claim people, time time prove, people come agenda.

I verify least first hand experience...

Fewer people tested fewer places tearing asymptomatic 10-11 year olds would able stay home.

Well, stay home alone not. policy would home. parents decide technology troubleshooting something goes wrong?

I guess kids need learn too. got first computer (before age 10) school barely computer lab parents certainly tech English isn‚Äôt first language?

Then guess taking online classes ESL handle at-risk kids?

Bill gates stumbled upon pretty good idea, like entrepeneurs. evil genius like seem think. ‚ÄúIt is.‚Äù anyone's wondering, 30k.. I'm sure senate works way ancient Greeks intended worded vague way sounds like things go back normal I.e socialising others, wear masks etc. This! It‚Äôs politically trendy right blame Trump average American far blame. People wearing masks, social distancing large social gatherings main culprits can‚Äôt get handle this. 1918 virus elicited severe cytokine storm robust immune systems, killed people within hours first symptoms. many anecdotes healthy, vigorous people leaving home feeling well morning dropping dead noon. Congrats MA! It‚Äôs 6 months, early infections area covid longer prevalent. year know anything reinfection possibilities. Patriot: Looks like crazy asshole back

Dooomer: think follow rules respect virus economy recover lot faster

Patriot: Look stupid idiot would need lockdown? 3 months immunity (or however long lasts) bodily equivalent lockdown. which, population's collective immunity begins fade, cases occasionally pop up, easy identify, isolate, contact trace persons risk exposure. 110000 cases New York State. Officially. SMH, suicidal thoughts always surging  left almost speechless, level apathy display US government apalling. final straw? else government need people stand tyranny oppression? Agreed. isn‚Äôt part overall process get market? chain strongest it‚Äôs weakest link mean. Unlikely happen. Although Senate cannot gerrymandered like Congress can, still great many voters think ""well, yeah, Senate sucks, Senator bad..."" comment voted implies restrictions never disappear doomed socially distancing introverts.

There difference that, hoping makes working home viable move many etc. going """"vacation"""". country accepting Americans right lol.

More like staycations. $3 trillion went WALL STREET dense fucking idiot.

It matter performative gestures pass House pass law pass goddamn thing. media ran Trump constantly. media chooses angle candidate won‚Äôt let up. Wee snaw Ridiculous NZ quarantining literally every single person arriving NZ 2 weeks govt facilities guarded police military. large majority arrivals White.

The previous regime leaving testing positive homes self-isolate many people arrived back NZ late March early April simply facilities quarantine separately whole country level 4 lockdown month, could trust spread further. 

We can't afford another Level 4 Lockdown now, option. first family exposed happened Pacific Islanders. plan always remove infected quarantine facilities second wave. plan announced month ago. someone FB friends list wrote thought good example blind ignorance:

Oh, mandate order attend school, travel foreign countries, etc.? already growing number vaccine researchers refusing proven, tested, well-known vaccines administered decades! really believe majority people flock get fast-tracked vaccine, whose long-term side effects overall efficacy rates anyone's best guess? long going cancel?

When decide quality life outweighs risk? 

We understand virus deadly SOME, shellfish, peanut butter, bee stings. take risks every day without second thought. 

We know driving car dangerous, leave parked garage months end. know dangers smoking, drinking, eating fried foods, it, none-the-less. speed highways, idiots still buckle seatbelts, take medications ‚Äúas directed,‚Äù good number individuals think twice unprotected sex. 

Is hugging Grandma really dangerous rush hour freeway? going bar friends risky four day old gas station sushi? operating chainsaw? lawn mower?

When quickly lose free will? 

I want waiver says, ""I understand risks, choose life hugs, smiles, college athletics, state fair, concerts, school dances."" 

I understand minuscule possibility could die but, probable, end feeling like junk days. 

I understand could possibly pass virus onto someone else, pass virus onto someone else time end time. possibility dying ALWAYS there... death happens days numbered. 

Are busy living busy dying?

It‚Äôs hard tell days.‚Äù Mass rapid testing needed, week everyone frequent contacts. Identify isolate infected become spreaders. matter atmosphere us

If someone going computer science need realize might get work ‚Äúatmosphere‚Äù like. lot places going stay WFH model. 

Sounds like zoomers want cuddled. ""Up to"" accurate. ""at least."" debunked dead lung cells reason retested positive. Also, Fauci said likely immune time say COULD finite anything else says would misinformation don‚Äôt data. Also, reports last month show immunity might longer lasting think T-Cell memory. 

Remember, we‚Äôd seeing reinfections THOUSANDS. one two cases Maybe set fund people money bank donate support living paycheck paycheck. call sort thing ""organizing"" reason.

 People really evacuate Cat 4-5 (maybe 3) going hit them...if hurricane large, slow moving location would subject sustained 100+ mph winds huge amounts surge/flood many hours perhaps whole day passes directly you...look aftermath hurricanes past - Andrew, Katrina, etc....you want anywhere near path (which usually get solidified 3-4 days ahead best) Yes, could increase chances bad immune systems dying well. We'll check back end year wether speculation proves correct though. Much like countries creating ""travel bubbles"", people start creating ""social bubbles"".

An entire year w/o socializing person doable mental health always priority alongside physical health.

Create social bubble friends know taking precautions thus created environment socialize without worry anything. agree, suggesting pipe dream. It'd great entire world stayed inside next 2 months waited current covid cases, that's impossible. Even vast majority global population manage that, even 1 case re-opening could cause another outbreak current scale.

We're waiting vaccine, that's ways off. meantime, need learn live covid taking good safety measures. would shame McConnell's vacation interrupted protests. believe 7 cases traced campus party.

His shoes covered though? like trolling u fools. need get deep always ""18 months"", listened epidemiologists March. Trump sycophants thought going summer. Literally chopped heads... Get antibody test see you‚Äôve it. may still come contact. Including fact Trump trying fuck elections destroying USPS. Except delays nothing efficacy drugs. hard organize robust trial, especially mostly working people feel sick (and may inclined take consider risk). dunno, *did* French 1789? well 1792. people lose crap don't.

Source: Janitor  People refuse services Senate members, including medical services, pass something.  specific links? Except possible vaccines may 50% effective, almost certainly going 80%. large number anti-vaxxers. Bottom line, never going away, best hope becomes something akin seasonal flu terms danger. rely treatments already ill patients well maintaining sufficient medical resources treat (slowing spread and/or reducing amount resources required treat patient - ideally near 100% out-patient) depend vaccine, though vaccine still huge impact. Yeah probably intelligent enough know tiny fraction population protesting outside transmission rates lower bar, house, restaurant probably big source spread compared general population. 

I see many irritated protestors probably understand can't controlled much want. first amendment clear demonstration/protests. language bears exception rule. ""you can't protest pandemic can't protest Tuesday"".

You get contact representative say want press idea changing first amendment match needs. would go well trying change 2nd amendment. Imagine saying fire carry guns weekend. LMAO.

Edit: Can't spell  American healthcare sucks, Obamacare I've never pay flu vaccine. sure costs people without healthcare though. nonsense Amazing see people need broadcast social life social media sharing fancy dinners they‚Äôve restaurant. post getting covid, go back posting videos fancy dinners restaurants. 

One person posted getting test twice. guess they‚Äôre fearless. masochistic, bug-chasing autassassinophile desires financially dominated, that's actually fetish. it? Georgia, I‚Äôve lived 30 years **NOTHING** surprises anymore. Antibodies fallen months Spain, unreasonable think possible. Certainly, evidence isn't, given two reported cases reinfection. enough say ""Yup, happens."" certainly enough rule definitely, never happens. summer construction ... everyone going over.  dude looks he'll tell stand AC vent pass.  That's happened Dubai rolled theater months ago. ¬ø  people think can't two viruses once?

What saying. course people think that. I'm sorry see go, long time since I've conversation ardent conspiracy theorist. country believe collective action

From outside thinking. Maybe framed national security issue people would listen? COVID-19 disease. surely must many ways enemy could exploit weakness. according lot people site, seem forget Trump beat Hillary without majority vote last time, either forgot kidding themselves. Tbh watching customer get tased give satisfaction. \[fall\] guy another. mean could also longer lockdown. see 6,000 dead soon disaster, also create counter-strategy.

He's comparing covid black death, one comparing little flu. part problem. remember swedish fanboys weeks saying ""Why criticize Sweden, even 5000 deaths?"" asked ok criticize Sweden 5000 deaths, answer.

You see? Everybody makes mistake everybody wrong. refuse admit proven wrong once, twice, tenth constantly six months, big problem. point start distort reality fit delusion. want like that. I'd kind say major reason President actively trying interfere testing, actively encouraging people wear masks, actively encouraging people gather extremely large numbers... far development? Americans continue maimed die... teachers afraid. Parents terribly irresponsible. kids fevers send school Tylenol. call take home, one answers.

But idiots government can't surprised told everyone kids get nothing happens them. picture there, people evil Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically.

I'll give link below. drill explanation risk assessing given measure state overall, explain 5 10% positive test rate threshold state country city whatever considered adequate testing. high percentage positive test rates usually indicates broadly testing enough, symptomatic sick getting tested.

Covidactnow.org Idaho 5th nation new cases per capita last week. Georgia, Florida, Alabama Mississippi worse. Hardest hit counties last week Shoshone, Canyon, Lemhi Bonneville. gonna need big life alert smugness. inability entertain may believe one believe minority people time, luckily, opportunity learn bigger picture

That smugness, delusion. tricked thinking uncovered overarching group theme series events connects isolated random incidents altogether. Bill Gates can't even release windows update without bricking shit ton PC's highly doubt he's competent enough pull something many many people involved.

This basic critical thinking. Please read something, try think reasons true. seems outlandish farfetched; likely is. Right, previous comment seemed flippant whether political leaders South bore responsibility bad there. issues bringing things southern politicians done actively make worse, yes, Southern Republicans share much blame tens thousands unneeded deaths hands.

Ron DeSantis killed Americans Osama bin Laden. People already wearing masks dude. There‚Äôs much else besides forcing schools stay closed another year. Even states Republican governors dont mandate schools choosing close anyway really think live EU... depressing though? Two states NY NJ long since seen huge spikes cases.

Five area schools closed morning due ""infections"". thanks ... aaaannnd forecast based people like taking much anything seriously. Sure it‚Äôs far less frequent lots Covid tests sitting car.... Everyone: get flu shots wear masks. everyone two things we‚Äôd able get fall nothing bruises. dysfunction goes higher that. forced spend months waiting state provide guidance. guidance strict. point aren‚Äôt sure students eat outside. state also expecting hybrid models. I‚Äôve seen everyone running around trying comply top rules. Instead one size fits regulations need start school ask make safest students, get buy-in school community, expert review plan. Yeah, ever that. Ever. Maybe hospitals. one work. get sick call every day feeling 100% well let come back work. I'm Oregon, though. Also, hit decade first antibiotic came out. So, many survived initial immune response, already weakened died opportunistic bacterial infection afterwards. Please vote person November, physically able to.

I understand lot people afraid showing polling site cycle but, please.... PLEASE.... give excuse enablers current occupant Oval office invalidate mail-in ballot.

Instead, take advantage early voting State avoid crowds. think take fall Kathy  85% Floridians best remember political party problem sacrificing kids health welfare, otherwise deserve outcome agree, pull police neighborhoods let kill other

By wearing masks. Obviously mean Emperor. Trump blamed lot problem president result explored systemic problems US.

Systemic problems intentional eroding trust government, science media. problems got us president. Social inequity (meaning people work) predate ... Well country. gotten worse, can't blame Trump. General short sightedness selfishness also nothing new country, occasionally rise (WWII exemplifies sides this). 

Trump though, blamed much problem. antagonistic, also conciliatory dialog China think partially blame paying disease early on. Even consistently strong stance there, undercutting world bank. UN left zero accountability actions world stage. amplified message Russia. 

Trump also cut entire task force set monitor potential plagues, set response Ebola. pulled CDC workers China shortly happened. absolutely insane sporadic (and ineffective) travel bans. mention slim suit crown brought sow chaos profiting pandemic. 

This top three years systematically reducing efficacy agencies. 

At personal level, tweets supporting crack science, playing issue, supporting anti mask open xxx tweets refusing wear mask long think directly lead many people taking less seriously. America fucked, one hand pandemic coronavirus pandemic retarded Interesting response..... temperatures specifically New York City warmer winters due warmer ocean water, moist air south, urban heat island. Upstate NY rest interior northeast experience cold air damming Canada. Italy surrounded weather ocean water helps milder winters. course exceptions Alps much like exception NYC coast. Funny thought dystopian part total failure federal government take seriously, sure masks stuff.. fall general cause huge uptick virus cases regardless mutation.

ftfy Funny kinds comments allowed stay American don‚Äôt understand either.. Wait, masks on, sanitize regularly (wash hands/hand sanitizer) figure worse? suspect better mitigation efforts play, unless places support illness spread disease. else do? like lock large swaths country. Can't give either. certainly thought would Yea, run mindset time--""eh, 1-2% mortality rate bad!"" Yea, talking size US population, would bring us standstill.

Biden isn‚Äôt going suddenly change minds anyone. Everyone voting get trump out, one actually wants him. people voting don‚Äôt even believe him. Except Spain, UK country marked numbers make look better far.

As already explained, British covid death numbers incorrectly inflated - anyone inch knowledge situation knows grotesquely undercounted. Thanks new ""revision"", UK first-world country greatest underestimate covid death toll. bye Watch movie crazies, really happening üòÇ Person, woman, man, camera, TV. bye doesn‚Äôt seem like anyone power U.S actually ability willingness fight virus, like live CA Newsom seems keep tweeting ‚Äúwear mask‚Äù without really plan place (tho mask effective) powers pretty much resigned ‚Äúoh well guess live it‚Äù Doucey screwed us hard. ‚ÄúHere‚Äôs benchmarks pass order reopen schools. Oh, opening anyways? Ok, support that‚Äù. Lol one making claims, burden proof you. penguin guy pointing asshole sake it, instead putting actual argument up. Congress adjourning addressing major issue sounds familiar. Congress seems done countless times last 20 years.

The current U.S. congress literally useless send citizens...we sending best. initial Japanese outbreaks recent surge started host/ess bars night clubs, people wearing masks. lol profit medicine thats hilarious need get it. People dying. enough motivator, mind. expected, unfortunately.

Superman saved Beijing? 1918 Spanish Flu: 15-50 million deaths

Out 500 million infections. We've 20 million Covid infections (800k / 20 million ~ 20 million / 500 million). Hopefully get 500 million. know much investigate, running rampant. like 4% jumped 10%. Texas get control. lopped penis attractive? Like actual f, amirite? like sweden, right?

/s We're getting there. There's already idiot Florida sheriff done that. deputies wear masks people coming facility can't either. Want report crime? Better ready risk life pleasure. Ok cool. I've kind bummed many cases reading something like headline 20 year old getting bad case COVID turns 300 lbs diabetic I'm wary anecdotal accounts. Sure may damage dont know isnt gonna kill them.

The long term effects disease unknown point.

Best part big experiment possible that‚Äôs sure. one lethal still hit states pretty hard tens millions infected. sad lonely kill people contagious. people around favor keep putting position could infect them; way become infected spread it. social important alive. I've hearing Tokyo rest Japan? Okinawa?  mean vaccine common cold? I'm following saying Cornell really, no.

Absolutely comparison nations millions people. see deleted comment, here‚Äôs response.  

 

 

Since I‚Äôm US, it‚Äôs understood America means US. 

Saying ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù meaning, fact US centric it‚Äôs taking way think US saying ‚Äúright‚Äù way, fact people think differently use word differently. ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù meaning. different contexts means different things people involved. 

If choose one group people say use ‚Äúright‚Äù way, yes, centering thinking around one group people. much cases undercounted, I'd imagine least 5% Americans infected (the reported number ~1.6%) Getting 60-80% herd immunity would factor ~10-15x, 1.5-2.3 million deaths. Still ridiculously high, would incredibly stupid us use strategy. think hoax though? That's leadership either. That's knee jerk authoritarian reaction handful new cases. That's like invading innocent country passing sweeping surveillance national security bill people may die terrorism \*ahem\*. mean sure, theoreitcally snoop everyone arrest people will, full security terrorist attacks... digress...

New cases going **impossible** contain, until, big if, vaccine works people get vaccinated. true tiny, remote, sparsely populated island nation effectively one international airport regional airports. Even harder Europe Americas much larger coastline land borders. live globally connected world.

And yet, lauded contact tracing testing program, go back hard lockdowns ordering people shelter place shutting non-essential business?

That's sustainable. always slips cracks. next, someone accidentally breaks quarantine, cargo worker gets infected, shut nation suspend everyone's liberties again?

Bring rate infection something overwhelm healthcare systems, accept another disease everyday risk life must live get vaccine? can't lockdown long one. single. case. fever didn‚Äôt go 100F, I‚Äôm ‚Äúlong haul‚Äù covid patient. affect vaccines.

Lives.

This medicine. playing people's health life trials. Remember, COVID still cure. trying figure prevent disease decimating thousands. [1918 pandemic mostly killed young turning strong immune system them. wonder students havent...i mean, bunch turned Greta climate change. do. before..not much. That's man. one race poor. ""apolitical"" States quite political matter fact I‚Äôve seen people saying getting awards Yet people allowed make fun countries except China reason rumor going around drug trafficking. like people smuggling contraband going go due process.

But - - rumor. can't believe using ""democrats blaming trump"" example democrats politicizing virus. No, Trump deserves blame, genuinely done continues horrible job leading country pandemic. feel like insanity response especially January March forgotten.

The politicizing democrats hydroxychloroquine. That's actual legitimate criticism. 2 weeks ""Queen Creek High School baseball coach dies Coronavirus lashing teachers willing teach person fear disease""  Russians Russia guinea pig first inoculated LOL think gets slammed people would lose freedom PORSCHE GET DOG pay 15% first 60k earn year... don‚Äôt need one. us, say American mean someone US. thats American exceptionalism, good boys, ya know, anything, cause God bless America ;S true. get test day 3 12 quaretine can't leave without returning negative test. One doctors involved study resigned due shit ethics rushing vaccine giving people without adequate testing could hinder harm (or possibly standards vaccine studies high cost great.

Btw unlike USA, Russia socialized healthcare. already paid vaccine receiving ""free"" taxes. \*looks Germany* working brain vaccines dont give 100% immunity... Masks thing long time come. think that's case. least that's impression reading literature since Covid-19 often compared virus infections order demonstrate unique features. hand, may need data understand common really are. Yes Republicans pushing regressive taxation plan exploding deficit. active website absolutely zero correlation beliefs level political activity. 1917 would led violent revolution.

Pretty sure America learned deal assholes French.

If Marie Antoinette said let eat cake response peasants plight.
This essentially rich Privelaged way saying 'Suck dick'

Well... bullet sounds every language every revolution.
They trap sowing now. cooked home, I'd guess made Beyond brand burger. people find smell off-putting, moreso original version stopped selling year ago, still there's complaints new one, (I personally mind either haha).

The Impossible brand ground beef still newly stores outside California and, afaik, sold Kroger line stores 12oz grounds, premade patties.

And could way here! I'm throwing comment line complaints I've heard Beyond, super common hear people mixing brands since they're new. apologize I'm totally quickest vaccine record took 4 years complete (for mumps). im skeptical im told ready within year government suddenly backing kodak make covid drugs. California starting think country something drinking water making everyone insane.

It's called ""Fox News radio"" Judging masks gloves see littered local state park, I'd say people forgotten. I‚Äôm sorry hear that, know I‚Äôm lucky. pointing best crazy time. Honestly sure would want come time. We're big fucking mess whole lot reasons. seems pretty hit miss grocery stores ‚Äúlimited capacity / mask Tuesday/Thursdays‚Äù. need groceries, aren‚Äôt comfortable things going back normal, go tuesdays thursdays. 

And grocery store workers?  Orson TV only, thus exist. One coworkers... riot. need somewhere vent relevant. tested negative COVID becoming sick. decided since *she* negative, going throw birthday party son. Apparently, negative results extend everyone else planet! Amazing! Consider getting indoor trainer bike riding Zwift. become lifeline physical activity ability feel like I'm outside riding nature. office job sent us home, us come (unstaggered, hindsight stupid back March things really went FUBAR) us pick equipment take home. can't schools same? Yeah, happens measles, poxes, norovirus. sure sars-cov-2 yet know they're studying I‚Äôve always wanted see California, Mom suppose go year annual mother/daughter trip Coronavirus happened :( Tru took less four years much damage.

Nah, groundwork goes back least Nixon. there's that, also president openly trying interfere upcoming election  sight...out mind.   
    
People got get attention. Honestly feel like vaccine widely available (those want easily get it) become matter natural selection. That's literally way deal anti vaxxers, either take it, get seriously sick die covid risk getting covid. Sure mean people still get sick die it, that's solution anti vaxxer problem point. There's reason punish everyone else idiot conspiracy theorists vaccine comes data back safe effective very, much. work data systems NYS hospitals. = colleagues going darkkkkkkkk winter :/ Last update author marshmallows overrated. Fuck vacation, bring ‚Äòem back Fauci Vaccines going shit Anti Vaccines crowd show up. r/jokeoveryourhead don‚Äôt believe it. People aren‚Äôt dying many should. would believe 10 times people dying - would also make lot anti-maskers believe fucking virus real. God, please kill people remaining live without fear. gives people false sense security, that's detriment true security.  Bro 12 hour shifts hardly friends. Nights long even work. Getting dog helped bit though. Right stay home dad fiance makes 6x much earn month get judged lazy ridiculous. Yeah, thought maybe could get agoraphobia PTSD becoming disabled abused last year, year took dreams, balled up, threw hot dumpster. ): Nothing weird that. Nothing see folks, fall line! Eh, get new flu vaccine every year. coronavirus vaccines based existing ones. 6 week old baby could go back time wouldn't. I'm terrified us pandemic Yea man, grew blue collar area. (Mining logging) nicotine alcohol common. (As well meth heroin) quit nicotine last year hardly drink socially. Smoke eat edible every night though. morning toker guy, know people function fine. we? right, I'm sorry. Even me, need push harder. Even I'm deconditioned, anemia resolved now, hard get past feeling shitty. athlete kid depressing hell get winded going upstairs.

I get tired BS. absolutely hate people pass obesity normal. looked friend support establishing exercise routine responded ""I'm fatter you, fine way are"" BMI 30.

I guess I'm hoping world start approaching things balance. make people feel horrible overweight, overweight people feel offended attacked people worried health. fat-shaming movement idiocy spitting face science people simply following science based healthy lifestyle.

I'm glad exchange. Health problems not, want better. Thanks motivation. Ooh...the latest Hunger Games sequel. Every species procreates sex ""sexual"". That'a sexual means. species fuck others bearing violent are. Lol clear anybody concerned, grocery shopping leave door. well taken care of, age concern lack socializing compared BC (before COVID19 lol), fact don‚Äôt see changing next winter.

Also locked inside, keys house. That's nice succinct summary wrote. would agree , vanilla left trying appease bern bro‚Äôs radical left , make mistake Biden swayed pretty far left . Ps : respect Bernie , years ago wanted crush millionaires , Ofcourse became millionaire , switched billionaires .  Also $15/hr proposed find wasn‚Äôt even paying people $15 wage &amp; lay bunch afford higher rate . Feeling defeated worst. got diagnosed Celiac's disease, wanted die. hated alive, hurt much. I'm grateful pushed 25 years. Sure pandemic sucks finally feels like something life.

Hopefully government realizes people feel helpless riots coming unless fix shit. think elections go well, could see beginning end pandemic, Biden looking create millions jobs put green energy infrastructure. really help economy bounce back. long still hope election, there's still light end tunnel. Many counties/states around country making similar decisions regardless party affiliation. entering chaotic chapter story. private health insurance thing. Nearly every country universal healthcare. Depends who's president! Risking life at-risk people know get away little rain. This

Hurricanes Real Shit that's prepare, DeSantis slightest. like government plans/operations use word ""Hammer"". said something ""Hammer"". Like ""Operation Crimson Hammer"" ""Operation Stalwart Hammer"". See? sounds cool. Hammer 'Rona!

Also generally want hammer steady careful, productive pace. works fast vaccine development! happen shortly across country. 18-21 year olds miss friends, put area easily access friends. expect anything different? 

It's hard blame young folks here. Sure, maybe gather, blames them? We've hard spring/summer.

This mostly schools Villanova. business bringing students back across country. Unfortunately, people need money.

People need pay bills, rent, mortgage, car payment etc.

Short massive work stoppage (which, massive enough area, would gladly join) know fix (besides making sure vote November). you‚Äôre uninsured, shots generally run $40 $60 drugstores like CVS¬†CVS,¬†0.90%,¬†Walmart¬†WMT,¬†0.52%¬†and Target¬†TGT,¬†1.12%,¬†or Costco¬†COST,¬†0.11%¬†or Sam‚Äôs Club memberships able get jabbed $20 $30. **You also find health centers near you, look state‚Äôs free discounted vaccine offerings, at¬†Vaccines.gov**

Important information.

Hopefully health care tips learned year help diminish impact influenza well coronavirus. Sick lot schools even hvac systems like that. Scientists say true guess Im Europe seems like...do americans see both? Universal healthcare option people purchase private top universal want immediate robust care? 

You lol. people's parents. know lot taking care kids right now.l that's important get things control.

That would require admitting lockdowns democrat-fabricated hoax so... DeSantis decided to! alarmist headline. comment lol

:D COVID-19 positive overdosing, way go. people accepted 9/11. little wait time ensure safety flight right?

With budget almost $8Billion FY20, you‚Äôd expect effective efficient. can‚Äôt remember exact years audits performed Homeland Security, success rate 75% 95% smuggling banned items (I.e. guns, bombs) undercover agents. They're straight defunding post office, removing things decrease post office costs removing physical mailboxes areas pandemic

Again, stand chance winning fairly. chance winning underhanded tactics, someone office poor judgment skin orange hair looks like cotton candy made piss. surprising considering NY through. One would think people would believers masks physical distancing. get making schools like prison prevent school shootings, this?? happened student safety??  Even half people wear masks, flu less transmissable still, good news nowadays. luck nobody give two shits GOP congress screeching about. still understand guys completely shut border non essential stuff. Stuff like going Alaska dual citizenship whatever essential. liars using excuse go country fuck all. Like multiple sources? really pained read. I‚Äôm fucking sorry son go that, like kind cosmic Lucy pulling football away Charlie Brown last second. hope he‚Äôs okay :( agree, completely onesided vote. blame Republicans. blame goes directly Cheney, Rumsfield, Powell Bush! squandered opportunity see great country united way. amazing united country 6 7 months became polarized. Even today. need national strategy. can't let foolish governors like DeSantis drag everyone down. think would rather see plugged football game pass-times seem popular today. might one way look it? everyone needs expected value academia pursuits. much diverse that. I'm saying better barely made birth nukes.. let's rock boat much. Eh? feels like pandemic started 3 years ago.  Well, it‚Äôs capitalized. Coomers? Easy classes majors, hands-on stuff? tell experience there‚Äôs textbook (or anything else) give experience cadaver lab. also saw reddit someone frustrated horticultural degree feeling like waste money online. 

Don‚Äôt get wrong, I‚Äôm decreasing exposure spread, it‚Äôs fair say in-person learning doesn‚Äôt advantages. FUCK AMERICA?

Trump president. Congress jack shit bad get wrong, handling pandemic worse anywhere world Trump hoarded squandered huge amounts resources public health like CDC. Yeah, risking childs life that. We've already seen children getting severely ill mention long-term health issues, despite low chance, gamble New York, least 237 kids, including Israel, appear Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome Children, MIS-C. state officials continue track syndrome, Centers Disease Control Prevention respond repeated requests information many children nationwide diagnosed far study published June 29 New England Journal Medicine reported 186 patients 26 states diagnosed MIS-C. researcher writing issue added reports countries, finding 1,000 children worldwide diagnosed MIS-C.

Is lot kids? total exposed. worth risking? opinion, nope, especially I'm willing risk life. vote wear masks public durring flu season on, thats pretty fucking dope Yeah people forget dorms also rules prohibiting alcohol consumption premises üòÜ even kitchen cook foo Well, doesn‚Äôt help almost one left alive remembers 1918. countries recent pandemics affecting population probably better. happy find another man culture :) Plans get together global pandemic, cancels due unfavorable weather conditions. Same!!! Good lord!  Even better numbers bad. it‚Äôs worse wow current german study also found 70% infected people developed detectable antibodies. Could case completely symptoms (around 17% study) together 70% develop antibodies. Want get real irked? Check days session year: dont even show days, especially campaiging. pro tip, you‚Äôre stabbed please don‚Äôt remove would cause bleeding. ""Virus virus?"" mean I‚Äôd probably say one hundred seventy four fuckin thousand dollars per annum still fine living 2020, yet keep seeing articles need paid more. need paid damn much retain ‚Äúquality politicians‚Äù, hell pay teachers little refuse pay ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt want people money.‚Äù 

Goddamn sides bench pissed days literally playing politics peoples lives they‚Äôve living well long don‚Äôt even remember it‚Äôs like damn peasant like rest us. sides least agreed another relief check can‚Äôt put one thing forward without attaching riders know side going refuse work with. 

Throughout highschool college felt government cared people least degree. don‚Äôt think give two shits us. I‚Äôm probably going list shit, hell gonna take people band together storm congress White House? adult is? Voting least damaging candidate barely represents hoping god reform may never come? world going get shittier shittier people positions wealth power solidify claim keeping us drip-fed enough survive? God I‚Äôm ashamed American. Fuck Mitch &amp; rebublicans senate care &amp; shows everyone throw blanket statement Americans? mean American politicians? Yes 70% America agrees rest world there. become laughing stock response virus, response racial inequality etc... majority us fucking tired it....  NY great right now. initial surge happened well Cuomo could anything. response drastic improvement speaks volumes and, importantly, implementing basic mitigation strategies do. 

I cannot speak California. lol. Haha, yeah came say TERRIBLE example: possibly worst American history! dumb shit, respirators confusing government lying us offering help American people left everyone confused proliferation fake/ineffective masks Democracy Well sounds like would miss low grade fever, would catch severe one. Unfortunately, still useless someone severe fever would probably already know that... Hating America trend right now. is, best ignore it. part lunacy U.S. system quarterly profits. ACA 80% must spent, FFS quarterly! zero long term strategic planning. Human lives function quarterly earnings call. immunity lasted three months would seeing reinfections. enourmous pool people infected late March, early April would showing reinfections already. 

All signs looking good immunity, shouldn‚Äôt questioning without actual data support skepticism.

[Even recent study medium term immunity showing strong support  blanket temp range silly anyhow. run little cool, I'm healthy consistently measure high 97's. also rarely get sick, I'm 99, know something up. 

Always thought wierd heard podcast explained came 98.7 ""average human temperature."" doctor took temps something like 10,000+ people sometime mid 1800's taking consideration whether sick healthy. average skewed warmer healthy be. reality, people range 98 99, fairly consistent temp. TSA part DHS. They're one same.  Undoubtedly contribute spread virus. Americans become sensitive mentioning kind sexual preference race. 

Isn't politicizing coronavirus? efforts made stop type politicizing? 

We need treat coronavirus scientific matter, stop politically correct. matter whether black lives matter protest, pro-life protest, political rally, whatever else, condemning way. X minutes reporting BLM protest, also X minutes pro-life protest, using types language. 

Anything else letting one's political bias influence science. trust anyone lets political bias influence science. round 2. ding ding ding! way life works spend life gaining sense consistent comprehensive, forms valid ideology. less tend less capable personal growth. seek confident many answers many problems can. don‚Äôt understand anything virus all. Ignorant people like killing people dont even care enough educate yourself. Uh...store already started advertising patrons get free flu shots. Maybe times changed. wish Welsh assembly would consider mask use. got back supermarket put probably 80-100 people maybe 5or 6 (including me) wearing them. said another post, please send kids school there‚Äôs possible option to. schools don‚Äôt care even ones try able keep child safe this. Teachers already getting infected aren‚Äôt even telling staff. one going school right now. say teacher who, unfortunately, forced leave profession weeks kids come it‚Äôs safe. Trumpty Dumpty promised wall, 
Trumpty Dumpty great fall... matter says. Trump double wrong thing every situation possible, he's incapable anything else. containing long enough help vaccine. Like said live we've virus free months life going pretty close normal. course ideal international travel, expect slowly change. Patriot Act destroyed right privacy. Well, Russia never even phase 3 trial... never released data vaccine phase 1 2 trials. fact Sweden less deaths per capita GDP drop much = success story. Finland 5% GDP drop almost deaths. write article named ""Finland's success /.../""? Also, august, let's wait fall proclaim Sweden ""success story"". Utter madness much want blame Republicans war, plenty Democrats voted well. cut dry that. 3000 people died! Patriot Act, DHS, AUMF, Fly List, RealID bipartisan authoritarian advancements came aftermath 9/11, directly responsible powerful Trump today.

Fun fact, major parties support keeping it, despite knowing us. What? America! politicize straws! 5318008 flip calculator around. Thank later. :) TSA hasn‚Äôt big factor stopping attacks, routinely 50%+ fail rate internal red team assessments undercover auditors attempting smuggle contraband through. biggest reason far another 9/11 style attack game changed now. Pre 9/11, hijackers typically commandeered plane, flew Cuba random airfield, dealt authorities. Passengers back large able go way, overall risk bodily harm low. 9/11 changed that, everyone‚Äôs first thought hijacking effectively death sentence everyone board. means least good chunk 200 people board going fight tooth nail overcome attacker. seen variety foiled airline - based attacks since 9/11, shoe bomber, underwear bomber, etc stopped people airplane, TSA, TSA-style organization another country. Face it, America violent country. Look history. natives way westward expansion killed them. African slaves set free, lynched them. list endless. Covid19 policy one item list. not, concerned able get hair cut. must right there.  Uh...my grandma pay every year old enough medicare. flu shot covered pretty much insurance, free.  country lockdown two months, going crazy home since didn‚Äôt want leave due cases high official lockdown imposed, went crazy home ,smoking 2 packs day binging food unlike me. really feel bad extroverts US, since friends socializing fucking hard people like us. Well new VP candidate compared Corona ebola get hopes Oh mean secret police? Another federal law enforcement agency originally created make people feel ""safe"" making take shoes get groped stranger, since become force people allowed wantonly mask put people unmarked vehicles without reason detain without cause?

You make complete switch authoritarian society without dipping toes water first. preaching choir. difference tragedies would immediate timing hit quickly people reacted. 

This pandemic similar 1918 drawn floating rate confirmed cases, partisan politics, misinformation campaigns, fear unknown. 

When vaccine approved? Bill Gates trying microchip us? Kamala Harris pull mask reveal really Oprah? Trump &amp; Pence face vs Kanye &amp; Dwayne rock Johnson part October surprise? get autonomous zone? cure virus hidden area 51 cool alien stuff? trump sold cool alien stuff China low? people tried raid it? tune next time America 2020! US tried make sure worst countries 911. fucking need pay this. Shall really quote Evey instance Bible recommends violence? religion. Anyone education realized result development. middle east USED progressive destabilized external nations. undeveloped nations following Christianity done similarly bad things happening name God. Oh people like get ignore little detail narrative. Yes 20% Wales spread 20,000km^2 area compaired 20% London 1,500km^2 area even 20% Sweden 450,000km^2 .... Thats relevant calculations including population density point arguing against. abnormal finish phase 3 fast. try, legit. argument used mock Russia. That‚Äôs supposed stay well away others even wearing mask..... Ouch. guys got fucked couple months late. Talking ""ethics"" trials totally voluntary, come on. meant, last 3 months. Since data probably around time. reinfections start say next month. That's meant enough data. sure way ascertain without long running data Teacher going back school full time September. coworkers confident it'll fine bc ""nobody getting sick anymore."" Despite county reporting 1,000 new cases last week. think number high? People dumb care health. Biggest pre -existing condition 100% avoidable putting fork taking walk Fauci [supported schools opening still understand people hold high regard. saying also attack aggressively talk verified sources, numbers, facts witho learn. might well yelling mirror.

If asking proof wild consistently unverified claims seen ‚Äúattacking‚Äù ‚Äúaggressive‚Äù *that* real problem. It‚Äôs attack say, ‚ÄúHey, I‚Äôd like actual information this,‚Äù believe is, well, like said before, part problem. 

Also, pretty rich question approach seems ‚Äúsay bunch things true without proof, provide proof asked, say asking proof ~THE REAL PROBLEM~.‚Äù No, asking proof wild claims baseline interacting information internet. it‚Äôs dry heat? don‚Äôt believe single second. wait; people probably get billed $1,000+ vaccine. cannot forget ""freedom fries"" right 9/11. managed politicize even fucking food back then. dare entertain possible positive outcome 32.9% figure q2 annualized. would reliable? majority cases contagious symptoms even show up. said week ago work. Someone could virus even pick thermals. could spreading around days anyone knew it. Like enforced masked social distancing across nation? /s you‚Äôre morbidly obese 80 chances becoming severely sick near zero. guess says bunch health profile Arizona teachers. Matthew McConaughey Correction: mathematicians scientists. Colombia way. 400k cases Trump announces new national propecia mandate Nope, things seems getting better compared spring. feels like everything pretty soon now. mighty albatross giggles 1500mi. One like other. Americans really fucking need take chill pill 9/11. Healthcare ridiculously expensive here. flu shots free. What? can't hear you. socializing? can't anything said loud music. Could scream louder? NYC one last states open schools. think bit much calling equivalent Fauci asking 101 type questions predecessor. 

He reads totally incompetent. Oh right one dead American worth thousands dead *others*. America done stuff like people doesnt surprise We'll find one way another. It'll probably make history books 2020 chapter.  temperature checks twice day work hate know asymptomatic people exist. hasnt depressed, mean, stuck inside one 4 months, video games, drinking, sleeping. almost sub wants coronavirus last forever. 8-15% hospitalisation bullshit supported nothing. 

Taking UK example, 133,000 people hospitalised seroprevalence studied show 5,000,000 infected.

That's 2.6%

Please make statistics present fact Joe Biden voted favor Iraq war. COIN operation approved Obama allowed terrorist cells develop flourish. Eisenhower's warning nothing new. History burned taken statue statue. history want write? one people forgot terrible humans humans? Yeah, teach us better. forgot tongue, every hour hour. Clean shit. That's rich. Dr Fauci's entire purpose act political tool. day age? People likely say *I'm tower, care? probably liberal hoax anyway!* ""Nevada test site"" campus anywhere 7 10 days already. Move first week August. bout everyone shares info other?

Oh right... Nobody gets rich way... know would kinda funny stupid serious knowwww suxxxxx ... make money He‚Äôs justifying anything, saying guys wasting time sharing scary anecdotes fear circle jerk.

My sister smart. studying doctor, ended lawyer. Moved rural Pennsylvania 20 years ago become conservative nutcase. Yesterday telling us masks help vaccine help either. Oh, knows well work, ""her side"" rationalize too. argues always work still get sick wear mask, therefore masks help mandated. always trying argue away data using anecdotes.

So infuriating propaganda done people. seems like catastrophically delicious idea. Yes...lol saw sooo many heart attacks people 30s NYC. People *shouldn't* heart attacks. go on... pretty good testing. 130k tests per day. utter nonsense leads think innumerate lacking common sense here

The rate transmission needs controlled.  virus ripping place bad business

The US higher unemployment rate EU better controlling things. Certainly challenge everyone ... 

Did read comment? works b/c stoners need go outside mingle others stay entertained. Woooaaahhh, look cat! assholes like u won‚Äôt get sick.

thanks bro. assholes like us appreciate lmao call result happen parents insist school person. parents demand parents go too. demand teachers too. parents won‚Äôt willing it. Therefore school person. shouldn‚Äôt be. know that. Yep. I'd guess people going hospital less non-covid reasons. Still great news though considering evidence covid effect heart. Okay, lets guiding.And please, point completely wrong, lets look pace disease.

Between 1918 1920....that's 2 years...the flu pandemic killed 675,000 people America. That's 2 years. 5 months, we're 170,000 many estimates saying we're already 200,000. math, remember, still 2.4 MILLION active cases remaining, even ended full-stop right now, even there's vaccine, even there's great cure, looking pace, pace 1918? 
And winter going kill \*lot\* people. Yep. take one look clock, back work, look back hour later. Ok, even planned, likely was, Biden still ended votes. makes nominee, that's democracy works. moderate base significantly larger progressive base, primary shown. Young people still selfish assholes public health. News 11. what's wrong subjecting animals lifetime suffering? or, could buy free range shit, yeah? buy factory farms. swing way side like animals treated. free range animals taste better anyways.

or could go hunt food. animals free forever, predation totally natural. No, I'm saying them... It‚Äôs frustrating bars restaurants prioritized getting elementary school kids back school year reductive rate virus transmission more. understand right Thanks doctor Americans take vaccine pandemic (where compulsory countries) Americans wear mask pandemic - makes people think would take vaccine discovered ? 

COVID still around America still struggling quite come. shit, college football isn‚Äôt happening that‚Äôs highlight fall I've heard ways. glad hear that! It‚Äôs confusing. Prove it. ""Our transmission language changed,"" CDC spokesman Benjamin Haynes told may also able get COVID-19 touching surface object virus it, touching mouth, nose, eyes.

August 13 - CDC Respiratory droplets land hands, objects surfaces around person cough talk, people become infected COVID-19 touching hands, objects surfaces droplets touching eyes, nose, mouth.

August 12th - CDC website wearing mask decency humanity true selves. little town packed tourists ever seen 

Swarms wanderers 4,000 cases 40 deaths TOTAL? Sounds pretty effective me. 2 steps ahead Oxymoron, right? Asian American, know people brought much but, way Americans feel living parents shamed needs stop. It‚Äôs financially smarter it‚Äôs learn need yourself. Taxes, bills, etc. Learning living parents aren‚Äôt mutually exclusive.

I pay entire rent parents living me, way around. know many patients long term effects...

No, don't. Funny no-one else seems know either. common anecdotes, would know now. March sure we'd October-ish, November, December, June sometime spring 2021.

Then July came around Google announced they'd allow WFH till July 2021. I'm hoping completely beginning 2022. Sorry blaming media problems seems lazy incomplete. media reflection much bigger problem.  downloaded Covinder? latest dating app made specifically pandemic. It‚Äôs media taking quotes context, really CDCs fault. agree completely.  Stop trying change subject. Lol probably cautious Covid you, get it. Everybody gets it, it‚Äôs real. wear ppe keep distance wash hands that. I‚Äôm scared damn thing. assholes like u won‚Äôt get sick. Presidents worked us long time. still money, Wall Street donors corporate lobbyists get politics. Yeah seriously, cause that's made think of.  talking again, people getting hostile like fact based data driven viewpoint?    Americans weird. country done exactly this. Perhaps could learn something. love post stopping politicization pandemic commented nothing completely politicized statements lol. Hard stop moving train, it? Yes, happen. Bernie's path nomination relied split ticket, fracturing moderate democratic base. situation changed strategy longer tenable. moderate democrats showed would rather moderate progressive, Biden got many votes. ""The United States extend ban non-essential travel land borders Canada Mexico another 30 days several states struggle contain coronavirus outbreak, top U.S. official confirmed Friday.""

As Canadians would kept border unilaterally closed keep disease infested masses south border country. Canadians chanting ""build wall"", yet? Remind well Americans holding pandemic? amount deaths Sweden insane.

5700 reported deaths, demographics dead old frail close statistical end life, nation 90000 people die every year.

Total mortality 2020 going break continuous downward trend deaths/million/year Sweden, probably still land 10-year average.

How insane?

Here's deaths/million/month Sweden past 40 years: 2020 ""insane"" year, 2018, 2017, 2009, 2005, 2003, 2000, 1997, 1996, 1994, 1989, 1985? Ludicrous, bananas, crazy, nuts, cuckoo, plaid?

You really need get better sense proportions, really need able put 2020 perspective. Yep. summer absolutely flew by. MANAGER! Jesus. Yes, universal problem humans. tend care things they're front faces. Bernie Bros irrational Tea Partiers. love conspiracy theories. Imagine wanting people suffer pandemic.

Ironic post threads spirituality love want others suffer. I'm 45 lbs obese right now. I've lost 20 lbs since May. I'm hoping lose 45 catch Covid. going take 4.5 months, here's hoping hold out. yet Congress recess Im counting 2 years. Could longer, could shorter, think 2 years reasonable estimate happens Democrats disregard recess show anyways, maybe bribed Republicans quorum?

If completely ignore norms too, getting veto-proof majority 12 hours Republicans fly back in. willing whatever takes save lives. Take 15% make work. Actually stuff like last long virus get spread much host dies quickly. It‚Äôs even PPE. work med device company, nonwoven material need product suddenly 4-month lead time companies using material face shields. 

So there‚Äôs trickle-down effect live-saving devices well Oh yeah. trying stop overtime make letter carriers work 8 full hours.

If go ahead thousands mailmen become clerks instead. New battle Right. don‚Äôt disagree. I‚Äôm saying, they‚Äôre golfed negotiations? Stay session? 
If president isn‚Äôt going sign whatever house senate agree on, hence he‚Äôs involved negotiations, either house senate stay session apart actual negotiators? clubs open ridiculous idea. area even bars still closed date re-open. Yep. People seem idea rural = hermit.

My grandma lives absolute middle nowhere always *way* socially active life have. Like, breakfast evening always used fully booked meeting friends diner library events church events billion senior citizen activities. stuff close her, think twice driving hours something either. 

It's really hurting anti-social, like staying home friends family (who also high risk age!) also staying home-- no, everyone else pretending everything fine normal still meeting masks distancing. sucks. Although frankly gonna suck whole lot Covid reach them, missing friends still hell lot better watching bunch friends die due selfish dumbassery. wishes, fairy-dust, unicorn farts.

I've never heard vaccine referred like before. Haushalter, county health department director, said 25% threshold set consensus local infectious disease experts, health department officials, **leaders county‚Äôs ‚ÄúBack Business‚Äù plan**.

Who probably get veto power rest clusterfuck. that‚Äôs comment aimed Iowa. Florida imported thousands doctors nurses help cases, many ICU‚Äôs throughout state full weeks.

Hospitals overwhelmed. Nothing operate 100% long periods time. Civil responsibility US weak, agreed.

But leaders spread lies false hopes, diminish civil responsibility, situation worse leadership deepened hole.

It's like blaming ""bad drivers"" road conditions road design force drivers making moves increase risk accidents.

Or, like blaming children graduating HS learned skills offered HS.

This called ""root cause analysis"". 

This 100% leadership failure. stop claiming 20%? going make numbers might well go big say 200%. know right also risk daughter dying...

How hard affects babies yet known. Well said coworker tell ""everything needs open up, run course"". three people get covid office dude office next guy also tested positive covid. like ""Run course? Tell coworkers past week got covid."" understand people. feel like I've taken crazy pills. atta boy!!! Well everyone knows S's can't spread among other, T's resistant, F's pay respects.

But instead T, put letter R. ‚Äúhealthcare‚Äù system country shit. don‚Äôt care aesthetics rules discourse whatever you‚Äôre trying push. 

Democrats pushing Republican legislation progressive long time. Incrementalism reason. 

Look fast 3 trillion dollars appeared thin air recently. certain things require decades compromise, apparently. Uh what? US 100 times number deaths per capita NZ. They‚Äôve easily one successful countries dealing pandemic. Yes do. Save comment. way home work post everyone see. particular, two articles last couple days talk long-term immunity asymptomatic mild cases COVID-19. last two days. post hard close soon can. go Target sanitize carts users. hand sanitizer front wipes stuff. think really good idea people's hands things, scientific consensus fomite transmission minimum infectious dose.

Cleaning surfaces inside airplane good idea passengers, Corona virus reasons, since sometimes there's little time passenger turnover.

""Deep cleaning"" thing store school someone tested positive location, want show ""doing something"" makes people ""feel safe"" coming back. ""do responsible thing""and close 24 48 hours pay company ""deep clean.""

If sanitize surfaces get touched people's hands think that's smart thing hard. Sanitizing surfaces touched nee hands like 45 min later totally different closing store 48 hours deep clean rafters get corona out. 

Possibly know already wanted talk sub sucks? Yep, I've seen multiple people flown Cabo, Cancun top tourist destinations. know state Quintana Roo even launched campaign ""welcome back"" travelers. Multiple hotel chains sweepstakes summer vacation packages....  
Even multiple friends Mexico posting vacations places. 
I mean understand places rely almost 100% tourism, stop international even domestic travel, cases going decline. Comments like NWO used fringe social outcasts. it‚Äôs coming 25% U.S. population. 

I used think conspiracy theories joke despite noting origins right-wing circles. realize always apart relatively dormant fascist movement, waiting harnessed right movement.

MAGA movement. would respectfully suggest opposite play: public run monopoly education made people believe big, centrally-planned centrally-managed schools way educate children.

School boards across country enabling home schools, small-group community ""quarantine pod"" schools, moving long term distance learning opportunities. candidates capitulated nearly-simultaneously. Yeah know. wasn‚Äôt supposed personal attack, feel like broken record.

Right now, trying get virus moderate level risk (waiting vaccine much that, even isn‚Äôt perfect). completely agree, let‚Äôs socialize moderately.

The reason socialize moderately, * months wait vaccine* , want socialize fully - limit makes sense **temporarily**.

The original comment about: ‚ÄúI could socially distance forever‚Äù. means, ‚Äúafter vaccine, might 100% perfect, could still socially distance forever‚Äù. *My* comment ‚Äúat point, choice, publicly mandated‚Äù. r/unexpextedwarmachine FL TX right behind. getting flu vaccine help mild case Covid get it? 25% ridiculously bad reach point able continue operations even want to. That's like driving car smoke flames shooting hood engine overheated welded one solid block. saying ""Maybe go get checked out?"" thrust comment. Glad caught up. Shame combative get here. . get dozens shots pull tooth. also high pain tolerance.

Edited add: I‚Äôm Texas C-19. FORTNIGHTLY MEANS FORTNIGHT; EVERY TWO WEEKS.

Also, influenza virus also RNA virus. Scientists believe coronavirus mutates slower influenza virus physical structure, similar slow mutation rates coronaviruses. matter time food surface infections would came spotlight. feel like ""re-discovering"" virus does, process many attacks, directions, immune system getting time helps us notice.

Yes, earth could government Florida plan thing happens annually. 60 billion available state income tax based population compared states. set money aside inevitable hurricanes that, again, annual occurrences Sure normal flu season, 100% everyone following 0 social distancing mask wearing guidelines. 

So half country wearing masks distancing, herd-immunity type effects prorogation influenza human networks. effectively mean live life without fear months? finished recovering.

Relax Sir, soo many states, red blue reopen, (only careless knuckleheads put everyone bus, cause re-closing).Also, may fake news 2 certain fairy networks) conspiracy theories, ty! 90s movie! nice day... Except got stuck Orson Lannister... even look study? Yes found prolonged immunity. Like 6+ months. 

They using medical research definition word, lay definition. Hey mods, purely political post removed? used get flu vaccine city government. El Paso inoculation clinics available everyone use like $15  shit! üòÖ number seems way off.. maybe that's citizens?

In county live in, Hillsborough, 50/50 virtual brick mortar options given. Would true read like that. However clearly going comments threads one similar headlines true. 

Biased right word. preconceptions looking for. also can't separate out. see big number natural react it. Headlines like obviously trying play natural reaction.

Also acting like stat can't misleading. Stats without context easily used give false impressions. Happens time Dude, same! Bought bike weekend ride Healthcare job hour every day life changer. Yes im thankful job covid 24 hours day Healthcare every day different team member getting sick covid, emotional toll taking astronomical. I'm still struggling recently-diagnosed Bipolar Disorder there's much left reserves anymore. 

But. Something getting bike going hour work, hill heat kicking ass, really bringing back almost normal. reminding something else exists besides covid wearing respirators day, that's honestly important. 

Sorry novel. Enjoy bike stay strong, everyone! There's life fear. Live safely beat this! strongly believe coronavirus deniers outspoken minority whose numbers come anywhere near numbers aren't. certainly significant number remember, majority us acknowledge reality deeply affected virus, clear side failed us exceptionally trying times get complacent fail exercise right vote. Nope, shitty fake doctors trying make money. currently ascertain short-term immunity, hedging say 50% effectiveness probably fair. would worry US frozen foods too. actually lower, include serology tests numbers get reported. tick 7% PCR only. Downvoted comments tend ones deserving attack. Like yours. Never seen bad attempt joke warranted removal. That's kinda neat.

Why brain went dog fucking I'm sure understand. seems something work on. another classic ""joke""? ever wondered people seem care anymore? I'm going take leap guess nonsense started, one cared lived, died, long affect them.
Why would think would change now, times? note, would pretend care much human life aware human rights violations decades done nothing confront issue?

I reject people's exclamations indignation regarding Karen's give shit. like Karen's anyone else, changed. see FL less 20k tests? ""choose leaders""

Well butter biscuit call Sally electoral college pick whoever want president.

There's choosing leaders people, there's 1% chooses benefit most.  Oh missed it...now really want know said. social circle whole pandemic (which IMO rated aspect ""Social Distancing"")

So true! f2f contact small group people taking precautions aspects life, chance contagion greatly reduced. enough said media, suspect part many outbreaks due family get-togethers. people impression sharing DNA means safe party, that's works all. Sweet summer CHILDREN. country enforces driver's licenses seatbelts stopping Tb patient coughing disease people?

Quite strange priorities indeed. dollar... look price gold. becoming like Weimer Republic Yes finally California comes 1st something They'll help tremendously places enough test kits. don‚Äôt disagree remarks masks didn‚Äôt help, even point leadership failures post. point don‚Äôt believe things would demonstratively better say Rubio Clinton President. wins fairly? land?

Isn‚Äôt Botox botulism? worst spring summer we've ever had, surprise anyone. Yup agree people follow guidelines social distancing, mask wearing, hand washing, etc., greatly reduced risk catching flu. 

But sadly, large swathes USA things. places rising Covid cases lot flu cases winter unless lot people change behavior. winners this. Yes think nice parents retired dealing everything right 75 many good years left? Maybe 10 lucky, probably 5 realistically super mobile, spend year locked must devastating. least get I'll decades enjoy. really odd, see rural states midwest starting tick quite bit case numbers (considering population), Idaho, whatever reason, really quick gate.  75 year old, Trump supporting neighbor told Democratic hoax back April. respects opinion, leveled gaze flatly told 10% chance dying gets it, offered one extra masks. refused then, called days later ask *two* extras, one one wife. He's wearing mask public ever since.

Fuck Trump. get multiple times Online classes campus dorm, sounds like win win colleges honestly could‚Äôve avoided whole thing everyone listened big orange guy said life go back normal really fast wore mask

Instead got ‚Äúdrink bleach democratic hoax is‚Äù American, fellow citizens brainwashed theory either Right Left (Republican Democrat). really root cause issues. Well, Trump narcissistic egomaniac zero amount empathy. I'm working ass month put together fish tank there's economy even buy supplies from. world burns, least enjoy calm aquarium rasboras. think rather UK quarantine order sparks exodus.

As people try get back AVOID quarantine announcing took effect may counterproductive, looks good if/when TV news crews show up. give two weeks schools Michigan shut down. honestly don‚Äôt comprehend think that, perspective massive shortcomings society trolling? friend goes notre dame. Minute got dropped bags went party campus. would pretty cool think Colorado far I'm going get realistically right website...it's almost care would rather spread sub. algorithms seem bias comments somehow. Maybe throw certain articles one crowd ones another don‚Äôt know. people groupthink particular way. problem ban travel China virus already Europe also real concern COVID might infect people lowered immune systems flu. make worse people already struggling recover. Even doesn‚Äôt mutate could turn one-two-you‚Äôre punch. 

We already downward curve last flu season really took hold. get see happens new flu season starts it‚Äôs still around spreading. Damned do, damned don't. Shut up. Well, that's better 70% reputable epidemiologists infectious disease specialists believe. think new low numbers ""herd immunity"" pulled someone's ass. 

CFR IFR way. respect science math pessimists. think hundred million years sun going envelop Earth make word (I got automodded using d- word used slur, whole defending word. Nice.)


 Climate change real, going bad, make ""glass half empty"" person. probably influenza pandemic lifetime, mean ""look bright side"" enjoy fact people going die horribly. 

Stop attributing someone's personality scientific beliefs. Rest world reports coronavirus CHINA non american dont understand... people moving thousands evacuate storm?!

I'm going assume live country gets hurricanes region it. Depending category hurricane, get quite severe. Hurricane Maria death toll 3,000. Hurricane Katrina hit 1,800. little storm, goal mitigate death, can't tell people stay drown. I‚Äôve read today Let's take vote! Yea Nay? Wonder false positives like 8 people know never tested due test shortage, received positive results lol So, GF (with live) going dad's second wedding tonight; Catholic church, full Catholic ceremony, bride groom insist upon going maskless wedding party without masks altar (so, eight people including priest), church okay despite state mask mandate indoor public spaces. comfortable going large indoor church gathering, skipping ceremony catch outdoor reception mask. feel bad ceremony, think boneheaded move indoor church wedding *now*.

Question is, go sharing living space event? live apartment share bedroom, office space. plan wear masks common spaces diligent hand washing sanitizing touched surfaces. Sunday morning leaving go camping/backpacking least Thursday next week (I happen contracts, time flexibility). 5-6 days isolation enough get good idea whether someone else wedding gets sick? really want go camp two weeks to, I'll need stay healthy.

**Edit: apparently bride migraine yesterday stomach bug today, yet *still* want follow thru ceremony cancel reception. doctor said two things fit symptom profile, recall Fauci saying everyone gets fever temp checks unreliable. I'm pissed still back despite knowing bad idea. do?**

**She's adult respect decision dare try control anyone, I'm worried involved well myself.**  confirm. encountered people think need PhD mathematics order understand fractions percentages. don‚Äôt think covid people getting CFS.

Unless cold never bothered you... Video deleted... School board probably thought made look bad. Fair, also around 35C Brazil moment. think little misleading say ""winter"" south way typically experience winter Northern hemisphere, since used sort comparison. men? That's think frustrating part pandemic essentially, top health officials reasonable folks know people power enact anything meaningful concerned quite literally weaponizing pandemic commit political racial genocide. literally done school day sunrise want heatstroke also cool till least 7pm. Good thing pro sports taking hundreds thousands tests. That‚Äôs I‚Äôve lot gaming online friends.

In situation must rely intelligence consideration average American, negative outlook likely scenario despite others might say sub. usual institutions look safe accurate information don‚Äôt exist right now. Fauci knows Trump sabotaging mail-in voting wants out, public safety. Why? stripper farted? surprised. Surprised like hell new York went through, surprised sounds like American laziness. hard constantly keep guard up, especially used leadership constantly instructing toughen stiff upper lip you.

It's really nothing celebrate. Considering NZ freaking small cluster cases. mentality drastically different Texas.

Lock downs certain states make sense, sure. Borders still closed neighboring states large amount cases. Canada provinces lockdown slowly eased one one based numbers.

First I‚Äôve heard could due exhaling smoke, you‚Äôre exhaling talking? like huffing puffing goes gyms closed many hard-hit areas? Ok child. say so. held quarantine facility Government qualify oppression? 

Here's definition benevolent dictatorship:

""A benevolent dictatorship government authoritarian leader exercises absolute political power state perceived regard benefit population whole, standing contrast decidedly malevolent stereotype dictator focuses supporters' self-interests"".

Check. Locking people quarantine facilities ""greater good""? Check. Depending poverty level dominant occupations families district, could mean parents *have go work* they‚Äôll homeless starve unemployment doesn‚Äôt cover needs. needed unemployment serious ongoing option school remote. Instead system failed basically everybody. seriously, needs go get rolling papers. ran out.  admire dedication willful ignorance lead probably  long tourists aren‚Äôt trespassing, what‚Äôs big deal? I‚Äôve Tahoe several times it‚Äôs always busy summer. much love idea, can‚Äôt bothered wear mask, hope happens, don‚Äôt see gaining momentum. Happy proven wrong however! snarky rude. vacuum, agree you. However, covid aside, assuming keep baby home 24/7, already justifying risk. Many parents put kids daycare. almost running joke kids sick time daycare. Even without daycare, parents let kids play McDonald's playgrounds every day without second thought deadly illness.

Given we've acted past, seems relevant compare response covid illnesses. question becomes - data show covid, stack illnesses? going total mortality, children statistically safe covid (26 deaths children 0-4 US). becomes weigh unknowns covid, like MIS-C cases long-term damage, like mention. That's personal decision.

Personally, long family friends following safety guidelines, baby their's hold. value relationships worrying unknowns. Statistically, baby likely die way 6 month check-up covid. However, unknowns, potential risk spread others, keeps distanced anyone else. worse winter mean summer slowed things down. means things kept getting winter cause faster spread, claim summer slowed true.

I think simple. large geographically diverse population.

The virus care seasons. Summer winter could easily one long ""cycle"" acceleration spreads different parts country. case, summer would slowed virus winter could still get even worse.

To vastly simplify it: assume three steps increasing values: 1, 2, 4.
1 &lt; 2 &lt; 4. Although correlate 2 &lt; 4, cause 2 &lt; 4. simple system works.

Additionally significantly factors summer vs winter hot weather vs cold weather. Current data indicates largeish groups indoors combined AC circulating virus attributes spreading virus. Ie, people Georgia/Alabama/Florida/Texes/etc bars restaurants 100 degrees outside humid. thing might happen areas freezing midwest.

Anyway, comment way intended depth. made sarcastic comment paraphrasing Trump's early march claim: virus we‚Äôre talking do, lot people think goes away April, heat, heat comes in, typically go away April‚Äù Normalcy respect virus, USA still free fall. politicize

Translation: People unquestionably agree politics.  Who's stupid enough think people get flu in-season?

(I'm mainly commenting illustrate fear kind grown person might exist. I'm actually asking list stupid people, case point escaped dummies reading this.) ""End 2021"" sounds far away point I'm grateful end sight friends tried got sick. Maybe we'll get good herd immunity data Well course not. would look bad No, think will. This. hoping Sanders -Pete ticket term, Pete - &lt;insert VP look back potential Democratic nominees shake head disbelief Biden - Harris ticket. Democratic Party worst enemy. fake  Wow, descriptive. love it.

Lets flu go apeshit (lungs)....

Seriously, gift!!!! I'm going use anyone says fly vaccine pointless. funny true! Look, hate Trump can't wait vote November POTUS VP high ranking officials tested everyday ensure government fall virus. Many people high risk age groups. sure state lockdown lead decreasing flu numbers. schools closed due lockdown. I‚Äôm never getting cancer Glaucoma Nah. Wear damn mask

no Time find new career. going concerts America long time. run small cafe we‚Äôve make *lot* changes, every time think things set way easy clean easy people understand, find new ways behave poorly. It‚Äôs wild. I‚Äôm basically following behind people signs now. ‚ÄúPlease *ask* assistance.‚Äù someone grabbed several things shelves meant way/out reach. ‚ÄúPlease don‚Äôt sit.‚Äù chairs pushed counter, stacked people keep pulling out/moving chairs sit even though verbally ask stand side. It‚Äôs getting absolutely ridiculous. says straight face knowing boss everything slow testing test results effort hide severity covid spread. Asshole Thanks. also said ""you use mail voting"". Americans continue look leadership, failed understand literally one competent enough lead. years stagnation political divide race bottom resulted leadership today. choose based lesser two evils, end always get lesser two evil, nothingness. mask others. disease primarily spread projections saliva fluids mouth nose. 

The reason America fucked one cares people around them. say ""well I'm going get anyway!"" pull masks.

They decide *for you* ""you risk it, I'm wearing mask"". 

That infuriating. People selfish pricks. Speaking Spain, people starting talk possibility new lockdown, already quietly stocking groceries, case. think close stringly march again. mortality seems rlower wabe far. also, can't afford economically. economy already tanked enough. worst economical effects first wave yet come, probably fall. using baiting language drain world energy right I'm going forefit let last word. got me! owned! reason, scary donald he'll lose Grocery Store workers...

 draw diagram? 

Please consider thier point view.

Masks work everyone wearing them. feel sorry citizens Kenya. get temperature checks aren‚Äôt super reliable, even stops 10% infected people entering somewhere, it‚Äôs worth it. agree! Even someone, unreasonable reason, thought might true known simply possibility certainly used fact decision-making. doesn‚Äôt first fucking clue. Universities don‚Äôt need it. greedy. That's thing. know easy parents all. like ""normal"" times send kid/s day care, invite old babysitter over. general, possible ""solution"" normally huge risk. one hand, could big deal, one could get sick. other, simply cannot know people get to, many people expose to, etc, literally could one decision spreads virus.

It's shitty, bad/worse decision many. really wish easier answer, feel sending kid school really worst decision, considering quickly we've seen schools spread virus among many children.

I remember kid, mom would work upwards 60-80 hours week. Many time, even 8 so, would essentially take care myself. I'd sandwich, snacks fridge/closet. Would sometimes premade dinner could eat. Would really thing. best solution, options point. said, lucky parent raised start independent, lucky comfortable independent age, even fun thing. know many parents would probably look that, safety issues that, realistically never issue, knew call 911, handle small issues cut something. Also dick anything really, would either read, homework, play box legos, get anything have. Realistically, know that's really option many parents want use, think couple might possibility? different times well, might looked upon well either. well, lets stop keeping 6+ ft apart, stop wearing masks, stop washing hands, none 100% effective give people false sense security...

lets stop wearing seat belts too, get rid rumble strips highways, stop wearing helmets riding bikes, on. K. Good luck! ""Trump's guy."" I've actually heard aging old coot (female) understanding /reasoning /self awareness what's going on. One rare I've experienced female somehow still supports misogynistic asshole. Cordyceps COVID! Well, that's true mention it. Trump weirdest instrument yet. evil person endangering literally billions dare leave home according reddit circlejerk..what one supposed do!? make sound logical argument agree you, preaching choir sub. 

People elated Fauci's remarks. wish could go 2025 possible. mentally ill lives pandemic. Naw bro. Video smoke sessions awesome. BYOW. objectively provably wrong.

According Pew Research, considered reliable source general American public opinion data, 67% Americans believe COVID-19 major threat. 46% Republicans believe major threat. rest believe minor threat, threat all, simply care enough answer question. something like 70 million American adults side, including majority Republican politicians perfectly reflecting base, always do. voters want, they're going get it. inside house. mum says hi. I‚Äôm disputing since school held outdoors kids would automatically learning outdoors. You‚Äôd learn regular content using outdoor environment. believe teachers this. teachers limited curriculum forced teach use crutch don‚Äôt know much ourselves.  I‚Äôm sorry education America failed leading think teachers teach teacher‚Äôs manual handy. better that. I‚Äôm sad blowing introduced wonderful book gained outdoors. feel like you‚Äôre wandering far point original post, looking ways argue. case forgot, recommended book children learning outdoors. don‚Äôt care read it, that‚Äôs choice. read it, appreciate viewpoint. happen think outdoor learning could work. all. That‚Äôs get flu shot ASAP. don‚Äôt want hospitalized flu possibly expose Covid. airlines murderers cleaning less schools use cleaning ‚Äúpublic health theatre‚Äù also...murderers? adds up. No. comparable timeframe would say we're August now. August 1918 2020 people dismissing illness dismantling protections. traditional cold/flu/respiratory illness season begins October, expect things get really, really bad. According Coronawiki, man, Almost 1 million people still filing unemployment collecting somewhere around $300 week average. That‚Äôs even enough money pay bills buy food. feel sorry struggling people families support. country absolutely disgraceful people run worthless. question votes cast make HARDER rig? 

If 1000 people vote, elections reasonably close (say 48%-52%) need 41 bullshit votes. 

If 100000 people vote ratio need 4000 votes. That's lot fraud much difficult gap overcome

Not disagreeing point. asking there's research available either way demonstrates issue government makes businesses exempt, lawsuits get thrown out. assume that's still goal. capitalism great? money least morals.  Much better quippy headline. article pretty quippy... So, death rates 'person months' similar NY 1918 flu COVID. sure means brain can't convert epidemic measures transmissibility mortality rate. 

On face sounds like example metric would 50 people per capita died Spanish flu 10 months that's 5 people per capita dying covid one month? Seems total quack too. Another Trump ‚Äúyes man‚Äù. They're taking vacation? Lol America. playing part acc season I'm surprised. shit....whos genius figured out? gotta get charge things asap Huh? think testing working - gvt comes starts testing random people? No, individuals people within groups getting sick individual group gets tested. 

So less people getting sick obvious result? Obviously less people go get tested. I'm sure exactly proposing here, you? medical centers supposed test people less people showing ? What's 35% explained unblinded meant though second mad dad regained sight. thought Roys Succession ruthless. Stupid thing is: paying people stay home. normal circumstances, it‚Äôd tad excessive, we‚Äôre middle pandemic.

But damn, people already working anyways, least give enough money actually buy stuff keep economy sorta running. jobs don‚Äôt exist right now. they‚Äôre normal germaphobes doesn‚Äôt make idiots. Everyone sick yet? No? Re-open then. movies supposed come end 2020. top head got:

* Tenet - August (select theaters US, theaters globally)
* New Mutants - end August (unless move again)
* Wonder Woman 1984 - October US
* Black Widow - beginning November
* Dune - December

Mulan also suppose come year, moved VOD Disney+, released, theaters.

Those approximate dates right now, unless schedule shifts virus. believe proven cases fomite transition.

The superspreader event Wuhan lift well known. Maybe get spell checker flu season may make worse may make better. don‚Äôt know viral interference works one I'm definitely getting one planned Bill Gates knew pandemic going happen he's using ""vaccine"" depopulate world particularly countries lack resources, open eyes people! manipulated media become sheeps. guarantee using vaccine. guys seem eager vaccine go ahead guinea pig  wonder happened investigations ones selling stocks corona. Seems fallen news Hey look, Dr know shit Yeah proven routes transmission droplets aerosol iirc Wow I‚Äôm sorry you. normally don‚Äôt shit states seeing Florida man see why. Florida pool idiots Karens throwing fit masks. hope guys find safe place stay hurricane. wish guys luck. I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôm selling trump meme stuff lol. probably make Florida coughed blood Yup. want blame Democrats Senate decided wait week benefits expired even putting forth legislation. Summer break start summer over. LOL. people stupid, amount school help. lost cause. blame them? They're south. said (possibly Newsnight?) there's problem today's data, that's released yet tonight. That's good idea WW2 ended 1945 think that's generally unavoidable would probably best keep 6+ feet distance time take mask drink. ‚Äúfear currency threatener‚Äù

jackie chan confused.jpg fucking benevolent. peak mid April? 

That logically exclude summer vacation positive effect well. think people angry deliberately choose go polling station,in person.

Maybe landslide loss Trump! Ok. makes sense, based this, order g ok back life knew 2019, would higher percentage herd immunity, right? Yeah, well, _painfully_ obvious government take us, employers, seriously. Maybe time show little muscle show mean say, ""We're sick shit!"" want Janelle/Kaysar/Ian HoH please Didn‚Äôt claw back raises couple months ago cause pandemic over? guess Walmart smarter, never gave raises bonuses dictatorship, junta anywhere notorious 'creative' accounting

At least confirmed hyperbolic stupid everyone previously believed. congrats that, guess?  Mistress apartment catch bunch Fuck GOP fuck younif support pigfuckers. guys need make fuckers terrified you. too!!! it‚Äôs getting worse. live Flagler Co.

You trying frame straw-man argument completely ignores protective side mask, primary purpose! discussion having, points made above. 

If virtue signaling cloth makes feel better, you. Yikes. think family lives rural? coworker‚Äôs daughter goes already tested twice since school started... Great, moved $ back stocks today. many people asymptomatic, bet total infected number 2020 far greater what‚Äôs reported.  think close number needed herd immunity kick in. soon does, virus disappear overnight. Sue US govt lost wages due gross negligence Why? That's pretty good theory. Yes get that. Germans made law.  Wow! smart human everyone!! Look!!! person thinks they're smart person!! plan help provide name calling, lol!! Okay bright person bring smart mouth ideas.... ü§î?? 
Hmm....figure, think any. Yep a

Since decided call everyone names instead coming ideas help need shut let adults talk. :) first glance people might walk away impression short story impossible tell atm. 

Weekly averages started Bob positivity rates still high means there's probably good amount people catching via testing. labs experiencing delays week return results. good Memorial Day...right around Newsom got pressured skipping Phase 2 complaining businesses, cases nation. Thankfully death rate still fairly low, hope things turn around infection rate soon. One cousins California offered 110k plus healthcare live guesthouse teach pod 4. ""yeah hardly kids get die this""

Yes, specifically largely isolated anyone. Low numbers plan. States can't spend money they're allowed run deficit budgets cratered right now. need federal help forthcoming. think teachers start truth rich America completely line keep demanding sacrifice pay us less increase workloads .

We make rich ..rich they've forgotten american consumers employees join together reminding that. saying since day fucking 1! (of reopening). live south Texas, tourist town.. given weekend Fri-sun, resturants PACKED. Obviously masks inside..a close down.
 believe bars closed here, resturants is, opinion #1 source spread. 

Simply one person spread almost entire restaurant..this BASIC thing. take rocket science figure unless Greg Abbott Worse.

Most kids live. then, children, know got covid forced go school lose family, possibly grandparent parent, covid kids able trace time sick.

Thousands children believe fault parents‚Äô death.

It‚Äôs going horrible.

Addendum: won‚Äôt children‚Äôs fault almost every case (to handle pedantic case malicious cougher). school‚Äôs parents forced schools open, despite able work home; government‚Äôs didn‚Äôt respond allowing parents money live didn‚Äôt work didn‚Äôt send kids day care (school) every day.

Teachers reading this: ready console children care. going bad, it‚Äôs kids‚Äô fault. Hey look, another American republican know everyone! heh, probably not. response simply clean school indicates fundamentally understand problem. advice people retainers time? probably watching hands before/after touching retainer eating that‚Äôs really option anymore since school back might even call Deplorable I‚Äôm simply skeptical vaccine rushed market faceless pharma corporation, negative side effects. Whifff everyone going get sick every time eat drink indoors there's clearly link people dining drinking indoors spread deadly virus. may make big difference get vaccinated certainly do. need start arresting administrators schools reckless endangerment children. could test controlled experiment? way would people touch surfaces coronavirus touch eyes/nose/mouth see happens course ethical novelty disease lack effective treatment options. People like rest do-omers sub call down.

Exaggerating mortality rate, saying die, worst virus ever, fucked, oh noooooo 10000% ever lasting symptoms reinfection 10000% possible!!11!! fake ""first wave"" also feature 1918 Pandemic. look cities, slow growth October 1918. places like London one discern early peak, fairly small.

However, infection grew outward wave deaths aggregate appear create peak, trough, massive peak. Sounds like good start. think important President United States? What's helped daily exercise routine. Cardio particular. put album want give good listen run ends. Add time sun vit really feel much better. getting apt away desk/internet news/stress makes everything bit manageable triggered post-influenza well (as viral infections). Something aware sure. one first states lock down. aren‚Äôt improving? gotten significantly worse. massive failure leadership. lot Senators Congressmen need replaced November along Trump. also PhD common sense!! true. question going strip clubs, even open?  Dude please stop saying that, SARS MERS provided immunity. common cold exception common cold majority time rhinovirus anyways.

Covid big problem USA flawed nations like Brazil Russia. developing countries managed get control following rules months solid strategy place. Nope, wrong. used 1934. things unprecedentedly bad Dems keep saying, think would use power stop it? Apparently things actually bad Pelosi Co. Activists peacefully occupy major roads railways across country demands met. would require lot less manpower general strike could still cause massive economic damage. I'm sad getting inundated. mother's family small town 70 miles West Yellowstone. 2nd cousin &amp; wanted go get stories older relatives genealogical collections. look scenary. jeez, would never dream traveling right now. would devastated brought virus extended family.

People care less ever. conditioned fight amongst wealthy clean whatever left taking garbage fire.

My heart goes suffering me, good luck. Sounds like lot people got new boats, cars, home upgrades. one held accountable. Great job America /s biggest upset balance power Congress limiting house representatives. It‚Äôs capped 435 since 1911, since then, population US tripled, population growth centered coastal cities ‚Äòblue‚Äô states. knew! listen me?! vast majority universities literally nonprofit.

The handful pretty shady. conservative regions.

The lack response backfired completely. 

All right wing folks flipping us grave morbidly humorous. idea seroprevalence is? close 20%? theory exciting shit far know, outdoor transmission everyone wearing masks basically happen. trust kids/parents pretty safe. main risk people kids approaching you, can't control. haven‚Äôt seen brown rain since Afghanistan! Excited number games. virus evolved make people want party also deathly afraid PPE... that'd mighty successful virus. Whatever portion population making $100,000/yr $50M-illion stands problem. 

Not necessarily. Someone value $50m (or definitely someone MAKING $50m year) definitely enough money influence local regional politics. see things like Flint getting poison water public schools state funding cut, that's helping lobby decisions made.

Definitely people net-worth measured billions influences politics different level, that's say people measured tens millions stake table. Excess death calculations nothing change fact Sweden leader COVID-19 deaths. hope I‚Äôd better age, knows. Kids age kind inherently dumbasses, school reopening plans need account social consequence selfish asshole anymore. Stores let idiots wander around easier kicking out. Managers pressure employees come sick willing hire enough people account sick days. Preachers exhort flock go without masks mark devil.

Standing morons individual downsides. one thank it. especially lucky may get assaulted, fired, shunned trying right thing.

We fucked. better idea. 
Do it, sure, general strike thing short violent revolution might actually change something. Fuck them. can‚Äôt believe took break without figuring anything else. touch they? think say ‚Äúoh weren‚Äôt around expect us do?!?‚Äù called months ago, states started open back up, going point exhaustion beyond us still take things seriously would begin ‚Äúassholes.‚Äù people would get tired constant vigilance, cautious among us would look like wusses ruining everyone‚Äôs plans. 

Honestly goes til 2021, there‚Äôs going lot broken friendships relationships. There‚Äôs room compromise something like this; think you‚Äôre careful health, side thinks you‚Äôre prioritising ‚ÄúbAd sCiEnCe‚Äù relationship, worse‚Äîthat you‚Äôre virtue-signaling SJW bullshit, BAM, relationship ruins. I'm terribly afraid country going shatter stress. urban/rural, left/right divides strong moderates pressured pick side. There's seriously dangerous discourse happening makes afraid people going start shooting other.

""Why can't get along?"" sounds like stupid hippy platitude best describes feel right now. want us band together figure beat virus together. can't even get family stay video call together politics comes though. Original comment satire. know hurricanes big deal, family impacted Ike. comments article read though people evacuating something wrong. dont brush gums. want brush along gum line softly. brushing hard cause gum damage erosion. think pressure trying clean surface tomato without breaking skin.

also flossing (and even important) limiting sugary/acidic foods, especially liquid form (soda, coffee etc) hang teeth (candy). limiting time saliva ph acidic, mostly. Tell truth, time going fast good case. Feel like time passes by, closer Election Day solution pandemic like outcome, agree principle Senate. instance stop thinking US single 'America' common interests union States made like-minded constituents (though argued like-mindedness spans across population density - urban vs rural - rather geographical region), makes sense state get equal representation. Kind like European Union - everything voted member nations, popular vote across member nations. original Union based concept.

The problem federal government collects much taxes what's done gets decided small number people, rather majority. increase state taxes minimize federal taxes - states agree pay federal system based vote constituents, think would make sense. Considering world crumbling around us waiting...yes..pick fucking pace. Well three quarters American population mindless sheep following complete fucking hack name Fauci surprising. Again, hope you‚Äôre right. don‚Äôt develop immunity Coronavirus infections haven‚Äôt assessed T-cell response actually means. It‚Äôs say ‚Äúsuggest‚Äù. Although findings could explain NY stopped infections would pretty much mean US us choosing solid strategy compared rest world. 3 weeks. must expecting us get around 2k deaths day next week two. passes 1,700 back number 1 cause daily deaths America again. Start religion, it‚Äôs cancer least still job. He's getting better. We've got talking therapist, stay home order actually helped that. trying find one before, there's many secular ones long wait lists. order went effect even though online sessions offered, guess lot people wanted in-person suddenly choice 2 3. helped immensely. there, done that. blow hookers bed tendies losing everything shorted Elon god damn adrenaline rush totally forgot sitting Wendy‚Äôs looking totally free insider trading information leads bet using margin possible Hertz calls back game you‚Äôre totally thinking next move shorting SPY.

Over 100 politicians killed last election cycle Mexico. Let's go Oxford it. Save us No.

Only Congress control money. Trump's unconstitutional executive orders move already allocated money around, shift burden states, defer tax. can't actually anything useful. Government knows crack skulls seditious behavior ends. many countries reopened schools without outbreak? person anxiety much time home going work really bad mental health. alone intrusive thoughts. days worse others. Well options idiot deeply corrupt life long politician owed friends life long debt people currency.

No matter bad think is, could worse.  Oh boohoo, shut societies ruined global economy butthurt join madness.
If afraid Sweden, travel here. defense, ClsyBarSexyGuy bit expert sexiness Hotels definitely high risk, classes lower. Community colleges, grad school, honors classes generally less likely infect many classes range 5-60 delays sadly costs lives That‚Äôs entirely true. European nations locked getting second wave. NY Sweden aren‚Äôt. can‚Äôt run virus forever. catch you. least there‚Äôs widely available vaccine. actually argument mass movements hindered rather aided organizations unions organizers. 






Basically goes mass movements stopped right point true change, organizers compromise/betray movements small concessions personal gain. 



Don't get wrong pro union think mass movements successful hampered people compromise. unsettling people complain giving extra 650 unemployment payments... smh. Shameful people. General strike? think time literally burn Senate down. Burn DC. Burn all! One tweet equals may Americans? I'm btw...these damned politicians.. union president discussing breaking Taylor Laws town hall yesterday. That's bad things are. like ""you could terminated, could arrested. We're going talk it.""

Explicitly said table he's consulting legal it. Oh good thank goodness Republicans never take responsibility endless fuckups. blame sides! funny pick comment others comments article sentiment (without sarcasm) try living family take seriously (having friends without masks, going beach trips, etc), despite working primary school healthcare elderly patients. super frustrating.

Stop projecting deep know people feel me. one credible (mis)interpreting bet losing, dying horse.

What? Misinterperting what? fact places report 5x less actual covid deaths? feel like I'm talking brick wall. I've given everything need. ofc believe want truth there. next time make claims know what's what. Sorry Sweden burden political scene. never understand people. concerned first step taking valuable actions. large number people politicized virus taking steps prevent additional sickness, permanent injury, economic damage, widespread death. even actively intentionally taking actions increase spread. People think flu, think hoax, think go away election hits, think dangerous etc etc. beliefs spread social media cause direct harm everyone involved. need stay concerned become simply numb incompetence fellow people. need try best educate other. concerned least doing. Facts! Gonna steal quote. ""strike"" truly bring change majority country votes third party.

My entire industry, live music, decimated. thirty year old management company; gone four months. job held twelve years; gone four months. reason: bands can't perform live. That's it. I'm complaining; safe thing do.



But needed help.



Our cash reserves, zero income, lasted month. Luckily, PPP kicking then; forgivable loan, could survive. ended July. zero income months, boat late April. 2021 mapped April; August nothing scheduled. Nothing. now, less 10% business occurring, likelihood closures continuing, government help sight, we've forced close doors good. 



So applied unemployment. Unfortunately, extra $600 longer force. Thankfully, I'm saver savings cover gap quite time; I'm single live alone. Basic necessities cheap; rent alone $1,050 / month. little leftover state assistance, I'll barely enough buy groceries. I'm certainly upgrading 5G, singing lease new car, like; although, may splurge buy prescription sports googles. know, seal vision clouding due facemasked breath steam. Livin' dream!



I happily apply whomever me; again, entire industry decimated. I'd surprised ANYONE business today tomorrow next day. mind switching industries, think myself, ""The world fucking pandemic!?"" would love go back school; obviously, poses category problems.



Sometimes think, ""It's me; feels extra bad industry nuanced. Surely, people going back work fairing better?"" city quiet. block, see nothing 'for sale' signs. They're popping left right; street that. People abandoning neighborhood. Then, realization forced upon me; without prospects assistance, may need move. apartment already vacant; one too? new trope born; 36 year old man, moving back one parents. Divorced parents, mind you; deciding move will, course, whole new category issues.

Worth noting: Genesis II around since even long SARS. new, organization sort thing.   Reported misinformation Okay, someone posted article it. Apparently drop SC, areas mask mandate. 

[Here article Forbes Insanity thing expecting different results‚Äù- Albert Einstein Well Trump Sisyphus followers get boulder thing. 

Typical rich guy, supposedly richer rich everybody else pays price. good run new cases mean keep pace cut world forever. 

Eventually coronavirus find way in. Compared UK, Italy, Spain success story importantly result shows lock downs mask wearing dubious effect. way they're going insist gatherings 10 people banned now, send children back school, masks required! churches exempt, too, COVID dare infect people church! Unfortunately, common sense common anymore *If* good chunk people immune via either natural immunity acquired exposure, that's huge chunk potential candidates spreading upcoming colder weather, hopefully bad maybe, maybe, keep current low level.  Hopefully. hallway viral alright I'd say we're certainly heading direction useful get cases dispatched also think case even clearer today 3 months ago effects children less flu--which shut schools for--and political decision open schools bad one. 

I surprised Lina Hidalgo Mayor Turner ignoring CDC's advice matter, guess wrong predicting they'd make right decision. Can't even begin imagine feels like parent send kids school worry end sick covid worse family around kids getting it. Jesus id probably homeschool come kind injury disease keep going.  true all. isnt Sweden seeing child deaths? living life nearly normal   source Trump fatality rate? Well obvious maybe say first place would never situation... pandemic clearly illustrates people lack common sense. want sensational quotes Donald Trump's man. Apathy almost worse. No. get back grocery store. also medical condition requires shoes home walk. They're never gonna fucking learn ""Lockdown"" suggestion point, thing that's changed businesses allowed open. Nothing enforced. It‚Äôs low. work asbestos removal we‚Äôre required 4 air changes per hour. McConnell deal House provide additional stimulus... I‚Äôm convinced schools even close, mush less let students know cases. I‚Äôm opinion let select people know act everything‚Äôs fine. Give kids protest sign covid stay away *cries American* 

I remember cases nothing done ""it disappear."" Yes. dont believe science says schools safe?  people STILL think measures implemented end March time stop entire population exposed. understand anyone think that. horrified much worse covid winter. really honestly would rather get right don‚Äôt get winter. Cause g-d knows we‚Äôre track get covid long vaccine Risking life serve bloomin onion. issue people think reopening local economies, business operations economics fail understand economics behavior entities controlled people market, magical cycle money going firms customers. keep forgetting *have economy* end this, preserve firms, composed people, customers, either people (single customers) firms (again, composed people). Without people, there's market cheeseburgers jobs, business fails. Enough failures, lose economy.

I even like considering way described it, that's economy operates. still good within framework somebody's got willing front cash keep staff safe. Nobody, general, seems willing to, fighting save money they're cyclically losing hemorrhage customers employees investing workers. Wtf possible license plate arent linked you.

Anyway, again..I'm going teacher Sweden saying.

 way I'm also arguing measures taken mentioned effect .

 interesting article countries suffered countries better argued vitamin supplementation major factor too. Swedes supplement vitamin thinking countries?

 article said ironically people areas sun often lower levels heat (they stay inside!) people cooler regions end better vitamin supplement. found pretty interesting. know Sweden list. Impeach Bill Gates!!!!!!!!!  sound reason that. Yet. would freak time friend friend got sick something, would hell crazy fall. Thanks. really amazing May went 250 230 eating well running everyday (went unable run 3 minutes running 5k daily). heat summer bad diet choices slowed June &amp; July far August, gain much weight (maybe like 4 lbs), I've started running moderating calories past week. Gotta get back self improvement mindset May, I'll get goal Christmas. number patients showing hospitals heart attacks dropped.

The logical explanation people coming ER they're afraid catching staying home symptoms living heart attack (can‚Äôt imagine would large number).

I believe there's published stat heart attack survival without medical intervention showing heart attack symptoms, testing positive Covid, coded Covid hospitalization?

I suppose possible? Right? man literally bullshitting Theatricality deception powerful agents uninitiated... initiated, Bruce? vacation. Get back capitol. Here's works:

The Dems try something;

The Republicans block it:

idiots like you: ""both sides suck!!!"" Things get worse fucking support side trying help. Except dorm bathrooms spread entire floors. PAYING THEM?! wtf? 
If job, would get fired literally nothing. Depends live. live option online correspondence homeschool. families don‚Äôt parent available day homeschool former probably popular. Yes. I'm almost always 97.2. temp elevates 99's, may ""fever"" know temp elevated may mean something. straw man argument. 

You know means. Man. misread statement entire opposite: ""Are people think two viruses once?"". reading comments thinking ""what even happening?""

I finally reread comment well again. little horse? hardly knew her! Boom! Sweden one highest COVID-19 fatality rates planet.

That simply fact. 

That grim outcome predicted predictions came true.

Your denials absurd, taken seriously .  buy it. Sweden nothing contain spread disease already case numbers CFR dropped rapidly.  type shit cable technicians deal insane. remember call one. told embarrassed house dirty. basket clothes living room. told houses dog shit over. Houses felt like breathe 15 cats pissing over. Garbage everywhere. Shit straight hoarders. FUCK AMERICA?

American here. find asking every day. know don‚Äôt test anybody can‚Äôt hit 25% one posts.

Several different Chinese sources refer ""contaminated environment"" aka frozen contaminated water, aka contaminated ice. refer aerosol contamination contaminated frozen water aerosolized powder . . .

I may called snow.

If throw water front fan cold produce snow.  even freezing, there's something movement air properties water. type physics air density used trick generating snow boiling water throwing sub 30c air. powder created fine blows away.

Yes, contaminant Chinese found exterior packaging inside cold storage container. easy ""declining cases"" drastically reduce testing. Trump's magical plan beat coronavirus finally worked. I'll share that, thank you. Speak yourself. job locations 2 completely close bc workers walked due safety concerns. Phew! need hope 2020! Latin American tell shit happens blink eye conditions right conditions right.

I think Trump stay office loses did? Boom. Instant dictator. would find fact secure support armed forces behind scenes. armed forces beefed Blackwater. get people like this? 

Unfortunately, can‚Äôt. lot people right deep denial delusion, point can‚Äôt reach logic reasoning. everything can, schools reopen live, they‚Äôll find wasted money nothing inevitability close within week.  Thanks response... they're going wear masks cancelling reception piece, that's something. wish doctor would acknowledged symptoms certainly present cases Covid. Seems little nuts decisively say otherwise, know. fight without union.

Get one two representives employed together.

Then put room together representive CEO VP, company.

Then put third party member room legal guidence (usually someone thats payd workers), knowlege work related quotas, (like many XXXX produced last year, many XXXX sold year)

Then coffee/tea pastries talk out. next 12 months pay benifits decided meeting.

It sounds crazy know, thats im 20 years. It‚Äôs fucking mask. It‚Äôs hard favor write ‚Äúwhatabout whatabout whatabout???‚Äù piece paper... sound like awful person... yikes... fuck bitter about? wronged Dems pass bills help people, that's enough get passed int Senate. 

But passing M4A bill get passed Senate deal breaker? 

Are fucking kidding me? ANYTHING maintain ""both sides suck"" bullshit, right? temperature checks bothered along. hurt anything take temps people sick without fever. I've really, really sick temp go 99.6. go solely temp, they're missing boat. false sense security. path national strategy aquintances already saying getting vaccinated vaccine contain ""alluminium MSG"" similar BS... No. 

Those models based around fact tiny percentage people cause new infections. Superspreader events virus spreads. idiot getting flu vaccine last year. making mistake again. get one soon can. know comment sounds like uber-liberal knee jerk accusation, love shooting sports family live heart Trumplandia. crowd run with. act. change subject get like this. ""How Football Team, huh?""

We hate football. I've ever paid flu vaccine America $15 got college campus take insurance otherwise would free. ""herd immunity"" kicked early Sweden? Peru likley double Swedens death rate
 Belgium also much higher.

The reason Sweden seeing decrease summer. country fucking dies around 3 months every year. anyway. Da flu way less deadly Great cut unemployment benefits sending millions search nonexistent jobs. don‚Äôt know anyone else constant gloom back mind world ending nothing stop it. 

I know help not, 100% feel this, time. like background buzz anxiety, drains energy. Everyday wake go work (retail, open state) thinking pointless is, farce existence become, surely everything going collapse pointless. let's say accept claims post face value. solution isnt stop checks, tell people tests foolproof. businesses still enforce distance guidelines masks within premise even scanning them.  

but going back post, support people false understanding temperature reliable indicator 

what % ""most""? find study estimates % people false precisely bars, restaurants, workplaces, family gatherings largest areas spread. 

the reason bars, restaurants, workplaces, family gatherings large areas spread people inside interacting closely other. evidence suggest high rate spread bars/restaurants/workplaces/familygatherings anything temperature scans? earliest release best release! Let's pull through, boys! I'm game this. A. U.K. way better. Much evidence.
B. dyspraxia autism. yes literacy issues Grace I'm lucky live 2 minutes away polling place. Also actual democracy, people feel ""lucky"" live close enough go vote. beat it. debunked yourself. Good. Thank you.

Oh, go recommendations. They're going again, would Villanova even pretend there's chance won't? Reading doom gloom, try stay hopeful, really resonated me. feel like really grew person September last year February year. finding easier talk people, felt making genuine connections, could see obvious improvements life, great 20 odd years feeling like loner, loser, outcast. March comes along, everyone shelters in, suddenly I'm wondering I'm truly going able meet new people, practice social skills more. feel like past couple months led develop bad habits that'd working hard get rid of, feel anxiety levels rising. 

I feel brother, alone here, get better dont worry. Yeah things seem bleek moment, we'll get it, like human race always manages do. let be. can't run people's lives. people laid buying stuff supposed ""general strike""? Congratulations. That's small feat. name calling seems less effective 3rd 4th time. Expand vocabulary bit, spice something new. Breaks fucking heart. I‚Äôve cooking gentlemen across street me. lives alone haven‚Äôt seen new car pull months.  Yes! Even election changes party charge, next year time COVID situation much improved, still shaken fragile crisis revealed US government be, many problems nation (healthcare, policing, social safety net, employment practices). want live society knows come together solve big problems. Instead feel like slipping away first-world standards. Would explain tested positive antibodies two tests post 3+ month(5 months case) mark, tested positive 3 antibodies tests took. [insert horse joke] assumptions scenario accurate, assuming live US: 1) mask wearing, 2) social distancing. 

. evidence yet. We‚Äôre getting started. I've seen too.
I 2 FB friends ( old classmates)who nurses posting memes railing shutdowns mask mandates 
Also, went dentist month ago secretary wearing mask, chairs socially distanced waiting room(where masks required) dentist mask talked me(before examining teeth) dental hygienist trying make conversation cleaning teeth said, ""I think really need get back normal""

I feel like I'm stuck episode Twilight Zone. Like sometimes think myself, ""am actually crazy one here?"" always was, pretense removed now. lack leadership created much unnecessary chaos.

It's Trump way None said nullifies statement speaks confidence place finding. 

In science still stronger statement nullification evidence. Relevant *The Atlantic* article:

Ja built hospitals&lt; tons little individual rooms. remained unused, infected seniors kept healthy ones. makes sense get maybe worried mom depressed? maybe normal thing cart back home rather bitching lockdown.

Unfortunately work travel/tourism tour director lockdowns mean unemployed move apartment reduce costs. going move cousin. option bring mom in.

I realize New York bad. guys also massive seniors homes deaths (quick check = 6500) .. well field hospitals built, dismantled without treating single patient. seems bit fucked, know? get that. mean felt positive us humans before. longer he's seen stupidity go figure he's getting far pessimistic. [Even mild obesity huge risk factor social safety net strong enough US catch people. lot people hit rock bottom. things need adjust sure honestly say aside wearing mask I'm indoors public generally keep distance people know, life pretty much back normal. Bars, restaurants, movie theaters, retail stores... everything open restrictions minimal. maybe 3 4 deaths per week ~100 new cases per day, 8.5 million people. testing 15-17k per day, 24h turnaround time. numbers far worse one point got control. Oh shit. second time noticed post. realized read wrong first time. thought said 2020. FUCVK! People argue time things black white, times grey. B? Well sometimes C sometimes senate did. House passed bill back May. Title misleading, suggestion tucked larger press releases unsupported kind data. *Requiem Dream music plays* snow, mean debris like dust packaging? would lot contaminated surfaces repeatedly abraded, aerosolized inhaled workers also long exposure time plausible.

Maybe that‚Äôs eating bats? said proper precautions taken perfectly followed it'd safe so. basically safe so. sure, keep lying. It‚Äôs infuriating someone living California.

My governor fine job handling pandemic, problem governor doesn‚Äôt reach influence president. 

He‚Äôs fought sheriffs mask ordinances, DT turned political issue. It‚Äôs infuriating.  vaccines. Right now. produce neutralizing antibodies humans. They're safe enough phase 3 trials. would epic-nobel prize winning science fiction somehow turned work point. Instead making lot people silent, system making lot people silent. 86milion americans represented crimes geography, gerrymandering. 
Another point is, populated states simply put money federal budget, decide quit that? NY, CA, TX make majority federal budget together. indignantly ignored lessons New York‚Äôs early disaster offer  NZ ‚Äúweak positive‚Äù

They people got weeks test would likely test negative days

We considered low risk transmission 

Could same? pointed out, number correct. Get free college. getting $10 post-school COVID-19 political purely one party decided make political. thing worst Trump lame duck cheats way winning election. like 22 cases reacted immediately stop spread. 

If keep low, like playing game whack-a-mole. deal case pops up. places like US, wide-spread like half moles pop time can't whack all. Well caught them, black.   wont unfortunately do! know hopeless honestly don't. I've seen sparky fires sparky, assumed smart (dry wood aged?) would minimize im depth. Minnesota rarely burn bans. dunno. trends usually start? That's exactly do.

Meanwhile side things government solve everything, shining example can‚Äôt even get basic shit right.

But go on, entrust government responsibilities! could go wrong... what's solution then? letting person die can't afford treatment? before. takes days test actually detect reliably. great. Less traffic. Cooler out. covid free stream consciousness. Stay safe. Thank you. actually disagree lot saying, agree certain overriding sentiment. example, I'm teacher California numbers still fairly high. starting year online. Many teachers district seems think long even single case schools online virus eliminated. effective vaccine takes 6 years get vaccine? virus could take many years peter without effective vaccine. kids supposed online school forever? Imagine half students showing online. means we're ok half kids getting education years years? Especially work low income area education essential helping students get dreams jobs. Like said, I'm glad we're opening yet, positivity rate 1% (like states do) R0 1, would okay attempting open hybrid schedule 50% students campus time sufficient procedures PPE students &amp; teachers. hear teachers district saying ""no that's enough, never safe gone"" true, might 100% safe, point would safe enough comfortable attempting return. online option teachers students scared immuno-comprimised would great too. 

So even though agree woman's overall attitude (I think pandemic sort govt test taking rights free away peanut allergies contagious) think society need start asking answering question end game safe enough start returning parts normal life. impossible fix date US started actually fixing problem yet.

This implies US actually going fix anything. very, clear 30% care entire population dies least would die ""with freedoms/rights."" evidence show T-cell immunity present allows long term protection. Even mild cases. Opening again? expecting different results thing. House dealt it, people Wyoming would far power appointments people California.

In district, quarantine positive test, though go get test symptoms. Though, reflection, tests taking two weeks come back currently, effectively two week quarantine every time child symptoms, stand corrected. described form union, workers simply walk out, ceo one working anymore. workers still get paid though, thru money put said union.

Usually happens would meet day two try again. Mine went away week cases same. thought 4 days exhausted sick vacation woke one morning symptoms felt like heart attack classic symptoms. milder case thank god.

Havent problems since far districts offering options FDOE. case, problem less district Ron DeSantis's Education Commissioner. nursing homes like that. Staff come PPE. ones come found corpses, asked management do, told closet corpses.

Good idea theory, works they‚Äôre capable feeling shame That‚Äôs death rate doesn‚Äôt increase exponentially. also know longer people stay hospitals likely they‚Äôre going die. We‚Äôre starting see rise death rates.

Florida also nothing order slow infection rate, like Texas pass mask mandate they‚Äôre seeing slow down. Good calling name calling crazies are.

There reasons wife looking area world, yeah, we're ready change.

And oh, definitely Northern AZ gets real winters sure, though they've pretty dry comparatively late. However, last year record snowfall Flagstaff 35.9 inches snow 24 hours! pretty neat witness. 

The heat-agression something totally experience.. hate feeling, like fuse cut millimeter. Careful plopping outdoor furniture, though, might get 3rd degree burn metal frame!

All joking aside, Northern AZ amazing forests wilderness (though long they'll last fire fire, I'm sure) AZ best Mexican food country. 

I could go weird state is. experience growing sure. 

You seem like great person, thanks chat - wish best hope able stay safe healthy ride out. Close full I'm boat, graduated debt college early/mid 10's. 

What tell takes achieve this:

- job since legal working age high school
- took almost twice long graduate since hold part-ish time job college. Spent 7 years school (didn't summers since grants/scholarships apply then).
- went local state school big affordable ""big"" state school
- first two-three years spent community college much cheaper.
- get 24 years old qualify Pell Grant covered huge chunk
- lived dirt cheap Midwestern city easy commute classes cheap apartment
- enough support structure family entirely fend myself. cash anything (family pretty broke), helps plenty hand furniture older sister roommate, plus dad's pulled pork whenever got smoker out.
- I've always budget conscious worked way jobs knew paid well per hour school

My sister circumstances pull loans, though relatively small (10k-ish). deny path sacrificed truly great education opportunity cost. Someone traditional 4 year good state school probably bit financially am, even accounting debt. say giving earning potential could little debt possible opened lot options ways. Ended moving California totally change life around get local trappings. kind life changing move possible purely lack debt. bill pay $85/mo car payment, risky moves risky all. age 30 now, earning potential finances certainly worse someone traditional route, gave true freedom flexible take risks, value money. truly say I'm finally point feel like I'm thriving everything coming together. like individually chose though... 

We're born society largely forces us live market instead society. recognize sorts testing methodologies, appear testing symptomatic people (given tiny testing numbers) past days positivity rate seems around 25% tests given? see scar, back car. 99.9 chance survive

Fuck Fauci Market interesting.  5000 PCR tests single case

Yea think covered. case nightclub officials say: follow symptoms there. masks, guest books, tracing app, basically nothing. realize US pays per capita worse healthcare right? Taxing us pay healthcare eliminating need insurance would actually reduce overall cost healthcare per person We‚Äôve situation decades lol enjoyed work home little while. Eventually social isolation hit hard. Things would much different significant friends could socially bubble with.

It starts feel like life hold sports activities used longer taking place significant other. would happily go back work meant social activities everything else used returned. absurd.

The virus going spread. virus. shut kept people indoors 24/7, yes could contained.

But reality. 

Looking someone entity blame. üôÑ üò£ overdramatic statement. teaching possible covid safe method. Look europe, lot countries it. I'm talking primary school though. Teachers big risk obviously stay home. big problem funding replacement.
Off course done lot testing closing school cases.

Not sending children school disaster, parents especially children. world upside can't handle well children. I've hearing 12-18 month timeline best case scenario vaccine, would fall within timeline. Yeah, vocal minority. Meh FrEeDuM !!!! guns  Every man dies, every man truly lives. You, friend, man lives. Man - friend post FB day sending kid back school (6th grade ish?)...she joked (and 100% believe joke) needed space kid. 

I cannot imagine ever saying that...and holy hell...if kid get sick worse...can imagine looking back post like that? Tremendous! Believe me. Well me. calmed down, take virus seriously. family wear masks follow guidelines social distancing. doubt nasty virus. threatening mass apocalyptic doom trying instill fear plain wrong. incite fear, panic sets in, panic sets people forget follow basic rules. feel like def inform population. done without trying cause mass hysteria. also put wall keeps falling cheaped anchored ground deeply enough. sure hope flu CoVid don‚Äôt babies wanna get raptured anyone explain infections projected go fall?

 concern seasonal flu combined coronavirus make illness severe recovery less likely?

 simply people closing windows recirculating air? 

Is coronavirus likely thrive cooler temperatures? (For matter, seasonal flu impacted different temperatures?) so, seeing cases almost every climate?

Those hypotheses based research, come anything conclusive. Exercise, drink water, eat real food, take vitamin B, D, C, get Omega 3. people by-and-large get virus die ones lazy unhealthy. sad truth, take care week week out. mean sympathy them, 90% patient population others see hospitals lazy, unhealthy people take care themselves. 50-75 COVID patients cared last months... ONE single one healthy, normal weight, middle aged young person. EVERY SINGLE ONE unhealthy, ate terrible food, exercise, extremely old... etc
We pandemic laziness lack proper health USA 95% problem.

P.S. already gotten virus, along several front line workers. sucks, saying doesn't, knocks ass 3-6 weeks. Headaches, coughing, congestion, upset belly... relatively healthy body fight win. There's stupid there's southern stupid. I‚Äôm scared Fox box control  even think season read comments -_-;; guy annoying diarrhea Sarcasm folks! said go one two ways. middle. Either nothing happens shitshow. true!! many people think it‚Äôs going hunt something. point would welcome Godzilla. assuming all. simply saying solution alcoholic parents isn‚Äôt keep home parents virtual learning send school coronavirus. doesn‚Äôt address problem all. understand isn‚Äôt ideal solution here, significantly dropped ball. Back March, planning addressing issues go virtual. didn‚Äôt dropped ball. Properly fitting vent, allows germs get world. state governor says wear face covering basically kill grandma. see people surgical masks gaps side, t-shirt type cloth masks, bandannas, things pull neck. medial grade I'm sure. read random controlled scientific studies done including recent ones last 18 months.

This nothing logical thinking know controllable factor pandemic social distancing, done, why, knowingly enforce rules one working better distancing program 2 scientifically proven ineffective virus transmission, harmful wearer many reasons, would that. top uniform diagnostic rules confirming covid 19 numbers constantly misreported changed. news talking second wave, Fauci included, one. Sure covid without doubt much caused improper use face coverings counted covid. Go CDC look definition case. Unless changed last 2 weeks one symptoms 2 symptoms. Ok got stay home get better. many things adding opinion. wish primary doctors article didnt label way said paper compiling whole bunch studies masks, work, ones work best, statistics people wear percentage get sick. 

Look problem people wearing masks, go right ahead. wear science make sense anything Fauci ""currently"" says bad old science. pretty bizarre. Duh-doy. I'm passively suicidal right (lol?) Natural selection work going take generations... somehow keep forgetting election. Meanwhile we've got five years *certain party* fuck us thanked it.

What hell happens Biden inherits fallout Trump's chaos? gonna cope? Sounds like normal life many people. initial thought. 50% people get asymptomatic, passed along one person another slowly three months, there's good statistical odds could burn string asymptomatics finally infected people actually sick.

That said, genetic evidence seems indicate imported, local transmission, maybe not. incessant non-stop arguing vaccine alarmists side effects small number people previous vaccines f ing fake hell. far worst pandemic 100 years, first comparing viruses lifetime. Due circumstances, really truly honestly think vaccine next year likely f over, argue properly stop fear mongering possible hidden bogeymen vaccines damn well know consequences actually catching actual virus waaaaay likely cause way unpleasant effects. Argue properly tell people flat ugly facts: either take vaccine, bank risk catching actual virus, else move Siberia away people, else live mask rest lives. new H1N1 virus pigs going around can‚Äôt understand flaw applying (1-(1/R0)) real world you‚Äôre lost cause. 

[And wouldn‚Äôt bring peer review foolproof defense feel like may misunderstood time. modern knowledge seeing people almost symptoms, even asymptomatic, week two later enter multi-organ failure. could similar events mostly reported, second wave, much larger, causing them.

Alternatively could mutated, that‚Äôs thoughts, scientist anything.

I add also, I‚Äôve never heard second wave represented mutation Spanish flu, comments represent opinion comment above.

No thanks.  Seriously.. That's response?? American exceptionalism US fucked. Congrats perpetuating stereotypes. Merely idea live like another 1.5 years makes want check right honest Nothing go wrong one sure. go Articles effort. really luck, stupidity. Proof positive defunding education negative consequences future generations. folks saying probably first wave see reduced funding, imaging much worse get. advertise free - qualify fact ""most"" insurances. turns ""most"" insurances usually rules HMO plans. Harsh truth: 

Few places 'West' handled outbreak well... 


We accept there's lots fault preexisting behavior facilitated first outbreaks.

The West lot less rigorously regulated East Asia, never got groove wearing masks, internalized beliefs supporting largely uninhibited free trade, mass travel, immigration tourism. None traits help pandemic. 

But excuse utterly deplorable failure USA adjust accordingly 5 months. Believe me, live Texas finding people even taking seriously challenge. Thankfully I'm local dad's group Facebook wife local mom's group. Maybe try route already might help connect like-minded families. know scroll past things agree think people stupid ahead time worth try argue people whose minds made up. Depressed? allowed work home first time professional life woke feeling positive. 

Unfortunately back work office last three weeks absolutely terrible. 

I guess everyone different though perfectly fine waking spending 9 hours making money  pajamas. 

My chronic depression lifted work home first time adult life. back vengeance I'm on-site again. mean obviously /s talking like Donald Trump, saying Trump said months summer future tense. 

I kind hate /s thing guess reached point possible Trumper might actually live past kind alternate reality timeline. Sad! 

Very Sad!! happen Altered Carbon? husband wife kill arena trying get better life kids... Present 1 4 Dr's fear windows. fed complete incompetency many parts government, city, state federal. fuck happened many people plain don‚Äôt give damn people they‚Äôre supposed represent? effects quarantine going worse virus.

No, aren't. effects America's failure respond consequences quarantine effectively might worse virus. easily counter, example, mass unemployment, providing stimulus checks, minimize effects depression expanding access mental health resources. choices made hold reins power, whereas physical effects virus not. would mean 0.2% population dead, country pass 0.1% San Marino. Toronto resident welcome back pandemic subsides. then, stay safe healthy! can‚Äôt speak states mask wearing nearly universal Phoenix last month observations. whole, everyone seems conscious mask wearing social distancing. difference flu nearly contagious covid19 getting normally ok. pay $~45 mine whenever dont insurance, $10 do.   safe way handle never go outside again. *raises hand* didn‚Äôt get takeout months pandemic became clear risk spread surfaces food minimal. 


I would totally understand someone feeling comfortable even today. That‚Äôs really meant one would care, one would argue it. thing take issue trying justify getting rid outdoor dining logic doesn‚Äôt add sidestepping trying change argument. wasn‚Äôt even going go actual realities risk transmission, said made zero sense. Like said before, people diet go back old habits, gain old weight back. (Most) People change lifestyle dietary behavior, lose weight.

I need write books, others done much better job ever will.

Go check Dr McDougall, Dr. Neal Barnard Dr. Greger. (they lot youtube videos also documentaries like Forks Knives, Health etc.)

They advocate whole foods plant based lifestyle, done studies written books topic.

You need cut certain foods unhealthy also let gain weight easily. example dairy products, sugar, white flower, meat (or reduce meat massively) oils. things unhealthy let gain weight various reasons prevent weight loss.

Cook meals lots vegetable, starchy foods like rice, potatoes, beans etc. Go check videos. almost stuff free want sell anything.

Its far easiest way lose maintain weight, restrict calories eat full, foods low calories high nutrients. Dr. McDougall also forum, success stories kinds problems, including weight loss Nah. american. reason worded weirdly didnt want say America.

I know countries opening schools well got loan reopen backs servers didn‚Äôt wanna lose UE stuck without job. Restaurants forced staff back special kind evil hope fail. 
I‚Äôm supporting ones strove make safe open didn‚Äôt open all.  already crashing here. They're keeping pretend-afloat massive cash injections, malreporting, chicanery sleight hand. 
 
Just things *look* okay election over. we'll get real bad things are. Oh certainly, I'm sure bad now, see rise confrontations, violence, etc. lot people deal loss loved ones, homes/livelihoods/jobs, well issues, can't imagine bad be. mention, exactly handle mental health well first place either.

It'll interesting seeing 20 years line, remembered/written down. truly wonder doctors nurses say rest nation pre-martyring sacrificing doctors nurses lives (without permission/without agreeing it, less) bunch idiots refuse safety health measures damn pandemic.  


I mean, one thing actually volunteer something may cause death, whole 'nother ball game *someone else volunteers it.* many mentioned, seriously doubt doctors nurses *looking* martyr everyone else, whether we're middle pandemic! Honestly life savings market depleted things would even worse right nothing America though. 
Every country limited number hospital beds. theyre full, people would ""compete"" them.

Thats logic.  maybe fall means autumn case. second thought let‚Äôs go loony interpretation also gasoline 1970 US. 17 month old.  media. There's lot theories impact leaded removed gasoline US 1970. Except president literally politicized issue mask wearing early on, said deep state symbol him.  year flew two take entire Walmart aisle! so, wrong. Genetics socioeconomic status play HUGE role. interested reading genetics, look guy's work....  ignorance wearing correct mask infect others?

What price think would pay less self centered working protect myself?


Seriously, even explain nonsense? would harm come wearing correct mask also protects others vs incorrect one protects myself? really think defend anything say deftly proven thus far. go blaming human race. appears strictly conservative problem. spanked Poor Dr. Fauci. preaching deaf ear. face really spells dumbass, thats much support state. can't wash hands eating?

We much countries politicians planet constantly know what's what. 

Give us information please.  good scientific study should. Since specifically design study test that, want say something test conclusive. data obviously strongly suggested likely, put disclaimer different, absolute.

Do study cultured viruses real world conditions? I'd love read one counterpoint papers showing opposite... clean shit school keep bringing students breath literally fucked respect sentiment, seems important point since lot people literally get college degrees without actually learning Socialism is: that's Socialism. Person kids here. get handle virus, we're going work go to. Making bad decisions perpetuate pandemic hurts economy more. That's ""home schooling"" for! concerned stopping coronavirus living life. vaccine tested here? China one? Oxford one? Moderna? **bEtTeR wOrLd** Literally every single one events deeply political. Depression exacerbated Hoover administration's unwillingness interfere (collapsing) free market, programs created response Depression (at least ones survived modern day) transformed United States something resembling civilized country. Opposition fascism also obviously political, even setting aside, way war prosecuted influenced impending political conflict emerging superpower. 9/11, hoooo boy. Domestic surveillance, Iraq War, Guantanamo Bay, security theater, ~~the Committee State Security~~ mean ~~the Protection Squadron~~ mean Homeland Security, just... POLITICAL SHIT. understand pretending politics part job, full shit.  think good idea US pandemic. Reading people left homes since March heartbreaking. reaction towards how... vulgar heaters seem normal winter situation. Airplanes understand carry HEPA filters. filters catch particles 3 virus 1 micron. So, wrong.

IIRC virus small spreads aerosol droplets largers get caught HEPA filters Frankly, I'm shocked telling people repeatedly stay hell home, may end 2021, nobody needs go restaurant, etc... causing increase depression feelings isolation. /s sounds like good idea. think I‚Äôll that. accurately described health state Americans complete joke herd immunity? Lol üòÇ That's problem. politicians power willing sacrifice lives constituents get re-elected guaranteeing outcome. Even symptomatic, likely taking something relief like FEVER REDUCER (motrin tylenol).

Goodbye high school college sports generation! 12 becomes 24 24 becomes half year. Ask rest world cant really remember flying like 9/11 though know flied least times before. 10 9/11 occurred. point don‚Äôt believe anything White House says. Michigan/Detroit executive order issued nurses undergo racial bias training get tested see retain information racial bias.

Because ""the nurses' fault"" majority dead minorities. lack vitamin D, poverty, diet, overweight, diabetes, use public transportation.

I've asked anyone cite one example racist nurse downtown Detroit directly responsible 1 death via intentional neglect outright bad racist treatment patient. 

None cited. Anyone heard mad cow disease? Infected beef proteins turned prions- insoluble proteins deposit brain cause dementia basically go crazy.. turn zombies!! idea could make happen though (naturally abuse employee end well).

Universal healthcare stronger workers rights like guaranteed numbers sick days vacation days year. Plenty countries it, solved problem already. Um, no.

It mix apathy, identity based racist, supremacist notions disinformation, full stop.

Ever since Southern Strategy + implementation right wing media via Roger Ailes, GOP moved Overton window right leading national disinformation campaign literally allowed viewers Faux News, etc brainwash themselves.

Throw horrifying ideals left Civil War, particularly South - Jim Crow, segregation, etc - system racism exists institutions systemically still day.

And let‚Äôs clear - US paragon education (if white) decades also competitive across board sports, too. both. 

You wrong say education sucks. one worst developed countries. However, bc good spirts doesn‚Äôt mean that‚Äôs education faltering.

Education faltering bc GOP, full stop. gutted public education every turn hellbent privatize every school profit. 

I realize said lived another country, guess susceptible disinformation way, WAY off. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre smart bc sports‚Äù cliche line could think honestly shows ignorance Poles Americans, least comes comically uninformed here. 

I would suggest asking questions and/or reading topic don‚Äôt know anything offering opinion said subject. seriousness seems doctors around world doctors Russia quite concerned this. Everyone masks least. would think ikea would manditory mask speaking quarantine United States statement false.

Every western nation done far superior job Covid quarantine leading fewer illnesses deaths. 

Meanwhile United States tens millions work, kids school, swimming Covid. six month shit Federal leadership. 

So take Vitamin D, wear mask, wash hands, stop watching Fox News. Yes, second-order effect.

Most people incorrectly believe sports generate enough revenue cover athletic department PLUS cover regular, costs. never do; most, athletics able cover budget. running higher norm, speak up. Choose self-isolate suspect anything abnormal. Given work environment, probably temperature checks even leave home. Imagine would feel got others sick, died. Bro almost every democratic senator behind war. Try Yes, circumcise trunks elephants make attractive. Source? Sounds interesting stand, united fall. Maybe burned low hanging fruit, nursing homes.

Oh god, I'll take loneliness world stuck home bored kid god forbid group them. sister wants kids go school.....Fuck Yeah, trickle phenomena pretty clear easy observe. Trump loving laws would basically parrot whatever saying virus time. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs big deal.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt go away warm summer weather.‚Äù

And, seen Trump supporting governors altered rhetoric actions line Trump saying week two before.

I place blame squarely admin. good leader could used challenge unite us even spite independent attitude. It‚Äôs done good leadership many times past. article mentions social distancing mask-wearing could also help lower cases flu cold.

I mean, 100% reduce cases. proven already countries enacted measures flu season due COVID. flu COVID nearly virus perspective they're spread, COVID spreads easily hosts debilitated illness immediately flu. Move herpes! Corona new STD completely agree  Global pandemic: ""I'm U.S. care?""

New York / California / Washington pandemic: ""I'm southern/central states care?""

Southern/Bible belt pandemic: ""I'm frontline worker/I'm old, care?""

Mom/dad/brother/sister/son/daughter dies: ""We could do."" took long? test 1% false negative rate likely due missing cases using single negative test instead two negative &amp; independent tests: .01*5000=50  effective, loosening results resurgence. know virus, effectively make mitigation measures make sense effective resurgence overload hospitals, main goal. mitigation measures? Effective mask mandates, outdoor dining only, bar restrictions, effective contact tracing isolation combined quick lots testing isolate hot spots keep positivity rate 5 percent. 

We started see resurgence Anchorage, Alaska mask mandate municipality implemented first, outdoor dining restaurants bar closures except takeout. going cases hospitals still good shape, although hospitalizations bit. It'll fine, long there's plenty polic... Oh. given enough time even someone getting pinched stop giving shit theyre pinched also back January February, far tell (based godawful symptoms shortness breath chest pain). I'm sure impacted already-receding hairline, though; think that's consistent.

But real reason responding directly post is, read CDC saying three-month window immunity person Covid. thought getting second time frankly terrifies me, especially given new information we've learned virus since start year (e.g. severe damage organs). Get rid incumbents- them. . could forget that! government sharing weed. know whether racist. Maybe is. government strongly recommend quarantine provide facilities, food, medical care people will. NZ cases would really worth doing. Paying lost wages, etc.

I'm sure feel like treated differently. Maybe are. would hope people would quarantine community. Native people gotten hit hard introduced diseases would awful see outbreak population. 

Maybe discussion do. Everyone goals protecting country.

I wish people country would consider quarantining away family given resources so. Stop making much sense around here. Groupthink standard üòÇ Pennsylvania here. Every day shutdown saw same, more, number cars road normal day going work. went memorial day (because work wastewater plant) saw 4 cars whole way in. 4. work holidays, essential. expecting every day shutdown went holiday. Pissed off. Baaahahaha. sure funny way say, ""I completely wrong spreading misinformation.""

Seek help, friendo. Actually common feeling. bought bike months back get house safely. rides night wonderful. also started going parks read listen podcasts. first, great therapy.

But I'm seeing folks relax protocol seems like America never get hump. Obviously, Biden winning November provides hope. I'm reading hijinx committed Trump regard post service, anxious.

The decline civility gets depressed. I'm genuinely concerned America might recover wounds inflicted Trump.

Stay strong, friend.  don‚Äôt disagree spare thought us elders, - lose job I‚Äôll dig 401k won‚Äôt many years build back up. actually don‚Äôt clinical data support conclusion one way another, CDC operating narrative data crisis. senate house pass bill Trump sign. He‚Äôs already going win November directly refusing sign relief bill right 30m Americans would end presidency. course not. doesn‚Äôt contradict anything said. live South East Michigan already signed 10 year old son year online school. two options in-person classes 2 days week in-person 3 days distance learning. drawback year online classes seems live lessons teachers; instead I'll teach child myself. takes protect son that's we'll do. certain schools open early September closed within days parents school district asking could happened. Yep, feel like I've really understood hell happening country good, oh, four years now... lot gets posted preprint peer review journal publishing. roughly 60% could disproven. 1970? phase-out leaded gasoline end NY, can't go gym, Laser tag Bowling fine entirely. It‚Äôs possible viable always oh friend, will. Yeah one says that. think ever even asked audience actually believe. Free Canada. long go doctor. know..It's like testing reddit waters. people reddit towards one side opinion versus another..so make fun Fauci's pitch baseball game, every subreddit reacts negatively. say going Cabo.

 Versus people reddit interact daily quarantining, still going colorado mexico vacation sporadically. *Fuck Dude, let‚Äôs go bowling* No, that's Pok√©mon think egregious cunt, fucking loathe BOLD prediction worst year past 50 years. /s people expecting northeast get bad fall? I'm PA find hard believe things going get significantly worse fall precautions place. testing still room improvement, heard anyone \*not\* able get test.

When people say ""this worst fall US history"" thinking northeast? thinking places virus already spreading like crazy? models looking really show much uptick northeastern states show TX, FL, etc. really ramping deaths/cases. Fair enough, still think played role favorite see people wearing mask covering mouth nose. Drives nuts. CDC director shut hell up. We're dog fucking tired doom gloom rhetoric. stop. Yeah. sometimes kids sick. I'll swap every 2 hours. lol, WW2 political, moment ended US got Cold War WW2 ally Russia. No, read that. That's reiterating one talking it, point making first sentence well. Again, false. talked about. gotcha, gotta read could still spread others. Wear mask stay home! blatantly false.

3M manufactures line medical grade masks specifically use paramedics researchers protect disease spread, valves WITHOUT. reason take shoes getting airplane. gives illusion something proactive pandemic making everyone go crazy swear...

These poor kids teachers staff risk lives why? county level Republican wants tow party line put crazy cap like 25% positive virus... really makes wonder going happen county level politicians finally whole thing behind us. going see Democrat led committee possibly prosecuting people horrible decision-making? ... they??? hope so! People give SHIT hits close home.

fact.

When grandpa dad wifey best friend girlfriend dies? circle wagons.... Huh, that‚Äôs really interesting consequence COVID don‚Äôt think anyone would seen coming I‚Äôm 33 gotten flu shot every year long remember never paid one. work wastewater plant previously company water testing. TON tests need done drinking water. tests done 4 quarters year good couple years numbers good, grand more. (We small water provider literally provided hundred homes test SOC's think trouble coming money it) weekly coliform tests, TTHM HAA5's, chlorine residuals, metals. huge list. chemicals, someone else said, employees, lines, equipment go fix lines break, testings supplies materials. mention always upgrades needed pretty much time. get one part upgraded something else need done. lot goes people realize. regulations ever get stricter. Yea kind bummer considering EMS lucky get 15$/hr stuck back coughing, vomiting covid+ patient however long tight quarters poor air circulation. meanwhile cocksuckers making money hand fist risk.  guys really want open border Canada anytime soon you? need combination field hospital / classroom. many cases declare red zone? precisely point? 

People take precautions would otherwise, plus temperature checks. 10% covid positive people get filtered temperature checks, that's added value. AGREE ...This learning process .....since forgot last pandemic like repeat history. last time United States ever truly unified 9/11.... white black brothers sisters, strong determination. 20 yrs almost endless war middle east endless race baiting media politicians led now. distrust government led many people think covid national conspiracy. blame game needs stop Republicans democrats failed jobs. United States proud nation full diverse people, time come gone laughing stock world. cold civil war right red vs blue also dont wanna get shot racist people kinds. thought covid flu, whatever fits narrative fuckface. thing man. End February, take 2-3 days work. 102-103 degree fever, cough, felt achey, runny nose etc. went urgent care tested flu strep, negative. sent home cough medicine. Finally got week roughly. Fever stayed 3-4 days.

I noticed though month 2 later seemed like noticing hair falling out. lot hair, noticed running hands hair shower whatever would see extra strands.

I chalked extra stress working home 3 kinds 5. chest x-ray blood work done recently around time normal figured stress + getting older, would interesting actually covid. people keep fucking us. Devos heinous fucking CUNT There's lag get infected test positive, like 5 days quite possible test come back negative virus.

Also test's fool-proof, certainly possible false negative Ok, anything add rest comment interested things completely negative about? looking comment history raging boner hating UK reason imagine ignore anything can't directly hate on.

While we're it, got source UK first world country greatest underestimate death toll? given practically country idea actual numbers deaths caused. could ever know completely beyond me. surreal meeting someone US believe evolution believes Mendelian inheritance (if name). Guess happens Mendelian inheritance differential survival rates time? people coming over? Honestly, would scared 50 people gathering even outside. recently family gathering, luckily family small like 10 people less (also northeast). though communities literally community transmission right now, places widespread community transmission. like living two different worlds.

In part PA, things somewhat back normal outside indoor dining. People wear masks guess considered ""normal"" stores open stuff like that. low new cases. US considered 'flawed democracy' even Commander Chief tried steal 2020 election keep prison.

Did ever think would get point sentence would uttered? agree busiest summer they've ever seen.

This summer like 4th July every single day :( WW2 Americans united kill German Japaneses

With 911 Americans united kill people Middle East

And Corona Americans united kill elderly.

Seems pretty consistent me. politicians make hundreds thousands, millions, rest America left ‚Äújust figure out‚Äù. Nope. slightest.  Bernie lead polling better others despite media black out/almost smear campaign representative James Clyburn primary candidates dropped endorsed biden time right south Carolina primary. media point hammered Biden presumptive nominee even though SC 1st primary won. annoys implies first state biden pretty much determined course election despite majority country yet chance vote. Overall believe things would played lot differently primary elections scattered corporate media less power arbitrarily black candidate. im expert elections perspective following primaries closely keeping track polling fundraising.

Edit add lot state primaries delayed Coronavirus, incidentally Bernies initiatives popular point one 1st senators address public plan stimulus package. Hmm balls hairier ever covid. Honestly, keep saying depression going kill COVID-19.

I‚Äôm taking quarantine seriously. I‚Äôve gone handful times since March. I‚Äôm home three small children it‚Äôs getting me. I‚Äôve suicidal before; don‚Äôt want happen again.

Started therapy last week antidepressants couple days ago. heard woman radio say, ""I trust kids wear masks socially distance"" justification sending back.

Well, reading flu shot recently, help heart problems brought flu, converted. 

If going selfish, think like this: want live, develop heart problems flu, get vaccine.

This anyone paying attention daily numbers wrong. Look positive rate real insight. Engineer let explain this. two people wear masks close together long enough, 100% chance one person disease second get it.

If sick person wears mask there's 30% chance transfer. social distance there's 50% chance.

If social distance sick person wears mask chance goes 15% (30% x 50%). healthy person wears mask 70% chance. Apply three probability 10.5%. 

Applying reductions reduces R0 disease. Get transmission rate low enough disease dies out. Numerous countries proven real life. theory, fact.

[Disclaimer Two things America. Huh, husband literally things still graduated student loan debt. Like, literally them‚Äîworked high school, worked ‚Äúpart tims‚Äù (35 hours week) college (also CC lower cost transferred), took longer graduate it, got Pell grants could... 

What financial aid situation like? husband didn‚Äôt get much first dad made much money, even though husband didn‚Äôt get financial help him. state school (again, CC transferring in) also tried kick classes *in last semester* taken long get (again, due work school time) ran financial aid demanded pay 1k pocket cover last semester. (Luckily family able help out.) 

He also wasn‚Äôt Midwest, went school around grew up. (Which, know, went anywhere else would pay state tuition.)

So, basically, literally still student loan debt. I‚Äôm glad worked (really, am, debt-free great thing), again, really isn‚Äôt ‚Äúgolden path‚Äù days. work hard can, still literally enough. Video definitely giving weird feelings. really disgusting dangerous unacceptable bit worried woman video possibly becoming victim mob justice something malicious. former smoker, cigarettes caused untold amount damage gums teeth. finally quit smoking, began brushing 2x/day, flossing using waterpik. gums bleed anymore, oral health helped overall health improve well. also vit deficiency due autoimmune disease (I believe due that). take multi vitamin along extra vit d. things I've improve overall health, COVID. habits need work improve health, I'm that, albeit slowly.

You asserted statement, right front page wiki article incorrect. You‚Äôre clearly far element talking stuff. Oh sweet summer children..... knew exactly unhealthy average, know full well we're another 50-100k deaths come cold flu season. number human planets who'd die first sign disease incredible. We're make 150k look like rounding error ir is..... imagine one people saying ""no one knew would bad"". North remembers. South, hand, kind shrugged went back beach. 6. People can‚Äôt get surgeries due hospitals jam packed COVID patients
(Like myself) really great example Dunning Krueger effect. You‚Äôre unaware ignorance, think you‚Äôre right. 


Do really think epidemiology/virology lab work looking Petri dish microscope? Determining every behavioral aspect brand new virus simple? 


I feel like you‚Äôre type person take car mechanic tell ‚ÄúHey car won‚Äôt start. Get wrench tighten bolts something. It‚Äôs fucking difficult.‚Äù good thing nothing important happening right President time fix shower heads. Gam Gam went partied Woodstock 1968 Hong Kong flu appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* America takes nothing serious except stock market......and guns. could care less populace. look elected leader. Stairs. I'm afraid stairs. True COVID similar Flu mutates. Then, like flu, vaccine probably match exactly, causing less, still some, immunity bad, scrolled it.

Yeah, I'm worried myself. Memphis Shelby County leadership keep shitting bed, wanted give smallest amount kudos virtual school decision. economy dead. depression. 30 million people lost health insurance 40 million risk evicted. person replying obviously talking spread virus, symptoms prognosis.

Yes ISIS specific enemy, imperialism humanity enemy. *ANYTHING* profit. Even means ignoring stuff talking happening nations profitable us. Like china. know there's atrocities happening *could* stop. we're choosing *money*. No, schools reopened takes couple weeks see spike -- surge still coming even worse. don‚Äôt think life minimal human contact life worth living. 

I think, get reasonable level risk, willing take risk so. Others aren‚Äôt, wont. **I saying currently reasonable level risk**. saying 50-60% effective vaccine delivered large scale, might be.

The argument ‚Äúwhy others right pass don‚Äôt control it‚Äù straw man argument. don‚Äôt want get it, don‚Äôt go engage activities might lead risk. exactly want everyone do. hybrid solutions :

  - major grocery stores ‚Äúlimited capacity / mask Tuesday/Thursdays‚Äù. need groceries, aren‚Äôt comfortable things going back normal, go tuesdays thursdays. 

  - grocery delivery services becoming every popular 


You totally live way want everyone else live! this, make sure minimize risk getting virus. can‚Äôt stare window remaining 90% population comfortable living virus say ‚ÄúI wish everyone would live like me, make comfortable‚Äù.

Sure ""pulled together"", pulled together become nationalistic, warmongering cowards. embarrassed, proud, acted time. Except without cheap oil/coal. 800 per 100,000 277 per 100,000 respectively We'll vaccine eight months, yeah, sufficient syringes vials actually use it. bet help supposedly 'free' tests far often 'not free' stupidly costly. think anything guaranteed disease. Maybe not, though suppose resign English department head give back degrees language then. someone‚Äôs strict descriptivist doesn‚Äôt mean don‚Äôt understand language. Yea... WW2 different beast. Yes attacked, country unify fighting one common enemy. think ideal data collection methodology question. herd immunity culling back May literally nothing OK NPR scientific source. first scientific article posted talks possibility re-infection. Still scientific proof reinfection. That‚Äôs cite antidotes. Which, way, it‚Äôs science. Also, idea getting information second infection worse people rarely survive. straight misinformation. It‚Äôs combination lot things. Citizens wearing masks social distancing. Summer outdoor activities. Like places world first wave flattened. Unfortunately States none things results. already seeing signs 2nd wave beginning. So, cartwheels, pour champagne head something? /S/ Well least Trump maight right said he'll make Mexico pay Wall Ah, great state Puerto Rico couple fairly common reasons high income earner struggles afford kids. First foremost, cost healthcare United States, followed ludicrous cost college education United States, even public universities community colleges.

My husband high income earners, we're software developers. However, he's Type 1 Diabetic, costs $10,000 *per year* keep good health.

And me, almost killed car accident. passenger 0-fault vehicle, pay $40,000 pocket, fucking joke, get treatment. Insurance companies, including vehicle insurance company medical insurance company, pay jack shit case settled, took FOUR YEARS.

I walk away big payout, either. basically got reimbursed, future treatment opportunities limited, medical insurance cover settlement supposed to. horseshit, I'd rather settlement treatment covered along way. Trying deal medical bills brain injury GREAT, I'll tell much.

If dual high income household, afforded treatment. gotten treatment, could never go back high income job.

Education expenses joke, either. high wage jobs require 4-year college degree. inherited wealth, fun paying 30 years, even go public/nonprofit companies, pretty much impossible get student loans forgiven. Thanks, Betsy Devos, absolute ghoul!

So husband get paycheck right bat $2,000 monthly medical expenses us. one medications alone costs $11 per pill per day medical insurance. drive car (or really ride car) lacks modern safety features, would dead one.

Oh icing fuckin' cake leave benefits United States exist! Even fancy tech jobs, get little leave, healthcare issues, get time relax: leave goes taking time day go multiple doctor appointments us suppressed immune systems. take unpaid leave work takes bite income too.

There lots legitimate reasons people make big incomes paper, hoarding money like they're dragon sitting treasure. money flies right back door country expensive hell live in, especially lucky health inherited wealth. say getting ok. American population according Google 328,200,000 
American population infected coronavirus according Google 5,260,000. 
5,260,000 √∑ 328,200,000 = 0.0160268129
That means amount infected people gone 0.1% since last time simple math 1.5% 1.6%
I never said anything conspiracy. did. Given U.S. looks Florida, would ""Florida's Florida"" Miami-Dade Key West? Tactical dodge around first question.

Yup unicorns exist.  FWIW, Instacart lets choose precise replacement want item (or mark things replace), they'll often chat shopping get input needed. know fee may higher grocery store's, sure love able micromanage grocery shopping without actually go inside. guys ready solution ‚Äúrequired‚Äù? computers rise desks. I'm calling now. orange disaster going praise Russian vaccine, he's going say that's one need here. He's going call beautiful, gibberish. become new cloro-whatchacallit. handlers try walk one back.

I also think he's still power, god forbid, cohorts try way monkeywrench availability good vaccine US. delighted I'm wrong. Texas jumped past 20% recently, unknown reason testing lot less. [this ‚ÄúAt time, percentage tests yielding positive results climbed alarming highs, 25% average week ending Aug. 11. Abbott previously said anything 10% would considered red flag.‚Äù school districts opening person, waiting weeks. way see people acting suburban rural areas, get worse. fucking joke. precisely point.

The temperature checks security theater. provide security, false sense security, hopes it'll get people risk lives spend money. Based lies Three months! WooHoo!!! least Godzilla capable good God Emperor ... Nope, fact checking clueless idiot. Like said, you. nice life! good idea. ideology different, said ISIS wants entire idea western civilization destroyed. 330 million people US set fire would rejoice. They‚Äôre entire existence elimination. 9/11 visible Beirut explosion. Nobody going doubt happened death involved. COVID-19, however, invisible. hard many people understand behind safety measures unless they, someone know, gets infected *and* bad reaction. article says hair loss due telogen effluvium. Aka stress experience. People experience telogen effluvium many diseases. unfortunate Appreciate pointing out. think though news working &amp; approved vaccine gets released lot people (myself included) willing make extra effort wear masks, social distance becomes available them. 

If knew solution prevent Corona right around corner, I'd willing continue crappy lifestyle order make sure dont get it.  told vaccine 2-3 years away, think everyone else healthy would say yolo roll dice though. many people know they've infected without eradication rolling 3 month period falling immunity.

It's going 6 months already least.

There workable model allow people got infected claim immunity either.

This really change anything. fact confirms need stringent measures can't rely immunity. Right? Feels like everything's open went full steam ahead schools opening too. can't true schools ""SAFE"" reopen..... logic fuckers beyond Mars planet. I've since started. I'm sure half posters find responsible, necessary. summer I've hanging larger (\~8) groups outside.  [Trump administration listening Dr. Fauci re-named shit get appointment junp hoops get one wtf someone seasonal depression, worry remainder year. Depression top depression. 

I'm struggling height summer SAD coping tools going available pandemic hit world. summer coping methods (like walking outdoors lush green landscape) going available either. Worried winter going get ugly fast.

Already building winter work hideout billion lights, houseplants, coping methods. Hope it'll enough. clean items, especially mail... Hand sanitizer, Lysol key... Antibacterial soap every sink. good news, weren‚Äôt results supposed come September October? 3 months confirmed. say longer without knowing fact immunity point. Telling people basically let guard 3 months sick HUGE.

Expect couple months say 6 months, 9 months, immunity gone (though point determine immunity finished, think vaccines really concerned pandemic anymore) Yeah, ended WW2...

/s don‚Äôt think taken flu shot time US. That‚Äôs going change year. Every country problems say whaaaaaaaaaaaaannnope still hear work even active positives exposed people quarantine work, people literally happening around still live fantasy world minds. That‚Äôs kind point. feel like people completely worn would anything return normal forced lockdown again. many, jobs livelihoods depend it. Seems rather intentional government. going hell lot fewer employees work COVID spreads throughout office? 31% mind-boggling. country, positive rate considered ""critical"" (not sure would exactly happen, maybe they'd move resources elective/preventive health care corona tests). USA FINE STOP SCARING PEOPLE I'm normally day drinker, normal times good stiff drink better screaming apartment walls day. think he/she assumed op comment anti-science sentiment. annoyed op entertained possibility CDC could wrong.

That's understandable lot people (lately) automatically assume CDC (and reputable organizations) wrong without basis. However, always good use little critical judgement even best sources.

It's pedantics really - page probably expressing point clearly could. like ""at least."" anyone else experiencing feeling time moving way fast ? I‚Äôm shocked it‚Äôs mid August already. likely much longer. increasing evidence day longer term immunity. Thats confirmed certain case. Easily could be, reality longer (given corroborated reinfection claims), going say length time without 100% confident strong emperical evidence.

Expect read 6 months couple months keep learning like searching needle bundle needles. sentence follows, though, immediately tries undermine it. fewer developed countries numbers 2.7 beds per 1,000 people, per 100,000. There's 3rd option- COVID mitigation efforts drastically cut influenza transmission masks, vigilant hand washing, disinfecting measures, lockdowns, etc. Religion always hold mankind back. like crack/cocaine gullible masses. Gee age would want wheels cage could roll around. Let know survival rate drops 99.6% GOP congress screeching executive overreach second takes office.

oh wait GOP start deficit pay-as-you-go spending cuts *instant* there's Democratic president power, media nod along. live Bradley County kind behavior school board child virtual learning year. I'm confident FL prepared logistically financially handle problem, need states become involved. currently flu season southern hemisphere? winter dealing it? country could see comparable number cases Brazil although think hotter humid climate overall US matters all. Clearly well right though so... Beats GOP's numbers. I'm letting good reps take fall something support spent every day railing years That's blatant strawman position. know answer obvious no, that's ridiculous position. surely agree **is** threshold, yes? threshold anything lethal damaging flu covid surpass threshold.

The argument ""why shutdown flu."" provided answer. Covid much lethal, fucking flu vaccine, one immunity, law large numbers means **fuckton** people would die anything. Similarly, speed covid spreads number people need hospitalization, without preventative measures run risk overwhelming healthcare systems. provide real world example, live right now, county health department recently announced hospitals reporting full capacity, using extra surge capacity prepped covid shutdown. Additionally, medical staff properly care Ill, importing staff elsewhere.

And clear, done similar preventative measures flu viruses before. never heard Spanish flu pandemic? Visited burial center non-death-related work.

\#1 true. overwhelmed work. That. Unless 100% bubble (like NBA doing, far successfully), plenty opportunity encounter somebody virus passes along. Marketing/communications digital media. lead marketing associate 2 locations sports bars obviously closed immediately. said would hired back virus gone LinkedIn saw HR manager asking people connections job so....probably happening. also used develop new coaches NFL bland. think opening diversity would good thing. league seems scared change aspect. Thats kid played SEC bounce around years zero production, poor work ethic bad routes, dropped pass one missed route cost top notch FCS player midlevel FBS player. many ""studies"" seem like common sense me? give grant money scientific studies? Always good idea get flu vaccine. wonder drive clinics ger doctors offices set outside it.  curious, what's different fall? like we've taking great care like attacks. subtle ones legitimately dangerous spreading information. straight crazy ones seem relatively harmless. 

Anyone would believe it, would probably already far gone functioning adult anyways. can't balance?

Please black white say. Science shows can't packed bars. seems gaslighting remark. Yes whole system broken correct. one side much worse other. can't try paint one party literally demonize science glorify anti-intellectualism Americans *really* need overhaul science education (among things) over. send people hospital Covid ward. Yeah. superintendent [received death saying deserved tortured it.  Since COVID hadn‚Äôt hit USA last Fall isn‚Äôt fairly obvious statement? masks decrease chances much, more. Meaning would ""vaccine"" literally front noses whole time, people would comply. Chicken wings?!...Now gone far COVID! ^s statistic false. Please believe low. survey correct, seen people voting send kids school vs online learning thankful able transfer university online-only classes. still ""class"" Zoom. realized know single person knows they've COVID. know people know people got it, one know personally infected symptoms, let alone died.

By Faith Karimi Jay Croft, CNN

Updated 1:56 PM ET, Fri August 14, virus causes damage brain nervous system, known effect. causes immune system attack nerves causes shriveling neurons' myelin sheathing.  house bill since May. 100% senate Republicans. believe him, that, elected, make stopping virus significantly easier. Well, they've added quotation marks, is. We‚Äôd seeing reinfections thousands. literally spreading misinformation go: imagine impact world virus hang frozen food packaging infect people thaws out?

The basis statement entirely accurate. 

Once frozen food packaging recognized vector, tracing source train infection may well provide solution. example, frozen container actually exposed virus ship's fecal mater? easy fix. 

In meantime, ensuring food safety simple ensuring frozen food packaging infected well-known food viruses deal regular basis. Requires cooking food 75c, using viral disinfectants clean cooking surfaces ensuring there's cross food contamination. 

I see positive possibly leading us understand started. take train ‚Äúoff hours‚Äù evenings early morning generally packed trains. never look far spot someone mask. may sane comment I've read here; \*transition\* back normal vaccine. Also, Fauci fortune-teller, he's probably wisely making conservative estimate. Won‚Äôt influenza season much mild usually since sick people stay home everyone masked? not? 

# New Zealand Says Put New COVID Infectees &amp; Family Members ‚ÄúQuarantine Facilities‚Äù essential worker hella weird right one hand, least make money unlike rest country except people work home jobs hand, every day go work risking life-in case, less money week people currently making unemployment even cut weekly amount half. know Philippines locked can't leave house exercise. eased couple months ago believe locked again.

Can confirm. True he‚Äôs least problems now. You‚Äôre right. America crumble like ussr. long term health damage? risk passing onto family members children? There's ton legal/ethical/moral options, besides electoral politics. that's kids taught.  Booster shots  Also 320 million... basic math smh

""The current population United States America 331,224,597 Wednesday, August 12, 2020, based Worldometer elaboration latest United Nations data""

He 19 million out, 11 million out. Weird smug it. Let's move them. really powers. fact, they've help people contempt. anything. 

Please, PLEASE try focusing anger parties bad things. focusing wrong parties descend fascism. would say track considering fall Spanish Flu really took started killing people. Trump administration teeing huge money shot Covid-19 opening schools fall.  senate broken, time ~~change~~ general strike.

Are listening? letting dictate? argument population cares, hard truth is, don't. Yes many care, cannot kid saying everyone cares. nice! Yep. 

Physical well-being top priority. Mental well-being second. Education third. 

Unfortunately many, needs food shelter force tough decisions meet even first priority. 

I don‚Äôt actually care kids learn book-wise year. get resilience, confidence thrive challenges grow up, succeeded. we? Southern hemisphere experiencing winter idea would think. *So dark... sure CDC Universe?* This, need hear hair falling wear mask socially distance, someone meds keep hair makes anxious üò¢ Preach! one parents on-line school district parents acting like I‚ÄôM insane one. say things like ‚ÄúWell Bobby Suzy WANT go back school that‚Äôs we‚Äôre doing‚Äù parent choice matter. We‚Äôre talking 5th graders, list things WANT really bad ideas long. daughter social loves school, would love go in-person also understands it‚Äôs good idea right now. truly understand parents can‚Äôt work home don‚Äôt choice lot (a lot) parents know going in-person work home stay home moms. local PTA group (most stay home) went local news cheerlead school district go full-time person excited see kids get school bus again. Look, 95% time feel like inadequate parent &amp; stepparent guess least didn‚Äôt go news giggle like school girl &amp; talk can‚Äôt wait kid go school PANDEMIC. Reddit safe place ;) That‚Äôs thing science. go it‚Äôs pace. can‚Äôt say it‚Äôll gone summer 2021 magically happens. takes longer find vaccine takes longer. tried U.S., people would absolutely revolt.

Here, many consider freedom important anything, even life. Perhaps that's grow told many people died secure freedom dying one's freedom noble thing. ""Give liberty, give death!"" big part history.

Unfortunately twisted people use freedom excuse selfish. use freedom good things, instead many use freedom selfish. Many Americans react badly told do. cost lot lives. Wtf, shit insane now. least would think would responsibility property management company find someone repairs masked instead thinking pass her. Also seriously doubt doctor told someone emphysema wear mask anything telling wearing mask like life depends it. Yup. fucking sucks make sacrifices longers others busy enjoying life. insanely unfair. fuck. terrifying US: Help me, I've fallen can't get up! Try get nature side. Use atm machines exposed direct sunlight (uv's great job), eat healthy food good amount bio ingredients, sleep well stress. Stress brings down, immunity goes down. outdoors sport activity, practice good hygiene ask doctor ok extra vitamin C D3. normal affraid, smart everything fine. Lol course privatized medical insurance carriers would bank pandemic. people get kind sick thrill killing people? That's think explain now. whole world's gone mad. guess need lead Resistance^TM. Hey bro im Canadian dont know specifics would consider ‚Äúfar left‚Äù candidate US...  considered Bernie Yang decent ideas better whole balancing rich paying fair portion taxes Hey great time ""try something new"". could always ask parents small loan start new business. Meh, trump wins anyway. sure let‚Äôs send kids back school /s Despite rather poor country Thailand managed crisis well.

Partly Thais spoilt firstworlders, would rather infect families question never-ending normalcy bias. blame first-years? 

Many may missed final months high school, Prom, graduation. summer without usual post-high school grad mayhem. Fewer summer jobs. Parents restrictive. couldn‚Äôt see friends. travel. 

That couldn‚Äôt contain themselves? Kind uncharitable expect them. I‚Äôm sunset park work spike went two fold. people still walking around groups masks I‚Äôm happy defer epidemiologist who‚Äôd like correct me.

But that‚Äôs true, hope vaccine? vaccine works sort tricking body produce antibodies needed immunity, natural immunity gain actually Covid protects 3 months... would vaccine anymore successful? Well duh. thought common knowledge? guess 1/4 people denial anti-maskers? So, many human sacrifices revise that? Lol France locking again. Literally day claimed flattened curve. But...Trump thanked Twitter today? feel better, right? Trump needs eat fiber. Problem Solved. Lol false hive mind downvote oblivion. don‚Äôt expect anyone doesn‚Äôt bike understand though- I‚Äôm defending rally happening, funny people talking culture like part know. general strike would likely work enough folks participate. Look history (Russia 1905 one example). sure good thing dictate policy based portfolio, Hehe ...Sure good thing.

(sips tea rocks chair) report numbers skewed reduce real numbers. horrifying, trying tell people tell job fiance that's immune compromised... falls deaf ears. can't seem explain one coworkers im uncomfortable serving fully established masks effective. making feel like I'm giving time I've put towards management (Had 2 yrs a.m. experience 2 different departments). fiance sick since may, point can't get anything fixed apartment kitchen sink leaking, bedroom power, can't peat control, well enough required return work, even though able work home (within confines fatigue, nausea, shortness breath, lack appetite, elevated temp (usually high 99s-low 100s) rash trunk, upper limbs, face come go multiple times within day). Sorry vent... thanks listening lol? necessarily. frozen surface packaging packaging jostled around unloaded knocked loose, partially melted aerosolised, could breathed workers without PPE. know Covid thrives meat plant temperatures, cold store would similar to. small clipit information easily persuade folks continue safe measures

it won't, online already see stuff like ""well, flu causes well"" true except ignoring fact flu vaccine... transmission rates lot higher. prefer call ‚Äúfucking morons‚Äù That's talk. use inherent contempt powers performative politics. Last time that, wasn't' covered mainstream news. covered right-wing media called us (not correctly) ""antifa"" complained blocked people trying go home work. 

So I'm sure helped. America pussified Yeah, would bet subsequent bouts still easier fight off. mid march. Think may exposed recently (mid-July visiting sick relative ICU several times). Felt like might gotten sick again, lighter case resolved much quickly. Always suspicious ellipses quotes Train get life alert??? I'm 29 I've seen commercials... know make it. tested something real, failed spectacularly.

The obvious position would tell people wear masks precaution, even fully understand virus. ""Hey, hurt, beautiful MAGA masks campaign website. know they're really something. best masks, I'm told. Good filtration. Insert inevitable nationalistic bullshit here.""

It would cheaper lockdowns. still might them, least could orderly instead hitting panic stop button whole country. massive spike saw early July slow burn, winter might apocalyptic.  Ahhh Tennessee, truly center educated people south....

It's actually politicized issue moment here. [This thing could find (sadly, biased).  Oh like ""immigrant convoys almost killed us all"" right midterms? Projection usual Lockdowns prologue curve, lockdown implemented slow curve attempt get vaccine quick possible, always case. Ofcourse spikes soon ease restrictions. get podcast ITunes elsewhere.  think empathetic trustworthy good communicating public epithelial cells gums? cares it‚Äôs racist long works.

In comparison, SIDS kills ~2500 infants per year.

The child nearly 100x likely randomly die die COVID-19.

Not diminish 26 children's deaths. death awful. risk analysis, important remember infants statistically safe COVID-19. one person? think end discovering places deadly strains, along obese populations lead higher death rates. America really done anything different Europe. Luckily I'm Oregon issue. Buenos Aires, Argentina (I live 50 km's outside city)

The patient themself gets decide based *their own* personal preference, later life. Yes, answer can't piece-meal bit complicated. biggest issue preventing piece-mealing there's single thing done, done soon - continuing unemployment stimulus. However, accomplished, sense urgency pass additional things gone. parties understand one bill passed, whatever included added later another bill. 

Piece-mealing possible pieces initial one incentive bargained compromised on. 

The Repubs absolutely want employer protections (their red line) included (this means employees return work contract covid workplace ability sue employer damages, hospital bills, loss life) Dems want opposite, want employees able demand safe work environments able hold employers responsible providing safe environments staff pandemic (their blue line). 

Both parties agree unemployment stimulus absolutely needs passed passed soon, passed either conditions met, absolutely bargaining power included future bill. Hence, piece-mealing possible due incentive initial piece. 

This sense urgency creates essentially high-stakes game 'chicken', neither party wants agree passing urgent unemployment stimulus provision without secondary demand met, longer play game, American people suffer.

With fire, top it...  away guns people

No talking Biden Harris coming take away everyone's guns ""any guns people."" 

Those two fundamentally different arguments isn‚Äôt conspiratorial. really believed opinions weren‚Äôt shitty, wouldn‚Äôt make new account spew misinformation. point reach breaking point? much longer put much? 

I guess November telling regards two questions. Trump gets re-elected, Covid-19 going away time soon Mitch's Bitches keep getting away destroying lives anyone around stop him. Unless Biden gets elected appoints Beto rourke, says would do, tries mandatory buyback ars aks . what? joking? years I've loudmouth subtle (or subtle) change terminology. 

Social Security taxes touted employee/employer/government assisted savings account Americans. deducted paychecks, like tax, payroll deduction held retirement, invested retirement. beginning, one, even Federal government, could use money anything paying retirees who'd paid it. money, ones paid it. 

It part unified budget President Johnson, man dick larger IQ, decided needed borrow fund pump money blood war Viet Nam. 

Social Security NEVER taxed, Reagan decided needed sweet sweet dollars retirees. taxed 50% benefits received  increased 85% benefits received. 

In beginning Social Security, SS number could used except federal government. 70's, federal government got panties wad illegal immigration, really cover story REALLY worried about: black people might cheating welfare system. So, sudden, SSN became official ID furnish anyone, anytime. 

Enter identity theft. 

Now Trump wants suspend FICA tax, order give taxpayers break disc coronavirus. unfund Social Security Medicare. Since they've using funds every pet project imagine, coffers little lacking. that's really problem. husband paid SS Medicare entire working lives, since Johnson every single president pilfered SS fund, there's real need replenish SS taxes (yes, tax) us paid entire working lives reimbursed. 

I hate politicians, them, especially ones calling Social Security ""entitlement"" like f'n money they've ""saving"" me. Yes yes yes. Feed hate. allow Trump enact martial law stay power quite shame democrats holding country hostage want 1 trillion bail poorly run cities (not due covid 19) accountability way spent covid... Nope.

Unfortunately, ‚Äúit couldn‚Äôt came lab‚Äù articles seem hold weight people believe them. better idea protect yourself, others around well. helps everyone take heart wear proper masks/respirators properly.

I hope get lucky smarten start protecting well. Good Ha! exactly right.  I'm you. insulted dismissed back February/March saying going bad unlike anything almost anyone alive today experienced.

I truly hope give teachers respect deserve. hope alright :). worked home improvement store beginning year recently signs everywhere saying everything sanitized.

Narrator: not. virus single cell organism, ""survive"" host. simply exists outside replicates within host cell. Plus triple digit heat! wish knew Thank highlighting point. spent weeks cleaning sanitizing schools cases day one. close days clean sanitize invite back. changed? actually found virus even transmit effectively surfaces objects?

We know what's worked countries. know social distancing, mask wearing personal hygiene effective methods combatting virus. None seems part discussion.

The discussion reopening schools seemed turn almost exclusively (inaccurate) assessments virus's effect children teachers, administrators support personnel also schools children go home school adults many generations.

It appears Col. Nathaniel Jessup right, ""we can't hand truth."" curious, option keep kids home learn online?

Here city texas, face face classes resume option keep kids home rest year. [Georgia end school goes narrative.  
Most articles COVID misleading, sadly. Yes. usually start first week August. corona, ‚Äúdelayed‚Äù mid-August. Coward wash clothes come back home? 'home' clothes. Yay, populism! arguing pointless semantics. mask longer operates valved mask, matters. Arguing semantics function thing matters pointless trolling.

Stop bothering me. too. really don‚Äôt want to. want kids school, homeschooling parents antivaxers, hairy pits look incest.

We gathering bunch parents town together, ones choosing remote learning home schooling year outdoor play recess walks woods shit social interaction.

I fucking hate this, nothing want children all. since people fucking dumb didn‚Äôt listen warnings think conspiracy parents make best choices children‚Äôs health happiness. something think twice about. local district seemed sketchy asked happens outbreak, kinda passed CDC they‚Äôll make decision there. Nah fuckers immediately tell everyone continue remote learning get everyone tested. San Fran mayor first US city start locking down. banned mass gatherings (sports, music) first positive case city. allowed masks valves since day one. . leadership there!

Will stop evictions. one they‚Äôre hypocritical. even let localities mask mandate, banning it.


Then himself.

Now he's saying ""Covid Fatigue"" puts lot blame people following directions think important two months ago. see issue spamming sub virus?

If walked started posting comments like ""Trail tears"", ""Guantanamo bay"", I'd sure get banned whim. 

Because Rule 4 thing. /u/_Cromwell_ write precaution list. recommendations help actualize &amp; reduce OCD. Ok tell New Zealand. love job ‚Äî 17th year. It‚Äôs hard believe real. sister stopped going elementary school ""being bullied"" really bullying, parents pulled never went back, stayed home played computer day room.

Now 18 still that. education whatsoever. think might job, idk. know help bills household though BOY HOWDY MALE GUESS DUMP ENTIRE PAYCHECKS SHITTY FAMILY YEARS

Needless say lot children getting lick schooling long time. Plan worst, hope best. hear you, think things *quite* bad portrayed, although obviously flowers puppies either.

Something something freedom something eternal vigilance go. nothing else, pandemic really highlighted cultural political sickness heart nation. Again, strawman. never suggested lockdown vaccine came out.

We plenty strategies counter covid use involve going full lockdown vaccine developed. seems serious misunderstandings that. even nothing question whether **specifically schools** open, whether required maintain social distancing mask policy open person education. think compared throwing smoke alarm beeped warn smoldering fire one able put out. mean, clearly wrong, üî•. 

Public health officials cannot win. raise alarm bells stave disasters successful, blamed alarmists. let things actually get control, failed job preventing disaster. weights mat, helps meanwhile :)

It's running different, ya know?  Record four years currently. never global vaccine effort like level medtech available. men America need get shit together stop fragile fucking egos. Well make sense issues then, I'll tell that.

""Hey guys, maybe subject animals lifetime suffering without end eat hamburger"" (downvote -50) ""Hey guys, maybe idea improving society systematically imposing coercion, violence negative reinforcement across entire population wrong"" (downvote -90) Well what's important someone's blame you. Good luck China. LeBron? three months thing doubt they've able model safe answer time goes on.

Consider confident three months, study known infections, follow around three month period, establish model suggesting high probability re-exposure near-to subsequent 3 month milestone which, immunity, patient expected get reinfected...

They're giving conservative data points here, likely enough time elapsed get enough patients support longer period confidence level.  Highly touted New Zealand issue right now. Lockdowns effective. risk sick quarantined So, let get straight, Covid-19 WAY contagious flu social distancing/wearing masks/washing hands protect infected . things protect flu? 

Flu numbers dropped dramatically pandemic began, nation STILL lockdown CDC thinks it‚Äôs going flu season shit show? 

By Bizarro World logic?!?! Result nuclear testing past guess wouldn't, unless learned this, interact him? I'm guessing know seriously take this. mailman showed outside one time said ""hey thanks, I'll keep six feet thank you"" went inside. really kept like 20 feet away closest point came. read sources (which I‚Äôm sure didn‚Äôt lol) first non-peer reviewed abstract latter actually hinting even fact can‚Äôt get reinfected. Cmon man. population considerably lower. ~100 million sorry tremendous losses. can‚Äôt imagine ever getting something like that.

I admire strength. Sometimes, surviving another day victory. 

Can ask kind work do?

Are staying connected people via zoom? It‚Äôs white people seeking confine primarily brown people - quarantining white people sick. may think it‚Äôs escalation strategy, you‚Äôd willfully blind know minority communities would view it.

Public trust remains strongest weapon fight virus astonishes authorities willingly throw away expediency. Messaging matters. vp anymore so....

I mean wtf fuck shit? like pelosi cares, back home eating $25 pint gelato next years, something like play radio tv new 1984 reality.

Maybe coming like jerk then- agree able conversations, obviously. think ""cite sources"" catchall phrase applies point anyone ever makes, essentially point comment.

/u/createthiscom

Like data said though, ans getting at, think page here. Long term immunity would end pandemic. wonder that‚Äôs true. articles that? concept context speak long keep getting unemployment money I'll perfectly fine :) 2/3rds American children karma point deficiency. selfish fucker. Theater! soon done better US. correct.

It genetic proofreading makes quite stable. Especially since D614G mutation fully optimized infecting humans. need mutate unless certain mutations begin sacrificing virulence contagiousness. would good thing. Try wrong percentage showing symptoms. like dump mix place similar population, size latitude hard lockdown hit harder Sweden. Well, I'm US, I'm seeing lot mask adherence urban rural settings. Though live Minnesota. feeling look State State basis. a, ""US bad!"", thing. Florida probably worse Minnesota, though. Sam Diego county around Escondido Well stop making stupid assumptions. it‚Äôs highly unlikely COVID get worse way. Generally, pathogens become less deadly rather deadly. WW1 turned ordinary natural selection head people milder flu cases stayed fight severe cases put cramped train cars sent unsanitary military hospitals potent strains spread homefront around world. ordinary times you‚Äôd expect opposite: people milder cases would go lives spread mild strain people severe cases would isolated hospitalized spread version less. Constitution ridiculous sad thing even see healthcare professionals properly following guidelines. 2 anecdotal examples recently

1. Went endodontic consultation. guy late came masks on, proceeded talk (as patient) mask on. guy also graduated one top medical schools nation UCSF.. seriously flabbergasted
2. Saw 3 hospital works inside cafe. (looked like surgeons) continuously taking masks inside store bare hands sipping coffee waiting pastry (standing around). One even took mask completely indoors least minute....

If see healthcare professionals even taking seriously expect rest population better? Also, pretty high income neighborhood, random shit hole spot US, seriously wtf addition, side wants listen experts teach critical thinking also happens side new wave progressives care trying fix things.

But y'know, sides amirite. Thank announcing making dumbest fucking comment day. Hopefully spare experiencing remainder illiterate gibberish. god wants dead kids..... already mutating sometime however seems following contagious less lethal route, lot people going die. Well that's technically true. spread food, spread spit food hands touched food.  got 3 month reminder post yikes  everyone comes er get tested sometimes already causes big er back ups hospital. imagine complications people start coming kinds respiratory ailments. *mind-boggling* Caring public safety bestest way piss people Time tell long term consequences disease well... it‚Äôs stupid treat like it‚Äôs typical virus. Fauci worried something innocuous. News 1100 CA? Depends. Last year take grandmother hospital regular checkup flu shots since flu season coming up. insurance cover hospital able get free flu shot anyways there. Basically WWI, sickest soldiers would sent back hospitals/home would spread there, less sick would able still fight send strain back home countries. Despite living conservative area, seems lot local postal workers happy shenanigans, they'll best get things need go. hope persevere.

Our county building requires go revolving door, find appealing whatsoever! Way capture concentrate germs! talking drop box first floor guard station. really hope put variety drop boxes around town, make accessible everyone able vote. 

My local county clerk Republican, he's also top-notch guy Trumper, thankfully. He's adamant voting accessible all, I'm really glad that. lot places going like that, all. I‚Äôm vegan anarchist. make sense! That's problem, it? Fauci throwing stones glass house rushed Russian vaccine US efforts rushed well. I'd hope era we'd warned medical field. concerned invented facts make us feel better? see lot happening.

I mean, could said 'can please stick facts, people'... Thanks input. People *will* die, people *have* died, people *are* dying. Yknow, yeah. think maybe business? sure. already know Right moment catch flu season, ""I already got COVID got it, need wear mask anymore!"" Well would obviously depend household, young parents late 20s early 30s otherwise healthy also extraordinarily low risk contract disease.

If 45 obese heart attack great grandmother lives obviously household different. Hence first part statement know going household. agree disturbing.

I'm sure whether racist.

There's logical argument they've changed procedure despite race parties involved knowledge gained since ""round 1"".

They've since seen significant violation isolate-at-home Australia, example. Cali / resturant life resturant ramping like crazy, last week broke records busy was. Everyone‚Äôs going life‚Äôs we‚Äôre allowed big party groups again. 

Shits scary safe everyone It‚Äôs reddit, majority post sensualist titles promote hive mind‚Äôs idea‚Äôs here. appears tracker data Aug. 3 - number infections linked athletics know same, may difficult since many people want it, bought workout equipment home. wait 3 months get since demand high, helped feel much better able regularly exercise home. hope dont leave much lasting damage.. whole debacle really made consider kids. wouldnt want bring world knowing much worse world we're leaving one left us. OP also opened floor asking anyone could think another reason.  see that? see:

u/Eltotsira referring post was: think possibilities besides 2 presented?

but disagree u/Eltotsira saying ""coming like jerk"". fine discuss things understanding others points.

I'm pretty sure nobody thread disputing integrity CDC.

u/myne presenting dichotomy assumption 195,000 premise accurate.  true, going get significantly worse people expected CDC wrong (unlikely). sill dr fauci go jail?  mean compared early 90‚Äôs sure oils cheaper past 2 decades. agree cheap 100 years ago. can‚Äôt afford bill that‚Äôs coming. Yeah, left gate Reagan occupied office. Notice say 'elected'. always half dozen reasons fight it, mostly coming time cost

Oh man, feel this, fact ‚Äúcost‚Äù even issue comes healthcare (including mental healthcare) sends rage/despair cycle. (Ah, rage-spair, new best friend.) mention trying find doctor fits well struggling mental health adds whole element difficulty. 

I‚Äôm glad family looking you! Maybe keep eye open telehealth options, that‚Äôs possibility? least way wouldn‚Äôt deal added anxiety face-to-face interactions covid times.  wow... way jump someone making joke. Everything fucked up. pointing finger anyone sharing conspiracies. reports Russia China already messing election process thought would bit obvious. Banning smoking altogether would even better measure. 

Coronavirus 6 months killed around 750 000 people. 

Smoking kills 8 000 000 per year. yes. ex smoker. worst... Wholly agree. See Mauritius recent example. Doomers absolute shambles right now. would move anywhere, force em stay home Norway. read USA, glad neither family lives there. Love New Zealand btw, visited country pre covid. Beautiful place! Great job virus btw :)  Oh makes sense  Right, two three culprits likely? know. America could never kind lockdown. Even beginning mayor Los Angeles told citizens fine go exercise realized ppl would rebel locked house arrest. Hey look guys! another random Reddit user knows better CDC, estimates infection fatality rate .26-.8% normal non-pandemic numbers? imagine they‚Äôd already average year even without pandemic :/ Seriously, Corona aside, people support ecologically damaging industry? hoping Corona would kill off.. Wut? 

It's worked fine Sweden. Sweden achieved herd immunity.

The cost even high. 6000 100,000 Swedes die year died COVID. Many (most?) died would died year anyway, average age death older average life expectancy.  next mass health crisis obesity related already factor covid death stats.  People like talk stuff page... well yeah.... reads ‚Äòtoo low‚Äô it‚Äôs close enough. vast majority Swedes live southern third country, population density populated parts country isn‚Äôt much lower average European country. Stockholm dense European capitals. 

Plus, covid-19 spreads clusters, density doesn‚Äôt seem relevant rates infection. People rural areas still go store, go work etc. 100 hospitals Sweden, means one hospital every 450km. unlucky would travel 225 km get hospital. still better Australia hospitals built 10400km apart, based hospital density. Something wrong logic? make sense compare densities like that? need write folk songs it, passed generation generation. ;)

Even ww1/ww2, really sure belongs collective memories. Probably amount books/movies lot people denial lifestyle health problems type 2 diabetes. seen information safe get one. children infants able get vaccine? difference one two already used regularly humans. antibodies twice fully expected. That's different getting virus twice. Got it. Maybe 5. Thanks It‚Äôs experimental. It‚Äôs well known medical circles. It‚Äôs delay factor. People heard tests slow return results probably discouraged many.

Though think result returns speeding back up. quarantine orders absolute joke here,  yup....I work private aviation, assure everyone means flocking Cancun, Cabo, Puerto Vallarta, etc seemingly every day live near dutch border amount People wearing masks almost non excistent. Mask wearers usually belgian. Larger cities problems rising cases starting demand Mask wearing tho. could piece shit. Oh that's helpful ""Japanese planes myth created drape companies sell light blocking drapes"" Well... interesting Never heard weird reason. People Ehlers Danlos report issues strong perfumes chemicals general. Sadly, lots people EDS also get told psychological issues (even ones proven genetic mutation). Throw plane. Lets forgot multi-billion dollar corporations need bailing financial reserves stocks tumble trump US. trump pushed Hydroxy nobody bought it. He's still touting nobody pays attention trump. Lol Hitchcock played long game. arguing don‚Äòt think experimental, prophylactic treatment would need protected little bit SDK every developer registered Apple got sent? 

A drug would save billions lives would create actual war true?

Yeah no. course allowed acknowledge existence. ‚ÄûIt‚ÄòS cOmMoN sEnSe‚Äú..  available reading Europe. someone copy paste article please ? don‚Äôt *think* migratory birds NZ. It‚Äôs something like 1,500mi Australia. USA... part county? industry in? 

I‚Äôve heard anyone moping around wonder bubble area due industry maybe one talking sad number seems high me. Oh want criticize Xi, okay here's think:

* bit slow putting focus key technology area development thus allowing China several technical weaknesses countries could exploit trade war, example chip making, aerospace engine etc

* reliant global trade China's food security, ie agriculture neglected order focus uplifting manufacturing sector sophistication

* He's weak nuanced exporting China's culture, world still dominated western value system

* He's inclined personal glorification, results fewer technocrats central local governments arise due ability many yes-men get government position good purely following political directives kissing asses

That last one closely linked early bad handling COVID-19 still small scale Wuhan. HTX here....I feel ya Actually UK decided revise death toll. said earlier talks today closest match already known (but scene NZ) UK strain. look horror happening Victoria, Australia right acting late reasonable. Lockdown hard early = lockdown shortest possible time minimum damage. going continue lie results studies mislead people, blatantly lying cause harm.

Stop bothering lies misinformation. got covid mid march pcr positive still neurological issues, shortness breath sore throat data valved n95 masks? still referring counterfeit one reason? really want know able hear valve made of, flapper. sounds like hell talent, blatant lie.

Continuing push something know true blatant lie. insisting lying data shows? ""n95"" referring even made correct material.

If think substituting random items calling whatever want makes items whatever call them, capable conversation.

If going continue lie spread misinformation, stop bothering now. people can‚Äôt take vaccine medical reasons

How many people would be? neighbors Us, they‚Äôd think America = US that‚Äôs think here, US. That‚Äôs meaning ‚ÄúUS-centric‚Äù: centers think US... that‚Äôs necessarily negative, shows one way thinking. 

I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs pedantic say, ‚Äúnot everyone thinks way‚Äù Damn son bout maaaaad y‚Äôall! family BC apparently planning send kids back school next month. Seems like brilliant plan... you‚Äôre dumb. get paid post negative shit covid response? get paid taco bell gift cards? denominations higher $25, sequential serial numbers! like Putin sent bunch PPE left country without enough, show. saying wear mask. think safety precautions definitely followed.

Unless mask comfortable, since implying I'm ""special"". 

You said special enough expected wear uncomfortable simply say work constantly moving 12 hours straight mask protects me, provided increased breathability, reduced heat humidity preferred.

I know is, mask less effective, wrong. Especially someone working around sick people. patients people exposing whatever pick hospital.

But bet flight deck gear gulf far worse whatever wearing far hotter conditions. deal far qualifications, I'm BA BSN RN PHN 11 years acute care experience.

Scary think comfort important safe possible then. First off, article author, post thread OP (who criticises Trump praises masks posts), woman praised. no, think flagged correct one.

Yes title read ambiguously. gives clear context makes reading shaming clearly wrong interpretation:

""While viral videos seem feature Karens refusing wear masks (e.g¬†‚ÄòAirline Karen‚Äô) public, positive #WearADamnMask¬† message went viral recently.""

- article author.

""Sounds like really rough day.'

And yet continued think wider message #WearADamnMask #MasksSaveLives""

- OP wish they‚Äôd transport senators home vacation without relief deal. Anyone considered animals? Like birds??? Okay fair points good place end it. Stay safe homey! many things could throw mostly environment though, right? Like ambient temperature, air movement, etc. Seems like need general public reference point. need specific temperature, comparison. would think person temperature would always show warmer surrounding people moments environment.  would negative tests, virus loves butt air That‚Äôs go-to can‚Äôt find any. writing scenario book virus called AIDS-CoV-1 spreads airborne 25% mortality rate. Fucking white people dumb Yeah, it‚Äôs financial hardship part causes distress. Damn straight course not. security theater again. ""worse"" person one higher probability spreading covid. Whether knowingly irrelevant. Gosh something could done prevent started affecting children. (s) assume even valve masks better mask, I'd love see comparison normal cloth mask. googled direct referendum found [a NCSL breakdown USA's direct/indirect/popular referendum process. looks like statewide level though couldnt used make changes federally. Got French did. know could hard might want take while.

My son missed 8th grade due mental health issues. time thought going end world him. Fast forward years caught graduated early started college 16.

Missing school hurt kid much think might. catching virus could really set back. Kinda like never second wave long mired first  Leadership post-911 arguably worse now. Teachers queen creek also pay back 3% salary resign. nightmare. Afaik first covid case china, Asian community self-isolated, Chinese flights banned. 

After handled, Italians, Americans cruise ships let in, went control isolation, masks, distancing guys. left buying guns millions since March, included generalization? one people wants someone pull trigger you? smell chicken hawk. report tips? getting paid even job one holiday dumb needs go away. Exactly. parents siblings, coworkers every poor fuck might come contact them. 35 minimum here. measured forehead IR thermometer internal temp 102 got 96-98. Mitch McConnell still win election ... Trump administration multiple pandemic simulations 2019. knew care. God. That's horrific. Birx disappeared she? VIRAL. Must nice millionaires worry one millions jobless people facing eviction hunger. 

They get what‚Äôs coming them. 100% effective. Let's say 60% effective, still significant community spread. still risk critical mass people get vaccinated (herd immunity) still guaranteed case count extremely low. need wear mask, obviously. things increase odds catching it:

1) open windows doors 

2) wear swim goggles virus infect eyes. particle wear face mask. 

3) set aside decontamination area home. put outside clothes bag washed. 

4) wear outside shoes homes typically covered vruses. 

5) take shower returning school fucking kidding me??? one check April theyre going vacation rn everythings ok?? Mother fuckers source that? swear people rude now. Like get high horse lol know doesn't? Would enough virus infections? virus behavior like glue less like paint sticks objects rather smearing? Wear mask. Halloween. like every year time cloth mask underneath. satisfy health requirements. Wait school starts person. Yeah, hope McConnell gets voted too. excuse allow this. Welcome science, mostly unshackled stupid underfunding money grubbing finance depts approving jack shit coz think it'll profitable. 

If money god damn focal point entire society, we'd much along species, discoveries-wise. Dems calling 600 months. sustainable 2/3 releif money go ultra wealthy class. jobs go back to, incentives damned. Wow that‚Äôs horrible demand really high basically example like 100 doses really 50 doses, unless say dose mean two shots I‚Äôm asking bc really don‚Äôt know, rude, could hypothetically also allow kid go school? ex-husband power you? That's want bust obscene stimulus payment people get October. perfectly honest ‚Äúhealthcare‚Äù system seemed absolutely miserable covid can‚Äôt imagine. work adjacent hospitals really feel sorry ppl subject horrible policies, norms, practices, everything. Hospitals freaking horrible everyone. make money misery customers misery it‚Äôs misery around that‚Äôs brings money. bad horrible advice brings money usually give bad horrible advice things, bring thousands miserable ppl miserable buildings recirculate stale miserable air, prevent anyone accessing good food fresh air, on, rampant malpractice, overwork regular way life (what kind example that??)... it‚Äôs fucking awful.

There reason believe people level immunity common cold coronaviruses, sort like cowpox gives people immunity smallpox. 

Bedford really weigh that, he's pointing stop precautionary stuff, cases go up. 20-30% fine, magic number, going change people change behavior. pretty smart. didn‚Äôt know could gather type information sewage. I'm you, Dr. Fauci. know least quarantine home aren‚Äôt going test. works way doesn‚Äôt. delicate balance printing money print money. seems good first glance, allows rich congressmen hold need checks. would create issue worse filibuster kinda aggressive... least area (NE US) it‚Äôs intended kind shorthand ‚Äúindeed fucked bullshit you‚Äôre referencing others say‚Äù. 


It‚Äôs like way aggressively agreeing one person shit someone else saying? trying explain guess find struggling... continue online learning point going back school get sick die [You know exactly *least* two zeros. Sigh.... Decreased testing increased positivity imply ""peak cases"". Exactly hard suffocating find Georgia. reason would trace there, track hide them. residents Georgia Florida fucked. think happening New Zealand? didn‚Äôt go away there. 

More cases New Zealand 100 days community acquired cases. Auckland stage 3 lockdown rest stage 2. think NZ lying? go away there? it‚Äôs spreading. clearly don‚Äôt take action, spread again. that, unless vaccine develops, soon, need continue locking reopening long time. absolutely agree you. need young people actually know think. idiot orange guy 90 year old dementia wear mask schools A/C. literally can't breathe mask 50 degrees class fan's anything huffingtonpost.ca may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage, post automatically removed. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* guess don‚Äôt understand viruses work. You‚Äôve already shown don‚Äôt understand basic math guess that‚Äôs surprising. one enjoying double entendre calling ""viral"" photo? is.

9/11 gave us shoe theatre.

Covid gives us disinfection theatre. bet guy nobody wants shift lmaoo Niqabs banned lots countries public places like Algeria, Tunisia, etc. Even Egypt, islamic country, considering ban niqabs. Trust guys care all. fact want kids get sick purpose they're like guinea pigs them. want prevent spread, believe discipline?

We've tried nothing, we're ideas, man!?!  I‚Äôm husband father support myself, wife son. weeks ago terminated job (for reason) don‚Äôt know I‚Äôm gonna pay rent month. government doesn‚Äôt care though. worked table can‚Äôt even collect unemployment. basically do. Wipe groceries go fridge, get used days, 70% IPA paper towels. 

The things sit pantry least days get wiped down. We're using reusable grocery bags currently, stores around asked bring store. true. They‚Äôre starting figure proper growth cultures SARS-CoV-2.

Even that, tell nothing what‚Äôs needed infectious dose human.

It tell viable virions survive surface time, that‚Äôs already yes. Still quite different possibility probability exclusively fomite human transmission.  actually think overly optimistic. really simple looks. federal government completely broken beyond repair, detached reality, need DEMAND change right now. US beyond saving point. naive fantastical everyone else think would get sort help beyond CARES Act. Trump‚Äôs unconstitutional hollow EO‚Äôs lifeline millions have, happens FEMA nothing left budget unemployment benefits robbed blind? blame GOP soulless corrupt want. ever expect we‚Äôll ever something better childish. 35 *so far*. Voluntold termed it. lot us voluntold stuff isn‚Äôt responsibility. I‚Äôm saying China‚Äôs numbers claim little community spread outside Wuhan start epidemic basically community spread now. 

Their claimed infection numbers minuscule. 

So, could multiple people become reinfected circumstances? 

Either aren‚Äôt reinfections China lying numbers. agree. district I‚Äôm talking actually good plan. exponential growth. pandemic flu season coming Covid flu time completely possible. Yet I've seen lots people Facebook feed printing mask exempt badges. fucking care, live there. give much shit countries doing? Eyes work super chief guess getting information. Unfortunately, probably much except already. find sometimes discussions it, could study anti-mask conspiracy theories keep peddling, figure counter examples them, least ready next discussion. keep hearing eating takeout safe covid 19 respiratory illness. get people basically say 100% safe.  Let's say worst case scenario someone covid 19 keeps talking right front food preparing mask. eat breath mouth (when stuffy nose) theory covid 19 food make way lungs? article back concern all? I'm saying quite understanding science issues try explain using science. get people saying would lot cases also know cases reported. believe Canada number people antibodies 4 times number reported cases (from one research room error i'm sure) everyone covid 19 antibodies month two later. I'm guessing based maybe number cases higher 4 times number tested cases. know I'm supposed function knowing I'm surrounded murderers sociopaths. That's unfortunately view coworkers especially bosses.

Not one checked quarantined covid got supervisor throws huge house parties. One guy high ladder checked ready return work. People still getting sick nobody fucking cares. driving insane. can't stand people anymore.  ""no-ride"" lists? families  america includes restaurants banks. social distancing masks absolutely doable whatever amount time need them

No absolutely not. hate it, people done less year it'll paranoid left on. 

How expect nightclubs open social distancing? Concerts, bars, etc..Just reddit thinks drinking alone home playing video games normal make so. Kitchen manager here

I‚Äôve working least six days week, weeks it‚Äôs seven days, since started. literally can‚Äôt take vacation restaurant collapse itself. Can‚Äôt afford hire anyone can‚Äôt force cooks work pandemic either. I‚Äôm everyday, day.

Why fuck can‚Äôt representatives same? fuck sacrifice sake others? house for. balance powers. can't let four states decide nation going. CA, NY, TX, FL. would happen.  Correct I'm wrong President, Trump power keep leaving power call back in. vote change exactly? chose live 3rd floor apartment central air? New Mexico 332 Covid deaths per million people, Texas 333. Texas multiple cities densely populated areas. Saying New Mexico done much better job Texas ignores data. ...aka heads roll! attitude Read. world wars shores involved got entire empires bombed machine gunned away Believe want, talking someone living first hand, wife first line fighting COVID.

The problem ""expert"" opinions lot experts lots different opinions. saying buy supplies 1 month strike stay home e.g. duration September. guess would wake 'em plus would probably curb virus quite nicely. realize there‚Äôs moratorium disconnections right now, yes? decided state level anyway.

You realize states same, right? 

In STATE, publicly owned utility companies prevented disconnects. City-owned disconnect and/or give extensions. like bacteria multiply. skip cold salads, reheat food order in, least enjoy sense normalcy. knew extremely rich guy went Russia type stem cell thing. early stage cancer wanted instead treatment. Died 2 weeks. Lol get wrong, Republicans scum. current system set tend towards corruption. Need rewrite rules want better outcomes future. Senate product slavery.

Low population slave states wanted equal footing.

Let's end legacy slavery.

Also, Wyoming 500,000 people 2 senators. California 40 million people 2 senators.

I'm tired held hostage redneck minority. ok. Unfortunately isnt big enough crisis wake Anerica up... Politics everything, politics touch everything. previously read coronavirus destroyed almost immediately heated boiling temperature, guys recommend 50 minutes. wonder shorter duration actually significantly reduced efficiency (like heat permeate inside mask enough), used 50 sure.

Also, cooker works, regular oven regulator set 100 degrees work well - cook two dozen masks arranging trays lined e.g. baking paper.

Ed. I'm gonna try bake couple old, kinda smelly FFP1 FFP2 (\~N95) masks post results

Ed.2 [Seems going 20 minutes, nothing melting changing color.

Ed.3 signs damage fabric plastic ribs inside. label bottom one masks collapsed tightened fabric around it, interfere wearing mask. Smell completely gone, although 25% ass 25% pizza oven earlier, marked improvement 100% ass experiment. 29000 deaths 23 days needs 1260 deaths day. daily deaths need come much. 100 can't really go outside

\*laughs desert\*  Mostly eat food, goes digestion tract cells virus latches to. assume stomach acid breaks apart virus reaches rest body. I'm sure people wish dead; apart game.
How self defense relevance that? believe right defend somebody brings harm somebody need; natural law. I'm going hate wishing dead lmao is, although places it‚Äôs winter based program. Cutnecks. Aww it‚Äôs cute think people still country. 

We don‚Äôt, haven‚Äôt long unfortunately. absolutely insane statement. west found oil become extremely valuable recently history-terms. I'd love piece together finding oil helped fun creation reddit. Bible say whatever wants people act it, Christianity systematically calling culling entire middle east. well I'm sure trying get started appreciate doubts! Good news people stay indoors social interactions reduce significantly winter help slow covid spread well. 

But point kind along ride vaccine. Buckle Kink shamer lol j.k. Hey, logical opinion racist, sexist, anti-intellectual reason! /s Idaho cases Oregon now.  calling national strike. Yup yup. also integrity. University Notre God Dame Gone Fucked reheat food different container, move on. I'm sure think 1/3rd deluded. 

Neoliberal democrats fine staggering inequality. Politicians businesses care things generate money them. realize there‚Äôs moratorium disconnections right now, yes? decided state level anyway. look up, I'm kicking catching it. Thanks new phrase. obviously problem living Sweden's high death toll. think implication either live save rent rent generate income addition rising equity. It‚Äôs time hold empty suits accountable. Enough enough. agree concept broken modern days.

Hell population difference original states? messed California versus Wyoming? white red? tbf, 'lol cook amirite' defence meat industry decades every outbreak virus turns quite nasty little bug, including have, lo behold, adapted resist anti-bacterials thanks meat industry pumping anti-bacterial meds CAFOs faster crush newborn male chicks hundreds.

the government tends agree: lol cook amirite? think we'll end cancelling Mardi Gras New Orleans, which, way, even happen *six months Katrina.* depressing. entire federal response fucked, states botched response, we're dragging everything out, increasing damage. hate this. hate country become this. hate selfish many people being.   drill. Time let Government know ""human capital""   isn‚Äôt saying this. FB friend posted this. agree said can‚Äôt reason people like whatever want like post considered political sub, simply stated fact. Thank consideration. one million right now. said that, Montana different tourism takes massive dip end August tourists see skiiers stay mostly self contained around resort areas. Although, think Tahoe probably much regard. Floridian dares visit us depths winter! Please come visit us things calm down, sure family would love see time right scenery going anywhere promise that! :) feel bad everyone. landlords tenants. know right roommate unable pay bills, would kick out. make enough support people. imagine landlords situation. already families support. can't people support. mean, much likely infected waiter talking customers ok fall, vote whoever incumbent. Fuck crew. needs federal government set mandates. least make wearing mask public mandate. federal government letting states want leaving individuals states helpless rule governors. reason Trump administration want get involved want take blame everything goes shit. let states decide wanted blah blah blah. enough. acceptable. Haha yes really republicans ones cave? dems could easily say 300 doable. But, they‚Äôd rather zero know. Overpopulation benefits many ways, supplying beloved corporations hordes desperate, hungry people competing low salaries/wages. [Good night! good luck elections! Hope things work everyone end. hope accept misstaken future. :)  ‚ÄúFall‚Äù Rome? I'm barber, least day, I'll hear ""We'll see happen's 'virus' election. going magically disappear, watch."" I'm Florida. don‚Äôt test won‚Äôt cases. People saying that. I‚Äôm hearing it. crazy. Thanks sharing make go hungry, eat rich. Well, combine selfish people (not everyone people,) incompetent government, widespread poverty large amounts people various health conditions, perfect recipe disaster. doe CDC even bother planning anything, more. know Trump preempt whatever plan, announce worst-possible decisions, tweet.

I expect decision doses stored single unrefrigerated warehouse Texas, distributed pony express only, warehouse pony owned one T's relatives.  pony die, none vaccine distributed anyone (other T's family) months. (Or, variation general theme, course.) True. current party without doubt making much worse. Dems equally blame? Jesus fucking Christ, fucking BULLSHIT. want real change, general strike answer. GUARANTEE house senate convene immediately hammer deal there‚Äôs general strike. that, demands endless. corrupt fear general strike means money flow stops. Money talks. sailing ocean blue going help us here? thing is, spend stuck inside. live managed get virus control, pretty normal summer save wear mask indoors public.

Literally need get go back relative normal wear mask, social distance, selfish stupid. easiest shit world. Michigan anticipating epic increase cases cause. Also visit resorts Mexico, Mexico really. Though Mexico City times (which really enjoyed). I'm looking data pretty clear. person visited resorts Mexico skewed positive look? resorts pretty safe. hear idiots, ""Oh i've Mexico, super safe, felt completely safe"" sure parts are... resorts representative country.  feed plants toilet water. won‚Äôt pass NY. deaths steadied past 2 weeks around 190 day FL TX. They‚Äôd need 135 days similar death rate reach NY.

And treatment getting better!
Now again, that‚Äôs confirmed deaths...TX already close 16k excess deaths. think hundreds thousands protesting month ago, handful protesting cities. seeing many post ""the public nine meals away anarchy"" quote told Congress still time pass something. 

I guess we'll start seeing nationwide protests now, right? Let ask question: think good thing people health insurers longer deny coverage people pre-existing conditions? mean...if elderly populace poor people minorities heavily impacted would clear lot things. job opportunities, social security, estate transference, etc. 

 evil cant they're doing. calculated justify something drastic? thinking half million isnt lot dead people time said done? calculus wrong. Glad hear they're masks! frustrating Dr fucking slap face nation‚Äôs citizens. Florida sucks cuz people. south Florida lot give. Unfortunately right they‚Äôre giving corona. 3 months....that's it? 

I words. mention twitter global platform, users could Australian, German, Argentinian know relevant either them, neither vaccines usual long term testing. Ditto believe meningitis.

But irrelevant you‚Äôve neither lol. hope got chicken pox child stopped testing. almost cases. bad mask? cable aint getting fixed.


What cable companies gonna do? Fire every single technician? Good luck Percent positive leaves lot room manipulation either way. 

Want show higher %? Focus testing high risk symptomatic folks. Want show lower %? start testing random factories workplaces previous reports symptoms. oatmeal! filling stays you, great digestion system. there's much it: BLM protests still happening. Clearly, people show large enough numbers things go ""national"". That‚Äôs America won‚Äôt socialize healthcare. 

It‚Äôs give Americans freedom rest world enjoys, that‚Äôs bad profits. tuition raised 5% probably. mothers swallowed you. case sore knees transition back gape mouth. New good luck. hope goes well even means seeing MAGA garbage around. There‚Äôs difference land state... let‚Äôs repeal 17th amendment people actually inclined give shit who‚Äôs state government Wish could recall every Congress person office. It‚Äôs sickening country sold big business. result decades current transmission rates virtually places, including US, 50% reduction susceptibility along 50% population would plenty drive transmission rates well 1 eventually eradicate know sure unlikely is, seem major cause infection. However reduce sources significantly enough, even low chance starts relatively significant. Also chance infection contaminated foods ways besides eating it; handling contaminated packaging rubbing nose eyes instance. recommended practice, let's real, people time. certain perks living alone, can't deny that. Arm violence literally option left. really. Ballotpedia lists average net worth senators $10M house reps $5M. would hurt work way little (like AOC first started politics) (and senators) even blink losing weeks $500k+ salaries. bad, missed that. read shit like truly wonder people realize world looks like outside they're from. still 1/3? I'd wager backed since 2016.  thats freedomest freedom i've ever see free life stay it. 

Politically executing people would come horror. Maybe start kicking America?  get vote Senator recessed Senate month, deadly pandemic, immediately millions citizens lost benefits income, without signing bill give relief entire country. hurt angry come naturally? 50,000k also fuck ton cases per day. It‚Äôs improved, long way go.  block people houses (Or something equivalent)? need make *everyone* suffer (like do), something impacts *them*... never said trailer full, said trailer overflow since beyond capacity. information two paragraphs ""six 11 bodies trailer"" line, title came from. purchased April purpose. stormed Bastille, palace, started chopping heads. There‚Äôs alternate well... smh

Autumn works perfectly fine  Sic semper tyrannus understand Senate works. It‚Äôs represent states, people. state equal representation Senate. 

The House people (and states) represented. course do. Compared neighbours high. think taken action beginning. would've liked made mandatory wear masks public transport Stockholm right now.

But need exaggerate like this. STRIKE! STRIKE! STRIKE! POWER PEOPLE! WORKERS WORLD UNITE! FASCISM! CORPORATISM! WE'RE SICK SH*T!!!! really annoying pretend ask questions back February March. 

A lot illnesses effected temperature WHO/CDC flat didnt know full confidence temperature effected Covid late April. Fauci even said something like ""i doubt still know. virus still studied"" asked it. 

It perfectly acceptable wonder things new. many wishful thinking fend nerves set minds ease. 

Reddit fucking condescending lately, swear every subreddit hints r/iamverysmart every thread. That's easy. Stop feeding antibiotics animals industrial agriculture, get GPs stop prescribing mild viral diseases placebos. 

Covid particularly bad pandemic. Someday H1N5 improve human-to-human infection rate, probably massive poultry farm, already 50% case fatality rate. Gamestop, video game retail store, defined ‚Äúessential‚Äù sell cellphones. guess means Congress non-essential? Dude like 6 companies literally everything US. GOOD LUCK. Mitch McConnell knows re-elected matter overwhelming lead despite incredibly unpopular, Kentucky still votes him. wear masks part spending virus. magic, know contract Beauty eye beholder. Good luck telling shouldn‚Äôt feel like it‚Äôs racist. I‚Äôm sure successful you. Gimme date. I'm in. difference largest smallest populated states 7x 1787 33x today. didn‚Äôt say aren‚Äôt protected three months *sigh* problem. Except believe partly true. Lots people gone strike long time ago I‚Äôm honestly sure do. waste day away computer working, playing games I‚Äôm not. feels like I‚Äôve lost months matter days, else even supposed do? Feels better drown fantasy world doesn‚Äôt exist accept world does. late. really hoping second stimulus check supposedly coming month... fear utility shut offs/evictions weeks away I'm terrified becoming homeless middle pandemic leaders come agreeable solution, meanwhile countries paid citizens stay home right thing do.

Meanwhile America, congress even settle giving us measly $1,200 more, months initial stimulus. I'm tired. want earth anymore.

3 family members contracted covid, 1 passed away. Another critical care people keep making politics.

Sorry rant. Destroyed exactly? Can't resell it?! Huh? McConnell popular, constituents always vote Democrat.  name one anti-science position Democrats taken? radiologist

Its ""low bar doctors""... type doctor. radiologist reads X-ray, CT, MERIs etc. Important things... infectious disease expert. Gotta remember death counts drop significantly weekends (like 50%). Going hit 1,500-2,000 Tuesday-Thursdays make 200k within 3 weeks. Nah, need send message. Sure can, go find house chillin like rest fucks. ain't red v blue thing anymore. rich corrupt assholes giving a.shit plight everyday person. We'd heads pikes already damn comfortable. probably tariffs maple syrup right now, corn syrup works fine though. Fuck general strike, let‚Äôs pay taxes next year see then. Would general strike mean go back March levels grocery store chaos guarantee I‚Äôll find food need? so, fuck Yea, that's thing hurts, seeing expensive studio apartments ""reasonable"" houses northern parts Seattle. actually got consider renting gets pretty rough unless get extremely high wages. Compared pretty much everywhere Midwest called Chicago, get decent homes really good prices. good know there's chance drop prices.

As far Amtrak, cool trip takes awhile. goofy say, really enjoy rides like that.

I'm still young although I'm pretty close 30, need actually traveling everything else want top getting Midwest. guess that's horrible feeling I'm experiencing, feeling going complete everything wanted do. live life gone back normal already people wear masks keep distance. Everything open again, people working. Less 100 new cases per day population 8.5 million 0 deaths days. 

If want go back normal get people board following guidelines. really, really simple.  tongue tell date, I'm onboard. **THE BEATINGS CONTINUE MORALE IMPROVES!**  Oh thanks bro dude, didn‚Äôt see clearly bro, you‚Äôre like, right man, it‚Äôs totally like sides. Like whoa dude tell man, like society problem too, like society live in? tried voluntary self isolation, work. Unfortunately there's always small percentage people give damn anyone else. Mandatory quarantine something take lightly, temporary restriction freedom movement minor compared cost human lives letting people whatever want. we're going it.

My brother wife kids currently mandatory quarantine flying UK. seen 4 years able talk facetime they're close really hard. know avoid health catastrophe. 2 weeks.  talking about? Senate arrested held McCracken 1934 using Sergeant Arms. SC upheld congress's ability so. absolutely nothing department justice. talking entirely separate power. Inherent contempt allows bypass Barr's DOJ use police (the Sergeant Arms) arrest someone. Nothing DOJ point. That's non-inherent contempt congress.

They. Do. Have. This. Power. used since 1934. legal precedent, confirmed Supreme Court. really wanted to, could. argument using member Trump administration always secret service might fight back could get messy (although legal precedent would entirely side congress). postmaster general member administration. There's reason allow he's doing. 1934 case corruption postal service, way. It‚Äôs company‚Äôs best interests protect workers, else class action lawsuit coming way. It‚Äôs shit hole going give go another shithole? Feels like still dealing 1789 1848 Senate formed continues give outsized power less populous states, making racist institution. gave slave states power based population, gives states worst policies governments equal power states diverse populations policies lead good economies.

States which, feature, enact policies hurt poor minorities drive people states power states policies attract people provide greater prosperity. That‚Äôs great article completely supports ‚Äúsocial distancing‚Äù idea. don‚Äôt need mask thanks gravity‚Äôs effect large water droplets. know isn‚Äôt larping right. Umm, someone say no? Dems signed way back May! believe supposed simply eat cake. I'd least like see full postal service strike. force Congress something. infections go low number, contact tracing becomes possible prevent outbreaks getting control. Soo can‚Äôt lower tuition people please stop scaring us? fuck expected do? What‚Äôs point writing articles like this? wear mask, sanitize whatever buy, I‚Äôm trying keep family visiting other. else fucking do? Yeah, keep making sound like it‚Äôs end world. That‚Äôll totally get people follow proper procedures caution. Seriously, expect us do? I‚Äôm sick seeing shit like everyone saying we‚Äôre gonna die fall. Can‚Äôt anyone even slightly optimistic? Even little bit? frustrating. everyone starts wearing masks today, common sense things, infection rate near zero end October.  key word ""everyone"". Yep, sure do! even put gravestone soon after. think Georgia guidestones talk population control. I‚Äôm definitely taking seriously someone downplaying things described. wonder telling people worry headlines like ‚Äúthe worst fall ever‚Äù harmful Ikr. I'm little irritable know 75 year old person severe asthma. keep wanting go restaurants people. They're sending anti mask vids. Etc, etc, etc True, also point. Americans unique lack , another commenter put it, ‚Äúcivil responsibility‚Äù combined growing lack trust government.  I'll open parachute start feel pain hitting ground vaccinations ""work"". 
The question safe they? put bounds it. least one case means it‚Äôs theoretically possible, Korean call center study high rise shared elevators almost cases 11th floor indicates it‚Äôs major cause transmission . Probably pretty rare. limit turns 14 days. link rules, mods sticklers here. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like covid‚Äù month bunch projects. Made lasagna sweet Italian sausage. Drywalled closet. Got way exercise.  Enjoyed  ‚ÄúIt is‚Äù I'm backing position data. one keeps screaming without providing single iota data.  We've known since February. ever get fever, typically low one last long. temperature screening would catch symptomatic cases, without question would miss overwhelming majority infectious cases. Stay safe ü§ôü§ô get paid $170,000 year bullshit. That‚Äôs awful. I‚Äôm sorry. :( Jebus. course mean it‚Äôs different everyone. friend got symptoms one day lack smell lasted like week Lol, missed 1 handle. prices insane. Valved 10 cent eBay surgical top day. Yeah thinking too. dont recall restaurant workers getting attacked asdaulted smoking banned indoors. People upset too. grumbled complied got it. Wait executive order Trump signed relief? really free, still pay copays, doctor visit fees, etc.

If going vaccine, there's copay doctor visit fees. would fall preventive care benefits Affordable Care Act (aka Obamacare) like vaccinations. eliminated 102 days. possible way simmering away secretly time. 3 days since reappeared 2 people infected already hospitalised. thousands tests conducted every day thousands random testing centres around country last 3 months without single positive result. introduced border recently. herd immunity even work COVID? screwed. People think special therefore take basic precautions.

Do also refuse put seatbelt know going crash comfortable? Remove brakes everyone else brakes, need them?

What qualifies make determination? watched Vice dick Cheney, really hammers point thing oil. wmds, American movies 80s oil. Yes. Lowest testing rate since June today. 25% positivity 10% pretty terrible.

Schools open Monday. many lives rumours conjecture save? 
 
One side cherry-picking data. Wait wait wait people going homeless yet going take break!?!? according article working issue 1 1/2 hours per day. fuck.....we going die I‚Äôm furloughed unemployment got denied food stamps actually savings. feeling voting mail would hurt him. Wow I'm surprised. Utterly shocked.

/S reference [Demolition person say anything ""all parents?""

No, not. Thanks I'll give listen morning I'd say world showing true shitty colours far since begun. ‚Ä™""I'd like say good necessary trouble‚Äù - best quote kid I‚Äôve ever heard kill virus laboratory setting, team heat **92 degrees Celsius (197 degrees Fahrenheit) 15 minutes**.  cooking kill it. surely put leave hold.  Unbelievable. Phew! close! never expected either. Username checks rapidly catching Sweden. Italy far away either.        
The columns sorted on. Sort deaths/1M population. We're approaching Sweden rate 15 per week.  rate we're going, we'll catch Sweden end August mid-September. multiple trials once, speeds process major mental gymnastics supporting people refuse help down. still think team? seriously?? appreciate explaining better. original statement made seem though didn‚Äôt believe science masks general. 

I haven‚Äôt seen experienced people aggressive wearing masks scenario, don‚Äôt doubt it. think masks important crowded places, especially indoors Nah wipe 300 million US Uh seems like GOP, rather foaming-at-the-mouth cult trump seems interested wearing mask. Get outta r/enlightenedcentrism nonsense Asia started using proven 100+ year old techniques control Coronavirus week 1. 
America less extent Europe insisted techniques work never worked (until proven wrong). 


This case forgetting, case massive disinformation campaign. Millions unemployed it‚Äôs like they‚Äôd worry time off. Note: examples social media...and Citizens United People also say less deadly Trumps war Nuclear Annihilation good stock market. America best inheritance rates whole world. Coffin sales never bigger. Fucking unconscionable. around 48% people pre existing conditions, counting old folks yeah, pretty much. I'm wasting time composing cogent argument deleted someone wants hear. argue children fools. Remain ignorant. understanding also...the lack heath-system-overwhelm wave hitting Spain mostly hitting young people, hitting Catalonia/Barcelona like way, way, way harder regions Spain -- e.g. Madrid's recent case count today 264, Catalonia 1964.

I'm totally surprised, given EU tourism opening Barcelona kind spot tourists. Shut fuck fucking morons

leave children alone  Yep. One nation, indivisible. 

I wish behaved team we're supposed be. screw everyone else, screw scientists experts, going whatever want decided take proper precautions?

Who get CBR prep response training from? Literally TEXTBOOK security theater ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Ten?

Good saying something, fingers crossed get safety measures deserve! They‚Äôd rather inject Lysol get vaccine comes think so. people always blaming ‚Äúthe government‚Äù they‚Äôre focused killers. 25% positivity rate 10% even good. going stop celebrating physicians heroes start identifying anti-maskers really - murderers. Lol insane guess see happens people food, homes, jobs anything left lose do. protesting (If that's do) get worse rate. folks fucking minds. WTF!? Check found FDA EUA NPPTL. Looks credible fake ones eBay generic printing wish team. doesn't. many times feel like volunteering needed help wanted somehow. sure hell would expect teacher take risks would children. one ever said volunteering sometimes forced based need. top that..what disinfecting going matter fresh group kids come in?   wait! There‚Äôs more! it‚Äôs literally key normal life

except stil wear mask everywhere go. One brave idea thier exposure risk well personal hygiene standards. us practicing safe behavior since start forced use less comfortable mask unless think exposed. well $600 2 weeks ago, literally nothing. $400 week? isn‚Äôt legal, states don‚Äôt infrastructure support it. soonest anybody gets cent september. yeah, $600/week nothing currently stands. hopefully Belarusians already set example we'd situation. heard suspended it. back school soon. Thank Gop Yea one National tragedy took lives many people due corrupt leadership. 9/11. Flip flop, flip flop dense, study labels masks. #2 box.

And telling real NIOSH approved n95 mask. counterfeit. read study raw data used make analysis. 

Then wrong much happy change position prove point actual data.

You even reliable data now, still insisting manufacturers respirators CDC wrong, expect think change mind anything?

Yeah right. Reread study brought understand it, go ahead let know n95 mask used study.

A proper study identify specific materials used. case, means masks. proper study masks claim(Which authors study disagree with) go ahead post n95 mask using.

Pro tip- able demonstration testing apparatus, test masks.

Seriously, qualifies keep telling experts wrong nothing actually back up? many places, teachers cannot strike. would lose teaching certificates. knew prognosis virus 0.5% ~ 4% IFR. 
So came much 0.5% lock-down would save people would kill came 4% would save millions. 
 
If better data China Italy could known better would required world, Europe particular, taken lot seriously lot sooner ... China asshoe. VOTE. cannot even understand study provided, want more? Why? refuse read claim supports whatever make been.

There reliable data study contest dude. said reliable authors study. need know claim be.

You provided reliable data contest, guess post data want contested?

But want keep claiming understand study masks/respirators claim, n95 mask used? reliable study test products like without identifying them. Take Congress, insert senate you‚Äôre getting somewhere. Seriously America, fucking stupid we? Halloween seems less harmful terms virus spread many activities. I‚Äôm tired shock obvious. truly weirdest dumbest timeline. area keeping closed December. earliest. I'm üíØ board plan, btw. also scientists telling us months ago wear masks I'm gonna keep eating popcorn watching things develop Monday August 24th team effort, failure fault one person whole team still loses.

We're height pandemic *so far* *The face make realize stolen election opponent eat shit daily dumb-ass.* 4,500 people dead? Sorry boring you? atleast felony right now. original statement ""The virus dissappear stay inside weeks.

You countered ""all evidence suggests otherwise"".

Places, including New Zealand stayed inside weeks, yet still coronavirus.

Therefore statement ""all"" evidence suggests otherwise incorrect. see people, see things. They're resources them. I'm even redhead (just reddish tint) man, finally getting dentist would completely numb night day dental anxiety. 

Turns numbing supposed make ""hurt less,"" supposed make hurt. knew? Chinese CDC recommends putting frozen food running water. want wash soapy water dunk new pool clean water, put running water. Well, widespread infection lot people virus...so higher chance infection every interaction. Masks necessary us.

Also, worked Hong Kong. Nearly 90% people wear masks they've 12 deaths. can‚Äôt imagine 12 cases ANYWHERE US promoting swift widespread action. *sigh* Infectivity severity complicated relationship. severe infections usually shed virus, miserable person unlikely go anywhere spread it.

But far population level control concerned possibility reinfection means entire concept herd immunity won‚Äôt work. America dreadful country children in. Let's clear. COVID-19 taskforce, Trump. lmfao. 100 percent agree, wholeheartedly. thank Bush that. carry small bottle sanitizer purse touch mask sanitize. also sanitize register put mask on. looked like her, I'd take every opportunity wear mask.

Sadly, choice garments shows little self-awareness. Wait holidays closer, suicides sky rocket. coronaviruses, Covid19.....

Which turn, destroying education system, no? Cause effect. 


Also, I'm saying ""you're smart sports"" I'm saying EMPHASIS wrong ideals. country upset high school sports canceled vs. using children pawns jump start economy point. 

And comes conspiracy theories, anti-maskers, disinformation virus. People believe whatever convenient get life back normal. point mainly sports events things running places. go club. dancing!!

Just keep closed. Fake news! u wrong guy bet Trump leave, escape multiple prosecution, spend remaining years living UAE. see photo? one running old rascist dementia?  Took words right mouth. pandemic weak af. engineered, need better next time, hurry it. Lol. do? ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

It good decision. see next Trump wins. saying. already seeing remnants ""the next Trump"" - Stephen Miller prime example.

I really hope right. Truly hope, 2016 election past 3.5 years shown, really thin razor's edge. fact even contemplating choice election talking like Biden/Harris good idea bothersome. also recency bias factor latest polls conducted, 12 point lead far think less packaging infecting people- everything I've read says likelihood picking Covid packaging incredibly low. ""snow"" packaging moved transport gets airborne, that's got virus it, infect workers. Seems like someone mask up. damaging, rather choose quarantine dying deadly virus. hundreds medical workers died result. Teachers need put pile bodies too?  NEED to?  kids die it? parents? Grandparents? You? number deaths deem time start shutting things again? guys wait summer, look like Canada numbers conserned. no. looking back???  accepting dying normal part life now???  Wtf wrong you? idea sources infection? Leave, dad  reduce concentration infectious particles n room. Yeah plenty data coming directly local state sources, even believe White House changing numbers conspiracy get plenty data sources. Ah, you‚Äôre racist hates Arabs. good day. That's mask comes handy  Lol joke. threat family. Everyone says feels like bullet arm, didn‚Äôt feel super weird take Tylenol reduce fever may true. least one study suggests intellect correlated legitimate question. coronaviruses norovirus provide immunity least 6 months. I'm worry much family, seems handled well far.

I'm worried source. It‚Äôs nightmare go inside, outside house. paraphrase Men Black, person could that. People can't. need kind change people agitating for, get people able that. Ok cool spread 100% unaffected severity? Lmaooooo covid football team, they‚Äôd cheering win title Collateral damage thing, maybe go move perfect country. Oh wait, doesn‚Äôt exist. you‚Äôre near terrorist hotspot get bombed, sorry action saved American lives. we‚Äôre talking population level immunity. Competing hospital beds American sentence I‚Äôve read today countries wear mask using public transport. countries focus social distancing since way effective masks wear masks. 
The belief masks beat virus seems American phenomenon. Yeah like already wary kids couldnt afford crisis made completely clear climate change going kill us 50 years. arent capable tackling level problem. Opening package cutting chicken releases lots droplets, hands cutting surfaces contaminated, need thorough cleaning. Even this, improperly handling chicken major cause foodborne illnesses like salmonella,, nowhere infectious. Telogen effluvium I‚Äôm pretty sure opening schools contributed ones shooting unarmed school children drones. Nah guys cool? ""Q"" likes this. people attacking sikhs walking street northern California withing days. Lmao shut up. Yeah I'm problem, guy gotten one day stupid pandemic working essentially 5 months. wear mask, follow rules. shit stupid I'm sick people like sucking Fauci's dick Half dozen, half population, difference Ooooo Warned huh? Taking mask talk like taking condom ejaculate. Sure, it‚Äôs good wearing rest time, you‚Äôre literally taking riskiest time. speak up. LOL. know it‚Äôs wrong, momentarily read Mayor Jenny Shattock‚Äôs name Jenny Shattcock. wondering, ‚ÄúWell. indeed?‚Äù take loud mouth opinions internet comments like matters. could see arguing with, would laugh face walkaway IRL.  


u/socomalol operates nofap mentality - [writing posts asking help masturbate explains trump lovers angry hateful time. beat eat cum dude, it'll help relax.   add context. People get tested less less people experience symptoms. Presumably he's talking fatigue. Yep catch Covid? react parents talk masks bullshit covid somewhat hoax general?

I want taint relationship kinda give vague responses. tried arguing ""my side"" (common sense/science?) always get extremely heated frustrating overwhelming. They're super passionate masks pointless calling people stupid wearing them.

I know silly take personally hurts handmade masks scratch takes 4 hours per mask (I made two alternate washing other) say cloth masks stupid people stupid wearing them.

We're page all. even wash hands coming home store/work. makes feel like wasting effort washing hands, wearing masks, touching face phone out, etc.  filed gig worker unemployment May. Still gotten single check. Every time call say ""we're really backed right notify soon get request processed"". can't imagine i'm one position.

Also, congress decided fuck another stimulus check, huh? actually follow. choose tested due symptoms going higher rate positivity. I‚Äôm allergic horses I‚Äôll sit one out. people realize combined power. actually banded together became advocates, could fuck them. That's like us divided distracted. need us need them. People still going bars California. One street makes sure sell $1 worth ramen noodles beer order claim selling food. need strength behind lockdowns restrictions KiDs pRaCtIcAlLy ImMuNe Whoever downvoted comment Steve Jobs may stupid, certain nutjob hate Trump administration. hate they‚Äôre borders. 

Don‚Äôt fucking dare assume support shit...it‚Äôs tragic affront human rights. 

My great uncle Jew Germany. never met government relocated him....it event began letter H. 

Maybe you‚Äôve heard it..

Not saying going happen now...but can‚Äôt allow travesties like even come CLOSE occurring. 

Don‚Äôt assume know me. 

Fuck you. factually incorrect. Please stop spreading falsehoods. [Boom boom ba ba ba boom boom boom ba ba ba ba ba ba boom boom boom bada boom They're scum ICU admittance: (You change start date graph see peak.

Deaths per day: (Avlidna per dag) peaked April.

So peak June? Testing increased June: (Swedish) 22: 36k tests done. Week 26: 75k tests done. Doubling tests done, lead cases.

Also new cases mild (""Lindriga""), mild cases, serious (hospitalized) decreased. serious cases also tested increase tests June. I.e category serious cases get tests June, decreased. bump serious cases. 


 Page 5. (Lime green mid cases (Lindriga). Purple serious/hospitalized (""Allvarliga"") 


There effect summer, summer house, cannot explain decrease since April. 


More people outside, AC common open windows). ""Many"" people access summer houses, sure many. far located secluded/alone, e.g. many small cities, etc. places popular. 


So yes, summer effect cannot explain all. Since probably wash hands eat, problem. probably want start practical use wipe hand sanitizer. school? would also extra cup water handy hand sanitizers nasty gets mouth LOL What's hilarious outspoken rude people like going quiet sooner rather later. EVERY SINGLE REGION huge numbers like died fast reached certain point. Every one them. yet can't see truth right front face. mention Oura ring? Soylent factory him. vaccine mean returning normal operations? get vaccine mean I'll immune getting covid mean it... Without reading article, let guess.

TLDR: Pandemic = Declining mental health. 

Am right?  know party rules country, green party. Guys, data bad looks.

Statewide, positive % trending down. R(t) still 1. specific areas, areas Stop Spread initiative, 2% positive rate. 

Overall, state actually well. Minus specific areas. part study. sick mid March showed strongly positive antibodies took test early August. Nobody ever said couldn't.

This whole thing started trying downplay US numbers useless whataboutism pointing towards France. feel like clever enough follow conversation *you participated in* mother completely ignoring lockdown. found last week June even bother wearing face mask, reason getting kicked everywhere. read ""The Great Influenza"" book constantly referenced many people levels society keep calling 'just flu"" tell flu always communist conspiracy viruses real, eating neutraceuticals healthy cell nutrition. flu actually caused flouride reacting 5G. God wish accurate true. Discovery organic takes time. Unfortunately people like suffering dying disproportionately definitely feel urgency. It‚Äôs scary Wow. didn‚Äôt disappear anywhere. thought flatten curve enough make go away completely unscientific. spreading places become lax. want keep numbers down, keep country closed. Perhaps missed entire point. saying matter comes stories meaningful, true false. troll bait. That's it. saying way even stories true would visible effect big picture numbers deaths.

I saying also attack aggressively talk verified sources, numbers, facts witho learn. might well yelling mirror. 

If go real world, start jumping people carry different view, part drives right left apart every year. would like think, tell one positive thing come post, sharing great information, changing minds, winning points... promise possible approach. Logistically, could see working smaller schools, high schools 3k kids more. Add additional bus routes school longer within walking distance. honestly think best bet wait there's better therapeutics vaccine. could gotten cases trackable, traceable level possibly could made work, current state affairs states, way. Also Arizona going record 38th day 110 degrees summer end sight, opening windows probably option. Fauci explicitly said cutting corners safety scientific risks we'll taking, financial risks, risks safety. compromising scientific Oxford vaccine, lead researcher‚Äôs three kids took April, Sarah Gilbert‚Äôs three children, 21-year-old triplets studying biochemistry, decided take part trial experimental vaccine mother‚Äôs vaccine‚Äîshe leads University Oxford team developed it‚Äîbut wasn‚Äôt big family talk. ‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt really discuss wasn‚Äôt home much time,‚Äù Gilbert told recently.

Ugh might get downvoted idc. Reddit, don‚Äôt kids. don‚Äôt understand. People go work. can‚Äôt watch kids day, need work. They‚Äôre going lose jobs houses don‚Äôt work. guys blame government, reality government simply people want: yes people really want kids school. Please don‚Äôt blame government trying represent that. reading post, I'm Bill Gates' side. true? pandemic known possibility. prisons really plan deal one? single one land nobody forcing go open. options, people either:

- care / believe real.

- convinced safe good.

That last one might leg stand on, gonna need mountain evidence otherwise guarantee legal loophole get around it. Lol I'm even American dunce 

No wonder guys always laughed lol real concern, IMO. COVID become worse immunity compromised cold. But, amount social distancing occuring significant less infectious diseases much problem COVID itself. every person claims voting 3rd party throwaway vote, actually voted 3rd party. 3rd party candidate could actually shot winning advanced 1918. hope never get numbers So...when organize eat rich?? real many kids died disease? None them? removing incivility goes hive narrative? post replied also incivil. round applause United States government. Star Spangled Bastards really country justice. Anger management thing. look it.  That's need-to-know risk. disclose virus. pandemic almost them. bet back like suddenly 30,000,000 renters get evicted. dense population would dense understand dense wordplay. know graduate students moving graduate family housing, I‚Äôm really sure undergraduates. think students campus, they‚Äôre generally 3rd/4th years live student apartments instead residence halls. noob question- 41 40? I'm sure week way better. üôÑ acquaintance anti masker ranted restrictions, blah blah, standard dope. 86 year old mom became infected. Now, acquaintance getting tested. Suddenly, mask advocate talks important wear one.

It hit personally real her. lack empathy core anti masker's beliefs? moron adopts whatever talking point hears first? I've never voted, would love vote flickers out. real success story Taiwan stopped pandemic tracks without lockdown. Conspiracy theories truths people difficulty accepting

Edit: know used polio vaccine paralyzed thousands years ago? Potentially yes. High mortality flu strains (up 60%) attack multiple organs. Flu also trigger heart attacks inflammation response destabilizes artery plaques. Wouldn‚Äôt great news Los Angeles. Saw increase homelessness since Eric Garcetti became mayor promised decrease homelessness. appreciate additions lexicon:) Yes. Here's deal, 5 kids demographic highest viral loads almost symptoms. Older kids considered ""adults comorbidities"". Then, studies show people strong antibody responses (older folks whose innate immune system task) worst symptoms, less caused immune response - cytokine storm, maybe ADE spreading every organ.

So, words, seems like virus inhibits immune response way, that's clinically cases ""mild"" viral symptoms usually produced immune response.

So hell virus inside bodies immune system ignoring (I say, part immune systme, since course immune features eventually clear much virus, least)? 

This kind thing causes effects line, cumulative hidden organ damage. Virus reaches immuno-privileged areas like nerves, brain, testes, lymphatic system ""hides out"" come back later (Shingles, etc.) So, really worrying ""let 'er rip"" herd immunity one stupidiest conceits age. actually better Canada, consider florida 20 million people packed space 1/10 size Canada. idea everyone wear fabric procedure masks protect others protect you. 

So exhale fabric mask spreading virus, contains virus location

if person 6 feet wearing fabric mask would low risk infection barrier contained face.



if exhale sneeze without mask let virus go everywhere, fabric mask protect you. thing protect N95.


if everyone wears fabric mask limit spread eventually ""disappear"". thats alarming rate infection wasted 7 months containing thing. US many ways 3rd world country cant compare. safe way. 

No one seems willing hard work required so. Everyone gets free chips salsa waiting implants. US many ways 3rd world country cant compare. Utter nonsense. feel brainwashed conspiracy theories? Hey look another fear mongering liberal doctorate virology!  2nd thought go back bed. sane people let know come out. feel irritated depressed due this, highly recommend taking break news social media whatever take mind like play games, watch movies tv shows (comedy might best) read. point felt completely hopeless even thought give dreams. decided stop looking freaking everything knew can‚Äôt much help. give doctors scientists time need create cure vaccine. glad awesome people spending everyday day get rid damn thing allow us live lives more. light end tunnel, get tunnel damn long, is. able meet friends things this. may now, able attend concerts go see movies again. 1918 spanish flu show way out. Hell even black plague ended, albeit resulted lots deaths due lack medical knowledge way back then, even ended returned lives. Yeah, went SD weeks ago family cabin brought toilet/washing/rest area us could enjoy time outside without presence people. Time start building public housing projects. Schools 2021 spring semester. Would possible move classroom somewhere else? know outside air dramatically lowers risks COVID transmissions, possibly factor. maybe local library? Conference centers used? went 60 daily cases 600 daily cases.

That's second wave.

Deaths follow soon. It‚Äôs nice see someone else least mention national strike. rich/powerful assholes fortunes working class. national strike literally takes money power away instantly. middle class makes country. 

The GOP continue use divide conquer get around this. Like others said, corporations got majority initial $3 trillion stimulus, gaul screw working class. Vote November. Antibody test used estimated 85% accurate. Think placed 0.8-1.2% fatality iirc. needs revolution. screwed me. Damn must suck say NZ GOOD response. managed reduce cases way *zero*, yet still ended resort lockdown again. Paid Chinese voters work see...

This China virus working overtime. alive 2016? drop vigilance SPREAD. evidence there. proof there. Think rationally. also confuses still don‚Äôt definitive answer question, 8 months pandemic

Based experience we‚Äôre moving much, much faster determining line(s) causation, preventative measures, developing treatment plans, standards care, clinical research, phase 3 drug trials vaccine research compared HIV. took years get public acknowledgement even existed.

If hadn‚Äôt gone shelter-in-place lockdown, adopted wearing masks practised social distancing we‚Äôd much difficult place now. we‚Äôll get quickly unless we‚Äôre very, careful regarding next steps.  mean, easy target make fun considering sheer incompetency play truly understand people go ""break"" vacations often. hell they're makes deserve time away something vitally important? let come visit you. mouth throat? receptors oral tissues tongue. sometimes wondered transmission occur way contaminated food.  Hahaha haha ha. WTF!? forget vote incumbents November

Edit: swypo Executive Orders toilet paper compared actual legislation. ""I‚Äôll anything prove theatres re-open safely,"" award-winning composer tweeted...‚Äù  No, think hypothetical scenario ""raises questions."" think covid denialists trying whip conspiracy theories anecdotes. America's dire straits can't even imagine things look like next month let alone next year. We're going bleed out. really give singular fuck, they? gas masks cops. stop tear gas particles, would absolutely stop viruses too. figured was.

This specifically try win November.

Sadly trick actually work cause people dumb.

Trickle makes sense puts money hands consumer directly money actually circulates. gives stress. well ted cruz ride horse 10 gallon Y‚Äôall hard mandatory vaccine dick. Let idiots die. wonder many families going evicted homes they're vacation? wonder many kids going go bed hungry they're vacation? wonder many people going end complete mental breakdowns next 30 days they're vacation? 

Most all, wonder one cares? next pandemic global warming heard someone say something similar told ""we government healthcare private hospitals can't overcharge us fees!"" (I sarcastic obviously).

We're pretty good species forgetting important lessons. I'm longer blown away stupidty politicians burocrats.

Replace vacation covid wave. virus particular? like need deal pandemic, destruction post office many things. Yes thanks bunch assholes Purell made Ohio replaced public school science teachers coaches so.... Holy shit, Americans fucked deserve money especially callus *since* start pandemic.

FTFY No, sadly isn‚Äôt. outrageous callous defiant people face obvious facts. happen get it? Someone know die? 6 months people still believe masks; single simplest method largely avoid getting sick. Plus get benefit pushing October so. suddenly 2 weeks election get $1200 another note Trump says ‚Äúyou‚Äôre welcome‚Äù Acropolis predicted everything. wish could agree. senate going 3 week vacation without passing relief bill American people absolutely fucking believable point. slowly fucking us reach breaking point. fucking USPS cripple voting system, there‚Äôs going hell pay end America going even uglier place live. Hahahahahahahahahahaha Thank you. i've super paranoid takeout far mostly can't find information deemed ""safe"". realize nothing 100% need understand science better trust enough. i'm high risk i'm infected want take risks great. good note i'm feeling much better i'm mostly eating food cooked home compared back March.

The goal get 100M end September. important point. numbers, need organization. mother and/or might die. Mkay. Idk think covid deaths equal American deaths fromm WW1 True worst thing world thankfully People getting complacent. best numbers country...but government opened everything people forgot pandemic going on.

I know get less physical activity home more. Pfft Japan pwnd Texas.  Layoffs going rampant institutions. may well lose mine one work at. Burger kings impossible whopper taste like sprayed burger grilled flavor propping straw man instead providing data claim want counter?

Just back claims stop trying change subject.

Let's see data labeled reliable author actually tests n95 mask instead apparatus study referred tested counterfeit n95 mask.

I cannot provide data counter data yet provide.  Calm didn‚Äôt get radical comments quite yet. Give another five mins start psychotic antifa bullshit.  SARS tough know went away fast, antibody levels dropped 2 think Ibiza clubs closed anyway already high enough measles making comeback, they're getting co-opted conservative ""Covid scam"" movement. They're higher give credit for, that's going problem. Damn, guess I‚Äôve progressively worsening case COVID apparently last 5 years so. long countries ban frozen food imports infected countries like US? actually liberal thing criticize america... conservatives pretty nationalistic late.. Things getting control went back statewide mask mandate pausing reopening including closing bars.

So it‚Äôs you‚Äôre implying. voted Abrams would governor. travel still perfectly relevant question - one coworkers literally took vacation Myrtle Beach like day came advisory list. lot people arent fucking understanding situation here. dude joey b led charge dems get board ""Death solves everything.""

- ~~Iosef Stalin~~ ~~Michael Scott~~ u/Cau5t1c Wash food! anyway. pay though. US healthcare system reporting record profits turned away far less patients away countries far less cases. well biggest voter suppression techniques modern history. could opposite, keep mind time things like constant Cholera TB outbreaks common memory. much glitch much intentionally done create false narrative things becoming, ""better"". Wish could! I‚Äôm vacation rn tho üôÇ

I know, know...it‚Äôs risky...to knowledge virus attacks you‚Äôre enjoying yourself. figure teachers take six months off, week won‚Äôt hurt. fair interpretation data cases rise, children infected. way lockdown helped slow rise, restrictions loosened, saw cases overall,‚Äù said Rosenstock.

This explained people. THIS. *EXPLAINED*. PEOPLE.

¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø  got nothin'. Hospital beds what‚Äôs important ICUs.

Rural areas almost half ICUs per capita Yeah... sadly. still getting worse. spread 4000 7 weeks really much dent compared 4000 dropped day.  curiosity, countries would say flat deaths acceptable level? Yeah I'm problem

Cheers honest it. like hot garbage back 1918? yes Eh, deadly coronavirus something scientists warned us long time. SARS MERS showed certainly could happend.

We lucky way didnt get even deadly virus. pandemic bad enough, need constantly invent facts every comment section make sound worse doomy. would probably say going good long run kills kids bad immune systems, would ended burden society anyway. Popular vote raw numbers, Americans want. *eagle screeches* Christian, American way.... realised posted wrong link country very, difficult situations. We‚Äôve Depression, we‚Äôve World War. pulled together 9/11.‚Äù

Why writer and/or editor trying (because simple English therefore would deliberate) make Fauci look like idiot know run-on sentence is? appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* alternative site? Seriously...not Facebook 9gag mean Keeps getting put back 3 months every month.

Next month early 2022. literally do? Yep, trying help people get woke trolling. going wild kids, see fellow peers, mentors, even parents dying cause schools reopening. They're paying 10 fold blunders current administration. Also add salt wounds, poor kids labeled paid actors many dont even know situation. people wonder pandemic resulting worse mental health amongst young population.... Thank you. OK, let's say concede 100% can't prove anything. win that.

What evidence looking evidence says weeks staying home make disapper? schools open. Despite clearly Covid everywhere. close someone tests positive, kids often don‚Äôt symptoms don‚Äôt get tested. know it‚Äôs it‚Äôs everywhere. open back theatrically cleaning. rate, give less year. Hopefully turn things around then. Depression, we‚Äôve World War. pulled together 9/11‚Äô

I'm sure Rome pulled lot things Fauci says people politicize coronavirus

They going stop should. lol weirdos....Man seen strange ass comments Reddit, dunno.... ticking towards city size Aurora. excess death total already there. hard wrap mind around. you‚Äôre trolly anxiety come back 10 fold. Mine shows physical symptoms I'm constant pain ears head lightheaded. 
Life miserable past two months. feel helpless. really wish people would stop using ""no evidence of... blah"" phrase. many people interpret ""blah happen."" Like beginning said evidence human human transmission. Sounds like Liberal Utopia. im feels like people wanting wear mask people dont like told it. know people wont wear simply fucks ego someone else tells something comply. Hah, Russian sucks, I'm learning. picked one step dad took courses loved drink whatever country came from. damage health. cigarettes in. used Interior‚Äôs place provide security. it‚Äôs DHS  *Danger Dan ""In August &amp; September, slowly start buying foods last like cans, jars, pastas, etc. actually said ""Don't go crazy, slowly build stash time entire country going hit, including states grow food."" 

What's point slowly? think buy lot supplies one week everyone copy you? better people like stock there's rest us there's run supplies? Countries like Spain Italy waaaay dependant tourism economically. Thats kinda major issue rushing stuff Biden put Fauci charge day one, I'll disappointed. child-trafficking? kids aymptomatic like said. proof, even though e comically uninformed OP reads this.

Again, saying ‚Äúemphasis sports means lack education‚Äù stupid. Doesn‚Äôt mean OP stupid, saying phrase serious manner is. fine vaccine, infection. shit leadership sure people sure won‚Äôt like way look front dozens people shit ventilator NYC comparable, wear masks rest country. well keeping rate down, too. Didney!!!! friend sick six months. terrible coughing bouts can't breathe blacks out. Never late! 33 started learning become theoretical physicist. There‚Äôs always time (until isn‚Äôt). Thanks clarifying. It‚Äôs social conformity. It‚Äôs freaking common sense. America soul, certain ever did. Maybe big, spread out, different. think push individual rights freedoms went far.

FACTUAL EVIDENCE completely blows uninformed opinion water. main opposition party not-so-subtly suggesting Govt knew outbreak long made public, increased messaging around prepared supply masks recent weeks. basically accused Jacinda lying us letting virus spread unchecked reasons specified.

You imagine conspiracy minded among us jumped that... side note, that's toast.

""na zdorovye"" (literally ""for \[your\] health"") used ""you're welcome"" used English (a reply ""thank you"")

Ah yes, back capitalising random words again; definitely emotional scared. Luckily steps mitigate one mitigate other. Unluckily aren‚Äôt really taking steps. Ugh, better another new mutated strain! Yeah, blame them. said, choice take care someone, risk dying severe illness possibility permanent damage, I'd simply figure something out, live sending someone cared situation like that.

I'm also glad make decision. Personally, I'm around age *should* kid, I'm glad that's something ever interested in. can't imagine child this, gotta incredibly rough. get dragged daily websites opinion. see could possibly important health wellbeing child. knew virus likelihood headed since January, whether wanted acknowledge not.

This we'll never get rid US.  previous strain? visited South Dakota, Wyoming, Montana last year. Coming New England, eye opening see spread everything is.

It may actually way, seemed like closest hospital might 2 hours away something, might still small facility (which would seem understandable).

Very different around here. Seems like must add variety logistical challenges, nothing else. It‚Äôs behind paywall, post article please ? Probably permanent tho game Covid either win die. bad Fauci sidelined orange dotard. point, he's history books. watet wet, what?!? Cooking denatures proteins. nothing interesting saying cooking likely denatures COVID-19 virus proteins, way proteins. that's saying adding anything conversation. 

The concerning parts steps prior cooking. many steps involved making safe, lapse compromises everything. problem twofold: 1. social media become strong part people's lives, 2. Social media flooded political opinions issues... 

It's question intelligence, really boils fact people becoming political every minor issue. get 170 new cases per day, bad Georgia gets thousands. sparse population prevents another Florida Texas Newt Gingrich takes lion's share blame current state politics.

The workers wearing masks, TV blasting Fox news, got lecture federal overreach daring ask getting REAL ID. 

These types never convinced. They'll go grave blaming everyone else, never themselves.  be, dangerous hard do. course based fact many aren‚Äôt taking precautions. forced schools reopen, people assaulted daily enforcing mask distancing rules, infection numbers/deaths increasing rapidly even though least habitable time year virus. 

The CDC basing statement fact ‚Äúpublic health measures‚Äù haven‚Äôt adopted held LOT idiots. one thing camp, another focus intently subject matter adverse weather conditions. kids we're talking about, already hard time focusing best situations.

I'd rather deal distractions home remote learning subjecting bone chilling wind freezing rain snow. Imagine office jobs outdoors well? not? school to, office jobs too. due drug smuggling.

Shocker, diseases viruses China flu US 2.7 beds per 100,000 people.

In 2016, US 2.77 beds per 1,000 people, 2,770 per 100,000 people. 29.4 ICU beds per 100,000 people.

Sadly, DeSantis chose otherwise. Let's see plays voters like me. wish could spam upvotes this!! I'll PM company website, call number answer. Deal?

EDIT: go, PM sent. embarassing you, btw. points 1 day ago feel like need reason learn &amp; without reason I'm blindly I'm told &amp; zero motivation learn. also... half country doesn‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs real nearly bad described. really don‚Äôt want mutate deadlier, bright side maybe people would start taking seriously it‚Äôs becomes potent quickly deadly? high standards society set myself. amazed people rationalize away concept system comprehensive, single-payer healthcare designed meet needs population instead generate profit. Sure, taxes increase, that's unavoidable, going pay less overall cut middleman private insurance. people happy pay private insurance companies actively seek ways fuck increase profits means ""muh gubberment"" forcing pay someone else's treatment, is, know, exactly insurance works. lol we're way far people make safe smuggling trips air without caught.

As numhers mention, true Idaho fewer deaths cases states also much smaller population. Proportionally we're starting pretty badly people anything stop (especially government), going get worse schools open. Assuming high insurance profit means covid overblown assumes insurance companies make profit helping sick clients. not. 

Insurance companies profit people buy services use them. motivation lies increasing fees denying services. also government subsidies, citizens paying insurance paying assist insurance companies taxes pay. 

For profit hospitals, thing. make money exorbitant fees nonessential procedures hospital stays create. Saving lives turn profit. furloughing laying staff avoid paying them. 

If companies (hospitals insurance) anything leaches, would expect record downturns profit period. Capitalism allow companies think greater good. lose investors profits drop. help anyone hospitals must show profit growth. horribly inhuman way treat healthcare. Fuck it. gonna take pessimistic timelines again, Fauci one guys darker end. Can't take far, I'm totally screwed life. [Robert Nobel Prize 1905.

Wow. dead children courtesy spouting that. Early pandemic remember people watching *Contagion* quite bit thinking people would taking things lot seriously disease like one (15-25% mortality across demographics). 

obviously better kills less 1 percent people far easier shallow people brush kills mostly old people. Poor people get hospital beds back alley. Oh economic one... one buy one get one free package Worse case scenero like bird flu, start mass culling pets. kidding. Outside Iraq particularly good. tax cuts led recession.

Ok good answer, can't even get people wear masks, seriously doubt world's governments competent coordinated enough ever pull anything like globally. Sure can, probably pretty bad. Getting another infection immune system battling another thing common thing often deadly. tell leave alone five times.

I stating views. certainly free comment posts. problem? dislike someone's response, downvote ignore reply. censor simply dislike say? lot health insurers started seeing profits recently decline elective procedures, forgoing routine tests potentially avoiding needed check ups. Immediately looks good carrier (as seen here). However leads significant ""pent-up"" demand decrease overall health population (both physical mental). Insurers want policyholders continue routine check ups preventing something happening far cheaper fixing fact. (Example: think free flu shots? Answer: cheaper pay everyone get flu shot is, getting paying people get flu.)

As hospitals allow elective procedures take place people become comfortable going hospital, expect see profits decline 2021 even longer pandemic lasting impact health population. Also expect see premiums increase (hopefully UHC increase reserves happen).

The max profit (1 - claims / premium) health insurers make 15-20% 20% need pay overhead costs, fixed costs fees. Usually final profit total &lt; 5% premium brought in. comparison industries (e.g. retail, restaurants, etc.) profits far exceed people bat eye.

The costs hospitals, physicians, pharmacies, etc. charge outrageous completely inconsistent place place. I've seen hospital charge $850 band-aid... I've seen new mothers getting charged holding baby right childbirth... disgusting. insurer middle man takes blame situation much bigger systematic problems play here. Could worse actually, viruses kill hosts slowly last longer pandemics. Surprisingly, see lot Catholic schools across country saying they're opening. doesn‚Äôt look like contract disease multiple times idea many false negatives would come 12,000 mail in, self swabbed, mail in, PCR Cov19 tests.

It's also fun note president passed social health care system forever one everyone acts like Hitler. Ok. understand majority things open Texas still many people wear masks...

False. Many food places curbside take-out only, and:

* July 2: [Gov. Greg Abbott orders Texans counties wear masks July 10: [Austin City Council Approves $2,000 Fine Mask-Order Violation End could go on, reality majority people cities Texas wear masks. Many stores require masks whatever local rules might be. That's keep saying, premiums going SOAR pretend know Joe do. even know.... probably remember anyway. Dude full blown dementia. remember reading Arizona day, like 800 cases 250 deaths, thought seemed weird me. roughly quote Richard Feynman, ""You used top students schools come everyone top. lot near bottom place never before."" Since start known infections December 2019, seen reinfections, except anecdotal cases possibly caused bad testing, dead virus remains picked tests immunodeficiencies. High volume, person schooling thing past I'm afraid. Turn buildings homeless housing desperately need. shit happened Italy countries, US.

Also, everyone forced send child school parents suck parents? mean week 1 school remotely teachers find easy see cps needs go check. One done. LOL! see thread Democratic Americans blaming Trump, Republicans still refusing wear masks cause think hoax.

You saw Republicans refusing wear masks thread? Really? think around spring next year we‚Äôll either thing really figured mostly rear view. Keep Fauci really conservative says (or maybe he‚Äôs like general don‚Äôt know) also implied chance get thing control year agree theory, outdoor school nearly impossible, least difficult, large schools. mention still regularly high 90's am. used food health wheelhouse.

A big difference Trump ACTIVELY making things worse.

A PASSIVE Biden means medical experts listened to. passive letting PREVIOUSLY ESTABLISHED SYSTEMS work designed.

It's definition insanity! thing say pay back pay well, hopefully whenever goes he'll get lump sum. GD  23.9% positivity rate today won‚Äôt wear masks, won‚Äôt use therapeutics..... would disrupt global food supply chain instead accepting minimal risk infection?

restaurants exponentially likely fuel spread yet they're still open almost everywhere. That‚Äôs still concerning considering population. Thank you, Doctor! Cool!

That's loooooong time. Curious: warm-weather states winter cold flu?

The north obviously cold winter people stay inside more, hastening spread indoor gatherings. south summer really hot leads indoor activity, right?

Anyway, obviously opening schools continuing open economy spread everywhere. I'm saying need specify talking premade food dismiss ""cooking food proper temperature"".

When make food, person handling cooking me. cannot infect food anything currently have, fear breathing onto cooked chicken infecting COVID-19 - infect it, already virus, virus can't infect it.

The concerns infected restaurant staff potentially contaminating food valid. they're different concerns buying chicken wings might COVID-19 bring 165F, disinfect hands prep surfaces may on. important conflate two. Fauci needs talk more. Trump touting around much Biden said plans work him.

Fuck scott atlas. Trumps new ""yes sir"" dr. hired Monday trump claims he's working administration weeks.

He even qualified fauci. He's radiologist. play profession low bar doctors imo. There's also fact lot people going doctors/ hospitals get procedures done fear getting/ spreading virus. people still paying premiums insurance provider, profiting premiums paying much cover procedures would regular year. 

Large Insurance providers also took massive PPP loans offset costs treatment clients get hospitalized covid issues time. spike cases South Korea 50.  think must busy job follow news much. teacher's union this? Sars mers can‚Äôt cause reinfection. aren‚Äôt confirmed cases later debunked Yeah, believe me, evidence. awkward, wondered big guy going jump later (but nothing happened). bit shocking usually talk strangers, this. 

TBF, possible woman pretty hard life. certainly looked like it.

The CDC director president must talking two different countries named USA contradict other. /s I‚Äôd take Russia‚Äôs vaccine another lockdown restrictions.  Thats wild write book Ironic think back late March April, re-open protests started, many people repeating mantra: *the cure cannot worse disease*. do? Half-assed cure brilliant combo opening early FAR many people taking mitigation efforts seriously. result barely made dent disease, six months later still fucking up, schools. point I'm pretty convinced way going get right, going happen, question bad damage said done.  could smart it, much ask. So, none politicians sociopaths, thinking makes one sociopath. Riiiiiiiiight. 2021 lot people care anymore really see return normal regardless whether safe. 

Do really see Disneyland closing end 2021? really see people going Halloween? 

These things happen. shoot messenger. Well, unlike hepatitis airborne novel virus, global pandemic it, boot. delusion able avoid catching virus short moving Siberia live pack wolves, living kn95 mask rest life. People around want follow social distancing mask guidelines properly even weeks, let alone 5 years. tell think survive this? Gates trying make available everyone $3. CDC really known economic predictions it'll interesting see plays I'm knocking government all. They've done great job far tell. I'm confused people would think Covid going 'done' New Zealand new cases long. thing never done get herd immunity one way another (and vaccine reasonable way achieve that) in-home day care asshole parent dosed toddler Tylenol spiked mid-day 103 fever climbing. Called called, answer. sent text saying exactly 10 minutes send ETA I‚Äôll call social services child neglect also falls child abandonment. I‚Äôve never gotten phone call quick life sending text picked fucking kid within 30 minutes. People assholes. Schools daycares serve makeshift hospital wards days don‚Äôt want bothered parent. never really tried control surprise me. hanging Internet like this?? never removed anything lol smoking still answered questions. Schools world daycare facilities parents work 25 hours day make ends barely meet lucky. hear ya. see places properly spacing tables, go there. But, I've eaten bunch patios/outdoor seating summer. places really good spacing tables. But, 15 positives Wednesday, county population 900k. worried, school starts back up.... Ah yes, floor floor. holding back in-school classes rest year elsewhere many parts Illinois. governor places value people safety evidence means scientifically proven it. Literally next sentence, guy. kill millions goes away. shut 3-4 weeks (which back March), we'll get 0 cases. listening scientist end pandemic. Lol.. funny one way putting it.. 

I born Valley, near Mesa area. Lived hell damn long. Escaped Northern AZ, far enough still hot Summer. Current plans involve moving somewhere arctic circle lol. Norway, Iceland, Greenland, Northern Canada. 

Yeah, folks moved Midwest (IA/SD).. definitely acclimated like yours. weird.. 

Idk get used feeling flesh crisping air singeing lungs working sweat dead ""Winter."" job sit day lol, dont work do, got enough money saved start business, waiting strike know what's going COVID, I'm going sit back &amp; chill. I'm posting random shit today. One theory I've read since started spreading wartime first amongst soldiers, worst affected soldiers pulled front lines infected rest population. worst strains selected for, rather against.

I'm sure science behind theory though. Mitigate can.... like wearing mask social distancing? Silver lining: COVID precautions work equally well flu. Get vaccinated, wear masks, wash hands. sociopath you. made everything yourself. trust believe basically saying. realize head right place. people literally believe virus real, there. Yeah might do. husband trying get unemployment months. online state website name wrong. called ask going on, turns internal system name wrong totally different way. called again, weeks later, find still hasn‚Äôt gotten money, turned wrong address him, too. 

Apparently order fix name, call department labor. (This explained recent time called, like week ago.)

In order fix address, needs prove address actually address, providing pieces official mail group sends money. Fun twist though since handle finances, bills name.

So, leave us? Somewhere cross section Creek Totally Fucked. we‚Äôre state that‚Äôs supposed *better* shit! partner teacher naive. protocols prepare shit hawk heading way.

Please, keep post mind months comment back. forgive you. So, 3rd official state/city that's needed refrigerated trucks dead? First, New York, areas Texas Idaho.

Good fucking job. psychosomatic, would many people report relapsing decided recovered enough return normal activity? psychosomatic symptoms caused ""thinking true manifesting symptoms"" could psychosomatic many people longer think ill, relapse increasing activity?

There's also lot people flabbergasted symptoms persisted ""thought"" covid last 14 days. psychosomatically create symptoms even think remaining?

Would also like point initial infection traumatic long haulers. Many thought flu, never hospitalized primary infection, even asymptomatic. 

If believe long haul covid psychosomatic, still means people suffering. Psychosomatic mean pain symptoms real, means medical cause. doctors still testing based reported symptoms rule possible medical cause.

This definitely good point need clinical trial specialists here. metrics, success would based percentage improvement standard clinical outcome metrics vs usual care RCT.

To add point, Johns Hopkins say rna viruses high mutation rates result several slightly different versions viral genome made time viral genome replicated. creates viral population diverse genomes, known quasispecies. viral replication cycle, differences accumulate original viral genome progeny viral genome.

 far transmission goes US, surface transmission something worth worrying about. We're seeing tens thousands cases day surface transmission..

Keep mind.. New Zealand seeing cases 100 days nothing.. that's surface transmission that's good reason worry UNLESS New Zealand/Taiwan pretty much eradicated sources. Unless 4000 concentrated specific period time held period 7 weeks give impression 7 week period therefore insignificant... Name one country built slavery genocide. need better tests. people don‚Äôt go way drive site, get swab wait results. 15 minute spit tests done entering business school.

Now tell us people dying something else! spelled ""freedumb"" incorrectly. grandmother way, don‚Äôt know education system related older people tricked conspiracy theorist youtubers

Youtube problem think demonetize youtube channels promote fake news, I‚Äôve never seen twitch promote fake news conspiracy theorist Literally thinking It‚Äôs thought happened conditions brought world war 2.

Only sickest soldiers sent hospitals, infected many others. created feedback loop caused deadly versions virus flourish. 

This, coupled fact soldiers moving around world shortly infection made recipient disaster. I'm essential worker never received hazard pay. PTO extensions speak of. extra money have, bought pandemic supplies, extra food toiletries needed them. Even costs tipped accounts wrong direction.

Oh he's cheating, there's too. Surface transmission possible, particularly hygiene low.

You consider possibility surface transmission low guidance handwashing one message seems stuck everyone.

Thus far, appears surface transmission manageable good hygienic practices. keep up. Still waiting call.

Still... unhuman way possible. I'm basing opinion data efficacy valved N95's stop exhalation droplets. better data please share it.

Edit: experience another appeal authority. either data backup position don't. you‚Äôre still unemployed due Covid, 
every state drawing Federal unemployment money FEMA‚Äôs Disaster Relief Fund next week ($44 billion available). funds used $400 additional Federal unemployment payments. 

In addition state draw CARES Act Coronavirus Relief Fund ($80 billion balance) pay state unemployment payments. 

If state provides $100 extra match Federal benefit required law, beneficiary would receive $400 plus state‚Äôs weekly benefit. States use CRF fund $100 cost share.

If state want provide extra $100, Federal payment would $300 long state pays beneficiary least $100 weekly state benefit.

Depending state runs program you‚Äôll receive either $300 $400 extra per week. 

After weekly new jobless claims reported today approx. 15 million people continuing unemployment claims. 

Running numbers $44 billion remaining DRF, fund 7 weeks extra $400 payment, 9 weeks $300 extra. 

The payments would retroactive August 1st. divided since start, though. Minus healthcare Well seeing electoral system nearly every level broken shit, it‚Äôs pretty understandable.

What I'm getting that, logistically, impossible parents anything *but* send kids school. government, especially jackass like Kemp, coming provide help crisis. they're lucky, enough income pay private tutor, costs LOT money likely budgeted year, would really cut corners elsewhere. there's help coming government, parents can't logically anything send kids school lest lose jobs, responsibility falls schools *absolute* damnedest protect kids. Right now, they're not. They're operating business usual. They're gonna get someone, possibly one *children*, much dead.

Look like this: kids school, guardianship temporarily transfers school. Legally, major decisions still come parents, terms adults responsible well-being child, that's staff faculty school, ultimately answer principal finally, superintendent schools. school due diligence, kids risk, two fix it. 

If teacher fixing problem, principal step reprimand them. principal fixing problem, super reprimand him. super fix problem, needs criminal liability. shit fucking criminal.  happen day last package expired, lost job insurance (last day month).

## Abstract

The development vaccines SARS-CoV-2 would greatly facilitated identification immunological correlates protection humans. However, date, studies protective immunity performed animal models correlates protection established humans. Here, describe outbreak SARS-CoV-2 fishing vessel associated high attack rate. Predeparture serological viral RT-PCR testing along repeat testing return shore available 120 122 persons board median follow-up 32.5 days (range 18.8 50.5 days). total 104 individuals RT-PCR positive viral test Ct &lt;35 seroconverted follow-up period, yielding attack rate board 85.2% (104/122 individuals). Metagenomic sequencing 39 viral genomes suggested outbreak originated largely single viral clade. three crewmembers tested seropositive prior boat's departure initial serological screening also neutralizing spike-reactive antibodies follow-up assays. None crewmembers neutralizing antibody titers showed evidence bona fide viral infection experienced symptoms viral outbreak. Therefore, presence neutralizing antibodies prior infection significantly associated protection re-infection (Fisher's exact test, p=0.002). together effective. US selfish afraid trust eachother accomplishing events like near impossible. tried that, struck down, IIRC. Pretty sure GameStop fucked. ""won"" losses unacceptable 21st century. situation see people fly drones willingly drop ordnance American citizens. Doesnt seem like significant decrease even. Something bootstraps. hilarious part middle lower classed republicans parrot rhetoric getting fucked over. would prefer getting trebuchet yeet rich. daily acts guerilla warfare streets! ignorant vast majority money went.

Try looking breakdown allocated Right, except instead mob smaller, uninformed, they're cost-effective way control larger portions population. need spend much need convince 500k instead 40 mil. Yes! immense amount rage dumb. Dumb people taken over, it‚Äôs like they‚Äôre everywhere! much access information makes us intelligent, yet people choose remain stupid. don‚Äôt get itttttt!!!!! agree. semi secretly wish Pence would get well (die) President Pelosi months.  universities literally getting sued students shity online courses test one person there's 25% chance could hit 100%. ""Niko cousin"" 3 months know sure. mean longer. we've able prove Senate adjourned today Sept 8, House already left won‚Äôt go back work Sept 14?!? think need break?!? Yea, I'm Freshman college PA county wasnt hit hard all, classes going person, time got changed online.

It absolutely sucks times get sad wont living dorm first semester, really feel bad cousin goes D1 college soccer, nationals last year, going last season college, that's gone. don‚Äôt think Trump caused us coronavirus.... speaks thinks, honestly doesn‚Äôt make worst president ever.  people really knew read left trying include stimulant packages., you‚Äôd truly disgusted. Honestly wasn‚Äôt Trump would $400 unemployment people. Everyone wants blame Trump look around person congress making choices! actually go government page see what‚Äôs really stimulus package asked return stimulus package denied. Yes many people population bother care. want someone blame. honesty believe person Trump! worry, instead reasonably paying that/just closing temporarily they'll lobby remove hazard pay instead :)  Boomers mildly lead poisoned positions power. Using worldwide numbers misleading considering counting population developing nations test report anyways.

You think portions India China testing reporting cases causes death? That‚Äôs laughable. CCP blocking numbers week 1 India resources much country test report. two countries alone majority earths population isn‚Äôt taking consideration smaller countries. Even US plans lower testing less cases/confirmed deaths, quoted president himself, announced public recorded.

You literally proved bending ‚Äúfacts‚Äù make feel safe suit narrative. Wake reality even doesn‚Äôt make warm fuzzy inside.

How US Figures? 167k dead 382 million. That‚Äôs 1 2287 people died FAR, even lockdown summer time reduces transmission. doesn‚Äôt take consideration live life altering consequences either. fall hits without lockdown expect numbers grow exponentially.

Why think lot educated topics concerned? assuming intelligence it‚Äôs clear don‚Äôt background epidemiology. researchers created video demonstrating method. note heat must dry heat -- water added cooker, temperature maintained 100 degrees Celsius 50 minutes small towel cover bottom cooker keep part respirator coming direct contact heating element. However, multiple masks stacked fit inside cooker time, Nguyen said.

I don‚Äôt know cooking yours, always liquid involved, dry cooking indicates. valuations $50 B-illion dollars. people controlling much 80% people think. 

That's like 12 people US. really think specific 12 people control entirety TV, print, radio, etc.?

Even do, suggest here? Give control companies founded? think solve country's problems? likely. tests basically formatted parrot answers. maths, apply taken given numbers putting memorised correct spaces, basically. 

this huge part students enter university hit dawning realisation idea study effectively learn solo books material... requirement uni. freshman curriculums unis 'freshman skills' elective (the name varies) basically exists sole purpose equipping students skills, happen public, private, grade schools. class required highly pushed advisors steal tuition money; noticeably prevents drop outs pushed new enrolments. wrong. 

I even think understand wrong point, admit it. I‚Äôve seen similarly worded posts social media well, drives insane. Argue it, simple follow precautions, they‚Äôll shame ‚Äúliving virus‚Äù. Sigh.. state less bothered actually widespread antibody testing like NY here. I've family start get annoyed me, mind no-compromise situation. lived life normally, likely I'd die Covid? No, not. even risk it? worst thing happens stay home next year, it. apparently thought extracurricular activities harshest punishment people conceive, way they're reacting think they're asked kick puppies small children Pretty wild California power almost every state combined House. Weird works. Yeah serve constitution, government, argument made military role suppressing civil revolt illegitimate government. Sick shit system mix elite live area start

And is, nothing population numbers personal opinion. work nursing home every single day check forehead scanner it‚Äôs always 95.something several people I‚Äôve seen get scanned says 93. occasionally I‚Äôve seen people get scanned says like 99.3 I‚Äôm wondering actually since part reads 95-96. think showing homes refusing service aides effective.  Remember, Congressman never orders food dry cleaning, aides pages stuff.  learn names start refusing service!!! I‚Äôm saying they‚Äôre dumb, I‚Äôm saying they‚Äôre negligent Seems article Harley decided even sponsor year im sure even youre casual grunt would give pause ordered fire crowd Americans.

smile r/agedlikemilk print Right! fucking joke! We're losing thousand people day coronavirus loser King worried fucking hair. I'd say save ""General Strike"" energy Trump refuses concede election results. Come on... twisted way, impressed. America. Yup, said ""Alright, we've done collaboration.

Yes, they'll use crowd control such, moment drone strikes ordered targets US, much military would simply refuse. would also death public support government country. 

This police much military hardware now. Well yeah, technically once.... would happen? Hard say. need free employers

FTFY. feudal class system country. powerful tied literal life shittiest job find. you‚Äôre one lucky ones get one full time job afford health care, probably STILL can‚Äôt afford house family. played ourselves. allowed modern version slavery take deep roots, convinced happy that. real tho. hair longest it‚Äôs ever life.

Schools reopening probably nail coffin, [especially seeing what's happening plan move back US things turn around, friends countries well. best friend moved back parent's farm somewhere Montana too, probably safest us all. know right? Another sheeple bro, like, wake up, man! keep making one man, see deeper issue country. mentality attitude ""fuck you, dont tell do!!"" regardless president is. barrack president time, people would openly defy anti mask say ""fuck you"" government. bush president. Shhhh. smooth brainers dont understand logic. think 2 + 2 = 5 No... America supposed greatest country world. Hopefully November say again. Well person posted Georgia    wireless retail stores.

House return September 14th. beginning month, husband got slight cold. tested negative dreaded covid, work trying force take 18 days addition five days took recover. forced charge PTO since covid pay covered company covered seven days. 

We really worried bought house. going making money 18 days took opt PTO charge afford pay back (he gets 2 hours PTO every paycheck...). 

Luckily shift manager called bullshit, since tested negative, symptoms completely gone, mine, forced take almost month charge PTO. 

His boss even said forced husband charge PTO stimulus stuff expired... fucking shitty. Oh, bad. Stayed even though getting learning experience. Air traffic controllers strike what, 20 minutes government shutdown ended?

Ive mildish symptoms going 5 days now. Low grade fever (very randomly) first 3 days. fever yesterday today far. improvement symptoms.

Just wondering symptoms peaked far severity. lips god's ears, mate. there. many countries locked ""a weeks"". get reopening plans taking account asymptomatic carriers. someone asymptomatic, reliable thing would test. 

It seems like businesses ignoring lot basic facts coronavirus. get difficult they'll go business unless reopen, they're forced close due outbreak, put worse spot stayed close developed alternative plan first place? think quite grasp vaccines work, would make 'vaccine insects'? Plus bats. Cats dogs get too, example. 
You'd need make separate 100% effective vaccine (no thing) every species get it, inject every single animal. literally impossible. though? :) may common knowledge, countries US use temperature checks, [like handled virus least well anyone else has.

I agree ""public health theater"", popular form theater, even people know better. Yes, really much stop beginning control. social distancing still way better masks would make bigger difference. you, want use less effective way.

There city US comparable Hong Kong comes crowded. Social distancing pretty much impossible wearing masks great idea. Considering still investigating, probably come forward authorities inside knowledge virus started spreading NZ again, eh? Interstate travel within US also banned matter explained how. Yeah think way win voter suppression, truly hope he's going get away with. approval ratings abysmal right confirm 

One neighbors held kid back year ""he would bigger better football rest"". 4 years older me. I'm 5'2 almost height.

RNA sequencing hopefully make clear. terrorists won. A, World War say? American economy didn‚Äôt drop 32.9%. Troll elsewhere. Please tell expect sources reliable. NZ? I‚Äôll believe easily people calling hoax. However, leaders protected guys virus quite well, making everything happening seem like another world, one don‚Äôt experience, hopefully won‚Äôt to. honestly hope ones calling hoax aren‚Äôt forced change minds (in NZ, everywhere else better effing change mind). everybody clapped feels optimistic, many anti-vaxxers Yup, misleading title be. Reported. I'm starting think Idiocracy documentary made time travelers. Glad didn‚Äôt jump conclusions. seem approaching smart way. necessary. use PCR ancient DNA too. means copy it, copying itself. Ding ding ding Back may people saying countries low infections could open danger. pointed opening allowing travel relatively low infection zones would lead less contol clusters pop increased spread again. told countries responsible TTI would make sure never happened. 

Well, are. Turns people stayingnin one place madenit easier control amd shut clusters people moving makes lot harder, TTI not. Herd immunity natural infections already terrible, untenable idea. Reinfection puts misery. Problem solved. Despite confusion, know use ""despite of"" yet don‚Äôt know subreddits rules editing titles. Perfect example shouldn‚Äôt walking around looking shame people ignorant slut. Interesting. wonder author rounding up. Sloppy writing science/medical piece case. mean definitely right, 99-100.2ish considered low grade fever everyone.

My baseline around 97.4. get 99 worse someone baseline 98.5. blBut I'm saying 99 still fever regardless ignored. Yeah let's talk real doomers. people downplay risk make fun us trying avoid spreading deadly disease. begging World bank give loans? hell money? one trust China. another pandemic time assume complete faith science advancements politicize hell this. Russia may done human challenge trial. done political prisoners back day. 

If case data efficacy maybe good poor safety profile. standard russian approach everything: high efficacy group low safety individual. May good war pandemic. Refusal wear mask = pro murder hate break you. Therefore side anti murder. political? 1 side clearly wrong. agree education vs sports, thing concerns many people refuse think. blindly support anybody ""R"" name. Even candidates openly oppose things hold dear. mean could vaccinate bats creating vaccine-insects eat. 

Or means.


Would probably quite unintended consequences hey, like current human civilization around long enough matter. Works hard lose weight.

So say. Many scientific studies say you, voice internets lol, wrong. body fights every second every day never stop trying get back set weight. Within one year, two max 80% people lose significant weight gain back put more.

If links scientific studies prove losing weight keeping easy, whole rest world would love hear it, I'm ears! write book become instant billionaire? LOL Good riddance  Well then, stop. Yes, Reddit, you. ""They currently owe $4,000 electricity company, moratorium ends next month.""

This crazy me. somebody rural Midwest lives house size shed light typical monthly electric bill? would like 4 years worth electricity me.  New York City state? Flawed statistics. must factor age discussing mortality rate.  Nevermind kidney issues, brain issues.

But still, desire reopen international travel means one country leak, they‚Äôre trouble much hate bars. Covid LOVES bars. we‚Äôre 8 months without issue though, likely suddenly become one? Homelessness, Deaths, Pain, get worse fall. people surviving without unemployment? Right, like middle east... Since much much 9-11 BTW... Killing thier people thier soil. Makes wonder crashed little towers? maybe?

Btw right. nuke vs invasion specifically:

Since 9-11 we've killing people thier territory, deaths stacked ~300,000 thier civilians, ~200,000 ""combatants"" (who, maybe large portion protecting thier fucking country armed bastards killing thier families?)

Source: know got keep US-Deaths:Foreign-civilian-deaths 1:100 ratio... consistency. valedictorian colleges throwing scholarship money hand fist. Swedish way üòé taken two ways

1) cdc exaggerating 

2) cdc warning  government ? still catch mild case still spread immunity like elderly vaccines often work well babies arent vaccinated yet.

Basically true, firebreak style, herd immunity protects vulnerable may work covid. elderly young immune compromised may always risk. time tell Anti-murder? Wtf talking insistent Korean protestants church, mean? can't believe loud Korea consist 20% population.......cults included. true. It‚Äôs become political election circlejerk. Idk, empathize someone scared admit might sick covid continue going out. think malicious. posted translation. quick.  Ok you‚Äôre troll.

I author post quoting from. Look username. look username person made statement. me. Need get chlorine 4ppm. don‚Äôt use conditioner n water , feel could drink emergency chlorine right , also simple carbon water filter wouldn‚Äôt hurt . Even though keep dogs water bowls full, drink pool every day several years , seem alright ! work sheet everyone‚Äôs temp check info single person 95 degrees.. doubt accurate. everyone around 91 degrees... wearing mask wont learn directly effects them. I'm even sure prevent winter crashes theory. 4 wheel drive helps *go*. Winter tires help prevent winter crashes help *stop*.

But winter tires go car, whereas buy new car different drive system, way less sexy commercials safety winter tires. think COVID19 ultimately lies sweet-spot eminently alarming illness kills one four, clearly clinically severe average flu. 

You people seeing scaled potential damage virus higher mortality flu along people incapable thinking beyond a, ‚Äúhey 99% people survive it, I‚Äôll take odds.‚Äù

Of course that‚Äôs entirely misguided number obvious reasons, that‚Äôs what‚Äôs happening right now. 1 hundred doesn‚Äôt sound scary individual level, scale virus capable infecting 70% 300,000,000 people along uncertainties long term complications, exceedingly serious problem going ignored insignificant portion population. 5% difference statistically insignificant.

Actually it‚Äôs roughly 6.5%, generally considered statistically significant. Glad changed tune vs encouraging people go NYC beginning calling travel bans racist Honestly you‚Äôve strict lock since March I‚Äôm happy you. Please check like coronavirustx wanna see cases still rising shit. 

Too many states aren‚Äôt taking seriously, it‚Äôs going hurt everyone. straight lock federal down, could 100% get check 2021, it‚Äôs gonna happen till gets worse. 

Shit Texas even trying open schools, Never even moved first phase months ago never properly shut shit disrespect meant anyone, would known woman title article caption.

I remember back controversy athlete genetically woman, due genetic variation lot androgens system life, like woman, never would known woman looking her. Well that‚Äôs case dems using power grab power... want keep everything shut let people leave homes leisure. saying it‚Äôs wrong move, clearly they‚Äôre power hungry republicans case. video, evidence. Don‚Äôt pedantic. Everyone knows right now, I‚Äôm saying article clearly relating getting flu shot. headline not.

And you‚Äôre ‚Äúlaughing ass 170,000 dead? worries. feeling death number drop weekend. get governing beginning next week saying things improving. rinse repeat next humpteen weeks.

M disinfect everything multiple times day, dowse hand sanitizer lives 3 days outside body. smarter average person. High school seniors taking notes right now. college you‚Äôre looking bullshit like going virtual, shows don‚Äôt care student‚Äôs education college experience. apply colleges least making effort stay open, taking people‚Äôs money running. also looking pretty serious hurricane wildfire season. Woo-hoo! GOP politicians holding letting virus rapidly burn people another month come back September say ""Look! Fewer cases found we're going shell money people all.""

Get November. clearly give shit people dying give shit people dead. /fistbump far Northern Maine. :-( Answer question!

Again showing entirely driven emotion rational thought.

The question vague answered specific meaningful way. know everything, one does; includes you.

The real facts these:

* say people asleep, yet link websites known agendas.

* clearly scared many things, mostly reading misinformation seems.

* fear mongering: ""You attack! WAKE UP!"" ""You doomed!"" etc.

These quotes conspiracy theorist. Even right (which doubt), ever convince people saying they're asleep. Well, think way. Schools open, colleges resume, people start really feel like things normal, denial. Halloween hits, people go trick treating spreading disease door door. bunch idiots visit grandparents Thanksgiving, kill go Christmas shopping meet again. bunch old people die new year, cold nobody wants social distance outside, nobody enough savings due poor economic conditions Summer usually makes entire year. People go hungry, can't heat homes, get evicted, can't find work, get sick die.

America done goofed. Better slap /s downvote count go way hell. see reason would be. Found guy sleeping class know. glorious. a) people want drag thrive chaos thought living global disruption b) people like moving goal posts. Wait vaccine turns wait BETTER vaccine turns wait EVERYONE vaccinated Sounds like adolescent me. Falls way down. go full hermit. generally safe go outside, wearing mask hardly chore (find ones like, colors/patterns/characters/logos/art enjoy). 

Shopping impossible, use discretion, pick hours less busy look stores bit way. Outdoor attractions, there's lot open space visit/walk around. 

Yeah, sucks able eat restaurants/go bars/go movies safely, order out/go park, see there's drive-in nearby. miss partying friends see technology offers. son started Dungeon Dragons DMs game using Twitch. 

Life still lived safely bit planning coping changes needed. I'm also ohio, roommates (who vote different people) line second polls open 3rd. No, need worry Covid fall, gone summer. heat bad it. bad. avoid political comments.

Outdoors mask drops risk close zero. 
Some people take mask yell peoples unprotected eyes get sick even mask. rare. ‚ÄúWork set free‚Äù plot thickens. 

My wife's coworker friend tested positive COVID-19. wifes co worker want get tested Sunday. wife exposed coworker. sorely pissed quarantine additional days fuck business coworker get tested right away. coworker symptoms. want email wife's boss tell get tested today get results end weekend plan accordingly.

I biggest client onboarding company next week. especially economy, come often. don‚Äôt Facebook tv. points 1 day ago feel like need reason learn &amp; without reason I'm blindly I'm told &amp; zero motivation learn.

Let guess, little brother using account something lol? This. Fucking mate love Dr Fauci, think he‚Äôs wrong here. boss taking temps rectally since pandemic reliable says is. Yes I've saying thing. northeast, lot big, indoor congregating places still closed, open minimal capacity. Come winter, they'll stay closed, stay reduced/reduce further. spread less (relatively) becuase less places congregate indoors. We'll lose outdoor dining outdoor entertainment suck businesses people well.

And completely agree, we'll anecdotal stories families celebrating holidays hanging together home causing spikes. overall, think mostly going long, boring winter northeast. We're gonna really cranky. 

(To clear, fully expect outbreaks think disappearing come winter, forsee catastrophe northeast cold. Plus, us actually good governors, so...) makes wonder Biden gets elected 100% mask mandate goes effect, people respond. headline replies makes look like cdc already saying fucked
 
You though. got 170,000 dead lmao looking account, he's leftist troll. FML. people never die due terror attack. still fight terrorists.

But fight terrorism. outsource pay people never die car accident, still rules safety roads.

I separate complaints roads, that's give fuck like wearing mask staying inside, really give zero fucks. behaving months sake infecting others, might die will, example, lose sense smell get brain damage, U.S might deal medical bill, literally shows kind person are.

If months, fine, far six months, end? yes, kind person. mean much people know. introduce onset multiple deadly hurricanes ravaged planet? Yeah, climate change isn‚Äôt killing anyone. Wow. /s.......? whole point memory cells matter circulating antibodies not. abstract: ""Memory cells secreted IFN-Œ≥ expanded upon antigen re-encounter, memory B cells expressed receptors capable neutralizing virus expressed antibodies."" body quickly mount immune response exposed virus, memory cells would recognize time neutralize infection take root. Antibody one markers. get mine free every year - good health insurance. I'm still mad CDC downplaying threat early advising people wear masks keep traveling.  could happen yet, think worst states like Florida Texas maxed around 20% positivity rate, almost sounds like arbitrarily set 25% figure end goal schools would never close. know can. take time get there. Preventive measures field strength confident get there, unfortunately late many. lot dumb people quite frankly feel empowered voice opinion today‚Äôs word. may impolite problem telling someone low intelligence. need return listening experts. various strains Influenza viruses survive longer outside hosts colder temperatures opposed warmer ones, helps spread colder months either hemisphere people also mostly tightly packed indoor environments poor air circulation (like schools).

&amp;#x200B;

Covid shown able survive air surfaces longer period time warm cold environments influenza counterparts, helps first evolved adapted effective temperate climate around Wuhan, China, meaning adapted spread warm cold temperatures, studies needed topic. I'm student would willing join sake everyone. vaccine e prevent hitting number. 300,000 dead end year 20,000 - 30,000 deaths month far eye see. Yeah bro they're blowing way proportion killed 170,000 people. Talk exaggerating fear mongering single dose. I'm 25. That's whack. April getting last snow. remember April 1st snows surprised. currently turning shit show university providing tests may come contact known positives. told isolate. already spreading one campus apartments. Tell Herman Cain‚Äôs family. Rebekah Jones lunatic. Find reliable sources. Yeah, got mine walking Walgreens. Pharmacist came jabbed me, left. make mean South Park episodes though. 
A pandemic, election 2 new consoles? everybody forgetting ManBearPig... lot eu countries banned Sweden outbreak

Turns sweden favor None die prove anything. Neither seek internet validation.Do data provided.

If looking specific data use google like normal human compare yourself.

DON't expect people research spoon feed you.You grown behave like one.

Edit: brief look history.Ah Swedish person. sorry beloved country bundled covid response.

I mean definitely sucks 5-10 X deaths / million compared neighbours.

Currently deaths per million:

Norway - 48Finland  - 60

Denmark-107

SWEDEN - **572**

wow. 


edit 2 : someone hellbent technicality missing bigger picture. Imagine dying, paid see fake breasts women despise you. getting downvoted? totally right father, supremely nice man albeit he's morbidly (400lbs range) obese, 70yrs old.  gets he's toast.  fact around mask bothers great deal gets dies, truly wonder anyone would feel remorse. page recommendations?
Western info definitely useless, outright inhuman evil. Well, actually stop told stop. That's keeps dragging on. Thanks global warming, worry pesky winters much longer. fact, thanks terrible policy decisions, clinging past halting change reduced chance future all! Enjoy Rapture! Nice sidestep. Downvote want, wrong bias palpable. nice day. That‚Äôs problem isn‚Äôt it? didn‚Äôt infect everybody else would happen let Darwin kill all. think fact since fall soviet union, seem forgotten world 30 years ago, international travel something wealthy. father, whose parents wealthy, went Europe teen, mother, raised single mother, still never been.

Yet am, 2020, coming upper middle class background, whereas dad minority people traveled internationally beyond like Mexico Canada, one college buddies traveled world. Shit, think absolutely everyone besides current roommate traveled globe college (he worked ton prepare hell law school).

Once pandemic ends, hope figure need remember international travel really privilege treated such, right people know spend time traveling home Hope changes Nov 2020 ‚Ä¢ Marylin Monroe I'm sorry, friend. I'm definitely position offer suggestions resources, absolutely empathize you. say know life forever, hollow is. know help all, can't try remind someone shoes.

Be kind gentle yourself. Biden isn‚Äôt going suddenly change mind million citizens think masks hoax lol. Coronavirus shit show matter helm. That's still important that, effective vaccine, lot people receive it. vaccine confers immunity, surrounded people also immunity (instead none), reduces risk contracting virus.  Yeah. first time read headline thinking season. Really speaks state current affairs mind went scarier meaning first. Covid slow mutating strain unlike flu. attributes. easily find info. did. Excess death data shows 60,000+ reported. passed 200k  yet, rather raise MTA fare working class instead taxing billionaires even know closest station is.

Thanks lot advice! talking countries discussion, irrelevant. Bald guy here, finally something covid don‚Äôt stress over! Fall grace appointed Postmaster blatantly saying trying stop mail-in stopping funding news: Water Wet Oh true. Well, politicians literally mandating go health policies. know school districts Florida offer person classes? One district tried get away distance learning first month person governor cracked down. even people want right thing, mandated wrong one. 

That said, factors listed may main ones, certainly help consider high wage earner I‚Äôm 15%. I‚Äôm also going guess don‚Äôt kids don‚Äôt understand costs associated them. There‚Äôs still struggle. no, don‚Äôt live lavish house massive luxuries. Shit costs money. fact locked parents inside permanent quarantine (with end sight) sadly they‚Äôll probably die quarantine.

Dude least feed them. Jeez. Exactly. 170,000 people died, let's dramatic. Try panic. reputable climate scientists saying anything human extinction coming world near us. pressing problem fail anything climate change *because* many people believe we're already doomed. probably turn super dead man super miserable weeks man  Fuck vacation, remove office Nobody reads mutated way. It‚Äôs pretty damn simple. Look it. I'm 100% but.. falsetto? understand fire danger. Sparks proper camper start fires. Happens every year here. 


Always plan lowest common denominator, oregon control everything, said it'll pay us long run I'm cool it. I've knees, patiently waiting sweet trickledown now. I'm sure it'll come sooner later. would suggest watch least one video documentary Doctors mentioned. start something. People often get disouraged, exercising seeing results, take diet consideration.
Whatever condition is, likely improve, diet improves.
And I'm fat shaming anybody, I'm also nice polite sake nice.
Obesity serious problem, something people change, want to.
And take anybody outside motivation. also depressed, somebody says something like. motivate start changing life.
I hope helps. moving thousands evacuate storm?!

People really evacuate Cat 4-5 (maybe 3) going hit them...if hurricane large, slow moving location would subject sustained 100+ mph winds huge amounts surge/flood many hours perhaps whole day passes directly you...look aftermath hurricanes past - Andrew, Katrina, etc....you want anywhere near path (which usually get solidified 3-4 days ahead best) Fuck it, I'm down. Ok. I‚Äôll weigh in. It‚Äôs unpopulated it‚Äôs wildly alarmist, generally experts think . ‚ÄúHow fucked are‚Äù, pretty extreme considering...here it. H1n1 different virus. atacked healthy people caused severe immune response. Covid generally attacking older immune compromised people. makes better though. Everyone know going years long fight, vaccine medicine managed. It‚Äôs never going away. However, Even it‚Äôs 50% effective (they guessing 50-75%) offer immunity lesson severity symptoms. faith man! :) lmao, day late dollar short, speaker. sure hope senators enjoy well deserved summer vacation. disgusting... October Surprise anyone? hell election fair square, way Nixon win fair square convincing Vietnam work peace took office cost US American lives. engaged treason, provably absolutely. 
Get back history books goober, got lot learn.  ACA literally written insurance companies. helps keep people calm, reason vaccine development gets much coverage. Honestly, spend less time sub. sub focused worst aspects situation much hope here.

It sounds like already need protect others. need check daily hear 100 ways things fucked. Flu vaccine poor comparison, effectiveness due educated guess prevalent strains flu season We're aggreeance friend. Love firefly well.

We actually moved back rural area nature got good time river summer. informed wife though drastic nees grid day woods decompress. Leave phone car wade river hoping catch good fish...or lol So... since funding meant covid-19 related expenses, take necessary precautions prevent spread, plan pay uh... um... working overtime towards herd immunity? fucking ludicrous, absolutely infuriating poor front line workers. Nurses, grocery store workers, fast food workers, ups, fedex, usps still busting asses midst high risk catching bringing home families still show work every single day. unemployed absolutely fault many cases lost jobs can't even work one watch kids. insane can't even give people extra money deserve human beings 1 year however long pandemic may last. 1 fucking year can't give Americans comfort financial support deserve.

People always come first stimulus bills dragged God forbid Americans, many hard working putting life line DAILY fucking paid least dollars hour even comes nurses others medical field. people deserved raises live comfortable life pandemic happened can't even provide worst pandemic century likely see. 



While politicians work hours day, low risk ever catching balls actually go vacation????? joke. Get fucking old asses back figure something out. deserve vacation job ALREADY fucking vacation compared real jobs playground recesses month work, 8-10-12 hour days. fucking sick. Help people. still ability choose leaders

They chosen private corporations called Democratic party Republican party actually  companies deliver appliances drop appliances door Covid. may accident America poorly coronavirus response.

In Fahrenheit 11/9, filmmaker Michael Moore mentions Trump would need dismiss Congress usurp control national disaster epic scale. Enter coronavirus pandemic, invisible 'enemy' utilized instill fear chaos, shutting economy eventually mobilizing military civilians. course he's already done Portland.

Parallels America's failed coronavirus response drawn Reichstag fire, manufactured events dire cause people behave reflexively stop reasoned thinking. Congress abandoned public today without assistance helps Trump's argument Congress longer effective performing duties. Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Senate longer concern us. received word Emperor dissolved council permanently. last remnants Old Republic swept away. re-elect.  get news like this? Please use word ""lockdown"" unless leave home special identity card allows buy groceries go doctor, way Italy South Korea.

If American, ""lockdown"". go walks bike rides, go store time want, even see friends park. probably lockdown eventually beat thing, done yet. I'm sold! way good news? always knew would degree immunity. Three months almost worst-case scenario. surveys state obvious pointless China begging world bank give loans? No. doesn‚Äôt. means immunity lasts least 3 months. could 6 months. 12. 5 years. life long. 

But three months sure. since haven‚Äôt seen re-infections last seven months so, pretty sure last longer three months. That's great investment! Especially monthly mortgage payment. I'd likely buy house, pay loans, pay Master's pocket, buy car, still probably 600-650k leftover. Even without 600-650k leftover would massive needlessly pessimistic. first pandemic, neither worst.

Things return normal next year either way. big Canadian news outlet ran opinion piece explaining Kamala Harris would great pick (assuming Canadian) lead Conservative party. going nearly sealed environment people breathing air long periods time -possibly infected. need go real respirator eye protection anyways. wearing mask relatively brief visit going sterilize environment magically. can't rely others protection type situation, honestly situation nowadays (though it'd real nice employers helped providing protection). 

You can't control random nutbag does, ensure done protect self. includes pepper spray.   Senate House jobs never meant full time jobs. supposed regular person year go serve Congress months. 

A Congress recess vacation, meant back district. really want multi term Senator lived place represent years time? job working produce 40 hours week even I‚Äôm verge mental breakdown almost daily lately. shit hard, can‚Äôt imagine much worse unemployed families depending government assistance government, fact, won‚Äôt shit it. thing really gets knowing legit globally thing together, us suffering one way another. Unless you‚Äôre living completely grid case envy you.  Really hoping CDC taking ""better safe sorry"" approach due lack data rather due definitive data immunity lasts three months maximum. Like said evidence masks work clear evidence masks *don't* work, look evidence *do* literally true evidence. 

I'm guessing used three months guidance researchers found antibodies disappear three months. think Phase 1, Phase 2, Phase 3 testing is? Hm.. high hopes lol. think current admin care deals making inner circle gets richer, I‚Äôm synnica it‚Äôs good thing, think numbers...they fall everything else. best numbers. top good  want Christmas Ragnarok. lockdown hard probably won‚Äôt wait till end 2021 feel semblance normalcy.. i.e europe, new zealand, china, vietnam.. etc.. unfortunately think it‚Äôs late now, let‚Äôs hope vaccine come sooner outbreak restaurant; next going suggest super spreader event church choir recital :P plus population hardline anti-vaxxers problem fast-tracked vaccine. 10-11 year olds would able stay home. technology troubleshooting something goes wrong? English isn‚Äôt first language? handle at-risk kids?

It‚Äôs complicated question without good answers. Except 25%, IMO, good answer, truly bad one. Maybe it‚Äôs I‚Äôm outside looking in, seems like america indeed process collapsing....  Genuine question: president executive order something like COVID relief? people still going downvote anyone says reinfection possible? seems pretty clear-cut. 

Two weeks ago r/coronavirus mantra ""anyone 'reinfections' never cleared disease hung around 3 months!"" Everybody unemployed (20+ million?) money anyway, might well go general strike. They've left us choice. hell getting paid much money people starving losing housing? mean I'm sure organized strike action comes call, sustained strike... One day show force likely. case, lot folks position describe call sick (assuming people health insurance benefits offered thru work also sick days) fucking legislation passed???


This March, Senate sat rather picking even debating it, despite Dems' saying negotiate Democrats pass $3 trillion coronavirus relief bill despite Trump‚Äôs veto threat

So that's talking new stimulus bill. overall, there's Democrats passed nearly 400 bills. Trump Republicans ignoring them.

I'm going walk back criticism you. media horrible job making stuff known. admit Dems passed stuff knoew, I'll take back anything bad said you. need side here, save lives save Republic. PA here. thing. Zoom call last night year going go. school virtual program, signed that, it‚Äôs completely separate regular curriculum. They‚Äôre trying can, guess, still. phone call today assistant superintendent, mentioned social distancing masks required conjunction per CDC, apparently schools they‚Äôve modified one other. WTF?? internet, ya idjut.... Lighten up. Confining people sick precedent even democratic countries. done protect healthy. many TV shows episode potentially sick people quarantined? commonly known concept. duality baby.

I firm believer overpopulation issue; often need realizes sometimes need throw somebody boat save life raft. much doubt dudes going strip clubs pandemic take many precautions catch virus No, I'm going ""proud country"" born here. embarrassing. countries leave constituents hanging thread.  note, date significant testing (8/10) tested football team. uni announced random testing next 3-4 weeks given specifics. Eh, started WWII government froze wages keep people switching jobs higher pay. Basically, men fighting overseas, demand labor super high. mean prices acquire labor rose significantly. pushed inflation, bad uncontrolled.

Instead offering higher pay, companies could offer 'free' healthcare. stay competitive.

Not regulatory capture per se government policy created system. sad reality, wrong. People sitting asses, physically exerting heart attacks. I'm sure he's wrong. Trump said going go away. Like miracle going disappear. What's like living doom gloom. well beyond point ballot pull change anything. need something shock system. absolutely ludicrous US starts announcing state results nationwide election every state voted Gerrymandering crimp idea public get choose still realty, really wrong, even wrong average American. Bet won‚Äôt strike! cry hear stories like this. know N95s widely available ways make surgical mask much better. would certainly help lot cutting transmission lower inoculating dose. \*laughs 98% re-election rate\* Ok win. I'm going call government tell let everyone quarantine open borders. I'll direct families dead tell freedom important loved one's lives.

Trump right idea, lets lift lockdowns let virus 'wash us' bask glorious freedoms. probably right, I've seen many stances make cringe; even agree conclusion (for different reasons). pandemic shown havoc neglect science bring (other cool toys porn). 50% minimum vaccine approval. Data overall effectiveness known yet hence trials. comment made unlikely highly effective 98% effective vaccine. thought masks social distancing worked, prevent someone virus spreading someone else? 

So grocery store worker asymptomatic (from someone coming day before) .... wears mask socially distances days people WANT store, isn‚Äôt exactly we‚Äôre now? There's theater (that plays, movies) hour away, mom trying set something whole family go October. understand told circumstances would going. Even get infected, die? likely not, even take chance? Teachers much likely vote Democrat.

The Trump campaign's election simulations likely show kill enough Democrats November might chance. Hence policies. Also purging public schools staff strengthens case privatized for-profit primary secondary school, Administration pushing since day 1. also actively working cripple US Postal Service right part strategy eliminating threat mail voting. I'll pick another part points -

What fucking legislation passed???

How fucking politician appearing TV help people health insurance can't pay rent lost job??

Your argument would stronger made factual obviously lost discussion. Thaw pathetic person are.

LMAO ü§£üòÇ teach part ethics course? ^/s Since cable companies care offending customers? They've got pants around ankles bent every month. call radical haha  Extrapolation year current rates current guess uncounted deaths, frustrated guess. know it‚Äôs CFS short-term fatigue? think there‚Äôs way know. also got medical appointments get cancelled them. Like me. made like five six doctor appointments got cancelled. Instead last one made. lucky even cancelled. mom's appointment month likely going cancelled too. this? Aug 28th? Sept 1st? Aug 28-Sept 1? sign car insurance don‚Äôt know much liability going give discount. start getting wrecks remove discount. would feel sorry people rates go up, I‚Äôve seen shitty drivers denial it. event require much direct action sacrifice majority Americans 9/11 did. us sat asses military deployed. even senator‚Äôs grandkids going school. Kids gov ? pushing hard. should. aren‚Äôt, it‚Äôs shit hell yet want reopen schools expect continue?

If anything even alarming. says profile invite PMs. PM again.

Also. posting multiple replies. That's harassment. Don‚Äôt know eventually Trump right go away? 

/s Yup, skeptics still gonna skeptic.   Yep are, live Indiana whenever get city one wearing masks, are, wearing properly. Even statewide mandate (that enforced) people walk store masks pull chin granted access. people posted US already reached 200k. assume true 1250 deaths day 3 weeks sounds plausible. is. 

Negligent mass homicide behalf republican party is. Maybe nationally see states band together it. wonder translation would medical advances. Back then, 195k one month equate bad April? Could worse teleported back 1918? Funny, America special stickers people driving 16 (Caution Student Driver). /s correct. people want work day comes. crazy cycle  victims of?

Exploitation via poor working conditions low wages. post about.

Your contention get better education thus better job. may true individuals - know firsthand shitty convenience store job left go college. contention (again) foreseeable future need *someone* jobs, therefore people also exploited. individual solution. 

You correct economic pressure automate yet.

I agree need educate apartheid withdraw comparison. last relief package session. However, optics McConnell care. Apparently thinks abuse country still re-elected. He's got millions care. fact guys even pretend concerned election year appalling. despise needles, lot years, skip flu shot that, fucking around year. wonder there's way get hot oil bloodstream. look that. really sad re-read make sure serious. stupid shit people say far that. even getting flu weakened COVID Everything know based real-world observations, unethical expose humans disease prove disprove transmission mechanism.

And observation real-world transmission we've opportunity observe, found clusters based fomite transmission kind: public surfaces, food, object shared people. lines know kind virus: fragile environment, even though fragments virus detected surface long exposure, imply surface could ever infect anyone. trying come culture-based test determine whether sample could actually reproduce, still development, PCR testing detects tiny fragments well detects intact virus. Actually science statement ""there evidence x, "" strong statement make. findings science provisional evidence. Yes, I'm saying get control people defiant going defiant future. (Cocking shutgun) care. care freedom, truck gun bad. Cabin fever thing, nowhere near big problem getting potentially fatal virus.

There occasionally weeks Minnesota winters go outside unless (polar vortex, I'm looking you) going sucks, adjust time.

The time becomes really hard spring late, days planned getting outside planting garden can't happen. bugs you.

You go outside winter want - still safer inside virus, help get able sit together eat.  Try new winter sport. Well least stop going Brazilian bikini waxes every months nether regions gonna smooth eggs ‚ÄúWe‚Äù collective we.

It‚Äôs horrendous. Even survive Covid damage lungs let‚Äôs flu go apeshit follows Covid. 

Not enough people talking Covid basically primes obliterated influenza even mild coronavirus symptoms. US typically doe? Lol get it, get it. Nothing said change mind... thats fine. Thats reason country great! Nobody wants see delusions. biggest face palm area letting every county decide individually they're going person classes not. - sense make kids one county virtual learning kids 5 miles road another county going school person? 11.1 BILLION dollar annual budget, would thought someone may said.....Hey idea....lets put virus petri dish counter watch microscope couple hours see lives tell world wear gloves ,pa Aqaq1  disinfect everything multiple times day, dowse hand sanitizer lives 3 days outside body. smarter average person.

I'm gonna save case ninja edit...

But that, foreign friends, US fucked least next three months. big danger huge number selfish, idiotic, assholes bother taking basic precautions 3 4 weeks, are. suspect lot places fudging numbers want pace way Universities open little flak possible..

I'm speaking student. fatigued hell two weeks exposed University health center made log sleep, tested AIDS hepatitis instead giving damn covid test. $900 later none wiser sick broke. Finland things note: retail industry surged soften blow, one large factory closed big car factory country (couldn't get parts), lockdown particularly strict long, Finland probably best readiness world switch work home, service industry big compared others. Also unions quickly ironed temporary legislation avoid permant layoffs, people worried losing jobs.

All change fact heavy industry drag country bit moving forward.

But point Finland seems things went well one could hope terrible situation lile this. Welp managed hold cases 100 days. good lasted. Wikipedia source. Wikipedia cites sources, quoted wikipedia articles.

It seems like even know wikipedia works... I've expecting to. Unchecked spread always helpful mutations, y'all. half populace all, ""if get it, get it.""

I assume Americans we're gonna go history book reason almost went extinct, days. agree, government needs stay lot things (my vagina, bedroom, chose love, etc.) fabricating science one them. That's every time estimate given, given assumption government citizens behave rationally. come across smug, apologize. intent perhaps re-evaluate future. believe one believe minority people time, luckily, opportunity learn bigger picture. Now, go prepare second wave. hear that's really supposed get attention. right circlejerk part, wrong mask effectiveness. Look cases state plot mask mandates took effect. Worth pointing something like would already posted thousands times showed masks decreased cases. listening President. :( - Chuck Testa You're100% correct. Even worse, leadership actively encouraging partisanship. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è   corona pandemic caused Swedish disaster historical proportions.

Hysteria. think Black Death listening people. Sparse population also means smaller capacity hospitals ICU beds. rural communities acted like invincible, actually vulnerable. least large cities, lot hospitals ICU beds. large cities struggling, can't even imagine hospitals look like smaller cities/towns. Fauci 84.

He give shit administration wants anymore. 

He's unmoveable. tells like is. perfect he's got right now. oneliners like your: fucking christ delay

that low quality information, leads nowhere. Unfounded unsubstantiated stuff made thin air. bread circuses! Classy. And, science seem get along you. Go buy nice house shore. I‚Äôm sure OK. OH! one week ago, saw ISD post ad school wide water park trip anyone could participate pandemic. white population plummeting. Stop logical, cautious, responsible everyone else things. Totally kafkaesque. Quarter life crisis? 3 eighths life crisis? know I'd love actually talk counselor. insurance can't afford it. 

Pity. That's bit like US invading California. Reading OP's response, seems they're american *also* lived Poland, realised sports bias lived Reddit. scientific realm.

It's discussion, demand seriousness person, least provide serious point - agree points call citations? realize sincerely dumb sounds?

Lol. agree point view *plausible*, yeah something like prevalence conspiracy theories likely outcome complicated social dynamics. simple consequence sports emphasis. also call anybody uninformed thinking same. would have, would scientific result back need citations factually accurate points made either 1) sincerely dumb 2) purposefully idiotic bc everything talked beyond common knowledge grew states.

TL;DR seems know already facts, I'm stupid able learn facts, absolves providing proof facts. Also, read comment, worrying facts ""common knowledge"" sort sociological study. So, really facts scientific war, systemic racism, poor education system disinformation campaigns

Don't set false equivalences OP's comment racism denial, civil war revisionism, like. problem those, they're factually wrong too, they're proxies justify racist attitudes, xonophobia, etc. OP's comment clearly none sort.

And disinformation campaigns known phenomenon within certain social circles, assume they're widely known detail people. Like, yeah, Trump disinformation loudspeaker set full volume. trend clearly predates Trump quite bit, watching news nowadays appalled disinformation right far understanding really campaigns done. yes, citation would indeed help OP. Would golden opportunity know feddies going duck Agree Christianity learned child 60 years ago. don‚Äôt agree all. However, senate isn‚Äôt actually invoked negotiations. Right? It‚Äôs president‚Äôs chief staff Mnuchin? 
Seems like senate doesn‚Äôt bill won‚Äôt unless president agrees it?  Haha. probably meant ""rural,"" great image, given students schools. course impossible create ""no-covid zone."" someone NPR saying, like trying create no-pee zone swimming pool. work. believe wikipedia reliable source, wrong. know website works? not, look maybe look embarassing posting such. Find another quote. thought freedom unit length nimitz class carrier clearly understand relevance reply. reason shut things flu, Covid, covid several times lethal flu, likely cause lifelong permanent damage lungs, one immunity. sensible Presidents (yes, even nutso Bush) compared demonic nightmare now, committing election fraud speak. That's we're working now. daughter received 2 flu shots life. almost 3. 

We havent seen family friends since march.  work home left twice two doctors appointments i've worn n95 mask too.  wife works 5 days week rotates n95 mask wearing one week. grocery shopping sams club scan purchase phone without getting line / talking anyone. definitely wear n95 anywhere. 

i actually received new order 30 n95 8511 10 pack last us rest 2020.  i'm also weeks away receiving 2 cambridge mask ordered months ago.

Basic biology logic incident enough bring level 3 ppe prevent airborne spread. might well shadowy cabal's attempt reduce world poulation; would less embarassing tallying much incompetence short-sightedness takes get state world in. Unbelievable. They‚Äôre local school district Facebook groups WAY FUCKING GO ASSHOLES! interpret it........... even young children understand this. Sweden done worse virtually every nation planet.

You know 200 countries, right?  live too. seems obvious summer vacations adds social distancing measures. Many people country side, schools universities closed, less rush hour congestion urban public transport etc. Read answer above.  Yeah uhhh. shit? Texas requiring districts offer online in-person. Texas teacher. Bruh need contact law enforcement. Actually, would included [HEROES know, plan House ready back May. Hahaha ü§úü§õ Literally worst case scenario anyone ACTUALLY getting covid surfaces touched? even happening all? one single confirmed case anywhere world? 

And enough cases make even 1/100th 1% infections? CDC estimates 10 people infected every one reported. South Carolina DHEC estimates 9. puts cases somewhere 1 million 900,000 ... 20% population. wouldnt even know aristocrats What's sad government shit help starving. leave people donate local food banks. literally own. Yeah, I've trying take people greater need get them. Yeah...I asked plenty people industry. starving making rent #1 priority. 

They wish could staying home risking exposure, unfortunately option most. Like said, live fantasy world government taking care people worry basic needs. Actually, know virus deniers cross without looking. Hey, even know walk middle road! Technically, need go back town halls listen people. MRNA gets cell transcribed protein. process little chunks protein get attached MHC immune proteins get displayed cell surface. activates cells fight virus. technical. consider way Janet *feels* ‚ÄúTechnically lot cases church, feel followed protocols,‚Äù Poston said. theory brains infected Covid virus talking.  Shouting people's faces great way find new hosts.

Source: I've seen good zombie movies link cases look like start dropping end June, opinion lined start summer holidays(mid-June). clear I'm saying summer vacation alone responsible drop case numbers, would consider least possible effect. Uppsala couple years ago autumn, talking people got impression like every second person spoke gone away summer, common. funny asked ""What weeks end summer house?"", reply almost always ""We work summer house(renovations &amp; repairs)"". thought sort summed experience Swedes would go away vacation work. guy super troopers? PCRM vegetarian organization.

Not thought virus food bring anyone joy, COVID-19 dies exposed type heat associated cooking. hygienic preparing meat, regardless.

Meatpacking dangerous virus, COVID-19 made even so. humanitarian reasons reduce stop meat intake. presence virus meat probably much threat, particularly handle properly. read somewhere years ago low. Basically said double dose every 2nd day, bigger dose week absorbed better daily. There's sorts research often contradicts hard tell what's legit not.

What‚Äôs like trust country‚Äôs leadership?? It‚Äôs protein based single cell organism that‚Äôs evolved live outside host. Yeah would expect bell curve shutdown still left essential businesses open still people moving around buying groceries things. wasnt complete total stoppage 100% population never left homes, mention long incubation/asymptomatic period increases chances people unknowingly spreading friends family, also fact there's still good chunk people believed hoax downplayed refused wear masks. frustrating, that‚Äôs works, morons. shocking revelation. comment inferring are, relatively speaking, 1915 now? Dude - one wearing fitted masks. Look around. Well NYC something common Sweden, death numbers case counts high early compared places. Also consider Wuhan, despite lack data, second outbreak. 

What follows antibody testing confirmed case count almost certainly underestimating amount immune persons, one way another. China said outbreak Wuhan over, may fact lying, underestimated amount already immune people. comment chain hilarious. dude keeps digging in, deeper deeper. Reminds Dan Cummins bit [compulsive  Thanks mate - wish best too. can't imagine frustrating must watch handled there. 

At time government responded latest outbreak, four cases. thing almost everyone NZ thought going back alert levels 2 3 reasonable necessary response - things communicated clearly understand need why. There's people around edges disagree, fair, vast majority population eager get job done. really lovely hear people talking - there's lot 'yeah, sucks, need keep everyone safe', concern everyone else really encouraging. I'm proud us! got work healthcare setting. Wear mask 10 hours day getting face face patients. come home, drink , eat fall asleep. shop every two weeks. 

Been like since March. bought stock makers mark. Btw that‚Äôs 0.4% Literally taking money running. Georgia schools remain open 3 weeks obtain full funding.

Or lot worse geography I'd previously estimated? Viral hallway photo. Nice multiple meanings title. don‚Äôt think summer vacation country side contributing factor? Jesus Christ. I'm glad chose fall semester university remotely. No, Dems support universal health care. don‚Äôt support single payer. different things. Germany, example, universal healthcare single payer. sure, you‚Äôre paying attention.

Regardless, even really prefer single payer, Dems working expand healthcare coverage least Johnson administration. GOP tried remove social programs federal level. yes, they‚Äôre same... know someone spit conservative agenda nonsense say ‚Äúleft wing‚Äù ‚Äúright wing.‚Äù rarely hear people vote democrat use terms like this, let alone call liberal. 

All name calling comes conservatives make politics sporting event. 35 kids died? "" ..the absolute increase deaths baseline (ie, excess mortality) observed peak 1918 H1N1 influenza pandemic higher comparable observed first 2 months COVID-19 outbreak New York City.

However, baseline mortality rates 2017 2019 less half observed 1914 1917 (owing improvements hygiene modern achievements medicine, public health, safety), relative increase early COVID-19 period substantially greater peak 1918 H1N1 influenza India, right.

Same Spain Italy. It¬¥s puzzling that, lifestyle, Spain struggling back Italy seems everything control. Why? Nobody really knows.

Definitely many lingering questions, transmission CFR ([which think take years properly virus covid long run.

That's feel confident saying like, less than, influenza.

This new serious threat figure effectively fight yet. Meanwhile great number people dying. none, I'm smart enough understand masks work.  

I certainly track record telling nation masks work global pandemic respiratory virus. 

 CDC one! would argue enough precision... :) Funny enough, they'll suddenly tons money deploy riot police people lose minds this. Civil unrest 3, 2, 1.... also banned there. Hopefully we‚Äôll win Senate House, ditch filibuster. people think that‚Äôs much jobs:

I worked server. made $100-200 tips shift, four nights week. paycheck came around $200 week. weeks made $600-800. currently get $143 week unemployment. $600 supplemented income around actually made. 

I can‚Äôt go back work health condition. I‚Äôm good money now, really around January. full run Spanish flu. Covid around months it‚Äôs making rounds USA. taking account ventilators anti viral medication etc. world less advanced back then, heck barely even knew virus is. genome sequencing antibody tests blood transfusions people antibodies sick. Imagine there‚Äôs icu ... Correct I'm wrong adjusting Spanish flu's numbers total world population. 

The adjusted death toll 1918 105 - 350 million. stopped running outdoors (I treadmill, live city) hate seeing runners coming towards sidewalk without masks. 

They max shedding sidewalks, little care they're impacting others. people south even species? Sweden done horrible job metric actually measured, excess deaths? Conservatives seem concerned ‚Äúfeels‚Äù right, ignoring actual data blame one side other. 

Republicans want kick road piece meal relief.

Democrats want burn whole thing ground get everything want. 

Eff all. Republicans could done more, Democrats could accepted less. need bullshit dem demands once. 

The republicans offered plan would given us relief. much some. Democrats threw trash demanded nothing. 

Again, eff all. defend either side blame one party other. fool. They're intentionally dragging make things miserable possible us.

Larremore, Daniel B., et al. ""Test sensitivity secondary frequency turnaround time COVID-19 surveillance."" *medRxiv* (2020). worst case, positive result sample taken exact moment incubation period viral load high enough show PCR test, expected 8 days stop infectious.

Of course average case different. PCR tests still show positive result weeks stopped contagious. Many people test positive longer infectious sample taken.

The CDC says safe around others 10 days onset symptoms, provided fever 24 hours symptoms improving: far immunity, argument whether lasts months years: Let's fucking it. I'm Dems passed stuff keep people homes keep people health insurance pandemic.  That's important. 

And point, that's INCREDIBLY different republicans. simply accurate say way. 


You asked bills, gave links covid-specific bills hundreds upon hundreds bills PASSED overall. 

I know else say preconceived notions consider really solid evidence like that. yet push open schools fall classes smdh feelings really matter here. Fuck Senate hate boner UK, utterly disgusted shameless government doctoring data political reasons (i.e. looking better).

If search ""covid missing deaths"" something like easily find articles data excess deaths main countries involved. 

Belgium - 9,000 excess deaths, equal number official covid deaths

One thing continues surprise me, though, many people keeping abreast latest knowledge coronavirus not. 

She says ""something"" needs done, mentions temperature checks option. already known would ineffective - educate *is* effective advocate herself, colleagues, students? 

That goes even administrators school boards government officials making decisions. absolute duty facts understood current science, yet many, many fail basic obligation. even hard - regularly reading Google news feed keep pretty up-to-date.

The biggest danger going breathing shared air confined spaces, air quality management key. large percentage cases asymptomatic, temperature checks prevent spread, masks will. 

But no, let's limit kids 3 days week (stuffed classrooms dozens others without masks) spend 2 days sanitizing every surface (even though fomite spread considered major driver disease). proud city, 4th largest city North America population (sandwiched LA Chicago) we've around 15-30 new cases per day weeks now. today officially Covid inpatients hospitals. 

Our province, Ontario 43 people currently treated hospital COVID-19, (Ontario Canada's largest province - US state would 5th largest, CA, TX, FL NY) 20 ICU 10 requiring use ventilator. Ontario mostly 100 new cases per day past couple weeks. friends think hate (kinda) since I‚Äôve avoiding outings. feel really guilty need remind shouldn‚Äôt. vaccinated Chicken pox?

Prison (coming soon), woman (already there), man (soon there), camera (always remembers), TV (transport method). yet fellow citizens would rather see country fall admit wrong put mask. *sigh* we're nation full religious nihilists. saying spread food itself, frozen packaging. people risk would warehouse port workers.

You sure showed me. Go l*bs somewhere else.

And yes, dare entitled understanding people different. wish right last month said would spring 2021. May said would fall.

There time monitor see much longer likely last.

The guidance said terms determining might need consider isolating. They're saying recovered past 3 months, need isolate.

This suggests high confidence reinfected within three month window.

It speculate much longer may be.

To extend great confidence, continue observing people longer periods.

The real way determine long immunity lasts measure real time. last.  posted links bills Dems passed help people. 

Yo attacked personally it. *""If watched four parts exploration Bill Gates, one informed people planet true nature actually believe page context quotes makes informed? that's irrational, delusional.  hear countries accepting Americans right now.  We're showered trickle wealth. golden shower economic opportunity. make sound overly complicated. 40 coronavirus cases expected among study participants time. That's much data pore over, honest. One statistics graduate student could hour.

Also, making conclusions efficacy simply means plugging two numbers formula (the numbers infected placebo group real vaccine group). data processing part definitely adding delays here. Exactly. I've argued people wearing mask say ""I've already tested I'm fine."" always say ""you fine moment tested.... could infected way home day."" look like ""damn im stupid thought that.""

Sorry ignorant facts make coherent point delusional realize none said true.

The Dems went pretty far way tell every turn give fuck vote, think win without it, I'm happy oblige voting someone else.

Liberal vote shamers can't even bothered fact check damn sure gonna change Living parents constraining. moved out, got dog, spontaneously went trips, stayed late, people over... without discuss single thing anybody.

There's certainly shame living home (I too), really liked living alone.  get trying stuff, disagree trying ""help"". ineffectual, based around propping flawed system first place. I'm going give anyone medal bare minimum. going judge based awful side is. That's bar keep. never ever pretend enough. 

I'm voting Biden, honest god choice anymore, serious now. mean us compelled accept type bills coming up. getting blocked prescription drug bill, might well get blocked medicare bill. Keep believing either party actually gives flying fuck you, dont oh, dont care we're suffering even little bit. Doordash driver, can‚Äôt tell many huge parties drive huge group people, masks, close proximity. mentality right now: don‚Äôt want sacrifice life moments (a lot graduation parties see). extended family friends immediate family be.

Really insightful forward-thinking, guy follow science Chinese vaccine actually quite poor, barely produces effective results lab. lot hope super effective. 

The Russia vaccine likely stolen moving quickly give fuck ethics purposely infect soldiers see well works. lack manufacturing capacity produce enough population, chances high political move Putin keep masses getting control. could always buy N95s KN95's drop crappy cloth masks. it‚Äôs worth districts I‚Äôve California desperate special ed teachers many remote. There‚Äôs really simple application many CA districts EdJoin. don‚Äôt know hiring looks like right however we‚Äôre deficits. facility work positive patients yet, stated staff tests positive, working positive patients. Two responses this:

1. slavery one sort another fairly common past, chattel slavery (where children slaves also slaves) far rare. societies like Rome, slavery temporary condition and, would argue, significantly less horrific. 

2. don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd hold Ancient Greece Rome great examples ‚Äúhealthy societies.‚Äù lot good things also lot terrible problems, slavery among them. Cleveland area, though county cuyahoga, zip code lot cases (sorry can‚Äôt give info, could dox point lol) That‚Äôs view, too. seems insane tell someone cannot drink water. Particularly they‚Äôre told safe enough go school live dorms frat houses. guy really master understatement fly imperial German flag. Confederate flag.

They subtle. Terrifying say fitted mask, said properly fitting mask. Slightly different, different.

And yes, people wearing masks incorrectly absolutely problem. think everyone wrong somehow makes right? Maybe use isopropyl alcohol instead Lysol? takes 30 seconds disinfect. put spray bottle. Militarized police make sure happen.

Plus 40% Americans still blame democrats somehow, brainwashed morons. huge part reason lasted long people like refused take decisive action earlier. Suburbs foment malignant individualism internet ever did. would thunk it! mean, besides medical experts infectious diseases! see hellbent infecting everyone missed first time. something 10x deadly normally would be......Kinda speaks it? Yeah, least people know online gotten sick, tested, something else.

I've zero contact humans since first week March though, longest stretch I've years cold stomach bug anything. autoimmune condition, even super minor cold knocks ass month, fucking fantastic. end May New York tested ~25% positive antibodies, yes likely 10-15% infected find this? I‚Äôm lookin info send girl home skirt that's short failure wear mask. Probably wasn‚Äôt widespread overestimation outright lies regarding true number deaths 1918 though... 

Hospitals weren‚Äôt getting 30k every death certificate lists COVID, example Georgia! dumb?  rate, America may idiot free spring. I‚Äôm going go ahead disagree vaccine front. It‚Äôs possible go faster (the US EU) gone without violating rights research participants. Cannot done. Russians get first seriously shady shit like intentionally exposing vaccine recipients virus. wore simple cloth mask top would better?

Yes. Absolutely. trying frame straw-man argument completely ignores protective side mask, primary purpose!

Are sure read correctly? Obviously protects wearer. discussion about.

Right masks used protect wearer around them.

In fact, ***MORE*** important protect others protect wearer. Protecting wearer protects one person, protecting everyone else wearer... well, protects everyone else. makes good argument saying important protecting others 

Why concerned everyone else around you? used joke everything funny long happens someone else. Well wrong asshole thing say. know what? Admitting wrong asshole hard do... Lol smh same, 70% isopropyl alcohol spray bottle don‚Äôt want fridge smelling like Lysol lol. research personal experience seems great practice. amount things people touch put back store nasty. last thing you‚Äôd want track germs right back home. yeah find anything doesn‚Äôt need immediately put away I‚Äôll leave grocery bags front door least 24 hours, disinfect putting away. Oh don‚Äôt forget disinfect/wash reusable grocery bags too! includes rent that's pretty sweet deal dinosaurs go extinct? Meteor. 

How Americans go extinct? Americans. it. Wise words die by. personally cannot stomach politicians anymore. Therefore, vote anyone. vote someone endorsing them. vote lesser two evils. That, think would best way show Americans sick shit. Politicians care citizens yet people still defend fight amongst one another people could give two shits them. Fuck all. think one voted all, would create brilliant display lack faith many government. may fix anything message would nearly impossible ignore. think hundreds thousands people dying big deal nothing anyone says going change mind. said, even people ""recover"" many longterm issues heart lungs. work hospital. covid patients airborne (N95) contact (gown, mask, gloves) protections. yeah, we're particularly concerned eyes, hands, faces. Yeah, one? 10m people 2nd largest state country nearly 20m 3rd largest. I‚Äôd surprised weren‚Äôt infected. never never will. History full examples showing this... Well said.

u/erogilus, need pay attention comment others tried politely counsel understanding realities pandemic. 

I agree hype many corners, also lot hard evidence building likely people long lasting potentially debilitating symptoms people needed initial hospital treatment.

And can't double saying ""well, even right, law protect them"". sounds like want win argument unwilling consider facts points view, childish, dangerous, ignorant. It‚Äôs sad point. Several comments I‚Äôve seen regarding praising saying ‚Äúreal‚Äù doctor sounds like Fauci needs gotten rid right away.. long doctor says want hear, they‚Äôre ‚Äúreal‚Äù doctor. Idk yall highschool teachers late 40s early 60s 90% still work there. fully support schools closed middleschool highschool swap online classes group lessons. Theres better things zoom anyway enable household privacy actual education gives attention seeking options questions, comments, audio text! Assuming literally got infected thats really big deal. flu higher death rate among kids. Wow, TIL. Goes show ~~hoe~~ people believe told. took decades actually look realize that's actual definition insanity. ever told definition insanity?  nickname Donald Trump Damn low life Mitch McConnell got tar feathering running Washington multiple windows, put box fan two them

Most classrooms windows all, ones can't open, open outside, open little crack. teaching partner got little hammer devices rooms break windows case evacuate windows open doors open hallway. there's grift had! Funny thing is, people start rioting Senate White House suddenly plenty money send riot police country beat us keep us line. Bingo Wait lmao legit asking, Lieutenant Lysol? point testing, don‚Äôt response... next month going worst life. Republicans want dead  Really? thought California still Walmart shoppers absolute worst. Giant yelling crowds keep mask place even wear one. social distancing rude hell. 10x figure testing done **April**. 

It‚Äôs likely consistent across fifty states. Also say follows cdc guidelines, surely cdc guidelines better that? It‚Äôs become clear Sweden different circumstances countries. Except worse. NESARA. going hurt either way. Either Trump regains control currency, banking cartels maintain power money. Either way, we're going go full stop reset. 

The global currency reset coming, matter side wins. Either go back gold standard, move digital SDR baskets. 

I agree everything video, explain NESARA well.

 

Pain coming, pain discriminate race, religion political affiliation. affects us all. coincidence Sec ACC acting great idea go ahead college football think bit is, conservative folks like 50-120ish earnings bracket - actually see ""rich"", least temporarily interrupted millionaires

When truth is, conservative powers see tool manipulate meet goals. dont give fuck make 20k year, person them.  Dunno, place got yours. covid apologist agree comment. can't see R0 mortality COVID matches Spanish flu...but I'm ready proved wrong someone shows true numbers. I'm sure study associated article actually telling me. mention chronically ill disabled kids exist! could kill vulnerable friends well. border bordering ocean still border. Instead wiping down, spray food safe disinfectant sides allow sit required time putting away. Alcohol good choice (leave dry). use 5% citric acid solution left 15 minutes. Lmao really wipe shoes everytime walk somewhere?  Thanks Democrats, hope everyone remembers walked. Yes mountains. .-.xD Perfectly valid rant. Also one person lost FINGERS covid. would make unemployable. That's freaky. Sorry stupid question, impossible get vaccine soon? thought way without possibly making situation much worse?  I‚Äôd also like see chart haven‚Äôt found one yet showing percentage people showing symptoms time happens. Ect show symptoms 1-14 days whens common day? Day 11? wrong said? mean there‚Äôs still lot indie movies docks waiting released, ones I‚Äôll seeing theaters I‚Äôm able to. Guaranteed less people there, imo it‚Äôs way important support movies rn, especially since odds won‚Äôt mace awhile (except extreme low budget ones suppose). China want expand influence kill Brazilians, turning country chaos puppet them, want blame country innocent first lock down, May numbers looking fairly good, things considered. went Phase 1 straight Phase 3 we've paying ever since. Well yeah it‚Äôs money fuck Yes, although would say 20% positivity result significant community spread still happening, indicating testing dropped far. 

The situation right testing reserved sick anyways. Although sick might likely get tested proportion currently. Yes, mind blowinf. Also, Fuck sending everyone another stimulus check, work people need 400-600/week additional unemployment benefit - someone able keep working gets buy new TV.  It‚Äôs unfortunate many us would lose jobs we‚Äôre already struggling maintain. Especially anyone at-will state. I‚Äôm sure precautions you‚Äôre talking particular, many (most?) schools, colleges, sports PA determined start person. school system particular quarantining unless someone contact 15 minutes less 6 feet. 

So kid gets COVID? whole class doesn‚Äôt need quarantine, teacher either. addition, heard many people area symptoms never get tested, continue work go lives family member household COVID. 

So, I‚Äôm saying we‚Äôre going die, may fare better states, wouldn‚Äôt surprised see cases rise quite bit fall. No, outbreak UK NZ, single community case 102 days. border security absolute genome testing shown strain virus matches nothing caught border. also testing every single border worker far one come back positive. 

Our experts assessed could expect someone slip border positive every 600 days. perfect, pretty close. suspect case come border failure. Senate exist, gives power land instead people.  moved first apartment, 2 months breakup woman proposed (she said no), difficult decision make life. working home full time friends human interaction, TV video games real change mental health tell. know crisis many people real (I'm discounting all), honestly think might android. cousin kill 2 days ago lost job 3 months ago, find new one, never qualified unemployment.

Imo wanted economy businesses back shut properly kill majority spread we'd reopening fully now...but many businesses stuck semi open

What kills saw happened Italy acted like magically happen spread US. stupid

We needed trickle leadership ok masks socially distant get back track got opposite- deny, downplay, etc Brazil, another country similarly positioned president, severe problems well clearly leadership messaging aspect

I think south korea good benchmark. countries reported first cases day. 5x densely populated 1/6th population hundred thousand deaths

Tl;DR: blame trump every covid death problem? No. lack leadership opposite messaging negatively affect country? Absolutely Protesters arent spreading virus.  Nascar races 25k fans without mask gathered together isnt spreadung virus.  bbqs people share bathroom without mask. already proven virus 19 times harder spread outside.  Social distancing outside great idea summer proved gather careful dont let guest house without mask all. According Benjamin Roin assistant professor technological innovation, entrepreneurship, strategic management M.I.T: 

 *""One dramatic public-policy failures affecting biomedical research lack incentives industry develop new therapeutic uses (‚Äúindications‚Äù) off-patent drugs‚Äîgenerally known ‚Äúthe problem new uses.‚Äù* 

\- see paper Pay success contracts Social Impact Bonds [have fill ""funding gap"".

I sure commercial development memantine managed get funding, certainly would possible new use patent unless way enforce monopoly price. Perhaps drug longer available uses reformulated it. Certainly, statement ""*It easy get VC money \[repurposing generic drugs\]*"" seems go established scholarship lack private incentives repurpose generic drugs would interested hearing concrete examples believe something contrary. Unfortunately one, us strict lockdowns ridiculous continue people went beach Florida got sick. I'd love beat virus, I've accepted totally fine point. possible. current president anything successor tries come January backlash worth effort. going go away, unless states start giving shit time states stop worrying accept reopen. Weve got lot look forward next months staying closed would ruin that.  transport cities make city‚Äôs problem. Covid neurological damage tons people, dude. Given dwindling polling numbers Democrats among younger voters, Latinos, blacks key demographics

Since fucking when? That's pretty dumb stance.

‚ö°Ô∏è‚ö°Ô∏è‚ö°Ô∏è‚ö°Ô∏è‚ö°Ô∏è‚ö°Ô∏èPlease share want help educate others facts risks associated face covering tactics implemented cities, towns villages. I‚Äôm claiming know everything matter hard thinking here.‚ö°Ô∏è‚ö°Ô∏è‚ö°Ô∏è‚ö°Ô∏è‚ö°Ô∏è‚ö°Ô∏è‚ö°Ô∏è‚ö°Ô∏è‚ö°Ô∏è‚ö°Ô∏è‚ö°Ô∏è‚ö°Ô∏è‚ö°Ô∏è

Feel free fact check claims I‚Äôm making here. I‚Äôd love know I‚Äôm misled otherwise duped.

1)P100
-requires training donning fit test prove effectiveness clean shaven face. 
-filters 99.9% particles larger 0.3 micron. COVID-19 virus 0.125 micron. attached saliva droplet virus filtered mask makes viable option workers close proximity one another durations longer 7 minutes
-Cartridges disposed immediately masks cleaned alchohol. Hand washing required handling cartridges face touching.
-outputs unfiltered air exhale. means COVID-19 spreading virus every exhale.
-cartridges contaminated first inhale particles viruses. means inhale viral dose Covid-19 attached saliva droplets virus become embedded surface P100 cartridge. soon touch place mask surface viral load transferred hands surface. mask touching imperative use.

2)N95
-requires training donning fit test prove effectiveness clean shaven face
-filters 95% particles larger 0.3 micron. COVID-19 virus 0.125 micron. attached saliva droplet virus filtered mask makes viable option workers close proximity one another durations longer 7 minutes. Masks disposed immediately use. Hand washing required handling masks face touching.
-outputs unfiltered air exhale. means COVID-19 spreading virus every exhale.
-N95 masks contaminated first inhale particles viruses. means inhale viral dose Covid-19 attached saliva droplets virus become embedded surface N95 mask. soon touch place mask surface viral load transferred hands surface. mask touching imperative use.

3)Surgical masks
-a level 3 ASTM F2100 filter 98% particles larger 0.1 micron (not readily available public quite expensive. three pack 10$ 7-11 surgical mask)
-surgical masks typically fully contaminated 20 minutes use sterile environment. means designed worn public outdoors become useless so
-not recommended public use contamination factor common touched surfaces contacted face touching use
-surgical masks single use hand washing required removal face mask touching use
-a surgical mask loose-fitting disposable mask protects wearer's nose mouth contact droplets, splashes sprays may contain germs. means protect airborne particles. example size comparisons COVID-19 0.125 micron
-surgical masks may also filter large particles air
-surgical masks may protect others reducing exposure saliva respiratory secretions mask wearer

4) cloth masks, bandannas improvised masks like rags shirts
-up debate starting point bandana could filter 10% particles larger 0.3 micron. Another example blue shop towel 5 layer said tested 85% size particle. means helping prevent spread COVID-19 one time decide talk, cough sneeze. 
-intent trap droplets wearer talks, coughs sneezes. means large airborne particles may potentially stopped.
-the mask immediately contaminated soon donned via breath
-once cloth mask donned touched, adjusted removed replaced. means must washed dried reuse. Hand washing required removal face touching
-improper use cloth masks make sick prolonged use without washing drying. means moisture breath create mold mildew environment make sick
-cloth masks offer little protection wearer bystander viral load present

5) face shields goggles 
-offers 100% protection mucus membranes face direct targeted viral load. means someone cough sneeze face droplets would enter eyes primarily. mouth nose would still exposed.
-offers protection inhaled aerosols saliva droplets.

In summary:

None tactics replacement physical distancing. masks create false sense security wearer bystander, turn promotes close contact situations. Close contact situations occur someone closer 6ft objects primary vicinity(like table desk working at).

For example, person COVID-19 know it, could easily spread 50 people single days work shopping wearing P100 N95 mask. exhale filtered. 

A surgical mask offers ample protection ways quickly contaminated suitable general public use design. person COVID-19 could easily spread 50 day contacting virus morning wearing day disposal face common surface touching.

Cloth masks improvised face coverings offer protection close contact situations whatsoever. cloth mask become contaminated immediately prevent large droplets expelled. person COVID-19 wearing cloth mask easily spread 50 day physical distancing hand washing measure adhered to. risks public, wearer, opinion, worth benefit case. medical officials warning people risks involved letting politicians decide health people.

Face shields goggles work well first responders prison guards tense situations likely require extra protection used. 

PHYSICAL DISTANCE GOOD HAND HYGIENE WORKS! PLEASE HEED ELSE!

Thank you, sincerely, time reading message. it‚Äôs like nuclear bomb went off

I assume US? Yea, there's even point trying. widespread. try contact trace, name places went like 5 outbreaks there's way know came from. impossible, even serve purpose could sure. Proms still thing? smart. Dorms really stupid year. silly question, far normal, indoor, maskless, larger gatherings/parties safe okay again? year? decade? never again? news coming immunity lasting three measily months, suddenly lost lot hope had. isn‚Äôt gonna vaccine sillies  So, stupid. (To clear set times better not, problem communal bathrooms, shared HVAC, shared common areas, cafeterias. forget 1918 sedition act kept reporting Spanish flue trickle . Especially cold temperatures. Refrigerator temps allow virus survive couple weeks least; freezer temperatures probably several years. anybody know Purdue tracker like this? really cool feature have. 25%? freaking insane, wtf wonder make people aggressive irrational also? Psychedelics help. issued weekly doses. want us man? Unemployment ass, can‚Äôt afford lock things again. It‚Äôs time people protect pray vaccine soon possible. Lol could do?

Could mutate something good, - like pissing Cristal symptom! Panic porn... figured make headline sound bad, reality isn‚Äôt bad. It‚Äôs fact good news. Honestly probably data issue.

You would think would simple two servers communicate many little things go wrong. Plus buracacy get way point people make creative ways work around upper management. seriously want become hermit live mountains. I'm bartender back work since early may feel like I've seen worst people. I'm sick disrespected job. I'm sick worrying safety violent people become. I'm sick waiting turn get actually sick city terrible percent positive rate steadily increasing cases. wanna grid.  Many people leave school's money set rules spent, often specific sports teams. That's right, there's people want funding play ball yet care education. Redfield grave-digger buried CDCs reputation 20 ft deep. Trump actually real living Lord Walder Frey? Election fastest. ways sue government failure jobs. always accurate. using all.  OK Argentina, yes, sucks.

Americans (and others) casually tossed around word lockdown meaning can't go gym favorite bar. win, real lockdown.

Why work? Idiots. local school district same, ostensibly ""for children"" honestly appease stubborn infestation right-wing wackos. America never gonna get better. chance missed it, late. Next post see: ""CDC replaced pro-plague multi-millionaire donated millions Trump.""  *Just* time election, means Republicans point fingers badly Democrats fucking country by-and-large we're scrambling fix absolute worst Republican mess history. 

Obama trying patch Iraq Afghanistan invasion NOTHING projection we're experience. far least likely explanation. evidence points PCR tests sensitive community surveillance. Maybe heat burn virus away, /S/ late move NZ? Omg. Would believe hit reply comment instead parent?

Agreed points. challenge statement society... government failing us. endemic divide across class system ossified time pursuit 'liberty' really exacerbated constraints placed system pandemic government hopelessly unprepared for. definitely enraged behalf community. 

I'm sorry offended you. reacting initial comment based experience community live in. I've read comment many times public schools daycare, like Jesus Christ stop simplifying broader issue? Like, fact school program kept open families support person assistance virtual learning, county charging families it... cognitive dissonance. 

Anyway, I'm deleting moving comment parent intended frankly eat shit making mistake made, really apologize misdirection. may still disagree want think chasing comment. rather die hurricane home? Okay. sounds completely logical me. u r going see neurologist, covid culprit. Anyways, best luck health you.  I've said elsewhere I'm sure people going willing deal another spring summer live sports, concerts, etc possible, likely. 

You're immune system handle much. Wearing mask, washing hands, social distancing worse virus? people paying healthcare, that's $6.7bn inefficiency  appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* need teach critical thinking skills. applies school subjects. thought ""Common Core's"" intent was, originally...? entirely possible covid still active NZ 100+ days

They genome test it, one active 100+ days. knew re-introduce. fat gotta be? Like 300? 250? 800 pound life cancelled? Ha. agree last part.

I mean guess get mental toll must people, I'm almost living way want live.

I much outside work. might gone grocery shopping every 2 weeks. maybe take kids soccer Taekwondo. issues watching Parks Rec playing Smash Bros day long.

My fear last past holidays (Thanksgiving Xmas) limit exposure then. even wanna know reactions be. Refusing attend holiday get togethers probably breaking point families. Like get written point.

I mean sad something like tearing people apart instead making come together. Democrats represent people generally higher cost living areas $300 going little help people there. flat rate pretty much always favor smaller population areas, like federal government always so.. Fuck rest us guess. How‚Äôs Sweden‚Äôs death per cap compare NY? Yeah, largely point, better put. 

It‚Äôs enough good somewhat content voting election (since Trump awful), I‚Äôm fan Biden, either.

I don‚Äôt trust anyone politics right now. make sense? I‚Äôm sure think more. Fuck congress fuck oligarchy form government. Illinois passed law. assault someone enforcing mask policy work place, felony. Thanks Trump piece shit republicans. hope get covid die painful death. What. The. Fuck. Thank god waste ton time money studying drug work months. Oh wait...... Cue V Vendetta movie. drunk person thinks okay drive. gets behind wheel kills somebody.

The person chronovirus germs thinks okay go public without mask. goes makes someone sick kills somebody.

We really must start arresting people wear mask supposed to. must taken public. Yes may sound extreme f*** much longer go this?

And record time history people thought getting arrested drunk driving extreme.  American laziness, *human* laziness/nature. seeing kind problems everywhere. difference guys much Europe primarily sensible governments reinforcing rules, undermining them. There's reason UK poorly health economic terms - we've done far least protect public larger nations Europe. Trump wannabe Downing Street thinks lie obfuscate way crisis. Americans: Bring on. don‚Äôt give shit anymore. sounds like intrusive thoughts made worse depression. something I've dealt since young may seem harmless time slowly become worse. absolutely normal thoughts, us level. recommend paying attention start become frequent. Allow thoughts, dwell long try suppress much cause react way healthy. think America locked nearly much say. mean completely pointless people traveling places like Florida shitshow back live. need lock shit real, cosplay quarantine thing guys doing.

You implying 2 options here, national unified strategy would able beat like everyone else. get brain. loss smell temporary structural change brain. No, worst case don‚Äôt functioning vaccine all. don‚Äôt see happening. know live there, region cases. bar probably frequented people slightest care virus. previous name stirred also controversy since number 88 linked nazis. bar owners seem like normal people maybe good marketing. like eat restaurant called diarrhea example. Spoiler: never was, we're far behind rest developed world basically metric dick swinging military. We've flawed democracy least two decades now, likely failed democracy. 3/4 Americans don‚Äôt know shit cares Ah, like literally every drug trial ever filed FDA. It‚Äôs fun watching public learn realities drug development process real time, especially sub. getting downvoted insulted telling people trials would take longer anyone expects back April. would know drug trials? It‚Äôs job follow them. That‚Äôs going everyone‚Äôs head doesn‚Äôt biological/biochemical background inclination look cordyceps, like it. look spike we're seeing NY right now! 

I wanted get general idea regards helping schools operate safe manner future issues. Please build idea let know thoughts points. many ideas follow main ones, questions welcome help clarify details. one pushing back school openings classes Spring-Summer. However, immense thought starting idea!

Having greater amount students compared teachers means students likely contaminate halls classes. first method geared towards schools set schedules whole classes students. talk schools schedules individual students later.

Students stay desks plexiglass right, left, front them. know sounds like prison, lets look idea first, imagine children there. Haha. said, face masks still wore behind there. Obviously instances face masks removed class. Teachers ones move classes subjects change, greatly lessen transmission. class rooms need fresh circulating air. calculated using air change rate equation rooms rated capacity. 

Looking schools kids individual schedules require logistics schools part, that‚Äôs paying them, right? kids share class *almost* whole school has, would want gymnasiums. Math 101, followed science, followed rhetoric‚Ä¶ hope get I‚Äôm going this. social distancing floors, bleachers, separate kids. would help attendance also monitoring students throughout course semester, hopefully. teachers monitor students agree course plan semester. favor teachers rotate teaches week ones monitoring. Again, areas NEED fresh circulating air, use air change rate figure correct amount. 

The school sectioned freshmen extra classes north building, sophomore east, continue pattern grade following. class freshman wants take classes area, cannot take semester. brain storming idea definitely needed!

Again, wanted get ball rolling ideas. ‚Ä¶ Interested see people say various areas school day too; lunch time, recess/gym, transportation‚Ä¶

Cheers, People already dying give shit Trump thanks you, comrade! won't. longer look many people eye careless selfishness(anti-maskers), stubborn refusal change course(hydoxychloroquin shouters), false flags(what child trafficking), think people intelligent worthy admiration respect anymore.     

One pandemic support system whining tyranny able freely spread horrible unknown disease. support system smaller Yeah, he‚Äôd rather milquetoast center left candidate Europe, wouldn‚Äôt he? Mainstream Democrats would considered center right Europe. America real ‚Äúleft,‚Äù that‚Äôs sad. reason... except wanting avoid potential exposure deadly virus. I'm unsure UMiami, 4 schools I've keeping eye follow protocol, writing students must (in addition test) isolate 2 weeks coming campus. real way enforce this, comes back students able make small sacrifices. someone refuses make sacrifice becomes infected tested arriving campus, ruin everyone else; however, like said, also think colleges mandating isolation period writing somehow cover tracks something... Really hard see winners academic year. Trump + dumb people do. pen op eds, get TV, write pass legislation. 

What huge propaganda system right-wing has. That's it. That's difference. well, sucks ... kinda both. Medicaid Medicare pay poor/old people medical bills, cover . private insurance cover whole thing either. can't time. hella stupid. US medical care makes zero sense I'm confused thinking it. Awwww, sick comeback!... really addressed *hell* u/JitGoinHam calling thought-provoking whaboutisms. Damn, burn. Please, Hammer, hurt 'em. go. one four kids administrators plague. minimal testing, breeze. big portion negative thoughts keep bringing thoughts. Fortunately, live arrangement people continue socialize, fun, enjoy weekends.

However, people luxuries due turnover. results constant screaming, crying, bouts anger lasts hours. takes toll, step away people act distraction past.  No. article says, hold things outdoors much possible. it‚Äôs possible winter, don‚Äôt.... find way make possible. Obviously won‚Äôt problem one person solves everyone. Everyone needs think themself figure works situation. find way make outdoor instruction, lunch, whatever, work, that‚Äôs awesome. power them. People limited lack imagination. Amazing brains we‚Äôve given! Think digital, man. Find way people‚Äôs homes...figuratively...and get pay it.

People enjoying personal collaborations coming various artists YouTube like. Could get that? last week two noticed toothpaste blood tinted spit. haven‚Äôt issue long while. Maybe get tested antibodies. Nah, it'll fine. promised multiple times flu, vaccine would soon, like miracle would disappear. person said said without merit, I'm sure it. Fan-fucking-tastic fact Fly List 20 years old even weirder me. seems like something would made soon commercial flying became thing. Deny reality lol. LIVE ONE DANGEROUS STATES MEXICO. People US really love imagine mexico warzone, like seriously cant take opinion someone visits resorts come mexico. Take care yourselves! know factors outside control hard times negligent government, cratering economy widespread social unrest. deadly pandemic excuse neglect mental health!  Thats disgusting thing want Sweden face severe reprecautions.

If hurting Sweden, alright problem. hurting everyone else aswell. Europe never able reopen one member fucking maniac running around naked gun, like Sweden atm.

The EU need take action point. Threaten throw Sweden out, economic sanctions, something. Force Sweden lock never open untill everyone else is. exactly moving goalposts? ""goalpost"" supporting political candidate supporting M4A. That's it. support it? vote you. example, I'll voting Cori Bush house district voting 3rd party president. Halliburton? Actually recent New Zealand cases came from, would *good* thing. would mean odds surface transmission outside short time frame astronomically low ""Putin sends regards"" Coronaflu. 3 mos. better nothing, come something else, filing ""Good News."" say people state absolutely saying asinine. Yea Americans asshats know youre absolutely right. Im going go Alyssa Milano news - first heard it. Thanks, Child! No! God No! Please.....Nooooo.... means 25% positive rate university tests, probably couple hundred students running around spreading asymptomatically presymtomatically right now. Let's remember check Notre Dame two weeks so. sure vitriolic apologia two-party system honors principles?

edit: smell astroturf.

edit: downvoting, throw criticism and/or hate get idea think. Otherwise, I'm going assume thinking.

edit: comment /u/JitGoinHam replied 'deleted user', (if remember correctly), basically calling red side evil blue side willfully ineffectual. whataboutism. inane. need better system. JOMALA2020!!!!! dare senators sit getting paid taxpayer money working jobs, insisting would end world allowed people get taxpayer money working job. places congregate, year-rounders tend older demographic, 6 ICU beds available entire basin area so.... it‚Äôs major threat locals. really ‚ÄúDr. doom gloom‚Äù 1908 plague, areas forest nicknamed number suicides committed there. 

It‚Äôs going hellish time nation doesn‚Äôt believe healthcare, let alone mental health. Unfortunately, lot people staying home. everything ‚Äúre-opened‚Äù somehow translates ‚ÄúNo virus concern‚Äù ton people, get spread flu, won‚Äôt wearing masks would help, either. Yeah, would nice sort interstate compact constitutional amendment force state primary elections fall day, along requirements release official results exit polls results tallied. would solve issues last election cycle.  That's terrifying. pretty much buy packaged meat form another, almost way stay safe.  think putting action november stop point. say start revolution  Thoughts prayers\* Ahh yes. You, great arbiter intelligence. computer problem squared 5.  Conservatives denying isn‚Äôt good politically üëÄ I‚Äôm always confused herd immunity. herd immunity mean eradication? like ""y'all"" want die. And, got it, would usually develop flu-like symptoms days.

That's pretty much supposed work, yup. Minor symptoms, hopefully, avoid much serious ones. evidence Black Swans.

Travels Australia, finds Black Swans.

You told us Black Swans.

No, never said Black Swans, said evidence them. changed opinions according new evidence hand. forever necessary.  going first long line pandemics need able act quickly next time around.  got lucky virus containable dealt next time might be.  need prepare for. Polls also reveal 95% Americans say wearing masks, someone lying. Finally! Someone using credible source making point! :-) Gosh, make virus escapes lab? üêü ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è  Oh didn‚Äôt realize one running reddit.. wonder it‚Äôs full fucked jackasses. Don‚Äôt kid reasonable line thinking. republicans expect Biden wins. conservative media slamming every second it. Pretty sure there's currently intense mental health crisis going like said we'll learn year something. realize ""the end 2021"" nice way saying ""early 2022""? I'm USA. conflate hatred Regime anti-Americanism. Also 320 million... basic math smh.


It's amazing people remain upset justified criticism Regime, Regime's utterly gross negligence failure. We're going busy watching politicians ""politically minded"" people spewing shit one another election... thought every single day. kids thought making one showed speech. pick different news headlines, show watch video. always saying...so that's what's important pandemic?!!!! Lmao, fucking hypochondriac Dude, might wanna google ""is TSA part Dept. Homeland Security?"" make assertion. 

TSA may operate autonomously w/in DHS, still part DHS. holy fuck, 24% positive new individuals? high would actual number tests be, 15 thousand new positives??? swear third day row I‚Äôve seen article um, positivity rate hits 25%, replace every single person government local federal, completely replace persons involved running schools outrageous failure. wonder catch it. blood pure Filet-O-Fish grease point. meant future project y'all anyway half million deaths Seems many preferred ignore chance suicides increasing supporting lockdown.

It's understandable people still hosting parties going hang friends.

Probably going help countries like France, Germany, Italy, Spain recording hundreds thousands new cases. slowed response initially affecting urban areas liberal voters minorities tend live. now, unsurprisingly, spread rural areas less equipped deal it. take mask car makes glasses fog unsafe drive. always sanitize hands touching steering wheel taking mask though. group people rhymes zoomers Hopefully don‚Äôt end like Revachol disco elysium. family everyone continues ignore fact based data driven opinion. 

Ah, life vegan, anarchist, anything else makes actual sense.  Shit looking disproportionate treatment, say positive cases Auckland forced quarantine facility still permitting couple Tokoroa isolate home? Wait beds comparatively? I'd think we'd they'd super expensive?  cnbc - top contender fakes news organisation planet earth thunderous applause cdc got us mess? Like everybody said back March/April? even Disney Parks Resorts worldwide, WORLDWIDE, shut down? I've always though acceptance problem. wear mask, means virus real! people much bear. lots people used living 'safe spaces' ignore like around world.

The underlying problem lack humanitarian education modern society. Nobody knows philosophy days. People proud never read poetry instead focus ""really matters"", like sales pitch. result, people cannot tell lies truth cannot cope simple facts life. Pathetic. Okay, say disrespect woman family nurse myself, heart aches them. 

But... sacrifice life, government did. sent like lamb slaughter hospital, government, country value life even get shit together get adequete PPE supplies months pandemic. poor woman want sacrifice life- signed nurse help people expectation would never work like first world country. eyes, deaths healthcare workers contract COVID-19 work akin manslaughter/murder. 50% huge vaccinated develop symptoms, would expect fewer develop severe symptoms due vaccine. undesirables case? example made sure go state university paid went refused take student loans.

Just wondering this? Everyone know went college ‚Äò06-today still had/has student loans, literally *had* take them‚Äîeven financial aid, working (part time near full time), going state schools. mention lot people, ‚Äútaking time make money‚Äù isn‚Äôt option they‚Äôre full-time student lose financial aid/scholarships/grants allowed go college all. lot schools, take much time reapply, another hurdle completing education.

Not mention saving increasingly difficult wages haven‚Äôt kept costs living, many Americans one medical emergency away complete financial ruin. wrt stay-at-home parenting, also account fact one parent end gap job history make finding future employment difficult/lead future hit income when(/if) re-enter workforce start again. 

Basically, it‚Äôs easy say ‚Äújust this,‚Äù US system right (being generous) designed keep people edge. pandemic depressing, yes. Wearing mask? Fuck no. Makes part solution players threaten unionize. nothing left Yeah athletes never good community. see hear many kids neighborhood playing together like nothing ever happened
 
It's parents believe nothing happened, parents seen data accepted relatively low risk children contracting severely negative outcome COVID-19. weigh risk deleterious effects terms early child development.
 
And nowhere close.
 
So yes, kids going play develop grow - even isn't. Note political editorial piece left‚Äôish Swedish publication. decides see coronavirus crisis class perspective, totally fine view. conclusions later parts article, argues class inequality power distribution society affected deaths, regions ruled right‚Äôish parties like Stockholm worse situation others. makes political. 

Which shame, think interesting point, basically is: Sweden hit hard coronavirus. Really hard. acknowledge that, try find excuses try pretend it‚Äôs case. 

But fine line finding ‚Äúexcuses‚Äù hit hard trying find root causes it. author interested find root causes class, privatisation care homes, inability blue collar workers work remotely such. calling travel patterns causes (e.g. people Stockholm returning home Alps week 9), reporting differences countries ‚Äúquasi debates‚Äù. 

Personally, think contributing high Swedish death toll, used analysing numbers. future, over. 

No excuses, open mind comes root causes. testing number keep 30000 keep hearing ""it's spread food"" coworker tired contactors showing arguing putting masks, made sign. Yosemite Sam words ""Mask casket. Covid get you, will!"" Sweden got disastrous result anticipated medical researchers academics. Tegnell wingnuts Can't tell /s... definitely *disappear* summer.... town ride cases shutdown over... already gotten hot then. welcome it. Honestly I'm gonna lose ounce sleep shit ravages country start seeing serious numbers. countries already fucked. Americans arrogant entitled. use slap face back reality. Yes, roughly calculation. factored missing waning antibodies roughly.

I guess US million dead epidemic-related causes vaccine shuts down, herd-immunity subgroup miracle.

They spin hardcore style preserve kind national pride international respect. two three days find mani vector Covid food?/ wonder pissed people NFL college football fall? Viruses don‚Äôt copy themselves. infect cells make copies. takes one virus enter cell cell start churning copies. One virus infected cell produce hundreds thousands viruses.  Careful edge, Plato. come Muslim parents follow believe religion myself. However seeing people around sorts religions backgrounds... makes question religion child. I've labeled atheist years ago, I'm realising late spiritual believe something higher. none cults religions divide us agenda one way another. always though young child religion peace, I'm realizing weapon used pushing agendas peace better human being. replace marijuana alcohol it‚Äôs pretty much thing. exactly it. 

My husband‚Äôs ER RN they‚Äôre intubating shocking number day. beds full. 

No one knows flu arrives. won‚Äôt enough beds. 

Please get flu vaccines year, people. I‚Äôm 45 got first flu vaccine life yesterday Target. Took less 5 minutes. Totally painless. never recover? Now, figure humanitarian use throwing football 100 yards laundry basket. probably get help paying therapy. Call regular doctor stop clinic tell experiencing troubling anxiety gloom. They'll likely able point right direction. risk isolate strip club. However possible. start business? must something community needs would pay for. Usually free. work office, company also usually bring nurses administer flu shot father *try* beat people simply wore masks, think would happen son tried to? probably fine, usually put together machines. possible could infected contaminated line worker, really unlikely usually machines humans finished loading ingredients. appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* Gone Easter That's quite accurate.  need vaccination *work* much population herd immunity viable.

That means large number people given vaccine, 50% effective need give one dose percentage people immunity. do, quite bad. Covid's first outbreak January 2020 China. city almost completely sealed shut down, say 4 weeks uncontrolled spreading, looking 50k cases end pandemic Wuhan, 11-million population city. Assuming 4-week spread started 100 cases, that's 1 infection conversion rate January March, two months three lockdown. particular strand coronavirus. 

So many people knowingly&amp;unknowingly spreading covid winter comes states? lockdown implement? Well probably gonna worse said 1 500 guesstimate sure, lot worse. 

Side note, new cases contact history China days related imported iced/cooled/frozen food packaging. Apparently coronavirus cold tolerant. Sturgis rally . Putin's vaccine best. companies getting record profits, what? Healthcare? Okay, getting facilities busy?

Because people still pay premiums regardless whether treated not.

Many people staying home putting treatments procedures fear contracting Covid hospital, means Insurance companies still get premiums, paying much money procedures put backburner pandemic.

How make facilities busy, possibly even ""full"" given hysteria subreddit, would laying doctors staff? 

There countless stories hospitals laying staff threatening termination staff shares press poorly prepared privately run hospitals are... private companies rely PR make money, doctors share piss poorly handling crisis bad PR could/ would cost future.

Other hospitals closed enough non-medicare/medicaid patients immediate service area, makes profitable run full staff/ capacity. first thing companies cut staff spread workload doctors nurses remain, making already overwhelmed duties tasks even major crisis like pandemic came Something add there. 

It took minute think well thought responses questions. Maybe work math skills. Buffalo, NY area resident someone really enjoys visiting Toronto, makes sad. absolutely right move Canada. blows mind people refuse accept reality. virus last multiple days outside body handful different surfaces including metal, plastic, concrete, etc. would FOOD exception that?

Also going eating fast food ‚Äúsafe‚Äù stating ‚Äúoh didn‚Äôt even touch food. let pick order myself‚Äù, workers still TOUCH food make right? 

I don‚Äôt understand üôÉ Oh Matthew McConaughey, I've seen da TV! I'll listen now! where's Ja?? Nowhere video say model human society lobsters. don‚Äôt understand advice doesn‚Äôt make nonsensical, advice helps people (which clearly does), judge?

Joni Theresa Greenfield (IO)

Steve Steve Bullock (MT)

Kelly (General Primary happened yet, runoff election January) (GA)

David Jon Ossoff (this one admittedly unlikely) (GA)

Additionally, Democrats need hold Doug Jones' seat Alabama, well Gary Peters' seat Michigan.

If want get involved fight senate go to: find state race get involved make difference! WANT us die. perfect place practice sifting bullshit lol. r/covid-19 answer key.  living dream world friend. matrix you. living world see, hear, smell, touch taste. living world run government main stream media filling illusion choice. 

Seriously ask yourself. Really seriously sit ponder question. 

Do honestly think elite going let mass number uneducated desire driven people know anything world govern lives vote pick leaders are? 

We sheep. Take example friend ""federal"" reserve. ""federal"". run ""federal"" reserve voted citizens people United States. one really allowed audit ask ""federal"" reserve questions. yet, ""they"" print money, control interest rates, power whatever choose economy ""they"" see fit. 

Now ask silly question actually choice country. That's whole plan. Ug. Sounds like totally sketchy nursing home. didnt bother contact get deal mass graves ditch.

What mean? 30k vaccine trial, different. Send Sturgis Dems moved bill, say aren‚Äôt responsible either like saying Japan isn‚Äôt responsible stuff WW2. sides blame waiting long congress. Don‚Äôt think majority owned house passing bill May gives democrats clear path okay. sides blame. They‚Äôve gone government shutdowns before. hurts little guys. dense fucking moron

So, supposed this? Canada right pandemic, protest blocked ports, roadways, railways. railways effective protests real pressure government something it. Nothing really happened Corona got way. say nation wide general strike send message silly opinion. think means normalcy full-on normalcy, like pre-coronavirus normal. one we‚Äôre living rn coronavirus normal.   Iowan here, really need defending us. VASTLY overrepresented national politics due first nation caucus ag lobbies. Iowa low population midwestern states reap massive benefits senate works honestly part upholding governmental white supremacy. FDR huge plan M4A plan post-WW2. died first. stalemate likely manufactured keep military industrial complex well fed.  Orphans can‚Äôt drive themselves! I'm wanting agree rich people bunker poor protest starve get brutalized goons. still seems crazy me, came it, think intentional drive impoverished suicide. Can't lower class issues die, look reduced numbers problems now! 

We actually claim victory monsters start thinking write history. slow me, still working. feels like 5 gdamn years since march. Lol ok. ran errand simple observations.

Local pub 2 Mex restaurants = Packed people waiting. masks sight. Can't argue what's going inside.

Protestors = fucking soul. I

I could ride downtown see bars shit 100s patrons wearing masks. Protestors capital point like 30 folks. Tired talking point find another fits narrative. I'm TN way cases still bad especially sticks. Explain homie.

Edit: Drop bucket. Even height saw nothing people thinking minimal protestors first weekend. get ride good bit never ran ""mob"" protestors. Sure enough saw crowded bars stuff let's ignore part Yeah trump said didn‚Äôt want CDC recommendations get way... lol live Memphis, TN assure ""Back Business"" plan leaders downright calling shots. Memphis Shelby County 1,000 tests day recently changed testing criterion one show symptoms COVID-19 exposed documented case numbers falling way one would expect. supposed leaders recognize could ""catch COVID-19"" (I wish means). tripwires statistically going back Phase One catastrophically high across board, came out, adjusted things testing. crazy. Nah probably works exactly wanted to: entrenched wealthy ruling class giving public illusion control state. fact people coats call middle America ""flyover country"". can't expect country unite going insult large percentage country. That's exactly Trump won. riled middle America came droves. Keep we'll stuck Trump another 4 years DC 700,000 people zero senators. Fatigue lasts 4 6 months (depending live) considered chronic fatigue. virus around long enough, people passing threshold diagnosed CFS. Oh, look, another explanation shots health care system.

Thank you; makes sense! welcome away it, understand USA cease exist shortly thereafter federal government becomes dominated entirely interests 1/10th union.

If think thats fine dissolve nation...fine. understand body power provides equal representation member union necessary continued existence union. slowed me. correct. Meaning every State equal opportunity deal nominations. 

If House dealt it, people Wyoming would far power appointments people California. Trump? It‚Äôs fucking sad, way people‚Äôs impatience weaponized. South Florida ""Florida"" like another country. 

And Jewish well. said last week ""not great"" chances eventual vaccine 98% effective, arguing instead vaccine would likely reduce person‚Äôs risk infection 50% 60%.

Eep totally agree. don‚Äôt think larger house would help right now. FYI comment. You‚Äôre right though, senate majority leader wields way much power. pet stores That's pretty much do. seem improving anything I'm rethinking it.

Given dwindling polling numbers Democrats among younger voters, Latinos, blacks key demographics think lot people rethinking well. growing segment Democrats white suburbanites. (Well, old people want die... that's obviously specific 2020 trend.) I'm sure much longer growing white suburbanites sustain losses categories, especially Mr. Orange Existential Crisis (which, fair, is) gone done (cross fingers).  I‚Äôm aware, lot things government society worked weren‚Äôt quite 1789. Senators originally appointed, elected; changed better direct democracy, also clearly step towards tyranny state‚Äôs majority, gives? land votes, original process outlined explicitly restricting voting rights land ownership, people, changes we‚Äôve made since implied? Funny think majority country public health measures. Unfortunately dumb selfish brain dead assholes going keep thing full force rest us. Looking Southern rural US. mean, stuck inside aside 2 super fun quarantine weeks. tone things plan more, still go work, visit family, went vacation.

you change things do, differently wear mask lot, avoid wearing masks. That‚Äôs did. stopped popping computer still phone reason. I‚Äôm trying figure ways get rid it. I‚Äôm mostly anxiety subreddit helping can‚Äôt delete app either. pumping money sports programs improves athletes equipment, stadiums, experience fans. popular election system states 33% electorate. still gives lot power rest population, mention popular system voters states would vote one bloc.

Think way too: 4 states held hostage states fewer 1 million people depending vote lines up. Naw. That's panhandle North Florida general. Senate passed bill when? brought table when? hashed months ago, waiting last possible second introduce bill right recess knowing itll take hash come compromise. Yep. Normalcy still means mass poverty make feel good. does, thank. Especially last bit. take care.

Yeah, ""0"" consistency. obviously wonderful trying keep job students ability focus learn. know, children learn thrive inconsistent environments. /s Seems like doctors current virus. deep culture mistrust America. population trust government trust other. someone already determined would pay private healthcare (because trust government provide good healthcare), see paying everyone else's healthcare addition own. since trust ""everyone else,"" want pitch ""their"" healthcare. 

It's sad, think made culture deeply unhappy one. One hallmarks places quality life people generally trust leaders other. Without that, think we're pretty doomed.

They're playing odds, incredibly rare COVID anything kids.

Edit: I'm glad make choice Northern Hemisphere usually colder Winter Southern Hemisphere, people live cold parts Northern. found unconstitutional many times though. Also, metropolitan areas extend multiple states live one state might work neighboring state. people show work whatever reason, allowed interstate travel, effectively denying paycheck(s).

Not slightest chance happening Corona.

It's economically technologically feasible so. far hasn‚Äôt need go sweden route get herd immunity using authoritarian measures shut instead let people arent risk scared get back work normalcy would alot faster Elective procedures profitable, emergency room visits treating COVID not. performing many elected procedures thus losing money need lay staff. suspect wont win. president ever reelection circumstances.

With repenetration South Asian countries (Hong Kong, New Zealand, etc) via - allegedly - frozen imports... 

It seems tactical. Also Given governments strong response containing virus domestically...

It seems opportune time well. Election year controversial president divided nation. Kroger WalMart, know sure order something, it, give something better, like bigger size, price paid. I'm store brand buyer :), also mean I'll get name brand. Also, I'm lazy.

Sounds like bases covered though! people forget eyes! Teachers school country call tell parents constantly.  Kid fever load Tylenol send school go work. teacher classmates get sick. that's constant illness passed around schools. 

In district offered digital learning option. parents taking pandemic seriously picked it, doubt ones insist sending kid ones think COVID big deal. going keep it. kids going ones running around school saying ""My mama says masks dumb wear one."" hope he‚Äôs right. sooner better. threshold isn‚Äôt magic, invariant number. change based Rt, least short term.

Of course possible test every single sniffle see covid tell even immune vaxxed stay home.

We're gonna robust sick day protections truly prevent spread US even vaccinations. IE sick people need stay home ensure even tiny window cause spread.

I don‚Äôt even know Kemp‚Äôs first name. many get right? protocol litigation purposes. say asked, done. Ridiculous really. memory cells effective plasma transfusion?  longitudinal study reinfection rates 4 coronaviruses transmit human population. Fascinating article shows antibodies reinfection rates individuals long period time. study challenge subjects, observed natural reinfections 35 years.

They basically found subjects became reinfected 6-24 months getting coronavirus cold viruses. Young people often became reinfected within year.

All coronaviruses different species, SARS definitely different, can't sure anything. evidence SARS Classic triggered long term cell response far consensus. 

Tl;dr known human coronaviruses reinfect year, sometimes 6 months. novel know. Dreamland, CA  im happy either. every day anxiety gets worse. It‚Äôs security theater, like workplace precautions be. allows employers say something. point isn‚Äôt catch infected employees infect others. time fever they‚Äôve already infected coworkers. Americans dead.. weak, old, 'pre existing conditions'.... ~ people depressed, people never depressed before, quarantines fault... ~ Deniers crazy Darwinism would naturally occur morons humanity's ability keep fellow man/woman alive altruistic purposes. Severity doesn‚Äôt matter. still infectious, disease slow everyone infected eventually.

Protecting vulnerable populations entire point, makes impossible. nonsense. Shocked face. dense you? look terrorists we‚Äôve killed. Lmao. Government trying get thrown what. Time eat cake dudes! Yup. get temp checks job comes back around 94 least 3 times week. wife family weren‚Äôt murdering terrorists. wife born hospital electricity America busy dropping bombs town.

Well fuk New Zealand still hero. One advantages zero cases something like happens thoroughly investigated. 100 days without CONFIRMED case. Sharecropping existed 50-60s. bad Black Latino America then. yet determined we'll survive social media can‚Äôt solely blame republicans Iraq war. Democrats voted it. Talking Florida fool. Still around 18% Hey Guv'nor. I'll save lot time money. 

The positive rate surge due lack leadership state, along willful politicization public health issues causing widespread resistance reason data. 

That'll $50. HMU venmo. zealot claims unable see zealotry.

Shocked face./ Damn that's city, seems like they've got covered. Curious got though. Tricia Takahara scene Live Report... Came say same, science-y like ELIM5 talking New Zealand. Robert Koch Insitute German state institute equivalent US CDC.

It named famous German physician researcher Robert Koch. wasn‚Äôt OP talking about. Well, I'm thrilled... 1. economy never factor Sweden‚Äôs corona response. lash GDP numbers? malicious. 

2. Swedish economy heavily dependent exports. Much Norway Finland. Denmark quite dependant exports, industries agriculture pharmaceuticals, affected coronavirus crisis. Sweden‚Äôs exports heavy industrial goods, hit hard crisis. 

3. don‚Äôt seem understand lockdowns Nordics. Nordic countries similar levels throughout. Sweden‚Äôs measures recommendations whilst other‚Äôs legislative. countries locked bit beginning, results behaviour similar. that‚Äôs thing matters. Don‚Äôt malicious prick. Mainly Russia unabashedly full shit topics, without regard downstream effects like ""people dying"" whatever. bullshit leaks everything. point statement ""all evidence"" incorrect Nahh, liberal atheist here. Anything else? guess five percent Boston? island nation military lockdowns they're going back jail 4 cases. lol. pillow fort people want america run like?  Imagine poison gas detector mine, however worked 10% time. Would feel comfortable going mine knowing giving alarm? 

no, i'd damn sure rather detector nothing, seriously question?

how different masks, masks reduce dont eliminate chance catching covid, we're support people wearing masks right? here's another layer reducing chances spreading it. Islam problem. easy use quotes Quran, Hadith, Sunnah justify shit ISIS AQ done, leaves door open extremists pop first place. Sure, it‚Äôs problematic religion is, U.S. done stupid unjustified shit Middle East before, Islamic extremist ideology need bear brunt blame what‚Äôs going there.  wear masks Europe? guess filling pool chlorine... We're country highest rate people believe conspiracies. 

And good reason. Look conspiracy theories ended We've also got worst literacy rates developed nations. 

Thanks government run Trump likely get reelected, whether corruption, appeal religion, disinformation above.

Have *seen* opponent? US opinion



I'm bit concerned validity vaccine's safety pushed current administration. safe us take time, future effects. wait least month scheduling vaccination, trust scientific proof. Assuming I'd able afford it, is. even study shows reduced severity, would follow even flares back less severe. do? Same! tend take mine know I'm going home. hard to, definitely better nothing. hard stay consistently right thing. government told us beginning community transmission inevitable, expecting point think issue caring, average GP trained deal mental illness issues outside light anxiety. So...in sense, unsurprising treatment subpar (if speaking personal experience). Please, please seek specialist crisis. see say, error reporting tests past week. Dumped backlog tests Thursday. That's guess 100k+ tests dropped Thursday. ""Woman"" Leadership. it, we'd like EU right now. Opening up, perfectly fine. 

BUt don't.  narrative US point. everywhere. called flu Italy getting hammered. wonder past refund point money collected year. This.

There artificial middle class created due GI Bill, US LITERALLY modern nation untouched infrastructure war. could trade wanted 20 years, 0 competition.

Now imagine made college free everyone? could artificially expand middle class again. aka morons Need take rectal temps instead surface temps... Good point. Thsnks commenting. Agreed. shame election year democrats would rather argue trump work together. scares already feel I‚Äôm thinning (even though one else agrees still) would throw lost hair like this.
Alyssa Milano said falling basically clumps.
She video using clean brush brush hair brush full hair.
I‚Äôd rocking corner. could legit question. asymptomatic less symptomatic could indicate preexisting cross immunity, presumably coronaviruses.

Not saying case. best case senario. ""They even affect children!"" talking herd immunity. reinfections possible, it‚Äôs completely impossible dumber idea already is. Either business usual, people receive even lower quality education. Seems like win-win certain groups Love didn‚Äôt read article know gonna thing. Love countryyyyyyyyyy usually sanitize hell hands taking mask off. know even employed people barely holding together. Everyday US seems objectively shittier.

Call kooky, think that‚Äôs relevant info community. I'm front line health care worker, I'll likely choice matter. I'll definitely waiting kids get tho. well good declare vaccine safe children, I'm def gonna wait months see happens healthy kids first

What referring hurdles America: motivation, cost, boosters etc. People gonna run get even available get working table isn‚Äôt ideal. way could make enough money support family. like make sure get paid... elected meaning serve us. last eat... many 9/11s worth deaths covid? called Mexico ""shithole""? Ehh...this seems like stretch. mortality rate COVID 4-5% (which still bad) Spanish Flu like 20% IIRC. Zoom Halloween üéÉ  Agreed. 20 million reported cases. Say hospitalization rate 10%. would 2 million.  going since March, earlier areas.  would thousands reinfections, I'm hearing hundreds, let alone thousands.

Yep. Thank you. I‚Äôm thankful parents stepped help it‚Äôs humbling 40s literally income fault own. Dude way understatement that's amazing. Anyone else would livid officials listening bizarre political point scoring. top millions every day people basic safety stuff either pride, misinformation, loyalty bizarre politics elected officials. conferences tryin push delusional fools.
I'm one conferences love team one mine plays need football fall...it safe players involved outside venue. Except proves low risk transmission is. New Zealand imports ton food, risk anything higher miniscule, able maintain 101 day streak. countries intent elimination strategy, tail risk considered anyone else, there's risks orders magnitude higher. every story virus outbreaks written cranky baby boomers? passed bill 600b people 2T pet project pork spending unrelated current crisis. dead arrival. country without soul, every man themselves. screw guy look like talk like me. getting harder harder distinguish disillusioned Americans paid Russian disinformation. guess that's they're paying for... Welder Boilermakers. You? Btw senators multi millionaires 6 figure salary gravy. also happen best healthcare plan life. Democracy suckers. Pull together millions work unemployment worth damn, yes ok.

The test said looking two types antibodies tested positive antibodies expected long lasting. believe virus March took test early August quick strong positive antibodies - test said wait 10 minutes checking result mine solid 90 seconds in.

I know immunity lasts forever, I'm 4-5 months road ill still apparently going strong. gee, could possibly go wrong. really. got rid almost everything good, including potatoes. Vote every GOP member... Democracy depends it. Disease discount! Thanks AMC! actual concern though. children go parents able them? parent 8 year old do? leave kid home? pay suspended.  Ooooh. Texas? Unions (LO) still behind it. It‚Äôs normally fairly decent publication, political agenda, don‚Äôt hide way. 

Message is: let‚Äôs talk class issues root cause terrible Swedish numbers. US overweight obese. argument rather moot given urgency circumstances. Im overweight concerned would happen got this. Lingering flu symptoms flu early twenties bad want have. flu novel SARS virus. Thank work patients. tell ones die yet left damage this. them? lazy unhealthy too? rural communities acted like invincible, actually vulnerable.

Right. still need masks! MarketWatch shove fear mongering asses. TL;DR get flu shot Lots midwest sure Also saying things like maybe normal life 16 months makes even healthy person dark thoughts.  Exactly. People congregate we're social.

There advantages indoor bar indoor bar.  I'd call ironic, reality overcompensatory term since start. don‚Äôt believe we‚Äôre valuing education life especially since American education system joke. everything else money, Republicans don‚Äôt care education actually they‚Äôd prefer dumb. reinfected, exposed. antibodies they're supposed stop reinfection. Anyone trying save democracy late game denial. 1981 democracy left building replaced pseudo democracy? I'm sure big brain word know ain't democracy. People praising reopening schools case numbers way down. testing fell cliff last month people ignoring high rates hospitalization, icu vent usage. long life ‚Äúlooks‚Äù normal don‚Äôt care. do. wife tailor, dozens masks different fun patterns you‚Äôd like one. I‚Äôm sure got idea didn‚Äôt.... False negative tests? want take everyone else go. :( look like high school girls gonna stay age... Depends long takes able get again.

Say 5 years.....  better hope things sorted better then, lot people little extra lung scarring maybe real treat...  5 years that?

If 2 years, thats whole hell lot worse. mean likely outcome instead drug smugglers unlikely transmission frozen food. No, possible/s It‚Äôs individualism. It‚Äôs selfishness. We‚Äôre selfish. disability, got fired January, qualify. System seems work. want job, work. Can‚Äôt keep saying it‚Äôs hoax, it‚Äôs getting smaller, don‚Äôt need anything. peoples lives stake. No, mean Notre Dame according numbers... Try private tutor family money. Private school tuition three kids must add acceptable wage. Helps connections. according plan. wrong reasons. First, 50% effective vaccines different 80% effective masks. 80% mask number worn correctly consistently. Masks can't worn consistently perfectly times achieve 80% effective (it way lower population), vaccines immediately reduce spread 50%, gigantic impact this. way easier give someone shot every 3 months make wear right PPE every single day.

Second, Fauci saying 50% effective, citing FDA standard least 50% effective bottom range effectiveness. Measles vaccine 93% effective. flu vaccine 50% effective. somewhere two ranges, downplaying expectations. really know 50% 93% land, lot evidence right compare COVID vaccine (it existed before). True. personally, September seemed little soon anyway. don‚Äôt mind waiting extra two months concrete, accurate results. Fixed! cases peak past decline flatlining matter, Gam Gam got live another 3 months locked away safely nursing home passed heart failure! Hooray! [This took 12 seconds still couldn‚Äôt get right. Smh It‚Äôs best I‚Äôve got. I‚Äôm struggling think positive aspect virus it‚Äôs impact world. causing spread. price gouging Monkey see, monkey do. all, animals. 

The failure top absolutely 'trickled down' encourage gross negligence levels. cultural issues course. limits 'great man theory'. 


But overall, catastrophe showing importance good leadership. totally favor decisions made metropolitan area level saw shutdown places hardly cases others tons cases. made sense.

Then saw mask mandate come governor, left local governments enforce sure enough, fucktards county saw rising cases still voted it. Thankfully city mayor stepped in. city mandate little suburbs town without mandate. 

I know right solution is, probably nationwide mandates based cases population density. Every college like unless lock students single rooms. Doomocracy proven wrong ""constantly six months"", prithee? Iraq ""War"" started 2003. still get point. Source? I'm genuinely interested *worst* case.

The pandemic we're getting could easily deadly virus.

Think Ebola microdroplet transmission. kills 35-37% victims even first world care.

Or smallpox. 

Or resistant Measles. 

Want nightmare apocalypse? response deadly disease we'd get one. Bingo. enjoy downvotes that‚Äôs reddit does. lot help us, politicians can‚Äôt even agree masks worn all. It‚Äôs inevitable

MODERATOR r donaldtrump

lol, yeah, figures Thank god congressional democrats concede heard that. Got source? Yes, 99.96% chance survival, can‚Äôt find much better odds that. point. Banks skeleton crews little face face time w/people. banking online now. ‚ÄúThis misbegotten episode regarding hydroxychloroquine studied sociologists medicine classic example extra-scientific factors overrode clear-cut medical evidence,‚Äù Yale Professor Epidemiology Harvey A.

When quote Risch, know agenda is. 

More crazy talk:"" placebo used, folic acid, may well placebo all. certain forms, folic acid actually used diminish COVID-19, inhibiting virus.""

It's another overly long pro-HCQ article.

Flagged removal. None ever said lockdowns would prevent resurgence .

It knocs caseload way down..Off course prevent it, eventually go back up. even worst enemy deal losing job, dying family members, etc maybe finally cause ppl vote protest band together slipped dark time somehow. government run lives, working class run world. compromise, things get better. influenza related deaths shape form bacterial pneumonia. However 1918 furthest extreme, cases. Also bacterial species present atypical representative bacterial pneumonia today, example. part normal flora.

Basically, bacterial pneumonia pathology influenza virus. Stay strong, despite challenging things get cute think I'm liberal. Mike Pondsmith right track we're headed dark dystopian future. Sturgis primarily drinking socializing event. Im side pond, guess easy us tell works here.

America awesome! (lived six months) Ive met plenty americans, lived them, learned them, many inspired me.

But,,, =(

You really need start ganging employer, time he/she needs much need her/him.

If fight civil liberties, fight rights workplace, im talking threatening sue lights flicker second might get epelepsy something.

In resturant buisniess. Ask decent pay, dont put customer.

Thats bosses job give money job. example.

Amazon moved country, got lot flak since couldnt keep standards workers treated, juristiction tells breaking law (monopoly). got delayed becouse loose lot money becouse this. makes think probabilities would multiple like that? effects could compound number different ways. facing death going quarterly issue? We're living science fiction novel. Yet school district sending students teachers back. Fuck y‚Äôall charge howler think US 13k deaths per day due covid? That‚Äôs reassuring...if testing 100% county. women aye, aye. Yeah. really crazy thing stone tablets wrote on, ancient Greeks apparently put much emphasis words arranged page. surviving writing tablets puzzling orientation continuation words. internet makes divide much worse interactions overwhelmingly positive people find annoyingly stupid politically interacting person Ah yes, nobility caring lesser people well.

I bet number senators corrupt pretty pissed least. puts emphasis sports extra curriculars learning. People would rather kid good footb

So one, organization, health advocates sue fight government's choice suppress information 100% needed order fight existential threat? sick early March completely bed ridden June 1. ‚ÄùOperation Iraqi Freedom‚Äù

‚ÄùOperation Enduring Freedom‚Äù

I sensing pattern. I‚Äôm America, I‚Äôm curious Toronto keep numbers low. town relatively small comparison, 100,000 residents so, numbers going up.   that's agenda could post 13k per day US alone now. think we'll October?! Someone blog go put ‚ÄòDems suck like Bieber sucks. Republicans suck like Hitler sucked.‚Äô

So go.

Also, excise conservatives political space, better things get. Lol. funny thing SJW cultists getting rid police remove protection SJW cultists have. penalty killing SJW cultists off, good gone.

Its stupid far right saying masks deadly pandemic.

(I'm endorsing this, saying see outcome) Muslims. 

There hate crimes Sihks, Indians, anyone looked different.

It terrifying time Arab-American. Again, two houses legislators. way system works. America supposed pure democracy reasons stated. 

Pure democracies tend fail, hence reason 1-senators per state, electoral college. 

Its good system. two party system ruining it. would worse IMO pure plurality system.

I glad think farm lands Iowa National Parks oil reserves Alaska mean anything. Thankfully system founded giving equal voice. 25% community. county department health‚Äôs plan, school district.

Well, it‚Äôs 2020, would expect nothing less. However know people buried denial simple statement addressing met ""Aha! See? happen, that's say that. See, that's want think."" Interestingly, influenza rates dropped massively areas took proper measures covid pandemic. work hospital fair, space deal seniors either. dead already, people better chances survival filling hallway. 4 pts ventilator. math.

Couldn't exactly cart streets, ja?

Hotels admit them. back nursing homes went. get maybe worried mom depressed? maybe normal thing cart back home rather bitching lockdown. Since prevents whole trip mass graves ditch thing lmao

Wrt potters field, seriously saying normal expected get 19k coffins filling trenches quickly emergency dig somehow normal? 1 200 New Yorker died. mental gymnastics lol.

Lastly sound true Canada. hospitals w space would send home covid + pts. NYS hospitals overrun... speculation silk seems dope. wear gator mask Nah, delay mitigating H1N1 cool though. 9/11 RINO Bush. Interesting 1% stat. would guessed maybe 5-10% heart attacks would survivable without intervention.

The weird thing data charts. zig zag predictably Covid smooth out. Indeed is. really happy read fact. Means anti-vaxers mostly affecting - totally fine me! Every person smart phone computer, frankly use telephone don't.

This. Hell, could write list piece paper send care. remember everyone. vote sob out. also flood contact info! makes feel better also think wiping groceries probably much way preventing Covid keep it, even things like vinegar/water solution, grocery carts fucking disgusting. little conveyer belt things aren‚Äôt clean either it‚Äôs like they‚Äôll keep wiping forever. you‚Äôre putting dirty stuff fridge, touch make food, continue touch utensils. I‚Äôll probably keep habit indefinitely since aren‚Äôt going sanitize carts forever. boyfriend unemployment due covid lay-off. didn‚Äôt get $300 trump said would extended currently enough money pay car payment that‚Äôs it. allowed right leaning hate guys trump too? state something, least produce evidence.

Speculation hope facts, hope understand. democrats add HEROES act? Nah man completely believable. Totally surprising whatsoever. Totally agree said questionable. Everyone taking trash gaitors though, may may fair. n95 pictures , valved strange. together shoddy ""experiment."" decades. 

As in, GOP held House Reps 20 last 26 years? Also, bot reporting antibody tests. don‚Äôt think really surprising. Science takes time lot variables along way. 

Basically always seemed like case promise, deliver me. Spoilers COVID showing going US.

Seems lot countries thinking can't keep losing money covid, they're slowly giving much it.

Cases go point serious actions became warranted five months ago. nothing happening anymore.  refuses leave Defund police. refuse enforce mask mandates. thousands rape kits refuse test. don‚Äôt take victims (male female) domestic violence seriously. 

We don‚Äôt need them. Cops keep public safe. harass bully people. Well government saying things like ""More studies show kids actually stoppers disease don‚Äôt get transmit themselves"" ""The fact virtually immune problem"". type person believed them, would probably think would totally fine. Like June? EMS says March 1 April 25, received 4,000 cardiac arrest calls -- that's two times previous year.

So ~2 months, 2 times # heart attacks previous year (12 months). 24 months worth heart attacks 2 months, increase factor 12.

This include strokes btw. Fun times feeling June 2021 weddings? What's even frustrating counties actually take seriously others don't. Humans probably survive, think world I'd want send kids 

Have seen Threads? spread food it‚Äôs wonder keeps coming back everywhere. 
It almost seems like person might superspreader - like woman China infected everyone apartment building rising elevator ONCE. didn‚Äôt even ever symptoms. 

It‚Äôs strange family members getting co-workers infected people . 
This happened fiend mine Texas. 32 days C-19 husband /child never got sick. also feeling unwell week decided get tested. dipshit

WTF? Yeah, goodbye. done here.  straw man argument faulty argument address ‚Äúdefeat‚Äù initial statement made, even though 

Ok, fine. guess asking question isn‚Äôt straw man argument‚Äù. would still say it‚Äôs question addressing concern, question reasoning error. question nothing initial concern. made argument *why* argument wrong, would be.

I also apologize dumb comment. Hey me! Didn‚Äôt Trump build wall(with American tax dollars) keep mitigation‚Äôs out? else going live fantasy loose cannon badass says whatever wants? works online, let this. Bay area tech douches need someone competent, listen health experts one lie play pandemic.

Too bad nobody values ballot! 9/11 September think gonna pretty bad. I‚Äôve gotten insulted downvoted even Reddit mentioning wearing mask nose bad idea. cashiers supermarket masks around necks, even pharmacist CVS grabs one hold line puts damn thing on.


How many refrigerator trucks loved ones dying alone going take people handle putting piece cloth face properly? come around now, first little bit mom refused wear mask. I'd ask why, answer ""I want wear one"". People want inconvenienced slightest They‚Äôve ‚Äúdebunked‚Äù unless article today came haven‚Äôt seen. Fauci said immunity may finite. direct quote:

‚ÄúWhen look history coronaviruses ‚Äî common coronaviruses cause common cold ‚Äî reports literature durability immunity that's protective ranges three six months almost always less year,"" said last month. ""That's lot durability protection."" see every day. going get point people going start getting tickets police wearing mask. way hurt Lazy Americans wallet.  invest stonks buy matress made tenders bang expensive hookers on? Come Wall Street Bets show turn million 5 million instantly lose everything. *lose Americans dumb come overly negative. got called crazy coworker forecasting death toll 300,000 EOY back June. funny thing statistics. Don‚Äôt forget gallop polls Lol I‚Äôm voting Biden dipshit probably way left you. I‚Äôm burying head sand trash dems are. acknowledge they‚Äôre better republicans also acknowledge also responsible consolidation power wealth hands few... brain, try use sometime think critically. here‚Äôs example large transfer Literally job can't get work done, get take 3 half week vacation.

Screw corrupt assholes. Again-- living US, planning, manageable. US people equipped it. lack basic financial literacy. 

Have ever considered maybe ""the system"" works 2% people, working all?

&amp;#x200B;

I think that's called ""luck."" Hopefully strong men (and women anybody left out) get aren‚Äôt ‚Äústrongmen‚Äù. feel like much world teetering precipice falling dictatorial rule crisis situations really bad people rise up. somehow escape 2020 without form insurrection I‚Äôm going pleasantly surprised. 

Stay safe, stay sane, make sure get enjoy fresh air. [‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt take sky me‚Äù favorite show soundtrack. That‚Äôs nuts. wonder mainstream media catch heart attack connection. voted early Florida morning (obv primary), quick, easy safe. said, live small community 2 weeks early voting, went 20 minutes polls opened. 5 minutes felt taking appropriate safety precautions.

With impending supposed catastrophe election, taking risk voting person. vote early general election. person social distancing pretty hardcore. 

It's important. Yep, unfortunate reality longer goes on, less people going care. state still manageable, basically refuse leave house except necessities family/friends think I'm crazy. last week, dad trying set dinner restaurant, getting really annoyed gave resounding ""no"". Subsistence levels yet breached, it'll hard get large gathering then.

But, pace, we're far off. lot like polio regard, I've felt. two suspected cases debunked, Fauci literally said thinks become immune (like said complete opposite), literally could better news regarding vaccines. spread misinformation. Objectively. US isn‚Äôt solving problem China could? Sounds like defeatist attitude. that's illegal million dollars would immediately become ~750k could become homeowner. Even fantasy getting million dollars kind whack. Even enforce this, what? Students allowed leave campus entire time? Professors move dorms can't go home? can't make bubble around freaking school watch cases surge charts, see take ramp infection events. K-12 schools clamping single cases pop (which great!) see happening higher-ed level, due sheer number students money involved (plus independence students). think take many weeks dozens confirmed cases actually shut university down, meaning already spread larger community (which harder shut unless shelter-in-place order). That's happens Democrats want tie state-bailouts relief check. That's something trying years. poorly run States, entire Postal Service well. That's failing decades... suddenly, tie check it. Why?

The Federal government bailing states would change entire system. would end Federalism country. Democrats want throw Relief bill? failed own? Lol. 

If journalists jobs even try something like that. are. blame Trump told do.  don‚Äôt think understand covid stimulus far yet come(or not). 

Absolutely none based new tax. They‚Äôre printing money thin air; stimulus increasing money supply. 

Just bit reading commenting next time, friend. regular flights San Francisco, LA, Singapore, Sydney Hong Kong. It‚Äôs way easier suspect international travel source contamination frozen food IMO. played beginning, must work together prevent greater spread biochemist, specifically? Right you!

Imagine work hospital, school, prison even grocery store. Anywhere indoors mildly crowded really. scenario 1, test employees daily rapid tests (regardless symptoms). scenario 2, test employees weekly results taking 3 days. scenario 3, test all.

In scenario 1, end catching asymptomatic carriers presymptomatic carriers quickly get chance spread much - huge really help keep transmission rate 1, meaning prevent exponential growth. scenario 2, obviously great still helpful. might catch presymptomatic carriers realize sick, likely catch asymptomatic carriers well. spread harder stop scenario 1, lot better scenario 3, literally clue whether could silent carriers around. even might mild symptoms still come figure cold something.

The point is, please spread disinformation importance testing. pretty huge deal terms stopping thing places become hot spots end overwhelming health systems, causing lot preventable death.

You realize course, that's science works right? Especially new things like disease, lot variables known, many unknown, new data research comes time. scientific agency ***EXPECTED*** change outlook light new information contradicts discredits outdated outlooks directives.

You're literally saying, ""These scientists scientific agency adapted changing information one specific variable new info came out! ever trust them!"" Elements Pre-k nature academy? Google wonderful! Probably lived Singapore, Europe, America roughly equal amount years.

Lol, sure buddy. THIS. come one day. Excessive deaths year already past 200k. use word goal, acceptable loss ""human capital"" Well, test sick people get 25% fast. /s surprised. gone suicidal ideation last month taking care mental health. youngest kid acting lot since whole mess started go preschool beloved babysitter.

I blame single person suicidal thoughts follows them. Personally may better live long enough vote incompetent one hope best, leave refugee Canada country shit together. speciify reputable sources confident true narrative pandemic?

Is discussing? thought said look post history, did; gotten angry shown trusting conspiracy theory websites clear agendas. Perhaps agree agendas (that's fine), pretending everyone else asleep trusting misinformation sites pretty illogical.

**You:** *Like said, sounding little emotional earlier.*

**Also you:** *You attack! WAKE UP!*

Oh man that's grade mental gymnastics. must trolling. I'll give million dollars point said that.

All straw men aside, point 'sides' this. Inept leadership federal, state local levels. need politicize every issue, lack education, prioritizing economy human life, uncompromising stupidity (yes needs said twice) Americans think facemask social distancing infringes rights. 

TL;Dr irony country spending billions military serve interests elites, rather investing education, become downfall. Pure insanity Lol NY 5% joke, probably happened point.. could forecasted stay open students left attend answers Sweden's bullshit....

(TL;DR:. Lies summer Yup covid precautions we've 36 flu deaths year versus 460 last We're Western Australia. 30000 people go game.

This said vitally important NZ govt figures got through. fact one family worked cold processing unit frozen items we're coming overseas scary possibility. Personally, I‚Äôve lost hope. headway make completely undone kids going back school. It‚Äôs literally trying swim upstream point.

Good thing shut business 6 months quarantined. fact locked parents inside permanent quarantine (with end sight) sadly they‚Äôll probably die quarantine. friend nurse, got COVID months ago. hair falling clumps. need vote America want protectionism? really want that? virus going away next summer. understand this. best bet get vaccine end year. Produce share it. can't give vaccine one country creates international conflict. real concern right now.

Because factors, luckiest end 2021 likely longer. really want shut long? death social issues do. 

This long term. Shutting international travel short term would short sighted happened again. welcome 20% population dead half remains ones permant medical problems. Shelby County starts school year remote August 31 notice. chance change numbers return person instruction.

No,that question.  fucking christ delay. acceptabable first world country. 

I repeat question: source Sweden late reporting deaths compared countries? current data shows case fatality rate US 3.2% right now.

And yes, anyone says anything, know incomplete data set far many people infected infected. also large number excessive deaths since pandemic began, need sorted too. However, since CFR tracks ratio confirmed deaths confirmed cases, feel pretty comfortable using benchmark assumption look back future get better idea happened. Watch influencers stop giving corona parties fear ridiculously impossible average public school. Mine even outdoor space this. can't afford paper tissues March, think we're getting tents supplies support 800+ kids outside 110¬∞ weather? providing adequate water would take Herculean effort. project voice 25+ socially distanced students without disturbing class next us? allergies? move kids specials services? There's wifi reception, outlets, shade Chromebooks work properly.

At beginning last year tried take kinders short walking tour campus. made outside classroom door giving up. far half class literally crying water, went back one student refused leave room heat. Anyone thinks ""just class outside"" needs step back realize completely ignorant modern schools like. mean, hello, really think school changed *100 years*??? believes =/= knows sure. anecdotal thought. biggest threat America faces right COVID anti-intellectualism.

It covid spreading misinformation masks.

It covid that's trying sabotage testing. economy never factor Sweden‚Äôs corona response. lash GDP numbers?

I suspect aimed Swedes. Loads Americans argued economy Swedish economy heavily dependent exports. Much Norway Finland. Denmark quite dependant exports, industries agriculture pharmaceuticals, affected coronavirus crisis. Sweden‚Äôs exports heavy industrial goods, hit hard crisis.

False. Finland faired better partly unlike said heavy industry (and forestry) essential Finland. Sweden vehicle industry, like cars.

What means downturn Finland continue fare better due fact heavy industry turnover orders slow, car industry way dynamic grind halt. expecting Finnish heavy industry post worse numbers Q3 since reason expect uptick amount new orders. They‚Äôre tyrants recommendations state government, many cases. Got keep tuition checks rolling in! right take mislabeled product shelves, ones recalled reason ethanol-based. fact, 1-propanol contamination would probably make 2-propanol (isopropyl alcohol)-based hand sanitizer safer drink, dangerous. much safer; still drink it. NEVER TRUMP.  Better one. best 50% what's option?  like kills something keep attacking me? ""Emotional, scared, irrational, illogical?"" play game? ""Denial, scared, blinded, willful ignorance, etc, etc, etc"" Really productive right? Couple hundred guys gonna scramble story explain wives casual million deaths even permanent organ damage. Yes sounds smarter trying adapt life-threatening events. Might well ignore pollution, climate change, environment destruction directly kill everybody. call authoritarian called science. problem goes MUCH deeper president solve. problem mentality country tbh. calling violence

Well, better getting ready it, whether calling not, 100% guaranteed headed way.

I mean, understand easy exactly possible many parents handle kids home such. said, virus hits school, they'll figure something either way. imagine sending kid environment like that, knowing possibility getting sick, (albeit rare) risk health.

I mean, can't imagine guilt parent sent kid school, reason kid gets extremely sick, permanent lung damage, neurological issues whatever it. Said awhile back, think we're going quite mental health crisis (along physical health) said done. I'm saying could genetically engineer insects express relevant antigens. infect lab bred insects bat compatible adenovirus. Etc pp.

In bat case could even vaccine 10% lethality.



So far seem like cats dogs easily transmit virus humans, apart bats reservoirs?



And vaccine needs 100% effective anyway. Herd immunity exists.

And eradicated rabies certain parts world vaccinated bait. rabies carried many different mammals. Every school valedictorian, every school guy throw football 100 yards laundry basket! 


I'd rather state taxes give next Tom Brady full ride boring science fellas entertain let proclaim school numbra 1!!!! wouldnt trust PA part this. Death numbers arent really tracked properly, one day could 0 deaths, next 30 could die, death totals come days, weeks, even months prior certified, added onto case count day certified. used MERS vaccine I'm expert. I'm sure know do. I'm saying I've read. lot written people extremely knowledgeable field. thoughts extract found.

""A recent pre-print¬†with 200 people Covid-19 detected robust memory T-cell responses blood, regardless symptomatic antibody seropositivity. means infected people develop symptoms antibodies may still immune Covid-19 via T-cells memory. ‚ÄúOur results indicate public immunity Covid-19 probably significantly higher antibody tests suggested,‚Äù co-senior study author, Professor Hans-Gustaf Ljunggren,¬†said."" im sure climate change corona. remember, thought remember hearing spread even likly, stage, shedding virus. Thankfully tracking chips lizard billionaires making vaccine thermometers. Measuring temperature inside body much accurate next pandemic. Ya problem, hopefully see messaging change coming days. might primary vector transmission surely exists. get Rock board host? Ah yes. ""doesnt get it"", ""it"" specified yet; course I'm still one needs ""WAKE UP!"".

It really helps CAPITALISE random WORDS throughout SENTENCES. definitely lets know logical person someone driven entirely emotion. Eh, think modern industrialized civilization survive coming crisis, think we've depleted world's fossil fuels get another shot building sustainable advanced system.

Humans probably survive, think world I'd want send kids war Iraq started 18 months 9/11. Democrats meekly oppose Washington. lot people opposed streets. Los Angeles looked like 50,000ish people. there. Nobody covered media, though, didn‚Äôt happen. 

Both parties pull together bomb Afghanistan less month 9/11, though. Barbara Lee Democrat opposed invasion. It‚Äôs funny sad everybody forgets Afghanistan. worked office next guy Afghanistan legit terrified months. told opposed invasion, marches, missed them. 

My neighborhood nice 9/11. community spirit lasted months. feeling usually people referring say ‚Äúcame together,‚Äù though suppose coming together cheer destruction Afghanistan thing, too. 

Let‚Äôs rewrite history.

P.S. namesake username huge philosophical influence neocons started second Iraq war, post strikes bit strange multiple ways survived civil war, think survive masks worry delayed care surge people going doctors things ease little, hope premiums don‚Äôt go up. time, hospitals bankrupted profit system set up. touch problem solve. People 70 Japan special licenses visible stickers warn drivers cannot drive normally. Scary stuff.... 74 would really expect much different. Losing weight expensive, quite contrary. Oh? thing everybody brain thought would happen, happened. Shocking. think human beings access quality healthcare, whether live rural urban areas. think access life-saving medical facilities, equipment, personnel dictated profit.

You think differently? country ever truly united. Ever Belgium divisions. Probally hunderds next week. Perfect Except none said makes sense.

Insurance companies getting record profits, what? Healthcare? Okay, getting facilities busy?

And facilities busy, possibly even ""full"" given hysteria subreddit, would laying doctors staff?

Something add there. point expect Biden would try president help contain virus tied GOP congress screeching executive overreach second takes office.

Alternatively, (second) worst fears come true Biden shit either lol. get flu covid time? certainly sounds plausible...I wonder immune system viruses would react dual infection scenario? still remember Diamond Princess, played news every day. Insurance, especially health sham country. papers saying immunity lasts 8 months? would like see could easily missed it. first two sort demanded drastic actions can't believe it... Athens right, students back town Florida vacations get rocked. Good article, thank sharing. 

I used wash groceries soap recent we've washing hot water. really is...the scary part hospitals treat anyone comes upper respiratory symptoms Covid patient test negative Covid-19.

So flu patients consume lot scarce testing PPE resources.

Plus, yes, absolutely possible get sick two viruses once. Opportunistic infections happen. surprise humanity enlarge stupid.   
Not personal level global one. US facing enemy cannot shot. agree, shut theaters together, next fall. Yes, can't trust numbers anymore. Faci politicizing coronavirus since onset. actually lose job business quarantine. truly stupid enjoy day. Hope get anyone killed especially people already misfortune knowing you. Unfortunately, common knowledge common more.

You'd think hundred years, everyone would know masks reduce spread respiratory infections, are. point - Australia New Zealand successfully controlled covid adopting various methods like mask wearing successful social distancing. America not. factors would make easier flu season apply Let's hope eviction moratoriums kept place. corresponding epidemic homelessness bankruptcies fuck everything. doubled ? current laws government poor performance. Thanks federal state make last longer. took job Florida left Vermont best thing ever did! Lol Probably not, least handicap CDC might even provide coordinated federal guidance. I‚Äôm starting wonder false negative weeks ago. super bad fatigue, aches, fever, minor sinus symptoms. Lasted 3 days. always take vitamin D. Tested negative don‚Äôt know else could been. Doctor gave presumptive positive. Sinusitis doesn‚Äôt cause that. Yep already got human cat cat cat, including big cats. worried number US infections, another mutation worse. Comparing herpes coronaviruses poor comparison begin with, want talk long term effects compare coronaviruses coronaviruses get? MANY people around globe awakening this. CATCH Ah, siderism histrionics. 

Here's really happened beginning: CDC, WHO, medical experts considering effectiveness cloth masks vs N95. commit error ""letting best enemy good"". 

But know Trump, allies refuse do? Take account new information. (and still aren't) enough N95 masks give everyone USA. reevaluated. difference properly designed worn cloth mask N95 mask small enough make use viable? Cloth masks perfect, better nothing. changed stance general public include cloth masks social distancing order get n95 masks make impact: hospitals. 

And Trump done? He's using mask now, he's still politicizing situation. He's refusing listen experts act accordingly. He's putting effort re-election probabilities making right thing. 

So no, despite rewriting events, happened. waiting pandemic chill drinking you. Forcing zoom classes remote learning everyone solve everything.  wealthy willing spend extra private school, private tutors pods... it‚Äôs right so.

At least understand implications losing 1 yr in-person education child. Never paid anything close that. 

Plenty companies offer free employees, urgent care/physicians normally around $10 Well, since Trump pretty much came said witholding money Post Office, becasue mail ballots, think shot foot this. Sure, pretty much everything basic internet. Also read red hatted friend see requested ""discounted"" laptop one would also increase sales computer sales companies. would suggest America made laptops unfortunately, (let's blame Obama keep interested) Obama made factory jobs puff existence like big old mean Liberal Wizard. Trump wanted 'MAGA' would help create jobs creating demand computers could/should built here. yeah, still reading also something friend, emotional? mean, live life facts emotions know becomes easier function like human embarrassment themselves. Keep mind. never gonna happen Fauci falls deeper deeper hypocrisy whenever advocates specific public policy, simultaneously claims *he's* political one, *everyone else* political.

Making statements virus apolitical, translating policy (and comparing 9/11) totally political. needs posted subs title being, ""Arizona Teachers fined $2,000 blocked working School Districts resigning forced Teach person Covid-19 hot spots."" Maybe, maybe government actually take role leadership address problems money, people, Repu.blican party refuses anything. Record profits pandemic....consider that. I'm literally homeless, yeah I'll buy a...guitar lmao confused title, heard Dr. Frank Lockwood McDonough dying Dr. Marshall Americus doctor featured article. However, mentioned. LOL! Yes. Covid numbers fudged. Overall deaths can‚Äôt. least would much harder fudge. talking overall deaths. tigers Bronx zoo got infected... said mix PVS honestly read symptoms (feeling vibrations) never even positive test really throws doubt much leaning it. PVS need rest yeah unfortunately takes months get over. currently case-fatality rate 3.2%.

Using positive tests denominator? smart you! Gold star smiley sticker you. Guess everyone got covid got tested 'asymptomatic' people myth lol. Thanks good laugh. Enough back forth dimwit, heading fun enjoy weekend. Absolutely correct. fair, point packaging good anything, ""soap"" be. one reads all, unless keep next toilet

But moved away soap *just* saponified fat. add antibacterial ingredients lotions. Cool, really looking forward it. SUPER FUCKING EXCITING. appointed director CDC? Acknowledging *that* agency‚Äôs incompetence way excuses president. IMHO, it‚Äôs actually far worse failure *anythjng* man actually said. Yeah, no. 

If unique USA, perhaps could make sense, case. higher death rates poor clinical outcomes near universal across western nations; even free healthcare. 

This nothing racism. expect full immunity two doses  GeNiUs Hard say effective vaccine be. might get months/years it, might get season, depends quickly COVID strains mutate. 

I think get something effective probably going like flu shot, yearly even seasonal thing. Hopefully slower mutation rate SARS compared flu strains it'll effective overall, count 1 vaccination permanent protection. There‚Äôs still going huge portion population thinks vaccine Bill Gates New World Order conspiracy shit. Look difficult wear mask. think they‚Äôre going allow needle arm? every crisis need look bright side life !-) Swimming flying high density fluid! I've seen supermarkets drug chains US flu vaccine free, offer $5 gift card voucher get shot there. Please don't... serious done life please reach someone. Even me. inbox open Interesting Killeen listed city beginning central Texas closest listed community 4 hours away. Maybe article originally nyt picked up? thinking helping either deaths average excess mortality ""unacceptably high""? It‚Äôs state America general. People become nasty.

Spot-on correct. whole world dealing this, made hoax, unlike rest world, US apparently can't even civil one another. People want believe COVID-19 global plot make current US administration look bad, fine, believe whatever floats boat, pure vitriol things like face masks ridiculous. luck virus enters world happen divisive leader imaginable office. ""The higher percent go, slower death rate.""

I'm sure makes sense, regardless - yes, R-naught decrease people infected develop immunity (along health issues), change fact people still wearing masks, social distancing, 40% said get vaccine. think US 300+ million hospital beds? Lol large number false negatives/ positives, paired long waits. Getting tested, symptomatic, means go quarantine, job wont want hear that. need proof, get negative time point?

To risk anecdotal, got tested give health insurance info, lots disclosure. thought tests going free? aren't, people know it. Hell, everyone family avoids doctor fear bankruptcy... opioid crisis affected family,so mistrust too.

Also, risk getting covid testing facility people covid apt go?

I cant speak actual truth matter, definitely agree people's reluctance go plays huge - I'd even go far say, biggest - role lack testing. No, student Canada last week. Moved back parents US dont currently health insurance. God Bless America Canada takes better care despite paying taxes here. Lets forget, reason Sweden chose wrong strategi couple months ago would cause least 100 000 deaths. calculations would cause 8-20000 deaths deemed wishful thinking. guess goalpost wherever want be. 

I saying Sweden right though. saying many people wrong along way, keep moving goal posts kind fraudulent. Also true thought Japan wearing masks whole time that‚Äôs cases few? House people (and states) represented.

Except wildly favor lower population states. number Electoral votes based number Congresspeople, Executive wildly favor low pop states, affects SCOTUS, on. 

We need, desperately, unlock cap number House Reps. Let guess, think never vote Republican yet somehow also expect listen us represent interests? Insisting voters holding political party account owe jobs waste time counterproductive. going do, vote again? party want people vote ultimately party responsibility deliver promises. Yeah know quite people desperate job, job. happened tar? ‚ÄúYou know human go living several minutes without head ‚Äú. ‚ÄîCreed Bratton health care life. Fucking picks. general strike supposed punish politicians whose salaries paid tax dollars? Selfish feel bad laughing.  salary minor point compensation compared able opportunities provided media exposure plugged-in social circles elites oligarchs rule us.

A meta-analysis 13 studies including total 2,282 patients COVID-19 showed lymphocyte count significantly lower severe disease, presence lymphopenia associated almost threefold increased risk severe COVID-19 (odds ratio = 2.99; 95% CI 1.31-6.82).2 Another study China found 83.2% 1,099 patients COVID-19 admitted hospitals lymphopenia.3 severe disease particularly low lymphocyte counts compared patients¬†with non-severe disease. addition, another meta-analysis available preprint reported that, 2,083 severe moderately ill patients COVID-19, lymphopenia significantly associated severe disease.4

**Cezmi Akdis, MD,** medical researcher immunologist University Zurich director Swiss Institute Allergy Asthma Research, agreed. lymphocytes could decreased bone marrow suppressed cytokine storm home lungs patients pneumonia. patient already decreased lymphocyte count, explained, high viral dose could prevent immune system clearing virus efficiently, resulting severe disease. case, levels cells low clear virus result cytokine storm inflammation, eventually leading tissue damage.

The strategy needs extremely low positivity rate effective. true. one seen anti-maskers losing shit lately?

Violently attacking people. caring family friends die. Ignoring common sense logical requests socially distance wear masks. Fauci look mirror. Oh gotcha, wasn‚Äôt thinking thawing happening stage don‚Äôt like article? Facebook. We're fucked emotional idiots posting memes comparing masks chain link fences probably Hillary Clinton getting locked infect primates. humans interact much wild populations...

Polio would good example human specific virus. Lmao, gullible sheep think BLM anything POC human rights. Schengen-internal travel 'international' USA-internal travel. 

But yeah, anything beyond shut down. Also Schengen countries play ball, like Sweden. mean limited hospital beds isn‚Äôt really related fucked way paying healthcare. JonRedd12: 

I'm retired physician (internal medicine) returned assist health care providers pandemic. 

Being young healthy reduce severity odds dying virus. seeing demographic unhealed tissue damage organs nerves (and reduced organ functioning) 3-4 months post-discharge. seeing young people relatively high percentage (around 25%). still high risk someone age. 

Would still consider healthy lung function reduced even 10%? hope athlete. 

You age feel invincible. get it, there. think virus cannot cause permanent damage. dad non-white 40s really, really bad, Canada. thing sars wasn‚Äôt it? thought cases still immunity like decade later. People told March stop months. told thing May told thing July.

Just months. wear kn95 mask goggles, keep distance, risk low. Problem wirh ordering can't tell what's stock easily pick alternate items. stock displays accurate, might give try. state lowest number infections country, know risk catching outside low. ten feet idiots times.

It surprised rest hanging close guy. one said anything coughing (he covering mouth all) course none wearing masks. come one talking type national mourning?? 170,000 fellow Americans dead. families friends pain sure. 

We changed world 3000 dead 9/11. That‚Äôs true, aren‚Äôt equipped tools need properly help patient.

Unfortunately there‚Äôs much do. started therapy couple years ago ¬£70 every two weeks 1.5 hours couldn‚Äôt afford two months. 

I‚Äôve accepted life now. don‚Äôt energy left They‚Äôre welcome Canada would get flu vaccine?  wear n95 mask.  Taking 2 year old get flu vaccine seems risky.  kid cant wear mask doesnt leave house. come across huge douche. offense. mean, first bill dems originally ignored well adding bunch fluff would never passed. :( best luck I‚Äôve refused patients before, every right good charge nurse care unless time. Thank you! I'll check out. cells help make antibodies, antibodies bulk fighting immune response. 'common cold' caused 200 different viruses, 4 happen coronaviruses. Wow read article - believes vaccine decrease chances getting virus 50%. 

A rate low means huge percentage population needs vaccinated us get back normal probably keep mask laws effect years case. Travel also need carefully done, I‚Äôd expect anyone concerned infection travel years.

I can‚Äôt believe fucked are. one taking virus seriously anymore already need keep vigilant like 2 years. come night, weirder ones Compared Fall? Angel Fallen probably worse. Sweden basically done much jurisdiction allows them. can't use lockdowns like done countries. yes tactic view virus can't avoid lets minimize spread. competition early judge best tactic longer period. Slot focus Sweden also impact lockdowns etc.

I live Sweden people distancing life normal. sad many people died numbers looks rather similar places widespread infection close period.

There lot mistakes beeing made every country virus also showed lots weaknesses elderly care financed long time ""It's PEOPLE'S fault."" Classic. blame politicizing virus falls squarely POTUS himself. Every decision last 18 months getting re-elected. thing still going good economy inherited Obama chose super heat lowering interest rates artificially etc.. virus hit knew nothing restoke economy shutdown attempted preserve economy instead preserve human lives, end costing nations hundreds thousands lives, also tanked economy record time. propaganda machines trying make sound like whole covid-19 response political hit job POTUS. 

And even touching bats hit crazy lady saw CNN school board meeting claiming social distancing mask wearing pagan satanic rituals. imagine cold storage like walking freezer. Whoever loads takes breathing air small room virtually ventilation potentially preserves virus indefinitely. gets transported unloading process disperses virus air. person unloading probably wearing mask, especially one unloading. could fomite transmission could also see case virus inhaled. Especially know rooms PPE removed virus air surfaces. odds forever favour. I'll laughing end go grain. Hahahahahahahahaha think it‚Äôs huge relief somewhere go that‚Äôs dedicated virus. (I also check separate states‚Äô coronavirus subs, also covid19 sub scientific posts.)

My experience sub, especially past six weeks (had give doomscrolling rest bit), remarkably good. find people post something inaccurate, others tend come along refute it. 

If could, really wouldn‚Äôt change thing sub. jmho telling dont celebrate xmas in-laws? 

can coronvirus every year? Seeing actually catch covid die it, would expect deaths increase *even* cases started decline. heck would lie this??? No, said one wants admit POTENTIAL SOURCE spread. add *one* effective security measure response 9/11: reinforced, locked cockpit doors. Even passengers cooperate, pilots (and flight deck) inaccessible. might fulfill looking for...they tested multiple temperatures multiple surfaces. concerning would right infectious virus could detected treated smooth surfaces Day 4 (glass banknote) Day 7 (stainless steel plastic)

That means actual fomites, since infectious, detectable ***up 7 days*** steel plastic... ha, *Shhh* give ideas! source Sweden late reporting deaths compared countries? Condensed version: vast majority folks care ""fellow man"". Well feel like part aimed Sometimes think I'm going insane, reality, everyone around insane (some shit parents say makes depressed lose faith humanity).

Sorry I'm US Trump ever built big evil wall? many percent wall got built already? biggest hearts too. sons Spanish teacher saw back seat went pick Chrome book yelled name, could see behind mask eyes watered up. Granted elementary school aren‚Äôt complete brats yet, teachers genuinely miss kids. Can‚Äôt use form CBD/THC products, work. fair, permanent immunity anything flu vaccine shown provide little benefit older populations despite narrative like push older Americans get immunized every year. Agree disagree lol read beyond first paragraph might educate vaccination keep getting sick flu. vaccination reduce risk flu-associated hospitalization children, working age adults, older adults. vaccination important preventive tool people chronic health conditions. vaccine life-saving children. vaccination shown several studies reduce severity illness people get vaccinated still get sick. vaccinated may also protect people around you, including vulnerable serious flu illness, like babies young children, older people, people certain chronic health conditions.

Talk dimwitted. 

If people wore masks social distanced much possible even big issue anymore. bad republicans politicized point stupid = free. taking mild preventative measures stop spreading virus infringement anyone's freedom. stupid.  happened too. got sick late January/early February bad cough lingered month. Ever since I‚Äôve health problems almost every month govo er cause couldn‚Äôt breath body felt paralyzed. Doctor said anxiety attack got there. Feel like brainfog sometimes really tired. I‚Äôve panic attack nothing like that. expensive get check ups specialists need see figure what‚Äôs wrong. :(  Best summary! 100% agree.

Also teaching trades allowing people try trades younger age helps decide high school. College always answer. Trade schools get attention need way learn trade like would beneficial school still.

I'm sorry feeling hurt. idiot first wave less harmless mostly spread soldiers? becoming deadly that? Like nothing problematic U.S. troops going killing 15-20 million people first place.

What you, insane? 

Do know anything parties aggressors WWII? 

Where get ""15-20 million people"" killed ""US troops""? Ah yes... someone knows SUSD well... making right call. outbreak schools open employees wearing masks buildings many returned unnecessarily. locked higher percent go, slower death rate. less infected, useful masks social distancing. longer takes spread, time everyone get vaccinated. There's way reach level vaccine available. Probably even half that. shit Yeah, sure, people could also properly clean reduce Campylobacter, Salmonella, Clostridium too, hospitalization, deaths continue. someone works around hazardous substances, whole mask fetishism amusing. amulets ward evil. reasons follow rigorous protocols industry dealing toxic aerosols, fomites, screwing steps pretty much makes whole process useless. Better yet, ""Hi, I'd like turn in, committed murder."" ""Now hold right there, committing anything mask on. Come back take try again."" Canadian, I‚Äôm pretty sure is. alternatives don‚Äôt seem compelling. feel Hillary better opposition (and I‚Äôm Hillary fan).

Now, Michelle Obama run, would‚Äôve interesting. 2c someone directly impacted (nor opinionated) american politics. Heck don‚Äôt care Canadian politics either lol would Coronavirus used grab power? I‚Äôd say current issue USPS mail voting, feeling that‚Äôd happening even coronavirus maybe antibody tests unreliable? know people show antibody tests yet completely asymptomatic. Yet health issues, Coronavirus impacted severely. Phoenix lows 85¬∞ highs 110¬∞+. Welp looks like stupidity also endemic then. I‚Äôm lucky enough work home, you‚Äôre single entire existence exists waking up, getting PC 9 hours, spending evening alone it‚Äôs easy become depressed.

No, words looking *without income.* reason that's tied ""out work"" lot certain Senator sending Senate home month, rather let even vote financial relief people can't ...let alone delaying development children.

Oh damn good know! real LPT always comments Yes, can, read weeks back significantly ups death rate. think Americans anyway sacrifice greater good, applaud optimism  Lmao good way get rid social benefit leeches

/s know, social psychological perspective, people without guidance expect. Denial, fear anger. That's everyone, course, certainly, we're seeing reaction lot people. disaster-preparedness agencies run issue--how much tell public warn them, happens, people get desensitized, subsequently, non compliant.

From virological perspective (which give shit believe), earmarks becoming whopper Fall/Winter. honestly hope come that--wasn't it, like, one four people died Black Plague Europe? (I'm lazy look up). overdue cold, hard lesson consequences, rate non compliance we're at. Schools India Africa conducted outside hut! 100F.

That link shows Sweden's delay, say Sweden report 90% within 10 days. 


You simply make stuff thin air. 


Please prove wrong show bad Sweden's delay compared \_other\_ countries. (Third time:  source Sweden late reporting deaths compared countries?) Youd still bunch anti mask republicans saying fake. wonder effects we'll see 30 years. many future voters lost family recklessness, seen parents lose careers homes, suffered long-term health consequences childhood covid infection? respond explanation putting first academic achievement (i.e., future employability) important anything else? following ""wave"" model, though. flu tends recede regardless human intervention come back.

##""Stowing away elders probably good.""        
##An expert infection control corona times expresses coldly.
##It reveals condescending view elderly.     

When Aftonbladet publishes emails Swedish Public Health Agency experts Karolinska Institutet , emerges professor infection control March wrote corona times would probably good ""stow away oldest"".        
How one come heartless formulation? sounds like paraphrase old 60's monologue ""Bundle together"" Lars Ekborg.           
But realize exactly happened. Older Swedes stowed away homes, thousands stowed away mortuaries. large parts rest society gradually able start living usual.           
With lack compassion email reveals, shunned normal life left behind.          
I get lot emails life. Lotta, 73, thinks ""it feels like prison"".        
‚ÄúMy days start thought today? take walk right left? usually go right see traffic sometimes people. addition, dog kennel, watch dogs playing. pleasure ‚Äù.       
Those express disparagingly elderly midst corona pandemic familiarize like live alone apartment suburb, risk group told travel public transport.         
Should go right today, left?     
I receive email priest meets relatives lost elderly relatives without able visit several months. elderly died covid-19.       
‚ÄúOthers lost courage community family friends longer exists. awful‚Ä¶ young people able live pretty much usual, older people expected pay price loneliness fear ‚Äù.        
Now mental illness among 70-plus affects real heroes, involved stopping infection obediently stowing away, alone homes.       
A young man emails thinks parents, 70, probably die depression die corona. 65-year-old woman risk group writes wants try meet safe way, several friends completely terrified even walking door. left home times since March.       
It's horrible.       
In nursing homes, ""sea ‚Äã‚Äãdespair"", according Jan Melander, visit mother Gudrun, 82.      
Who sees this, shows care compassion?       
""It's tone awful,"" reader named Birgitta wrote May authorities' way communicating.         
Now get new email Birgitta. thinks ""Stow away"" gate reveals view elderly.          
""Now understand condescending tone comes from.""           
Lars Ekborg summed like this, macabre way:        
""Old people way, bundle together kill"". ones deserve die anyway. Never said Miller would run, saying already seeing example ""worse Trump"" could look like. worse version devious, cunning, intelligent.

Again, hope right, last time thought Trump win, won. course, Electoral College gave win. give hopes actually see losing November. #Noooooo. sexy hairüò¢üò¢  governor die jail. data came [from data? Wrong. say everyone else asleep. people support anyone trying wake general public. 

And i'm sorry believe opinion relevant plandemic. Good riddance, like said, good luck you. So??

Most people never die due terror attack. still fight terrorists.

Most people never die car accident, still rules safety roads.

We, example, even know herd immunity achieved reports people getting infected twice - stop tracks might become yearly thing, like flu.

I give fuck like wearing mask staying inside, really give zero fucks. behaving months sake infecting others, might die will, example, lose sense smell get brain damage, U.S might deal medical bill, literally shows kind person are.

During Blitz Brits turned lights off, one sitting like ""my apartment, rules"" keep lights get bombed German bomber. stupid, normal, empathetic human sense morality expect you. gave someone cookie told 2-3% chance killing grandparents frequently visit, think would take? gave cookie chance killing someone, would take it? also 5-10% chance resulting brain damage someone know, would take it? told you, taking cookie increased chance someone else also taking cookie getting food poisoning potentially killing someone, would take it? really hope wouldn't. would biggest asshole met long time borderline psychopath.

Just can't see, smell, taste virus mean different cookie. think may confusing correlation causation. 

Lots people poor critical thinking skills. 

Lots people religious. 

There‚Äôs lot overlap two large groups population. don‚Äôt think religion requires poor critical thinking skills, happen lot. USA's major industry hair-cutting, everyone would wearings masks ""muh economy""? group people buy shit infomercials My, vicious little snowflake. Every last word... knew days ago announced... article show concentration test results spread.  


  
üì∑[**Rebekah told reporter conspiracy theory sources inside told hiding cases leading July 4? ""found"" thousands cases weeks leading July 4. saying long term cell immunity thing? Go covidactnow dot com see actually increasing. vaccine 100% effective. Eradicating virus might take masks + vaccine infectiousness. Depending effective vaccine fraction population gets it. gradually everything go back normal. like global warming threat mankind?? ones seek discredit science form rational thought? guys???? germany could lose custody kids. would take someone really want mess you, basis there. That's completely absurd say flawed length. saying fewer pages would less flawed? 

How many pages ideal unflawed legislation?

No, flawed due massive Republican (and Democrat) opposition concessions made across board get passed. 

What's flawed legal system. point, people worst last line immigration. Boston here, got take cat outside one hour day Spring Yes. bet country still wearing masks. Masks seem effective flu. Given schools likely still closed open ones half kids time distanced...restaurants closed, people working home malls closed.....hard imagine flu getting foothold. Guess see. wish business illegal didnt buy services. promise moon give pie compensation, pay half first. first 1000$. 


its worse cars tbh, they're forcing pay 150$ month zero coverage, say piece paper wont get ticket - honestly ticket cheaper rub take car till get insurance it... cant even register without insurance... fact removed comment shows realize wrong downplaying disastrous pandemic is. either political rhetoric plain stupidity ignorance. I‚Äôll let decide politically directly related Republican Party. forehead scanning thermometers work well all. flu beginning March. took temp traditional thermometer right went Urgent care get tested, 100¬∞. Twenty minutes later, Urgent care used one forehead scanning ones said temp normal. nose swab came back positive influenza. get covid test bc right lockdown started, fill questionnaire asking Wuhan though. Dumb question, true 2nd wave guarantee covid? remain steady vaccine herd immunity hiits? Two things, options really have???

They take semester year attend school reduce services charge really think away ""religious studies"" professor ""Classics religion"" majors final straw???

You're thinking narrowly. product reduce quality product, generally charge less make another way want lose business. making claims pro-student nothing really support futures, going catch hear saying like current education system

Running operation piss-poorly mean think entire system bad. Although serious problems people going debt decades without reasonable assurance they'll see money it. Like said personal experience major pharmas evaluated developed candidates also screened generics preapproved. 

Repatenting generics new use cases done time. know say doesn‚Äôt work practice, actually business strategy several companies. don‚Äôt believe look use memantine already 40 years patent used Alzheimer‚Äôs. generic well known new use seriously money bank. 

It easy get VC money this, assets massively derisked since don‚Äôt Tox studies. RemindMe! 24 days what? living Australia, working Hong Kong migrants due change spent 6wks traveling US back Australia.

(Currently U.S.)

Tens days later 26yrs old;took knees. new. Clue double pneumonia first; within5 days onset. 

Wheezing heard across room.

The telltale shadows doctor confused af. (who seen China endemic Wuhan).
He knew dying lucky survived refusing admitted hospital (no child care) go every day exam, refills pneumonia physical therapy. Like half in/half out. 6wks felt better. 10wks could come doped codeine desperately trying dry lungs.

My doctor beyond frustrated.
Here's otherwise formerly young healthy patient signs cancer double pneumonia! still learning shadows lungs today. people keep long time others like clear within 12mo period. Forced volunteering volunteering. forced labor without pay. else forced labor without pay called?

That wrong even pandemic happening. People support children without forced labor school.

With pandemic, point get bodies confined area. ""solution"", know clearly, thinly disguised attempt make things spread faster. ""my rights"" person, believe right compel unpaid labor greater people's rights one obeyed. science man say anything people COVID outside coughing infectous.  sad last line is. 

My family wont stop parading 85 yr old nan partys. fear wont survive 2020. Arizona significantly less populated Texas Florida.  President Vladimir Putin said vaccine, developed Moscow‚Äôs Gamaleya Institute, safe administered one daughters. 
 
So Putin take vaccine himself. really one risks take. taken daughter store since probably February. want send school uncertainty procedures. take indoor play places anything like even though opening back up.

But, end day, young kid. can't keep cooped entire year. go playground house. wears mask, make sure touch face put hands mouth, sanitizes head home washes hands get home. two friends neighborhood know parents following procedures allow meet time time. also fully understand, though, others comfortable everyone parent best abilities. Ok... fecking feck...

&amp;#x200B;

I answering question colder temperatures affected spread covid specific cities specific time year.

At times, two cities - Bergamo, Italy; NYC, NY, hit hardest respective states/ countries.

Hence posted average temperatures two specific cities, shows significantly far apart.

Does make sense? Professor Sam Vaknin covered great deal material related youtube channel. recommend channel people like truth unvarnished without toxic optimism. think worth noting even virus came along mental health rather bleak place due myriad reasons including dizzying pace technology. quote Baudrillard live culture obscenity. Luckily enough, exact procedures stop spread Covid works influenza. family already shaming scolding *suggested* may make Christmas Thanksgiving. be. don‚Äôt understand people stupid. shit purpose point. PERFECT! LOL. guess able trace outbreak back people working airport case.

Prostitution could also spread this, given many circumstances people would admit spending time prostitute, would bridge infection groups would come contact normally way much harder see.

There also whole airborne spread issue, potential infection carry pollution particles tens km.  Indeed. Christmas gonna bleak man Let's let perfection enemy good. Please advertise herd immunity like that's viable path. 

COVID stumbles communities stay vigilant, wear masks, use mass testing, avoid large crowds. 
 
Vaccines obvious endgame, meantime, react world live in. New Zealand community transmission 100+ days. they've likely nipped outbreak bud. They're rightly worried this, see panicking. cautious concern review. 


Aka responsible gov't act. everyone goes bankrupt Lay facts without making recommendations. ""gestures broadly everything"" continue surf net play stupid video games die.....seems way go now...... bow respect. agree isn‚Äôt magic invariant number. [Which take account realize 60-80% way high Uhhh that‚Äôs science man said OK, wrong? substantial number parents threatened pull kids private schools went NTI, many areas, get NTI free public schools. Enrollment (and tuition revenue) would decline significantly. lying time not? It‚Äôs hard tell anymore. yeah, comment ""flowers attic"" vibe, real Yeah, schools reopen nationwide, hell going break loose. Look happening Georgia, Flordia, Indiana allready. even people die Putnam county allready, including teacher. Superhero name?......ManScape  trickle, yet? tried giving money billionaires? Except we're governed uneducated yokels NC restaurants, required report outbreaks. Probably global rule point.
Even report, simply "" thoroughly sanitize"" open next day Considering Trumo wipes ass constitution military swears oath constitution, actually legal moral obligation oppose him. That's professional football players payed millions year play. 

These kids arent payed anything.  costs 70 bucks petition signed like 50 people put name ballot state legislation. Next election cycle I'm running banner ""it's time start over"".

I idea I'm doing, not? not? people deciding afterall feel like might go plan populous state since plan would get biggest bang buck swabs appear accurate

So testing going get even painful Aww cute see defeatist can't understand simple math.

 # Poor Rich people Honestly case we'd open already. Everyone keeps ignoring fact overwhelming majority America lockdown since March. follow guidelines, wear masks. exceptions unfortunately go well America=Bad narrative much better fact we've done everyone else has. Thats great country, hope get day too. that's possibility foreseeable future. simple think look whats really happening here. 

As Americans need accept beat virus. stay there's nothing fix already tried. do? Stay locked vaccine finally released? dont see realistic option. need plan place full scale reopening. know going respond excess deaths caused that? would deaths either way probably exact amount. make us suffer longer outcome exact same? really reasonable concept understand. California largest economy U.S.; mix elite live area start. order make change push survival Human Species major things must fall place like city destruction, governmental collapse, mass loss life. pleasant thing, help ensure future mankind. say pressure needed. logical, pressure allows cook temperature 100^(o)C without water evaporating, water involved temperature need higher order melt synthetic parts mask. Iraqis Afghanis Americans using guerrilla warfare struck Ob\*ma Tr\*mp's drones. Got save babies May suggest take leaf 16-17 July 1918. Yeah, guess I'm saying lower paid workers insurance fact always barely make enough money survive reason tough strike. Society keeps (you) line making life wages hard enough can't even imagine going without wages. (soon) dead.

That tactic work salaried ""professional"" class, could go couple weeks without pay survive. system designed alternative methods keeping line... health insurance, they've come rely on, tied work threat losing that.

Just different way different groups held place. I'm saying ""right"" ways since professional class ""comfortable"", threats taking away stuff actually effective, they've become accustomed comfort. living poverty, however, used uncomfortable brink, likely risk things protest. seems.

Comfort dangerous effective control essentially getting at. Clearly role Mario Lopez, gotta positivity smile! Someone Facebook feed posted worried 10 kids going back school contracting covid trusts wear mask, wash hands social distance. college kids can't trust two three things expects two kids 10 college kids can't do. God knows enough that. analysis shows instances junk highly politicized health news information minimal, content received far engagement form comments type videos: around 9,000 comments per million views. Another arresting finding channels public health institutions NHS rarely, ever, returned search results. Personally I'm eating rich. Cover corn syrup cut heads off? Yes maple syrup, let‚Äôs replace walk shame 10 minutes small closet hungry, meth addled wolverines. state decide extent. 50 states much wanted mention article potential repercussions people evacuating hurricane. currently happening, study. however likely happen Florida gets category 3 higher storms require evacuation frequently. need go. Every single one. need complete overhaul- new people- whole new culture. Fair enough either fishing fish fry day sling .22 shoulder hopefully get enough stew Idk declaring full war enormous ask.

If military says steps aside, president fucked. Yes we‚Äôre talking Americans  Here's latest case/death charts 7-day deaths around 150. So, math, week Florida break 10k deaths.

Currently Florida 41.95 deaths per 100k population, ranking 18th country. Ironically, comments like self-fulfilling prophecies.... Senate. absolutely nothing Tijuana (which from) non-US citizens can't go US anyways, people crossing border right people commute Tijuana San Diego come back home afternoon, city mandate absolutely zero stop border traffic mandate, enforced. Damn GLaDOS! facing unmanned drones, Viet Kong bombs dropped dropped ww2, still won. prefer dipping bleach. see argument sides. 

The reality is, military would probably splinter well. Trump made friends amongst military brass, im sure even youre casual grunt would give pause ordered fire crowd Americans. Yeah, house. Pretty obvious. sides blame. Don‚Äôt point finger yell one side. Stop voting cults office won‚Äôt recess issue. House Representatives adjourned two weeks ago. look mcconnell see weak, ugly, man - man likely bullied taken seriously childhood, dedicated whole life attaining power simply sole purpose making everyone's lives even 1/10th miserable his. state equal representation Senate.

I think that‚Äôs point made, that‚Äôs wild concept. leads situations millions people thousand acres measurably less power Senate (where half Congress‚Äôs responsibilities lie) millions acres land thousand people.

It works situations, others. instance, Senate SCOTUS appointment confirmation powers means groups aiming sweeping policy changes Supreme Court way smaller amount people need target less populated states get way Senate.

It‚Äôs bizarre setup, seemingly tonedeaf needs country going 250 years road. Especially we‚Äôre watching openly gamed directly front us. Ask Browns, Packers, Bills lol gonna strike dont job CDC really leaning role project managers work telling others work them. longer expected. Yeah. I'm Texas. husband (and 2 kids) pretty much ones families trying stay home go necessary (i.e. groceries).

Both mom dad asked us stuff like come so's birthday go lake house whatever.

My 93 yr old grandpa moved community retirement home letting anything. moved regular house. Well, kinda felt like overpaying retirement village anyway. maybe better way. extras paying (thru rent) provided anymore (like cafeteria lunch dinner weekly movies).

My husband tell mother yesterday would joining sister's birthday Sunday. I'll soon telling dad going lake house Labor Day wknd.

So yeah. Sucks around.

I used put conservative conspiracy bullshit because, ya know, whatever. thoughts taxes that. we're facing something that's literally life death and/or life long internal injuries, going figure soon enough husband conservative all. marketing definitely downfall! best promote Instagram, ""influential"" personality others do... mention I've finding social media kinda bad mental health lately, time try avoid whenever possible. appreciate offer help! I'll using etsy I'm ready start selling work. Thank you! understand quite okay, think that‚Äôs fucking silly modern times. It‚Äôs anti-democratic (meaning democracy party) protects interests wealthy rural white people everyone else (by design since created protect slavery). 6% decrease global pandemic that's killed hundreds thousands... thats much decrease.

Also notice Harleys there. Yea smarter riders buy bikes cheaper, faster, lighter, run look better(Yamaha, Kawasaki, Suzuki) smart arent going shit. That's starting ask people draft plans. guess plans test run- chose large populous state, rural state, older tourist driven state, large diverse city. want see priorities capable of. use potentially figure national plan. this, actually good idea. weird ok day work home stuff lie hits - what's happening. really getting better. wtf happening lives right now?!? can't give people handouts! way!  make walk shame without head.

And do-nothing senators worried people going back work... would could fucked covid response much, going back work happening anytime soon. 

And get another vacation, fucking one.

How working government numbers regarding COVID already lied, time time again. honestly still falling non-sense? 0.26% death rate.

Better stay inside forever! Quarantine fatigue. People can‚Äôt last like forever let‚Äôs borrow Flanders‚Äô RV go steal damn tree back! There‚Äôs doings transpiring! mean ridiculous putting kids risk Yeah shit!

(No mierda, suppose. Well fucked one up) Plus, athletes people families too. won‚Äôt say, beta test only. Guessing nobody wants try experimental stuff post vaccinations administrators aren‚Äôt overworked? South Carolinians never made paperwork mistake recorded history? It‚Äôs conspiracy? There‚Äôs COVID stamp coroners use injects bleach money hospitals veins?

Something like that, right? missed point completely. Whiffff shouldn‚Äôt interject conversation; ... perspective slaves incredibly recent one. use slaves commonplace many, many ‚Äòhealthy‚Äô societies, societies we‚Äôre taught believe healthy. We‚Äôre talking millennia slavery. Greece, Rome, basically conquered land ever.

There may something unique import slaves across ocean; but, slaves ... kinda staple societies maybe last 500 years so? sub outright calling forced vaccinations yet, quite yet? glue piece fabric filter one see it, doesn‚Äôt matter fabric ‚Äúfiltering‚Äù virus? horse rider?  forget Common Sense! Oh, hell no! made bed lie it, asshole. Sooo people dying oh great testing? Dems letting GOP get away murder. lost spine. genome sequenced new cases already determined look like NZ first wave, matches strain UK. would simply impossible virus still present 100 days without single person presenting symptoms needing hospital care. single family already found 13 positive cases one already needed hospital level care. fail infect all, try, try again.

We states walled rest world set bench mark measured, nice avoidance, bad excess 5500 dead Sweden Inaccurate.

If teacher gets covid, class quarantined 2 weeks. 
If two students class get covid within 2 weeks other, entire class quarantined two weeks regardless whether get 
If 10 students school get covid within two weeks, entire school quarantined 2 weeks.
This year going hot mess starts stops. Parents even begun understand frequent school disruptions going year. Didn‚Äôt COVID hit Southern Hemisphere winter? happens national strategy convince people won‚Äôt 400k dead Americans 2020. Americans call ... == hashtag trends know least personally are. fiance staying inside much possible happy situation university putting us Eh..no. letting people choice must. need create strawman arguments. None saying said. 

It's simple: Government lock innocent citizens will? answer no. I'm really shocked anyone agree that. 

Should NZ Government ask people want voluntarily shipped quarantine facility? Yes, should. voluntary, mandatory. it‚Äôs usually football coaches making most, even top researchers doctors. Pathetic... case get reinfected body fights better, still potential disease vector, means acquired immunity stop massive outbreaks occurring. hope fall window. Hurricane season could also displace millions Southern US already worst hit Covid. one credible (mis)interpreting are.

You bet losing, dying horse. guess that's trouble well early. People get lackadaisical spreads fast gets foothold. Nah, spent 7 months Reddit Twitter bragging better America. Literally today: also misinterpreted Fauci said flu difficult get. low level transmission compared COVID stuff like social distancing masks. means 3 months plus minus 3 months. Thats CDC accuracy. Yes!! MAGA masks still huge thing? I've seen one two, come on, would simple way get nose-dick crowd wear them. could genius campaign insist making political. ""The l1b5 want wear mask?? Well show them!!"". would wearing masks droves. know what, may buy one start trend i'm (very right wing area). could literally save lives town North Dakota per capita alcohol consumption. coincidence outbreak. 

You won‚Äôt see growth BYU. drink, students themselves. Don‚Äôt worry üòÇüòÇüòÇ check out? vaccine may developed tested logistics getting distributed nightmare, mention enough supplies administer Yeah spending hours breathing room putting mask... ideal 100% agree. another upvote since system allowed give one. ‚¨ÜÔ∏è no, ""shut down"" summer. lots things going on.

If want help art business. I‚Äôve taught web design. 

My problem don‚Äôt like market myself. I‚Äôd rather spend time creating next thing. Thanks future premonition. wear mask bro charge realized decades ago long crush third party candidates together, pit population get away anything. long two party system, never sniff democracy again. Sorry, Sweden-Finland discussion here. 

Feel free post somewhere else though. example, convince threat re-election.

It is. That's GOP (not Trump, culpable) actively working sabotage election. Organize movement spend next decade union organizing blitz.

I honestly think 10 years. think November last chance. know that's kind Debbie Downer truly believe. coming someone ""safe"" state I'll probably alright personally. can't even imagine like someone unemployed struggling state safety net raging COVID-19. Dude american medical research community agree you. Leading scientist covid research agree you. Click CDC link gave above. read yourself. epidemiologists believe measuring excess deaths is¬†[the best assess impact virus real time.

Source 
 say? get become political country researchers like Steven Woolf, director emeritus Virginia Commonwealth University‚Äôs Center Society Health Richmond

affected politics? trust american researchers trust worldometers site. Why? people better understanding situation rely outdated/ false numbers provided goverments might political interest hiding numbers simply right data yet.

And I'm sorry US report covid deaths many more. many already sufficently registering covid deaths. like never ever adress fact many countries never provide truthful numbers area yet trust covid numbers? that? 

If sincere disscussion (which gather likley not). check CDCs numbers yourself. hace take word anything atleast try stay withing realms reality. Saying 'Sweden one highest covid deaths per cap' true *in reality*. dishonest know it. first wave 90% new cases came within households workplaces. Since workplaces close immediately someone tests positive leaves households vast majority transmission. nearly impossible avoid happening even every precaution. time new person home gets it, 14 day clock re-starts them. wave 1 households quarantine 46 days according Director General Health. system prevent that, shorten time restrictions save lives. WAIT THATS RAIN! Pretty expensive lose technicians sure? What's universities operating cost what's revenue..In words, what's profit? flu Covid sounds like bad combo.

So here's get - flu usually bad, that's WITHOUT COVID-type measures taking. flu spread easily, social distancing masks could mostly wipe out. 

We seeing int Southern Hemisphere currently ""flu"" season, btw. Flu waaaay down. know how, would like comment gif someone banging head wall. signs? You‚Äôre making things up. I‚Äôm posting actual experts‚Äô thoughts you‚Äôre wishfully thinking. help ""Unproven"" Speak yourself, 'women'. woman, country male circumcision norm, would rather man mutilated without consent.  I'm cynical too, even cynical moods recognize owners still want flock cattle fit working. testing affordable, easily prevalent accurate, could social interactions. I'm sure Fauci absolutely needs advanced data working with. give call? 

Is perhaps know deep ""but done seent Reddits!"" substitute actual critical thinking?  single person church choir Oregon spread 20 people less hour. 

That church still meeting person calling governor fascist.  Agreed. We‚Äôd need national strike fund. I‚Äôd suggest start call organized labor strike September 1st demand Senate called back session. 14.6 million unionized employees 2019. job hunting right now. signs point reinfection possible stop objectively saying don‚Äôt know (or anybody). Especially say need data. End discussion. Yeah less 10 cases... got ACA coverage. pay absolutely everything full. Even though job source income. tell you? mostly densely populated areas. We've 4 cases total, contained. people wear gear. see someone go without mask stay like 50+ feet away wait till come out.

This mostly large city problem. Rural suburbs farm lands fairly well.

Most population USA live cities. imo, we'll see peak soon. 35 years Sandy Sarantis served nurse family friends say caring people passion ended ultimate sacrifice Sandy contracted coronavirus later died.  
  Even grieving, Sarantis said wants celebrate sister‚Äôs sacrifice also bring awareness selfless healthcare heroes too.  (some) evangelical leaders think Trump. don‚Äôt know others, tend cold weather changes. I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôll take opportunity test people slap covid label ppl. us willingly take first wave even yet. 2nd wave coming fall. there's lull worsening, things still go shit real quick careful. always linear decline virus.

However, don‚Äôt think really print recipients plasma already stage significant infection. (Although antibody therapy effective sooner given infection, deal possibly developing significant immunity.) scare tactics getting old. America. awful nobody leaves. Long lines get in. people deported cry lives ruined. Leftists fight open borders let many millions come every year. 

So awful, I'm telling you, comrade Karen. Dreadful.

Get fucked leftist reddit. Get. Fucked. Can't somebody nuke Coronavirus? about: ""Competing hospital beds they'll pay tens thousands dollars 'win'""? Yes, thank you, previously aware that. Thanks enlightening information. even going coronavirus alone, excess deaths going insane of:

1. Suicides

2. Overdoses

3. Flu

4. Starvation

5. Assaults  eh....I think medical community communicated great deal regarding virus. issue willful ignorance full blown lying positions power, mention surprising stupidity fellow Americans. see term sheeple one time regards people wearing masks PROTECT OTHERS much themselves, might lose it. paint parts black. made great contributions. virus survives longer cold conditions. frozen meat.

This bad Brazilian US meat producers. Well, feel reassured. Damn honestly depressing. I‚Äôm college freshman whose school went online fall likely spring. glimmer hope start sophomore year might even happen, plus online classes suck ass. It‚Äôs insane much control still ended scenario Hah, place used work getting new job completely abandoned masks taking precautions already. even offer benefits, pay hourly (except made bunch people salary, wage bump, make OT). said, wish places simply gave fuck, good friend works place, I'm terrified going get sick, get parents sick, etc. Sadly, they've upwards 5 cases already, keep hidden employees best can. send someone home, never even follow testing anything. Yep, went getting immediately either fast going. I'm sure felt need post this. opinion CDC ""exaggerating/ignorant""? 


And so, medical and/or scientific credentials may know source trust? Guess we're going yo draw names hat. Obviously don‚Äôt temps low, think could probably make work days. barely send kids school indoors gets cold. hope said case. concern wonder vaccine say 50% effective level effectiveness flu shot get Covid annually multiple times year gotten Covid life long lingering symptoms? becomes case see ever traveling plane going concerts movies. want lifelong effects virus like toting around oxygen tank double lung transplant. anxious see future hold long term effects Covid determine new normal be. Done carefully, BLM protests don‚Äôt spread disease. 

Done carefully, going beach spread disease. bet one find examples beach going result rise cases. 

So question whether BLM protests done way spread covid? not, deserve criticized way anything else. Grocery stores longer allow people inside. hire employees take list get items enter ahead time internet pick up, put fresh produce outside tents people select outside, etc... employees safer infection. Finning teachers pandemic? thinking Arizona? aware. also 4 years ago. also events last year really showed opposition be... people know thought were.

I'm saying Trump win, im saying dont pretend can't win liked/policy. doesnt something wrong, win. Redfield trump appointee....anything says take grain salt. data actually true, insurance makes money paying pool money. People keep paying premiums, don‚Äôt go doctor, makes sense would money. Hey, that's opinion. believe humans autonomous refuse blame someone responsible personal actions forced do. give two shits president that's everyones go-to problems country beyond stupid cop-out.  primary spark plug flu season kids returning school (in US) fall. Guess states hell-bent doing? Shit, caught finished high school. it‚Äôs EVERYTHING built since then. respites great wars early 20th century. last 50-60 years, it‚Äôs nothing social, political, religious, educational, environmental discourse, chipping away democratic republic. Building other, decade decade. Like water dripping stone, stone last long. writing walls friends. American Empire truly decline, unknown decline lead us. Water needs get treated, costs money would drain city/town pay. Would cost much taxes long run.
Food grown, family farmers many generations need pay bills also, yes, pay food.
Medicine cheaper countries proved absolutely need 4000x markup like drugs. yes, pay them.
Housing paid someone owns building needs pay maintenance, taxes, things. 

Help paying two different things. Counter-intuitively, we'd probably handle lot better killed 24 hours. difficulty Covid (one them) contagious without symptoms long (days/weeks), clogs hospitals weeks per person. whole political system failed. control president congress that's ceded authority since bunch empty suits.

It‚Äôs actually great metaphorical protest one gets hurt - loss extravagant play toy. Sure, maybe captain loses job, fuck debase work monsters.

Please, start thinking rationally. Stop basing opinions emotion fear. Why? Every timeline date bullshit. get sick make anti bodies. vaccine work differently creating anti bodies cells. cells live longer body hence vaccine better sickness. give since last week Trump called Twitter. world ending m8 taste happen bunch schools reopen. Trump basically attempting coup de tat everything stop elections become defacto dictator.

So yeah, someone please invade USA liberate us GOP? Uh federal government 2 months (if more) paying hospital per room set aside covid. people posting giant hospitals 2 3 patients inside. doctors nurses let go, etc etc. open rooms get guaranteed payment government see anyone.

Pangolins anteaters. Derrecho gonna impact well. almost like could also choose visit establishment oh wait they're fucks. would great news Texas beginning reach peak. Here's hoping reductions coming weeks. say it‚Äôs intelligent choice vote candidate. So. What's best way end them?

Surely appeasing protestors would best way know summer camp that, turned one (out 150 teens) false negative. 150 got virus within 10 days. Thankfully one got really sick, false negatives still thing Nah gotta get experience world more.

For early summer first started job, barely awesome. I‚Äôve relapsed work slowed necessarily scary initially seems. immune response many diseases also sharp decline neutralizing antibodies - lose immunity, neutralizing antibodies weapon immune system's arsenal. There's also B-cells (which produce new antibodies needed) T-cells (which destroy infected cells they're turned little virus factories). Many early COVID-19 research papers documented low antibody counts recovered patients explicitly concluded would mean another immune mechanism must play important role well. One extreme example multiple sclerosis patient whose medication regimen completely blocked antibody production, hospitalized moderate-to-severe case, still recovered, without single antibody (most likely using T-cells alone). vaccines currently late testing phases designed elicit antibody T-cell immunity too.

Parts ""normal life"" probably different pandemic - perhaps handshakes become less culturally ubiquitous, example, perhaps open-plan offices go fashion. historically people ended establishing everyday life feels like everyday life (even exactly identical pre-pandemic counterpart) SARS, Spanish Flu, smallpox outbreaks Black Death. assuming that. Exactly, republic fall long ever reality. It‚Äôs pipe dream. Great American Schism almost here, ready. Go figure people facing pandemic recession (though probably closer depression point). top society's primary distractions taken away well. movie theaters, sports, bars clubs. People never introspective ever questioned society general first time. course shits depressing bingo Someone save Alyssa Milano. Probably

But I'm sure parties still going somewhere thing convince deniers severe casss family members. That's best response excited hundreds thousands Americans dying? Ok... let's cut mortality rate half accommodate bullshit still 300,000 lives lost.

The United States embarrassed handling this. powerful nation world, booming economy home great scientific minds. Yet overwhelming majority people decide Sean Hannity knows better epidemiologist. It‚Äôs joke. Sure agree last part getting team.

But unless playing single person sport next Jordan/Kobe/Lebron going carry team far. 

A lineman, receiver safety (any position) football able win games themselves. left fielder 2nd baseman might able score runs needs team defense. trying competitive teamwork. flawless? No. 

As discipline disagree maybe see could make argument people. However, time practice remain competitive, practice team coaches requirements. completely undisciplined many times struggle. Therefore stand argument teaches discipline. (If already discipline probably gain much though)

As selfishness yes agree true. look cases per million worldometer, 10 states worse California. People think Sweden success. right wing pundits FB talk Sweden every day. Hell even Ron Paul used respect him. ignore Sweden's economy tanked they're sitting 9% unemployment, better position.

They rely people understanding Sweden gone full surge. Explaining cultural differences like single generation households vs multi-generation even multi-family flies heads. First, written cofounder company involved treatment.

Edit: oh, junkie West Virginia. Shocking.  It‚Äôs constantly mutating. That‚Äôs younger people getting sick. 

They say new covid strains every 3 months (it‚Äôs cycle). virus constantly evolving may randomly evolve deadly, may evolve deadly all. 


The Spanish flu pandemic ended virus evolved much deadliest illness much less contagious. yeah went Cabo yet one talk monumental human trafficking issue Please show peer-reviewed study says Covid19 stop spreading 20% population immune. virus fairly highly contagious. report everyone expecting. Basically, Covid behave like viruses people memory cells provide long-term immunity protection, even antibody levels fade, body would able mount immune response quickly encounters virus again. expected great confirmation.

**Summary:**

Thus, performed longitudinal assessment individuals recovered mildly symptomatic COVID-19 determine develop sustain immunological memory virus. found recovered individuals developed SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG antibody neutralizing plasma, **as well virus-specific memory B cells persisted, cases increased numerically three months following symptom onset.** Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2-specific memory lymphocytes exhibited characteristics associated **potent antiviral immunity: memory cells secreted IFN-Œ≥ expanded upon antigen re-encounter, memory B cells expressed receptors capable neutralizing virus expressed antibodies.** findings demonstrate mild COVID-19 elicits memory lymphocytes persist display functional hallmarks associated antiviral protective immunity.

We also higher death rates per million inhabitants USA Brazil, two countries Swedish media unanimously happy accuse lousy corona strategy.          
        
**Yet is** extent catastrophe currently taking place country want sink in. One reason may many get ill therefore worry much.         
      
But also, right left, increasingly wild opinions say disaster really disaster happening Sweden really worse countries.         
        
And weapon, well-known seduction trick picked up; start quasi-debate, screw debate far away really about.           
          
**One early** Swedish quasi-debates launched claim Swedes travel therefore become vulnerable, ie completely natural, much argue about.        
         
But difference travel marginal also takes place close one hundred percent today's spread within country.          
           
Another quasi-debate going weeks dead registered deceased ""with"" ""by"" covid-19.         
               
Aha, say disinformation people driving quasi-debate forward, probably 6,000 died something else. Case thus closed, covid-19 forget.         
       
As doctor Benjamin Kalischer Wellander shown Dagens Medicin, almost cases reasonable doubt coronary infection caused patent's death, whether says ""off"" ""with"". figures internationally comparable.         
         
**Another quasi-debate** proportion 70-plus people among died covid-19 high country Nordic region look at. worry. Norway Sweden - difference.        
            
But course explain Norway 256 dead Sweden almost 6,000.         
            
**A variant** quasi-debate claim died old fragile would still died little later 2020.            
       
So covid-19 neither done seen full year.       
         
Against said group died Sweden belong group older fragile far twice large whole group covid dead Norway.       
       
Due large spread infection, succeeded keeping mortality among belong old group.         
          
The danger disinformation quasi-debates spread slowly take general conceptual picture.           
          
As Tage Danielsson's monologue Swedish nuclear power supporters accident Harrisburg nuclear power plant clearly states: ""It mean happened Harrisburg incredibly unlikely, really happened.""        
         
**If today's quasi-debates** continue, eventually hear similar theses corona pandemic. ""It never happened"", ""It depends count"", ""In retrospect see Sweden best"", nonsense.        
         
But happened happening right now. Sweden suffered terrible catastrophe, Norway, Denmark, Finland Sweden.       
         
We let death find way nursing homes, see areas exclusion working class exposed death covid-19 white-collar middle-class people work home.            
          
**How these** power relations groups colored death toll?        
           
The National Board Health Welfare points spread disease elderly care varies greatly regions country.         
       
The fact bourgeois-ruled region Stockholm's extreme cuts health care caused mortality covid-19 completely explode precisely within Stockholm's elderly care therefore examined detail.          
            
In column NSD, Norrl√§ndska Socialdemokraten, Kommunal's chairman Tobias Baudin writes number people fixed-term employment within Kommunal's agreement areas 238,800 people. almost many people living whole Norrbotten.           
             
We need map affects spread infection many temporary employment driven job job.       
            
**Among success factors** fight coronavirus agency IVO, Swedish Health Care Inspectorate, established ""close clear leadership"" ""daily reconciliations guidelines routines communicated employees"".         
           
How go first-line managers, talking here, Sweden's heavily dismantled public sector today responsible one hundred employees, especially women-dominated departments.          
        
**Another success** factor fight covid infection is, according IVO, ""strengthen routines around washing work clothes"".         
       
How go bourgeois region Stockholm, KD-controlled majority elderly care home care said even building changing rooms home care staff?       
            
The quasi-debates effectively put lid real issues. Many quasi-debates driven bourgeois politicians want take responsibility dismantled employment protection cuts staff resources.        
            
**But quasi-debates are** also **driven** supporters L√∂fven government, see every remark soaring Swedish death toll attack government. Therefore, discredit every new report number deaths.         
              
Closing quasi-debates necessary order meaningful discussion. addition, must humbly leave trenches polarization.            
          
But order get good basis immediate future measures, must first acknowledge obvious: Sweden failed. catastrophe befallen country. Nearly 6,000 people died. That's awful. Click-batish headline amigos. 
So, I‚Äôm totally board prevention safe. Wear damn mask. However post, title misleading. Basically article saying ‚Äòget flu shot‚Äô, headline replies makes look like cdc already saying fucked degrading worst case scenarios. Literally article saying flu season Rona, it‚Äôs going hard, get flu shot. y‚Äôall even read replied? Stay safe everyone. thought that? heard trump cultist saying that. Anyone knew anything (ie: nurse above), knew weather shit bullshit. time test show 25% way beyond that. right. disease kills significant portion hosts quickly would tight window opportunity spread new hosts. 

&amp;#x200B;

Covid long incubation period ability spread asymptomatic carriers, makes one insidiously effective viruses terms ability spread new carriers silently without detection.

&amp;#x200B;

Spanish flu likely unknown number asymptomatic carriers well, since regular influenza see every year also ability, since incubation period much shorter progression sniffles ARDS quick, symptomatic carriers would incapacitated pretty soon developing symptoms. Oh ya *that's* south getting destroyed Apparently heading out? 

Obviously 40-60% effective vaccine would better nothing lockdowns shutdowns talking about? vast majority country open business using CDC guidelines try protect people? 

If could effectively protect 50% population continue wear masks social distance virus would gone time.

The point flattening curve overwhelm hospitals try limit spread much possible. Yes will. Especially money pay utility bills. know right places, unbearably hot. get disconnected, could easily die. facing feeling. stuck home incredibly depressing. Got bike go daily bike ride change life!

I‚Äôm prepping file bankruptcy, everything that‚Äôs going right now...I‚Äôm scared something else happen (like hospital bills) I‚Äôll debt filing. Yes, even implementing better testing would make world difference. globalization mistake yet infections deaths Sweden plummeted weeks fail exactly?

The highest infection rate per capita Europe, 5th rate death per capita Europe (soon higher Italy), 5800 deaths, 5 10 deaths cases direct neighbours, know many patients long term effects...     
Not mention fact Sweden damage countries Europe. like vaccinate prejudice everybody Sweden damage every countries took measures.
Just daily infection rate (1 month countries Europe) little inferior April enough call success. /s there, still argument incompetence.

Here pure malice, like purposefully providing help even interfering blame Democratic governors mishandling it. even thought ""wait, many innocent people die"". means excess deaths attributable Covid far higher 200,000, maybe multiples it. That's also counting thousands old people, shut-ins, etc... died one knows yet. community, several reports people found dead homes weeks contact. wow us without jobs living isolation losing chances starting families want fucking die? way. need trailer hold bodies covid test results returned. covid, process things determine cause death.

It's like bodies piling many people passing (yet), especially since ~250 covid deaths total. states fly mark one day. function lag time getting test results back proceed, I'm really curious long takes test results come back.

Still, commend right classifying deaths accurately. Gotcha gotcha kids parents would let take gap year rather sending school not. least that‚Äôs read it.

TYRANNY!! said himself, takes responsibility.

How could Americans seriously voted mentally deficient toddler? Unfortunately, even spare population much everyone gathers stores/restaurants/together every awhile. I've noticed lot rural areas, people live there, tend smaller groups, closer. They'll hang out, eat together, whatever groups often.

Couldn‚Äôt done without your

God help us Covid mutates something like that. see sides sure.

I'm basing opinion see locally, factoring outside events. 

I'm probably wrong, 6 months ago anyone think would situation? 

I pretend know going happen, hoping best preparing worst. think replying wrong guy ""I one awake, listen me!""

Generally statement said ill informed incredibly emotional. Done carefully, BLM protests don‚Äôt spread disease. largest rally city seen years BLM June still managed clock 100 days without community spread, rally right middle, another smaller rally 4 July. hope counting vaccine eliminate COVID?
