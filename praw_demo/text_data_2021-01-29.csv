0,2021-01-29,"  That‚Äôs crazy NYC everyone wears masks. people wearing shields safe. yeah wonder fuzzed AstraZeneca vaccine. threaten war UK lol. rabies absolute maximum amount disease. haven‚Äôt able find info anywhere. analysis done 468 symptomatic cases occurred. wouldn‚Äôt expect handful deaths. thought herd immunity couldnt happen since vaccinated people could still spread virus County population 2.47M Confirmed Covid cases: 0.270M. Total cases assuming 4.6 multiplayer: 1.242M. *Estimated infection: 50%. *

Are going assume multiplier decrease time like paper? math 10M LA county get almost conclusion ~40% infected.

Look, highest positivity rate California overall 14.2% (unique tests). highest 7 day rolling average positivity rate Los Angeles county around 22%. Let's say positivity rate entire pandemic. 1,072,412 positive cases since beginning pandemic LA county. 4.6x amount (4,933,096), positivity rate 22%%, minimum population size LA county would 22,423,163, roughly 2.25x population LA county. course, 22% entire pandemic. That's maximum rate. Lower values increase population size needed account lower positivity rate. math work out. 

And, way, CDC data continually revised downward. 91 million cases September 2020 multiplier factor 7.2 reported December. 
 83 million cases December... 

Other recent estimates using serological data derive multiplier show around 1/2 CDC shows mid November. 
 lastly, remotely relevant, expected double peak corresponding increase mobility holidays. cases peaked December 15th dropping December 31st. increase mobility holiday season lead increase cases second peak January 8th. immunity playing role here, expect see second peak. 

In summary, math work positivity rate, multiplier decreases time paper, CDC data revised (and almost certainly continue given CDC cited JAMA paper weekly science updates), serological data indicates smaller multiplier factor, secondary peak simply immunity played significant role reduction cases. There's much working immunity theory much everything explained much better decreases mobility without resort bad math magic. Petco awesome large

By large  Yeah, monkeys *didn't* fly butt? Like, long think would last there? typewriters, expect shit Shakespeare's Greatest Hits? guys free healthcare? get revived local hospital instead? Can‚Äôt wait till summer ! US's vaccine distribution goes planned, Canada hitting #3 extremely likely. Come July US hoping massive oversupply vaccine. palestinians? die according plan?

A 3,300 drop today US hospitalizations. 3% total one day, that's uncommon last two weeks. that. US provided countries grants turn-up US-based manufacturing capabilities, provided support via DPA. US investing heavily domestic vaccine manufacturing. Kids can't vote they'll last Source? Ah, can‚Äôt get appointment 70+ parents. California really messed up, we‚Äôre far US average vaccinations. Covid Tracking Update: I've back person since June. kids wear masks half day eating nap time. work one state live another. work, phase started yet contacted. live, phase projected start date. Going work riskiest thing do, I'd really love get ball rolling vaccinating teachers thing. guys TWIV think booster every five years. Redditdurs endlessly complaining Trump using Defense Production act. Well is. guy fricken wacko. actually enjoy people show true colors add banned list never read insane thoughts again.  think EU felt fooled AZ cheated contract AZ knew could fulfill. AZ show serious delivering many doses possible EU, things well might cool down. 66% efficacy stellar. monkeys flew butt? 

Hey, I‚Äôm asking questions. Thats Canadian way. prick  guess trump right something .... all, wants vaccine success rate 72% versus Pfizer Moderna vaccines, rate 94-95%.

Never mind J&amp;J vaccine showing 85% efficacy severe disease 100% protection hospitalization death. general public heard 72% compared 94%. everybody knows ‚ÄúA‚Äù student much better ‚ÄúC‚Äù student.

Dr. Richard Marlink, director Rutgers Global Health Institute, said can‚Äôt think way, three reasons:

Any vaccine better vaccine;
The testing period vaccines different ‚Äî it‚Äôs exactly apples-to-apples comparison;
We still don‚Äôt know length effectiveness vaccines ‚Äî six months many years?  joke article. contract states begin delivering vaccine approved though, think they'd probably argue required stockpile vaccine, rather start deliveries EU sites soon approved. means vaccines going UK wu subject restrictions vaccines coming eu UK night (will based news earlier) Fuck general population right? Going store...I‚Äôm fast possible. sinus issue start gives raging headache literally 15-20 minutes. Outside I‚Äôm low density area there‚Äôs people. lived city I‚Äôd never leave house. rise digital age reason lockdowns feasible first place.

If pandemic happened 2000 2010 personal computer became norm, things probably would‚Äôve gone lot differently Exactly, basically get Denzel Washington, Obama, Tiger Woods, also this, 

(although bet Obama already got vaccinated, one perks president ;) ) 90% efficacious vaccine never seen lmao triple masks üò∑  &amp;#x200B;

one guy shovel move little dirt year.

give million people shovels move mountains year.

&amp;#x200B;

for vaccines - 

hours times brains

(+ lot dollars) Coronavirus much lower mutation rate influenza though. get control, good chance wont need booster frequently flu vaccine. imperative vaccinate quickly possible countries. 2 3 ain‚Äôt bad tone changed substance. hope means problems last days solved.

Nowhere say that. still ship much less EU hoping for. merely promises future soothe EU's rage. lot stake country NIAID NIH falls incompetent hands covid. Fauci realized directly contradicting Trump would nothing get fired replaced nut job.

Nobody could change trajectory Trump charted covid. Would make sense also let existing programs asthma, cholera, ebola, hiv/aids diseases go people working hospitals critical infrastructure.

&amp;#x200B;

Right situation dire, right antivaxx nurse say without risk fired. sure. Moderna 5% chance catching COVID anyway. J&amp;J 34% chance catching anyway.

Anyone tries pass shot big win trying pull wool eyes cover catastrophic failure. got started actually pretty reasonable, even optimistic prediction make. There's going goddamn movies made effort someday. 

Speaking timing imagine miserable working home would hit 20 years ago? Dial modem tying phone line day could AIM coworkers. Sending Word Perfect documents review Netscape email. You‚Äôve ignored everything I‚Äôve said based assumptions UK contract, okay obvious law student. completely wrong this, you‚Äôve ignored 13.1(e).

Reflexively downvoting pretty thoughtful comments really petty, too. never heard this. understanding people get flu shot every year better immunity flu. looking origins virus more? seems like huge deal gets swept rug anytime someone brings fear ‚Äúxenophobia‚Äù. Regardless came want know prevent something similar future. Let guess one rich people taking. Yeah articles make sense me. NJ, literally anyone get vaccine somehow manage get spot. I‚Äôm 20 gotten entire family. also know several families kids age gotten vaccine.

It‚Äôs better give vaccine someone rather throw dose. mRNA tech going change word. common cold far thing past. Well, things I'm reading asked spot, sure blame.

&amp;#x200B;

But saw big number black people refused vaccine would go Black Stars ask ""hey, would willing vaccinated camera"" encourage black people get vaccinated, acceptable would say. ""Why 100 Percent Population Immunity Enough Stop Spread Covid-19"" I'm bit disappointed. past 5 days flatlined 7-day moving average vaccinations per day. Monday, steady increase 250K vaccinations per week (i.e., week 1 250K, week 2 500k, week 3 750k, on). We've hit sort limit expansion. dug numbers know whether production, regional distribution, end patient distribution issue - disappointing trend.

Fingers crossed blip. Delivery schedules accelerating. Exactly, comment ""simply false"" simply false...

I'd rather gamble. people seem fine ""meh, think so"" good enough them. 400m EU's contribution loan!  certified bullshit. It‚Äôs media.. modeling done reputable institutions predicting variants likely prolong update 10AM today actually Right, that's decade, we're within first year masks. first year new thing I'd expect kind resistance. Pump peehole J&amp;J 2 million doses available. going help Canada time soon. That's think too. mutating much think vaccines losing battle. think would better put efforts instant, reliable testing could requirement certain things. get tested want travel, certain establishments require negative test admittance. Bars, restaurants forth.

That vaccine would see us get rid covid decade so. yeah....I think we're going trying get rid covid 2030 still. Actually can, have. severity symptoms relies different things. One, strength immune system bodies ability fight infection. obvious needs explanation. Two, underlying health issues. People (even younger, healthier people) cardio/neuro/pulmonary conditions exacerbated disease, even one know about. Three, there's something called viral load. discussed minimally prior COVID-19, described amount viral particles person exposed to/enters body direct relationship severity disease. course, factors interact severity disease variable. 

There 4th one, nobody likes reason: bad luck. Diseases injuries fair. people get unlucky severe symptoms die things not. Probably Blue Kitties. Honestly meant return normal life, I‚Äôd get booster every year along fly shot. Since value dollars lives

Countries value lives dollars tend citizens shitty lives. That's always case anti vaxxers. I‚Äôm probably going hell saying yes deaths matter that‚Äôs true causes death, too. Covid. seems like super small number paying attention I‚Äôd curious many population also treat bodies like shit poor diet lifestyle. bugs cases general population altered life health vulnerable they‚Äôve actively done ‚Äúadjustment period‚Äù *adapt* very, rough. 66% efficacy complete flop moron. Anything 90 you'da touted right im wrong.

Go suck egg. safe family! ‚ò∫Ô∏è Wishing well! I'm tired this, ""the side worse"" argument. Even true right currently worse basically like choose drinking antifreeze drinking cyanide. Sure, cyanide lot worse, give water instead? life I'd like able leave voting booth without feeling dirty choose one terrible politician instead even worse one.

Neither side gives one shit science unless science supports political goals. telling redditors become selfless altruists March last year? they've scared safety whole time? Yes lot nurses people working nursing homes passing vaccine. That‚Äôs population need get first don‚Äôt pass people caring for. 

Frustrating don‚Äôt enough vaccine right promoting vaccine black community absolutely vital.  Occupancy based fire codes, often outnumber realistic capacity greatly restaurants way inaccurate false negatives. accurate give positive. Sorry bud. Faulting Australia New Zealand?  joke. Whoops, looks like JJ's single dose turned complete flop. ""All confirmed"" say go return facebook news sources. We're goong able eradicate it. We've able eradicate 2 diseases successfully. able control virus vaccines atleast say weatern countries enough vaccines. Korean government content keeping daily case numbers 400s? seem really noncommital enacting measures bring down. probably-Bolsonaro-supoorting OP meant ""lockdowns lead unemployment, unemployment leads poverty, poverty leads desperation, desperation leads death"", think. I‚Äôve heard too. think is? Like gain now? Maybe link everytime see people dooming city college subreddits. God bless soul Okay still get covid vaccine, won‚Äôt die. won‚Äôt moderate symptoms....

I‚Äôm guessing still spread then... Soo it‚Äôs gonna help problem...but solve problem...basically tour gonna get it? combined efficacy AZ jab across late stage trials 70%, marginally better J&amp;J jab. also suggested number experts AZ efficacy SA Variant may cut 50%, find whether case next week. would render jab practically useless. 

The AZ jab would still help places rampant community transmission. vastly slow case levels. place zero cases, could fling open borders using jab? 

Right go mass sporting events music festivals mask zero virus. one going accept getting jab go back social distancing borders open. dunno man. got flu 3 times last year nothing year. Shit seems good. friend works J&amp;J tells vaccine trials fucking disaster disorganized hot mess. wouldn‚Äôt get J&amp;J vaccine. honestly hope high school kids get first, first ones allowed go back Two, actually (Luiz Henrique Mandetta Nelson Teich). current one (General Eduardo Pazuello) basically ""yes man"". There‚Äôs plenty non wealthy people mindset different circumstances, way. Sure, life may effected exact way I‚Äôm sure relationships changed among things, well. Change relative hits everyone differently variety reasons. I‚Äôve read plenty dooms day stories people grateful employed all, they‚Äôre stoked get unemployment finally blame failure life something outside control. saying, isn‚Äôt rich vs poor thing. It‚Äôs victim vs accountable mindset thing. mean pandemic end year will. may need periodic booster shots kind like flu almost although probably every year since still seem mutate much influenza does. Teachers start signing vaccine February, keeping mind anyone 65+ supply limited. Schools go 100% online February 15th. Probably get first dose. [Contract came turned EU bag liars. Incompetent liars. AZ UK completely right.

Instead defending screwing vaccination procurement manufacturing, wild attacks anyone mother, including company provides vaccines **at cost**, EU approved yet...

demonstrate EU see inept liars caused thrown away positions power. One could hope. two countries major trading partners? Border restrictions hurt economies greatly. Cool bro~ I‚Äôm pretty healthy dude 30s. I‚Äôve taking Covid seriously way shifted actions ordered life.  actions behalf loved ones good community workplace.  suspect get Covid I‚Äôll fine. 

But lately biggest thought personal health beyond random clotting issues get Covid don‚Äôt want lose taste smell long time possibly permanently (rare know, guy went college hasn‚Äôt normal area since March without clue sort out).  

Do know vaccines would keep happening? would think ones cranking 94% protection would way likely clocking 70% lessen chances that.  Yet could still tout would keep hospital would avoid ‚Äúserious‚Äù illness.  

Thoughts? Welcome West, Japan. IF. WHOLE WORLD. STAYED HOME TWO WEEKS. Glad see love privileged. one? say pneumonia DVT part mild COVID. It‚Äôs great significantly decrease hospitalizations sounds like may still vulnerable permanent/long term lung scarring heart damage problems.  Again, 52% includes first two weeks vaccine virtually effect. says quote - difference day 12. third week 89% efficacy. 

Obviously data wide confidence intervals many infections one week. data long immunity one dose would last everyone got second dose 3 weeks. 52% meaningless figure vaccine expected work moment injected.

Novavax, JnJ Moderna/Pfizer use three different types technology (Moderna Pfizer similar) draw conclusions drop efficacy one assume proportionally others wrong. also can't say specific antibody treatment serum recovered person's displayed x fold reduction neutralisation vaccine must also drop efficacy proportion. Maybe we'll taken giant meteorite then. ultimate conclusion critical cover many people 1 shot can.

You get one shot, miss chance blow anyone give reasonable explanation can't start vaccinating kids sooner 6 months? They're probably ones spreading it.. germ-sponges. Elon Musk made deal Galactic Federation even sure Novavax could considered late party. pulled ahead J&amp;J AZ while. People (more importantly media) little confidence Novavax they're small firm never successfully got past FDA trials vaccine targeted easy distribution developing countries using unsexy tried true vaccine tech. 

But yeah, huge surprise Novavax essentially best performing vaccine paper announcing right time, one expected happen. odds always heavily stacked them. Provided teachers vaccinated see issue see article. counting additional time teachers spend planning (adapting curriculum online formats HARD), grading, dealing bureaucratic stuff. Remote learning substantially adds time required that. may sound like you, even though direct teaching time may gone down, workload gone up. think teachers lazy time lives right now, woefully uninformed. Check r/teachers see venting 60+ hour work weeks (of 20 hours week unpaid) believe me. Teaching already hard, underpaid, typically thankless task pandemic, worse now. Teachers enemy here.

Source: SLP public middle school GSK/Sanofi Well fuck you! I'll fucking 80 year old then! political reasons, countries never even consider Sinovac (USA/UK/India). case, npr funded USA, surprise! care China/Russia's vaccines. Ending That‚Äôs thinking, too. Let‚Äôs say two better vaccines actually 80% chance preventing contagious infection. (This wild-ass guess part, assuming it‚Äôs 95% preventing disease.) probability vaccinated friend infectious exposure *and* getting exposure 0.2 x 0.05 = 1%. That‚Äôs whole lot better 100% would now. [66%] positive?

1.	A typical flu shot ‚âà60% efficacy (disclaimer: coronavirus influenza); shot well within acceptable range
2.	J&amp;J 85-89% effective severe symptoms multiple variants, including South Africa variant
3.	Medically, main goals minimizing hospitalizations deaths; fits bill.
4.	J&amp;J says make 1 billion doses year‚Äîthat‚Äôs 1 billion people immunized severe coronavirus episode
5.	This shot easier distribute.
6.	Some people may comfortable adenovirus vaccine mRNA vaccine. year in, happily take what‚Äôs available.

So meets normal standards, works extremely well really matters, helps us reach pressing goals, greatly accelerate global inoculation coronavirus. Overall, it‚Äôs good news. FUNDING I've found drinking gatorade (I buy G2 powder cuz cheap less sugar) helped some. one standard lines helping people mild POTS, seems bit common long covid. I'm suprized scroll far see joke like this. expected lol trick get people take it. Oh fuck off. You‚Äôll hiding away cave 2030 that‚Äôs really mentality. virus won‚Äôt 100% eradicated years years, ever. Take vaccine go life. You‚Äôll fine. Jesus Christ. don‚Äôt get much prepayment doses, massive ramp supposed happen pre-approval, seemingly never happened.

Here US alone fall promised former president 100m doses distributed end year.

We roughly 20m. rest, even it‚Äôs 50m, where‚Äôs 50m plus another 40m supposed manufacture 10m doses week. threw loop news came UK spotted variant sequencing whole time, whereas US flying blind year front. may several variants within US whole time much spread going here. big question dangerous variants &amp; evade existing treatment protocols &amp; vaccines. shit? Correct. J&amp;Js results 66% **moderate severe** cases counted case 3 symptoms more. comparison, Pfizer required one symptom. Moderna required two. time, J&amp;Js delayed trial means they're going newer variants. Aside though, define success far easier. vaccine? I'm AZ/Oxford trial date unblinding Yep. AZ completely irrelevant. Looks like someone might need refresher slippery slope fallacy: teachers HATE teaching remotely lot harder adapt curriculum, kids much less engaged work completion rates abysmal, bureaucratic paperwork skyrocketed. Teachers spend lot unpaid time planning grading begin with, remote teaching substantially added burden. Burn even higher normally profession. Trust me, teachers large CANNOT WAIT things go back normal likely want schools closed willy-nilly.

Source: SLP public middle school also subscribes r/teachers. Thank eloquently making exact arguments gone head lately. wait Moderna Pfizer vaccines stay hunkered then. I‚Äôve read enough r/covidlonghaulers appreciate significance risk joining enough sit everything longer. I'm trying put burden anywhere. I'm explaining rationally asess risks.

Pfizer also behind production due required upgrades Belgium facility. UK diligent specifically paid AZ set plant fill order locally. EU pay single penny facilitates - would export UK even finished vaccinating vulnerable?


Whereas vice versa case, UK pay Pfizer vaccines, partially paying EU production facilities. 

So EU demanding something UK taxpayer paid threatening block export something else UK taxpayer paid get it. Well sure. flu vaccines completely suck. That‚Äôs recently people even bothered taking them. Black seniors healthcare workers, suffered disproportionately pandemic, could protecting families felt safe enough take it. folks get vaccinated, tell family friends turned ok, time comes, family friends may ready get vaccine too. think actually perfect time start campaign. Yeah - true. think said they‚Äôve saying JJ, Sinovac. good news, given context.

Everything that‚Äôs come since morning reducing severe illness hospitalizations JJ come numbers. entire media army pushing angle opposed ‚Äúnear-perfect protection standard‚Äù narrative we‚Äôve heard last two months. 

Which fine, holy moly JJ pull... That‚Äôs good point don‚Äôt think different. wondered demographic breakdown fatalities US first wave overwhelmingly black hispanic? Teacher vaccinated today town. It‚Äôs coming! Literally everyone involved mad commission this. Even stepping back left big warning ""using powers"" side. Like, wtf smoking week? Can't even follow rules trigger it. can't unilaterally. There's process. 

Problem is, cats bag now. nuclear option, London basically ignoring dup calls even consider using now? going called every week politician another. ü§£üòÇü§£üòÇü§£üòÇü§£üòÇü§£üòÇü§£üòÇü§£üòÇü§£üòÇü§£üòÇü§£üòÇü§£üòÇü§£ It‚Äôs true.

The original sars infectious symptoms started show. Sarscov2 infectious symptoms show.

That‚Äôs sars 2 easier control. wasn‚Äôt lethality, fact spread happened post symptom onset. 2% Israeli population 2cond dose January 14th. doubt he's making observation date now. Currently 18.5% Israeli population 2cond dose. one lot people take them, think that‚Äôs ‚Äúcould‚Äù. Mobility partial factor Covid infection trends, dwarfed longer duration changes %immunity.

You're literally saying California reached herd immunity else increase cases without increase mobility. ""dwarfing"" immunity here. Increases came result increase mobility...just based serological information. 

It's not. based modeling using modeling techniques used 2009 H1N1.  defined herd immunity don‚Äôt like don‚Äôt use way. 

You're first person I've seen that's tried redefine herd immunity mean social distancing. find useful definition since explains USA cases dropping way understandable general public.

You mean mislead public thinking herd immunity somehow means social distancing? Sounds object.

Words meanings. 94% better 72%, 72% infinitely better 0%.

Let's assume population vaccinated vaccine magic beginning pandemic:

- virus'd theoretical limit 28% people infect (a bit quarter), whatever damages virus population, reduced 1/4

- 28% people distributed across 72% immune means virus harder time transmitting. R (contagion index) hardly higher 1, pre-existing immunity would 2-2.5. virus get people spread like wildfire. 

- far assumed 28% immune all. assume people partial immunity virus, notice viral load infected people probably smaller, infections less durable. much smaller subset would unvaccinated population, get (really) sick it, really mild disease.

- R plummets easily, hospitals never overwhelmed, deaths virus near zero. Efficacy 72% turned 100% herd immunity plus pre-existing immunity. People never quarantine months, really feel living pandemic. UK / Canada I'd end nato spending eastern Europe let Russia way Europe block exports vaccine. 

Watch Europe straighten right up.  try two dose regimen phase 1? decided go 1 dose? yes amazing federal government run someone remotely competent :) statement made yesterday 1.6 millions fully vaccinated persons Israel. 17.5% Israeli population. 10.5% total Israeli population 2 shots+week yesterday, thus fully protected.

Moreover, Israel vaccinated vulnerable population first, 17.5% includes 73% 90+, 71% 80-90, 78% 70-80 60% 60-70. containing 7% 20-30, 10% 30-40.

As know hospitalization extremely skews elderly. 

In conclusion, depends referred vaccinated + week, vaccinated could got yesterday. Worse, vaccinated + week may hospitalized contracting COVID second dose, second dose full week max protection.

It's bit early. Yeah also said EU last year look now.. suddenly ""production"" problems countries get shots inflated prices. Worse Trump?  Downvoted right. moderate severe case prevention, prevented death. sucked South Africa trial.

Regardless, armchair scientists reddit insist J&amp;J trash, fact matter need capabilities possible play prevent hospitalization lower death rates COVID. fact single shot 66% effectiveness great theory vaccinate double amount people country, vs. Moderna Pfizer require booster waiting period.

Also, people overlook flu vaccine every year widely varying effectiveness rates different strains flu, people still get anyway. Sometimes low 25% variants.

I'd still push Pfizer Moderna get it, 66% still tremendous number single shot mass distributed quick manner. republican. spent last 40 years desperately trying get rid social security. mind elderly 'takers' die. advocate herd immunity. Fully aware would mean losing half population 65. isn‚Äôt individuals it‚Äôs herd. People thinking special got hole. Yes prioritize high risk individuals get 95% efficacy vaccine. Outside #1 priority get many vaccines arms quickly possible. better 75% efficacy everyone else 95% everyone‚Äôs still waiting. I'm seeing people speaking excitedly figures coming Israel, I'm sure I'm missing something.

Something folks who've 2 vaccine doses make ""only"" 2% people hospitals.

I'm imagining odds exposure, I'd expected even one dose would reduce serious cases marginal figures. Like, it'd one thing say percentage ""new infections"" people who'd vaccinated, I'd expect tiny fraction people get anything beyond mild symptoms. yet portion large needed hospitalized?

Was like, misleading headline, something control groups I'm missing here?  pandemic would lead trade war UK EU.

Remember big mess fishing December ? UK EU¬†anymore they'll tons big mess. 

Honesty, watching mess EU UK glad ordered vaccine collectively *the EU* Yes could done better member states government (well easier say do). imagine instead EU vs UK 27¬†countries *Battle royale* get vaccine. time crisis waste ressources fight others Except UK doesn‚Äôt vaccine export ban. Pfizer Moderna efficacy also drops new variants. 95% numbers misleading. sure hope it‚Äôs choice it‚Äôs going shot show people selfishly waiting Pfizer/moderna fucking rest society. sad theme throughout pandemic vaccinating essential workers first. large part chaos vaccination drive West stems mixed priorities large numbers old people filling vaccine queue still limited supply. friend Cali got first dose got informed unclear second made available him. seniors camped blankets parking lots awaiting vaccines Florida.

Getting vaccines much larger population slice like seniors requires solved supply constraints first, case countries/states.  Well widespread examples cases going without masks like Florida, Sweden, South Dakota, Egypt, etc. realize everyone thinks way fucked rest year least right? people take produce like they‚Äôve indicated could finished summer. Head Florida vote blue like NY. It‚Äôll run like NY time. wonder book ticket american airport book american airport said banned destination. time EU we‚Äôre issues vax quantity companies...

What coincidence. borrow 140% though. EU block export. want track what's exported. hope receive loads doses soon though. think depends elected normal politicians ones believe half government run cannibals Yup hope don‚Äôt try keep teirs roll out. imagine lot people see headlines say they‚Äôre gonna wait. needs get people‚Äôs arms ASAP despite people thinking they‚Äôre special deserve ‚Äúbetter‚Äù one... Woah hold on, thought learned lesson?? people pulling shit ass vaccine effectiveness idea percentages correlate immune response fun zero seconds. people trying make comparisons Pfizer/Moderna J&amp;J account completely different technologies. assuming ""the people infected them"" know responsible. reality is, asymptomatic presymptomatic, likely even know reason someone got sick died. know Novavax apply authorization EU/US? doubt parent thinks pandemic &amp; comes coming immediate future deciding kids.  flu leave young people life altering, debilitating damage like covid young people. vaccines prevented long haul side effects covid, I'd in, career physical I'm going get less effective vaccine thrust back normalcy. Yes would cost cool 6 million lives America alone. yeah would move lives, others would move *from* life. hey could never happen *you* right gives shit üòé  That's really good. wife long covid, still sure fully recovered 10 months. think ton people refuse get vaccine unfortunately. hence metric ""for whoever wants it"" Speaking Wisconsin:

No. I'm sure california find way botch it. Listen. Call crazy. trust vaccines science real. fuckin trust Johnson &amp; Johnson. I'm getting vaccinated next week fortunately something even think about. J&amp;J info coming out.... would I, anyone else, want vaccine comparison Moderna Pfizer? Oh god clear  AFAIK, Biontech similar effectivity strains. Correct wrong.

That‚Äôs America first politics. hes politician scientist. understand science chosen present reading data best suits political agenda. fact incorrect really matter him. exactly it. people get infected house visiting friends family. mean everywhere else wear masks. chance infection low day. There's boatload assumptions long-COVID sub one even medical professional's diagnosis leople want take it, that's problem. do, lower odds transmission. perfect treated like - indoor gatherings like OP's case risky even masks. huge majority 'long-COVID' PTSD. one say though victim-blaming ""how dare question severe illness?""

It's amazing far we've come posts like ones actually getting upvotes. 6 months ago said probably get banned sub. Well things already stepping up. highest amount daily vaccinations past two days. things Im cautiously optimistic long high enough supply well everything organized time. So? change fact overkill situations. understand Spain wear masks basically anywhere home?

The problem lack good enough masks, Christmas New Years. Ban meetings private shit goes away quickly. 2069 US tried spring 2020 shut racist personally liked satire article said market MLM business women bOsS bAbEs get tons women board anti right away No, know sure. initial studies look pretty good, necessarily lab studies stage, actual field studies take months complete keep cool head now. variants interest discovered week now, massive sequencing program across globe, always take check lowers efficacy. good scientists able revise vaccines new booster shots. However, bad concerned lay person: worried variants confirmed researched, constant state panic next 6 months, maybe even permanently. placebos vaccines diseases. ever renter society great time start fucking trial. 
No consequences? Buckle way worse.  
Consequences? still probably buckle case I‚Äôve helping lot elderly get scheduled Ohio. I‚Äôve scheduled people 6-7 different locations. one tells shot getting there. it‚Äôs pretty easy figure scheduled come back 28 21 days shot got. scheduling mom Monday doesn‚Äôt want Modera heard side effects worse I‚Äôll try places know scheduling second shot 21 days later. Crazy. doctors said heart nerve damage?  guess sleeping rock past year. agree. Good luck convincing others though. Pfizer tested new strains circulated. apples oranges comparison. EU. US. export ban. Says you, science. could probably would dump people Covid ocean Covid numbers 

""They die Covid! drown"" need since many countries fully vaccinated end year. mostly 95+ vaccines almost eradicate virus. reddit. Brits blame everything EU.  give vaccine old people better vaccines young. Old people ones worry dying, long folks issue chronic disease long covid, heart issues etc. . targeted approach. Old people don‚Äôt ton time worry long term damage. far seems less 1% experience high fevers doses. that's good news front.  


I would also consider fact getting early stages pregnancy vs mid-late risk developmental fetus. much happens first trimester, anything could effect likely then.  


So mom lower risk catch it, would probably look going later shot well fact know. Though high-risk position, risk point too. 


There women given birth obvious issues babe mom getting vaccine late pregnancy - Hoping hear good news baby got protection. 

Here hoping brighter answers!  know politician reliable source information. Nope. EU ""take"" vaccines anyone. order vaccines companies, pay companies legally bound fulfill orders.

If company agreed fulfill order EU vaccines produced UK vaccines produced EU enough, exactly do. don't, EU problem company, UK.  


EU problem UK UK says company fulfill order EU.   EU start let people know anything EU based would go EU, countries like Canada Australia could made plans. Putting export bans last moment screws completely. think theory healthcare provider would coordinate booster shot specific vaccine company first two shots received. know practical practice, think makes sense. 27 year old man back line here. literally give first vaccine can. dont give fuck is. want life back. want it, get hell way. US, contact public health department. logistical reasons can‚Äôt set second dose soon, I‚Äôd trust least advise five minutes J&amp;J dose‚Äôs safety someone like you. Pretty sure remote ended TV heard Zeke Emanuel say MSNBC. Thankful proven wrong. really feel like would better prioritizing getting many people first shot giving second.it would make logistics adminstaring much easier would likely keep vast vast majority recepients hospital really worried right dumb. keep seeing level thinking absolutely hate it. know good 66 percent one-dose vaccine ANYTHING is?! seasonal flu shot comes every year 40-50 percent efficacy rate, dont see people screaming two shots trying chug butts. take first one offered move life. J&amp;J turns Covid inconvenient cold 2 days, earth would it? Novavax finished trial. apply emergency authorization couple months. J&amp;J applying next week. gonna wait better one since want take lower chance appease shareholders. Pfizer Moderna better bet even needing booster better odds variants circulating That's great you, stopped working 60 hour person weeks throughout pandemic. Currently dealing daughters 3rd daycare closure.

I'd like available vaccine. I'll take first available, first open slot. Novavax vaccine trial South Africa still serious cases vaccinated group despite lowered efficacy totally blocking infection 

This good news. Even 50-60% efficacy B.1.351 variant high enough move us toward manageable levels/normalcy. thats then? state good job vaccine distribution one didn‚Äôt sign Walgreens/CVS contract. West Virginia believe 2 weeks always presented closing things hospitals could keep up. never presented ""close 2 weeks keep closing long covid exists."" exactly used it... use lower rate, population needed make difference increases. I'm giving minimum population size needed. Lowering rate increases population size needed. mean, I‚Äôd feel guilty either way everyone responsible agree see someone get sick you‚Äôre equally responsible. wouldn‚Äôt put anyone risk parties fault it‚Äôs like people getting sick didn‚Äôt know risk make choice themselves. isn‚Äôt always case time there‚Äôs acknowledgment risk whoever gets sick you‚Äôve gotta take responsibility life point Yup, looking forward part province's proud 30% get 2022. Thank you! applied accepted study! add others saying, Moderna Pfizer likely less 95% effective current strains active now. tested coronavirus mutated. hand, J&amp;J vaccine tested vaccine-resistant South Africa strain already spread. real headline 100% effective stopping hospitalizations deaths. That's part fixes world. Knowing luck, state federal governments would probably find way screw pray stop going gender reveal parties Imagine dying covid waiting non J&amp;J vaccine lol jumping vaccine get offered since prevent hospitalizations importantly stops harmful effects virus

And asked around people sick Covid 19 ... 60 percent effective, especially randomly walk past someone virus something Worst education country highest levels Covid country. population must failed biology class, think smarter medical doctors. 14 days first Pfizer least like 89-90% depends tortured logic is. Logically speaking, plan would mean action one vaccinated. plan push responsibility onto states. plan avoid work responsibility. good leadership, claim plan spin. hear ya. Jab JJ vaccine today!! think confidence interval deaths pretty low. suspect enough deaths make much this. Hopefully low hospitalizations translates similar death statistic (so say 90 95% death). yet see anything suggest still huge problem J&amp;J vaccine little resolve.

Can link evidence huge problem? Source? I've seen articles stating EU wants transparency make sure get vaccines ordered UK hoard vaccines already ordered EU would want shitty vaccine 65% efficacy vs 95% Pfizer Modern? mean upper midwest? Upper northwest would Oregon Washington state California's wave cycle experienced pattern California significant spike. Upper midwest states (ND, SD, Wisconsin, Michigan, etc) ~1 month ahead California upper northwest states brought cases significantly well holidays leading much smaller surge simply less seed cases. first point little limit 28% population damage virus would reduced almost 3/4 1/4 That‚Äôs great. course Netherlands, 2022 vaccinated. FFS, minister accountable this, proud around 200.000 ppl vaccinated total since vaccine (Jan 6).

We vaccines totally block severe infection population that's end it. Back normal treating like weird strain flu. opposite. provides greater seal loose fitting cloth mask plus loose fitting surgical mask magically combine thickness makes better fit. Crazy know. Two pieces fabric becoming thicker combine them. Beyond belief. Anyway. three weeks. Breathability fine it‚Äôs strangely comfortable.  Well no, top half states new cases per capita, better states stricter rules, true. No. never 1 shot. think early data suggested offers protection one shot, potentially could pass one shot vaccine. remember time people saying pfizer 2 shots 1. policy/legal question executive order quarantining arriving US. currently slated coming back trip end Feb, week later plan move help moving company new location end month. violate quarantine protocols? options legal ramifications? History full nations uniting around use scapegoat. Nothing surprising all. Remember, we‚Äôre going seeing indisputable effects climate change next decades even people going say it‚Äôs actually Democrats weather manipulation devices. Synthesizing climate change for... reasons.

 point people master justifiers. never reflect Trumps plan Jared sell vaccines return Jared would let trump smell fingers, that‚Äôs there‚Äôs million vaccines missing national reserve.  Novavax

Even South African strain weaker completely blocking still completely prevented severe cases  Imagine thinking imprison people 80 year olds die diseases. here

I've saying ever since idea full protection without sterilizing immunity brought might end lowering CFR less jack shit that's ends pandemic 

I care catch every damn strain planet every year long vaccine reduces sniffles It‚Äôs 5 shots now? That‚Äôs great news! like 8 10 kid got bit stray dog couldn‚Äôt catch, ‚Äò88. stomach too! Thank goodness modern medicine! Freaking love vaccines! law creates huge enduring viral reservoir extends pandemic. one point local hospitals turning ambulances away take them. assuming want taking vaccines testing change results That's great news assuming local, state, federal gov'ts screw pooch. . really seem common anymore, I'm honest. Oops, meant hundreds thousands. really remember public sentiment time, remember personally absolutely certain classes would online least summer, think everyone around felt way. recall ever believing ""just two weeks"". get vaccinated could travel Europe things back normal mid summer.  fucking disgrace. judges touch society it‚Äôs unbelievable. poor woman fingers may crossed, I‚Äôm holding breath. Know mean? really isn‚Äôt hard. Ive wearing surgical mask cloth mask past three weeks. Much better deal cloth mask it‚Äôs strangely comfortable breathability absolutely fine. get spare anti-virus cancel viruses mini-explosions. Hundreds millions?

Lowest day since november 23rd. will, evolution works. lmao Australia New Zealand high quality life, low deaths, unemployment never got bad US' Brazil's, governments high approval rating handling pandemic. idea talking about. lot people disagree say established he's wrong though. Germany also using AZ 65+ Although spike nearly large high number cases would indicate. think better treatment way testing, severe cases detected. Fair enough, way things going largely dictated apathetic federal government literally plan distribution procuring doses. current administration least competent enough get things rolling, production stopped.  


I'm hopeful we'll see big turnaround distribution handled March. Maybe slow virus spread variant opportunity opening everything back enough people vaccinated. Call crazy. tide get one mRNA vaccines, then. Also, seems even variants vaccines lower sterilizing effect still vulnerable weakened 

In Novavax vaccine trial South Africa still serious cases vaccinated group despite lowered efficacy totally blocking infection

So may end getting shot-up passing around sniffles population build-ups immunity exposure longer dangerous F covid think comments little unclear I'm trying let guy hook. I'm trying put state Texas hook this. They've refused consistent messaging particularly interested discouraging foolishness comes virus. ignorant 100% decent statewide leadership(and Nationwide) maybe people like could gotten sense stuff like happens.  lol. barely 50%.

now know actual fools Dumb people voting you. individual infection opportunity virus become something else. means vaccines need get many people possible around globe. can‚Äôt see achieving heard immunity USA alone viable strategy given possibilities line virus pursues it‚Äôs purpose replicate efficiently possible. don‚Äôt think FDA going approve vaccine emergency use. meet threshold set minimum efficacy. doesn‚Äôt sound sympathetic.

And believed UK even recieve 4m AZ vaccines produced EU widely rumoured.  plenty doses? Although vaccinating much? so? used AZ yet proven affected 65+ year olds? Someone defending far right predident acusing people internet fake news using ""whatabaoutism""? Wow, unexpected.... live Alabama 1/3 sounds right here, may even more. know county live 10 percent reported infections weeks 30 40 percent positive rates I'd believe 4x. anecdotally feels like almost half people know it. Publix administer shots first ok idea he‚Äôs since started, we‚Äôll see actually gets executed competently definitely first time I‚Äôve hopeful Yea see that. much outdoor mandates even help? studies one ""diminishing returns"" mandates even mythical 95% compliance? Weird considering said (Bloomberg seems day behind). *think* that‚Äôs point OP trying make though - vaccine reduces severity virus contract it. 

I agree though I‚Äôd rather closer 99% catch all. Really hoping I‚Äôll able get Moderna Pfizer shot, least let us decide want shot less effective. Yeah raise point. COVID vaccines 3 4 weeks though, correct comment bit. think mostly talk. type people originally saying ""I'm going wait see long term effects"" suddenly changed tune. demand greatly outnumbers supply people going take get offered.

Even though preferences, nurse tells get 1-shot vaccine now, wait couple months schedule 2-shot vaccine, going tough decision me. weird people grab onto negativity like thing keeping afloat.  think you‚Äôre something. well resourced,private, charter public schools figured keep everyone safe building. kid‚Äôs school done phenomenal job. Ventilation, distancing, tracing, masks. remote teaching top notch. Parents cooperate. like magic works. 

But half teachers won‚Äôt teach you‚Äôre public school stick 30 room rather 15 lack staffing room, ventilation nonexistent, you‚Äôre screwed. kid screwed doesn‚Äôt get needs, disease safe action remote teaching quality mixed. class learning teachers get sick. people send kid school sick lack options, whole tracing thing breaks down. 

You could probably get working it‚Äôs going fair everyone. need destination kids single parents sick. need get scared teachers teach better remotely, keep class sizes small teachers willing teach person limit person ones need most. probably need add tutoring remote kids. parents upset. Even send vaccines they're blocking end summer, still result huge delay. understand that? capable understanding that?..

They send us vaccines world + pony us 5 years now, late. People dying here.

Do understand?.. passing Voight-Kampff test. J&amp;J vaccine still 85% effective stopping severe illness It‚Äôs also easier administer distribute Moderna Pfizer. There‚Äôs negative slant take here, it‚Äôs great vaccine reach lot people needs one dose easier store always seem day behind. least state reporting.

I live Georgia Bloomberg's total's state always previous day. spend much time reading COVID, say certainty zero-COVID generally used :)

Zero COVID acknowledges eradication (like done smallpox) impossible, least now, propose local elimination. I.e. exactly NZ did: bring zero locally (within national borders) NPIs (well, vaccines also, course suffice arent's 100% effective), seal borders lockdown locally community spread emerges (which occasionally, reason mentioned). Even widespread vaccines borders stay closed, opened countries achieved zero COVID, on.

This basically recipe. Please - don‚Äôt start told wear mask thing. people still using excuse people wouldn‚Äôt wear masks regardless anyone said point. people can‚Äôt evolve beliefs new evidence that‚Äôs them.

I‚Äôm disputing extremely difficult telling people stay houses distance (as said hasn‚Äôt stopped many people beginning anyway). doesn‚Äôt make right prudent thing, however. Alright, well hope right E484 mutation shown affect people differently. Meaning may able neutralize others not. That‚Äôs South African variant (that ties Brazilian variant well) efficacy vaccines right 50-60%. good long dominant strain old/UK. SA/BR strain becomes dominant, need different vaccine affected it. highlights important issue controlling highly dangerous virus allowed mutate even even worse monster. 

Further, thread, highlighted best case scenario right continue let virus go. Best case aged 65+ 240k+ deaths year consistent high efficiency vaccines, 80% vaccinated, preventative measures, etc. mention lower efficacy vaccines, measures above, 400k+ year dying. damn well hope right peddling anti-scientific sentiment personal agenda. Thanks. Thank posting text. extremely low risk illness death beginning. 0.02% fatalities age 0-14 chance dying get virus literally one million age group. Bummer. not? good take. public health crisis caused covid there, instead severe covid cases putting huge load healthcare.

Herd immunity secondary end pandemic. Normal life start begin COVID still exists, long causing massive numbers severe disease cases.   see real is- oh fucking wow. HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH anyone pushing denial fucking criminal. Getting little late this, fellas 66% effective mild illness, 85% severe illness, 100% effective death. think people care last two. shows UK US it, it‚Äôs fine. EU if, it‚Äôs bad. 

The EU actually ONE EXPORTS vaccines. US UK exporting anything. Interesting evolving direction away vaccines even population. bad luck? selection pressure vaccines actually starts bite, happen? feel bad long COVID sufferers, considering many people thread getting voted saying head. 

I know previously healthy people can't walk flight stairs without stopping breathe top sure, head üôÑ get 8x less effective? equally effective severe illness death. Yep agreed. Obesity qualifying condition too, could make argument there. Bottom line keeping hospitals freed up, vaccinate en masse distribution capacity allows. Yeah, let personally shut US borders. I'll get right that. Hmmm...Interesting Say two groups 10,000 people give one group vaccine group fake shot i.e. placebo. release wild track them.

Months later look got sick much group. 100 deaths placebo group 5 vaccine group say 95% effective preventing death. 100 mild illnesses placebo group 34 vaccine group say 66% effective preventing mild illness etc. Love post right says exact opposite  Sorry no. vaccines go countries helped fund produce them
First. largely responsible ignored disease first Well, everyone else better trying could hard do. Yeah stupid clickbait, policy. neither. thought Michigan heartland, know? Sturdy hardworking loyal neighborly Americans, like northern New England.

Turns there's bunch crazy people there. Turns four five states country asylums criminally insane. Zero Covid means stay lockdown **few months longer**

""Just months"" LMAO every time. know country largest ice cream consumption percapita Switzerland?

It absolutely nothing weather. Yeah know vaccinate 50M 178M people 100M doses April. Still leaving 62M phase 2. 

Yet lying us medical grade supplies won‚Äôt work? seriously hope someone else takes CDC coming years removes idiots partially blame health crisis they‚Äôve shown balls downplayed severity situation. 

US Jan 3rd 370k confirmed dead 420k excess deaths. get kicked thee teeth new variants nearly bad think. joke NJ. Total free all. State registration. County registration. Registration separately local hospitals nonprofits. appointments available. know, garbage science, anecdotes, fear-mongering. stumbling immunization campaign

My god I'm tired this. Virtually every country world besides US jealous progress US making, US, call failure.

Let give quick call clue phone: US vaccination program actually going pretty well. Exactly! antibiotica resistent germs aswell also caused extreme hygiene behavior. I'm 'racist' 'bigot ' 'selfish' saying though. Hospital friend works doesn‚Äôt expect mandate vaccines least 3 years. Wouldn‚Äôt expect vaccine mandate general public One new strain exploded UK first, one South Africa, one Brazil.

It would wise roll vaccines according capability low infection numbers.

Unfortunately, financial organizational capability translate well real world numbers. Switzerland made mess it, Vietnam aced it. No, obvious online KSA operative funny me. Bonus points sending Twitter link source ""claim."" Probably shipping Isreal since pay ass moment.  Yep exactly. first every headline 66% efficacy. actually read press release... realized way better that.

Writer: ""The J&amp;J vaccine results out!""

Editor: ""Too bad vaccine sucks!""

Writer: ""Have read it? provides 100% protection deaths and...""

Editor: ""I'm telling sucks! Everyone's hopes high crush them! Find bad news there!""

Writer: ""Well, take average efficacy, including time shot, include mild illnesses, get efficacy 66%.""

Editor: ""Perfect! Run that!"" hearing can‚Äôt choose vaccine get supplies mRNA vaccines limited difficulty production. also hearing mention waiting well. It‚Äôs confusing. wish right seriously doubting it. There‚Äôs exemptions majority school vaccinations easy get Well, guess good learning experience many. Wont stop bluechecks hollywood stars though. I'm seriously thinking never, ever let covid go. Lol don‚Äôt need kids vaccinated go back normal. Literally nobody suggesting that. flu much deadlier kids covid Stop saying start shitting vaccines. wonder one could get J&amp;J vaccine line supply less issue also get mRNA vaccine. It‚Äôll never ‚Äúover‚Äù completely lol it‚Äôs contagious respiratory virus it‚Äôll around forever. vaccine available everyone restrictions need end purchasing vaccines bad thing? mean Colonel Sanders could issues anytime last year wanted??? CDC always power!?!?!

""Ain't B"" - Rick James emotional basis things

You‚Äôre editorializing. People always overlook reverse vampire zombies. know keep getting radar. Absolutely. Nobody focuses common sense things like washing hands super cautious risk. Instead put cheap mask pretend like they're invincible saving world. Yeah constant shit ""articles"" like going make people snap eventually  tears. ain‚Äôt happening. 178M people classified 1B-1C. would need 89M people vaccinated 178M doses March 1 make happen.

Biden team ramped 10M week. Meaning won‚Äôt get 100M Jabs (or 50 million vaccinated) basically April. Majority us going Spring government sits hands...

And still leaves Phase 2 includes 62M people.  Yep exactly. Fauci says vaccine amazing, incredible, way better expected, says take it, still lock down, wear mask, socially distance, can't travel, can't hug shake hands.

This going result lot people either a) taking vaccine b) stop listening Fauci. sure hope so. masks would make feel normal definitely help mental health issues Exactly  ‚Äúbeauty‚Äù Pfizer-BioNTech Moderna vaccines, according Dr. Onyema Ogbuagu, led Pfizer trial Yale Center Clinical Investigation, tweaked target new variants arise. It‚Äôs matter replacing one bit protein another, said. say ‚Äú85% effective severe symptoms, 77% effective US, that‚Äôs confusing.  85% 77%?

If took strategy letting run free, hospitals would buckle load. Unfortunately initial response awful many people told masks work. put brains beliefs never change. 

Once general population able get vaccinated hospitalisations cases start going extremely difficult telling people stay houses distance. That's fact backwards. locking getting rid virus right away allowed mutate. send north? Every vaccine maker giving us shaft Well, let's speculate. vaccinate +55 yo world population, virus evolve toward infecting kids. hundreds worst scenarios. saying first time reacting fast virus currently infecting millions week, creating millions variants every 3 days, know right strategy long run. 80 years old? survive virus. deadly. ""The panel, deliver final report March, warned adversaries using artificial intelligence identify genetic weaknesses population engineering pathogens exploit them, genetic research designed enhance soldiers‚Äô mental physical strength."" Yeah, talking first doses. situation Belgium vaccination 0.1%.

We're probably 2-3 months behind US/UK, fine grand scheme things, still annoying. 6 month consequences recovering Covid.

Fatigue, muscle weakness, sleep difficulties anxiety commonly reported symptoms.

Maybe PTSD emotional basis things. recovering people probably went back lockdown. Fine line physical psychological. Another key finding extensive person-to-person variation mutations affect serum antibody binding neutralization. instance, neutralizing activity several samples reduced single mutations site E484, samples essentially unaffected E484 mutations. Similarly, mutations sites 443‚Äì450 loop (e.g., G446V) caused large drop serum antibody binding neutralization samples, little effect on-others. inter-individual heterogeneity compounded fact effects mutations sometimes changed time samples longitudinally collected individual. temporal changes could due disproportionate decay one dominant antibody clonotype,or relative increase antibodies targeting epitopes. vaccine efficacy place this. need figure differences occurring highly effective new vaccines next year. Otherwise worse mutations virus could mutate too. 65% significantly easier dose distribute 95%, that's trade worth taking Would shorter told - look Melbourne, *especially* considering went soft start.

Right now(and usually) money matter all. EU must get vaccine soon possible open economy prevent disaster. Target 60-70% Q2.

God, hope right. saying two pipelines separate, are. say UK AZ contract (involving fulfillment entire order UK plants) ignored, quite opposite. EU enough money afford vaccine world. quite, like 3 day delay UK included despite UK already pretty high Covid numbers think people mostly remember outrage 3 days. wanna take AstraZeneca, honestly cost Pfizer vaccine insignificant compared cost lockdown Western European countries. Maybe Eastern European countries so. true Germany first actually block order paid literally process shipped Italy right back start rbe pandemic spreading west. wash gloves too. well many reasons example hands small cuts weaknesses skin let infectants in. secondly wash hands wrong. third gloves moisture like skin thus virus dies faster them. also less likely touch face gloves phone tell wash phone? can't Around 80.2% protection, according Moderna study different time gaps, Oxford reported *superior* effectiveness 3 month delay doses. would get worry it. Every vaccine given 3-6 months apart, Covid got 3-4 week protocol world could wait vaccine takes months start trials. Meanwhile Europe : reeeee, deliveries slowing ! 

Meanwhile third world countries : vaccines ? vaccines ? clearly said need use places like New Zealand, Taiwan China guidlines actually fight virus. want one many weak minded continue classify important information serious concern virus mutations fear mongering can't handle reality go ahead surprised scientists warning us correct throughout pandemic.

EU commission fighting they're planning release contracts. blacked passages though. never see president go jail, mark words. would open door every single president arrested second opposite party got power. see EU using Pfizer/Moderna older age groups believe let 30-40 year olds get vaccines even enough doses available. Pretty sure force younger people take cheaper easier vaccines cut costs. expensive. go anyway except food go times nobody EU skip Pfizer prevent storing/delivery/administration costs

Can‚Äôt see happening, EU recently upped order 600m Germany ordering extra top that. vaccine probably best (similar Moderna), think EU using Pfizer vaccine hospitals mass vaccination centres conjunction using easier store vaccines community.

Basically know immunity lasts 90 days bare minimum. you‚Äôre safe then. Since vaccines limited, strategy saving resources may risk.  Nah, people lost family US took hard generally visible huge percentage population. huge number. Reminds hoping 50% effective vaccine We'd need nearly 5 million new people getting vaccinated day March 1 happen. Seems unlikely vaccination reallly slow though...
If would least vaccinate vulnarable people, doctors/nurses.
i want vaccine expect strong enough survive covid.

Politicians last i'd say.
Kings sound obsolete too. MIL anti-vax believer bit Jenny McCarthy it‚Äôs trendy anti-vax era remained skeptical.
When job said vaccinate don‚Äôt work got shot. Maybe one Great Filters. see overcome stupidity disinformation. That's case currently vaccines sizable chunk population those. Fucking antivaxers. / pretty big supply issues vaccines might eventually get quantity probably time initially stated. Uh oh automod left getting little heated one boss wait 90 days pretty strong reaction vaccine. Nothing dangerous, made feel pretty miserable.

Covid forever anti-vaxxers. :( herd immunity threshold, R=1 though. speed spread increases reduce coming herd immunity, cases drop due passed threshold. perfect protection everyone safe us everyone almost everyone vacinated yet somehow rich find way hoard it. Pathetic ) EU guess What‚Äôs science behind waiting 90 days?

Right boosters taken 3-4 weeks initial dose wouldn‚Äôt expect timeline similar? 65% pretty typical vacinnes also worth keeping mind virus environment worse testing environments Yea love analysis. still absurd levels cases. said hospitalizations matters looking better better want Moderna Pfizer though better delay 90 days vaccine doesn‚Äôt interfere natural immunity? Put cheese. Americans love cheese. EU invokes Article 16, introducing controls vaccine exports Northern Ireland [Irish News idea you‚Äôre talking about.

I‚Äôm 15 starting drive that‚Äôs risk accept. Covid adds risk, don‚Äôt want give skiing, hiking, biking, etc. possibly rest life. know it‚Äôs unlikely, adds risk. Plus, I‚Äôm well online school right now, quite less work normal (unless less work high school, really doubt). I‚Äôm Washington state lot fewer cases rest America school mostly outdoors, seems like would spread pretty easily cafeteria certain classrooms. saw plot total case rate time pfizer vaccine. says really obvious. infections vaccine group day 1 day 14. ignore total case counts look difference rate infections, dramatic. worst trend hear 'dropping cases' go back even though they're would record levels early December. ever growing peaks. unfortunate bit give conspiracy nuts way much work with. 20% point countries get cut, like UK. Germany, already appointed vaccinations get delayed several weeks. delivery cut might big fuck contracts EU part. Technically yes would still take virus mutate degree logistics extremely challenging plants spun simple setting t-shirt sweatshop I'm sure going use doses though. time USA mostly vaccinated, EU skip Pfizer prevent storing/delivery/administration costs use JNJ &amp; AZ instead. 

Maybe thinking China, India? also hard imagine. 16 317 5%. average hospitalisation rate infected without vaccine? sad 2725273th example public servers breaking rules.

In Spain 99% people wearing mask months. it? Fines. Sadly way. beginning last year government started gradually lax recommendations, like many people said, people would follow didn't.

Since strict lockdown police control introduced. would get fined walking dog far house, used drones fine people going beach even fine went supermarket buy one single thing. policy implemented masks made compulsory, everybody knows caught outside without mask fined, excuses. Even let someone inside shop without mask also get fined.

The bad thing people relax think one watching believe get infected family friends. lowest efficacy it? don‚Äôt care. expected take risk others? wait. clinical phase III.

It's tested real world sample size large enough guarantee 89% incredibly close real number. basic statistics. fact simple really need understand binomial distributions arrive 89% confidence interval goes along it. controlled trial real life vaccination Israel. near perfect result.

It difficult define control group case. possible it, longer well defined control group phase III trial. 92% number coming Israel right good sign, anything definitive.   Lol lash realize ridiculous comment France figured things out... huge spike month ago... ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è size Australia i.e approx 25 mil pop, never able self sufficient critical items globalized world.

They vaccines. locally producing AstraZeneca order. appointment June? That's insane, parents laws already gotten one dose due 65 ND, AZ, MN  spread continues new strains emerge vaccine/antibody evasion like South African strain 

For starters, yes may reasonable concern - honest solution *global* eradication absolutely possible. Even every wealthy country complete China style lockdown wore masks every day forever ever - poor countries would covid spread mutate would eventually reach wealthy countries again. Poor Asian, Latin American, African countries don‚Äôt working home, three layer masks, comfy protections here. **Eradication possible therefore cannot honest solution**. Covid going spread forever - deal like every virus started severe extremely tolerable layers immunity built naturally vaccines. 

In addition, various virologists said antibody production isn‚Äôt driver immunity. vaccine produced immunity can‚Äôt stop binding mutation stop killing hospitalizing me, that‚Äôs good enough. need vaccinate young get herd immunity even

I don‚Äôt think anyone saying that. They‚Äôre saying restrictions *slowly* walked back step risk hospital overcrowding. 

We vaccinate young - everyone 50 vaccinated risk indications change. 10,000 cases day 20 year olds isn‚Äôt risk hospital system. 10,000 cases day among 65 year olds is. They‚Äôre saying tolerate spread among young, therefore allow things like holiday gatherings maybe concerts clubs. dismiss long covid lung, organ damage 

Ok, Look. Yes, long covid ‚Äòlong term damage‚Äô arise covid infection.... saying ‚Äòthey happen‚Äô isn‚Äôt justification continue avoid levels socialization life hold dear. 

1) long term damage long covid *can* occur mild cases - get article rare. *More* rare current occurrence frequency long covid - pretty unlikely already (but yes still happens - know). take current rate long covid-er‚Äôs cut factor almost 7 .... even lower occurrence frequency. 

2) even rate long haulers mild severe symptoms ... don‚Äôt know cost-benefit analysis restrictions avoid longstanding cough fatigue small % population worth damage incurring remaining percentage population. March, sat said ‚Äòyes, ok incurring tons mental &amp; economic damage, Covid-19 killing people threatening hospital system, we‚Äôre ok it‚Äô. don‚Äôt know come conclusion negative outcome ‚Äòwe *some* people never really get covid can‚Äôt hike without getting tired anymore‚Äô. think decide get back living deal damaged people society. prolonging pandemic increasing risk risk community I‚Äôve wondering vaccine reduces transmission well infection. anyone know? article suggests true, reading correctly? going happen vaccinations finally get rid covid countries money access them, poorer countries continue ravaged continues spread mutate. Wont constant mutated forms virus eventually find way back places like US re-infect everyone? people vaccine got sick, 85% reduction expected number cases severe COVID (likely defined hospitalization/death). might change greater numbers, it‚Äôs pretty great hell lot better vaccine. Unsurprisingly J&amp;J appears less effective South African strain (as two vaccines). came Moderna/Pfizer-BioNTech, people would pretty pumped. it‚Äôs bit (additional) ethical question populations get vaccines greater efficacy. keep confirming this? Elementary school likely fine open, Junior High home. data we‚Äôve since last September, everyone wants go nothing. trend continues, stop trying. Biden went office. Wow amazing! Lol isn‚Äôt true people city. friends early mid 30‚Äôs still love going festivals, partying, etc. We‚Äôre like children (+maturity responsibility). thought NYC, true every city I‚Äôve lived in. always end meeting people age love live large limit age. mean ""reasonable solutions""? solutions are, clear those. 

Just facts inconvenient, mean they're true. 

Looking factors U.S. - botched vaccine rollouts, number new, highly contagious variants, number people seem likely simply refuse vaccine, number people still refuse wear masks socially distance, strong sense we're race almost chance winning point.  

If sense all, would implement strict nationwide lockdown - much enforcement necessary - next four months (along robust financial assistance businesses unemployed) get many people vaccinated possible. Would suck? course. Even I'm tired inside able much, high tolerance solitude. think likely facing absent kind move going far worse. we‚Äôre going vaccine passports now? Serious question. Screw jj im waiting pfizer moderna. JJ fucking baby powder gives cancer. best way make sure variant Fuck us continue staying fuck home endgame plays out. cannot stressed enough. 10% population dies would friends family 90%. ask bit went you? Go move lockdown state then. Don‚Äôt selfishly demand everyone else stay home continue go out. wait. work home groceries delivered. much rather wait get better vaccine. America bailed science sound like tend towards asocial. Nothing wrong it. long judge others needing socialization, judge you. problem healthcare workers likely exposed, therefore carry risk transmit. believe freedom choice unless job direct contact sick elderly people.

Also worth mentioning article 5 months old now, isn‚Äôt based actual statistics various vaccines rolling out. Well yes, now, asked got vaccine. didn‚Äôt say yes. US pregnant women get vaccine choose to.  seems like mostly developed countries ravaged covid though. Hopefully things stay many bad outbreaks poorer countries.

That said there's also initiatives get vaccines developing world already, may end much problem there's many vaccines available. still insinuating act vaccinating people somehow increases likelihood vaccine resistant strain last sentence. not. Totally agree way thinking needs aggressively pushed masses people like I... Someone said something similar last month got voted oblivion. media done great job scaring everyone, time start accepting fact coronavirus going disappear completely, evaluating personal risks vaccine, time start restoring normal way life. There's always going outlier cases children healthy people dying damn virus, hell - even adverse reactions vaccine - another thing world can't overthink worry hole over. children!

What *everyone* 

At least children many years left life recover isolation struggles. 25% hospital staff received dose?

Not trying Debbie Downer seems surprisingly high given vaccine 6 weeks. working home something? high percentage anti-vax? :/  I'm afraid ask, mean 25% people declined vaccine? go dude. end line logic shit dangerous. Misinformation dangerous. People die this. ‚ÄúThis could months lockdowns UBI‚Äù

Meanwhile, real world whatever absurd fantasyland you‚Äôre imagining... sportsball Ah, technically trial then. That's fine chose so. propaganda referring to? one really reply unless make argument case for/against something. Protip: hear teacher teacher advocate say parents 'want free daycare', tell they've effectively said training job teaching pointless abolished. computer programs parental supervision work *so* well, retire.

No, one people believe this. Yes, think teachers feel safe school. particular line needs die. mean ‚Äúprovide vaccines cost‚Äù?

It‚Äôs reason antibiotic overuse leads much rapid development antibiotic resistant bacteria.

I wasn‚Äôt trying argue shouldn‚Äôt vaccinate people apologize wasn‚Äôt clear original comment. right long run vaccinations reduce infection rates help reduce development variants. I‚Äôm saying variants spreading unfortunately something likely see near future result rapidly vaccinating populations widespread transmission ongoing. girlfriend received doses Pfizer vaccine. week two second dose, contact positive patient hospital knew patient COVID. called nasal swab test came back negative.

Take whatever will. guaranteed would've gotten sick without vaccine. knew eventually would happen. knew _some day_ eventually would exposed without N95/negative pressure room. potentially drag home.  true, aren‚Äôt recommended pregnant people stage. Someone pregnant still get vaccine, talk doctors get okay first. vaccine impacts ability poop! There's information that! vaccine turns human torch??? anyone come said specifically possible?  guess I‚Äôm saying mutations dropping neutralization rate vaccines isn‚Äôt end world 

I agree, I'm pro-vaxx myself, som3thing need monitor prepare continues doesn‚Äôt mean continue use distancing masks everyone‚Äôs (80% probably max) vaccinated vaccines neutralization effectiveness might go down.

If actually happens, agree, think we'll get 80% population vaccinated anytime soon. hope I'm mutation causes virus bypass neutralization vaccine built immunity *does result serious illness* transitioned novel virus (a new virus bodies don‚Äôt idea fight) virus experience fighting - like *every virus humans overcome*.

The issue comes kind mutations happen. true new variants shown deadly, thank God, they're transmissable. I'm betting gal, dunno it'll stay way long, like hope want take precautions covid - may well lock homes wear masks forever.... one wants that.

There's ton middle ground zero cases, though. I'm sure draw line, we're gonna wait see serious illness hospitalization *in most* enough get us back living.

My personal reflections (as aptly quoted) ""tightening"" entirely emphasis recommendations, well bi-weekly reporting rising pressure healthcare made around say decide things like ""ok fine, we'll celebrate christmas travel year"", really /really/ try work home minimize crowds risky activities. 

The legal changes something needed commit memory already kinda obvious, guess signal value  Plus clear long second dose tested positive.  Imagine continuing peddle absolute myth that, social isolation, parental stress/unemployment, visible timeline enjoy activities anymore. don‚Äôt know yet. it‚Äôs entirely possible, even plausible, asymptomatic vaccinated person lower virus titers would therefore less likely transmit others. want hear. Info straight horse's mouth!

I prefer something statistically significant. Like real studies... Wow! Science works - novel concept Thanks! one who's trouble that, bud. Obviously it‚Äôs Rothschilds finally decided turn space laser kill virus stole election Trump. 

Wait, republicans still think virus hoax? so, disregard explanation. congressman received second dose Pfizer vaccine tested negative Covid-19 attending President Joe Biden's inauguration January 20, Tarpey said. specify Lynch received dose vaccine.

Covid-19 vaccines prevent illness, necessarily prevent infection. someone tests positive get sick, vaccine worked intended. someone tests positive within weeks receiving second dose, may vaccine yet fully kicked in.  Lol edited comment saw theres instead moderna. Vaccine myths? Who‚Äôs comment read?  one knows vaccine effect year 10 years now. one time collect data.  comment, nurses work haven‚Äôt taken young afraid unknown.  nothing false studies autism propaganda people tagged MMR VACCINE.

I vaccine.  Don‚Äôt assume ignorance reason aren‚Äôt choosing get yet.  mandate closures, could see places wanting push masks and/or social distancing since damage economy. got vaccines 13 16w pregnant.

The vaccines authorized use pregnant people, someone must've forgotten ask whether pregnant, report it.  Whats happening Canada? tried Google, got they'd ordered vaccines per capita world. It‚Äôs pretty clear Fauci‚Äôs messaging can‚Äôt immediately go back normal second vaccinated need see happens. He‚Äôs saying we‚Äôre going wearing masks forever. He‚Äôs saying need patient. need slowly reopen keeping precautions place know everything working. It‚Äôs going process. faster vaccinate slower mutations occur decreased transmission. Infections ripping right now. Every new case opportunity shit head virus mutate. 

We really need get done ASAP. ways already late current set prominent variants. Can't keep waiting car wrapped around tree hit brakes. is, there's OML like everything else  post 9-11 didnt want increased security ie thought would hurt bottom line. think require testing 20-50% whatever bother flying. care money, safety Community spread never end, thinking that's gonna happen unrealistic. need get serious cases control vaccines regardless variant Oh, man, good laugh. Lol figures too. 

I‚Äôve heard usually follows second dose Ah easy vaccine, that's still flu Chamber Commerce also warn UK US export bans vaccines? hard notice effect vaccine, current wave likely end then, due seasonality. Hopefully, enough people get vaccinated spring summer avoid another huge wave fall. That's works. living Indonesia required rapidtest IgM fly anywhere domestically, eventually required Antigen test fly Bali domestically needed PCR NYE holidays.

I think we'll require boosters. 

The idea ""endemic"" covid (new variants) keep immune systems primed even newer variants. We'll get infected, develop much disease. Like asymptomatic infection, every new variant, upping breadth immunity.

Good news even antivax dolts would similar protection previous infections.

Yes, actually. would done lot sooner took approach March public would receptive it. 80% really goal going back normal. fully vaccinate 15-20%, 15-20% old and/or immunocompromised people, deaths covid comparable deaths flu, definitely low enough reopen everything. Johnson &amp; Johnson really help too. guess everyone nose exposed ignorant, really trying. wear medical tape top mask prevent eye shield fogging, I'd recommend trying that. Also right pretty much doctors health care workers getting vaccinated, I've never doctor white asian, suprise less latinos getting vaccinated. questioning they‚Äôre testing everyone sure it‚Äôs spread they‚Äôre making schools follow guidelines.

Almost high risk students pulled due doctors suggestions- it‚Äôs questioning data. really schools ability follow cdc guidelines.

Even social distancing ‚Äúwhen feasible‚Äù say it‚Äôs feasible don‚Äôt it. school bus 3 kids every seat like normal. us giving kids mask breaks, kids exempt wearing masks. 

I desperately want school going back normal. issue can‚Äôt good job teaching given day might get pulled another classroom due illness, close 11am 4 teachers tested positive, don‚Äôt know teaching get work. wasn‚Äôt asked teach kids home school time they‚Äôd actually learning. 

If schools open critical economy invest like is. budget slashed start school sanitizing wipes donated. It‚Äôs cost prohibitive 15-16 subs day normally 3-4, drive whole bus get one kid.

You know blood tested vaccination worked you, right? Bullshit opinion.

""Medical worker"" includes everyone hospital staff, includes lots people nothing COVID easily work home. understand convenient way quickly vax bunch people guess there's theoretical limit mad come on.

American political discourse founded ridiculous virtue signals response prime example. Everyone works hospital saint. (How explain Scott Atlas? get fucked).

Every old person sits home angrily spreading conspiracy theories Facebook. MIL sits home unable shop herself. 

Give fucking break. EU wants _ability_ block exports.

The US meanwhile blocked exports day one. they're good guys.  problem actually didn‚Äôt run 1A candidates. precise U.K. plants allowed export produced number vaccines contractually obliged to. 

There U.K. ban exports, raw material AZ vaccine produced shipped EU India? key expects complete clinical trial experimental COVID-19 vaccine next weeks, already working manufacturing able reach full production capacity quickly, Chief Executive Officer Stanley Erck said.  full capacity starting May June, maybe much one hundred fifty million doses per month globally,‚Äù said.

150M doses per month *globally*. said expects several weeks Novavax files trial data regulators United Kingdom, Europe elsewhere, meaning full review authorization vaccine could take ‚Äúa couple months.‚Äù  begin scaling vaccine production February March, expects production ramped second quarter, along production Serum Institute partners South Korea Japan, Erck said.

It'll months local approval start shipping appreciable quantities vaccine country. said 16,000 volunteers already taken part U.S. trial likely hit target 30,000 participants early-to-mid February. company would observe six weeks reviewing results, added.

So US trial results hopefully sometime April. illness called COVID-19 associated country people?

then calling ""South Africa variant""? seriously can't believe they've dooming long.

I made subreddit stupid COVID comments, shits &amp; giggles, thinking it'd take 3 months calm down.

Nope. 11 months later, still going.  couple weeks ago woke sweat breathing heavy 4 hours. girlfriend insisted go hospital insurance. thought actually dying, started getting really shaky went away.
Got tested days felt like absolute shit, accidentally called work next day. 
I came back negative. EU considering cutting exports Canada. trying threaten UK brexit.

That said, everyone facilities. era globalism relying countries across world vital supplies over. Borders going back up, countries taking care first foremost. Tribalism natural state mankind. Might well embrace become self sufficient.

I'm sure FN Belgium supply turrets case want protect southern border, though. COVID bad lost chunk global elderly population? would ship Canada anyway, didn‚Äôt close border US? would ‚Äúexception‚Äù? Honestly, (and never thought I‚Äôd say Californian lol), consider moving Colorado. metropolitan areas quite jobs fields. governor already said expects lift restrictions next couple months. haven‚Äôt stay-at-home order since April last year. Could elaborate specific ‚Äúdenying science‚Äù? Nobody knows anything. still can't even say people get bad covid19 others don't. hilarious. 

My coworker healthy 35-year-old wife die last month it...nobody knows why. vent month. People hypothesize however want.  EUA FDA approval two doses spaced 21 28 days apart.  advice cited followed vaccine work well, guys suffer way?  say ""oopsie, bad.  sorry anyone got sick died due following hypothesis""   

Where ""gold standard"" testing shit heard months possible treatments people died? South African strain come ? Okay time shut country down. Yh vaccination programme dissapontingly slow comparison Israel, Us UK although tbf supply seems much limited. I'm optimistic supply starts ease like maybe March able massively speed daily vaccinations. saw happen US/Uk December slow month. behind think could still reach normality end year latest.

Curious though long Ontario lockdown for? provinces also stay home order? 2 cents this... EMA full approvement emergency one. takes longer... guess start approving vaccines see data finished (phase 3 closed). 

So know way start distributing pre stockpiled vaccine..so basically approvement start sign go live 2 days... That's looked moderna biontech/ Pfizer think back... 

This offense (personal) observation. saw somewhere said India ordered 1 billion doses. eyes nearly popped head  adenovirus technology J&amp;J AZ vaccines work multiple doses anyway. top that, never get another vaccine based similar adenovirus. vaccines side effect creating immunity delivery systems. reason lockdowns/mask wearing/social distancing prevent hospitals getting overrun stop people dying. 

So understand anything full year shit. need get *infections* down, freaking disease also *severely* hurts people never go hospital. slap? I've read, prevents severe illness death 66% time, offer protection getting mildly ill? not, would prevent people get vaccine spreading covid others? still get sick getting shot, would prevent able spread covid people?  clear goals reach support stick also help. heroic participate trial.  Guardian article recently posted r/Europe says this:

Canadians get Pfizer vaccine, AZ. Try troll intelligently Yes do.................. Also, far know taking J&amp;J vaccine mean can't take one mRNA vaccines line supplies plentiful. Even one ideal, still absolutely use get much protection possible little time possible. Months ago hoping vaccine would 70% effective.

You maybe, ""we"" definitely expecting shit vaccine. Want explain California's situation last weeks? way? literally fired people involved. could want? build time machine undo mistake? Why? mutation causing higher transmission rates UK strain present South African strain well? Canadian government limited international travel four airports last March. Oh hey I've seen buffalo subreddit I'll take ""someone needs count blessings"" 200 Alex...

(Canadian here) hope everyone calling lockdown extended reads story takes note harm government causing. party pooper, hasn‚Äôt every vaccine far proven 100% effective stopping deaths? media bashing reporters went journalism school bother read abstract.  see 66% recall seeing 95% Pfizer, go.

Some reporters, especially specialty media, actually read digest actual numbers. either succesfully vaccinated not. 1 20 not. get antibody count (titre) tested basic ""Do antibody not"" test.

Vaccinated *as group* 95% less likely get sick, individual people either or. UK perfectly able act independently EU, would have. That's absolutely true. Unfortunately, approach countries Europe North America like yo-yo dieter lose weight can't keep (because immediately go back normal reach goal). Thanks. wish people would stop linking articles trash site. don't... whole thing super pissed off. 30 y/o boyfriend works healthcare consultant work 100% remote. He‚Äôs getting vaccine Sunday he‚Äôs hEaLtHcArE. dad 59, recently suffered heart attack, truck driver delivers multiple times/day Los Angeles. dad risking life every single day mortified may contract virus day now. adults chance vaccinated won‚Äôt matter wish best, also limbo meeting someone due covid. It‚Äôs hard. would nice elected officials would focus encouraging people every race get vaccinated. would even better worked hard increase vaccine supply distribution don‚Äôt gatekeep who‚Äôs eligible wait. Media: (insert whatever baseline is) vaccines per day enough get rid COVID shot you. no,

you standing pool full gasoline neck, knee deep.

&amp;#x200B;

Still means Uncle bob shouldnt juggling burning things right next it.  Lmao think that's enough release single dosage alternative? fever cough, cough sore throat, already counts moderate 2 symptoms condition. Thank much waking that! really appreciate details. It‚Äôs exactly trying understand. Obviously, they're talking Mick Dundee. They‚Äôd end people would follow less less drag on. vaccines become useless, people give anyways. 

Most everyone breaking point... drag goalposts, successive ‚Äúhere‚Äôs new reason terrified!‚Äù, people throw hands. position relies ignoring fact AZ fact contractual obligations people EU, fact firm similar position would. clearly relevant BRE extent obligation deliver. BRE simply mean deliver every permissable vaccine available EU. Bloomberg 28.9 mil No, that's AD36 modified adenovirus vaccine. Still pretty new delivery mechanism new RNA vaccines. California LA county? I‚Äôm saying schools can‚Äôt open. kids wear masks/be distanced since still catch covid spread virus homes, either kids general adult population (their parents) vaccinated. new Coronavirus...hangovers Coronas drank get together point hindsight better 6 month old article clear facts confirm. lose mind thinking it. can't keep opening closing world. global economy collapse whole industries. point learn live like pathogens since dawn humanity. sold cost everywhere According 5 cases ""within UofM community""

Even give odds order actually making college students stay home less 0%

This also [not first time they've issued order like guarantee students sick hearing it. Natural infection effective though.

I mean, ideal person ideal immunity post-covid, maybe true. compare IgG S-protein associated memory cells, vaccines produce much antibodies actual COVID. 3 times average. Maaaybe arrange prime-boost method actual corona get better result, come on. Imagine that.

mRNA encoded S-protein. like adenoviral vectors. end produce antibodies like adenoviral vector vaccines do. mRNA adenoviral vectors messengers. S-protein message. both.

The vaccines substantially different close natural immunity inactivated ones. messengers messages time, one. layman terms, that's actual living breathing corona, castrated: replication gene complex zapped out, well others, good measure, cause disease can't infect anyone. someone jabbed one, immunity produce antibodies towards S-protein, top another antibodies proteins, like make viral capsid, antibodies may may immunocompetent.

This may important. S-protein important target antibodies knowledge, also fastest change mutations. virus mutates far enough there, far IgG recognize anymore, we'll produce new vaccines targeting protein = mRNA adenoviral vaccines COVID is. Inactivated vaccines might avoid issue extent. said, proteins living virus may cause issues immunity, might produce immunoincompetent antibodies towards proteins. Duds, lack better word. Best case scenario, useless. Worst case, might ADE, antibody-dependent enhancement disease. long S-protein antibodies work, issue, stop, might turn dengue disaster 2.0. even unknown: antibodies towards N-protein SARS-Cov-1 caused pneumonia mice SARS exposure. sure can't happen SARS-Cov-2 humans? 

This people recovered COVID still advised take shot boost immunity SARS-Cov-2 time. way sure enough memory cells even IgG respond COVID properly long run, like unexposed people shot. depends metric want use. would use unemployment rates, metric tends react strongly well economy  Ouch. soul.... think grievance root problem. problem people see expertise sense loss control. kooky theories way reassert control insisting expert smart think are. I‚Äôm talking everything. I‚Äôm talking Brexit. distortion mental gymnastics see. they‚Äôre working getting military assist they‚Äôre enough doses available. hopefully J&amp;J soon-ish. Oxford novavax hopefully happen. biotech? Drug/vaccine development always high risk failure fundamentally nature. 

If EU trouble one vaccine pan out, that's catastrophicly poor planning part. US number ways could supply Moderna BioNtech failed. 

You claimed US gambling first post, seems EU fits definition way US. irrefutable evidence emerged China accidentally let lab trying learn coronavirus at. Would consequence? be? came across reminded post. find legitimate think Alabama relatives worn mask since started. doesn‚Äôt work certain extent? There‚Äôs research showing people get yearly flu vaccines less protected people vaccinated year- ie, getting yearly vaccines flu makes less effective you. anti-science take going use defend position? may look like much, got counts, kid. know prevent long covid. Asymptomatic cases suffer later effects stands reason faulty vaccine one would protect long term effects.  earlier year.  1% *so far*

my main point need continue wearing masks, social distancing, &amp; staying home everyone vaccinated. give us huge benefit read today phizer moderna test subjects screened two year period well. 7-8% really mean much, given capacities EU. nonsensical argument first place, also foolish assume UK would ""win"". Herd immunity, said. Kids major piece puzzle solve this. still 50% population unvaccinated without children. (78% adults * 64% say get vaccine = 50%). 50% unvaccinated kids also people generations, also include unable vaccinated due health reasons. although almost surely lot society commerce open up, hospitals still full. sick constantly test efficacy vaccines people getting (they suits armor). spread virus continue opportunity mutate new variants. hope seems organizations modeling waves due new variants prolonging please answer , vaccine available chinese one , take it? , im afraid family , vaccine rollout started weeks bit slow , dont get choose pfizer chinese variants , idea thought? probably better AZ reputation too. EU dysfunctional, consists powerful countries, largest single market western world. end rule short enough was. peer reviewed yet purpose study determine efficacy vaccine

what found lab mice immune, mice cant infected. end study, original covid virus using mutated N501Y mutation, ever found UK version. mutation allowed infect mice That's 66% tested new variants. Pfizer Moderna's 95% unlikely hold new variants. It‚Äôs right though Ah ok thanks know EU come looking like petulant child tbh outcome probably better accepted AZ excuses I‚Äôve heard couple incidents involving thousand vaccines. We‚Äôve administered ~26 million doses, ~10k/26,000k = 0.04%.

Unless there‚Äôs something I‚Äôm missing, number doses spoiled pretty negligible compared big picture. seems pretty disingenuous characterize America‚Äôs vaccine rollout ‚Äúkeep getting spoiled they‚Äôre applied fast enough‚Äù it‚Äôs something happens ~4-5 times 10,000 doses administered. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.

Serbia we're rolling Sinopharm Sinovac, aside fron Sputnik Pfizer, sure efficacy Sinovac one. Thank you! sentence clearly states - purpose section 5.4 only. would agree said - purpose section 5 only. However case. 

If uk EU applied whole section 5 would stated start, least, brackets first time EU mentioned. Fuck outta stupid ass article.   Got it, permanent lockdown rest lives.

Or people accept 1% death rate move lives, salty makes you. says ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt know‚Äù. Children definitely transmit, much less adults still source contention. distribution apparatus built, though, it‚Äôs easy reuse ally takes money sends nothing return? ally. 

And nerve talk condescending Canadians spent summer calling Americans plague rats US third world country. UK funded creation vaccine, released licence free help world.

The UK contributed ‚Ç¨620 Million worldwide COVAX AMC. LOT money. fact ‚Ç¨100 Million EU contributed, despite 5X bigger. Yeah la county weird beast. Restraurants breaking rules opening got publicly shamed. tons open, even banded together Instagram we‚Äôre taking open table reservations. shaming. happy go. People seem much ok life hold indefinitely. heard Newport Beach tons bars open, one weekend might check out. Life gonna get back normal here. maybe La long time opinion. 

How commute non-Covid times? bette worse reverse? German newspaper right actually find cases new variant area? Attempting lock college students going really, really short shelf life point, almost year in. Ah. 

There is. even talking about? 
BioNTech German company Germany extremely low vaccination rate, even within EU. 

Germany helped countries taking hospitalized patients throughout entire pandemic. 

Germany one last close export PPE, leading MASSIVE shortages within country. 

Germany one of, the, collaborative country throughout entire pandemic. need wannabe wise internet warriors like yourself. real positive. PR-Speak.

""Nobody vaccinated group got hospitalised!"" 

""Yeah well many got hospitalized placebo group?""

""uhm, 1""

""So statistically relevant, it?""

The Biontech vaccination also nobody hospitalised trails, Isreal 16 people hospitalised shots immune.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  Yep that's pretty much it. I'd look benchmarks details that's evidence multiple independent sources says. Maybe EU heeded Sanofis CEOs warning last May EU risk falling behind US needs invest aggressively vaccines.

Sanofi _reason_ EU behind. Maybe guy made decent vaccine instead lobbying buy fewer Pfizer doses giving up? kids vaccinated, stuff matter. LA like ghost town around holidays one native return home. 

I wonder year. Exactly. center trust debate sides guilty playing political games. One side maybe worse certainly alone. good! Completely chaotic guess haha I‚Äôm glad  trying get online appointment 70+ year old parents California nothing worked. twat  found mean there, agree. 

The EU looked. EU incompetence happen? find Canada AZ one, PfiZer Moderna vaccines seem effective.

Why EU causing bother AZ vaccine then? Even shamefully risking peace Northern UK might receiving shots, even yours!!!

How could UK receiving Canadian shots? talking about? f Moderna isn‚Äôt reputable, Chinese Military Canada sent hundreds millions ‚Äúresearch‚Äù?

An ally, seeing US unhelpful condescending towards Canada? March, COVID making way Europe ""racist"" card fails. Two outta three ain't bad. Except vaccine  Well trust seem worth much since failed hold even single person institution responsible 400k deaths instead continue trust institutions failed. 

You can't even prosecute obvious inside traders profited COVID what's trust worth? Jack shit. seems issue prioritising fulfilling UK order vaccine already approved there, 

So best fulfill early obligations sooner UK order fulfilled quicker could use facilities supply EU.

It would seem shipping 5mn EU doses UK due non-approval EU would also imply shipping 5mn doses UK EU soon approved EU. Returning vaccines Q4 longer needed would ridiculous. fact that, large, vaccines using spike way immune system trigger response. 

Add fact variants seem change aspect result effective wide-spread vaccine. read article problems supposedly solved European plants AZ deliver doses promised. hope means EU UK gets doses entitled vaccine war ended.   Just.poking fun lovelife past epidemic Hey, that's joke. I'm ready stabbing Mr. DeMille. See keep hearing kids dont tend issues CHILDREN'S hospital mom works covid ward hundreds kids near (in?) Seattle take statements grain salt. US Europe developed vaccines.  South America, Africa underdeveloped SE Asia resources. New Zealand plenty resources develop vaccines.  didn't. back line go. say ten-fold? Everybody understands ten times many. Using 1000% irresponsible journalism. inform clarify, meant astound confuse. point people a, ""stuffy nose"" give virus reserve mutate vaccine resistance end back started.  Like cons want privatize everything? think that's bulk them. 2 managers go US mexico needed break. quarintined return home work home. Could? That‚Äôs floating around everywhere wild. It‚Äôs proven yet it‚Äôs plausible vaccines give sterilizing immunity. means got large share population vaccinated - won‚Äôt need put ‚Äújust 66%‚Äù test. someone covid sneezed face still 66% chance illness 100% chance hospitalized. Yes. Visit click country top. one winners situation, however EU choice pressure AZ deliver promised. Essence EU would never contracted paid production vaccines knew AZ‚Äôs interpretation agreement. fair Canada contracts 300% population fully vaccinated. US 150%. deadly good bacteria virus. ""goal"" kill anyone, spread widely possible.  countries contributed? NO! Time Buy Actual Bane Masks Everyone... don‚Äôt... extremely painful! breathe air... wanting survive pandemic I‚Äôm somehow blind fact rich get richer, exploit everyone isn‚Äôt them, pay governments politicians? Maybe I‚Äôm worried living fight another day, literally, fight income equality.

Not taking this, other, vaccine doesn‚Äôt prove anything anyone. 

Does pharma make lot money? Yes 

Does care get vaccinated? No, less drop vast ocean them.

So fight ‚ÄòI‚Äôll show them‚Äô war proves nothing best stay alive fight what‚Äôs right soon enough. 

Now time, place, time draws nigh.

I don‚Äôt understand whose ass I‚Äôm deep I‚Äôm test subject in. European Union forced lockdowns upon Member States, national governments late act see lockdowns tool mitigate stuff reach immunity. Maybe listen less risk-averse public health experts. know stop variants like this? Border closures travel restrictions quarantines, everyone done Brazil long ago mean, kidney, got *two*. new strains great  many around here. best part say biology student something still understand something basic. 150 USD, free look links? organ failure hour two, need get *hospitalized* it, anything. Quick question. took rapid test came back positive. I‚Äôve heard rapid test always accurate I‚Äôve booked lab test. hope results come back negative? would think Conservative leader like Kurz would likely open quickly, apparently second wave fall inflicted sort trauma Austria Europe. many retired Covid? 

Dunno, [up 15% shown signs heart know SA variant contagious UK California variants? possibility one new variants could extinct it? things aren‚Äôt ‚Äúreopened‚Äù? Americans stopped giving shit fighting virus months ago, 4,000 per day dying while.  paste URL private window access behind schedule? roughly 30 days q1 91, based expect 32.9m doses point, pretty spot ask me. asked actual data trial. makes sense. unprecedented concept. example Older individuals get high dose flu shot. similar concept - different administration. volume game - get younger folks single dose older folks Pfizer/moderna 1st half great shape. Oh, 5 COVID deaths, placebo group. something could happen, mean will.  pick nuclear option, case. vaccine faulty, needs time. show every extra week goes person seems protection. Everyone got vaccine avoided death outcomes. RNA vax better? unclear, require second dose efficiency reported second dose weeks later apples-to-apples. Maybe improve one second dose tweak. want thread? Give actionable, otherwise you‚Äôre posturing absolutely idea. incredibly unfair. J&amp;J results darn good, combine attractive aspects J&amp;J vaccine, huge. Also makes wonder long would world get type vaccine COVID. many similar advances right can't get FDA. 

Sure FDA prevents bad drugs getting making things take decades, many good ones stopping? Perhaps. ADE? Various immune system issues? 

Again, there's reason things tested giving hundreds millions people. America. shitty vaccine given vulnerable. say need effective vaccine folks already got vaccine, even though 4 10I guess completely SOL worst disease since Black Death. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Canada enough doses four times population size. We're better every country combined. me, important aspect rate catching disease peak immunity. efficacy numbers include infections immunity vaccine fully reached. Pfizer (from Israel vaccination numbers), week received second dose, 20 roughly 128,600 people, 0.01 percent, contract virus. lot better 5% getting might expectation hearing ""95% effective"". Similarly, J&amp;J, 100% protected severe symptoms death day 49 lot meaningful day 28 numbers peak immunity reached. careful couple months close 100% point really matter get. I've phase 1 trial since August. Apparently they're going tell us got placebo sometime next month so. Super bowl??? Lions playoff game since 1992  believe saw quote saying hospitalizations  There's progress too.

As kid (in 1995-ish) got 11 shots total bitten stray dog. 

7 stomach, 4 arm. Disagree. would take one case little bad luck major outbreak. people deserve protected much country. Yeah bit 400 cases COVID. would death rate ~5%, extremely high general population. Yes, ENSEMBLE ENSEMBLE 2 duration. look up, thought Lions defunct decades ago. reading lot articles, lot scientific data reading comments educated people, I've drawn 2 definite conclusions. first one is, immensely grateful scientists. second one is, someone paid salaries professional athletes, athletes. scientists outstanding medical professionals keeping us suffering extinction. heartfelt gratitude goes them. unblinded still study

This study? told ask unblinded, study, period. likely see booster shots new variants time year? around died 

Cool, nursing home live in? Sections 5.1 5.3 set quantites timeframes fixed order (""Initial Europe Doses""), Options eventual Additional Orders. sourcing production including sites used set section 5.4. two different issues  Well, 44,325 people involved. aware that. source this?

Not believe true, wan't go repeating unless back up. sold cost everywhere duration pandemic perpetuity low middle-income countries. agree. Canadian here. wish US nothing best keep going strong. guys started strong 2021 rough year - offence. confident Canada far behind guys getting back normal. get back planning families 2 3 trips year country. virus this. Covid nothing Influenza comes mutating.

It's year widespread uncontrolled infection barely started see variants partially escape immunity.  Yeah I'll pass shitty vaccine. ain't anti Vax I'm anti chances. Fuck gimme Pfizer. know people would theoretically prefer Moderna Pfizer, would anyone seriously decline covid vaccine (in practice), vaccine option available? there's reason public officials publicly state 100% fine.

That mean can't rational discussions possibilities likelihood.

Do see mechanism would safety concern?


edit: rational reason concern, NHS authorize mix match absolutely to:  really depends much air moving whether downwind specific person it. Granted, like indoors specific person get everyone dose covid air. variants less prevalent U.S. population action taken them.

Like what? Social distance, vaccinations, mask wearing...? Things we're already supposed doing?

The pharma companies already coming boosters variants. Chinese, think great news. wish good health! summer weddings (yay!) hopeful! awesome appears. Notice data article. Deaths still rising everything else falls. Remember back news broke hospitals capacity? tells new cases people either poor afford hospitals hospitals can‚Äôt take more, therefore new hospitalizations default President aside, deaths rise hospitalizations fall, meanwhile know California hospitals full poverty/homelessness extreme there. says new victims poor hospital can‚Äôt get Premature reopening already gaining steam. Gov ny said restaurant open indoor dining (25% capacity) vday USA average 4.6 according CDC, agree LA lower.

It lower, literally cannot 4.6x without increasing population size millions. absolute current maximum multiplier possible LA county 2.08. Pretty much inline JAMA paper. seroprevalence link early November number confirmed cases tripled since then.

The original CDC estimate September... dropped estimate since despite extending data December. CDC model based 2009 H1N1. I'd rather go one based serology modeling different terms double peak, definition herd immunity, R drops 0.99. Increased travel results number 1.0 cases rise again. unstable system minor behavioral changes enormous effects cases, population regains herd immunity.

That fit definition herd immunity (and also fit model reference allow resurgence cases restrictions removed). describing changes mobility causing decreases increases cases. literally making case mobility root cause changes infection levels... That‚Äôs different story. guy literally murdered lethal injections clear space. Anddddd ima still going refuse mine.... got fellas. Nothing worry about! That's everyone hopes.

But EU Commission throwing toys pram hissy fit done favours world stage.

European countries arms EU's conduct this. 
Their wholesale mismanagement whole affair literally costing lives. Yay! Good couples. Perth Bali flights pretty much annual retreat lot people, especially west aussies. 

I've 9 times, there's lot see Indonesia. Many islands, many adventures. 

Cost return airfare bali like $89 4 hour travel time. 

Singapore I've 3 times. hub, hawkers markets great, marina bay sands amazing, clarke quay amazing, gardens bay, etc. 

Malaysia 3 times. Shopping KL insane, food much better. 

Thailand twice. Phuket, next time Koh Samui, Koh Tao, Koh Pha Ngan. 

Vietnam twice. mean, Vietnam fucking amazing country history buff like ooooh boy. 

Perth Thailand, let's say Phuket, ~9 hours. 

Closest state US Thailand Hawaii that's 13 hours. awesome appears. Notice data article. Deaths still rising everything else falls. Remember back news broke hospitals capacity? tells new cases people either poor afford hospitals hospitals can‚Äôt take more, therefore new hospitalizations default I'm even lockdown person either, weddings seem one worst perpetrators spreading virus. Maybe vaccines made difference then, doubt it. Good point. elderly relatives signing vaccine ""god control"". That's words magic spell absolves personal responsibility need care anyone anything. That‚Äôs awfully big way things going. Definitely near 65 lol

And macron wrong , established. already schools deny admission kids vaccinated. So, work along lines. course, can't minor stuff like, can't enter mall coz vaccinated major stuff like flights, university etc state lists cases even 1 schools daycares (it‚Äôs 5 workplaces) - current resolved. Per individual school. Well it‚Äôs 200m doses June 100m get Pfizer 100m get moderna, 20m might choose get vaccine get J&amp;J one 16 days long time full approval? I‚Äôm looking you, Jerry. Yes right eventually vaccinations speed up. poorer countries suffer awhile. bears boonies Sounds like EU wants bully UK vaccine doses. I‚Äôm UK vaccinating many since much smaller comparison EU. doesn‚Äôt EU countries completely vaccinated? hold opening everything enough people vaccinated. metric? 2-4 cases ever school city? country? US states trackers gov websites school outbreaks it‚Äôs pretty easy anyone see extremely common is. Username checks out. you‚Äôre young healthy person options might JNJ wait. Look, mRNA clearly better individual. J&amp;J good community. 

If individual choice, choice Hey, Johnson Johnson, remember one time spent like thirty years actively working hide fact giving cancer babies? Yeah, gonna say emptied trust bucket little bit one. Let us come country we‚Äôll think about. Different. everyone get vaccine gets one three, really matter one got. point outnumber flu start getting bit influenza booster annual covid shot? actually work way: found coronavirus vaccine‚Äôs effectiveness may higher 70 percent even 80 percent

Oups meant academic studies, yep I'm right wrong. accept move science denier. ""All confirmed"" lmao remind read that? Facebook? Ah yes, curse enjoying web content made low budget without professional editor around 

""I enjoy work would nice audio right channel quiet mouse farting could drown out"" Positivity rate really good figure extrapolate on. People get tested generally people close contacts feel symptoms. vast majority rest population, things apply. completely reasonable expect positivity rate test significantly higher remainder population. Yeah guys internet. like reality different Texas local government says different. work Texans (via telecommute) obstinate people, kind believe things like ""the virus real"" ""the virus bad say"" ""the masks sociological control.""  can't say that's case Texans also excuse guy's actions simply lives Texas. day age state borders excuse ignorance.

With said hope recovers fully. true, special storage still lot easier freezer. BJ PB&amp;J everyday Yes 50% largest spike put hospital beds 100% full.

I‚Äôd like see buffer case get Covid go hospital worried space. Yes does. point public spread virus less, spreads lethal. 66% public immune chances catching already dropped half. vaccine even unlucky enough exposed still, you‚Äôre likely immune entirely. 
 
But every dummy doesn‚Äôt take want wait another six months one that‚Äôs 30% effective, everyone‚Äôs chances *increased* 60% meantime. Take now. Six months later booster anyway. probably yearly that. goal still 1m - 1.5m. really push forward vaccines. mRNA future much easier store therefore distribute, it'll simply option people. I'd rather moderate protection faster herd immunity via widespread vaccinations wait months months effective vaccine, chance getting infected. old you? 

Macron said afternoon AstraZeneca basically ineffective 65, possibly even ‚ÄúThe real problem AstraZeneca doesn‚Äôt work way expecting to,‚Äù Macron told group reporters, including POLITICO, Paris. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre waiting EMA [European Medicines Agency] results, today everything points thinking quasi-ineffective people older 65, say 60 years older.‚Äù dude? People listening Dr. Fauchi hundreds millions Americans dead wearing mask allegedly affront personal freedom. hasn‚Äôt exactly gone well. Excepts death main concern people months now, concern long term health effects getting disease, 95% better odds getting said health effects 72% like 3 cases people survived. Crazy yes wait June move goalposts tell us there‚Äôs enough vaccine then? Got entire family works schools different states. One whole side came it, caught school. 

I going back without vaccine. hope February mass distributing countries enough everyone US? So, UK US since beginning. It‚Äôs ok. EU it‚Äôs bad? Ridiculous constantly say things researchers around world saying long time? It‚Äôs 8x less effective. It‚Äôs 66% effective one dose. That‚Äôs lower effectiveness one dose Moderna Pfizer vaccine.

Plus, mixing vaccine doses brands recommended yet medical experts, medical experts leaving option open discretion.

If know can‚Äôt get Pfizer vaccine month now, get Johnson Johnson one tomorrow, it‚Äôs 66% effective get Johnson Johnson one. That's confirmed cases

The US chronically undertests badly outlandish real number right around triple much hate admit it, think visibility repubs who've already gotten vaccine helped push lot skeptical right accept (I'm still fucking mad people profited pandemic downplayed seriousness months got vaccines tons elderly people needed it, oh well). Avoid spreading misinformation. great, can't tell boss I'm going carry deadly virus workplace, I'm going allowed in. thing drives nuts still poor understanding impacts disease even are. 

Plenty ""asymptomatic"" people end organ damage. people end neurological symptoms, really know mechanisms cause those. know virus trigger inflammation issues, also know virus directly infect central nervous system (including brain). know neurotropic, seem know much beyond that.

We still triage mode, vast majority scientific information focused immediate, known dangers. generally associated respiratory system. 

However, seem know much neurotropic aspects disease. long term impacts people experiencing, frequency? Neurotropic diseases terrifyingly destructive, showing symptoms damage done. Rabies one example: able get treatment start showing symptoms, chance survival literally 0%, symptoms may appear months (rarely) even years.

This common cold. little understanding people's brains injured disease, much less understanding much existing vaccines prevent damage. non-American university research matter Eh, much important get virus avoid hospitalization. I'm much worried ""mild"" case fucks heart lungs. celebration üéâ let‚Äôs gooooooooooo it‚Äôs garbage compared Pfizer moderna.

I hope get vaccines choose one want take. risking thing 90% good vaccines. definitely. thought Americans believed wore mask (or maybe two) negative effects obesity would disappear ;) Yeah, unfortunate companies decide run one-dose trials. understand one point people say Moderna single dose? anything moderna single dose news? That's im trying figure clearly remember hearing something Moderna single doses past Im trying confirm something/story like actually happened (or made head). Yet supposedly withstanding new strains posts seen. June weeks told Hannity Fox News personalities Covid completely stopped lethal anymore -- sun belt state cases started spiking, yet deaths -- least ~4 weeks later deaths also started uptick turned large spike (it takes time people get sick enough die). think already missed us market aren‚Äôt all. 2-4 cases most. It‚Äôs mostly care homes, prisons, warehouse/grocery store workplaces food processing here. It‚Äôs 100% effective preventing hospitalization death. fantastic news. said isn‚Äôt really maximum age, gets harder different older get. you‚Äôre early 20s it‚Äôs easy get group friends together go music fest spring break party location destination event party (think Mardi Gras). you‚Äôre strangers cool talking hanging people around age. get late 20s early 30s people responsibilities. Vacation days used attend weddings. Friends move away work. normally still find want go party experience big events. Mid late 30s things get little rough. Finding people go really difficult. You‚Äôll probably bored go alone b/c early 20 somethings don‚Äôt want talk hang random person 10-15 years older them. Younger people look funny b/c think partying something magically stop 30 anyone older still partying must problem.

Again events tons fun, even you‚Äôre older, different take shine it. Honestly good friends doesn‚Äôt matter old anyone thinks, fun.   I‚Äôm around significant health issues 24/7 currently. health concerns many live with. Fair enough. measures think taken limit spread? typically don‚Äôt agree people COVID regulations I‚Äôm personally high risk barely left house year, I‚Äôm 30 lucky enough work home it‚Äôs hard feel comfortable even store bc lack masks. Also seem trying limit spread keep risk/elderly safe I‚Äôm curious could elaborate more. trying argue Im genuinely asking opinion. I'm sure great healthcare plan. cares interested ? LOL don‚Äôt want J&amp;J vaccine... want good stuff. mRNA shots Pfizer Moderna.  Apparently difference might due earlier vaccines done clinical trials new strains emerged. Yep, I'd rather get 66% effective vaccine 95% effective vaccine 6 months. Potentially, wait weeks hopefully use bridge till get Pfizer Moderna, waiting till next week absolutely. economy people‚Äôs lives Press x ""Doubt"". Wait canada something worse USA? thought guys better us everything? Noooo. Also sis lives guys need hurry up.. think so, sadly. normal times, better available, wouldn't. pandemic times. economy.... nothing good leftist loves roast Joe Biden, twitter feed nothing since elected mean depends conditions. think I‚Äôm gonna get another vaccine months yes. possible could get vaccine month yes. main concern passing virus coworker parents high risk. would feel much confident seeing 95 percent 72 percent. want vaccine Dr Faucci got elected officials. expect us take Johnson Johnson vaccine isn‚Äôt proven tackle new variants? Seems like thee. wait around sick people often ? Nope. ‚Äúbuy vaccines, give states....profit‚Äù  approved vaccines two shot. J&amp;J readout one shot trial today, approved another couple weeks. Looks like vaccines also limiting spread well.

Really? widely cited? supposed thrilled get vaccine that‚Äôs 66% effective? I‚Äôm sorry I‚Äôm pretty disappointed. won‚Äôt make family feel safe around still, still leaves getting sick quarantine work completely table. ok get J&amp;J got first dose Moderna don‚Äôt access Moderna dose 2? I'm turning 18 May. Beating system...? Japan secured vaccines athletes. administering I've also (I'm young-ish woman) gotten creeped LOT less. Also 100% effective preventing death sounds kind nice Speak self hmm wonder kept rest year. Must ALIENS LIZARD PEOPLE 5G possibly people reducing contact never really used get much lived introvertly. pandemic made realize much missing on. think taking umbrage idea mandatory health screening seems like idea that‚Äôs good theory worthless practice. individual level, nobody going sign version gives bit better coin flip proper vaccination others virtual guarantees. short:

""We fucked up, UK didn't, want UK fix fuck expense lives UK citizens EU.""

Fuck them. Trump *literally plan*. Well live part US huge chunk people refusing wear masks can‚Äôt seem stay home one better tell do. Ugh! also believe point getting vaccine since still need wear mask, social distance, still get covid pass others. also say ‚ÄúOnly small number people die God wants die it, ok that.‚Äù 
I find exhausting keep trying change peoples minds. virus made realize fucking stupid people refuse read anything headline meme. Vitamins fuck Covid. Wear mask, stay inside, take vaccine it‚Äôs available you.

(Not taking vitamins bad advice general, it‚Äôs topic) I'm not. Bless volunteers took leap faith us. Thank goodness science. Can't wait get Fauci Ouchie. ‚ÄúI struggle exercise without losing breath‚Äù

Also them: ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt left apartment 10 months‚Äù Let Stafford out! underrated QB forreal. dont think even Fauci would say something like Biden certainly wouldnt endorse it. said masks forever. doubt feel guilt, claim god's bs. know definitely long Covid cases. Typically got ill ended hospital. 

But see lot stories kicking around people say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm anxious, feel aches, struggle exercise‚Äù. Yeah that‚Äôs lockdown, chief. Hopefully DoD assisting distribution administering put dent backlog! informative post thanks. count on. Cool, Canada borrow some? Promise pay back .. lost ""Well SHIT""..
Although love panic room.. Humanity best...again dont one. one forcing you. Yep... EU EU. Actually first 3 years get blame bad stuff previous admin. That's rule. may reason, explain Indiana, example. Hospitalizations decreasing peak two days Thanksgiving. spike holidays. time California pulled heads asses. come people saying vaccine preventing transmission virus cases going too? prevent transmissions, hospitalizations go cases stay same? less people bothering get tested guess show symptoms? mush put hamberders. makes sense jabbing elderly probably High risk group anyway Yep listening NPR LA County health director (i think?) talking debated reopening outdoor dining one reasons well, suspect least 33% LA county covid point who's gonna get already such..

oof...

anyways glad peak core, hospitals arent running risk failing Trump left office close million vaccinations day. Biden likely jack way setting federal vaccination sites buying doses. EU manage screw vaccination worse Trump? Except suffering? That's whole point.

The places well paid far, far heavier price.

You need vaccine urgently places. unfair, nearly unfair ""essential"" workers without proper healthcare US gotten sick died. even broach subject actually poor countries.

Not mention faster places actually massive outbreaks like US gets control, fewer, potentially vaccine-resistant variants be.

I'm *so* sorry Novavax J&amp;J good enough you. heart fucking bleeds. He'll say something different tomorrow. literally Trump's plan that's pace right now. Biden really changed anything it. way around bud.

The UK funded vaccine paid much higher price per dose EU. EU spend millions different ""European Vaccine"" failed, bitched contract signed, specifically gave much lower price understanding best effort clause. always knew second (or third) line.

Basically, thd EU played games fucked up, want UK tax payer fix it.

No thanks, EU pound sand. ""it take 18 months *MINIMUM* corona vaccine""

I know entirely reasonable prediction damn, nice people wrong Thank you! want correct Distributing vaccine evenly even make sense. better herd immunity places everywhere sitting like 10% vaccinated really anything stop spread. ü•∫ cryin FL rn lol ü•∫ don‚Äôt trust Ron DeathSentence worry vaccine passports we'll forced restrictions longer accommodate anti vaxxers. AZ also delivered 60% less promised UK Q4 2020, delays happening EU ordered 3 months later.

All major vaccine producers faced delays, 60% less, still. Moderna Pfizer too. nature rushed manufacturing.

EU also spent 7 times less per capita propping vaccines manufacturing Boris UK Trump US.

AZ mess reporting delays time. EU messed colossally ordering late, investing way less monitoring manufacturing AZ plants **even deliveries UK massively delayed 20202 Q4.**

When EU ever take responsibility never-ending long list inept actions instead trying shift blame? I'm supposed trust Bloomberg? Los Angeles aka cases city, barely see anybody mask unless it‚Äôs benefit like going store. Also indoor dining reopening b/c soon California sees slight decline, everything good. Even though LA reported 8,000 cases yesterday hell stop social pressure get vaccine? one would bit reluctant meet friends vaccine someone vulnerable relative, even vaccinated, they'd probably even so.

This sounds like massive sop anti vaxxers wording government advert advising get vaccine could count political political pressure. Gen pop vaccinations won‚Äôt while, we‚Äôll get plenty info vaccines Interesting. Thank information. Something contemplate. Studies articles COVID diabetes: teacher fully understand going virtual person learning. last year horrific mental strain every human planet. Full stop. 

That said, long term health effects going destroy lives barely begun. 

I personally know several women miscarried COVID. 

A friend nurse cardiologists office seen 10x number children year long term COVID effects hearts.  Eh, Novaflu almost certainly going new quad flu vaccine top-line efficacy numbers put March last year. COVID vaccine needs refrigerator temps. need hexapro-based vaccine really get shelf stable. gonna believe this...  Wait
I thought orange beast messed up? confused. next big opportunity mass stupidity spring break / Easter. Oh no, climate change probably get us first rate You‚Äôll smaller scale events require less planning risk. won‚Äôt like last summer though Lol there's big holidays Pfizer's trials partially take place South Africa, can't find information regarding proportion participants there. Important remember trials took place well first case South Africa variant documented mid-December. Moderna contract J&amp;J produce recipe? Lmfao much money parents have? imagine entitled.

EU orders late.

EU spends almost order magnitude less money per capita support manufacturing.

EU lies contractual obligations AZ.

EU starts trade war.

Perhaps instead calling war blame incompetent governments demand head office. ""The newest member XFL"" Thank God Constitutional. FYI people get tested sick (is they're hospital) people required tested work, that's it, positivity rates increase. NY gov spoke lot months ago. indicative widespread disease rather fewer tests overall, skewed towards sick. would gain lying it? would better admiting work buying vaccine work. vaccine garbage use it, country suffer China see certain places, example Disneyland, requiring vaccination entering park validation via name id check vaccination card. considered government control good health practice? vote good health practice lol No, guessing something normally would need tested trials administered general population. yeah, came back Manaus supposedly achieved herd immunity wish well decide risk alternative mean takes 52 days 2 doses vacined think that's pretty long wait. people get vaccine, pummel coronavirus.

The hospitization numbers way America April May, IMO. would still antibodies?

Not relevant.

The cross reactivity cells, antibodies. Translation: we'll say whatever shit makes stock go up. Brrrrrrr fly shot day keeps pence away Wait, original strain.... anything Two outnumbering.... 


&amp;#x200B;

WHA? funny all, long Covid real joke. 

I wish worst enemies. *visible confusion*

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs...why I‚Äôm here.‚Äù

Obi-Wan Moderna (or Pfizer/JJ) Ya gotta help ya help others, harsh truth Good get started Eurovision Song Contest 2 problems 1st- still spread 2nd- seeing increasing numbers young kids potentially lifelong issues. Increases autoimmune diseases like diabetes, MIS-C, permanent heart lung damage, brain/memory issues. really idea mean long term kids

2 problems, though.

1st - vaccines shown stop transmission. big problem

2nd- vaccines tested young kids lifelong issues completely unknown work tho Anything greater 1 would make true. Science (math actually)  52% quoted Pfizer first dose low includes first 12 days vaccine little effect. 2nd dose efficacy 89%. Obviously wide confidence intervals single week infections low sample size Yep, people SoCal think COVID spreads public places  Oh thank you, let‚Äôs add another 5 may obvious answer, mean caught covid back lets say September, could catch another variant COVID NOW? Maximum Derek pretty advanced case cancer 35 years ago, radiation treat it. Now, I‚Äôm heart problems likely due radiation treatments. regret getting radiation? Absolutely - gave 35 years would refused it. weigh risks take best option time. know least 3 people suffering long-haul effects covid vaccine risks well worth avoid months years decreased quality life, mention dying. permissible constitution. Pandemic not. numbers lead people seeking superior vaccines? Trump lying knew to
Do. could forget Mike Pence's classic ""there COVID second wave""? Thing is, turns EU messed trying draw away attention yet another colossal fuck up. Indonesia. Alright, that's doable. called contract.

The EU could pulled Trump negotiated vaccine exports local demands met. Instead spent year tarnishing Trump advocating solidarity cooperation.

Now, many countries already signed contracts EU companies paid money bankrolled establishment manufacturing within EU, EU looking steal doses said countries.

The EU spend 7 times less UK US per capita setting manufacturing, want exclusivity production financed people's money? met fellow ate fly yearly ""keep immune system strong."" kid not. Cool. Yesterday sub started getting flooded comments try push agenda deaths count nothing else important epidemic - view - end completely soon deaths end (when oldest vaccinated), need vaccinate young get herd immunity even. kind thinking dangerous desteuctive, could undermine vaccination efforts help new strains emerge escape vaccines.

They also dismiss long covid lung, organ damage despite numerous studies confirming it. create alternative reality covid like common cold, people die it.

I've noticed happening since J&amp;J published good data efficacy. even reported posts 66% title misleading claiming severe cases count (for J&amp;J around 85%). True like article stated numbers J&amp;J still really good, despite lower Pfizer Moderna. lot people want get one shot we'll find short time effective becomes widely available.  needed. Speak yourself. Again, care UK, supply chains ,etc. bought product.

Where it?

As completely unrelated matter - company size using lessons learnt one market apply other. Articles sub say asymptomatic cases cause permanent heart lung damage. miss them. First all, that's nonsensical maths. Secondly, trials run differently different times (Pfizer Moderna circulation new strains), even possible compare efficacy like like. likelihood gap much smaller people believe simply looking headlong 95% vs. 72%, even prevents hospitalizations deaths. I'm imagining Michigan right now. Whitmer great plan idiots flip it. never realized insane people state happened point also avoid mild fectionand end sprrad. spread continues new steains emerge vaccine/antivody evasion like South African strain.

Yesterday sub started getting flooded comments try push agenda deaths count nothing else important epidemic - view - end completely soon deaths end (when oldest vaccinated), need vaccinate young get herd immunity even. kind thinking dangerous desteuctive, could undermine vaccination efforts help new strains emerge escape vaccines.

I've noticed happening since J&amp;J published good data efficacy. even reported posts 66% title misleading claiming severe cases count (for J&amp;J around 85%). Compared scientists EMA though?

A self serving politician antivaxx country Europe last place would go medical advice.  Like many, I'm attracted one shot option end day I'm afforded choice one get I'd opt J&amp;J one reason. like vaccine bad work, know extent work long term effective mutations. turns we'll get another vaccination line stubborn variant it, provided remains free remains available all.   Yeah idea enough justify restrictions kind scenario expecting? Pfizer Moderna either - trials measured efficacy symptomatic infection, strains started spread reduced efficacy. gap likely much smaller think vaccines. Wrong. Mild cases get long covid too. That‚Äôs true. Florida exactly middle road, 11 states greater deaths per million real lock downs, 16 states fewer deaths per million real lock downs. 

That‚Äôs including virus first spread overwhelmed healthcare system level treatment knowledge existed fraudulent comparison (NY, CT, MA, NJ notably).

Not even touch accuracy reporting states, notably Florida, wildly different. Folks one side claimed NY falsely inflated deaths bad terrible thing, making mortality argument lock downs. Yeah we've heard go attack nursing home employees work directly vulnerable yet still reject vaccine. also like herd immunity hard limit either. Hopefully we're seeing gradual supression transmission here. Ah ignore front part sentence, vaccines tested multiple countries Water free: bottled water isn't.

I get sentiment agree, company probably pays tests, distribution machines employees on. paying convenience point. 'Ukraine' 'the [[BBC [[Reuters boop I‚Äôm bot) said anything full war? would allow Russia way Ukraine Belarus. would cause extreme instability Europe. Ya saw that! great news! I'm hoping he's promising. Sorry. difference huge. Biontech quite good results real life. thank J&amp;J reports, no. Better help Moddrba Biontech increase production HUNDREDS THOUSANDS FRONT LINE HEALTHCARE WORKERS OFFERED VACCINE FREE, DECLINED INDUBITABLY.

ONE REJECTED DOSES SKEPTICAL HEALTHCARE WORKER WENT PERRY, HOPEFULLY REDUCE BLACK VACCINE SKEPTICISM.

In months begging celebrities take vaccines reduce skepticism. Wait see many stupid Americans want it. ""thinking get covid twice"" yep expected nothing article im still let down

too much statistical anomaly suddenly care god help us all... point dealing pandemic properly right away, even would incur significant emotional costs (restrictions, lockdown, etc.) significant monetary costs (paying people stay home, etc.), much cheaper long run trying half-assedly ""manage"" pandemic. resulted to? lot misery stretched long time.  Yes is. it? Well damn, Fucci. Getting bold today huh? getting vaccine want covid.

He getting vaccine embolden skeptical black people get vaccine too.

Both true I'm glad makes mad. Stay home, spend grant money scholarships. Shutting borders tremendously effective. happened Ireland got rid original strain become infected place thanks new strains care thinks? 

Well, he's head state, words carry weight, plus he's usually responsible like Trump. always cover positive lights. says something TV that's false, hard blame ordinary guy believing him. Agreed, love see people taking advantage great places explore ton benefits spending time outdoors definitely encourage it. 

I‚Äôd lying though said didn‚Äôt enjoy trails sometimes met old lady swallowed fly... See kind shit ruins lives.

Consider it. 

Youre alive catch Covid.

It doesnt kill you, rest life becomes shitshow.

Ive already seen people whose lives turned way.....

Horror suffering yet people Argentina, Argentinian redditors, say wish president. Jesus. would rather J&amp;J vaccine that's 66% effective preventing COVID. sayin'. research yet peer reviewed could establish causal link organ impairment infection. Also, sharing land borders countries stop Vietnam Thailand handling COVID. Uh, people computers 2000 2010. talking like 1980s there. main difference 10-20 years ago probably much bullshit misinformation spread social media, might changed things went. Three nurses work twice. get twice. nurses work COVID (including three who've twice) getting vaccine. Yes, antibodies produced vaccine expected remain effective longer ignorant af? normal, permanent, major events ever take place world again, better accept June?

Shit.

Feels like 1999, bro outdoor dining allowed cal smoking dunce? UK barely even acknowledged vaccine trouble EU. completely unnecessary provocation. idea UK would arrange vaccinations shipped Belgium Ireland sneak border nonsense. action distract populations ECs collosal failings. Cool  Oh think replied wrong person. asked Bolsonaro related Russia, reply Cambridge Analytica thought said Cambridge Analytica Russian asset Honestly, Ive already gotten wise ‚ÄúCOVID Employers‚Äù bullshit games...

Always winds forced Ot.... mRNA beats variants, smart ass people know well. Maintenancecold, nearly Stephenson amazing.  One first snow crash awesome, diamond age, anathem, three book historical fiction series whole bunch scientists, economists, pirates nobles main characters awesome.  Seveneves quite good reamde insane. Reamde hackers, Russian mobsters, video game mmorpg sideplots, terrorists, bunch badasses trying figure everything out. cannot go wrong him.  EU paying low price due one biggest customers. also means least priority. USA Israel example paying way more. EMA MHRA approved age groups. would anyone care Macron thinks?

Why isn‚Äôt moaning Sanofi take huge amount money EU U.K. delivered absolutely nothing? Perhaps French? starting sound like ""we found cure cancer"" articles pandemic ends community infection limited, people die. vaccines immunity infections contribute that. effects latter already becoming obvious. that? shit together Context suggests statement refers long term respiratory complications. neuroimmune system distinct general immune system. Even lungs totally protected immune system, COVID19 seems able immediately gain foothold nerves within nose. nerves epithelial cells form short direct pathway brain, basically entire pathway would protected neuroimmune system.

The original comment still stands. Even major complications within respiratory system prevented, give us much indication effects Central Nervous System. COVID-19 seems somewhat like influenza, that, it‚Äôs going keep creating variants.

You probably mean SARS-CoV-2 variants, interesting think virus change enough also start seeing COVID-19 variants (disease different symptoms). severely misinterpreted situation, much like EU... üòÇ sure hope so. that's I'm concerned regarding virus. I've bronchitis past worry catch covid could number lungs short long term. We're almost finish line, hang everybody. actually know sure mrna vaccines less effective SA variant, speculation point? know, are, mean there's immunity provided or...? really confusing. Yep Dude wore TWo masks grocery store issues breathing. Dont make wear three ok? Cause better could've ever hoped. number released think Fauci said anything 60% he'd avdocate immediate use. You‚Äôll shocked know efficacy ur flu vaccine then, I‚Äôm taking one available can‚Äôt choosing beggars atm mean life lie??? :-) Poop. Fart. Poop again.... Yes. China gave Indonesia, 4th largest country world , bunch vaccines got scorn .

China's also giving tons PPE vaccines developing countries can't afford Pfizer Moderna.

But no, according US, China evil imperial empire dominate world, really projection themselves. keep positive attitude. Definitely hoping 2 shots. see ‚Äî us whose jobs aren‚Äôt ‚Äúessential‚Äù enough us deemed worthy quality vaccine, living podunk areas without freezers, going crap pushed us whole ‚ÄúYou got shot, shut go back normal.‚Äù knows. Brits known clever lies. Perfide Albion etc. Wait see. 

Why EU want them? invested 300 million it! Like duh. 

Glad see Brits finally woken NI, preceding 5 years almost like forgotten Ok bub, thanks üëç Ebola way easier deal with, stop spreading simply quarantining people symptoms letting anyone touch blood. would need lockdowns would handle Ebola way back then, would work. can't tell who's contagious spreads simply people room infected person; incredibly complicated prevent spreading comparison. That's required lockdowns, we're lucky mortality rate ended relatively low. addition comment, saw sources linked article [from New York mention amount immunity infection one individual another (they think might due amount virus someone exposed to, it‚Äôs still researched). thing vaccines amount given resulting immunity consistent. article, also doctors talking vaccines could beneficial already covid - like it‚Äôs booster shot - would wait amount time initial infection/recovery (90 days time period). room both. I‚Äôm worried ‚Äúonce get control‚Äù part. It‚Äôs really hard get everyone wear masks, it‚Äôs really hard get everyone take vaccine. people refuse accept science continue slow even stop efforts contain this. mean whole nations either can‚Äôt get vaccine people don‚Äôt trust won‚Äôt get it. places remain breeding grounds (as certain clusters country). underestimate role corrupt anti-science government played Manaus reaching level dismay, virus strain mutability alone I'm sure mocking long term effects science regards matter. I‚Äôve wondered too. Like figure you‚Äôre 5 percent still risk antibody test. Wouldn‚Äôt improve efficacy. know adding third step would complicate it, couldn‚Äôt folks opt get antibody test fail seek assistance least continue full protective steps. understood - understand basics. 

Novamax terrible, check report. 

Vector adenovirus can‚Äôt redacted. get immunity vector. forever

Chinese vaccine bad reports press, check sub. 

Russian vaccine finished 3rd Phase, check reports Russia sub. US probably one mankind's selfish asshole super power society.

That's need 40 trillion dollar military , deploy around world assholes smaller countries. Make sure give weeks system thing post vaccination. far tell get fully vaccinated able resume life pre pandemic, new variants knows could happen? far sounds like current vaccines available become available effective mutations. sure hope so. bold strategy Cotton, lets see works him. Except that‚Äôs almost useless strategy pandemic.

And already know Americans come pouring sick.

El centro CA El Paso TX showed oh well. all. Pretty certain if.

China's shat hard reddit US media , wonder still manage stay bullshit well they've done.

The anti china rhetoric west probably worse anti soviet rhetoric Reagan. Every country isolated island there's travel bans. lack masks people still gathering screwed everyone else. Nobody remembers Germany refusing allow 3 masks country despite US paid them?  You‚Äôve reading seveneves would guess. Great book. already outnumber it.

The D614G variant we've West since February 2020 contagious mutation virus hit China. original Wuhan virus almost certainly outnumbered worldwide D614G March. children?  bad governor DeSantis, everything loyal Trump puppy go Biden even means residents die, plus wants profit donations pharmacies like Publix Yearly booster shots needed likely. people seem realise BMI 25 pits risk dying covid least needing ICU. 

This poor guy looks like BMI 25.  Covid conf today Andy slavitt said marching orders many possible. 1M floor intention everyone vaccinated yesterday. seeing doctor twice 17 years make healthy Absolutely - get contact PCP gets worse. Thanks miss concert festivals!!! Let‚Äôs go! Agreed. mean 66% work boss would hand ass plate! vaccine going leave 34% chance still get disease makes miss weeks work struggle damaged organs, THANKS. I‚Äôll wait little longer real vaccine. prefer one that‚Äôs drastically less effective? Fascinating.  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs good, really!‚Äù

Let guess one rich people, politicians, kids taking? Anything Moderna/Pfizer rot shelves US.  No. people don‚Äôt want Johnson Johnson vaccine it‚Äôs effective enough. know won‚Äôt getting one.  Pfizer Moderna currently shipping EU AstraZeneca shipping EU. problem UK's vaccine production seems contract forbids provide anyone vaccines US basically banned vaccine exports.

Now AstraZeneca said provide majority doses agreed provide several month EU decided introduce regulation guarantees foul play guarantee foul play vaccine exports would affected. 37-year-old healthy man, seen doctor twice last 17 years, died contracting coronavirus. It‚Äôs good time remember previous administration‚Äôs first reaction confiscate PPE get cut action. history allergies mean any. means exposed thing reaction to, concentrated exposure. Speaking Californian, lockdown? I‚Äôve working exposed Covid since June, several scares. It‚Äôs business usual here. :\ expect vaccinated next Fall.

Has CDC issued mask-wearing guidelines people already recovered COVID already vaccinated? [you really can‚Äôt get trump mouth sad opposite preach. Rural areas last, like always. stay lockdown mode(partially) One possible version many deals could made.

Mederna teaches Canadian firm produce vaccine. Canadian firm pays Mederna royalty $1 every dose Canadian firm produces. question, know much science vaccine's read Pfizer's CEO claiming ""huge possiblity future variants eluding vaccine's"". mean may wait another year vaccine people vaccinated might go vaccination process again? worry time us low risk folks get it, vaccine effective anymore. you‚Äôre 65+ year old frontline worker don‚Äôt choice üòâ lol It‚Äôs Orban. So: no. Dude‚Äòs simply idiot. They're largely produced locally. I'll take two doses moderna, Pfizer, J&amp;J. 

J&amp;J vaccine also work better second booster shot. time supply exists booster shot, two dose study releasing results. going take benadryl. saw somewhere even 60% take vaccine see dramatic decrease cases. So, im still hopeful 70% willing .. so?

China seeing issue U.S. embargo chips. saw embargo's [on 'S. Korea lift restrictions face mask exports Fri'). now, vaccines.          
The lesson learned is, critical material needs made sovereign soil. damned sure China has, top national priority, chip making capability makes immune U.S. export controls (sanctions).

If country vaccine producing capability, better reliable source obtain imports from. Europe indicating they're out.  Sinovac?  Sputnik? Sure did. read this. enough, did. Google ""trump claiming vaccine causes loss trust"". Sure going exactly point, beat around bush. fun googling. care anymore. Shh.

We really downplay flu, hopefully stop this. That's makes Covid bad, *not flu* flu horrible actual flu. Masks taken meaning own, strongly political, less so, ""mask wearers"" outspoken vigilant it. takes significance people think saving planet feeding orphans. People get shouting matches it, gotten dirty looks people outdoors 50 feet away wearing them.

But somehow recommendations largely lost. see people stores wearing mask touching everything including doors bare hands standing close one another, mask magically protect them. people wear ""chin diaper"" pretend like they're complying. quite bizarre. Hang friend. will. Save Protect Baby Mink, they're cute. Federal vaccination centers vaccinate 200 6000 people day design-phase currently.  You‚Äôve essentially told people see anyone outside home anything essential activities.

It‚Äôs ‚Äúasking people nicely‚Äù  One virus eradicated history, took 400+ years inoculation vaccination make happen. 

Zero covid realistic. Frankly even was, resources needed eradicate would better spent eradicating tuberculosis (1.5 million deaths every year) malaria (400K deaths every year, mostly children), finally knocking polio we're it. Even get two supposed loosen up.

They test could spread it, getting sick vaccines effect yes. not, plan B. People told - always do. comparing apples apples vaccine efficacy vs. reinfection rate among health care workers?

Keep looking though. It‚Äôs interesting see already know virus, keep mind year much better data. take three months, absurd think it. Yeah. Brazil enjoying life, restaurants open things mostly normal. Meanwhile countries ""doing everything right"" stuck endless cycle lockdowns restrictions. add on, even mutate evade vaccine, change vaccines accordingly.

There people fine Biden's goal 100M shots 100 days, *are already that* goal would get 1/7 U.S. population. never acceptable goal. also ever fine 30% distribution slow ramp states holding back 100% second doses (despite knowing production ramping up) trouble locating vaccinating people highest priority groups.

There's legit risk-benefit assessment medical science needs make pre-teens younger, risk side effects vaccine may exceed risk posed covid, particularly community transmission knocked adult vaccination. suspect summer life pretty open US, one exception masks still around least big cities.

Even right now, outside California, NY, Massachusetts, none mandates enforced exception mask rules northern part country. south, many states bordering pre-pandemic lifestyle.

Viral sequencing‚Äîproducing kind bar code virus‚Äîhas recent months emerged crucial global hunt versions pathogen better adapted infect humans, evade vaccines possibly kill. Virus variants first identified U.K., South Africa Brazil provoked concern among experts.

The variant sequencers uncovered U.K., dominant variety country, mutation appears better able bind onto human cells. Studies suggest 50% transmissible previous prevalent variant research suggests could be¬†[at least 30% viral variants likely spotted U.K. anywhere else. Jan. 29, U.K. submitted 44%, around 190,000, genomes held global library run nonprofit Global Initiative Sharing Influenza Data, Gisaid. around 5.1% nearly four million cases detected U.K.

The U.S. fast increasing sequencing capabilities‚Äîbut handful countries contributed 1% library, means scientists‚Äô understanding virus mutating patchy.

That represents weakness the¬†[global response Speedy detection new variants allows governments adjust restrictions limit travel countries new troublesome variants prevalent. also help vaccine developers update vaccines.

The U.K. says plans address weakness exporting expertise countries limited sequencing capabilities.

Half the¬†genome¬†sequences U.K. generated Wellcome Sanger Institute, facility Cambridgeshire stores, sorts, samples sequences genomes byproducts positive Covid-19 tests five large laboratories around U.K.

The U.S. increased contribution global coronavirus¬†genome¬†database since December far added 20% total. assessed 0.3% America‚Äôs Covid-19 cases.

Anthony Fauci, President Biden‚Äôs chief medical adviser Covid-19 pandemic, said CBS Sunday U.S. authorities need expand genomic surveillance identify variants virus.

Britain‚Äôs capabilities partly built upon history.¬†[British scientists discovered DNA double part international team first sequenced human¬†genome.

‚ÄúThe U.K. one first countries world recognize need infrastructure viral genomic sequencing we‚Äôve backed huge investment long Covid emerged,‚Äù Health Secretary Matt Hancock said speech Tuesday.

The country‚Äôs data-rich, state-run National Health Service also closely linked extensive network researchers universities pharmaceutical industry.

Nonetheless, U.K.‚Äôs large-scale sequencing coronavirus almost didn‚Äôt get ground.

On March 4, U.K. four known cases Covid-19, microbiologist Sharon Peacock got phone group scientists agreed sequencing virus‚Äôs¬†genome¬†to monitor mutations would vital track spread country identify source outbreaks.

They met opposition. scientists thought large-scale¬†genome¬†sequencing virus mutates slowly others, influenza, would futile.

‚ÄúAt time, people saying wouldn‚Äôt enough mutational difference make worthwhile,‚Äù said Dr. Peacock, director Covid-19 Genomics U.K., network established trace coronavirus‚Äôs family tree.

On March 11, day World Health Organization declared global pandemic, Dr. Peacock held meeting London Wellcome Trust 19 others, including clinical virologists, technologists, experts human¬†genome¬†sequencing vaccinologists, thrash plan large-scale sequencing coronavirus.

‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt like standard scientific meeting, huge debate could this,‚Äù recalled Dr. Peacock. end day blueprint submitted England‚Äôs chief scientific officer March 18. accepted 20 million pounds, equivalent $27 million, government funding awarded April 1 set COG-UK.

‚ÄúThis pace perfection that‚Äôs case ever since, I‚Äôm delighted consortium 600 people contribute understanding disease,‚Äù added.

Yet country‚Äôs success variant discovery appears due serendipity strategy.

The scale U.K.‚Äôs genomic sequencing output‚Äîthat assessed 10% positive coronavirus tests U.K. points pandemic‚Äîwas intended identify superspreader events identical sequences, closely related predecessors, emerge time.

When RNA virus like one causes Covid-19 replicates inside new host, mistakes made genetic code. don‚Äôt matter, proofread corrected sometimes mistakes made all. errors, mutations, large number important changing virus affect biology, rare cases giving advantage predecessors.

Coronaviruses mutate slowly viruses influenza, initially scientists didn‚Äôt think would enough mutations make large-scale genomic sequencing worthwhile.

But virus infected many people‚Äîover 100 million world-wide far‚Äîit many opportunities mutate. changes, including one U.K. variant reported present least 64 countries, confer evolutionary advantages forebears make version virus transmissible.

The new variant came experts‚Äô attention November, version large number significant changes predecessor began accumulate corner southeast England, creating outcrop identical genomes flashed red genomists‚Äô screens.

Initially, sequencers didn‚Äôt know whether variant gaining prominence widespread flouting coronavirus restrictions whether cause flare-up new cases, Jeffrey Barrett, director Covid-19 Genomics Initiative Wellcome Sanger Institute, said online seminar month.

By final week November, becoming clear exactly spot mutant genomes congregating, Covid-19 cases accelerating community despite compliance national lockdown.

Trawling back the¬†genome¬†databases, sequencers found first occurrence heavily mutated variant Sept. 20 Kent, southeast England, another day later London. Geographical matching cases genomes enabled virus detectives say high degree certainty correlation wasn‚Äôt coincidence designated virus one concern. First off, 66% effectiveness. importantly, 100% effective hospitalization death. 100% good enough odds everyone. Period. Austria tested found 1.2%, like many European countries.

Link? can't find source this. essential workers go work, others work home take unemployment. shops, restaurants, bars etc closed. Schools closed.

So already there! thanks asking. bullshit? Nobody test group died... that's 100%. mean nobody ever die. study vaccines tested. logic almost every national leader resign given bad handling pandemic (looking you, Canada, Member States EU, Brazil, Mexico, China, South Africa, Argentina etcetera). personally think someone like Michel Barnier would better President Commission, vote confidence Commission matter European Parliament end. investigate EU's response pandemic whole action taken conclusions. now, Commission acted somewhat mitigate damage. Let's hope uninterrupted vaccine flow prevent situations arising coming months. leave. won‚Äôt miss you. Daddy DeSantis sure hell won‚Äôt either! So, we're back fortnight ago, vaccines coming UK planned.

What calamitous state affairs EU. complete PR failure resulted changes UK's scheduled vaccines, shown disorganised petty be.

Putting GFA table incredibly dangerous act.

Even Barnier told reel in. 

That woman needs go. Hm 6 million doses march. know thats 4 weeks right? we've received 1 million now? 5 million march. 1.25 million per week.
Not happening. Planes? Trains? automobiles? mean, technically right one going wear mask inside home unless they've got confirmed exposure symptomatic household member (at point may already late)/ Getting redundant vaccines much hurt you. want tested antibodies first. Federal Government jurisdiction in-state travel? know E484 mutation apparently affects people differently. Meaning neutralize RBD (receptor binding domain) others cannot. That‚Äôs efficacy vaccines place. 

Further, mutation may indicate level differences antibody titers longitudinally. Meaning may high levels day 18 others may low levels day 18. roles may switch, high levels day 18 low levels day 90, other.

 fascinating also extremely scary. Basically, need research find better vaccine. every one person. believe Zero COVID means full elimination virus worldwide (i.e. zero cases COVID anywhere) via NPI suppression. Otherwise like Australia New Zealand do, forever, quarantine every international traveler 14 days, test everyone time, etc. do, another Melbourne incident always right around corner. Someone sneaks quarantine entire city strict lockdown 3 months. 66% get virus all. rest get mild symptoms. means would reduce transmission lot since 66% wouldn‚Äôt get thus wouldn‚Äôt pass on. remaining 34% would mostly get cold like symptoms even would reduced lot since virus would much less prevalent. J&amp;J vaccine would fine. Ya get guess. It‚Äôs tough moral question though young healthy people getting sick dying (albeit lower rates). üò∑ü§¢üíâüå°ü¶†‚ò†Ô∏èüòµ get join hidden illness/disability club. Spend rest lives legitimate illness dismissed told ""But, LOOK ok!!!"" Around people starting get them. Mostly starting risk folks, old folks. grandpa appointment. ‚ÄúAt point, evidence variants changed equation terms protection vaccine,‚Äù said Dr. Michael Osterholm


Doom porn.

The article full unknowns. Sure possible worse case scenario, that's unlikely. conduct new trials booster since designed first one two days, I'm confident pivot quickly. ""if convicted, could serve 6 months jail""

They convicted go jail. That's legal speak. judge prosecutor make example case quadruple sentence, fine like 20% net worth, mandatory civil/public service every weekend 5 years probation fact. 

If pothead get pulled jailed fucking weed, catch charge grams pipe, judge throw book selfish, greedy, disgusting humans can't believe share earth with. 65% effective isn‚Äôt prizer vaccines better? big news? it‚Äôs one shot easy storage? haven‚Äôt done research hopefully someone educate me. good news considering recent EU's nationalist vaccine trade war protectionism  know there‚Äôs way enforce all, really think CDC urge people begin wearing masks home. majority people catching coronavirus point. also virus mutating: home. biggest vulnerability even paranoid covid preppers taking masks breathing freely home.

If CDC urged (it‚Äôs mandate) people wear masks time including home, rate community spread would drop. Even 20-30% people followed advice, would still drop numbers save lives. Also numbers drop noticeable degree, it‚Äôd catch would begin it.

It‚Äôs frustrating thing world know spreads know 100% shut spread can‚Äôt humans. traded rights temporary safety.

Some say lucky forced make trade-off.

Personally, disagree. Canada definitely better keeping covid case numbers low testing half much US. pretty sure cronies get vaccinated toss surplus. birthday 10 April hope they‚Äôre gone then. live UK given well vaccinations going fine open without masks. obstacle super incompetent leadership fearmongering SAGE. hope public scraps masks current plan 50s done April June anyone else wants it. here, KY.

No one second doses yet.  Germany appears prohibiting pregnant women vaccinated, Israel appears prioritizing it.

If pregnant, think would go first jab hold second, apparently lot likely cause widespread immune response. Correct. lot bases covered slowest runners far. get multiple vaccines? Like J&amp;J available sooner, could get that, get effective ones later they‚Äôre available? Thanks true genocide would taking measures Australia New Zealand 

Huh. know ""genocide"" meant ""high quality life long life expectancy"". can‚Äôt test antibodies? No. 

Well, yes. wife's grandmother eligible get one holding johnson johnson one one shot less likely get reaction.

Haven't spoken since news efficacy came out, people hold one reason another. Yah. didn‚Äôt real base go initially sunk money establish vendors paid off. didn‚Äôt get doses yet.  wonder, since cgy company building factory, building ASAP , could license one mRNA vaccines build there. So, understand it, reason governors getting heat because, least NY case, specifically built field hospitals handle stuff like this, use instead sent patients back nursing homes. 

Normally nursing homes supposed equipped isolation areas get used contagious outbreaks things serious elderly people like influenza. Many nursing homes either equipped properly handle pathogen like covid much contagious influenza. resulted nursing homes trying get assistance state, denied because...you know, hospitals completely shit. 

In normal cases hospitals flooded, patients would typically held cared hospital duration illness (if severe enough require hospitalization). Lol username Curious... found vaccinated, would (and trial participants got placebo) offered actual vaccine consolation? would end line everyone else? state local governments shit together actually get vaccines people's arms? üßê I'm concerned same. I'm happy every working vaccine let eventual sars-cov2 particles body unrestricted party 2-3 weeks immunity starts build  know majority people spouting didn‚Äôt actually mean it, wanted feel morally superior internet. talking about? Pzfier/Moderna need shots 95% efficacy. One shot provides low margin 52%. advised patients receive one shot. According Pfizer data published December 2020, Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine roughly 52% effective first dose. 36,523 participants phase three trial ‚Äì final stage testing people either received two full doses, 21 days apart, placebo ‚Äì evidence existing infection, 82 people placebo group 39 vaccine group developed Covid-19 Preclinical trials would shown think enough immunity one shot. However, early protection comes important caveats. First, protection kick least day 12 ‚Äì then, difference two groups. Secondly, one dose still significantly less protective two. latter 95% effective preventing disease link posted research paper discussing drawing comparison NovaVax Pfizer/Moderna similar yields old/Uk/SA. 

You see many replies above, get attempt discredit me. useful comparison? don‚Äôt think got downvoted referenced elderly fucking dinosaurs? Really?

IMO vaccine better COVID 19 99% vaccine. Amid contagious variants supply chain finally getting less crazy, decided good time phase homemade cloth mask favor KN95s. 

So long / many times use one these? see medical journal articles N95 effectiveness reduced two days, hospital workers 8-12 hour shifts around sick people.

It makes sense, anybody shred common sense would understand. Canada could production didn‚Äôt support Chinese companies ended screwing over.

All known well advance Canada- U.S. honest contracts. EU trying change rules fact, way different. No, slight chance reinfection. good news withheld vaccines although may 65% effective completely preventing variants provide 100% protection serious fatal COVID-19 Canada ready vaccinate everyone province 2 months yet vaccines supplies coming in. 2 million per day would population done 10 days Vince kids can‚Äôt get yet. like 3 4 Ministers Health quit??? EU started war. 100% absolutely. 

Other countries ordered early invested way manufacturing meet demand.

incompetent EU fumbled sign deals much later invested 7 times less UK US manufacturing.

UK US, signed early invested much, included clauses bunch manufacturing said plants go first domestic demand.

The EU, signed late invested less, not. Instead condemned Trump nationalism.

Other countries, saw EU stance ordered plants within EU countries relied supplies EU, instead working deals manufacturing elsewhere.

Now EU literally steals allotment countries signed earlier invested manufacturing EU, making 180 previous stance, also proving supreme incompetent hypocrites.

The solution? EU fuck ordering late investing little honoring agreements.

Also can't vote charge, never really bothered before, whole incident - especially happened border Ireland - really highlighted weakness potential problems that. problem also number people yet infected, defense yet, addition rather high infection rates covid19 versions.
Infection rate much higher vaccination rate.

Also, question:.
As far know, influenza jump species.
And covid19 jumps quite allot species, live around people.
Especially rural areas.
For infection rate, read figures doesnt add much infection rate. Negligable.
But expect matters allot considering mutation.
The potential succesfull (dangerous) mutations, seems logically, significantly larger factoring covid19's ability, infect cross-species. true? don‚Äôt expect Chinese vaccines effective advanced let‚Äôs say Pfizer Moderna. saying completely useless pretty ignorant.

I mean certain number countries already bought them. aren‚Äôt stupid buy garbage. That‚Äôs saying. least me, lol.

My point is, going immunize 100% population, efficacy number 67% great job alone R0 = 3, assuming prevents transmission. Even block completely, still reduces chance severe illness, main problem. don‚Äôt know much transmission reduction get vaccines yet, masks social distancing make R = 1.5, that‚Äôs much easier manage. Even Britain, despite new SARS-Cov-2 variant, R = 1 now. Sure, rather strict lockdown moment, works. 

mRNA set high standard, mean 67% bad result. Hecc, developers vaccines estimated get 60-70% first place, never knew they‚Äôll exceed number. going jab everyone single shot J&amp;J. 
NZ Pfizer, efficient enough. NZ also enough J&amp;J homologous prime-boost method it. single shot emergency measure case guys face outbreak. You‚Äôll Astra well, even heterologous option. That‚Äôs lot vaccines work with. 

Don‚Äôt know much NoraVax, Russia kinda sorta similar vaccine it, it‚Äôs subunit too, publications it, unfortunately. Probably used boost immunity later on. 

And no, US Europe ‚Äúhoard‚Äù vaccines. Nobody stashes here, used immediately available. case don‚Äôt know, outbreaks place.

This makes much sense, double booster shots way apart 2 weeks? Ok, vaccines supplied private companies.

We could banned exports like US did, Pfizer/BioNTech choice produce exclusively EU plants EU allowed deliver vaccines Canada, Israel, Mexiko, Singapur, UK, ... like right now.

76% vaccine manufacturing capacities world EU. enforce make exclusive contracts like US does. ""supplying"" states letting happen vaccines manufactored EU getting exported countries.

I sure US enough vaccines big newspaper articles US good boy giving away vaccines countries. Instead lower export restrictions. know polio vaccination actually help people gunpoint vaccinate pretty fucked part history also interesting
Edit 
I might confusing polio smallpox though Yeah agree others here.

UK invested I'm vaccines research supply lines set manufacturing last February signed contract **guaranteeing 100 million vaccines supplied UK plants could used fulfill contracts may many signed nations.**

and essentially would call vaccine war. see, Pfizer set plants EU one started produce deliver AZ, EU demand case shortfall EU would get doses first cuts spread equally among Pfizer's customers. EU set contract companies deliver customers EU plants even means EU deliveries cut long cut equally among customers. eu chose wait negotiate longer signing anything signed end August started work supply chains manufacturing. 

If longer negotiations would've reason delays AstraZeneca known quite some?

China, vaccine offered local firm BioKangtai, reserve enough capacity make least 100 million doses end Plenty countries Asia middle East already started using it. reason Bahrain UAE way higher vaccination rate vs EU. Considering trials found 79 86% effective, lower bound confidence interval Moderna Pfizer vaccines 89 90%, upper bound Sinopharm results likely crosses meaning there's statistical difference them. safe say viruses generally provide immunity strain life one infected? always thought case flu ironically every year new strain. same? None. ever equivalent trials flu vaccine etc. think what's happening circumstances changed i.e. covid mutations.

Its matter current known high risks (highly infectious pretty serious/ deadly) Covid outweighing unknown likely low risks vaccine pregnant women.

As pregnant woman im leaning towards getting reason. Covid including UK strain currently rampant live. viruses find way survive, shocker, right? likely get hit car next time go get sEvErE pErMaNeNt DaMaGe asymptomatic lol thing risks everything, important thing consider risks either something. Yes vaccines side effects wrong people (immuno compromised instance) even dangerous viruses sickness dangerous too. understand difficult situation honestly horrible people put situation make decision two risks. 

Honestly even seem extreme opinion even dont agree it. going things mention help contain spread good starting point. ok afraid lot information seems (or even is) contradicting other. 

Let's look forward though future without horrible virus effects. make this, we've done we'll again. 

This virus beat us!  Yup. lot confusion there. people see ‚Äú66% effective‚Äù seeing:

-100% effective death
-85% effective sever symptoms
-77% effective US
-single dose
-stable normal refrigeration 

Also important note almost one trial took vax even hospitalized. 

This game changer.  definitely circlejerking tendency amongst doom gloom crowd sub. heard tell it, thing basically black death borne anew.

A *healthy dose* concern warranted. sub endless barrage panic hysteria, starting become reasonable.  MN good outcomes covid wtf smoking.   Shortness breath fatigue. fact, fatigue mentioned article symptom *heart attack*.

As someone long-COVID married someone PTSD, assure conditions completely different. Stop pretending like know me. shit 60 year old woman says ‚Äúwell it‚Äôs gods plan.‚Äù 

Biblically speaking, God's plan send plague you, screwed pretty badly need smarten up. One study 551 American adults found quarter lied social physical distancing practices, among contracted Covid-19, 34% reported denied symptoms asked others.

That's key ""hard"" control, keeps destroying lives economies. I‚Äôm curious, open question anyone, getting JNJ vaccine, COVID prevention measures would continue follow?

If got them, think would still continue wear masks, eat home/order contactless take out, socially distant. measures I‚Äôd continue don‚Äôt remember top head. think Pfizer Moderna, I‚Äôd actually consider loosening little bit, I‚Äôm sure yet when. Obviously partying day after, could see taking day trip somewhere August based current projections Sure, let's open everything ten times many infections per day. problem long nobody dies!

I feeling way way way people tested already nearly deadly everyone thinks. someone make interactive timeline EU / AZ dispute please? See - would great (non cooperating, different mini-websites):

* timeline EU's point view
* timeline Astra Zeneca point view Rent free Every country, including EU, use vaccine available.

All approved vaccines effective matter administer fast possible - goverment pass vaccine available one might delivered 2 month. problem want go vacation dread feeling places like ""Oh, let country crappy J&amp;J vaccine, 66%! Moderna Pfizer only!"" J&amp;J vaccine users like second class citizens. I'd always criticise ""brinkmanship"" would fucking great  21 individuals, 17 (81%) documented history allergies""

It would good know many total 'documented history allergies'. least idea rate risk group.  Good see finally said. practical purposes pandemic measures need end people stop dying large numbers overwhelming hospitals .  stage really become another flu. Something accept minor risk lurking background.

It would crazy continue restrictions desire completely eliminate virus. would like using nuclear weapon hunt unicorn.  not...? 79 86% (depending trial) effective means confidence intervals likely overlap moderna Pfizer trials. E.g lower bound Pfizer trial 90% believe, means statistical significance Sinopharm upper bound CI higher. mention different trial protocols mean can't conclude one vaccine better results close. far better idea vaccinate vulnerable groups ASAP anything effective soon possible get deaths hospitalizations control whole point lockdowns. Come on. Lets keep ball rolling. Die, global aviation, die.  took sweet time, 400,000 Americans dead. r/rareinsults Could? Lmao much politician medical professional wish Reddit would stop worshipping ground walks on. Yeah, that's partially i'm thinking. interesting see hospitalizations continue fall quickly roll vaccine risk. 100% going select -- leave try give J&amp;J one, reschedule somewhere else.

75% may great world overall, 6 7 high-risk categories severe disease, going insist Pfizer Moderna vaccine myself.

Part problem sudden European travel ban was. Lots places travel bans special flights embassy get everyone home time. Since US coordinate strategy option people US. know several Europeans US time real struggle catch flight impossible so. people spend 2 days airport Canada several hundred dollars damages equipment due chaotic departure (the plane Canada Europe got cancelled short notice). 

Also Europeans banned UK numbers UK worse Europe (ecxept Spain Italy)? Yeah, fishy playing favourites all. 

There also need call ""Chinavirus"" already attacks Chinese looking people.

Oh wait........ What? 66% efficacy? GTFO. Give good Pfizer Moderna vaccine. Technically least 4 million hundred thousand, yes. calling deliberate downplaying, not? No. Canada ordered, entered contracts, rec‚Äôd commitments enough give everyone 6 doses. surplus would provide countries dire need.

Twice now, suppliers significantly pulled back delivery commitments Canada, government ‚Äúvery concerned‚Äù.

I‚Äôve seen episode before, wonder group heading shipments leave like PPE... I'm sure managed ""handle"" *utmost* respect human rights, like China did. And, people infected live guilt

I know people described suffered loss loved one it.

I‚Äôm convinced doctors guided towards virology failed psych rotation. saying things like sad excuse one problems. leads idea vaccine useless, key fighting virus. produced much higher volumes, stored regular refrigeration temperatures. That's huge.

I live tropical country storage subzero temperatures would expensive. call ""sorry excuse"" could key country defeating virus. ""sorry excuse"" *will* save millions lives applied. Pfizer vaccine protect South African variant? She‚Äôs girlfriend. I‚Äôd bet already it. Yeah, think great. Pfizer announced results, would thrilled vaccine works all. I'm still happy numbers. completely wrong. 

The Pfizer vaccine 'EUs'. belong EU. bought paid UK. UK ahead vaccinations bought paid vaccines astra zeneca Pfizer way ahead EU. UK taken doses EU. Pfizer doses UK paid produced Europe sent UK. Pfizer doses manufactured Europe make EU property. doses manufactured UK also bought paid UK. 

The funding part messy, idea think EU funded astra zeneca vaccine. UK actually provided funding astra zeneca vaccine EU. even getting information from? even first time numerous new sites done similar since started, get publisher editor whoever else involved pick it..

We started get latter recently result rigorous testing volunteers vaccine trials where, suspect, tested result vaccine actually sequenced samples test subject regular basis. That's explanation recent news J&amp;J said vaccine 85% effective general, performs worse South African strain. Yes. 

Natural immunity expected decrease effectively non-existent near 12 months out. Aside reducing risk getting sick, vaccination also reduce ability transmit others exposed (reduced transmission potential carrier). 

We coming year pandemic, means rolling loss natural immunity fight vaccination. can't think reason believe every, single, word comes Kremlin. Every last, single, stinking one god damned specimen honesty integrity always is. Mask upon you, brother.

Seems moral, indeed. interesting observation. One would align number EU politicians making baseless claims lack effectiveness 65s, also desperately tried make dispute AZ ( private company) EU-UK issue.

However, think unlikely help EU much consider number doses talking about. EU UK size maybe 2 million week manufacturing UK would little help EU. Vaccinating ~70 million UK different task vaccinating ~450 million EU. Whilst EU putting big focus doses UK, little change situation. 1 6,600 0.015% you‚Äôre nearly order magnitude anyway. 0.002% 0.015% 2 15. Right, given that, would want give people vaccine considerably less effective didn‚Äôt need to. [Ars Technical J&amp;J came preventing moderate severe COVID-19, analysis suggested vaccine's efficacy 72 percent United States, 66 percent Latin America, 57 percent South Africa, 28 days vaccination way EU handling awful.  jesus, why? probably worse bolsonaro operates modicum competency don‚Äôt want 66% effective vaccine two others 90%. I‚Äôll stay home wait.  Fucking yikes...we still long term data vaccines last. really sounds like even immunity via vaccines might less year.

Which begs question, that's case there's much constant mutation fading protection really answer. neverending semi shut replaced vaccination bi annually etc. glad country didnt even fucking try prevent spread getting vaccines first. vaccinate kids flu . . . ""Later Saturday, team went exhibition center features exhibit commemorating early efforts battle outbreak Wuhan, included 76-day lockdown city 11 million.'  Curious! Although numbers aren‚Äôt necessarily wrong, misleading lay people. problem 11-12 month data, doesn‚Äôt exist yet. IgG t0.5 suggests would expect natural immunity certainly last 5 months, reliably beyond 11-12 months. actually knew quite ago multi shot schedule would likely necessary. I‚Äôm assuming would include people refuse vaccine too. likely able vaccinated much sooner even risk really scary. tested kids yet. take extra precautions extra careful child testing. Children's immune systems bodies tiny adults, immune responses different. 80.2 original strain, 70.2% UK, it‚Äôs thought 6.5-8.5 fold drop SA. However, growing evidence E484 mutation may affect people differently. Meaning may able neutralize not, well antibodies levels could low 18 days high 90 days vice versa. That‚Äôs vaccine efficacies place vaccines right now. Another key finding extensive person-to-person variation mutations affect serum antibody binding neutralization. instance, neutralizing activity several samples reduced single mutations site E484, samples essentially unaffected E484 mutations. Similarly, mutations sites 443‚Äì450 loop (e.g., G446V) caused large drop serum antibody binding neutralization samples, little effect on-others. inter-individual heterogeneity compounded fact effects mutations sometimes changed time samples longitudinally collected individual. temporal changes could due disproportionate decay one dominant antibody clonotype, relative increase antibodies targeting epitopes. good bad don‚Äôt really know factors individual differences. either way protection that‚Äôs better nothing! Received second vaccine almost 24 hours ago. Definitely got slight headache arm sore injection site course overall feel fine.

I received 2 doses Pfizer vaccine. Yes, Im aware. suggest reading article EU‚Äôs recent moves specific words whether it‚Äôll affect Canada‚Äôs Pfizer supply. Sure 340 million people vaccines two shots...

Simple math here. Even doubled supply 6 months full vaccination.

And jj vaccine sucks compared Astra Pfizer. Yep still taking Uh, Trump's fault? We're getting vaccine promised. vaccine excuse can't vaccinate people?

Because getting *shafted* Pfizer Moderna. Yeah, like wealthiest nations human history possibly afford strengthen safety net make quarantines effective.  Nothing confirms people get likely asymptomatic That‚Äôs bought 900 million doses  left house ten months. terms global travel without restrictions, statement true. domestic activities return normal far then. work decently even 33-50% people following guidelines. high percentage people ""locked down"" even states governors anti-lockdown slowed spread. 

You need look recent spike higher percent violated guidelines holidays. happened earlier continued happen, would way, way worse off.

Of course, would 100% participation, lockdowns long all. Enough people violated keep virus rolling allowed nowhere US get fully control. fact COVID stay

If stay, what's endgame? Permanent masks social distancing? That's happening.  still catch said virus even said vaccine. Smh. Huh there‚Äôs clinic right next work see hundred people day go get one  Assuming stays asymptomatic decently well established he'll less likely pass on. he's actually presymptomatic much course took account risk baby got covid seemed much worse.

What got everyone compares covid flu. Covid like hoary old childhood diseases like measles, mumps, rubella. rubella causes birth defects. existence make it. people looking election times instead put vested interests common good, them. Americans going live Trump's disastrous legacy long time.

If Americans can't secure elections interference them. Americans can't organise better healthcare them. country (or state) thinks better leave border open them. like Facebook allows anti-vaxx, Facebook users return accept that.

Australia better healthcare system closed borders. Life basically normal Australia. economy took slight dent. major increases suicides people going hungry. Soon able travel thousands kilometers west, south north without fear covid19, wanted.

Toughening exactly world do. adapt climate crisis, resilience, robustness strength communities develop, better cope.  instead make society complacent naive predicaments fail address matters most. one hospital mandates employees vaccinate another doesn't, know one I'm going to. said anything locking anything up? thing mentioned delaying Super Bowl months it‚Äôs warmer people parties outside - it‚Äôs safer. early February it‚Äôs even cold Florida. 

I don‚Äôt understand inconceivable option. get people vaccinated

I'm going stop right there. people vaccinated, shit over. 7.3. Internal travel section covers internal travel restrictions ‚Äì international travel restrictions covered document . Summary evidence One epidemiological study (231) four simulation studies (114, 162, 232, 233) related internal travel restrictions included review. time-series analysis study conducted USA showed frequency domestic airline travel temporally associated rate influenza spread, following September 11 attacks 2001, reduction travel delayed epidemic peak 13 days compared average years (231). simulation study predicted implementation strict travel restriction (95% travel restriction, enforced 4 weeks) could reduce epidemic peak 12%, moderate restriction (50% travel restriction, enforced 2‚Äì4 weeks) could delay pandemic peak 1‚Äì1.5 weeks (162). Another simulation study predicted internal travel restriction 80% could beneficial (232). strict internal travel restriction (90%) also consistently found delay epidemic peak 2 weeks United Kingdom, less 1 week USA (114). However, 75% restriction almost effect (114).

I keep pasting this, think relevant now. WHO's 2019 Non Pharmaceutical Interventions guide summarized evidence kind measures pandemic influenza mention reducing total deaths section, delaying peak flattening curve. even then, extremely strict 80% restriction type found effective merely *delaying* spread, stopping even reducing total spread. 95% travel reduction reduced peak 12% only. Virus gonna virus. 

Is different virus,with slightly different properties? sure. understanding anything, contagious, lower IFR Spanish flu 1918 had, amateur opinion would reduce ""lockdowns"" effectiveness.

TL'DR:IMO epidemiologists 2019 right. I'm talking employees wearing gloves business. Afaik CDC commented regular people wearing gloves around town. Yep existing vaccines, spreading 2nd dose 12 weeks get 1st dose many people possible. get vaccinated good. could sworn saw hose hospital well. realized might one

Also worth noting documentary, even Philly height peak (actual bodies streets) churches still fighting gathering size restrictions. would sure hell rather get asymptomatically pass people would get asymptomatically get full force pass people full force... reality cure massive numbers people vaccinated Good thing science hasn‚Äôt advanced last 50 years. faith, I'm taking day day looking facts. I'd love dead wrong able go party summer without danger, that's reality we're living right now, whether like  good! 1 teacher doses they‚Äôre EMT. hasn‚Äôt gotten sick teaches small group. 

I first dose lucky far, it‚Äôs stressful though. needs done Europe. needs finite date inhumane seemingly endless lockdowns, else people give up. entirely lockdowns, would abide concrete promise would end May 1st something. regardless infections keep giving new reasons lock down. let government everything order make happen, let us free specific date goal.

Even prisoners get know release date. 1) don‚Äôt know you‚Äôre getting downvoted - wasn‚Äôt me. 

2) guess I‚Äôm saying mutations dropping neutralization rate vaccines isn‚Äôt end world - doesn‚Äôt mean continue use distancing masks everyone‚Äôs (80% probably max) vaccinated vaccines neutralization effectiveness might go down. mutation causes virus bypass neutralization vaccine built immunity *does result serious illness* transitioned novel virus (a new virus bodies don‚Äôt idea fight) virus experience fighting - like *every virus humans overcome*.

If want take precautions covid - may well lock homes wear masks forever.... one wants that.

Preventing serious illness hospitalization *in most* enough get us back living. idaho opposite, id say less 25% people local grocery store masks went morning. New Zealand much smaller population. they're...you know...an island. Meanwhile Europe .... see, honestly quite disappointed months now. think OP point, may come organized public resistance. guy asymptomatic mean people passes be. Ah Deaths, hospitalizations, loved ones general fear also toll. Agreed. Maybe 20% less calories good want chinese obesity epidemic India. Helps dying due coronavirus well. Stereotypical Indian diet needs protein though, improve quality diet rather simply adding calories. Florida surged similar rate hypothesis, given they're unrestricted. anything, numbers ballpark restricted states, much fewer deaths northeast. NY remains top Deaths / 1M pop chart. Extremely doubtful. one going stand yearly lockdown  Yeah there‚Äôs probably tons reasons. live U.K. don‚Äôt really follow Dutch news much I‚Äôm sure govt handled rather dragged EU (and poorer eastern member states) would‚Äôve effective. Netherlands lot pharmaceutical companies &amp; technical know + enough money should‚Äôve easy sailing alas. person replied said friend worried affecting ability kids. China billion people. Sure norm North Americans, normal occurrence China. Everything pre covid led us point ignoring problem acting like 'rebel' making situation better. entire process proven fight anything, one wants give anything personally precive inconvenience personal beliefs. projecting. New Zealand strictest lockdowns world along robust social safety net they're, comparatively,  Vaccinating people going ""pressure"" virus anything goddamn it, sentient. awareness attempts stop it. mutating randomly mutate less people vaccinated, thus reducing likelihood vaccine resistant variant. 100%. Americans disagree redditors, know right?  earth would tolerate food rationing? new. tested. Quit parroting shitty vaccine myths. healthcare vaccine deniers ones take continuing education serious parrot exact things have. understanding even people asymptomatic serious pulmonary damage, think giving less effective vaccine lower risk groups would help. primary function prevent symptomatic disease. vaccines evaluated that's exactly we're finding. likely spread reduced vaccine compared without we're still waiting proven disproven.

this need rush vaccinate everyone everyone everyone many people, covid straw broke camels back. United States building mental health crises decades. Things like stagnant wages, social media, stress, obesity, diets large amounts refined sugars processed fillers, student loans, opioid epidemic, etc created perfect storm. Add isolation covid get today. 

If thoughts depression self harm, need seek professional help get treated. substitute professional help. 

There things reduce stress, happier. Again, replacement professional help needed. help improve mood stress levels people. 

1) exercise. lot data research shows regular moderate exercise reduce stress give positive outlook. Something simple going 20 min walk morning huge positive impact day. 

2) eat cleaner foods. saying eat kale chicken breast. reduce much fast food sweets eat increase fruits veggies. 

3) read book. Even 15-30 mins day. Reading great way reduce stress. many types books there, everyone find something enjoy. 

4) try new hobbies. Things like learning musical instrument great ways reduce stress. typically find lot used instruments online relatively cheap. Maybe want learn cook certain dish style, maybe want start hiking geocaching. 

5) drink use recreational drugs moderation. 

6) reduce social media presence. People study addiction surprising studies notifications, debates, info see social media negatively impacts stress levels. Anecdotally, noticed huge improvement deleted Facebook instagram. also turned push notifications Reddit. 

7) try get routine. Plan exercise, read, cook, go sleep, etc. something important, block time. fly seat pants, stress knowing able something weigh mind. Allocate time won‚Äôt worry it. 

8) work finances. Read *I teach rich* gives 6 actionable steps organize automize finances. reduce lot stress. 

9) listed last, less important. Get 7-8 hours sleep night. ever problem vaccines?

That question forgot. Nobody cares understanding. think stupid people working one (that also rushed). Get high horse backup opinion instead attacking others. likely vaccine

Still faith colossal economic social need vaccinate everyone ease restrictions combined scientific method bring pandemic complete end reasonable time frame. otoh clearly don‚Äôt ignoring many ""mild"" cases cause myocardial infarction ground glass opacities. deciding entire generation people going chronic dangerous health conditions want give mRNA shot?  35 people TOTAL confirmed died Vietnam coronavirus.

Sorry trying antagonistic. learn COVID, think would happier year catching April May miserable three weeks rather ten months point. would hate live way. kind life that? Things bad Covid USA there‚Äôs place would rather live right now. Exactly *what* point?

I'd imagine asymptomatic people spread covid symptomatic people. Especially despite vaccinated. science wins. good. hope US politicians respect science more. Hell fuckin yes. Sounds like 4th July crazy year. certainly be.  meant So, know relative safety rf specific frequencies, like know specific vaccine relatively safe. true medical reason cannot take vaccine taking measures protect patients.. however ignorance willfully putting others danger. boss asked rub router would probably report HR regardless FCC testing status device.

Of Note, taken Pfizer vaccine would take moderna, J&amp;J Oxford vaccine (probably simultaneously though) without question using well understood methodologies. point enough data show benefits far outweigh minimal risks. Well think usa problem also healthcare system plays pandemic. probably ton avoidable deaths simply enough beds people getting treatment all. Add lackluster number sickdays people basically going work sickly difference. Wow, interesting stuff. Maybe could lead development super-vaccine. serious question? return normalcy depend Canada? want drive hit open nightclubs, least Americans vaccinated.

I‚Äôm sure lot people‚Äôs comfort depends concerned about. youngish healthy, I‚Äôm worried death hospitalization. I‚Äôm worried weird lingering long covid issues mild infection (which certainly get get weaker vaccine attempt resume full life plague Florida!)  What?? I'm going climb soap box. point sides need come terms science isn't.  

 

**For US Right:** can't ignore data altogether background field stop trying argue experiments flawed. Stop citing opinion pieces talk data verified truths. They're not. point start making rational decisions based real world observations. Spare theatrics *proof impossibility* asking people prove negative statements. Please *Gish Gallops*. Also, can't introduce left field expert pretend alternative theory equally robust. idea counter theory holds equal weight simply everyone entitled opinion just...ridiculous. theories trash. please stop pumping people bad theories simply like legislation introduced?  

 

**For US Left:** Science fact. Stop saying ""you trust scientific facts?"" Science made theories, mostly good theories consider ""robust"". However, sometimes they're really bad theories...or (*gasp)* even incorrect theories. collect better data, theories adjusted. Facts never get adjusted; facts absolute. nature, science never factual. flaw. tell Joe Smoe ""this science fact!"" 2 months later forced revise told new set experiments altered theory supports....Joe rightfully going throw face say ""but said fact changing facts?"" reason US left claiming science fact want force pet piece legislation based *facts*...""and could argue new law? based scientific facts!"" scientist, line guts every single time. based theories, facts.   

 

And getting problem US. Instead arguing merits actual laws decided, we're bogged people (most background field) arguing science *actually* correct. 

Let's take mandatory vaccines example. Yes, mandatory vaccine would data save lives. science would support theory (but admit definite, pretty robust though). Instead introduce argument whether science accurate *""will really save lives?""* *""is safe though?!?""*. ignore we're seeing. reality, people want law people find unethical force people get vaccine. That's real political argument.  nothing science, purely political. find arguments time time again, people think easier muddy water science talk actual governing. That's literally every topic science gone way past 20-30 years governing hard one wants talk aspect. 

**Science:** Science say laws made. People do. Recognize difference political argument scientific argument. I‚Äôm USA. unable get one yet state prioritizing young people cancer... maybe months things change able get one.   Everyone pro-teacher sub downvoted. It‚Äôs sad many people country don‚Äôt give shit teachers all. may able finish vaccine trials children year hope one's expecting toddler vaccinated 2021. Yup! like attitude. also consider developed miraculous amount time, provide option developing world available now. big part dealing virus development therapeutics - new repurposed. view vaccine multiple vaccines part solution little shortsighted - take holistic approach reduce impact Covid. vaccine much worse, Biontech. Efficacy lower, tested elderly people, can‚Äôt used again

What talking about? AstraZenica's tested UK South Africa, unclear much new variants impacted efficacy. tested elderly lol safe efficacious. Germany claimed there's enough data. Well, we'd like data, phase 3 clinical trials enroll million people, hard make every age group subgroup statistically significant. vector vaccine can‚Äôt modified corona mutations

Nonsense lol. simply adjust DNA inside viral even worse

It's literally single best vaccine far EVERY metric. isn‚Äôt fully domestic pathetic firm can‚Äôt supply even small UK

Well seem summer expected biontech vaccine doesn‚Äôt require deep cold

It require ULTRA cold storage. That's biggest downside. now? War EU fair agreement fair distribution?

I care either way. I'm Serbia enough vaccines China Russia. second best Europe number vaccinations per 100 people. I'm saying think EU hurt UK much comes vaccines.  virus mild humans happy engaged activities humans. Perhaps followed science better did. It‚Äôs quite helpful. People come anxiety people help assuage reference reality. apologies immediate concern wellbeing. want thread be, place express fucked world is? go r/news that, quite frankly kind thing circlejerk isn‚Äôt helpful anyone. Honestly kind feel like.... get lmao 

Like I‚Äôve heard J&amp;J capability bust fuck high quantities, single dose, easier get everything. Might easier lemming like get protection COVID, Pfizer Moderna ones continue go high risk essential workers gets me. 

Then get one go 60 95 percent

Maybe? Lol thought first read 

Argentina: tests per 1M: 132k / deaths per 1M: 1044 / 2020 GDP forecast: -12.9 %

Mexico tests per 1M: 30k / deaths per 1M: 1184 / 2020 GDP forecast: -8.0%

Macron said awaiting EMA's verdict - came later Friday - also France's health authority ""because numbers"".

The French expert decision vaccine expected start next week, according sources close health authority.

""I data, scientific team look numbers,"" Macron acknowledged.

Meanwhile, Germany's vaccine commission Friday maintained advice using AstraZeneca's coronavirus vaccines older people.

Everyone J&amp;J decided trials 2 doses.

The Novavax numbers really extraordinary, though. 96% efficacy older variants - higher either mRNA vaccine, though surprising given stronger phase 1 data. company never actually produced vaccine, though, far done deal. cold storage requirements either, it?  absolute joke. government implemented harsher travel restrictions, done year ago. extremely disappointing. people thinking childs left behind. Almost family friends NJ either fully vaccinated, gotten first dose, appointment. South Carolina I‚Äôm probably waiting 1B begin March. next marihuana machine? Smallpox virus ever eradicated. Forget eradication. It‚Äôs happening. grasping straws injecting thoughts ideas never said.

Here, I'll clear:

Here, city live, almost never see someone without mask public, whereas three hours away, small town parents live in, maybe 10 percent people wearing masks public.

Better? People completely exaggerate inflated view danger virus general, particularly kids. Kids little risk, thousands times less adult tens thousands times less elderly health conditions. role kids pandemic primarily carriers.

People simply understand this. see news report ""covid affect kids"" assume kids would start dropping dead went back school. Statistically literally one logic basically safety face mask undoubtedly gives others regards aerosol spread respiratory droplets nuclei would whole canceled people touching faces more, can't really say I've experienced people wearing masks.

I see saying masks = safer masks still dumb argument  Chicago better open damn beach year. sitting outside 20 feet people = spreading covid Lori!!! Brexit costs ya

Actions consequences. knew? 25% occupancy. many NYC restaurants, that's 1 table. Cool, let's ship half supply China India, half world's population resides.

We contracts business agreements. get suddenly decide redistribute limited supply. They'll breach contract, Canadians die without vaccines. Simple that. Well make every effort make sure come back? Vaccinate everyone kids make 20%+ population? everyone sits shocked pikachu face go years. Apparently it‚Äôs called ‚ÄòNo Tiers‚Äô source 8,000 doses site given. Unless ever charge coordinating daily doses absolutely terrible job, shouldn‚Äôt doses left day- never 9. pull fridge draw needed. takes 5 minutes draw 10 doses vial, there‚Äôs reason open vial know need least them. mean, yeah, wearing masks important. Fewer chances virus evolve. TLDR: state stopped sending doses medical center inoculated school employees ran Tier 1A candidates.

Damn huh? Iwas impressed humble kind too. question. nursing home definition home. choices stay hospital month go back home would choose leave hospital probably far cheaper.

Cuomo others criticized ""sending infected patients nursing homes"" options there? Maybe try create covid wards nursing homes talk families taking weeks recovered? many cases even option?

I also wonder handle things like flu outbreaks nursing homes previous years. first virus outbreak must common nursing homes.

The statistics nursing homes also something consider. US 1.5 million residents and, average, pre-Covid, 300-350k die every year, nearly 1000 per day. things like infection, sepsis, etc. average period time someone goes nursing home dies around 13 months.

I say simply puts fatalities perspective. 40% Covid fatalities nursing homes 178k past year. Statistically almost twice many would die anyway average loss life year. Definitely true every case puts perspective. GOD MODE people think COVID eradicated, least year? anyone know Bloomberg gets numbers? Someone said get numbers directly states accounts difference state reported 100k less vaccinations Bloomberg at.

Pissed off, bored, horny, yes. Anxious depressed, no. isn‚Äôt covid situation slowing US guess understand. kids go home school? houses still going crowded night? increase chances household becoming infected? I'm expert. many employees infected before? course they‚Äôd lie it. like managed reach edge universe. oversight, actually federal manpower. states scattered largely unorganized. Federal vaccination centers would likely directly taking shipments streamlining process. Would mean less red tape here, more.

Additionally, Biden administration unable account possibly high 20 million doses. That's insane least process needs taken away states. Best case scenario, suck record keeping, worst case, actually losing doses. done better many, Id agree that. But, know ppl confused system. One co 3 weeks behind, person thought going wait till feb get vaccine. talked someone found next county could take immediatly. better, still great.

It‚Äôs small pox guy. goal isn‚Äôt irradiate Covid prevent deaths even people still moderate Covid Clinical trials far seem suggest either Pfizer Moderna good choice. Realistically, matter much (and mine) age group. 


If read immunity generated vaccine, Pfizer/Moderna's mRNA solution really clever there's ""cool factor"". looking psychotic argument what‚Äôs said new variants require booster shots? need produced, ordered, distributed administered. already struggling vaccinate first doses. one shot expected without boosting. 

It's prime-boost scheme, one jab. add second injection J&amp;J vaccine, basically get homologous prime-boost method, method used AstraZeneca's AZD1222 well mRNA vaccines. see? Even mRNA vaccines require two injections order develop proper immunity designed. 

J&amp;J vaccine AD26 vector encoded produce S-protein.
The first component Sputnik-V design, reasons believe going work much differently. course, difference Sputnik-V uses heterologous prime-boost method, second component based AD5 vector. slightly expensive way it, studies suggest might better homologous prime-boost method. developers Sputnik-V tell going immunity first injection too, imagine far 66% achieved J&amp;J. Problem is, J&amp;J tested prime-boost schemes yet. soon enough, 66% single shot shabby. honestly even know number mRNA vaccines one shot. second shot provide IgG memory cells, immunogenic second jab. We''ll see reach AZD1222's efficacy, anything goes think going roughly prevention rate lifetime. may wrong ofc, see coming.

Oh, way. 66% enough revaccination. Like, take someone got Pfeizer Astra.. They'll need another vaccine time future. Maybe 9 months, maybe year, maybe two, happen. Hopefully time damned corona mutate enough render vaccines useless, case person able annual boost J&amp;J

TLDR, need compare apples apples

Single shot one thing, that's J&amp;J tested now
Homologous prime-boost another, that's ADZ1222 mRNA
Heterogous prime-boost third thing, that's Sputnik-V

Prime boost methods compared that's supposed finalized solution. Comparing boosted methods single shot hand, well... say much. Cue mask burning bye bye forever (with middle finger) Zoom parties, people going wild make lost time. I'm guessing mostly seasonality along enough already infected get R&lt;1 new faster spreading strains. Last March probably happened slower spreading strains. Vaccines likely small % effect far effect ramp rapidly coming months hopefully end pandemic good. site exactly scream reliable. site shows 52 doses every 100 people everyone requires two doses. seemed imply one knew yet would you. medical professionals ops people running trial (scheduling payment) would take grain salt... think likely correct misinformed. actually true? I've heard always wondered true  likely studies agree, nature field research. must evaluate studies individual merits, rather search unanimous majority agreement. 

The Harvard article cite studies suggested children contribute much spread coronavirus. recent studies raise concerns children could capable spreading infection. 

These two statements conflict other. Children may capable spreading coronavirus without contributing much spread coronavirus. Additionally, sources evidentiary support provided.

The following research deficiencies: asymptomatic patients transmit virus others, emerging evidence suggests asymptomatic index cases transmit fewer secondary cases. Attack rates highly correlated symptom main author explains results layman's terms here: Question: new studies long term effects mRNA vaccine? understood pretty new technology.

Disclaimer: anti vaxx vaccine soon possible, curious supply controversy affecting Q1 seems related EU supply beint cut Q1 due problems EU plant. Still looks fine rest year. AZ plants seem issues mean modern western philosophy, culture, government based Greek Roman civilization arguably genesis modern Europe Western Culture. Everything languages writing system traced back Ancient Rome &amp; Greece. certainly contributors western countries overwhelmingly based early civilizations. SinoVac regards infection, even asymptomatic, efficacious.

They report separate efficacy PCR testing asymptomatic infections, mild symptoms, moderate/severe symptoms. 

This stringent benchmark possible. COVID-19 seems somewhat like influenza, that, it‚Äôs going keep creating variants. We‚Äôll probably getting periodic booster shots decades come. Canada, yes. Otherwise administration already stoking wars China Russia. link goes say studied B cells, persisted even antibodies declined: ""RBD- NCP-specific Bmem cells predominantly expressed IgM+ IgG1+ continued rise 150 days.""

Your link address Covid all.

Vaccines also less effective new variants; look today's numbers Johnson &amp; Johnson. That's reason say vaccines work general. likely makes twice easy administer. need put half many shots arms, don‚Äôt need worry finding people 3-4 weeks later. don‚Äôt need worry supply chain steady enough deliver second shots right time. equal alternative things never equal. option (a healthy 28 year old work home) take two shot vaccine takes vaccine someone else may higher risk. goal right vaccinate many people fast possible. waiting three months get two shot vaccine best course action moment one shot available. (timeline hypothetical obviously)

I also think touting equal alternative. efficacy clear. reality non high risk individuals/non healthcare workers etc... need highest level efficacy, especially vaccinate faster rate That's I'm saying perhaps due lack clarity part. I'm saying use BRE deliver doses EU manufacturing (i.e. two sub obligations - (1) BRE deliver doses; (2) BRE manufacture EU). key point though nothing requires use UK facilities deliver doses. use BRE.  really. resist new novel things eventually give comply. Nobody complains much public nudity laws. Smoking indoors fine long time wasn‚Äôt. think usually takes decade normalize something it‚Äôs possible. read Nate Silver Twitter thread eventually COVID another illness like flu. might get COVID shot year. That‚Äôs good enough me, prevents worst cases uses trusted established vaccine technology  Gambling odd term context. US provided funding virtually every western vaccine development funded manufacturing risk, Sanofi one those. I'd hardly call throwing billion potentially gamechanging yet unproven vaccines gambling, particularly time they're spending trillions due virus vaccines hoping end. 

Maybe EU heeded Sanofis CEOs warning last May EU risk falling behind US needs invest aggressively vaccines. Sinovac hear 50% PCR test efficacy. Wonder PCR efficacy JJ? Fauci says U.S. could possibly reach degree normality fall, mean? Packed broadway shows? Packed subway trains?

He‚Äôs saying virus chances mutation. anti-vaxxers risking live/health everyone else‚Äôs too. google search. Building research SARS MERS vaccines...mRNA vaccine technology already developed. Question could one get vaccine mRNA based booster? wondering find comfort mRNA based vaccines ability boosters ready quickly new strains. I'm saying obligation deliver applies doses manufactured within EU. capitalising try make clear clearly failed. obligations (1) use BRE manufacture doses EU; (2) use BRE deliver doses. think agree that.

Also again, never said 5.4 pertain Initial Doses well doses. think nothing 5.4 requires use UK facilities fulfill BRE obligations 5.1 5.1 simply separate set obligations. Again, think actually disagree that.

The crux BRE point somewhat dodge. BRE definition quite weak. Much weaker plain construction ""best efforts"" probably closer ""reasonable endeavours"". given strict requirement contract use UK facilities fulfill order initial doses, obligation use BRE deliver doses 5.1 seem require AZ breach UK contract (which according reports requires use UK capacity fulfill UK order first). EU effectively trying require AZ do. response point? think anything contract would require AZ use UK facilities fulfill order would involve breaching contractual obligations commercial relationships? think point pointless back forth us due perhaps reading much phone based typing. here. keeps hospital put shit arm asap. tbh ways I'm kind hoping get J&amp;J since I'm fan needles lol Also civilization based Greco-Roman traditions political philosophy. behind curve since day one. adoption IHR 2005 became political they‚Äôve less efficient, less trustworthy. cave diplomatic pressure, worse self censor. held responsible response virus. thing trump right breaking them.

We've able eradicate 2 diseases successfully till date. however reduce risk covid point longer concern almost like flu Man. 89% effective still incredible. remember long ago would've considered 60-70% success. 60% Israel got vaccine numbers i'm looking at. seeing that? wearing papr respirator ebola 2 cloth masks. far far easier breath cloth masks Masks wouldn‚Äôt help flu season?

One other. know certain vaccines weaken Covid (make less painful lethal) even new mutations prove lessen effectiveness. much important question mutations ineffective vaccination rates prolong pandemic. might looking another year this.

Turns SARS-‚ÄãCoV-2 going much tougher opponent previously belived. probably actively fighting booster vaccines decades come. USA! USA! USA! I've saying this. sometimes wish pfizer/moderna came abit later atleast probably whole shitting vaccine efficient another one. End day I'm taking whatever vaccine get.  Exactly. grim even Rona bites dust Abso-fucking-lutely. keep hearing line Reddit maybe Southern California thing, experience different. live San Francisco, think I've ever seen anyone inside store without mask on. also estimate 95% people wearing masks outdoors. literally opened outdoor dining almost two months (outdoor dining closed spite fact San Francisco never went 15% ICU capacity, even black box ""adjusted"" ICU capacity number). 

Now, SF banned outdoor dining, people stay home? Absolutely not. congregated indoors other's homes. That's many us believed counter-intuitive ban outdoor dining. coping skills. support network really important. People living somewhere work stuck that. I'm full proponent universal health care US, story seems give credibility private insurance fetishists... God never thought I‚Äôd hear phrase ‚Äúno new Covid cases since-‚Äù. I‚Äôve waiting headlines accounts like these. Think person asked British journalist. yeah, country that's horribly hit COVID, given crap tonnes help others regardless, also getting guilt trip here. 

It's also weird they're pushing particular, mortality poorest countries affected many things. I'm quite confuse folks saying could (within US) start summer (June 1st sake discussion). right rounding approximately 29 million given shots. pace vaccinations keep approximately 1.7 million day it'd take approximately 293 days give 80% United States population two shots vaccinated. 

June 1st 122 days away- Presuming average 1.7 million day given then- we'd 236.4 million shots given 118.2 million vaccinated Americans. 

Factors course cannot take consideration 1) J&amp;J vaccine distribution 2) raw amount Americans acquired immunity prior infection. 

I'm expert whatsoever- I'm still confused June would possible. (Fall good) Australia large number idiots - chief advantage seems mass population fucked up, frothing, cretins US has. 

If hear bullshit 'its island' one time ... Interstate ever happen. Period.

The executive branch unilaterally end entries foreign nations, can't state boarders, congress that. cannot cognitively understand people, facts available quickly, stupid selfish.  USA screwed..the best days country come gone it‚Äôs downhill here. palestenians already refused lsrael help(which offered vaccinations started). using russian vaccine. Damn I‚Äôm sorry hear that. That‚Äôs horrible. Yay! Great news! think great option, option requirement. worked home exclusively years noticed increasingly relying getting outside house exactly 5pm every day desperate around people. really underestimated value random revelations come idle hallway chatter, too. finally enough looked around in-person office job.

Joke's me. started March 1st, 2020 WFH two weeks later. Well, case ill enjoy stay. much cryogenic storage think Somolia vs US? I've cautiously optimistic things (here US) get better summer, fall latest. Competency top government, million people vaccinated day, J&amp;J vaccine getting closer approval gives hope this. However, type reporting done news media commenters reddit really tried poke holes cautious optimism.

Here couple examples think of. New Year's Day evening, local news station story one might expect things improve. reporter began saying something along lines ""2021 going look whole lot like 2020"" went say day day lives change almost end year. Another example comment saw yesterday reddit post Coachella getting canceled (which course would takes place spring). commenter said ""[Coronavirus is] going away 2021"" something along lines.

When comes ""normality"", care primarily three things: 1) Full fan attendance sporting events, 2) full indoor dining restaurants, 3) Stage theater performances. three things happen year, year would better that.

Lastly, vested interest things getting back semblance ""normal."" planning looking first job last April, pandemic put grinding halt plans. I've since put life hold things get control.

So question is, still reason hope things better summer? frankly want put life hold another whole year.

How 'guaranteed be', want actually accurate headline? rest world? there‚Äôs also represent real life scenarios. effects observed places like Israel soon. deaths vaccines Covid 19 minimal reduce risk significantly. study also states insufficient data analyse prospect sterilising immunity vaccines means data needs collected. never ending pandemic neither plausible, realistic. pandemic ever lasted forever possible so. Previous coronavirus related pandemics (Russia 1889-1890) ended expiring. Covid 19 pandemic different? Also, modelling state 400,000 deaths every single year? lot people take vaccine, protecting immune systems, consistently topped exposure virus endemic nature virus presents.

Also point current restrictions 400,000 die per year anyway? seems fruitless endeavour minimise infection seems, according study, vaccines impact pandemic little nothing. 

In conclusion, see effects vaccinations large populations - context historical vaccination programmes measles, smallpox, polio tetanus, even vaccines comparatively low efficacy produce substantial impacts population. Vaccines efficacy Pfizer Moderna impact pandemic. Even seasonal influenza vaccines reduce deaths illness despite way effectively targeted. vaccines targeted, modified future continue prevent deaths illness. 

We hopeful happy vaccines efficacy, relying implausible scenarios created study suggests ‚Äònever-ending pandemic‚Äô. one thread worth listening to.

I'm sure want vaccine that's 65% effective thing is, trying tell us ignore data science (which clearly shows schools causing community infections students much lower rates infections rest society), ignore common sense (that would know schools causing significant infections, like able see nursing homes), ignore recommendations CDC, ignore recommendations state local government, ignore Dr Fauci, ignore Medical Associations.......and simply believe tell us. 

They gaslighting us! everyone's sense drama, waiting plot twist. media would love would give weeks doom headlines. EU decided last summer would completely different situation. supply chains set mistakes people issue with. area lower socioeconomic status cause psychological distress? interesting. stop two masks? face shields head bubbles? definitely high performing team send accurate consistent messaging. CDC driven seemed dazed start reacting rather taking front seat communication. lot mixed science beginning sorted that. daily brief hot topics, things know, know, distribute front page every media outlet provide consistent non-opinionated way get info. people looked social media validate inconsistent media interpretation science. mean I‚Äôd rather get sick all... said won‚Äôt picky available I‚Äôd happily quarantine another couple weeks get one much likely prevent getting sick all.  I'm still shocked many people wear masks KS. NOBODY wore awhile wave come people started wearing them. numbers dropped back instead continuing wear masks helped stop spread, half people went back wearing again. restaurants bars back open area. require masks they've removed tables people still easily within 6 feet couple restaurants I've driven by.

I went library day nice lady runs note door asking people wear masks husband health issue high risk category. figure small town Christian values people would listen want help lady husband. nope, half people see wear masks. Sometimes wish could get Covid go cough assholes faces. give 1% chance happening outside hospitals rich countries hoarding vaccines, manufacturing them. problem people refuse vaccinate giving virus flexibility mutate potential strain vaccines prepare for. idea education campaign assuage trepidation would look like, need fucking take it. Let religious leaders moral compass

I think terrible idea Get Covid-19 Vaccine First, Pope Francis First world problems lose shit returning normal (which guess it‚Äôs either want ‚Äúright‚Äù ‚Äúnormal rite passage‚Äù certain areas - way, widespread romanticize). Meanwhile, highest rate HIV world, rogue militias roam Africa even recruit child soldiers, female genital mutilation, Ebola, malnutrition thousands affecting children, malaria, amongst others. 

The World sucks

Also delegitimize anyone‚Äôs problems, done much sooner them. shed empathy fellow man. Cant wait till wear masks every day. Yes. wouldn‚Äôt they? fund every transit system.  Religious idiots insist holding mass super spreader events. 

The sub's rules prohibit comment. No. I'm ohio. know of, ohio Michigan holiday spikes. state may exception nationally holiday spike. nothing vaccines Florida state mandate anything.. yet ""fine"" true mRNA vaccines. close 90% first dose look post ~2 weeks.

Dr. Paul Stoffels, chief scientific officer Johnson &amp; Johnson, told NPR Friday topline results company's coronavirus vaccine study fail tell full story effective actually is.

Johnson &amp; Johnson said 28 days vaccination, vaccine 66% effective preventing moderate severe cases COVID-19. Stoffels says Johnson &amp; Johnson's vaccine effective matters most: preventing hospitalizations deaths.

""We showed 85% efficacy severe disease complete protection hospitalization complete protection death. that's across regions, including South Africa,"" says.

A new coronavirus variant first discovered South Africa already popped U.S. Johnson &amp; Johnson's vaccine 57% effective preventing moderate severe cases country, variant dominates. still 89% effective stopping severe disease, hospitalization death South Africa, Stoffels says.

Johnson &amp; Johnson's study included participants U.S., Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, Peru South Africa. Unlike two-dose vaccines Pfizer Moderna, Johnson &amp; Johnson's vaccine administered single dose.

""That's remarkable results: show single dose prevent across world, 85%, severe cases complete[ly] death hospitalization,"" Stoffels says.

Stoffels said entirely right compare Johnson &amp; Johnson results Pfizer Moderna ‚Äî whole showed stronger protections, also measure effectiveness differently Johnson &amp; Johnson. spoke NPR's Ailsa Chang effectiveness fast vaccine could available. Stoffels says Johnson &amp; Johnson apply emergency use authorization Food Drug Administration next week.

Here excerpts interview:

To people may understand science, sounds like Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine effective [as Pfizer Moderna vaccines]. would answer that?

It's difficult compare. study done different times different environments background different strains. circulating virus today intense much attacking immune system. direct comparison vaccines. what's mattered getting protect[ion] dying getting hospitalization severe disease. worked extremely well. getting, single dose, protecting hospitalization severe disease matters pandemic. everywhere world simple way.

So feel confident say that, yes, people might still get sick ... vaccine really help ease burden health care system proven completely effective preventing hospitalizations deaths one month out.

Absolutely. recruited also high-risk populations, including favelas Brazil, including townships South Africa across ages. diverse population world. also saw vaccine equally efficacious ages, also strong feature mostly elderly people highest risk dying, hospitalization.

Your shot 72% effective preventing moderate severe COVID-19 U.S., 57% effective South Africa. signal variant first identified South Africa?

It signals needs immune response protected. severe, 89% prevention severe diseases. well-known vaccination preventing severe diseases typically good. Like influenza, prevent vaccination, prevent severe disease. happening COVID, too. preventing moderates, light symptoms, difficult show, lower South Africa, likely due strain, still preventing severe cases possible vaccine, big relief done.

How much shot Johnson &amp; Johnson make soon?

We started last year March knew going needed. Never history many vaccines needed. production capacity available. started building plans committed deliver billion doses course year. gradually able deliver throughout year we'll work individual governments communicate population vaccine available particular countries.

Which vaccine people get? mean, would recommend vaccine certain groups people versus others?

It's health care authorities countries. what's essential vulnerable people, elderly, co-morbidities, get vaccinated fast highest risk getting sick dying.

But I'm happy, actually, person, father, family member, they're many vaccines available, probably multi-billion people vaccinated over. collection vaccines collaboration pharmaceutical companies able combat disease world. that's vaccine place. every vaccines place combating pandemic.

Article continues No. won‚Äôt wear masks believe conspiracy theories. don‚Äôt think need wear masks unless symptoms, spreads asymptomatically too. wear public comes don‚Äôt get reported.. don‚Äôt wear around other. Also telling someone snitch dangerous bro. don‚Äôt see snitching. They‚Äôre violating health codes. thanks advice? lol.. even know 150 people :( lot money trials go fast disease contagious Damn could shit Shakespeare‚Äôs greatest hits would toilet day erry day. tl;dr: supply never what's holding us back. Damn, mine constantly rubbed raw top, even back head stretcher things. Strings still gotta go them

I guess need... thicker skin. Badumm tssss heard whole ‚Äúit takes 10 times effort dispute bullshit produce it?‚Äù 

The guy shitter it‚Äôs obvious article. go ahead spread propaganda want people see it. wish they'd sort volume levels out, excellent. could speculate, Chicago also loves bureaucracy see small spikes holiday times. definitely less contributory effect burning less careful people, said. Dakotas willing ‚Äúsacrifice‚Äù 0.2% population keep bars churches fully open. Baby talk night  Yep

How dare science medicine try save people preventable death? 

It‚Äôs obviously nefarious plot to...do...what exactly? It‚Äôs literally first sentence article. vaccinated teachers even though hadn‚Äôt vaccinated community‚Äôs older residents (1A+ Georgia teachers 1B).... Another direct quote article ‚ÄúThe Medical Center Elberton skipped ahead Georgia‚Äôs ‚Äú1A+‚Äù vaccination phase, violating agreement state‚Äù. It‚Äôs like didn‚Äôt even read article all, don‚Äôt TLDR. Globally? know, important. matters country-by-country. Israel, maybe next week. Somalia, maybe well 2022 honestly.

Also, completely innocent questions *always* get downvoted?  GenXers unite! üòã Don‚Äôt care. Gimmeeeeeee mean, there‚Äôs two types people ignore general protocols communicating scientific research. People right can‚Äôt convince scientific establishment people peddling conspiracy nonsense. second group far far larger first. 

And issue isn‚Äôt works free‚Äî I‚Äôm pro-open access publishing. issue he‚Äôs published platform allows avoid peer review concerning. generally get good paper sound science published somewhere peer review, would skip step?  I‚Äôm Australia though find similar many countries - apart specialty training many people end postgrad studies help career progression anyways. found statistics good fit always math nerd even med school üòÜ Kinda makes sense. doctors/nurses help people, hospitals business. looks like Moderna contracted manufacturing Swiss company Lonza, Lonza trouble ramping supply. shipments outside US delayed across board.

Shipments within US affected US making supply. shipments US also behind schedule - 100m doses Moderna supposed ship US Q1, they've shipped 32m far.  Yeah. warm hug... right here. nothing lower movement holidays. It‚Äôs burned less careful people. Look North South Dakota. peaked mid November. Current vaccination efforts part held distribution challenges (the need super cold temps) well manufacturing. know efforts made scaling manufacturing process mrna vaccines vaccines approved increased stability higher temps, see explosion vaccines/day.

PRESS RELEASE: Paid content PR Newswire
Press release content PR Newswire. AP news staff involved creation. I‚Äôm Swedish live Sweden.

So there‚Äôs that. mean, buddy. got Mexico holiday destination. We've got Bali, Indonesia ours. Thailand guess? Vietnam, Singapore, actually come think it, South East Asia cheap travel to. offered similar activities üòÇ Cuomo's sudden 180 reopening one baffling plot twists pandemic. solid reasons expect vaccine substantially efficient prime-boost scenario. hope NZ afford two shots per vaccinated person, really makes difference.
Also, guess upcoming halved Sputnik + AZD1222 combo successful applicable J&amp;J + AZD1222 combo. use AD26 vector.
And worst come worst, let's hope damned corona change beyond recognition immunity two years time. case used boost otherwise developed immunity future interesting falling faster rose last peak. 

This opposite first two peaks saw fast rise long slow fall. 

That would indicate maybe vaccinations partially responsible fall. want one, want 99% ones Concerts summer? way well. nurses cnas clean rooms. 4 rooms per nurse/cna. numbers prior holiday season still stayed even holiday season. Google? guy previously pinpointed outbreak began first infected people. Dr Quay isnt nobody. Sure sceptical since sell books, atleast try bit open possibility here. first time brought up.
Im pretty sure smarter people us read papers make counter right wrong. disputing claims based pages publications sell books (although research papers free read) taking bit far man wall like structure seperating US Mexico US recovers. Oh wait Thank you! knew people hospitalized possibly due limited/no health insurance, hospital eager discharged (one way another) families contact patient coordinator, (aka bill collector) actual nurse/doctor. wise, there's obvious concerns mixing beyond stronger immune responses initially vaccinated. 

Can link anything authoritative discussing this? seems like guessing this. I'm reading 10% long term effects controlled people flu timeframe. sample average age real. really hard time criticism. everyone get sometimes good admit problem needing fix. also believe point getting vaccine since still need wear mask, social distance, still get covid pass others.

Can't blame them.

They've told there's near-miracle vaccine change single thing lives they've it.

Not really incentive. California 3 million doses administered  ideas children able get it? God bless!! Thank scientists/researchers developed vaccines! really wanto get debate whether life go back normal summer whatever, referring article actually saying. may restrictions intrnational travel. Nothing night clubs, likely come free unrestricted travel Ethiopia. pandemic 1918 2 years? PANIC! Great, please give us some. Love, Canada. got first dose vaccine today! Count in! Takes little training give immunizations. Pharmacy technicians give giving two shots instructor practice setting. third shot ever give Covid vaccine someone. Everyone reddit seems lack kind long term memory. Every country fucked pandemic point time everyone seems forget ever happened something new pops up. 

I know you, still remember Italy deemed unprepared/incompetent first outbreaks hit. UK. US. EU praised keeping virus bay summer... didn't. Sometime around Australians fighting outbreaks soil. goes.. UK good, US good EU bad socialist bureaucratic incompetent hell hole something new happens.

I'm trying defend attack anyone, I'm pointing nature viral diseases. on/off switch, lingers, moving one place another locally globally. best worst tomorrow new mutation comes along respond well bypasses vaccine immunity.

Let's respect victories failiures shit ends. Everyone tired living half-life year, bickering help. guess think difference setting goal making promise.

The Trump admin made many promises keep.

I think Biden could legitimately promised 100 million doses 100 days, set goal somewhere 150 200 million doses, making clear things same. Flu rates plummet. one want restrictions like flu.  Lol really can‚Äôt believe downvotes implying government shouldn‚Äôt force injection people unwillingly. fun times. Funny... customers show muscles AZ managed fix issues.

Who could expected Probably horsing around wrong people. California necessarily done well despite lockdowns. Thing is, often times covid spread happens within households within private residences. Look Super Bowl next week. restaurants/bars closed, people wont shelter house, go celebrate friends. lot people gathered Christmas/Thanksgiving. really matter bars closed case. Spread still happen.

I dont think people get strict Chinese lockdown was. heard leave house. expense people lol, especially old vulnerable.

Its fine selfish, are. obvious hipocrisy makes laugh Brazil worse Latin American countries

Mexico Argentina left wing presidents, Brazil really delusional think people gonna put restrictions another year.

People putting *now*, dude. agree, people slacking them, whether people like restrictions mean they're bad idea overall. disease stop inconvenience reaches boiling point.

 that's funny , beginning pandemic everyone ""experts"" main news sites saying life get back normal vaccine found. suddenly vaccines ""magic bullet"" ? Give break

Mutations. Read history book, please. second wave 1918 Flu far deadliest *mutated strain*. think would like person refusing work WiFi router invented tested manner FCC always requires routers tested. 

Then imaging one .001% people severe allergies rf boss said ""you better rub router face fired"". still job biohazard suit, gloves mask guy demands make love router. Kinda ridiculous ln guy never sees customers think?

Just someone healthcare worker mean can't job safely mean even see patients either. There's chance could severe allergic reaction vaccine. Even though believe vaccine I'll get number can't say certainty 100% safe know 100% effective either. Even still transmit virus vaccination, extremely likely window transmit much smaller, viral load would also lower. Past research indicated infected initial lower viral load leads infections little less serious. transmission window seriously reduced (which practically certainty) it'll also reduce reproduction number quite bit. result would still overwhelmingly positive. Ouch...not yet strokes heart attacks.. know personally. really idea, that's glib. ignore commenters here. Many want pandemic end You‚Äôre alone. I‚Äôm similar place. I‚Äôm saving much commuting I‚Äôm stressing money first time years. Building savings. Spending fun stuff Christmas. Extra sleep every day great. Seeing kids diner time great. dealing office BS vapid coworker chatter great. Canada: buys 5x vaccines needed make sure shortage + donate countries can't otherwise afford them

American vaccine companies: lol fuck  No. vaccinated, probably golden. recovered, probably good immunity. get enough people vaccinated, enough people spread antivax dolts. 

There *possibility* *may*, *someday* need boosters, know yet. Here's daily [number hell wrong two? last time mass vaccination program US 1976 swine flu outbreak, vaccine program stopped 25% already vaccinated paralyzing killing people. Gerald Ford even went television take vaccine encourage it. Since then, Congress passed new laws vaccine companies liability sued produce bad vaccines kill people. Making vaccine mandatory irresponsible considering it‚Äôs already troubled history. anything ethnicity, reporting diseases separated ethnicity? People obviously care ethnicity/culture, better worse. long people think important, important unfortunately. much doom gloom eyes admitting I've suspecting along. think didnt want panic public, constant changing ideas, think due science,(I mean novel, I'm health care -I know means, ) thought public could hear. however created great distrust amongst many people. Honestly know believe myself. actual new variant saying get people inside more? stupid governor quit allowing outside dining, one thing spread wanted people stay home..which freely admitted. ( everyone privileged pals). causes resentment rule breaking. nothing enforced. called mandatory masks March one thousand dollar fines first offense, another fine 14 days boot home arrest 2nd offense. got called facist..but notice New Zealand pretty good now. get can‚Äôt say immune vaccine people area would somehow fuck message too. don‚Äôt know everything virus &amp; vaccine yet. info people get it. protect others? need something show people convince them. 
If is, please point it. mean worldwide.

If vaccine sight, seems we'd lockdown measures ... years? Duhh?? obvious? Haha Horspital Anyone talking 18s singular cohort idea talking about. It‚Äôs shown primary schools far less risk transmission (one theory less ACE2 repertory virus bind children).

Important remember though risk death 18s using IFR lower seasonal flu. likely USA added UK‚Äôs 'red list' no-direct flights &amp; mandatory hotel quarantine?

I've read 'red list' countries arrivals UK soon face mandatory hotel quarantine cover ¬£1600 bill. roughly 30 counties due prevalence new strain, although I'm curious likelihood USA added list next month so? (The US recorded 2 cases South Africa variant yesterday brazil one.)
I've heard someone cite economic ties US &amp; UK could mean gov would apprehensive close travel down, idea validity claim.
Despite cases new strains imagine would add whole USA red list bit widespread considering that's handful cases 350m people. (its 2 50 states right 'apparently' control.)
Anyway would appreciate opinions I'm sure political &amp; epidemiological factors go past news stories might shed bit light question. Thank Right, people making stuff based upon fears imaginations. think asinine people saying, ""well happens??"" reason think would actually happen. I'm legitimate concerns critical feel like people paranoid point. first dose yesterday, something happens 10 years guess joke's me.  That's exactly what's happening. That's Biden announced recruitment servicemen help vaccinate. Operation warp speed joke. They're going streamline distribution military like done first place, exception still utilizing private carriers. 

I've telling people weeks wait J&amp;J. Even numbers still huge game changer. think we're see mass vaccination events whole School districts getting vaccinated like back old days. know people mean 'life normal'. 

No, don't. kind normal referring to? People ITT talking going nightclubs soon like that's even feasible safely near-future. 

I get impression people ITT saw headline commented reflexively that's thing people seem talking about. Eventually we're going say ""enough enough"". Yeah co-worker mine wife still sleeping next sick avoided knows lol thanks info said definitely did, said easy understand could be. Nothing said proven variant, original otherwise, caused infections wave. Probably safe assume COVID-induced inflammatory responses impact organ body system. makes sense. since inflammation also lead cancer emergence, point we‚Äôre going see increased cancer related COVID. answer questions still unknown, know answer far less problematic without vaccination. really delusional think people gonna put restrictions another year. that's funny , beginning pandemic everyone ""experts"" main news sites saying life get back normal vaccine found. suddenly vaccines ""magic bullet"" ? Give break close bars last summer again? Good point. Lockups instead lockdowns. want overwhelm hospitals. Two months lockups FlAtTeN CuRvE.  I'm sure anyone asks nurse, they'd respond either ""I did!"", ""that's privacy issue."" many office buildings working full staff? many people still working home? good. know surgery time get almost 2 years out. Flu shot one arm, Covid shot other. Every year on. Mark words. WFH also saves gas money time since commute. that‚Äôs hour (assuming commute least 30 minutes) day stuff time like productive things around house spend time family. It‚Äôs wanting talk people. It‚Äôs giving time back benefit life. typically would spot on, vaccine shown prevent transmitting covid exposed. vaccine recipient fight virus effectively, mean can't get infected can't spread it.

Not scientist, understanding. Wait, accidents happen home? get personal text messages Bill Gates telling he's depositing money account daily now. I've forwarded bank details, social security number mothers maiden name, getting pretty excited buy first house. Thank you. believe light end tunnel, media making seem like things matter variants. essentially excited SA found US. 

I'm disgusted journalism day age. lost best thing get ratings, they're still trying use last resort one cares anymore.  think pressure get vaccines try sell preventing hospitalizations severe illness. lot teachers unions saying safe schools right take vaccine, could see complaints coming solution offer vaccine (amoung professions trying get people back work place). TBH sounds like lot people reddit interested taking this, may worth release interest. can't see 100M people getting excited take efficiency. 

Right demand vaccines, higher risk populations get vaccinated end opposite. lot polls saying 50-65 percent people want vaccine (and thought offered 95% effective) available kids yet, could suplus months start getting quicker.   Yup. Every day top stories sub ""Pfizer deliver another 200 million doses States ahead schedule"" meanwhile local headlines ""Canada hit another delay Pfizer deliveries."" 

I love States finally competent administration want get vaccinated ASAP they've hit hard virus. time wish companies would keep commitments us. 1/10 population States, what's use skimping us couple million doses get vaccines America *slightly* faster? that's drop bucket sit freezer delivery outpaces administration. us would speed recovery months. Latinos mexican nothing it. Latinos used generalization. 

To influenced, don‚Äôt need control US health policy. public speaking platform. Even Canadians influenced dumb shit trump.

Besides, doesn‚Äôt mean need call moron. Getting someone see point view isn‚Äôt achieved insulting right bat. Check feelings door, little angry one. heard gave Shot. earth would think vaccine would interfere ability kids? evidence kind side effect other. I‚Äôm ok vaccines. friend died months ago. Single mom, restaurant server. Gonna difficult us ever blame restaurants community crying reopening whole time. see differently. murdered friend ours...because people needed happy hour break?  Well yeah, good. still something Pfizer announced results sure vaccine would work set bar approval 50% efficacy. 72% 85% prevention hospitalization death still great. Yup countries let vaccinated tourist=money. evidence adverse reactions vaccine anecdotal. logged analyzed. order life threatening reactions vaccine 1-2 million, even hard call ""life threatening"" - even acute allergic reactions well tolerated clinical environment interventions able applied quickly. 

Let try put alternative terms: today, 91 *million* doses administered, recorded death attributed vaccine acute reaction, evidence post-vaccination deaths attributable vaccine (this different saying ""no one died getting vaccine"" - expect many 80M+ primarily elderly people die within weeks vaccine sheer statistical chance). 

In words, right now, ""fatality rate"" Moderna Pfizer vaccines appears roughly 0 80 million.

Compare known fatality rate COVID ages 25-34: 50 per million. Still low, least far, 4,000 times higher vaccine death rate. ignores exogenous benefits others vulnerable. 

You right FDA provided full approval vaccine, value adding statement. tons FDA-approved drugs incredibly dangerous. silly example, Tylenol statistically far likely kill vaccine due low therapeutic dose LD-50 ratio due liver toxicity. Plenty FDA-approved cancer treatments fatality rates exceed 1%. 

Vaccines typically safe. low-dose, one time, high bar approval given healthy people. Even extremely unusual ""horror stories"" old vaccines long-term negative reactions single digits millions doses given - *still* significantly less death rate 24-35 year olds COVID. vaccines theoretically *safer* old vaccines mechanism action fact preservatives them. 

Not getting vaccine ""safe"" intellectually sound reasonable saying wear seatbelts theoretical scenario seatbelt could cause greater injury death. Except delta even greater actually true 1-2% accidents seatbelts cause damage worn. case, evidence appears point 0%. 

Think way: vaccine producing one tiny protein brief period time illicit immune reaction. substances vaccine completely harmless outside autoimmune response (they chemicals body either produces cells regularly consume). Compare getting COVID (or virus really): all-out biological war. Even asymptomatic infections result widespread cellular death inflammatory response. literally scenario imagine vaccine could even theoretically cause harm getting COVID itself. Apparently Pfizer vaccines going rest world (not US) come plant Belgium. US doses come plant Michigan. even though Canada right next door, vaccines supposed come Belgium supply held (a) plant upgrades (b) EU deciding want ship vaccines outside EU.

If US keeps good job increasing daily vaccinations I'm guessing point summer vaccines made Michigan start going countries outside US too. Gotta real mr mitch posts help stay sane sometimes Fuck China fuck defending them. plan.


There series action, reaction, back-pedaling, greed vying control awaited successful vaccines treatments.

Occasionally someone would wear mask gasping. leader democracy voluntarily pauses vaccination countries get vaccinated going lose next election. way happens. Americans strange personal freedom mantra keep going through. Yet, countries like Australia, New Zealand, real lock downs, fake hissy fit lockdowns leading world here. argument 'economy', really paying attention. Also malignant narcissist charge thing abandoned, blame y'all thinking lockdowns work given support. They‚Äôll fine Canada could probably set production one vaccines like AZ one. course, would've needed start 6 months ago.  Source? Otherwise, I'm grouping idiots signs saying ""Masks spread viruses!"" hang around government buildings hospitals. headline though really misleading, know people mean 'life normal'. Something appropriate would 'International travel return normal'. case vaccines. Walmart care dude walks chicken pox, never received chicken pox vaccine. idea nonstarter. Yep I‚Äôm idiot. mean pre covid world get stopped us boarder asked pot asked see cell phone facebook,ig, etc accounts passwords refused entry. friendly world. Covid roughed up. reason trials vaccines instead saying ""there's reason think thatnitnis dangerous.""  That's science public health works. say European successful efficient integration project bit easy, similar projects history world. EU working smoothly trade within union democratic process speed decision making severely lacking. EU population general even know control European government. could, would hard to. it‚Äôs big question probably wouldn‚Äôt it. found good study vaccine efficacy time post 2nd dose least take look chances are. I‚Äôll 2 weeks 2nd dose weekend I‚Äôm thinking, he‚Äôll 10 days. won‚Äôt mind coming teaching 100% in-person class full time. disabled vet news reads: disabled veterans likely get worst-possible vaccine 66% effectiveness.

We need ramp Pfizer Moderna production.

Probably half American population going ever get vaccinated. real option vaccines near 100% effectiveness covid good. 

Somewhere around 4 10 participants saw new immunity. fills dread damned well know shitty vaccine VA give it‚Äôs cheap really care.  saw worker supermarket, restocking, lowered mask, sneezed raise mask again. saw look looked blank.

I seen multiple staff members supermarket restock fresh produce mask mouth nose. disgusted way public behaving shops, hesitate blame employees, seriously, WTF?  stopped wearing cloths May wrap head shirts, pants, underwear, 18.5 masks, breath directly sanitation wipe boxes. NEVER CAREFUL HAHAHA I'M LIVING BEST LIFE HAHAHAHA NEW NORMAL...IF...ONLY...WE...WERE...LIKE...ASIA. said 100% effective hospitalization death. Maybe died 28 days? Awesome News!!!!! anti-vaxxers risking live/health everyone else‚Äôs too.

Yeah I'd said even putting mutations discourse That‚Äôs good, still don‚Äôt want covid long term effects though. do, question whether would invite folks wedding. think I‚Äôd 20 person wedding happy lmao  matters hospitalization death.

I dismiss potential long COVID symptoms either. guess hope vaccines reduce likelihood severity symptoms though. people reddit fairly intelligent Trump lying moronic sack dog turds. Ive vaccine. source? Ill say since must read comment. link provided said NOTHING vaccine side affects 100% immediate stated. ""source"" source all. exclusive Covid. Every viral infection potential leave sequels. take look professional athletes , many retired Covid? field issues? player collapsed? Something sadly rare soccer, no...we havent seen far, put LOT strain lungs heart.

I dismiss , dont let cloud judgment.  pre Maybe, one shot still better 0 individual, better society shots literally flushed away. still win-win. even 65+ yet. anybody know peak antibodies second moderna dose are? There's literally story here. got ""extra"" shot standby everyone else also received one. Big fucking deal. 70+? insane death rate outcome? suggestions increasing vaccine production two suppliers lot smart people tried really hard find ways pump failed far Glad you! 0-6?

This great result. long people aren‚Äôt dying, ending hospital, live normal lives again.  willpower lot's money üí∞ AFAIK that‚Äôs similar across adenovector vaccines. 
There minor variations, ofc, yeah. ~ -20...-18*C long term storage ~ -4...-8*C shorter lifespan.
It‚Äôs even possible freeze dry thing achieve +2...+8*C long term storage. That‚Äôs special form-factor Sputnik-V Far East Siberia. expensive production again, +2...+8 easily achievable conventional fridge, see technique already used rural Russia.
I mean, vaccination rates rural Russia rather bad moment. probably would much worse without it.
I hope technique used rural America too. Like Alaska external territories. Delivering Pfeizer might nightmare there, something like J&amp;J + AZD1222 probably makes sense there. somehow manage deliver actual mRNA faster, well, won‚Äôt hurt: hopefully people able annual boosts J&amp;J, assuming corona‚Äôs S-protein won‚Äôt mutate beyond recognition. hell rag get white listed? Good question seem thoughtful person, come conclusion, want (continue to) convince anything else. made fair point, think good thing everybody read source make mind.

Let add this: Nobody really intersted escalation whole issue. One could least regard something positive EC, documented section 5.4, viewed manufacturing sites UK equivalent located EU-27. can't really see hostility behind this. saying section 5.1 **explicitly** excludes UK plants however - admittedly happened conversation, parts discussion - may least disputable. 

Stay safe! it‚Äôs NY totally fucked. CA well. CNBC reporting participants J&amp;J vaccine trial, NONE went hospital NONE died vaccine.

I found bit odd. I‚Äôm seeing new heavy metal festivals booked Iowa summer. Get ready freedom zones pandemic zones... Many people COVID critically low oxygen levels (by medical standards) still feel ok. acceptable eu companies export vaccines israel/uk/canada, UK exporting EU somehow much? Oh, better source? opposite username don‚Äôt think left anti science? look anti-GMO propaganda. 

The right much worse. putting well sponsors disparity. circle jerk healthy r/news isn‚Äôt? think same. Surely appalling thing countries like uk us perfectly acceptable export vaccine, eu expected to? UK, US EU, eu country exporting vaccines. Make fucking billions small business gets kicked balls hard never recover? story every single day? Pharma rest billionaires make record profits beg scraps money? 
You deep ass can't even see bad is, bad first place. literally test subject. vaccines approved use, besides Pfizer Moderna. Canada better majority EU countries. bad country vaccine production, honest.  people trained administer shot, otherwise they'd tell everyone jab themselves

It's number people trained response anaphylaxis  lonely single right actually thankful deal roommates. can't imagine stress trying safe person breathing air flaunting precautions work outside home.   I‚Äôll look tomorrow way exhausted try dig several government websites. Especially since several weeks worth data missing one website would expect be. break media hysteria covid porn message: hey shit heads keeps hospital. Touchdown.

Possible turning point too. Instead wrapped every single infection realize problem severe disease. Fauci singing song day. Earlier week, Harris County, Texas (Houston), set online registration vaccinations. Anyone register, provide name, age, occupation, pre-existing conditions (if any), etc. Then, become eligible dose available you, notify 48 hours schedule appointment.

I like give much clearer idea many people want vaccine they‚Äôll better idea they‚Äôve run 1a 1b eligible wanted vaccine. Seriously obvious bet know say learnt micro macro evolution *""The Drift* introduce new work new ideas young writers yet absorbed media hivemind.""

What joke definitely high quality article. Irish guy here, government Dublin absolutely furious EU this, without notification use political football. idea vaccines produced Germany/Netherlands Belgium would shipped Ireland go Britain via Northern Ireland fantasy. latest Fauci. 1.0 hopefully gets vacation. Meh. I've seen Indiana Jones Last Crusade. Sure, immortality seems cool all, can't bring cup past great seal, plus still get kinda old looking anyway. right left anti-science mobs. right much worse. NZ problem affording vaccines, bought enough vax whole population twice already giving free vaccines Pacific Island countries. 

But vaccines bought doses AZ, J&amp;J Noravax. look likely low efficacy rate let us open borders. 

In NZ never outbreaks like countries. populace would accept low level community transmission. People totally freak single case makes quarantine. 90% populace vaccinated one mRNA vaccines would let us reopen border. already told take least early 2022. 

We getting enough Pfizer vax 750,000 people, think buy loads Moderna. ones use place like NZ single case considered disaster. Also sitting home nothing makes people feel noble empowered. dinosaurs also main reason restrictions first place since represent 80% hospitalizations deaths it‚Äôs interest old get vaccinated first end restrictions wont. None permanent. sustainable economically Newsom knows that. Governors really announce numbers restrictions end. think even Massachusetts wait *zero* infected hospitals lift restrictions, many acceptable? feeling \~ 90% effectiveness rates advertised would end actually case field. would take breath look actual facts studies variants ignore worrying hand wringing media.

I agree decision making process charge something worry about. California gone back forth enough grabbing onto certain specific statistics making ridiculous policy them.

I think actually end quite simple. at-risk population 65+ health conditions 12-15% total. vaccinated, probably vaccine, hospitalizations fatalities fall 80-90%. happens policy makers see hospitals finally back normal deaths dropping weeks think finally start think economics situation loosen restrictions. I'm OP agree lol xd Here‚Äôs thing. Almost nothing studied pregnant women. lot pregnancy categories drugs retrospection. truly don‚Äôt understand  don‚Äôt think people realize ridiculous unscientific California becoming, it‚Äôs beyond ‚Äúlockdown‚Äù states like New York. reason many us residents nervous public officials allowing us normalcy next months. always see expensive electronics airport vending machines. always wonder buys shit. Maybe it‚Äôs people EU blunder. agree ban exports Britain NI still mostly part SM. even back door illegal exports, numbers would negligible. affirm every day. days rough yes believe this.  Thankfully less restrictive state. ready friends vaccine also calm down. It‚Äôs hard seeing extroverted people kind paralyzed period time. want everyone chill lifestyle again.  alternate option then? Stay home miserable?

Btw, surprise surprise, wasn‚Äôt increase COVID cases linked Capitol Riots, plus Sturgis Motor Rally superspreader event debunked (it didn‚Äôt cause 250k cases). looks like they're sold now. Genuine question....does anyone know long vaccines last/protect us for? months years? Forever? going taking 2 doses every months rest lives?    hope USA wait couple months extra get mRNA vaccines. Otherwise luck. Please dont comment things dont understand can't waited? logic there. UK specifically blocks export vaccines. AZ contract states UK plants used EU deliveries UK allow exports. KN95 would OK, site order from? hope understand used term ""support staff"" include every employee directly involved providing medical care.

There 1000 moving parts hospital including complex machines devices. Even things ""out sight, mind"" like ventilation system far complicated normal.

By token, clerical staff go extra mile getting insurance companies pay really understand they're playing fair. missed original estimate (of Sept) several months UK, obviously missed deadline EU well. clearly overly optimistic initial estimates, manufactuers, best ramp complicated process quickly possible. Nobody wants vaccines late. actually quite easy defeat actually try. 

In short-term, maybe, long-term effect requires concentrated coordinated effort. false. false. false. allowing virus spread capacity exponentially increases chance mutation leave current vaccine completely useless.

additionally, N501Y mutation allows infect animals previously immune. thought mutation made contagious humans actually made contagious everything. study mice (previously completely 100% immune COVID), took couple months (maybe weeks) COVID mutate 100% harmless killing them.

even vaccinate, probably mutating reservoir animal population. resurface strong enough vaccines. cats specifically sensitive COVID think #1 point new outbreak could people outdoor cats. especially mice infected. Simple that. 

The UK banned export 100 medicines corona treatment nobody said boo. Why? normal thing do. scam. comes contractual issues. UK blocked anything. Effective catching COVID mild severe symptoms?  Shameful. teachers need vaccine. I'm tired states prioritizing fucking dinosaurs lived full lives rather teachers making active contributions society. doubt it. Valentine‚Äôs Day mostly people dining people within bubble (spouses SOs). travel, family mixing. Plus good part country indoor dining since last summer V vaccine approved anywhere far unknown works older people.

You see this? dangerous misinformation. Sorry, missed one. could even drugs used boost immun system new levels take drugs HIV patient higher Corona risk others according studies. Accept UK cannot block exports EU time expect EU fulfills deliveries UK. info could wrong, I'm going local reporting two local sources (I live Atlanta area). Moreover (according info seen) ""mass vaccination"" entire school district. implementing stand-by procedure would contact schools let know whenever leftover doses - almost every day. 

If different sources show something different, please post them. Could expand little? think UK government people done? looked KN95 masks? got big bag pretty easily. Yep, amongst last so. think sides understandable. That's thinking too. fact really two plans ive putting off, haircut finally eye appointment, goal wait 14 20 days, maybe even month New Year's case barber, clients, optometrist, assistants patients ""livin lahf"" huge family gatherings. think least April hopefully give cases chance slow down. Classic EU deflection really. They're playing politics know bad looks UK vaccinated rate that's 10x faster slow-walked entire process. Georgia near bottom. original issue numbers providers reporting doses given. We‚Äôve given almost 70% current allotment well outpacing weekly supply. Hmm hard time imagining UK struggling ban Pfizer vaccines. AstraZeneca one, super reliable much better terms practicality storage distribution. Also, first place order Novavax vaccines, guaranteed first 60 million doses, coming soon. Novavax vaccines also produced UK.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Certainly appears room lower cost, could production investment

"" Q: AstraZeneca said vaccine made available cost price. different strategy competitors. What's thinking behind strategy?

It's strategy, commitment.

The price around 2.50 euros ($3) per dose. main subject agreement Oxford, order able provide vaccine widest possible population, equitable conditions access possible.

We committed three billion doses cost price 2021. must forget race virus rather race vaccine Yeah, we'll see. I'm holding breath AZ; think Novavax J&amp;J younger people receiving; American companies. know US block order, we've purchased ton vaccines, know means. I'm tired, man. I've living Groundhog Day almost year, living considering actions super closely Covid. hospital admission criteria. Hospitals severely stress, accept people high risk dying left alone.

There many people dire situation, dying, thus get 15% severe cases hospitalizations. Hope CA soon also... AZ deserve criticism sure, far appears issue AZ actually triggered telling EU factories output soon enough. Late ordering, signing poor contract, fabricating trade/vaccine war UK distraction, triggering international issue breaking article 16... That's EU. People agree lockdowns it‚Äôs idea vaccines useless that‚Äôs earning downvotes.

Even efficacy isn‚Äôt want terms preventing disease, it‚Äôs still unbelievably effective preventing severe disease death, people care Novavax recombinant protein vaccine. impression would easiest mRNA **and recombinant protein** vaccines (that is, Moderna, Pfizer/BioNTech, Pfizer) Yes definitely normal. AZ say Belgium months behind even six months deliveries much lower agreed. That's acceptable without valid explanation. Selfish... mean like inventing vaccine releasing details create multiple nations free. Making sure said vaccine sold production cost. kind selfish? 5.1 plainly says AZ's obligation use BRE deliver initial doses manufacturing EU (which purposes include UK). simply that's try best do. There's nothing clause obliges deliver initial doses manufacturing outside EU (although equally could wanted complied rest contract, obliged to).

5.4 separately obliges use BRE establish manufacturing capacity UK EU vaccine generally. refers initial optional doses. There's nothing 5.4 creates obligation deliver doses UK, establish manufacturing capacity.

So logical way reconcile two 5.4 setting manufacturing capacity totality potential orders contract (e.g. including optional doses). 5.1 delivering initial doses. Seems envisaged initial doses supposed come EU manufacturing capacity, maybe UK manufacturing capacity gets used line fulfill optional additional doses. Yeah Minnesota Wisconsin too. peak mid-November started go wasn‚Äôt affected thanksgiving Christmas/New Years. That‚Äôs don‚Äôt really buy holidays caused recent wave. It‚Äôs like don‚Äôt celebrate Christmas Midwest lol. think virus comes goes waves wave California happened holidays. pandemic going year now, still able purchase N95 mask anywhere. get cheap surgical masks.

1 year global pandemic, STILL manufacturing capacity produce enough N95 masks? going on? sounds kinda poopy. think 80% + go for. wrong?

Spoiler alert: trial population essential workers US one could afford get hospitalised. SA trials AZ, Janssen Novavax lower efficacy. least AZ can't due new variant.

"" 72 percent effective protecting moderate severe illness United States""

We deep shit current society. Yes, 80-90% protection 21 days after, study long protection lasts, hence booster. No, doesn‚Äôt mean all. I'm OC county, office downtown LA. Almost friends bay area, family LA county. even though I'm ""open"" county, social structure pretty locked down. seem fine way awhile... corona level dagdrinking hangover. broadly 1 say ""if produce UK 5.4 delivery must therefore occur UK"". There's nothing says implies contract 5.1 still contains BRE obligation deliver.

On 2, AZ UK seen agree obligation give first 100m doses produced UK UK. Yes seen contract one seems disputing reason believe that's true. think even trying dispute true using BRE would require AZ breach it.

Simply production screw Belgium mean violated BRE fact try best. BRE actually defined quite low bar given AZ effectively 3 months set huge vaccine production infrastructure EU. Given every vaccine production programme similarly sized companies fairly major hiccups delays far, BRE defined definitely quite low bar. see, 78% figure one analogous effucacy results vaccines, right?

50,4% virus them, 78% symptoms 100% severe symptoms?  another year mean high enough 7-day incidence able go back normal. I‚Äôd love live Denver honestly. best snowboarding planet, teams four major leagues, beautiful scenery, far places like SLC vegas Meet friends around Europe Rome.

Well, slightly. Oh yes baby shove vaccine arm  summer wave.

Which summer wave? first wave? one ended locking entire country greatly reducing mobility? second small wave served seeding period large third wave? third wave ended decrease mobility increased mask usage. know this? holiday increase cases accompanied increase mobility. California decrease cases holiday surge. wave peaked December 21st started dropping December 31st. immunity factor rather mobility, surge cases caused holiday, resulting second peak. 

If Manaus, Brazil reach herd immunity, there's little chance California did, especially everything explained changes mobility.  Still time, have! Yes happen too. Masks permanent end year largely forgotten. lol

covid already shows 6 ""major"" variants, year.
With accelerated mutation expected multiple variants found patients.
In europe, south america instance, patients tested found 2 variants time.
This deemed increase mutation chances big way.
Certenly so, whith large world population still fresh infect.
7 billion people.
Imagine long take vaccinate 1 billion people.
By time, ever, surely 6 variants, 20. CDC currently estimates 2020, 1 every Covid cases reported. 

LA county reported 1,104,393 Covid cases. CDCs calculation applied, could assume 5.08 million residents Covid. 

With population 10.04 million, that‚Äôd half. 

Now, we‚Äôre really fast loose applying CDC‚Äôs countrywide estimate LA, might well testing, certainly recent surge rest country throughout 2020. But, illustrate significant portion region already Covid. Add 790k doses vaccine administered, you‚Äôre well way good chunk population kind immunity. That‚Äôs stupid. professional like many airports. US ever extreme lockdown? Japanese for: Duh fake science real? fear study also fake single person actually died virus /s don‚Äôt believe obesity complicating factor? Looks like good news! Preventing deaths important part. ambulance them...that's enough proof me. Thanks. I'll look it. Good question lol nobody wants 60 %. 95% bust. convergent evolution possible simaliar strains evolved multiple locations? constraint evolution virus possible? Source? prefer moderna Pfizer. I've seen movie    People need stop listening Fauci. hard time seeing Swedish-British company ignore European market put bets dysfunctional US Great realistically slow-ass rollout gonna haunt us large city, capacity, unless need ICU virtual hospital care. get admitted.

This essentially whole country, though everyone lucky home support available. [Yes, people definitely ignoring good 85% severe infections 100% hospitalizations deaths. That‚Äôs frustrating thing. many states countries shown small effort part citizens, managed. 

Just insane selfish *refuse* anything. won't, nobody wants Ok amount vaccines enough entire U.S. adult population June, soon expect get vaccines people's arms? Nice knows reopen state soon allow certain industries resume economy collapse vaccine effectiveness not. He's complete idiot. Yes. received placebo offered real vaccine. Fair enough can't medical pregnancy reasons. doubts anti vax though. Virtually anti vaxxers apart insane David Icke/Alex Jones types say ""it developed quickly"". LOL like college would that. fly ate guy. suppose depends define ""long COVID"". [this 18% people long COVID hospitalized COVID-19, 66% impairment least one organ system 25% multi-organ impairment. 

People hospitalized likely develop long COVID likely experience severe long COVID, still make small minority total long COVID cases. I'm making argument.

It's odd conflate something like pro life/choice better healthcare system helps people stay date health.

Anyway, indeed take umbrage idea 'mandatory health screenings,' understand coming from. Aka maybe hahahaha There‚Äôs discrepancy there. Vaccines don‚Äôt long term effects don‚Äôt show within couple months. we‚Äôve seen short term effects already, didn‚Äôt last long. 

We absolutely keep cases better vaccines, testing, kinds things invented. Look countries affected it. You‚Äôre acting like it‚Äôs guarantee everyone infected matter seriously doubt that. I‚Äôm saying keep everything shut combination many things keep people infected. Why? infrastructure still there. wait bit. Lower mutation rate? There's least half dozen significance last six months. Oh that's even depressing would know I‚Äôm remembering earliest predictions last January, said cases would grow 50% every day out.

Folks saying would food shortages (in US) riots last February March, good idea stock up.

Martial law predictions. Higher folks work actually predicted one well

The need hundreds thousands ventilators subsequent panic buy/manufacture March...

Predictions 40+ million dead late summer, hospitals massively overwhelmed without draconian lockdowns lasted perpetually

A vaccine taking potentially 18-24 months March

Was really pessimistic corner internet early 2020? der frisst der teufel fliegen. would get JNJ it‚Äôs 8x less effective moderna Pfizer? Yikes. Gonna thing Levi Stadium. Hours waiting.  US good developing producing medicine

We develop 50% medicine earth

Canada meanwhile zero domestic vaccine production Thank enabling click bait variants take dramatically original strain already contagious?

Is sheer amount new cases actually competing original strain lowering infection rate? would placing responsibility children instead protecting vaccinate could actually get problems catching virus. Summer, Fall, Winter.

A lot people optimistic parts am. 

Israel still clocking 6500+ cases. 

Apparently new variants ready take leave current vaccines dust.

I believe ends. US production capacity 

We develop 50% world's medicine Eliminate possibility going hospital... Get stabbed J&amp;J!!!!!!!!!

Get that, get Pfizer Moderna available.

J&amp;J turns rattle snake garden snake. 100,000 cases daily US end summer. 500,000 US deaths June alone. early modeling catastrophically awful know enough virus point media still ran it

then weirdo Medium kept posting article article US would completely collapse hit 100k cases/day, full-scale collapse five years away fault obsessed freedom. i'm still getting spammed newsletter despite trying unsubscribe like ten times changed. Lower testing explained fewer people getting tested flights visiting grandma. area appointments available anywhere within 30 miles. Yes, mostly suspect study become unblinded within next three four months, anticipate able get vaccine regular channels. Oh god rabies horrifying disease. remember video YouTube watched someone dying rabies. 

*Spoiler alert: graphic video shows man deteriorating dying bitten wolf infected CDCs estimate nationally also 1/3 Americans Covid. LA average city regard. concerned people parties spreading virus other? Interesting thing children US seem problems virus children countries rarely problems Glad you‚Äôre calling cuz early pandemic. ‚Äúchest aches‚Äù ‚Äúhigh‚Äù body temperatures realized reactions anxiety LMAOO!! likey prevents asymptomatic transmission extent. Even pfizer moderna probably block most, all, asymptomatic transmission. experts say still wear mask vaccination, help unvaccinated around üò∑ one shot one opportunity Global post. city lol. Oh yeah. know city Fuck, honestly think people anymore. whole year get right still utterly blowing it. Share love. 33%? LA County total like 1.1 million COVID cases population like 10 million. Maybe figure lot people asymptomatic mild symptoms get tested. high risk 7 year old? Ahhhh thats right. forgot heard 90 days norm could catch again. headline marketer's wet dream. European country from? Hopefully one many also participated colonization... tbf think people realized load shit Pfizer started enrolling phase 3 july Good, enjoy getting vaccines vaccinate tens millions really like tech mRNA. Stability molecule problem prone transcription errors, thus cold storage, works phenomenal. really looking forward report really allows us evaluate efficacy two methods beyond laboratory settings. J&amp;J cost effective right now, part short term component ramping production covering capital costs. Well, least that's somewhat better expected. would nice knew whether getting vaccinated (with covid vaccine) prevents transmitting people. I'd feel terrible got vaccinated ended passing covid someone else without knowing it. didn‚Äôt plan, right miss something? plan buy vaccines unless revelation trump actually something. Maybe covid taskforce? trump didn‚Äôt shit would wrong attach name covid plan except plan. Damnit example lol!! people takes things literal? seen id hope true. something like Olympics look forward post-pandemic feel like would really boost morale everywhere. always symbol unity bringing people together. Moderna‚Äôs partnered Lonza. It‚Äôs like went nobody. ""my body, choice"" congruent making people go doctor...how? Yeah CNN says trump plan plan. Agreed. going achieve many people US don‚Äôt want take vaccine. read article said 60% Americans don‚Äôt want get vaccinated. Dr Fauci says need 75-85% vaccinated achieve herd immunity. someone else waiting lungs couldn‚Äôt get guy selfish prick defied stay home orders? Got it.. Well, election, thanksgiving, christmas new year back-to-back. amplified spread previous mass-gathering event.

Those kinds events kind come natural close now. Ok want us say dumb? bold strategy cotton. prefer them.

Which happy astrazeneca one got clinical trial that‚Äôs like 62 percent effective. havnt gotten sick. wouldn‚Äôt mattered. all. You‚Äôre falling shit they‚Äôre ones telling would mattered. wouldn‚Äôt have. They‚Äôre playing rhetorical game you. Fuck them. 

Is anyone seriously claiming duped thinking masks aren‚Äôt effective transmission infectious diseases? 2020? one public health statement? n standard usage century? serious. 


And actually, weren‚Äôt even wrong! Even now, one claims masks particularly effective keeping getting sick exposed. consistent original statement. it‚Äôs still true. reincorporated public health recommendation realized effective limiting range infected person project virus. eventual recommendation part ‚Äúflattening curve‚Äù strategy. strategy used masks paired social distancing keep spread rate overwhelmed emergency rooms. masks doesn‚Äôt stop getting virus, allow lower degree social distancing would required without them. That‚Äôs absurd cloth masks acceptable. don‚Äôt serve function preventing wearer getting it. limit distance exhales. reach emergency room capacity, increase social distancing. Remember that? That‚Äôs context masks ever recommended for. eligible I'm worried I'll offered J&amp;J AZ. Would lose place line hold Pfizer Moderna? depends variant. 

Right now, Variant south africa appears evade immunity acquired natural infection quite well. 

Prior infection wild type likely provide degree protection B117 (uk), although studies needed. vaccines, however, appear respond quite well. mean private businesses turning $$$ required turn down? holding breath one Well, wasn‚Äôt constitutional storm capital bombs, are. extended symptoms highly correlated severe disease. yet evidence observed ""heart/lung problems"" resolve matter way patient suffering symptoms. upset concerned. think won‚Äôt able get second vaccine I‚Äôm super upset. I‚Äôm Alabama run Moderna vaccines. Seriously idea me... get J&amp;J comes fine? 

Probably dumb worry job gall give first dose us didn‚Äôt save seconds knows long protected.  Though mom okay, baby might okay either... it‚Äôs something actually common. Go ask r/covid19, studies said organ damage happened lot mild/asymptomatic cases, retracted debunked. find much sub, actually research evidence based.

Look Dr. Darrel Francis‚Äô Twitter feed too, he‚Äôs picked apart bunch stuff, he‚Äôs cardiologist Imperial College London. remember PA estimated hit 20k+ Covid cases point, top highest peak saw little 10k cases. live Oregon/Washington apparently 

Last year busiest I‚Äôve seen hiking trails national parks since I‚Äôve moved hospitalizations severe side effects general. 

It‚Äôs stupid mindset way he‚Äôs thinking. 60,000 dollars much much closer 100,000 zero dollars. get test anyway. probably even cost less insurance. benefit employment starting certain day (e.g. 1st day employment 60 days employment, etc.), would guess covered insurance retroactively even paperwork messed up. Good luck. really think people wearing unnecessarily many masks reason still covid? plan then? More, even. US 300M doses Pfizer Moderna order, delivered end summer. vaccine get? want vaccine- Johnson Johnson  Apes apart weak. Apes together strong.  think science says respiratory virus spread? teleports? Kinda like PB&amp;J myself. Help! misremembering first people say Moderna vaccine one shot? clearly remember hearing/getting told Moderna vaccine one compared 2 like Pfizer. mom remembers way too. position change always 2 dose beginning? 

Again makes sense mom remember people saying Moderna 1 even convo ""hoped"" would get Moderna im like, ""mom everyone hopes that."" bothering im hoping someone clear hopefully confirm im crazy hearing things, im searching everything says 2 doses clearly remember one ago. Yes. species humans naturally selected out.

Not dumb humans. whole species. wife didn‚Äôt, around 40 mins. works everyone there, could infected monday Tuesday. showed symptoms Wednesday.... me, feel fine waiting PCR results. think meant number ppl affected variants outnumber ppl affected original strain. Moderna hard storage either since go regular freezer. That‚Äôs what‚Äôs Chicken pox mild children dangerous adults know effect still disease causing organ damage even mild sickness. really hope OK. chance eat drink anything there? want vaccine Dr Faucci got elected officials. much expect us take Johnson Johnson vaccine isn‚Äôt proven tackle new variants? Seems like thee. wait Oh, y'all mean rest us peasants douchebag covid denying politicians already done got theirs? Dude even fucking say it. üßê want vaccine Dr Faucci got elected officials. much expect us take Johnson Johnson vaccine isn‚Äôt proven tackle new variants? Seems like thee. wait Apparently 72% agree want Pfizer Moderna J&amp;J unless get use J&amp;J bridge.  got month, it‚Äôs already make 10% sequencing UK.

I think misreading - saying 10% SA variant sequences found anywhere found UK, 10% sequences found UK SA variant.

Add fact UK carries half entire world's COVID sequencing, 10% becomes bit less impressive. *absolute* number SA variant sequences found UK 70. large increase mental health issues concerning though. teen. It‚Äôs really bad. dying vine home. think J&amp;J goal 1B doses year ramp up. Half committed low income probably awhile reaches 1 billion mate... understand last year? also looking second dose boost efficacy prefer j&amp;j 18/16, whatever age limit vaccines? also get appointments. can‚Äôt imagine many people know made appointment don‚Äôt go. vials thrown away. one going lock house wear masks everywhere another year reason. know I'm fully vaccinated I'm resuming life normally can. know NZ it?

They paid everyone stay home.

It cost less paying them. JNJ still prevents death 100% time chances catching going extremely low spread stops well. Looks like vaccines also limiting spread well.

Every *five*? I'm thinking right timeline cautiously optimistic about. 

I've seen commenters state we'll need boosters *this year*, put us back March '20 we'll playing Pandemic *Groundhog Day* ad infinitum. I‚Äôm interested J&amp;J vaccine though.  archive version get around paywall: Absolutely! High fevers first trimester (first 12 weeks) cause harm baby, studies showing increase risk miscarriage. animal studies showing heart defects fetus well.  


So yes- reason want COVID! 65% variants South Africa, effective general strains. case severe COVID sickness reduced 85% death potential also greatly reduced still extremely positive. Seems like people dunking concerned mild/asymptomatic infections cause heart lung problems. I've yet see anything suggest still huge problem J&amp;J vaccine little resolve. reasonable expect people go ""back normal"" shot allows significant risk ""mild"" infection? Awesome news truly end nightmare need make sure entire world vaccinated variants spread around globe! Yes, always can.
But month dealth succesfully, better chance detecting early, fighting fast, lets say, 12 months later. 1 shot 60ish% good enough 2 companies 2 shot versions 90+% effective? GSK/Sanofi

Didn't essentially put development Trump literally signed order vaccines made US would stay US, order vaccines would spread across world right now, that's every country world except US/UK Israel low vaccination numbers.

If that's part plan dont know is. I'm american say I'm ""dumb conservative"" pls article mean J&amp;J vaccine alone Change presidents.  2 weeks later. Coronavirous gone.

I even thinking [region extended family live. area Belgium 1/10 population much public transport towns. Vaccination clinics town 2,000 people would pretty resource intensive. Pushing local governments pharmacies seems like would considerably easier. read memo bc that‚Äôs says.

Cheyenne! found feeling pessimistic today J&amp;J numbers. get vaccinated want one 95% effective ones. I'm worried option me. honestly made freak little bit. Could used rich pharmaceutical companies let it. Except it‚Äôs politicians, learned long ago scapegoating grandstanding keep job wrong. countries already signed contracts EU companies based EU position vaccines would blocked. Hundreds millions invested went manufacturing plants within EU, instead manufacturing said countries.

This literally theft EU. We're exact situation except 3 6 year old. I'm really looking forward continuing remote learning home, right safest option since husband immunosupressants.

We've staying home almost year now, want kids husband get vaccinated (and myself, I'm lower priority wait) finally get back living slightly normally again. 

It would suck everything ""right' lower risks community kids us get sick 11th hour right vaccines available all. whoopsie doodles years learn long term virus side effects popping left right kids can't sports heart lung damage whatever.

Already 3 year old's preschool saying remote option next fall, kids can't get vaccinated then...I guess we're screwed. either learn execute homeschool curriculum gets lose much needed educational experience. risking it. unless community spread comes significantly.

I want kids safe. want husband safe. Absolutely let's vaccinate highest risk groups first feeling we're going hit certain threshold vaccines one two groups people everyone else going say fuck open everything remove less risky options families like mine still waiting, leaving us shitty choices. hope get safety information younger kids quickly fall wayside risk adults taken care of.  Podcast Milwaukee...lmfao  fucking stupid. someone symptoms already decided they're headed airport going pay test themselves?! what? Head back home?
Ontario, Canada, announced mandatory (free) testing international arrivals $750 fine refuse test.

It‚Äôs unfortunate rely companies ultimately make decision resources available. really tired, sick spent day bathroom. hear second shot worse. tried find real information symptoms people really hard find one gives trusted information. husband parents side effects all. really unlucky? Globally jeez could since unfortunately poorer countries likely get mass vaccinations 2022 even later. wealthier nations within year likely. Israel probably see noticeable impact cases say March maybe given they're fastest vaccinations. UK/US probably next ones maybe sometime summer. EU countries probably months later maybe end year Canada simply going slow vaccinations currently is. Although things could always speed significantly speed timeline them. week virology  Hospitals serious stress accepting people in-patients would die left alone. Thus get 15% severe hospitalized cases. non-pandemic setting even moderate cases would 96 gives criteria defining cases Loud background noise louder conversation droplets higher risk. region (Ontario, Canada) banned loud music resturants reason, Japan put recommendations speaking public transportation (though culture pretty quiet begin with) feel lucky live America reason. 

I‚Äôve locked NYC year. It‚Äôs way live. Florida‚Äôs free unremarkable number deaths per million, compared states locked down. I‚Äôm heading soon lease up. It‚Äôs lowbrow, boring, repetitive hell.

Basically like living Alabama. love Tyler Perry. gives much back world. hope so. 9-year-old disabilities medically vulnerable immune compromised. 2-year-old brother haven‚Äôt contact kids since Feb 2020. breaks heart. Herd immunity would reassuring, can‚Äôt really relax gets vaccine. It‚Äôs weird people think they‚Äôre feeling ‚Äúlong covid‚Äù mind soup like rest hell world already explained. J&amp;J data, ""moderate severe case"" one patient least two symptoms, e.g., cough headache. vaccine 85% effective preventing cases. ""mild case"" one one symptom.   There‚Äôll still panicky anxious 20-somethings claiming long Covid forgot Gmail login though. comparing eating meat vaccine ? long term side effects eating meat known lol. little rushed,All trials still open, fully approved fda yet. age I‚Äôll take chances. get vaccine yea sure. Right Now? Hell noooo would agree. behind curve danger potentially chasing virus years come. depends wait. wait day, week, even month, would wait better vaccine. probably wait year. said, point, think would actually prefer traditional vaccine versus mRNA vaccine new. Frankly, lot faith stats coming Israel. ‚ÄúBoy lot rights let take something never ended‚Äù It‚Äôs quite debate teachers vs elderly sub past days get vaccines first. seem favor elderly since it‚Äôs quicker distribute vaccines compared groups. lot ageism occurred people seem think teachers 20s 30s wait turn.

I think teachers given priority, return classroom vaccination. teachers unions still balking don‚Äôt want come back children vaccinated, absurd. likely backlash teachers.

I‚Äôm worried there‚Äôs going lot deep resentment amongst different groups last well pandemic with. NZ suffer actually done right thing eliminating virus? paid heavy price get now. 

The US Europe hoarding vaccines, even expected start vaccinating general public least July here. hold Pfizer could well longer that. great news. Brought tears eyes. Potentially dumb Q: flu mutates more, (as far I‚Äôm aware) one main strain year, far there‚Äôs like Brazil, SA, UK strains Covid?  Dammit, well guess means politicians hospital CEO's officially vacation options now... Jealous? go Super Bowl every year! call NFL Draft... good. Moderna said we're working one already. yh theres chance may see booster shots new variant later year. mRNA variants eqsier adjust understand also took less year get vaccines out. We've vaccinated people state California.  Must working. good news CVS finish vaccination program nursing homes February. They'll distributing vaccines that. Walmart Walgreens start day now. (My local Walgreens says early next week.) pharmacy chains involved too. J&amp;J vaccine, regular doctor's offices store administer shots there's special storage requirement. projecting stuff, know label anything dislike ""russian""? Even go entire reddit history literally first time I've mentioned Russia context vaccine manufacturing companies delays. AZ deliveries UK 2020 30% promised.

These normal times effort set manufacturing production rushed, obviously introduces delays. definitely respect opinion, think reading much vigilance- we've advised since February. Festival season toast :( think usually false negatives rapid tests yh theres small chance could change. always good get lab test double check think going separate ways little common ground found. fight semantics along everything else. 

Anyway, glad California swing. Yes, lose tiny bit effectiveness electrostatic charge wears off, unless intubation patient going big enough difference matter. That‚Äôs playing smart That's fair. time, know pandemic going induce much change problems society facing since this. see masks public, honestly much address anything. üò¨ Glad got Pfizer version then. don‚Äôt care low effectiveness. Swiss cheese model won‚Äôt really benefit much kind number. once, left headphones car saw Best Buy kiosk airport. Bought nice noise canceling headphones use trip returned Best Buy got home lol Yes.

This still very, good news back March whenever reported, number still comparable influenza. Epidemiologists made big deal 1/2 mutation rate influenza massively better like 10x mutation rate influenza.

The way redditors talk (""much lower mutation rate"" ""covid nothing Influenza comes mutating"") inaccurate weighting. mutation rate still close order magnitude much comparable.

At time we're unlikely getting yearly booster shots ""for decades"". looking like every year now, unlikely go decades. Even one vaccine dose year whatever strain manages successfully achieve immune escape become epidemic still cause level damage (its somewhat unlikely it'll even deadly unvaccinated people since mutations necessary achieve immune escape probably come cost overall fitness -- aka virus evolve less severe).

We could probably get vaccinated year virus would turn common cold virus quickly without even boosters (I'm still getting booster shots become available though).

Will accept prayers! Finish replenish, baby. Let‚Äôs go!  TwO wEeKs FlAtTeN CuRvE  means thing high demand! U.S. U.K. **invested seven times per capita** upfront EU research development procurement. EU invest heavily. invested almost order magnitude less UK US.

But incompetence causes delays, instead owning bad decisions lash like child.  ‚Äúfreedom‚Äù never stop completely, weeks, begin with, people followed ‚Äúthe steps‚Äù like wearing masks, maintaining social distance, etc.

The problem people dumb and/or selfish follow ‚Äúthe steps‚Äù. 

That continue problem well year - even people getting vaccinated.

This far nuanced simply getting vaccine. don‚Äôt data definitely reduce/prevent permanent damage virtue immune systems work. immune system primed disease, exposed immune reaction much measured. lot perma damage seems immune reaction.  UK everyone trying avoid - hoard vaccines rich. Filthy trash colonizers remain filthy trash colonizers. agree overall sentiment still cognizant ‚Äúnot dying immediately‚Äù isn‚Äôt end-all-be-all eliminating safeguards.

You ‚Äúnot die‚Äù getting COVID still serious long-term damage. Take vitamins one simple way get lots people take vaccines, I'm surprised nobody figured out: Add provision current COVID relief bill everyone gets vaccinated receives check $300, right hospital. helps solve economic problem COVID greatly increase turn vaccines already second shot. need Johnson Johnsonto latch Thanks explanation.

Though given 65+ main group protected, might expected made effort gather data directly bear age group rather rely extrapolating younger healthier people. Virgin NY mask mandates, lockdowns, high depression rates vs. Chad FL mask mandates, lockdowns, good economy, low depression rates.   variant going cause another wave vaccines fully distributed. whole world needs vaccinated otherwise variants parts world infect impact fully innoculated Americans. 
 
The moderna jab less efficacious South African variant, JNJ jab. need move vaccines faster racing variant waves otherwise come. enough mutation even antibodies prior infection safe.

Anyway bit dishonest. ban exports. checks make sure shortages excuses make money. EU stupid, bit trusting times. matter? Nobody wants shitty vaccine though. There's rational reason worried mRNA stuff. proven safe effective. Stop giving pseudoscience. Good, hiking trails national parks open! Minimal risk compared indoors, provides enormous mental health benefits help us weather vastly important COVID restrictions. That‚Äôs meta. Developed country here- Korea.

We sitting fingers ass government order Moderna Pfizer vaccines early enough literally everyone refuses take Russian Chinese vaccines... obviously, trust Russia China controls safety measures expect US EU. He's downvoted he's right. take look stats find google. country's mortality rate deaths per 100k population.

Brazil 105 (223k deaths 211m people)

US 132 (436k deaths 328m people)

Italy 145 (87k deaths 60m people)

Same data corresponds mortality analysis John Hopkins (UK leads worst mortality rate 155) Yes should, even already one variant, still might able pick different variant unique mutations, antibodies might able defend new variants since *just* different enough confuse established antibodies recognize virus encountered before. 200 different strains common cold, get one immediately another. AFAIK, new mRNA vaccines utilize ""spike protein"" found surface virus essentially gives cells instructions fight one variant virus, certain extent crown structure virus distinguishing feature variants possess one key features vaccines engineered target. spike protein ""projected"" neighboring cells, helps immune system produce antibodies train neutralize virion (the infectious particle virus) becomes full blown infection. taking Benadryl now. contact doctor morning gets worse. Thank Yes  66% effective J&amp;J vaccine OK, enough fully stop spread disease contagious go back business usual.  got vaccine would still want Pfizer vaccine later. Evenly participators

EU, UK, Canada, Israel, Switzerland BBC European countries. 

This phase one. Till summer No, NZ isolated island. think table tweet explains 5000 18-64 year olds control vaccinated groups, 300 65+, enough data particular study calculate efficacy 65+.

In 65+ groups, 1 got infected calculated efficacy group effectively meaningless: Since control group 6% smaller, resulted calculated efficacy 6%, 95% confidence interval -1400% 94% (e.g. 95% confident vaccine makes 14 times likely get infected 17 times less likely)

By contrast, 18-64 group 29 infections vaccinated group 100 control, resulting efficacy 71% 95% confidence range 56% 81%. government to, likely. Private businesses tend look reputations. super spreader event Disneyland would make Disneyland look awful would really lower number visitors. So, perfectly reasonable expect Disneyland 1) take precautions prevent spread putting alcohol hand wash everywhere 2) may even end requiring proof vaccination enter.

I'm betting airlines end similar. entire business model *relies* people believing safe fly. hope so. plans moving state last year ended putting hold virus. want return normal life. lol words, masks actually work? Yeah, J&amp;J vaccine stinks comparison. Right? would guess yes based products mentioned check products. infrastructure isn‚Äôt distribute it. problem currently having. Trump plan year Biden‚Äôs team make something vaccinate population.  Thanks. didn‚Äôt know Yeah, I‚Äôm we‚Äôre fully functional able enormous amount vaccines... them. don‚Äôt want feds coming taking operation. I‚Äôm sure community would super trusting that.  dropped half (52%) adults said trust president's vaccine **comments**

You're god damn right trust vaccine *comments*, trust goddamn word came mouth **I observed clearly obviously lying face daily**. everything! Everything. KMac Spicy Press Sec Week. 

It never Trump's vaccine. nothing vaccine development. absolutely nothing one former 44 presidents done, basically shell money loosen regulations around one specific vaccine.

He worthless, bro. terrible. objective fact well half country. less half country, maybe one dividing internet. ""Two weeks flatten curve."" Apparently purely political vendetta within New York State politics.
The NY AG trash. Sounds rational. principle, yes soon body interacts mrna start making neutralizing antibodies, effect likely immeasurable immediately. would fully expect steep curve something like .5% effective day 1, 1% effective day 2, 1.5% day 3 2% day 4, 4 % day 5 example reaches full potential somewhere around 14-21 day mark first dose. issue data I'm purely speculating I'd bet anything would find type effect, opposed sudden 80% effectiveness jump day 14 think everyone expected phase 3 take least year people kept saying normally 5 year process something. boils this. people want schools back open, vaccinate educators. way we'll go back. Moderna already cutting back amount they‚Äôre sending Canada, lot. mean, dude...I‚Äôm going fake something put ahead people actually need me. That‚Äôs works I'm doctor possible guess. can't see allergic reaction would take long.

I'm allergic antibiotics takes days allergy build that's I'm taking antibiotics 3 times day. allergy also stops within day stopping taking them.

Maybe talk doctor? See think. Antihistamines work reduce swelling. starts feeling breathless like throat swelling, needs medical help. Honestly know lot athletes compete level really struggling drawn cycle. Preparing event may may happen, basically international competition last year. know still competing level would done it. sucks. wish known would also protect long-hauler stuff. People get often mild initial symptoms. live Australia one relative lives Vietnam. reason feel luckier.  D614G evidence iffy though. probably improvement fitness, also argued simply D614G colonized Italy hence rest Europe hit NYC took America. D614 strain shut Wuhan hopped Seattle got lucky locked early severity outbreaks rest USA [viral] population effects could caused us import D614G exported D614 D614 ""lost"".

Similarly I'm super convinced variant evidence date. weird I'd accept variant increased transmission virulent mediated increased viral replication. first came said increased transmission, increased viral load virulent. said increased transmission increase viral load virulence. increased transmission increased virulence increased viral load. I'm still waiting three light time convincing evidence pointing direction. highly politically convenient.

But ""short term"" mutations sliding along original fitness curve trying boost R0 emerging herd immunity. since there's something like 20 epitopes spike protein alone sum total mutations really achieve immune escape vaccines point R0 goes 1.0 come overall cost fitness. would weird achieved immune escape somehow ""got better"" time. ? much difference  pandemic gone June 2021. that, sold cost anymore What‚Äôs new? limiting supply vaccine, accepting distribution schedule,, allowing time mutations, profit unconscionable. Really? That‚Äôs used think, seeing badly ball dropped, I‚Äôm starting expect young/healthy people won‚Äôt getting August :/ look like Mrs Clause AFAIK mRNA vaccines use PEG many cosmetics, toothpaste etc. people get antibodies PEG. happen use stuff contains PEG? I'm talking prospects new mutations extending pandemic reducing effectiveness vaccines. everyone got shot (which current rates long shot) stopped social distancing businesses opened good, August September zero hospitalizations go insane again. That's big deal.

Ultimately we'll get thing booster combo shots (I'm fear mongering) timeline razor thin happen Fall like said might turn another full year lockdown world. rationalizing see won‚Äôt change fact deadly disease dangerous us cannabis vending machines widespread yet unfortunately  agree. hope people 20s 30s go J&amp;J leave Pfizer/Moderna older folks.

I sure going choice though EU making contract public sure got things motion feeling. Ahhh, kind royalty. far know, one producing vaccine profit. case I'd ok less open source vaccine, long production met standards making vaccine. One day. Sure. Everything ends one day. first appeared expecting spread much easily actually does, probably reports China Italy made sound like zombie apocalypse going there. think heard predictions saying could R number 6, worried get merely walking someone room virus. actually contagious yeah could see collapsing supply chains would literally make country call sick time, turned nowhere near that. idea EU screwed screwed big time. able even vaccinate healthcare workers many countries. Situation looks dismal. 6 months? No. coronavirus, like common cold flu. Constantly mutating, likely going around forever. probably need mandatory seasonal vaccines finish thing happen living Pandemic. They've happened before, they'll happen again. It'll one day man. specifics actual order found CDC's logo actually terrible tbh... Japanese thought looked like symbol Japanese funeral. always thought seemed symbolise grim future event bad premonition came true guess.   least 6 million Yeah... no-one Australia drinks Fosters. personal protection nice community spread dropping like crazy now. long shits get arms going see shit 4th July unless variant fucks us up. Virus's start spreading feel like it.  say 100% efficacy. misinformed?

100% efficacy preventing death. 

Honestly efficacy matters?

The Chinese vaccine poo-pooed 50% effective also 100% effective preventing death (+ moderate severe Butantan stressed vaccine 78% effective preventing mild cases needed treatment 100% effective staving moderate serious fillers I've sort changed mind. think one available sooner worth getting &amp; also starting work 2-shot version maybe whoever got first one maybe gets booster later raise efficiency. might 2 shots effective either way this

if options available I'd def 2 shot though heard. Meaning heard. Meaning may may true. vaccine doesn‚Äôt prevent transmission it‚Äôs useful might think. vaccine produced every capable facility world right now? problem affects wellbeing humanity. ability produce vaccine exists. thing limiting supply people want profit. acceptable let people die twisted set values.

We could mass producing means produce vaccine warp speed! scaleable produce vaccine 100s gallons per minute? could training every nursing student, train everyone willing administer vaccine. 

Meanwhile, Tesla space gawker accomplishment. vulgar. bet people trying get able get April mayish. Hey, potentially killing others feel healthy totally cool! Im keen vaccine 66% effective vs. two supposedly 90+% effective. really hope J&amp;J improves effectiveness one lying. I‚Äôm still trying get vaccine it‚Äôs always unavailable! early one check? Immunity bug specific, it‚Äôs specific part bug. part SARS-CoV2 Pfizer Moderna vaccines prompt immune system hate destroy don‚Äôt appear part that‚Äôs commonly selected (and I‚Äôd like stress selection essentially random much deliberate choice) ‚Äúnatural‚Äù immunity. say ‚Äúnatural‚Äù every process occurring develop immunity vaccine full infection, it‚Äôs manner body initially introduced foreign substances that‚Äôs different (an injection rather respiratory droplets, case COVID). strong reactions seen second doses vaccine direct product vaccination, inherent sign immune system responsive active. Fevers rarely due direct action pathogen rather defense mechanism mounted body. 
In relation level immunity you‚Äôre also asking about, knowledge (most recent education stuff immunology first year med school), interference strength immune response ‚Äúnatural‚Äù infection subsequently immunized. fact, developed antibodies things called memory cells part virus vaccine targets, he‚Äôll effectively stronger immunity. subsequent infections immunological memory, response become rapid efficient. typically represented looking antibody titers, easiest snapshot someone‚Äôs immunity get. You‚Äôll see higher titers subsequent infections, meaning antibodies produced, assess strength antibody grabbing onto nasties, you‚Äôd also see increase. 
Hope answered question gave enough context without overwhelming. live? Somalia? No.

There pressure virus anything. See developing mutant stains contagious lethal.

Left alone virus continue trend, kills peak infectiousness there‚Äôs reason less lethal.

Maybe go take basic community college microbio course get back us. I‚Äôm board vaccine, would take J&amp;J vaccine. notorious rushing products without valid testing people always get f‚Äôd. No, fixed number told wrong haha. looks like misread numbers article too. Still less 5% though, vaccine! respect celebration opinion, think misguided delusional think tourism collapse good world, especially Australia. get off-hand habit say, Implying loving God okay with/at blame pain suffering everywhere exactly offering condolences. Also, going vast swaths morons refuse get vaccinated?  Yep. lot people claim ""long covid"" never confirmed covid first place, symptoms attributed number conditions including depression. ""studies"" largely consist self-reported symptoms short period time infection. 

Post-viral symptoms well-known happen infection. nothing new. projection made regard UK (variant) probably end March, beginning April, actually become dominant country,"" Dr. Anthony Fauci, director National Institute Allergy Infectious Diseases, said White House news briefing Friday. variants likely worsen spread coronavirus add death toll, Institute Health Metrics Evaluation University Washington forecast Thursday. US death toll Covid-19 tops 436,000 people, Biden administration already called 100 days mask usage well increase allotment vaccine doses state 16% hopes managing impacts virus made January deadliest month pandemic.  Phase III real world trial. conducted lab. Tens thousands volunteers collected given either vaccine placebo, told one received. told go lives normal. significant number coronavirus cases volunteers (around ~100-150 enough), check see got virus didn't. 

That number cases already enough narrow efficacy vaccine relatively small interval. Pfizer official definitive data Israel. quite easy determine got vaccine hasn't, confirms Pfizer's data trial.

There control group here, makes bit harder read efficacy like trial. artificially create control group choosing amount people vaccinated, fact vaccinated means meaningful difference people vaccinated. underlying reasons lead people vaccinated others unfortunately difficult pin account mathematically. means 92% number also good estimate, like 89% 95% phase III trials were. posted elsewhere needs visibility. biomedical scientist whatever worth. Fauci bang usual. Spring/summer great we'll think over. be. 

I reading NY Times minutes ago lack anti-virals. Someone, sure who, promoted malarial drug, spent tons $ effort testing it. point, 1 somewhat effective antiviral. Now, antivirals easy make get approved, all. like HIV, this. take probably 10 years find antiviral COVID, something do.

Why ask. going away. 33% peak 2 weeks ago, spring/summer get lower still, fall strains vaccines poorly recognise sweep population - bad before, still bad. we'll still stuck right now. raging pandemic. real cure. Vaccination entire population, again. simple measures done really need done. Stay away people. Wear KN95 N95 mask. gather indoors. much effective anything else. kind 66% effective? case, CoronaVac, based inactivated v√≠rus, seer decrease efficacy, right?  realize Florida currently vaccinated greater percentage state Michigan? think need pull monitoring much been. like we‚Äôre heading unrealistic expectations disappointed wake every day see it‚Äôs still here. I‚Äôm going tune month hopefully come back pretty significantly better portrait reality üëçüèª It‚Äôs hilarious. Important: likely factors caused 16 respond vaccination also led getting severe covid. Namely: weak immune system. valid concerns, like pregnant people though, since tests necessarily cover them. may choose wait well.  Yeah. sure hard understand authoritarian regimes bad track records human rights violations. Ya got me.

But apparently seems even harder understand broken clock right twice day, also take learn mistakes without repeating better giving could hard do.  ""may"" ? think private sector vaccines?

Oh boy.

If knew talking about.

Newsflash, private sector those, even close.

Again, private sector could vaccinate 1.5m day, DoD wouldn‚Äôt many troops already involved calls thousands more.

There‚Äôs reason every country successful CoVID19 vaccine roll used basic infrastructure get shots arms. Yeah Pfizer vaccine looks like best I'd definitely choose risk group parents anything else atm.

Modern western culture really fucking terrible child raising. remove multgenerational aspects living, grandparents help parents actual watching raising children, also emotional relational support actually gone themselves. pressure solidly rests parents now. 

Then add Covid mix parents can't physically get away breaks children. recipe disaster. Bla bla bla I'm selfish bla bla bla countries make vaccines? evolutionary pressure works, every action creates reaction. behaviour drives virus toward survival.
 IMHO airline wants people fly, need offer test pre flight free. already nickel dime people is. Yeah, Canada fucked right EU supply chain (which Belgium, go throw eggs want probably help). It'll fine 2-3 months approved vaccines faster production. summer fine. Vaccines also cause new variants. anti vaxxers tiny drop bucket billions worldwide likely NEVER get vaccinated.

Covid continue mutate become endemic. We‚Äôve know since last March spokeswoman, Margaret Harris, said wanted appeal people UK, telling them: ‚ÄúYou wait‚Äù ensuring equitable global distribution ‚Äúclearly morally right thing do‚Äù

WHO place lecture nations morally right. organization made pandemic worse reverse bad advice.

The UK midst terrible outbreak it‚Äôs pointless saying don‚Äôt need vaccines.

The can‚Äôt even handle basic jobs supposed do. Let religious leaders moral compass, international politically driven organization. 

Just yesterday reverse statement two days ago pregnant women shouldn‚Äôt vaccinated. backtrack outcry real scientists telling wrong.

The needs completely reorganized. joke become. I‚Äôm posting hope someone knowledge verify me. 

Obviously COVID people don‚Äôt develop significant symptoms short term, extent illness seem dose response (ie virus exposed sicker get). mild disease J&amp;J vaccination, assuming due partial immune response limits viral replication body. possible people mild initial symptoms became long haulers reacted high levels virus time/took damage reach point noticeable? case would think vaccination would reduce chances long term symptoms less virus create damage. 

Again, don‚Äôt know. I‚Äôm hoping people knowledge stuff confirm/correct thought process. addressing fact J&amp;J vaccine recorded less 70% effective final trial? forget that?

... Maybe I'm over-reacting. borders matter **if** they're closed, water lots miles separating rest world helps lot.

If whole world followed Taiwan's example shut borders entirely, least China, back January, might looking different situation. ship sailed year ago. view people businesses stop listening entirely lockdowns mandates. Couple things people remember:

* ""having vaccine"" ""people agreeing voluntarily take it"". (which assuredly, percentage NOT)

* vaccinated,. mean cannot catch Corona Virus pass along others. Hahahaha ‚Äúgive week 2‚Äù favorite meme coming sub. hope realize you‚Äôre walking stereotype originally thought post satire lol said vaccinating ""as many people can, quickly can,"" best defense new variants.

True. test. wear masks. Test separate sick healthy. US never got testing right. cheap rapid saliva tests keep reading FDA still approved. Why?

That said, vaccine rollout different. good anyplace world, much better most. want vaccine yesterday, get months, hundred papercuts between--but see reasonably complain macro picture.

To miracle discipline number vaccine scalpers limited has, considering scalping every kind, shady prescription drug distribution, art forms US.

I‚Äôm glad things turning around neighbours. r/nevertellmetheodds stuff.  aren‚Äôt pushing anywhere.

Mutations random. ones help virus make copies become prevalent, ones result fewer copies die off.

It‚Äôs sentient. Surely it‚Äôs cheaper (or free hope) get test travelling get destination ? $150 rip off. would guess getting US much problem. real oversight enforcement quarantine protocols moment. Guessing even less summer. Going back Canada going hang up. unlikely interfere natural immunity. Can't speak vaccines Moderna Pfizer vaccines different immunity reactions natural immunity produces. 

Antibody testing even notice vaccine given. People vaccine still get antibody testing see Covid. Yh globally still around doubt since poorer countries unfortunately missing vaccines. number countries pandemic like Israel, US, Canada, European countries like UK, Germany etc. They've got thsn enough vaccines order protect citizens. No, vaccines also cause mutations. don‚Äôt believe research yourself, it‚Äôs commonly discusses phenomena virology. That's *totally* point trying get across. Opinion pieces rules it‚Äôs haphazard whether get removed. efficacy 60-70% no-op. Risk get corona high preventing/stopping epidemic/pandemic certainly J&amp;J effective.

The difference vaccines age 50 healthy negligible. time spent worrying vaccine get better spent buying helmet wearing times. reduce risk dying significantly getting Pfizer Moderna vaccine J&amp;J vaccine. 

And J&amp;J effective enough end pandemic. [Everyone credibility said vaccines good enough end Yes! This. hospitals would turning people away like happening Africa Ebola. would absolutely horrible No, facts need come out.

Cuomo, like governors, made big mistakes regards Covid nursing homes, needs admit happen again. Telling people mental issues ‚Äúdeal it‚Äù helps soooooo much ""a idiots"" need mandate it?

Reddit sure keen regulate things claim everyone going anyway. ""Nobody wants go eat out, shut FORCE!"" trust though. full 7 months test long-term effects!  think emotional basis anxiety?

No. Phase III Phase III. 

Those data may valid may valid. 

Those data may garbaged(Sputnik-V, middle Dec 2020, could provide official links). 

Those data even falsified. 

Those data misinterpreted.

Real world data get mass vaccination results world.

Pfizer gets 95% III Trial Phase 92% real world. Perfect. Perfect.

J&amp;J gets 72% III Trial Phase data real world. Bad... I‚Äôm going respond get back daily cross country road trip yeah like definitely better nothing think still implies masks &amp; social distancing would still required People need public transit. That‚Äôs exists. Says company that's making vaccine that's 66% effective. It‚Äôs deserve. God, wife's friend insisting wedding April (after already postponed twice). Like damn, put 6 months. Sorry, we're certainly going. I'll damned want get month get vaccinated.  vaccine like 66% effective something like based recent studies missing something here? &amp; times spreads, chances mutate.

More chances mutate means chances bad mutation including mutations infect someone 'original' covid happened S. Africa &amp; Brazil. right! Yeah lets let disease run course, re-infecting new variant, like Manaus, Brazil... repeating instead engaging what's said, I'll try one example.

People get flu shot yearly, they're different strains yearly, could get different types (live attenuated recombinant protein based).

We run trials look every possible combination. able asess understand risk based knowledge vaccines immune system work. 100% guarantee? No. neither trails perfectly representative every genetic background possible medication combination environmental factors.

I'm sorry risk health every day :( work good Pfizer &amp; Moderna lab tests vs real world trials like J&amp;J know well would really SA Variant. J&amp;J 20% less effective SA variant. Also still waiting hear tests Brazil variant going Pfizer &amp; Moderna.

the companies unhappy enough results immediately announce going make boosters. carefully phrased press release sure vax would hold up, worry. don‚Äôt know link drop spread vaccine yet. It‚Äôs mostly likely end holiday surge IMO. means we‚Äôre race Spring Break right now...

People claim whatever want r/teachers/. (Or Reddit sub) doesn‚Äôt make true.  Good I'm holding Wegmans brand vaccine. Danny's got goods Considering takes DAYS get prescriptions CVS, trust vaccine rollout. hardly handle prescriptions plus Covid testing. know cannot handle plus vaccinations. that, vaccine kinda sucks. Less long term testing 66 percent effective. don‚Äôt use word hate much damn genuinely hate man every ounce fiber body fucking competition. know meant good news, reading past week vaccines available earlier adult wants one get one spring.. June 4 months now. 

How husband going avoid getting covid 4 months we're US state SA variant spreading, works hundreds people inside factory. dad. family screwed. SA variant going bring cases 10 fold, hospitals already full. think June. keep working, there's high chance they'll get covid. quit, lose home, groceries, Healthcare, car.. üò¢ make another 4 months. Yeah, honestly fuck websites annoying pop-ups content blocking alerts.

Edit: good tip use browser like Brave click Brave icon go advanced block scripts certain problematic article. Usually loads least text  talking Delhi government anything last 10 months. Amit Shah organized ""Bihar victory parade"" Delhi cases time high. want say politicians shiny look.   Yet total mortality significantly higher. thing vaccine long-term effects short-term. literally happen. people still get infected also pass even though vaccinated. vaccine prevents people getting severe illness. 
Everyone may basically asymptotic carrier. Stockholm Swedish city. made quick search, seems like one 21-year old experienced organ failure mild case Covid. probably number similar cases, seem typical mild Covid. hospitalization drops lot, society reopen. Simple that. *glares Wisconsin* like bacon Different boss makes sense. didn‚Äôt appreciate reaction/side effect angle.  use phone soap least enclosed. work least cleaning something touches face people mRNA vaccines might willing take one since understanding it‚Äôs traditional vaccine. that‚Äôs another reason good news. going unfortunate people get 66% effective J&amp;J vaccine opposed moderna? France, Germany UK populations distributed evenly. almost uninhabited forests mountains covering half country. think works exactly? I'm curious. see one get worse one today mRNA one supply constraints gone though. offered J&amp;J one I'd take it, would still try get Moderna/Pfizer months line. think it‚Äôs likely people get duplicate vaccines within short time span? still spread Covid non-vaccinated people (namely children can‚Äôt get shot, yet) you‚Äôve vaccinated? can‚Äôt get solid answer this. Even they're federal tribal land? issues actually come sites production issues arisen French pharma company eu insisted part supply chain. various production lines countries faced issues.

But AZ mean said November halting deliveries governments optimize shelf life, bulk vaccine already produced holding bottling reason ready churn 100s million doses starting January? related UK order, right? churning 100s millions doses there.

In November AstraZeneca said, **deciding** postpone deliveries governments production issues, explicitly said production issues.

According Advanced Purchase Agreement inform EU production issues produce alternative facilities including UK facilities production issues.That probably EC surprised irritated said UK production totally separate EU production.
 
If actually produce plants use British contract, would produce factories common get high enough yields beginning productions would plan bigger production according APA EU actually according common sense.

You cannot say common problem say would unreasonable greater production capacity reserve, essentially smoke screen AZ core issue.

The reality is, AZ said production problems one plant therefore could deliver actually knew say month behind therefore could guarantee full yields, plan greater capacity begin with.

They essentially arguing unexpected issue(therefore unreasonable plan for) already obvious contract signed (therefore fault long negotiations) oversight eu's part thst demand contracts specify event disruption contracts prioritised 

No, oversight, design also part AZ contract CureVac contract. problem Belgian plant, stop delivering Canada Israel, reduced supply customers. 

That explicitly EU called said wanted avoid vaccine nationalism since AZ included UK plants contract contract UK AZ secret EU known UK plants exclusive said COVID-19 pandemic caused countries divided approaches mitigating threat, ‚Äúwith cheque book wars airport tarmacs nation vied nation supply PPE‚Äù, can‚Äôt continue context vaccination health every country depends whole world access safe effective vaccine, wherever breakthrough might occur; and‚Ä¶we everything power bring about,‚Äù think sign contract another specified others cannot compromise fulfillment position ever sign contract interfering that. UK communicated stance last year, secret contract ruled UK produced vaccine would go non UK citizen got 100 million think sign contract another specified others cannot compromise fulfillment position ever sign contract interfering that.

The order contracts signed issue continental law. UK law improtant gathered issue EU-AZ contract signed Belgian law EU courts charge enforcing also worth noting UK ordered 40 million pfizer doses- shortly eu ordered UK guaranteed 5 million doses pfizer end march 2021 fulfil much larger eu order priority given contract signed first 

Yes, see exactly thing. Pfizer sign contract deliver 40 million doses UK even though asked it, already promised capacities point.

AZ hand **now** claims always knew able deliver signed EU still signed contract, naming specific factories would use production issues putting statements November halting production shelf life may well know include clause priority. 

No, know case since Pfizer reduce production EU get fewer doses doses still pfizer also encountered supply issues cut back supply fault AZ British government. 

What point here? mentioned Pfizer deal proof fact EU vaccine nationalism UK even know EU introducing controls exports vaccines said would done guarantee contracts followed, contracts include sharing losses among customers address point say handling distribution pfizer vaccine actually different AZ vaccine 

No different. Pfizer plant Belgium reduce output burden shared among Pfizer's customers including UK. AZ production issues burden shared among AZ thst UK insist setting new manufacturing supply chains UK. Also AZ making profit vaccine believe Pfizer is....

The whole point AZ vaccine actually well could produced everywhere main downside mRNA vaccines specialized uncommon production facilities are. reason mRNA plants set everywhere countries strong Pharma industry like Switzerland, Germany, Belgium US.

Critizising local production ChAdOx vaccine outright absurd shows media blitz AZ deflect responsibility customers warped perception experts rooting AstraZeneca vaccine succeed much cheaper mRNA shots Pfizer Moderna. Plus, come stringent cold chain distribution requirements associated vaccines. AZ development partner, University Oxford, teamed drugmakers around globe expand supply worldwide vaccination production around world plan begin with. fanciful idea EC. AZ making profit vaccine believe Pfizer is....

AZ produced production cost plus 20% price development cost infrastructure buy produce vaccine obviously keep afterwards. build house cost buy truck crane hire workers pay costs afterwards keep crane truck, charity every company would take deal every time. 

the CEO Astra still gets paid workers keep machines buy ad cost production.  untrue. new variants emerged long vaccines rolled out.  sparsely populated people actually live. pretty drastic difference.

Oh god ""Trump"" narrative fake news arrived LOL!!!

So give source UK Media, direct quote coordinator Vaccine Taskforce, say ""fake news"" slapped face reality start blabber random shit without single source xD

The level delusion cognitive dissonance astonishing! deal son, escape reality can't deal it. blue fuck fur industry still exist? see point, spread around.   That‚Äôs going happen I‚Äôm MN. competent governor made feel safe even Trump around. He‚Äôs got this. None Sweden's 21 regions covid deaths / 1M pop 400. 100% asbestos brands! Seriously, I'm tired completely-unproven-by-studies point constantly coming up.

By logic, treat prevent diseases people die car fuck morons problem?

Lmfao. budget $24,5000 per student per year. That's point. Zero COVID pipe dream, would inhumane restrictions people ever inflicted modern times. Killing millions animals proactively prevent retransmission mutated back humans, giving small population workers vaccine minimize risk seems like pretty good allocation resources.

Im pleased farm animals fur, that's different problem.   I‚Äôve seen polls indicate 30 percent don‚Äôt want it. May accurate. I‚Äôve saying beginning: populations truly never get back normal (not new normal, old normal) unless 50% people become anti-mask. come point people vaccinated hospitals near capacity still restrictions ‚Äúyou still spread it‚Äù.

I‚Äôve told friends they‚Äôre convinced listen experts trust restrictions lifted say so. I‚Äôm doubtful. think it‚Äôs less experts say everyday people put foot open terms giving governments choice.

Astrazeneca made doses UK sent bottled spare facility EU. customs records corroborate investigations contrary thrown nothing. Try keep up. I'm waiting till 2022/23 go back normal. one really wants that. Anyone higher risk older gonna take get right I‚Äôm guessing JNJ available general population eligible get vaccine time anyone risk older get heavy duty MRNA protection less risk protected fine JNJ. workplaces mandate vaccinations. suspect place used work (nuclear power plant) require people vaccinated.

Maybe don‚Äôt know it‚Äôs pretty much headache that‚Äôs annoyance. definitely would say people take following day work get it. Agreed , Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine go EU US first. (let hypocrisy begin) Yeah, it‚Äôs rich. ‚ÄùIt‚Äôs hoax .... where‚Äôs shot.‚Äù Good it. Countries/places contained Covid-19 situation well (e.g. Macau, Singapore, Taiwan, Hong Kong) mandate since last year.

Wonder CDC enforce though.  we? Seems like UK USA stacking production themselves, still get doses Europe.

Basically Europe, China, Russia India producing everyone - UK USA make still want more. Here's vote help get rid stupid message. read article? convincing them. infallible, undying argument. lockdowns fail, lockdown 'hard enough' fantastical metric made head. point, shoot people site walking house military order, electricity plant workers stay home also, absolutely zero online delivery anything all. Maybe they'll satisfied. anywhere mandated already? get fucked useless pieces shit?

One good thing fruit high Vitamin C America tell get stuffed. Definitely Google it, I‚Äôm seeing lots articles linking study showing around 52% efficacy first shot. sub coming terms able stay inside 24/7 socially accessible anymore. No. private companies will. trust local CVS entire state government. quick google search shows lots articles journals showing study showed 52% efficacy Pfizer single shot. hope right. Perhaps people take without consequences others willing. Hypothetically, let's say young, healthy, work home. organization support allows get vaccinated early group, would it? got hundred cases/day, population 60MM. they'd kept going bit longer, borders closed TTI ramped up, could done it. anywhere mandated already?

I've saying point, close grocery stores, cut internet/water/heating 2 hours day minimal schedules plant workers, shot sight outside house reason, absolutely zero takeaway online delivery make people happy. finally 'beat COVID'. Really? hear that. That‚Äôs good know. heard Dr. Fauci say yesterday wanted remind people still need wear masks social distance still catch virus pass nose throat. 

And congressman Lou Correra received vaccine doses still caught virus. said felt perfectly fine symptoms even though tested positive. still isolate longer contagious. Definitely not. fact, risk catching COVID would likely lower normal interacting someone recovered recently. Haha... No.

The shut fuck up. one going wait, they. country going pause vaccines thier country expense thier citizen's lives name charity. EU Programme vaccines falling apart. nothing wrong countries seeking vaccine programs. somebody covid, would rather break neck paralyzed break leg work months April seems impossible May possibility BIden goes heavy defense act FDA approves Novavax using UK studies... neither expect happen fingers crossed! variants already US won‚Äôt stay rare forever, especially restrictions start lifted. Sooner later, we‚Äôre going worry coming face face SA variant. Multiple vaccines + increased production along masks social distancing get us there. Yeah people know positive, suspected person test it. positive assume whole household positive quarantine together without getting tested. go first. vaccine likely broad spectrum contains whole virus rather spike protein. Even spike protein changes antibodies useful. article addresses vaccine preventing getting infected, meaning don‚Äôt virus replicating respiratory tract, yes, absolutely would protect long-term complications,‚Äù Schultz-Cherry says. ‚ÄúEven still virus replicating, it‚Äôs much lower levels can‚Äôt get deep lungs, would also predict would less long-term complications.‚Äù Bolsonaro career Hydra I‚Äôve got work college. Live dorm partying roommates. Guess I‚Äôll take vitamins.. nephew‚Äôs fianc√©e large family simply didn‚Äôt care gathered Thanksgiving Christmas. didn‚Äôt, Aunt died October thought prudent host 75th birthday uncle (I GO, immediate family). ventilator 38 days died November 14th. 

I called gatherings day, got super pissed said ‚Äúnobody got sick‚Äù. told didn‚Äôt matter nobody got sick. got lucky, still wrong thing. It‚Äôs like saying ‚ÄúI drove home drunk, didn‚Äôt matter didn‚Äôt kill anyone‚Äù. 

My Aunt gone forever. stupidity, it‚Äôs still forever. I'm imagining headline year vaccine rollout slower expected certain states governors demanded certain messaging taking credit. list people literally anyone 55+. That's 95% deaths 65% hospitalizations. honestly point idk. legit thought today Moderna vaccine 1 remember saying news mom even convo gets would want Moderna, telling get choice cause got choice everyone would everyone would pick ""1 shot"" moderna pfizer cause easier. 

Mom even acknowledged convo happened, I/we can't life find I/we heard/read Moderna 1 shot from. Nope restrictions gatherings recommendations masks etc... milder working healthcare systems people stay fuck home sick! 45% country truly cared hospital overrun, there‚Äôd lot less backlash methods required actually achieve goal. 

And yes, community immunity goal vaccination programs anyone thinking COVID vaccine, seen Feb 2020. swear companies fucking money hungry didn‚Äôt already exist? Well better late never guess better get covid die quicker guess Good. delivered 2023? know probably got hotel since many rich people quarantine hotels away family. 

There centralized quarantine centers instead essentially pass hotels. article makes clear arrivals. US announced week ago they‚Äôre requiring negative test flying US.

This someone flies Rhode Island Oakland, wants make sure don‚Äôt COVID 6 hour flight. someone went biking work, lifting things 8-16 hours day, biking home, going play frisbee climb yawn time tired, something must wrong... think know wrong.

Edit: covid... Meanwhile state completely open, everyone‚Äôs back work. Like state government decided it‚Äôs over. 

I‚Äôm jealous states lockdown. Must nice expose every day work. 100% protection hospitalization death

Thats complete bullshit, everybody knows statistics knows thats insincere statement.

The numbers low statistically significant.

Hell, IIRC, dead vaccine group major vaccines, could claim ""100% proof dead"" made liars.

You would need least 10 times larger group make educated statement regard. Yeah hit first others started awful tried swedish way different mindset general social contact. would laugh hard person comment King Leopold's Belgium. Remember, we‚Äôre going seeing indisputable effects climate change next decades

We already are, already do.  upvote counts prove otherwise. First read article second all, where‚Äôs evidence back claim Trump made people lose trust vaccine?  OK bad example holy hell lol AIRLINES. LETS SAY, EXAMPLE, AIRLINES. Well uk made mistake go sweden's path March hospital system overwhelmed hit emergency break. Austria counyr instance made mistake explicitly try follow se model summer till winter. result overwhelmed hospital system November schools closing sick teachers emergency break 6000 additional deaths end November. uk deadlier variant rampant. see seeden fare one. Novavax likely vaccine choice private market around world (except rich countries perhaps). easy distribute store, highly efficacious, also based older technology compared mRNA/viral vector ones too. Yoda: Begun Vaccine Wars have.

Yoda 5 Minutes Later: Start Vaccine Wars want. example makes sense someone used travel 150+ days year, I‚Äôd buy stuff airport.

I didn‚Äôt buy electronics vending machines, I‚Äôve posted past person pays premium airport brooks bothers such. didn‚Äôt want waste time home mall, killing hour airport I‚Äôd buy new shirt pants, etc. flight every day went lockdown, that‚Äôs LOT time airport.

With that, business travelers majority flyers, airports typically catering them. ever see something airport ask why, answer likely business travelers fly 100+ times year. new Macron quote based new information. German Interior Ministry citing enough trial participants 65 age group. saying INeffective, they're saying efficacy proven. AstraZeneca showed strong safety profile younger older adults, strong immune response groups, real-world infection data 65 group. can't fault Germany opting use AZ vaccine geriatric populations, also feel AZ hiding anything. people 65 trying hard become infected lol. expect they'll continue run efficacy trials come back firmer numbers. Doesnt bother lol People need think little less literal :) problem lack data age group (i) efficacy inferred/extrapolated (ii) can't certain safety (which arguably cannot extrapolated lower age group higher)

 There's also FT's Good point. knew efficacy 99.9%, said, ""better 5% getting might expectation"" little vague little vague. looks like comparison general population getting 0.65% still takes tweaking get 95% comparing 0.0156% that. guess vaccinated group older? make likely symptomatic infected? Well, I'm sure calculation takes account. Also BLM rioters last summer someone explain EU Canada performed Trump administration. Like Trump administration close million day. Definitely bust part! Given option though, sure. 1918 pandemic ripped around world turned seasonal influenza -- 1918 influenza never stopped 1957. likely 1889 Russian flu epidemic emergence coronavirus HCoV-OC43 gives us common cold now.

This still serious still need take seriously, vaccination we're going less go back normal (I'm wearing fucking mask airplanes airports going forwards though I've caught least 2 3 colds, one horrible influenza norovirus going vacations past 15 years, I'm fucking N95'ing shit on).

I'm worried short term old folks get vaccinated, everyone stops giving fuck -- still want get virus wait till I'm vaccinated well. think read article transmission and/or cases gone Israel since vaccinations began according preliminary data primarily regarding Pfizer vaccine 100% protection hospitalization death. give person power monarchy.... enlightenment era vs 16-1700s real-time replay..... 

there perfected witty response ""god's plan"" defenses... just.. aghast.. Paywall tied **ability spread** coronavirus utter bullshit; 

I say one symptomatic order spread covid, said less severe symptoms means less likely spread. European ski vacation super spreader events happened one months period one vacationing businessman spread virus around 25 days showing symptoms. 

I idea talking about, presumably case infected people would symptomatic, would spread COVID. case, never said spread unless body mobilizing strong immune system response equate virus suddenly spreadable. 

Again, never said this. competent government secure domestic manufacturing something required get self mess, that's costing billions day, 100s lives. even short sighted fool could see sort disagreement real possibility There's HUGE problem North Louisiana (MONROE AREA) concerning fair, efficient vaccination distributions surprised happening statewide places. issue disgusting, frustrating, embarassing idiotic many ways. Vaccine providers ""one goal-focused"" epic pandemic that's get many people vaccinated quickly possible according CDC guidelines. Hospitals, clinics, doctors' offices, pharmacies, labs designated locations one job: administer vaccine. Instead, personally found facilities using access vaccines marketing tool acquire new patients taking advantage elderly patients seeking help!

For personally, trying help older family members get Covid vaccine appointments, told get appointments health clinic unless one clinic doctors primary care physician. So, way could schedule Covid appointments change primary care physicians schedule appointments physcians.Then, told vaccines time. looking new doctors. looking get free, hopefully life-saving vaccine. Free marketing unscrupulous health providers thanks State Louisiana? Wow! Shame them! ALWAYS people companies trying take advantage bad situation. know, bad apples? State Louisiana careful, diligent, add checks balances figure President Biden sends vaccines clinics hoard. Randomly ""check"" facilities practices.

Also, I'm pretty upset healthcare workers getting vaccinations timely manner. either want don't. biggest supporter industry mom retired nurse. know profession patients love. also know, would never waited another day jeopardizing life, family's life, life patients co-workers public. understand everyone scared side effects. really luxury time right now. 400,000 dead people would gladly taken vaccine. absolutely ridiculous almost month many Louisiana healthcare workers gotten vaccinated. wont mandatory (like kids' vaccines school), healthcare workers take shot move end line allow next group move up. cannot indefinitely weeks months ponder getting vaccinated people waiting dying. vaccines expiring thrown areas? me, NEVER excuse that! would rather vaccine facility send workers stop people red light, pull people hospital cafeteria, go parking lot, pull school board office vaccinate teachers roll college campus vaccinate students throwing perfectly, much-needed, expensive, life-saving vaccines! never option discard them. team effort. wont work unless part common sense folks. COME LOUISIANA! USE COMMON SENSE! BETTER! UK banned exports. made Yea  It‚Äôs undoubtedly real also seriously doubt it‚Äôs helped obsessively posting Reddit forums every crummy day actually lingering symptom covid.  massive focus masks US seems backfired. always wish people could boxed forced explain god playing sides.... doubt it'd productive result.... neve rknow.. religious would say God's plan move towards rapture. realize unofficial death toll 790k (370k Jan 3rd 420k excess). Go check out: CDC keeps saying ‚Äúwe‚Äôll 500k February,‚Äù already know 500k it‚Äôs ‚Äúbig number.‚Äù Media would ruin wild ‚ÄúHalf million dead!‚Äù number, bet it‚Äôll go real quick it‚Äôll slow around 1M trickle truth us ease us acceptance 1M dead Americans. honest, vast majority American population high risk? kinda would feel fine without florida tho....... gub glub knows? definitely going reveal Jan 21. Right? 100% effective hospitalizations deaths. Also, efficacy getting even moderately sick goes 80% weeks get shot. Trump did. paying attention? tool propped take fall. Bolsonaro going blame management absolve himself. like falsely accused Brazilian Supreme Court limiting ability manage crisis handed responsibilities state governors. never imaged morally reprehensible devoid empathy individual. Let us easier citizenship get conservative hell hole. I've seen enough people wearing masks lately stores make numb, would weary ... shadow tourism Austria Alps areas B117 already pretty widespread. notice numbers really wanting go instead going like areas. b117 car without travel connection contact trace check hole is. Right , that‚Äôs first world problems right there.

I‚Äôm interested vaccine , hospitalizations essentially zero? Stop fear-mongering. Covid-19 endemic. friends live Sweden. don‚Äôt wear masks. Businesses open full capacity. Restaurants open. Movie theaters open. missing anything?

Half states US lockdown. Look CA: severe lockdown measures one worst outbreaks. Feelin' good MN. said city, meant. Maybe are, there‚Äôs plenty things do. Go beach...go sporting event. things happening summer decreases 100% death ie could get covid feel like cold We‚Äôve actually already begun exceed that. We‚Äôve given [1.6 past 2 days. (Scroll 1/3 way linked page.) hope so, there's 7 Billion people world cover, there's 220 million adults thats 3% world. What's interesting mindset could work way too; get vaccine get severe side effects and/or die it, God's will! main thing want know vaccine prevent us getting ""long covid"" event contract it. Preventing death hospitalization good, long covid effects (heart, lungs, etc.) not.

The main question get J&amp;J Vaccine later get Pfizer Moderna? Right influenza taken hit fitness already many years ago. 1918 H1N1 pandemic would fit variant. whole world got infected point R0 original wild type pushed well 1.0 pressure immune escape. resulting H1N1 virus became endemic less virulent probably due cost immune escape became seasonal influenza.

And guess semantic argument call factor 2 much lower. still high enough there's good chance coronavirus mutate achieve immune escape also become endemic. statements thread like ""covid nothing Influenza comes mutating"" reads MUCH stronger like worry, virus mutate it'll go away -- much true. That's kind statement I'm arguing against. truth much middle, variant fever daily headlines.

And felt clear original reason epidemiologists happy mutations level influenza slight less fine meant vaccine development possible.

I'm somewhat skeptical variants really changing much, virus likely turning replication rate host create higher viral loads. creates transmission also virulence, basically sliding lever along fitness curve. selection pressure producing probably due incomplete immunity (as chunk herd attains immunity R0 previous wild-type drops virus pressure increase R0 enhanced transmission virulence). also explain more-lethal second wave 1918 virus (see example [this lost trust? assume also refuse medical assistance kind anything, right? refuse take kind medication underlying conditions, like hypertension, diabetes, etc?

If god control, us come modern miracle vaccines use them? WhAtAbOuT.... Can‚Äôt die COVID drown first  thinking certain state governors (I know DeSantis said this) asking could start dosing people single-shot Pfizer/moderns regimes skimp vaccines? news Government could require Disneyland impose policy. Ever think that? really need said since Government things? branded Tyler Perry's Vaccination? interesting happens b117 gains wider foothold south african variant. heard rumours swedes might dragged shadow skiing tourism Alps. fair - flu comes Southern Hemisphere little travel make happen. Plus flu super nonexistent it‚Äôs cumulative effect. Texas Governor Greg Abbott: HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!  remember Houston, right? Fuck poors, I'd let Joel Osteen sale em $1000 dose could. ""just dysfunctional""? 


Denial suit anyone said example. saying ""Lets say"" smh go reddit serious medical questions. asking doctor question Remindme! March 1, 2021 first March, june. seems like able tell long would take using math instead pushing months back 2 million arriving next week. 
Proof? well beyond beginning end. beginning end found Pfizer Moderna 95% effective.  true. Florida exactly middle road, 11 states greater deaths per million real lock downs, 16 states fewer deaths per million real lock downs.

That's compelling case lockdowns.

16 states blew economies worse deaths. 11 blow economies worse deaths. People say no, sneak line. think anti-vaxx sentiment going get crushed within months. anti-vaxxers vocal minority think there's are. rates over-80s fallen 36 per cent month. age groups seen similar falls, biggest drop twenty-somethings whose rates halved.

Unless UK focusing vaccinating twenty somethings, I‚Äôd say drop cases naturally induced herd immunity vaccine. Um.... probably missed part said almost 100 covid cases. 9 referencing students.

This take account many states basically open right now. Florida basically anything. Gyms, concerts, clubs, bars name it. believe are, know least one CPS school near sure it, whether parents (or parent, many cases) time schedules different matter. 

All I'm saying additional levels uncertainty variables means food security net nearly strong was.  also possible keep mutating becoming less severe like cold?  end February. mean Trump left us nothing. going take minute get running do, hoo boy.

I know answer course profits American think insurance pay. course take J&amp;J vaccine option goal would eventually receive one vaccines offers 90% greater effectiveness. worry insurance cover 2nd dose already vaccinated even inferior version. course... day-one mandate. question is, ""Of wear masks whatever reason, continue wear masks public transportation, going enforce it?""

It comes local police enforce it, citizenry help police. Sorry loss. better person, Mom. needs new law similar hate crime law assault people asking wear mask.

Refusing wear mask intentionally letting virus spread. spreads spread others weeks later hundreds people may infected die get life's savings wiped hospitalized. people wearing masks public intentionally KILLING people. bus driver drinking driving shooting cars bicyclists, he'd committing crime lot trouble. Moderna going deliver 200m end June = 100m complete vaccinations

Pfizer going deliver 200m end May = 100m complete vaccinations

J&amp;J, approved, able deliver another 100m-200m doses Mayish = 100m-200m complete vaccinations

So late spring/early summer US vaccinations available people give to. True not, there‚Äôs chance people another year.  said working home! you‚Äôre going often 
You see rush hours inside buses trams packed visit restaurants packed im talking G√∂teborg 

Last April government reduced amount buses trams increase 
Less buses = people buses 

80%-90% people wearing masks tell im nit telling truth? No, doesn‚Äôt work way. Antibodies blood disappear sometime body actively fighting pathogen using said antibody, would body waste energy produce it‚Äôs used. 

So testing antibodies useful testing short term immunity show currently infected not. really determines long term immunity memory plasma cells, cells responsible making antibodies specific pathogen. cell last long time blood. body reintroduced pathogen, instead two week delay bodies produce specific antibodies, much faster humeral antibody immune response. vaccine priming body non attenuated virus infects us I've looking forward SDCC long now, really hope still happens. Starts 30th birthday year. need something look forward point. There‚Äôs lot people never leave homes think real world actually operate way flu. Every year.

Oh, brand new account.

The draft law aimed set ‚Äúfuture legislative framework managing pandemics efficiently,‚Äù added. Yeah, masks mask mandates alone definitely decide trajectory local epidemics. mask mandate lowers cases around 30% so. obviously growing epidemic 30% - example, place cases doubling, mask mandate would mean instead doubling cases would grow 2*0.7=1.4 times 40%. 

And similarly waning epidemic without mask mandate - non-pharmaceutical interventions, behaviors, natural immunity also matter. mask mandate would make fall cases even faster, though. [1]

When Glamour profiled people Elmhurst Hospital Queens Women Year award, specifically sought member housekeeping staff. No, death curves always lagged cases 4 5 weeks across world. Thats long takes average someone die testing positive. known since March. everyone 15? science... scientists... data... 

California tried that...how'd work them? straw man all. There's enormous social pressure areas see everybody masked outdoors, I'm sitting country right actually requirement, fine attached non-compliance. Except know really true. original SARS much deadlier result much easier identify trace. said person labelling anything like ""Russian"" grandma grows dick tomorrow she'll grandfather maybe covid.

But nope, let's carry talking largely ineffective handwashing semi-effective masks social distancing.   Wow, wrong  see. Shall change ""it shows within week so""? good point. good point. actually correlate cause? perspective, enough time passed vaccine made impact.

This likely Less shit talking acting like entire subreddit afraid leaving basements. recognition going change things pretending care Let rephrase it, brings fatality 0 2-3%. relevant quotes article: ¬†It 66 percent effective overall preventing moderate severe disease four weeks shot.... Company executives emphasized vaccine 85 percent effective preventing severe illness...   No, no, please no!!! Looks like soon back extreme lockdown. ""on order"" mean get anytime soon‚Äîor within next year. Canada secured 10x population's needs, struggling receive them, dates supplies getting pushed back / reduced time. response directly link sentence put in. ""If side effect, shows right away."" know every news station still loves talk horrible scary things are. But, looking number cases county (USA) drop like ton bricks every day Worldometer makes happy. Go vaccines go!!! I've never heard before. conditional herd immunity? Much better 0%. Might well get j&amp;j available get moderna pfizer later supply opens You‚Äôre right article mentions vaccination people Tier 1B state opened tier. happened country doses needed go arms expire.

What article doesn‚Äôt describe people Tier 1A denied chance vaccine Tier 1B candidates could vaccinated instead.

Maybe happen maybe medical center instead making sure doses went use didn‚Äôt enough Tier 1A candidates available. There‚Äôs enough information article say case.

In either case seems like state putting politics public health cutting community‚Äôs access vaccine. gave impression aware measures outside US. 1960's mentality, I'm actually far left well btw  looked Pfizer Moderna‚Äôs data regarding SA variant? certainly effective. 66% efficacy minor illness. 85% severe illness, 100% death Think way, would think losing vaccine vaccinate someone Alabama? long non-Alabamans vaccinated, cares? messed COVID containment, sucks them. go Alabama. 

Just US vaccinated mean we're back normal. still travel restrictions mask/distancing recommendations manner reasonable precautions economical impact has. Things better, yes, viruses care nation-state borders, share boarder trade heavily Canada, they're still getting sick, there's still chance get sick (either via mutations virus infection vaccine work).

It's far easier islandizing North America islandizing US. Oh, don‚Äôt know, whole 95% effective vaccine thing could something it. I'm 66% sure ...

However, need step genome sequencing identify new domestic variants may favorable traits virus. Anywhere widespread infection lead new variants would want aware of. add %vaccinated estimate.

Why add that? people got covid getting vaccinated also asymptomatic cases(or symptoms test tested false negative). ""I‚Äôve heard rapid test always accurate..."" there's hope right there. that, really wait see. Dude every single Democrat said 

You lot full shit.

Do know Nancy pelosi Biden crew worried February?

Racism 

Impeachment 

There archived tweets Nancy Deblasio encouraging partying Chinese New Year, Trump called racist travel restrictions DNA vaccine mean viral DNA adenovirus vector .... first adenovirus vaccine ever approved approved one year ago - Europe Ebola. would call ‚Äúold‚Äù technology years safety data millions people.

That incorrect. burden showing giving many millions Let's honest, challenges 21st C, Alabama Florida first dead. Never mind J&amp;J vaccine showing 85% efficacy severe disease 100% protection hospitalization death.

When comes disease asymptomatic mild case leave severe lung damage?

Hell, yeah.

Tell using vaccine get severe illness, even mild illness leave severe lung damage. Making huuge profit blowing money ads stuff can't supply? Lolwut said, ""slaps"" Right. said prevelant. Asymptomatic cases suffer later effects stands reason faulty vaccine one would protect long term effects.

Unvaccinated asymptomatic cases thing (almost all) vaccinated cases. (unvaccinated) asymptomatic person time infection pre-existing immunity, immune system start scratch taking days weeks even figuring virus' aspect building robust antibody response target kill it. vaccinated person, even gets symptoms COVID, immune system built-in defenses ahead kick soon possible, even strongest.

Even common cold cause viral pneumonia, older HCoVs circulate. likely get one almost extremely immunosuppressed invididual. (and often do) still develop symptoms common colds though. 

Immune system response **can** prevent viral pneumonia, rely on. question may better be, vaccines turn COVID mostly upper higher-ways respiratory infection not, people happen mostly immune? seven day average still we're chilling coincidence. Wouldn‚Äôt anything changing PCR threshold? Fair point. Ever drive Alabama stop couple gas stations? would see first hand shit going up.

This might likely, that's confirmed data. please say vaccine effective infection vaccines.

I hope data shows true, then, let's please stick facts. Dude, people live paycheck paycheck U.S. still handled incredibly terribly. That's half million people dead. Trump, Bolsonaro, anyone pushing herd immunity BS deserve blamed shamed it. grim reality Deaths lag behind several weeks. We‚Äôre still seeing deaths late December included daily totals. Question: first real trial-run mRNA vaccine? even effective throw first 10-14 days. infections time period people contracted Covid got shot (incubation period), still count ‚Äúagainst‚Äù vaccine effectiveness. wrong made laugh? fear-mongering. Check Medcram YouTube channel. bunch videos explaining sorts COVID-related stuff. recent interview immunologist explaining mRNA vaccines; helpful. really get information scientists themselves, media friend. if, getting vaccine, get asymptomatic mild case leaves severe lung damage still going feel incredibly fortunate privileged? making up. Vaccine efficacy linear like that. 52% single dose includes first two weeks vaccine barely effect. two weeks rises 89%. Also see J+J. 72% old variant vs 57% SA. big gap Nova can't imply Pfizer Moderna fall proprtion another vaccine. even vaccines greater efficacy severe disease hospitalised. That's really market works. Makes sense. US cases decline since January 9th. I'm still sure trust company [continued supply baby powder laced babies. decidedly said, 'fuck it.' worth remembering widely reported 60% figures never came directly AZ. even then, lowest possible - i.e. nothing improved. analogy also big flaw, too: horrible war is, actually builds social cohesion. People trenches together form bonds last life. Communities pull together support troops, etc. War time sacrifice social isolation. Quite reverse.

You get refugee/hostage situations find greater level social isolation this, one said flat suck, ever. Severe means sick home case. Better book travel next year everyone else gets idea hotels cost small fortune. refer ‚ÄúMatthew Stafford Rest‚Äù. Except we've seen articles people asymptomatic mild symptoms still ended severe lung damage.

How effective preventing get mild case vaccine?

Who wants mild case that's going leave severe lung damage? know want. Incest jokes? Cmon man dont think enough data provide definitive answer yet. know trying sell people getting vaccine (which good) im sure immediate symptom point. Canada shut border first. Canada happens.

Until see credible explanation 85% ""severe"" case -- defined including hospitalization death -- different 100% 'hospitalization death' case, bunch marketing-speak me. I‚Äôd say they‚Äôre better spreading virus. symptoms mild can‚Äôt even tell guards get let down. School/daycare outbreaks happening constantly, it‚Äôs real.

what encourage would rather guinea pig **Novel** Coronavirus vaccine, know say.

personally take chances vaccines find bad long term effects could virus top maybe giving someone could die it. prioritization contracts, 13.1 (e) even says clearly UK contract impact one EU Give 1.5 doses then. Sorry included finalizes ‚Ç¨500M boost COVAX
‚ÄúThe European Union signed promised ‚Ç¨100 million ($122 million) grant ‚Ç¨400 million loan Gavi, Vaccine Alliance"" Oh it‚Äôs written piece paper proves vaccinated. Says February 5. due poor management, told goes 15 people work with, there‚Äôs enough vaccines. ran out. TL;DR: Alarmist article (almost hysterical points) repeats obsessive expression ''go zero'', ''go zero'', ''go zero'', mentioning words end article means (lockdowns, travel restrictions tracing). nothing new. prioritization contracts, 13.1 (e) even says clearly UK contract impact one EU Polio started grandma 5 year old. still eredicated, like 99%. So, sounds stupid Well unless fake age unlikely. job basically offered vaccine me. got it. told second dose February 5.

All coworkers boat. 65. idea get point gen pop anyway. goalpost stop moving people resist foolishness. agree. virus transmitted people chance mutate yet even deadlier strain mention fact animals pets transmit back humans completely different mutant. Seeing RNA vaccines use spike protein order attach human cell order produce antibodies variants Brazil South Africa UK among others spike protein mutating mean I'm rocket scientist epidemiologist matter specific part vaccine supposed work humans specific part variants changing new virus strains common sense efficacy current vaccines much less previously expected. mean like every illness 2020? Canada, like you, *like* like you. bad rabies shots years ago, reactions go back dumb

We've got genius get you, sometimes take breaks news sanity. second point, comment either way :) raised point defence vaccine distributed heavily UK hotspots regardless point origin UK vaccines go EU, think coming from? sat around warehouse, going straight people, go EU instead, taken people originally going to.

The EU working improve efficiency factories EU, trying take vaccines somewhere else use it. said commission, ensure they're treated fairly, keep everything. want know pharmaceutical companies actually telling truth say there's ""production problem"" shipping EU's share production somewhere else. that's happening there's problem.

 AstraZeneca mysterious ""production problems"" seem magically solved overnight since measures announced.

We together AstraZeneca behaving like towards Europe. Block raw materials would severe response.

You mean like EU trying demolish Irish GFA? Oh wait, lmao  think easy produce vaccines. need existing plants take long. That's also reason BioNTech licenced vaccine Pfizer.

EU 76% vaccine manufacturing capacities. would ""not exporting vaccine population taken care of"", already would vaccined population. Point legislation blocking exports vaccines UK percentage people get *severe damage multiple organs*? made three assertions first 2 sentences. Two claimed fact. third guessing that's whole argument. ... blocked exports since last summer.

Point legislation blocking exports vaccines UK That‚Äôs lower effectiveness one dose Moderna Pfizer vaccine.

The Moderna vaccine 80-90% efficient one dose. No. happening. Unless country good fortune absolute crazy crackdown populace year ago, toothpaste tube. ZeroCOVID strategies countries **today** would absolute death sentence public education, housing, travel, employment, mental health. late, would insanely inhumane. Get people vaccinated, monitor flair-ups especially nursing homes care facilities, set clear metric hospitals feel 'safe'. ZeroCOVID happening anywhere else. politicians trying figure end jail. takes time away vaccine planning. 
Each vaccine, drug, treatment, tested safety independently. scientific reason suspect may harmful interaction two vaccines/drugs/treatments, tests done assess that.

But understanding underlying science indicate reason negative iteration, may monitor don‚Äôt hold back treatment give special precautions. saying run hundreds thousands separate clinical trials possible combination new vaccine vaccines medications someone might have? that‚Äôs science public health works. mind blown expert adjacent field corrected got downvoted personally it‚Äôs fact it‚Äôs 1 shot. someone severe phobia needles legit would rather die Covid go back second shot Soviets used incentivize people. silly still silly now. Ice Cream people freezing? Really? thoughts exactly ‚Äúyou‚Äôll get mild case‚Äù said. People mild cases still ground glass opacities strokes! 

Mistrust officialdom among Russians dating back Soviet era doubts authorities‚Äô decision approve Sputnik V testing complete kept many people away, despite Russia suffering one highest Covid-19 tolls globally.

Only 38% Russians ready take Sputnik V, according Dec. 21-23 poll conducted Levada Center. Good luck convincing take it. What's got EU's sudden lurch Trumpian politics? Yes. still continue mask social distance usual. possible get Covid twice even you‚Äôve already that‚Äôs terrible reason stop masking. far vaccines go clear much prevent transmission. could fully vaccinated safe, still carrier virus infect people vaccinated. masks We‚Äôre still trying eradicate measles, polio, plague, mumps, etc.

COVID widespread there‚Äôs always going pockets asymptomatic carriers societal reasons immunisation e.g. strict Muslim countries

It‚Äôll always part world we‚Äôll learn live like we‚Äôve learned live everything else

Thousands cross border everyday ""essential"" purposes, many putting Canadians risk. Yet Canada feels need shit anyone crossing work.

Here's one get associated challenges parents caregivers face without additional support lockdown. 

So many bad parents rely heavily professionals order screw raising kids. 89% confirmed real life well, 89% like 85-93% since still small amount uncertainty. 

You obviously free try get Pfizer Moderna vaccines, quite honestly time spent worrying differences vaccines completely wasted. would effectively managing risk time spent worrying vaccines instead spent installing roll cage car wearing helmet every time drive. know feels European. export vaccines world (Canada, Israel, UK, Mexiko, ...) behind. 76% total vaccine production capacities would vaccined also export bans like US. True really need better statistics this. worry medical community insurance companies tend try discredit bury long haulers.

See lyme disease...  Y‚Äôall gon wait    Enforce bans? Good luck Spain.  true. correct I'm wrong one less targeted? wonder mutations effect vaccine less others? understanding mrna based ones target specific parts virus.

My wife works hospital Florida heard thing. scheduled vaccinations sister hospital, apparently multiple times, throw vaccines vaccinated person show trying contact days.

All second hand, manager told wife trustworthy nonsense individual general.

It makes mad even think about, can't wait get vaccination! wife received second dose couple days ago, still worry bringing virus home pick limited social interaction nowadays. mean far data shows 100%. would telling know confidence interval though. I‚Äôm totally also... smokers getting priority? Usually can‚Äôt even transplant list you‚Äôre active smoker. would want reward case? Contrast India exporting vaccine multiple countries. EU passing laws forbid export. One might think EU larger population India. Oh wait, opposite true :( Perhaps EU less competent government. creating evolutionary pressure vaccine-resistant covid strain inoculating billions midst pandemic? Yes. way 66% going fly you‚Äôre going spared permanent damage. Either that, everybody‚Äôs boss going OK 66% work heart brain damage thanks trusting vaccine 66% effective. 50% vaccinated, consensus median prediction cumulative number deaths Dec. 31, 2021 520,000 deaths. contrast, less 50% U.S. population initiates vaccination consensus median prediction 645,000. It‚Äôs mask stop drama queen. It‚Äôs far deciding live life. mask actually impede doing? absolutely negatives wearing mask. Nothing proven say actually anything bad body.

If government actually wanted control they‚Äôd much subtle way. Otherwise they‚Äôd get whole country them. people idiots everyone is.

When pandemic people stop wearing masks amount government advice could change that.

Just reiterate - you‚Äôre asked wear mask reduce spread virus, indirectly helping others may vulnerable virus. government isn‚Äôt controlling it‚Äôs taking sensible action. Oli claimed Indian virus. Nepalis share sentiment? saving life 8 million funny you? snow crash haven‚Äôt read yet- I‚Äôll prioritize it. Thanks info! Board Members ask ""But pay it?""   100% man. you‚Äôre gonna roast trump hard can‚Äôt take easy Biden. 2 party system ridiculous. people still listen guy says? Well, it‚Äôs like current decline cases hospitalizations happening CA. It‚Äôs happening nationwide, even states barely locked didn‚Äôt all. Best thing DUP done past year. Making EU miss-use article-16 public. serious effect. Source? UK US ordered early.

The UK US paid more, investing 7 times EU, per capita, vaccine manufacturing.

And importantly, US UK made contacts bind first exports priority manufacturers bankrolled states.

Meanwhile EU broadcasted far wide hypocritical lies exclusivity, drawing countries invest manufacturing EU.

The EU literally stealing vaccines paid order cover incompetence. Yeah, look rollout EU, disaster. US rollout actually one best world right now. country even vaccinated 2% population. know, I'm Dutch too.
It's honestly pretty embarrassing minister says speeding vaccinations done earlier deliveries Q1 cut significantly. shows slow vaccinating, even 60% cut one vaccines affect us. interesting think EU hurt this

Where say that? UK paid manufacturing plants got online early...what exactly EU doing? Negotiating price reduction cost price vaccine. huge unless know confidence interval is. example Pfizer trial supposed measure severe cases. ended sticking result supplementary information confidence interval crossed zero cases even though technically efficacy 75% (vaccine arm one case placebo arm three cases).  Another Emmy way?  actually go GFA, poor form wield like sort bargaining chip, without notifying Ireland UK. Let know confidence interval Pfizer trial confidence interval crossed zero fact even efficacy 75% often enough severe cases trials give sort statistical power. companies understand covid get free pass massaging numbers media. emergency make sure safe first, can't help anyone else dead. understanding (and may little wrong scientist) supply thing. many vaccines go around, covid last 90 days probably naturally immune better give vaccine someone needs wait Vaccines tested kids yet
 

Plenty healthcare workers refused vaccine. Also pregnant women 

So no, over. same..but recommended data. article:


The Centers Disease Control Prevention said COVID vaccines pregnant women haven‚Äôt studied clinically, believe Moderna vaccine unlikely pose risk since mRNA vaccine, live vaccine, degraded quickly ‚Äúby normal cellular processes.‚Äù That‚Äôs best news ever. Also I'm give Bolsonaro bot screeching 'fake news' much time day. Maybe... assume reason crossing work leisure? Oh true Trump bad long, honestly I‚Äôm waiting shoe drop. üò¨ people take it? joke? one, understand it. plan, would criticise EU it? Apparently half US wants vaccine initially, shipments vastly outnumber people coming vaccination centers. could early end march US. Trump objectively horrible president. virologist consider virus altered, differs oriniginal virus least 20 factors/points.
including least 1 alterations spike.

Its complicated ofcourse. thats giste.

When sais strains, means mutated like that.

The many variant mention: differ 1 15 points. Higher numbers much less common.
Changes spike important thats bodies detect it. CI severe cases Pfizer trial crossed 0 way even though 75%. That's include main trial article stuck supplementary information even though one predefined endpoints. going see disappointment trial bet. Typical socialism- everyone suffer mud together eh? Countries different situations different reporting standards, early draw conclusions that. government response hardly variable.
The article looks statements actions government Brazil, government Italy. 63 everyone condition. Compared 20 year old, organs show wear age. False. Americans like *cheese product*. Real cheese actually produced America whatsoever. care anymore ...i keep healthy, advise friends family same.

For rest ...it's back usual ! EU skip Pfizer? order increased 300 500 million doses option 100 million more. anything, EU strongly rely Pfizer main vaccine producer many months come. J&amp;J perhaps also get large role, depends ability produce deliver large quantity doses EU. rapid tests arn't bad. catch infected people, especially high viral loads. Obviously pcr better rapid test addition mandatory mask wearing prevent vast majority infections travelling. There's special storage requirement Pfizer either, 5 days fridge fine, can't get people's arms 5 days dispensing all. Eh block exports UK response expect would blocking lipids importer UK (as understand sole supplier europe) case pfizer vaccines export... manufacturing would cease. EU needs see they're brink starting vaccine trade war thst zero sum them. Zoopsie daisy Yes, association long Covid severe disease. also booked providers actually scheduling 20 minute appointments things.

Is possible affected level immunity could develop? people (Brexiteers mostly) blew proportions made EU vs UK somehow, never was. always EU vs ""Big pharma"" oh sorry idea then. Source? getting AZ stop whining.

How could UK get Canadian shots? Ignored one 

I British happened. UK invested I'm vaccines research supply lines set manufacturing last February signed contract guaranteeing 100 million vaccines supplied UK plants could used fulfil contracts may many signed nations. eu chose wait negotiate longer signing anything signed end August started work supply chains manufacturing. That's 6 months Oxford uni (who made damn thing) British government began work theirs. Consequently British manufacturing chain track deliver required 2 million vaccines week (note end March 16 million ish.) eu demanding first 100 million end March told likely get like 30 million. UK received 100 million production lines used supply others eu Australia etc. eu's demands would literally mean doses UK would cancelled redirected Brussels even they'd still 54 million short. FYI released contracts days ago, look thought EU fucked up, ‚Äúbest effort‚Äù clause way legally binding force AZ divert vaccines uk anywhere else, good luck getting court agree you. Also, producing vaccines many countries, India Australia don‚Äôt hear EU calling India less vaccines, UK can‚Äôt really think reason bitter UK didn‚Äôt mess  Nope. efficiency two doses Moderna 94.1%.

Employers require vaccines, issue COVID-19 vaccines fully approved. used Emergency Use Authorization. hasn‚Äôt established whether employer require get vaccine approved EUA. think ""better"" vaccine go need, since Johnson Johnson prevent serious cases well, could easily go young generally healthy.

Personally thought effectiveness kinda hits sweet spot people line got Moderna pfizer stick them, people far back line see value Johnson Johnson.

Iirc testing two dose version possible Johnson Johnson end effective others changes two doses weeks apart

Yes, vulnerable older people die causes near future old many cases already frail. prioritizing vaccination program would go idea medical treatment allotted according highest need first. 

That said, vaccinating people care homes home care. also vaccinating health care workers simultaneously, primarily workers elder care, ER‚Äôs, infection clinics primary care system.  Amen. know people think going happen things return ""normal"". normal look like this? exactly sure means. one strain SARS-CoV-2, variants variants strain. virus 300k variants, original variant outnumbered long time ago.

I thought made clear expectations mere expectations come assumption work similarly first component Sputnik due exactly design... not, sorry, speak. 
Sure, that‚Äôs actual trial, that‚Äôs guess, educated enough confident unless proven otherwise. 

I insist one thing. vaccine efficient infection, matter put it:

1. certain percentage infected patients fail develop long-term immunity actually die result infection. That‚Äôs 1/10000000 chance unexpected severe anaphylaxis, talking large statistically significant numbers here. 
2. Post-COVID thing, way predict it, least yet, significantly aggravates health issues, point people end dying ordinary flu shortly thereafter.
3. Typical S-protein specific IgG readings prime-boosted vaccines tend three times higher recovered patients. half-life much longer too, suggest better immunity severe case prevention long run.
4. consensus mucosal immunity moment. say it‚Äôs supposed there, others don‚Äôt, info IgA knowledge, actual data yet. first true, that‚Äôs awesome. second true, upcoming nasal vaccines may turn better - either whole solution primer. data long it‚Äôs going last too. Nasal flu vaccines aren‚Äôt great here, unfortunately.
5. mentioned potential advantages disadvantages clear, least me. easily go either way. wrong, sad is. 72% protection rate US, 66% protection average 52% South African variant.
85% protection severe COVID (hospitalization death). 

Only need one injection instead 2 kept refrigerator temperature 3 months.  CDC. Sweet. I‚Äôll take moderna Pfizer though since Johnson &amp; Johnson half ass relevant question hand? Someone argued richer nations fully vaccinating better result vaccinating 10% entire world. 

But vaccinating 8.5% world population could dramatically cut deaths. current roll going irrelevant.

Please remember consider context discussion. swear god media surrounding Covid Basically ‚Äúyeah society isn‚Äôt going back normal years get used losers‚Äù difference huge.

If 80, morbidly obese, lung problems yeah difference might huge you. 3 things, completely fine vaccines (which worse). mean J &amp; J 66 percent effective theres good chance wouldnt really bring back normal practical way. soon 21 years old who‚Äôs sooo ready party soon i‚Äôm able responsibly... since US mostly vaccinated wayyy us Canada, guys think people could go across border events summer? Even age category can‚Äôt get vaccinated then? Controversial opinion, maybe simply ""over 65"" way broad. 65 work people target. 65 retired option stay home nursing home backburner. Teachers get retirees since people insist upon ""in person learning""

Many states already offered vaccine first responders. Much smaller group let's say, entire baby boomer generation. Cringe. believe day people would vaccinated infected United States. dangerous. local health department pharmacy get away stocking excuse covid vaccine, since it‚Äôs cheaper them, there‚Äôs even less chance get one good ones. Highest priority remains protecting vulnerable. Old people, immunocompromised, diabetics. get shots could totally go flow. 1918ing 2021. We'll still disastrous ICUs excess mortality it'll least everyone's personal responsibility.

But fuck immunization vulnerable mutations extend process going flow 1918ing way go. reasonable answer here, downvoted sea yesses.

The vaccine short supply, people protection need now, even antibodies anymore memory cells already. enough. That's entire point vaccination. florida  understand see many posts Americans vaccinated end spring, there's 300 million them, yet Canada barely gotten vaccines far, still hard lockdown gyms closed everything, likely shots fall. yet supposedly spent money per capita vaccine country. fair? really hard upset this. Another Chinese Canadian? Yes. Wait 90 days last infected.. honestly think places like California smart prioritizing elderly currently enough vaccines even go around throwing entire rollout chaos? Well, great litmus test see proverbial shit together Cringe. I've read doses made UK bottled EU, happy contradicted, anyone better info? that's mouthbreathers reddit think shopping vaccine brand like new fucking cell phone option #1 thing need lower spread mass vaccinations turn lowers hospitalizations deaths. get vaccine J&amp;J, Moderna, Pfizer, fucking it. Cringe. Source 2 million? still planning 100m April? I‚Äôm vaccinator told us yes, get vaccinated. It‚Äôs unknown long immunity infection. Plus, variants may still infect made smile. Watch press conferences, people. Biden already announced 100 FEMA mass vaccinations sites works. military run sites usual no-nonsense precision. need supply arrive. Chinese? guy picture look like realized left 1000 doses vaccine counter expire? didn‚Äôt even give chance!

First, tell everyone buy leave n95's hospitals. people want protect themselves, often want something allowed. creates panic due everybody buying them, there's shortage prices n95 go up. profits, market.

Now probably different, little less profits. Everybody got used that. So, decided show public regular masks useless saying wear 3 masks uncomfortable expensive. So, many people perhaps come point ask ""why buy n95 instead?""

So ask distribute them. think why. spending money make profits? Holy moly... protect yourself. it‚Äôs strong enough kill virus probably strong enough mess well.

So yeah, we're fond *because* incompetent deliberately cruel. J&amp;J third trial results show 66% effectiveness? even usable ? Funny everyone talking EU ‚Äúblockages‚Äù doesn‚Äôt actually realize what‚Äôs going place transparency system, EU Commissioner actually assured us export restrictions geared towards Canada. 

And case there‚Äôs OVERALL production delay, they‚Äôll simply want track exports make sure it‚Äôs shared equally. trying rude here, there‚Äôs lot material situation seem read. There‚Äôs also whole 52M doses Novavax aid hitting September target, oh 10M minimum J&amp;J! suppose there‚Äôs also 20M AZ they‚Äôre absolute dumpster fire, even though AZ production isn‚Äôt coming EU. reading everything overall gut feeling. would like take one new mRNA vaccines. guess choice, would take whatever offered, think, agree. need states' permission? know, that's said majority. doubt people life limiting complications.

You're talking like every president kind shit trump doing.

We someone cry arrest president every time new one, guess what, already now. started paying attention Bill Clinton, confirm called arrested multiple things. Trump showed president actually deserves go jail looks acts like. we're gonna ignore calls prosecute why? 

Because must homogenous treatment politicians lest called hypocrites. No! Baseless accusations, rally chants, slogans, etc thing prosecution crime, like judge attorneys. 

We saying arrest try president trump opponents shouted it. actual crimes. That‚Äôs really good insight- thank you! know 28 21 days thing. plenty mutations didn‚Äôt affect protein spike, don‚Äôt really hear that.   poorer EU countries amongst quickest countries world vaccinate, expense richer countries EU bit quicker. Nah think good thing. Countries like Netherlands Germany example could've spend lot vaccines, get earlier even produce within borders. tried, wanted buy 400 million AZ vaccines June, EU called back. equal amongst EU countries. this, might EU countries finished April something others even finished 2022. EU wants show good solidarity union, must've done. called socialism, US socialist too, also spread vaccines equally different states. let states vaccines give states ready pay vaccines. what‚Äôs suggested. fewer points failure delivering vaccine, it‚Äôs literally easier fewer things go wrong. can‚Äôt rogue pharmacist leave freezer spoil. power goes don‚Äôt lose doses. someone misses appointment don‚Äôt need run street ask rando want shot don‚Äôt dose goes bad. set distribution basically anywhere don‚Äôt need worry storage temperature. Nah, June another strain dominant, wait new vaccine.  Yep, handled excellently year ago. It‚Äôs way late us EU get now. ""Less likely"" mean ""they spread it""  problem putting together tour, even single show, requires considerable lead time. also requires expectation tour able go - risk cancelled events expensive. we're judging based solely ""will safe 120k people field"" october, think odds would high.

People still mistakenly think COVID nearly exclusively old person disease Thank you, atleast normal people still sub.

Outliers exist every illness planet, rare matter much. UK strain expected become predominant variant months USA, according experts. hiccups get overreported harped on. 7 day moving average like 1.1-1.2m right now, increasing steady rate. Production main bottleneck right now, understanding. 1.1-1.2m/day still tremendous, especially they're getting high-risk arms. Hopefully see continued declines hospitalizations dip deaths next couple weeks. 60% isn‚Äôt good enough odds you? Exceot summer actually temperature much kills virus's stops spreading least UK hahaha UV light- higher concentrations breaks proteins... also changes humidity impede spread respiratory virus's UK summer. 60% efficiency lol culture includes large family groups one roof default ‚ÄòLatino‚Äô. Numerous cultures/ethnicities across globe (or done so). Housing LA (and elsewhere) expensive. Makes financial sense stay one roof. Multigenerational families one roof (regardless culture) increasing commonality. also estimate close 30% population already sick (4x tested).  This, along holiday peak, could definitely cause slow new cases. It‚Äôs pretty amazing one dose vaccine able stored fridge temps 100 percent effective severe disease death 49 days, among circulating variants, somehow failure idiots.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* [attacks looking people arn't attacks British looking people now. Besides plenty people saying racist call British South African variant. recently listened podcast new variants (the Brazil one wa also included) understand talking ghey use scientific notation (B.1.1.7 think British variant). Covid easy remember, bunch numbers not. J&amp;J vaccine also work better second booster shot.

While agree you, let's wait data make statement. joke. number countries wanted sort deals ensure supply. EU came along said ""?no must together sort naand help others. must done together every nation treated equally vaccine shared (they changed tune...). basically vaccine socialism expected ended right mess.... consequently everyone poorer it. Put Chick-fil-A charge rollout think last 4 years taught us Republicans fucking everything fuck country gladly send ex president jail could. 

I think sending Trump jail happen since know political norms window reason play nice. fucker broke many laws far political prosecute him. 3,832,080 total cases

 3,279,964 total recoveries

 72,697 total deaths Also skeptical mrna vaccine funny like basic mechanism exactly immune system does, less messy.  Yeah common mostly anxiety, people sub Reddit never change real life.

I mean hundreds thousands people millions recovered? Nothing. see, thank sharing observation. would like point sample isn‚Äôt cross section people claim long haulers - redditors willing post specific sub. know subreddits become echo chambers reward certain narratives. would hesitate use paint broad strokes. wqy read amount mrna vaccine exposes equal covid bad would probably died (volume virus wise). 
The first dose supposed trigger response. second, letting body know threat around make extra protections (think cells instead antibodies). 

If already get latter response guess. That‚Äôs good you, wait. later vaccines? taking Johnson Johnson disqualifies vaccines puts totem pole? don‚Äôt trust all. say severe illness, people deal consequences virus years come. It‚Äôs body get decide it. owe coffee this! Haha 3.5 deaths 40 deaths per 100,000   covid April, got vaccine 1A folks got theirs. I‚Äôm group 1B. health department recommended everyone 1B get even COVID (within vaccine timeline guidelines). also extremely high side effects. yanno that‚Äôs ok. think minor ethical issues put aside times national emergency. religious people say ""shit happens"" ""it is."" off-hand comment. like 'thoughts prayers'. Non-religious people seem get especially butt hurt phrase, offering condolences. particularly women, younger adults, lower socioeconomic status, experiencing psychological distress related COVID-19 wonder mrna flu vaccine would do. going write maybe but, no. get eligible.

1. There's way tell everyone risk tier covid got vaccine you. high number asymptomatic cases, bound tons people getting vaccinated virus never found out.
2. virus before, antibodies could gone time get vaccine (we know immune response who've virus shorter vaccine's response, too), vulnerable never virus. especially true people got virus last spring-summer.
3. Depending severe case was, might developed antibodies *at all,* point punished getting covid denied vaccine, dumb frankly unfair eligible otherwise.

If already virus want make personal decision wait couple weeks become eligible vaccination let people go first, that's choice. I've work area I'm exposed tons people daily, likely antibodies gone I'm getting vaccine soon available me. want risk another bout virus especially first round came despite following social distancing protocols. sure ran arguments quickly. surprising lmao Personally enough half assed lockdowns uk every months. It‚Äôs ok go work vicinity people can‚Äôt work home, get furloughed get 60% wages...but it‚Äôs ok vicinity people outside work can‚Äôt go anywhere everything closed.

So work ok...actually life outside work ok. We‚Äôre basically serfs point there‚Äôs fucking end sight I‚Äôm tired it. run vaccines every week scheduled appts getting cancelled left right NY. What‚Äôs worse? got mine Thursday, literally place empty. Guy said ton spots open. However.... online system says they‚Äôre full? We‚Äôve seen people registering 3, 4 sometimes 5 different appointments they‚Äôre ‚Äúafraid‚Äù get canceled. gets cancelled due people like making seem like fucking system overwhelmed, idiots. Okay well didnt answer question all. mean 60 times heat? saying gas, oil, coal use produces 60 times heat earth sun? would bother vaccinating 50 Pfizer,

Because limited supply AZ, J&amp;J etc foreseeable future vaccinating Pfizer much cheaper waiting vaccines approved (even ignoring health benefits vaccinating people sooner). 

Maybe understand much vaccines actually cost compared pandemic. live Ireland use example. Firstly, Pfizer vaccine costs ‚Ç¨12 per shot compared nearly ‚Ç¨2 per shot AZ ‚Ç¨7 J&amp;J (one shot). lets say Pfizer jabs cost ‚Ç¨20 extra per person (full prices Guardian link below).

Ireland's welfare system (between basically furlough unemployment) 550,000 November (rte link below) costing ‚Ç¨103.8 million per week. 4.9 million people total, meaning around ‚Ç¨98 million expensive use Pfizer AZ population, less cost one weeks welfare (only 350,000 temporary unemployed due businesses closed pandemic 103 disappear). taking account amount spending PCR tests (doing 100,000 per week cost roughly ‚Ç¨200 start pandemic, probably less now) PPE, reduced tax take, impact peoples lives. make economic sense wait cheaper vaccines even one Personally I'd take constant high risk could get. wonder layer vaccines? Say get JJ vaccine later add Pfizer one?  like you.  fool though, UKs vaccine factory's rubbish ramp production... EU point time then. like growing crop, takes time make brand new farm productive. cardiologists. thank you! EU justice commissioner accused UK wanting trade war. 6,600 cases 5 months. medical, nursing, pharmacy students already trained immunize within first ~2 years programs (varies school school).

Lack critical thinking plays big role that. People led believe science equal, see journal article think conclusion valid. Less 24 hours horror over, replaced ""good news!

Life normal parents kids school. makes working really difficult. 

Not mention zero idea long term risks kids Covid. lot spectulation even people mild asymptomatic cases long term brain organ issues, know that's true kids yet. 

Just many issues Covid, mean escape long term issues. parents need consider kids long term health deciding go back normal, especially vaccinated long. Yeah think bunch restrictions, definitely back normal. Also, think idiotic even open right now. Here's decent paper relative ease coronavirus mutating evade therapeutic monoclonal polyclonal antibody reading makes statements seem contract I'm arguing immune evasion coming cost. they're talking ""only"" double/triple/quadruple mutations achieving escape therapeutic nAbs coming limited cost. I'm talking complete immune escape vaccinated prior infected patients, establishing new infectious strain new epidemic involving 20 epitopes spike protein. likely come substantially larger fitness cost paper discussing.

I know published papers even preprints covering likely fitness cost mutations necessary achieve full immune escape. think we're yet. Doctors India already got first dose vaccine.

From February, vaccination common people start. cell testing exist reliable. couple papers reported blood samples taken 2015 demonstrated cell activity Covid, virus exist back then. hypothesis crossover reaction seasonal cold coronaviruses.

But people still SARS1 antibodies 13 years infections quite possible Covid antibodies highly persistent, least sufficiently sensitive test. think people forgetting wfh normal times lot different wfh global pandemic.

The credit vaccine implementation lies state local government me, fear-mongering variants increased vaccinations picked up?

Like I've wearing mask avoid large gatherings since March (while destroying mental health process), remember seeing article back April talking East Coast US hit variant virus Europe deadlier seen China West Coast. fact media obsessively talk variants vaccinations started extremely suspicious.

Most important quote article imo. Equally holds true respect comment section general :-) Midwest United States messaging beginning cut back much outdoors.

Abstinence never works longterm. Wow kind dumb ya? could afraid waiting see safe vaccine is. one crazy anti vaxxer. country in? People vaccinated: part arm inject? specific recommended area?  YES. Yep. I'm not, vaccines useful course plan getting it, normal enough make return normalcy like many people want. comes herd immunity gang ride wave.  Uh oh know means. Rollback protections working thing last longer. 

Source frustration: deadliest month far state gloves longer required businesses opening hours extended. 

Removing protections soon numbers start drop sounds exactly like intentionally extending pandemic. think people definitely stupid people paranoid people both. discount valid concerns blows mind many people refusing vaccine without actually looking scientific information readily available trying digest context help people understand better do. understand comment telling someone go public? support shutdowns mandated think need paranoid Covid19, need acknowledge different highly contagious, people affected severely, need take precautions understand work/their limitations. They'll done whatever supply give Wednesday  source data Moderna investors page, dude. point think he‚Äôs right.

Edit: least half-assed lockdowns like CA NY had. locked like Australia that‚Äôd different story would work I'm glad could get vaccinated providing good protection vs. COVID.

Perfect become enemy good, great news. 10-20 years entirely irrelevant since vaccines likely need re-administered every year year work healthcare setting Latino populations. experience, Latino patients take pandemic social distancing seriously white patients (less likely watch Fox News, likely protective elderly). culturally greater worry ‚Äúartificial‚Äù medications, addictiveness, side effects, unnatural treatments, etc. Vaccines less culturally normalized many Latino communities U.S. There‚Äôs weeks wait second shot full immunity response, it‚Äôs always 100% effective, limited support says even can‚Äôt get sick, can‚Äôt asymptotic carrier. probably participate gatherings others vaccine, besides that, go it.

""Latinos used generalization"" makes much sense saying deaths Italy attributed Boris Johnson hey, europeans generalization. could definitely possibility. Thanks. looks like comparison general population getting 0.65% still takes tweaking get 95% comparing 0.0156% that.

I've two knee replacements. consider good candidate testing lot people age group older issues. active seniors see romping many advertisements. good portion us money like travel. never thought nursing home residents needing shots, poorly paid workers move facility facility,,and better paid nurses traveling doctors come in,especially skilled nursing facilities. need get traveling people. go anywhere camping ( really socially distant!) Many folks age insistent good times. worked hard whole lives,and want fun can't.

Hey thanks vote literally said 70 55-59 brain couldn‚Äôt even handle minute increase flies face narrative bumped respectively make sound slightly worse. found hilarious. 

Anyways hate burst bubble there‚Äôs really way spin 70% effective vaccine variants bad thing supports covid forever mentality. Hell even 55-59% effective one doesn‚Äôt support that. Ugh. I‚Äôve emailed two different news organizations asking please stop using pictures people wearing masks incorrectly. reinforces stupidness. then? Masks distancing forever? that's happening. Except no, one wants shitty Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine. would agreed pre-pandemic, everyone working home, working ever have. work/life balance completely evaporated.  Well, let's compare FL's death rate per capita strict lockdown states NY CA.

Wouldn't better look case rate lockdowns meant slow spread prevent deaths? Anyways CA NY cases per capita NY deaths per capita, NY CA pretty comparable regard. CA higher excess death rate though. What? entire point lockdowns keep pressure healthcare system. anyone, including focused happening now. Take stroll imagination lane, world full ever aging boomer population, healthcare system devoid health care workers ignorance, vitriol lack empathy fellow citizens. That's world covid 'freedom' fighters created. Enjoy consolation seemed contract inside window full immunity happens.  Also vaccines seem really, really good preventing severe cases deaths. even outlier case, diminish effectiveness vaccine effort. Maybe use 50% doses sitting fridges, like, *now.* sure didn‚Äôt mean post /r/space? Sorry guy given vaccine? strike priority. one takes Mexican politics seriously since 90s especially Mexican-Americans. AMLO seen joke weak man. I‚Äôm loving good vaccine news lately! Canada could get shit together actually something vaccines  wait june 22 get would assume yes, think J&amp;J going producing rate higher Pfizer Moderna J&amp;J readily available two. also feel like J&amp;J going focused rural locations would suffer storage issues Moderna Pfizer.  Asymptomatic... Exactly point smart policy, covid transmit sweat Technically also increasing spread, small non infectious way Get us where? Well eating animals like bats normal thing China. would agree yes needs regulation China eating wild animals like bats, dogs, snakes, etc spread disease. However that‚Äôs really something old 2019 normal cultural thing. Everyone wearing masks Spanish masses. Catholics Christian fundamentalists. really problem whole schools argument. virus control US contact tracing useless now, there's way able show outbreaks came school somewhere else. see lot people acting like lack certain evidence means schools 100% safe, actually really idea. They're probably causing spread, also coming places, together adds gong show now. phenomenon certainly ubiquitous  still get sick covid pass others   people even k legitimate separate nation United States AstraZeneca‚Äôs vaccine Exactly feel well.

I'm longer allowed socialize basically anything fun outside house. still bills pay job worry about... Well anymore got laid due COVID last week. Source? news literally reported morning (Local news mainstream fox anything) 1.3% us popluation received full vaccine (1st 2nd)  

So basically one lol priority get everyone vaccinated shortest period time possible. ethnicity/race. 

Not biological predisposition cultural societal, socioeconomic etc effects due part ethnicity/race. know lmao. New York locked late first wave. didn‚Äôt much 2nd wave though.

No idea went wrong California tho.  No. Pfizer/BioNTech Moderna vaccines proven resist vaccine. watched, read decent amount articles journals it. sincere thank recommendation, honestly check out

But along lines, one favorite journals pandemic. conclusion chilling mistakes made. agree, fact published 2020 makes big EUs fault vaccine rollout shit guys? reason UK's working well sorted due Brexit - we're lucky enough vaccine invented pharmaceutical company setup manufacture UK. agreeing post it? currently middle largest outbreak they've experienced since pandemic began, borders still closed, still rolling lockdowns began close public transportation schools. following news there? closer normal us lol day one yet EVERYONE followed protocols could even start 14 day stretch?
That's problem.
Plus, learn virus behaves, learn better ways control spread obviously harsh know virus difficult.  I'm confused insistence young healthy get J&amp;J instead mRNA vaccines, primary function eliminate hospitalizations cases. Given ubiquity myocardial infarction ground glass opacities mild cases, goal prioritize young getting infected all, using J&amp;J help old die? 1.3% largely healthcare workers close contact shit ton sick people begin Funny ok kid go school antivaxxers kid efficacy childhood vaccines known.  

Don‚Äôt judge nurse unsure getting vaccinated brand new barely tested/studied vaccine. Many nurses young unsure child bearing years could effect unborn yet conceived children. 

They making conscious decision refuse delay vaccination. think shift judgement towards moronic antimaskers covid deniers fueling pandemic selfishness ignorance. 

Remember year nurses techs doctors lived shit simple fabric barrier pair plastic goggles protecting violent illness VACCINE now. go home families every day hoping don‚Äôt get loved ones sick worry finding antibacterial wipe clean cart grocery store. I'm extremely sorry, accurate language next time, senpai. Hell yeah! fact gloves required anywhere ridiculous, Unless CDC changed tune, issued statement months ago specifically saying wear gloves. No, course want live lockdown state forever. mean normal actions put us situation. 'normal' people eat bats. That's mean normal, maybe need take look got happen again. Normal actions brought us horrible situation, questioning wrong? question climate crisis, normal led us 6th mass extinction planet, continue normal go extinct 80 years. normal great? won‚Äôt. one would stupid enough damage local service economies flu. do. vaccines go waste.

Here's nuanced think weren‚Äôt daily thread I‚Äôd feeling extremely depressed hopeless. ever horse hospital?? want vaccine soooo badly ugh I'm patient though Interesting. don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs ‚Äúright‚Äù answer, least Sweden, want prevent highest number deaths probably focus vaccinating eldest fragile first. vaccination also goals preventing death, course. Isnt already reported strain south africa resistant vaccine? long go movies without mask really care around, long vaccines treatments relegate background noise cyclical typical human diseases.  Damnit. Well good news case asymptomatic guess? don‚Äôt agree decisions DeSantis made least know stands doesn‚Äôt move goalposts around like Cuomo Newsom. may like him, respect consistency. Sounds like Defense Production Act activated, Feds take Johnson &amp; Johnson's production lines, converted producing Pfizer Moderna.

Why poor folks always sacrifice greater good? Thanks man. Go ask local vaccination station extras haven‚Äôt gotten e yet. literally take away people's bodily autonomy death... think public health crisis going enough bend ethical medical rules? India already given million doses Middle East, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Bhutan etc may send African countries, South America Mexico too.

Though think take couple months India start exporting big numbers right priority get whole Indian population get vaccinated. Plus vaccine companies already working Boosters variants even really big deal.

I'm really worried variants.  Well put. Agreed. Maybe others thought saying obesity factor. disagreement commenter factor. Either way detailed complexity within latino community problem much larger weight issue. opinion appears piss everyone know. think parent vaccinate kid issue CPS. vaccination campaigns seem exception rather norm. 


Would rather quicker vaccination campaign less deaths per capita? Canada Germany may take longer they'll still likely lost significantly less. OK, first different complication unrelated fertility. Second off, seems like entirely new vaccine clear problems right studies company made it.

Meanwhile, Moderna says 94% efficacy ""the majority adverse events mild moderate severity"".

This sounds little potato potahto me... vaccine 66% effective 85% severe cases, vaccine 85% effective except mild cases...? helps one dose = one person. No, says. state BRE deliver refers manufactured EU.

I explained detail comment. Ah, makes sense. got vaccine today!   Show data supports conclusion. mask comes off. happened saving grandma? contract breached. 

Clearly not, EU would taking court instead trying make 'trial public'. /r/nottheonion? Ebay tones I'd inclined agree case anywhere else. Aus. wild levels restrictions police enforcement like months. Guess happened after? took masks mandatory ""strongly recommended"". 

Your fears based what's actually happened happening. Lots great sources. Thanks! 

This info may apply government official discussed infected prior vaccination. six times fewer, aka 100/6 * 1%. around 82% fewer antibodies. amount work increased

I think varies greatly depending job is. job slowed lot plus expectations much lower employees kids trying watch kids throughout day they're working. someone without kids, easily surpassing expectations  It‚Äôs really even surprising, seems mirror anecdotal public signup numbers reported. really surprising thing level resistance RNs given generally day day exposure. One life‚Äôs goals kids. Finally, good f-ing news. hope government doesn‚Äôt make getting vaccine mandatory. also hope stadiums, airlines, restaurants etc. make mandatory want use services.

This hard everyone - even without clinical anxiety depression. Chinese media smearing mRna vaccines.Nothing see here. here, people continue go hospital they‚Äôre familiar with, ambulances take emergency cases hospital capacity, insurance continue force patients in-network providers, etc. It‚Äôs problem see disingenuous argue invisible hand market bring healthcare prices people compare cost services different providers. It‚Äôs great thought theory, practically speaking see doesn‚Äôt make difference. Sanofi Europe producing vaccine. going help Biontech filling vaccine vials. Novartis going to.

Back September 2020 Biontech bought factory Novartis Marburg immediately started remodelling. Production start February.

Even piles money EU Germany needed four months. 

mRNA vaccines totally different beast. Existing vaccine facilities cannot produce throwing switch. point specific data justifies calling complications ""ubiquitous"", justify hyperbole another comment claims entire generation people facing chronic dangerous health conditions?

For example, generation U.S. encompasses 65-70 million people. really suggesting 65-70 million doomed lifelong health issues?

In particular reference ""ground glass opacities"", study corroboration beyond one doctor Texas Tech? 

I mean response snarky -- however, *do* mean there's room hyperbole overstatement we're *ever* going find path this.  Doesn‚Äôt show post history account.

Quite dirty r4r type posts tho. he's obviously stable condition? Happy hear that. think *anybody* forced take it, sounds like that's feel. think probably thought thread posts, thought posting bullshit good idea.

If talking r/politics, would actually agree, saying place propaganda wrong. Like hell, difference skeptic subs (where I‚Äôd assume he‚Äôs from) pro-vaccine, conspiracy theories, optimistic skeptic subs anti-vax, filled conspiracy theories, range balanced pessimistic. 3 stuff, sub skeptic subs similar. mean thats every pandemic ended craziest thought NY number largely initial explosion happened pre-lockdown. Since then, Florida double many deaths NY. know Pfizer vaccine efficacy would SA variant either. Apples oranges.

Call drastic, practical difference course action. Take whatever available quickly possible. Yes, virus transmission rate. always function environment. media seriously make articles every positive case vaccination?Nobody said 100% effective.95% efficacy means 5 100 ill protected.That's still remarkable number. Regardless need full compliance population plan work. wouldn‚Äôt happen US, enough reason imo. 

A country‚Äôs Covid plan needs framed space possible within given population. disconnect US government‚Äôs recommendations populace reason US poorly imo. Well raining can't lead horse water going do? moral responsibility alone known vaccine prevent transmission. Everybody's life different, I'm glad I've opportunity get vaccine begrudge anyone different opinion body. hope so! horrible slightly less horrible (compared countries, aside maybe brazil) mean still ""raging"".

Was it? said happened months ago, even mask mandate place? Maybe person get tested, people stuck waiting 3-5 days test. even know caught COVID job? See, there's contact tracing know, make assumptions. 

You're still caught Western individualist thinking; employer value life because, well, who's going stop them? stopping COVID? labor laws, laws must enforced, people almost always operate self-interest.

There's basically two groups people, group essential workers plus anti-maskers. group B people staying home avoiding people like plague. 


Group essential workers getting vaccinated anti-maskers probably it. group may attained herd mmunity.


The problem Group B left houses vaccinated yet. vaccinated stop potential spreading disease things start open back people home come another surge Group B. tragic that's happens people who've home whole year go thinking safe end dying rest immune. Canada plenty influence. thought rest world would work based kindness. That's works, though.

There‚Äôs heavily upvoted comments every thread Twitter screenshots reach front page Reddit time saying this. 

They want someone rage blame. Obviously anti maskers dumb though.  cells producing spike killed immune system producing foreign protein. different infected virus.

The power vaccine isn‚Äôt spike produced, rather fact body‚Äôs cells suddenly making foreign protein, simulates cell actually viral infection making viral protein. exactly sets immune system‚Äôs alarm bells. majority cells make spike immune cells called macrophages dendritic cells, job going trying get infected bringing back lymph nodes, probably muscle cells also make spike.

This isn‚Äôt novel situation. prior ‚Äúlive attenuated‚Äù vaccine uses idea. You‚Äôre injected horsepox virus (vaccinia isn‚Äôt cowpox, surprise!), first ever vaccine cells start making poxvirus proteins. They‚Äôre killed immune response poxviruses set up. true measles, mumps, rubella, varicella, rotavirus, live attenuated influenza, oral poliovirus.

But mRNA vaccines, able express one protein surface virus needs enter cells. mRNA can‚Äôt copy itself.* Even better, live attenuated vaccines take long time develop sometimes (like RSV), seems either over-attenuate don‚Äôt offer protection under-attenuate tend cause disease. None problem mRNA vaccine time SARS-CoV-2 genome published, people Moderna already candidate designed hours. Pineapple party! Made India Oxford/AZ vaccine. apparently middle ground. Who'd thought.  Oh yeah, interesting tidbit, knows sure means - would like think vaccines least helping situation. Constantly learning COVID!

Just another workday me! hope right. SA strain reverse trend here. explain graph me? N represent number people responded way? So, example, says 25.98 / N: 2943

Oh well, obviously people wearing masks. Whoever said clue. R0 would lower, meaning fewer infections fewer people getting sick time.

Go check CDC‚Äôs opinion piece directly. China might seeing resurgence virus, amounts 100 cases day. county 1.2 billion.

China's economy *grew* 2020. see merits argument worth sacrificing civil liberties able achieve China's response. downplay effectiveness response; fewer people dead less economic damage (these go hand-in-hand course) ignored 100 cases day now. Booster shots every year like flu already completel fucked March. Needed early February. H&amp;S POV correct. things average person change, than, ""Don't indoors strangers.""

IMO, engineering controls H&amp;S viewpoint silent. workplace safety departments approached ""infectious disease"" standpoint, something know little about. But, reality, indoor air quality problem, first line defense engineering controls, eg HVAC HEPA filtration increasing makeup air. administrative controls like masks, distancing handwashing need brought wearing nuisance masks - ie wearing actual half face respirators, goggles, etc high hazard environments, disposable plastic fiber masks fit well. abysmal lack safety protocols lost enormous numbers hospital personnel. literally re-invented respiratory protection safety - badly, say ""Oh, airborne microparticle causes disease, need use asbestos protocols.""

I safety person 25 years ago, whole thing frustrated me.

Casual, short duration exposure indoors fine masks, distancing handwashing. appropriate workplace exposures 8+ hours day. work public, would wearing half face respirator goggles. I'd probably catch shit it, that's actual H&amp;S response dose x duration analysis. Alabama Bob *is*the police.  get fucking flu vaccine.


Has everyone lost fucking minds? Think. get flu vaccine every year. people company get also. need shut state flu. Oh hello fellow pineapple! saw 80% awesome got too. Haven‚Äôt said anything yet feel may solidify decision getting it....  no, US Europe ‚Äúhoard‚Äù vaccines. Nobody stashes here, used immediately available.

I'm referring new law Europe allows stop export vaccine. number developing countries exemption list, Australia NZ make cut. domestic production lines, you‚Äôll get vaccines faster now. that, you‚Äôll get vaccines faster if/when COVID mutate.

Our govt says option us. small country that. rely getting vaccines imported. govt spent months assuring us deals signed would mean top list. natural people upset discover bottom list, months behind US Europe. 

We virus now, border system quite faulty least 10 failures cases entered community. South African strain escaped two separate incidents different parts country last week. barely averted third escape variant infected person developed symptoms day released quarantine (but passing 3 normal tests). incredibly lucky none 3 infected people spent 2 weeks contagious variant going malls, supermarkets etc. infected anyone else. next mistake could easily lead outbreak. restrictions NZ, masks, crowd limits. 

Our elimination strategy means another strict, economy crushing lockdown would required border fails vaccine. That's people keen it. every week trends. need look days week week. You‚Äôre amazing! Thank guys do. ""be less fucking stupid please"".

He already said would never work America Sorry, yes. poor? I'll sit Melbourne, watch guys debate effectiveness lockdowns.

[Don't mind think making bit stretch saying saying, element truth it. work, provided done correctly, time, not.

What actual goal lockdowns? Reduce infections? Hospitalisations? Total eradication? goal things, far, temporary measure.

Reopen society whole cycle begins again, without end, unless lived nation hundred cases most, geographically economically isolated, strict government shoot follow certain rules.

There also pressing matter conundrum subreddit suffers people believe 'good' states better 'bad' states, 'bad' states better. Despite supposed ide0logical and/or lockdown difference. I'm sure glad live unfree country Germany dropping numbers due lock down.  read opinion piece directly, CDC found schools high mask adherence + social distancing safer community settings, like unmasked church events/sporting events/mass indoor gatherings. didn‚Äôt say schools ‚Äúsafe‚Äù, said safer running around maskless crowds like plague rat. endless comments would people wore mask? It‚Äôs always complete nonsense. 

The 2 options end pandemic vaccines natural immunity. Absolutely nothing could done would made end sooner. Agreed. trash teir reporting. want stay inside alone next 3 years, go right ahead. soon I‚Äôm vaccinated restrictions end me. Asian countries, places like Nordic countries (Sweden excluded), took Swiss cheese approach worked extremely well.

Only West doubling binary thinking seen kind virtue. wish knew removed, think idea may been. 

Keep good work. don‚Äôt see could argue social distancing doesn‚Äôt hurt economy, unless mean spacing lines (that may cause annoyance). mean events kind, decreasing number people restaurants stores, waiting lines get places mitigation like that, I‚Äôd argue totally does. People stay home. That's happens develop something country.  section regarding Portugal:

Portugal reports seven free intensive care beds

8:25 p.m¬†.: Portugal, British Corona variant rampant according data Ministry Health, seven free beds intensive care Corona patients.

Of 850 beds mainland available Covid 19 patients, 843 occupied.¬†There also 420 intensive care beds ten million inhabitants, reserved cases illness.

According ministry, 12,435 new infections 293 deaths related virus recorded within 24 hours.¬†So far, 711,000 infections 12,179 deaths registered. Basically means need 6x many antibodies order bind antigen equal efficacy. (using easy made numbers here) antibody concentration 60 would effective new variant antibody concentration 10 old variant. 

In words, existing immunity would imperfect, nonexistent. Existing immunity would still likely provide protection keep getting severely ill, might prevent getting somewhat ill. Maybe direct anger government whoever responsible healthcare system state, fellow citizens.

Also dare put word freedom quotation marks. know like live world without it. It‚Äôs   Nobody seems asking why, cases dropped fast.

The¬†hospitalization rate¬†for COVID-19 six per 100,000 children ages 5 17, according CDC."" really great ideas put forth parents, teachers, students creatively mitigate risks covid still teach students class school ended last year. lot teachers, like super excited read felt safer knowing going proactive this. 

Our superintendent ignore them, lied parents school board, put survey teachers parents, never put Spanish fuck migrants (~35-40% demographics). took teacher survey cherry picked stats present parents... 

We iirc, 7th 8th largest district country, options presented us either quit teach sorry, going die year. teachers died, due contract tracing placed admin shoulders personnel cuts (our school lost 12 units 8 vacancies trying fill) never know school home. 

It make sad opportunity really make special fun year help counter death sadness surrounding students home lives. Instead making worse.

Side note, masks work. Normally would sick something twice. completely healthy year. yay. guess. And? UK already put ~¬£300m well then, vaccine already existed undergoing phsae 2 trials EU put penny in. 

They screwed late, loudly trying distract failures whining UK going help vaccinate people. Well worry. covid deniers, I've seeing net, morphing ""virus deniers"". Thats right viruses exist folks. ""misidentified tissues"" body naturally produces, like ""purging"". ""Viruses"" fake folks, better living needed. Plague rats everyone them. People can't social distance decade late lockdowns. Scientists better hurry come real solution. know downvoted Education caught up, assuming still alive.  
Hard teach someone who's dead, trying deal suddenly orphan parents dead, dealing grieving whatever family members dead, they're sick longer attend school.....  
To obvious, whether quit strike and/or friends grocery store; think crazy risk life nothing, though, maybe that's me. 'Cause frankly, I'd \*pissed\* someone told *had* risk life, choice whether could keep safe work. *seems* happening US. 


What hate see happen people trying make choice others. That's issues. Yeah, everyone audacity life across different countries put wall summarily executed. people ever dare live state permanent readiness world-wide pandemics?

You can't stop international travel year. That's gonna destroy lives millions people. Apparently, hurt yours, ever tried considering people? 65 get shots lot Michigan now, depending county in. Call every place giving vaccines county sign following directions. Nah Im wearing mask house. Thats flat absurd. proposals? I'm reading wall text crazy hypotheticals. Sorry.  Yeah schools two weeks, right? googled ‚Äúprivilege vs. right‚Äù order help articulate beliefs honestly can‚Äôt say better comparison Wikipedia page privilege:

UK provided far funding vaccine EU did, signed contract 3 months advancenof EU. got right.

 EU trying take vaccines UK here. Brexit also nothing it, even countries EU subscribe vaccination programme want to. one glad obviously cocked up. makes think action would warranted? UK done nothing wrong, none issues EU anything UK. strict lockdown 2-3 months failed 
I know pro-lockdown societies structured compliant authority. 
if attempted coup US doesn‚Äôt tell won‚Äôt last long. maybe 5 month lockdown follow civil unrest epic proportions tell it‚Äôs bad Idea. vast majority population virus BS Reddit community believes important thing. Unfortunately society lost fear virus lest likely listen find ways skirt rules It‚Äôs dictating though, it‚Äôd recommending. would important component this. mandate, voluntary recommendation. I'm saying HM nothing do. HM flouting sorts rules, one bats eye? post pics Bihar victory parade Delhi WB rallies HM sir? Blind support wrong. 2 wrongs equal one right *sings* 

Do hear Karens scream? blanket ban. EU regulators example, approved Pfizer vaccine even imported begin EU member states. far they've even approved Astra-Zenneca vaccine use EU nations one made Europe. Moderna approved. kind pissed EU USA leadership playing games country gets vaccine top said vaccines sent wealthiest cities countries first. EU fucked entire vaccination purchase, even managed make fool constantly back track contract negociations fiasco. utter farce ... 2 million children die Covid?

Covid-19 novel. Death rates exponentially higher new disease. Brushing flu understatement means know history.

Why people allowed go gym Christmas shop mall, kids can't go school?  Sure do. could better, influenza substantially less dangerous disease COVID-19*, yet whole song-and-dance every single flu season we're able give degree herd immunity right gate vaccinations.
 
\* want dispute this, please make sure equate ""the flu"" ""the common cold"". *Influenza kills people* flu shot similar. Almost exactly year ago assume influenza, going school time lazy get flu shot year. knocked fuck out, three straight days one worst fever I've ever had. roommates gotten flu shots case sniffles days after. That's we're talking covid vaccines ventilatior vs tissue paper. Reading comments, think large dispute going society June (or September you‚Äôre American Brit) going around risk comfort levels within population. 

I think article makes perfect sense. *In opinion* hospitalizations death rates decline start see life resembles pre pandemic life. understand *might* still long term effect risk get mild version covid - believe risks willing take get back life lived before.

Unfortunately everyone thinks way. people want eliminate risk together matter long takes people can‚Äôt go much longer ok risk long term effects. seems two camps clashing summer direction go.   know white people even equivalent public figure Tyler Perry, mostly much representation entertainment industry. Black folk Tyler Perry, Dave Chappelle, Chris Rock, that's pretty much it. Tyler Perry getting vaccine going pay dividends public trust among black community. Sorry, one's going that. sort guidance create lot people resent government ""they right dictate house"" way. Spring summer read conditional funding paragraph?

AstraZeneca allocated ‚Ç¨336 million public EU funding help development production vaccine collaboration Oxford University, exchange agreement supply EU 400 million early doses, part portfolio two billion doses pre-booked bloc bid halt pandemic.  serious ending spread then? sacrifice things asked? want grandma die? Selfish... Answer: national vaccination plans. countries like France squabbling *who* vaccinate first develop pretty complicated, bureaucracy-reliant schedules, Romania introduced reliable, robust plan oriented around three stages - first, medical industry (‚Äúfrontline‚Äù) workers, second, employees industries rely frequent face-to-face contact moderate large amounts clients, third, rest population. would pick picture dude wearing mask improperly? admit risk (the authors). However based backgrounds field feel risk justified give risk people initial inoculation sooner. 

Regarding liability - mean, companies state regimen followed obviously clear. That's entire point article. order generate solid data vast expanse possible delay times shot 1 2 we'd need possibly years additional trials. companies chose 2 likely arbitrary times confirmed work. advising one deviate evidence (and fact standard industry knowledge) would say delaying 8 weeks probably near equal efficacy would allow people covered likely bring spike save lives. 

We crisis. crisis need make decisions information often means weighing incomplete tough risk/benefit calls. I'm raising something interesting given mant people treating 21/28 day gaps absolute gospel anxious can't secure second dose exactly time may lose benefit. That's probably far true. Nah herd immunity thing yet.

Its probably related fact UK lockdown schools actually shut. oh yes absolutely did, Susan. Another significant potential limitation first wave SARS-CoV-2 vaccines reduced protection elderly. remains plausible risk writing would consistent behavior vaccines number diseases[30,32]. used modeling framework explore impact vaccine less effective elderly. Again, picture grim. example, vaccine 85% effective over-65 population, steady state, could expect around 400,000 deaths year (using assumptions 95% vaccine efficacy under-65 population, 80% compliance, 18 months natural immunity, permanent vaccine immunity R0 5.7; Fig. 2). vast majority deaths would occur over-65 population. Crucially, over-65 population, vaccine prevent transmission partially effective result never-ending pandemic. Beyond scope paper, clear implications age structure US population life expectancy general. choice made pursue SARS-CoV-2 elimination, however, existing vaccines still play positive role. current crop vaccines represents one layer ‚ÄúSwiss cheese strategy‚Äù [73‚Äì75], long made clear vaccinated individuals (counterintuitively)may face increased risk vaccinated returning pre-pandemic lifestyles. use analogy, wearing seatbelt reduces risk death driving, taken license three beers taking wheel. Public health messaging emphasize benefit vaccine offset actions taken individuals increase contact rate, compliance public health measures reduce transmission remain individual‚Äôs best interest. Crucially, public health strategy diversify approach, broadening focus passive interventions ventilation complementary biomedical interventions intranasal prophylactics. interventions stacked top successful vaccine program increase likelihood eliminating SARS-CoV-2 address risks evolutionary escape, reduced protection subpopulations, vaccine noncompliance, limited efficacy transmission. study current vaccines‚Äô performance characteristics (impact infection/ transmission, efficacy older vaccinees, durability protection, impact mortality morbidity) required better understand public health impact. Although possible current crop vaccines provide sufficient protection infection transmission achieve elimination, insufficient data support currently. much discussion regarding ‚Äúherd immunity threshold‚Äù corresponding fraction population must vaccinated achieve herd immunity [76].These discussions often neglect fact extent population immunity determined fraction individuals vaccinated effectiveness vaccine transmission infection. minimum threshold population requiring vaccination achieve herd immunity vaccine provides perfect sterilizing immunity, correspondingly minimum threshold vaccine efficacy infection transmission reach herd immunity entire population vaccinated. Perfect protection infection transmission consistent preclinical data vaccines [25],the frequency asymptomatic carriers AstraZeneca trial[6],or theorized ‚Äúmaybe 50%‚Äù reduction transmission described Moderna Pfizer Another key finding extensive person-to-person variation mutations affect serum antibody binding neutralization. instance, neutralizing activity several sampleswas reduced single mutations site E484, samples essentially unaffected E484 mutations. Similarly, mutations sites 443‚Äì450 loop (e.g., G446V) caused large drop serum antibody binding neutralization samples, little effect on-others. inter-individual heterogeneity compounded fact effects mutations sometimes changed time samples longitudinally collected individual.These temporal changes could due disproportionate decay one dominant antibody clonotype,or relative increase antibodies targeting epitopes I‚Äôd rather get covid. Luckily live GrownUpLand getting things best can. Tbh kinda funny. Especially children color lower socioeconomic status. cares year school affect earnings life. power old white care. Yes, media reported 60%, 40%, low 25%. reality, single number come AZ. already Manaus, people already achieved herd immunity dropping dead numbers like first wave new mutation known existing antibodies. South africa rather similar evasive contagious deadly original variants. Ok make wear nose. think point want get older folks vaccinated get lives go there. 
We learn live continue updating vaccines. vaccines working better. population lost patience can‚Äôt continue think population understanding reasonable governments need scale healthcare infrastructure vaccine research development get ahead this. American vaccine rollout made lot worse is


I‚Äôm sorry, disagree. someone living state 48 50 vaccine rollout, truly nightmare. one know high risk able much make appointment, let alone actually get it. And, make matters worse, doses become available, they‚Äôll going states top vaccine rollout they‚Äôre ones actually getting shots arms, that‚Äôs get people vaccinated (which pretty much be), leaves us states completely incompetent leadership position we‚Äôre stuck twirling thumbs knows long Username checks Great news. much suffering virus lockdowns UK right people UK deserve end ASAP. hope trend continues. Yes, stop, people stuff like indoor parties. lessens probability, like corona, wear mask. (and indoor parties)  24 countries (mostly European) higher infection rates Covid UK. European countries cannot held responsible poor health care UK causing higher death rate.
You ask why?
Did read article? see funding vaccine development provided EU conditional early orders available. 

Did also realize UK voted leave EU?
So want first tabs vaccine someone else funded. got right? us wealthy countries barely vaccines either.

**coughCanadacough** D00m3rz gonna D(.)(.)m! state made felony months back. reduced hospitalization death 85%. [severe EU provided funding vaccine


Yes. everyone else. UK paid lot money first development actual vaccine (since 2016 started MARS vaccine way conversion Covid), plants initial 100m UK wants first call


Why wouldn't, they? paid authorised first. bigger issue EU wanting jump queue despite 3 months behind voting leave EU.


Completely irrelvant. UK order international company, could done EU. 70% passed it?! Whoa fuck?! That's WAY high! Please stop, dude. Culture really. Latinos one obese groups. Definitely Yeah. fiancee keeps telling Christmas. think people potentially careful given spikes/new variants fact vaccine near. 

And 30% folks need flaunting rules likely got infected already. I'm super freaking worried right now; sister lives family Alabama found last night whole family fevers 'flu like symptoms' last two days.  
While say they've trying keep safe, one children back in-person schooling.... getting tested Covid, ... damn I'm worried. :( Right bottleneck manufacturing. Stop scientific evidence, allowed here. /s 2 dose vaccines tho Well, UK expects EU give vaccines (produced Biontech/Pfizer) send UK.

This simply global trade works. Countries order stuff companies countries, receive goods according contracts. UK receives Biontech/Pfizer vaccines produced EU that's contract Biontech/Pfizer. EU expects receive vaccines produced UK that's contract AstraZeneca. Preprint articles require higher degree scrutiny rigor accurately evaluate many types articles. kind discussion would appropriate strictly scientific subreddit /r/COVID19.

Rationale:¬†Much known acute infective process SARS-CoV-2, causative virus COVID-19 pandemic. marked inflammatory response coagulopathic state acute SARS-CoV-2 may promote pulmonary fibrosis. However, little known incidence seriousness post-COVID pulmonary pathology.

Objectives:¬†We describe respiratory recovery self-reported health following infection time outpatient attendance.

Methods:¬†Infection severity graded three groups: (i) requiring admission, (ii) requiring hospital admission, (iii) requiring ICU care. Participants underwent chest radiography six-minute-walk test (6MWT). Fatigue subjective return health assessed levels C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6, soluble CD25 D-dimer measured. association initial illness abnormal chest x-ray, 6MWT distance perception maximal exertion investigated.

Results:¬†487 patients offered outpatient appointment, 153 (31%) attended assessment median 75 days diagnosis. 74 (48%) required hospital admission acute infection. Persistently abnormal chest x-rays seen 4%. median 6MWT distance covered 460m. Reduced distance covered associated frailty length inpatient stay. 95 (62%) felt returned full health, 47% met case definition fatigue. Ongoing ill-health fatigue associated increased perception exertion. None measures persistent respiratory disease associated initial disease severity.

Conclusions:¬†This study highlights rates objective respiratory disease subjective respiratory symptoms following COVID-19 complex multifactorial nature post-COVID ill-health. former football star ex-convict wore face mask nickname ‚ÄúThe Juice‚Äù printed across front injected vaccine distribution site Las Vegas , Nevada. rollercoaster televised trial subsequent acquittal, Simpson pursued courts Mr Goldman‚Äôs family brought civil case won. one post replaced mittens worn Bernie Sanders inauguration, another user zoomed practitioner‚Äôs hands showing ill-fitting surgical gloves: ‚ÄúOne again. there. come on, closer end beginning Unless mainly vaccinating twenty somethings cannot explain much larger drop group compared others. risk keep school? sent kids school decades knowing exposed mono, flu, pinkeye, etc. say? Maybe liked better way? J&amp;J vaccine like 60% effective variants? ‚ÄúThe preliminary data indicate vaccine effect first dose younger adults older adults 80. effect seems increase time,‚Äù said. 

This means J&amp;J vaccine great help 66% efficacy Pfizer 52% Moderna 80.2% one dose. J&amp;J running trials confirm efficacy improves second shot though. keep kids school danger kids, kids get it, fine , give older family members fine. mention teachers adults schools bring home families. 

If people get vaccinated large numbers concern goes way down. problem links, assumes precautions taken. work school physically impossible take precautions. Thus. Apart shutting school ever 2 weeks (cause governor said circumstances) teaching year looks lot like poster. 

Plus, kids obviously sick something coming parents want tested means positive, would home 2 weeks.

I'm curious they'd come second wave, looks like they're using data September 14. example, Wisconsin 1.5%, Youyang's lower range 4.1% September 14. confirms hypothesis older children also human everyone needs vaccinated 1.1 million confirmed cases. I‚Äôm sure metrics using determine spread case number.   existing law regulation transportation. takes time quality checks factories. dads pharma mrna tech new every facility equipped right protocols. takes tme make sure going produced correctly definition, things always absolute worst start get better I'm saying black white, even ""lockdowns"" hospitals many heavily populated areas still capacity care covid patients.

Both things bad.

The big takeaway continue be: ""we shut 60% country year thick headed individuals greedy businesses 2 weeks year ago"" Protip: Try follow comment thread start I‚Äôm also allergic penicillin haven‚Äôt heard this. Source? pre-lockdown age group likely go active catch virus.

Now due lockdown they're movements restricted experienced biggeat drop infections.

Here Sweden, less average, vast majority vaccines far went people 90 fucked.

Actually majority population takes virus seriously - see people dying, overrun hospitals. Unfortunately people like spreading propaganda gets undue attention. personal gain? part conspiracy? ignorant? personal opinion, teacher really wants teach online. love working kids interacting watching grow.

They asking schools help mitigate risks. 

No one saying ""we want teach kids"" never message. message manipulated into. saying ""we want die something could easily prevented""

[They work really 

Even Astrazeneca vaccine, [heard 8% (That figure totally inaccurate.)

But excited vaccine that's less effective 90%+ Moderna/Pfizer? Excellent question! [Absolutely 

The vaccines given EUA safe even hear [about someone dying crazy side [work safe super smart super rich [people paying cut get them. safe effective, people paying much access vaccines.

There‚Äôs thing [vaccine side effects take months years show side effect, [it shows right Phase 2 trial participants vaccine 6 months, [no lingering, [delayed side virus worse getting vaccine. Getting vaccine better getting virus.

The currently approved vaccines work [new variants, Even new one [you read [very [not going 

 feel free ignore news story blog comment uses word ‚Äústrain‚Äù instead ‚Äúvariant‚Äù. [There currently Covid19 ‚Äústrains‚Äù, variants great viruses. [Some already gone rate extinction probably increase time. Yes, mink variant worried last year probably gone forever.

 Reinfections exceedingly rare, [like less 1 (maybe 1 10,000 range). rare cases happen, reinfections seem milder previous infections. 

Milder cases, especially asymptomatic cases [are worse spreading therefore follows even less effective vaccine still reduces symptoms might reduce transmission. 

Plus, [studies using show strong immunity exposed, sterilizing immunity multiple vaccine types. means monkeys unable spread virus vaccinated, virus take hold bodies.

Looks like [Pfizer's vaccine may also prevent addition preventing disease.

Immunity vaccine [comparable better immunity infection.

If virus able evade vaccine induced immunity, would likely also evade immunity generated infection, leading lot reinfections. We‚Äôre seeing lot reinfections.

Immunity clearing infection lasts [*at least 8 though [probably lot soon say ""lifelong"" [that vaccine [lasts *at least 6 probably lot, lot longer, probably many years.

I think lot them, though. Anecdotal evidence data, pretty much everyone know itching go back work, Broadway puppeteer restaurant busboy. takes time distribute vaccines first days itself, India started testing Coronavirus people criticised country carrying little testing compared population, number people tested second US. take time distribute vaccines reduce vaccine hesitancy. Govt laid plan vaccinate abt 500 million people within year.lets hope goes plan I‚Äôm unions stretch CTU historically unpopular Chicago  J&amp;J vaccine sucks compared Pfizer's Moderna's, though, results. yeah, still lots better nothing, guess. willing take shitty 65% effective vaccine? Wow Anyone think. doctors equal ability come famous black person underlying health conditions. 

The point making really any. Tyler Perry, Dave Chappelle, Beyonce, Chris Rock, Samuel L Jackson, Jamie Foxx, Chris Brown, Chris Tucker. 

Fuck, proved wrong. Samuel L. Jackson 72, definitely puts risk/priority group. I'm pissed say ""get motherfucking shot! J&amp;J zero credibility thousands lawsuits alleging talc caused cancer, J&amp;J insists safety purity iconic product. internal documents examined Reuters show company's powder sometimes tainted carcinogenic asbestos J&amp;J kept information regulators public.‚Äù

As far others, I‚Äôll continue keep eye unfolds. I‚Äôm wrong, good. understand still talking big pharma here. stop nothing push product gain, even pandemic. govt undoubtedly back up. Keeping Americans safe push remember wealthy priorities lie. Thus right here. supply longer issue sure lets pick choose lets give whatever vaccine available.

Cleaning easier cleaning humidifier, it‚Äôs cheaper allergy meds, side effects. States going start closing borders. outcome would happened regardless, AZ never going fix production issues; mean would serve interests? 

Instead quiet mediation process contract dispute EU caused huge amount reputational damage; caused concern allies like Japan, Korea Australia vaccine supplies; drawn criticism groups like International Chamber Commerce; minimum introduced new layers red tape vaccine exports; angered Ireland UK, potentially causing huge incident, mistakenly invoking hard board RoI NI; possibly opened legal issues accidently publishing unredacted copy AZ contract. probably over. monumental diplomatic balls EU entirely avoidable. They're charging money COVID test kits free... 100% need hospitalized. Mostly.  NY/NJ constrained vax supply. 

There large centers delayed openings due supply. 

Expanding vax supply information 3 weeks vs short notice big logistics help. 

A big chunk undistributed vax LTC can‚Äôt released general population. think CVS contract teams going around LTC bit slowly. honest you, I‚Äôm socialist much support direction China taking. recently nationalized alibaba today sentenced corrupt billionaire death. becoming increasingly difficult argue China capitalist state even eradicated poverty months ago.

I would support type law like would save many many lives.

For contrast, country US data scientist jailed guns pulled children told truth coronavirus Florida.

As soon Xi found coronavirus acted quickly full transparency.

Trust me, ‚ÄòChina bad‚Äô bandwagon many many years. vowed never visit China fear political oppression. looking realized original assessment China based told government propaganda incorrect. Thanks much link, it‚Äôs great overview basic science developments made mRNA vaccines.

Never knew it‚Äôs big deal there. heard NZ different many ways, much? mean, it‚Äôs bad, least don‚Äôt thousands infected people every day hundreds daily casualties, let alone death toll rival WWII. That‚Äôs good thing.. imagine, gotta exhausting stuck.. digress, situation, yeah. single shot J&amp;J sound like good plan, considering culture around it. 

But honestly don‚Äôt think mRNA outright superior way. Gamaleya bullshitting us noisy raw data, adenovector vaccines heterologous prime-boost scheme efficient mRNA. studies horizon, well‚Äôll find soon enough.
As now, think technologies roughly potential, different pros cons. would disregard vaccines pure hype mRNA. don‚Äôt get ‚Äúeither 90% immunization mRNA total eternal lockdown‚Äù attitude, especially considering difference either nonexistent 5-10% tops. Hecc, even 66% single shot help healthcare systems overload dramatically. it‚Äôs unlikely it‚Äôs even supposed one shot vaccine. It‚Äôs study shows specific use case. bet journalists tempted turn ‚ÄúJ&amp;J = 67%, even trust politicians buy it‚Äù, life. result bad actually measures. 
Also take lot time Pfizer/Moderna deliver enough mRNA vaccines New Zealand order vaccinate 90% population. Purchasing one thing, delivering another, timing crucial. Time equals fatigue. way, good timing important 90%+ efficacy. 
But Pfizer slower end, afraid, way us know long current vaccines going last. don‚Äôt mean immunity, mean design. damn horrible wait full year lockdown prevent outbreaks, wait another one waiting shot, get it, achieve 90% vaccinated people Pfizer aaaand... Encounter new ‚ÄúSARS-CoV-3‚Äù mutated S-protein care current antibodies, requires new vaccines prevent it. another lockdown go, wait another 2 years new vaccine. Repeat ad infinitum. way prevent circle doom happening speed things up, country diversify sources. I‚Äôd hate myself, case absolutely outrageous. 
That‚Äôs NZ does, looks it. makes sense me. 

P.S.: gotta ask people, downvotes? nice person shared concerns compatriots here, believe respect that, instead smashing downvoting oblivion. know, know, people lost close entire country several months, come on. really efficient lockdown policy, one loose several family members like concerned corona. Worked psychology 28 yrs. yes right...the bump road professionals be...eg. sex offender group session led female mini skirt, speak gone, family support economics capitalism also factors. Think people insisted gathering holidays caught Covid died it. 

This 6 months, they're dead forever. And, people infected live guilt rest lives.

Glad selfish. lot people say events January 20th (wink wink). However think realizes state running money needs scramble save starts crumbling ground.  really don‚Äôt want get argument this, I‚Äôm going guess many people gene therapy. I‚Äôd guess people received mRNA vaccine point gene therapy. lot black healthcare workers. Tyler Perry convince people staff grandma‚Äôs nursing home, I‚Äôm it. I‚Äôd sure love high capacity vaccine manufacturer Canada. I‚Äôm thinking variants need MULTIPLE vaccines years least. Oh Canada, please little common sense here? little future planning please? Lol ""destroys"" second time I've seen anti-vax posts. Quit bullshit. Vaccines work variants. J&amp;J spokesperson said vaccine could ""end pandemic"". Pfizer, Moderna, JJ incredible production contracts US Biden admin. ambitious vaccination goal. majority eligible Americans planning receiving vaccine can.

All say is: seems promising. Let‚Äôs hope Moderna Pfizer don‚Äôt slow bc I‚Äôm skipping J&amp;J‚Äôs sub par bs vaccine. lip fillers? certainly issue, lip fillers interact virus apparently saying CDC stopped past 10 months? Hmmmm mean like stadium air conditioning despite high temperature summer would likely affect athletes audiences‚Äô health? Oh, don‚Äôt worry decided plant morning glories apparently ‚Äúcool temperature visually‚Äù. may sound like joking I‚Äôm not. Anything government touches delays mismanaged, no. Nah prefer women crust Don‚Äôt realize God control like think, vaccines also part God‚Äôs plan? It‚Äôs like story devout man flood turning away help comes way insists god save him. One point variant widespread J&amp;J studies , means comparing apples apples.  words, study Pfizer Moderna S. Africa today sure percentages would much lower size Australia i.e approx 25 mil pop, never able self sufficient critical items globalized world.

Better go trying fuck neighbours key trading partners east southeast asia US master wants see action.

Scott Morrison Mini Trump Australia needs go. One point variant widespread J&amp;J studies , means comparing apples apples.  words, study Pfizer Moderna S. Africa today sure percentages would much lower wait, keep waiting then. everyone frontline workers.

The last admin really tanked playing behind. even month. 

JNJ 3rd make easier meet lofty goals new administration has. people vaccinated good thing. 

And JNJ version allow supply locations might able right without cold storage.   unplug freezers spoil vaccines /s  Honestly? let die. Recovering must hell. Plus, someone else deserving gets lungs. might far back think. Im eligible nj mid 30s health issues mean least foresight set operation warpspeed (terrible name). knew America never going get rid virus containment, herd immunity would take long even though administration peddling - put eggs vaccine basket quickest way return country normal Exactly, it‚Äôs plenty people younger side, take 95% get 60-70% (and total protection hospitalization/death) huge boost. Ripoff. Thats is. Like every medical treatment US.

Why $150?? free paid government idea eradicate early detect covid. dont use facebook dude.

We're already nearing natural herd immunity begin with. 60% efficacy vaccine 100% efficacy keeping hospitalizations adequate. 

fuck off. testing mixing matching vaccines. reason would less safe, every reason believe would effective.  would I? received vaccine around 9:30am Thursday. Vaccines grown, synthesised chemicals. would like farm issue planting crops, could fix issue, fix result increase current crop cycle, next crop cycle. Right, that's probably good strat. Hopefully he's promising turn thing around. consensus vaccines anyone wants one Summer. Early Autumn good concerts. least tell stay sane. supported science all.  sh*t. year later wake up? Better late never Wait. I've waited year already. It‚Äôs even worse that-think people insisted gathering holidays infected killed essential worker taking ever single precaution could keep others safe.

I don‚Äôt want anybody die get sick anticipate tipping point people taking seriously vaccinated, majority new sick dead reckless whole time. least ones idiotic ones paying price. Well then, like influenza, risk factor groups, take vaccine, others maybe not?

I'm still really worried vaccines such.
We wont enough vaccines least year anyway (worldwide).
My worry eventual, long term change mutations worse variants. adjusts fall 2021 prediction normalcy kinds factors take account considering performance. Population density number one. influenza taken hit fitness already many years ago.

Sure, really change point mutation characteristic contributes need yearly flu vaccines (in agreement point previous truth much middle, variant fever daily headlines. 

Again agree here. far data favored current vaccines, definitely need vigilant vaccinate quickly. Like said, immunity have, pressure put virus. would interested see comparisons pressure reduction mutation opportunities increased immunity. 

I read much increased replication rates, know D614G mutation spike protein lead increased ability infect believe larger replication numbers iirc, since read it. I'll check out.  Remember said want worse flu would gone week fucking tape damn guy brought Nixon bragging it‚Äôs much worse flu loves downplay vaccine. want talk division defending guy called democrat hoax made masks political issue like total jackass. guy know nothing months months work vaccine instead working illegally overturning election lost instead. Yeah dumb bleach injecting lot lost trust many many times constantly lying get fuck outs loser  Ha! Walz holds press conferences complain it‚Äôs Trumps fault instead getting figured out. lottery fucking joke criminal.   saying 74% effective nbc news?  Outside overall ‚Äúflatten curve‚Äù strategy, masks don‚Äôt anything. Esp cloth ones. strategy developed. wish could get sooner , wish could get now.  prepared last administration

I hope roll age group Florida F knows DeSantis  that's yes? Mayoclinic get COVID-19 vaccine even I've already COVID-19?

Getting COVID-19 might offer natural protection immunity reinfection virus causes COVID-19. clear long protection lasts. reinfection possible COVID-19 cause severe medical complications, recommended people already COVID-19 get COVID-19 vaccine. you‚Äôve COVID-19, might delay vaccination 90 days diagnosis. Reinfection virus causes COVID-19 uncommon 90 days first infected. Brazil variant : hold beer way...mRNA vaccines future. I'd take choice Herd immunity good strategy ‚îÄ long virus prone *mutating*. virus static, never assumed so. 

From I'm seeing, virus mutate bypass herd immunity, vaccines.  Biden's team catches up, would rather quickly then. Positive PCR tests cannot tell gave COVID, even whether really COVID, especially case never display symptoms. viral RNA may indicate presence infectious virus 2019-nCoV causative agent clinical symptoms. p.  Yes, say initial immunity, get vaccine. Last heard getting Walmart Greatvalue vaccine. Meh. care take one yearly. can't locked like forever. received vaccine Thursday, would highly unlikely cause allergic reaction today. 

The components vaccine usually cleared body within 24 hours reactions happen within 15 minutes vaccination. Nope. mentally preparing future. based states cities bungled distribution, probably 2022 Well he's wrong, I'm somewhat impartial, I'm even American, smh distance... first report saw 56 percent would get it‚Äôs gone since then. companies like airlines Disney world start requiring think could realistically hit 80 percent. anti masker relative got go work without mask. That's really gross. people could actually afford still pay bills? might access JNJ. require deep cold keep viable. means places store without special upgrades. could get JNJ wait 3 months longer one ones, do? got Moderna jab last Sunday jazzed take part new technology get vaccination. look back say, remember used dead pieces virus create vaccines? Crazy! mayor LA complaining enough vaccines

no, dumbass... California still half supply left, fucked distribution!!! fuck would change CalVax Carbon Health VACCINATION PHASE?!

people got first shot idea get second

YOU TEN MONTHS SET UP!!!

YOU FAILED! STOP BLAMING TRUMP! got mine Army california. Let public workers it! didn‚Äôt lie. said masks won‚Äôt keep getting infected. That‚Äôs true. started recommend part flatten curve strategy, slow transmissions rates public places limiting far infected person project virus. horizontal line curve chart represents emergency room capacity. Distancing mask wearing throttling tools control rate infection. That‚Äôs all. two controls, distancing effective costly. Masks allow moderate distancing. walk cloud covid, mask won‚Äôt much. bad efficacy much lower Moderna Pfizer Could please break Sinovac efficacy me? really displeased heard may 50,4 % efficacious. also heard numbers. Could explain compares vaccines? Coudn't agree more! Lol I'm keeping Moderna CEO thinks could potentially couple years. addressed new comment thread.  Riverside County 
population 2.47M
Confirmed Covid cases: 0.270M. 
Total cases assuming 4.6 multiplayer: 1.242M. 
*Estimated infection: 50%. *

See source 4.6 multiplier. think bit high California avoided poorly-detected 1st wave. think 30-40% infected reasonable estimate sadly CDC done atrocious job accurately measuring infections beyond meta studies. math 10M LA county get almost conclusion ~40% infected. India produce it. Serum Institute India, also manufacturing AZ vaccine made deal produce novavax vaccines well. They'll start stockpiling August, Novavax signed deal Pune-based Serum Institute, produce minimum one billion doses vaccine candidate, approved, low- middle-income countries India. Later, US drug developer doubled potential COVID-19 vaccine manufacturing capacity two billion doses still committed stamping 'spreading rumours' happy maintain grey-zone counts truth (whatever CCP eventually endorses politically convenient), rather simply allow free exchange information. Censorship still order day.

&amp;#x200B;

As faux Marxist regime CCP stuck trying live early 20th century Communist rhetoric unmistakably capitalist autocracy. need time machine, need learn (and stop ignoring) political lessons 21st century favour economic ones. It‚Äôs ineffective vaccine don‚Äôt feel like dealing it. flu vaccine mean. I‚Äôve also never flu I‚Äôm nearly 30. Definitely possible especially J&amp;J EUA. typification rather reality that's always true. FDA asserts US population distinct enough set variables foreign data generally insufficient. There's reason Novavax applying EUA readout J&amp;J is- former completed American trial best make sure lasts forever... Americans without health insurance feels normal soft like silk...just keep rinsing... happy hear people Florida starting care coronavirus. seemed could care less it. Walgreens know call leftover dose? wait list? mean, coronaviruses *don't* mutate easily influenza. we're giving tons opportunities so.

It's like saying ""oh, getting 1 20-sided die rarer 6-sided die"". Well yes, roll hundreds millions 20-sided dice, get lot 1's! really surprised learn it. space, bring people *an extremely contagious disease spread others* unless necessary. Whatever- healthy kids get access adults given chance. want start seeing people lose shit other? Try letting kids - lowest risk population- skip list. Forget two sides business. Restaurant workers aren‚Äôt even eligible yet. space, bring people *an extremely contagious disease spread others* unless necessary. Hoping sign moderna pediatric trial soon. like think I‚Äôm helping Awesome! find Wednesday vaccinated back September. That‚Äôs what‚Äôs man. I‚Äôm working self discipline begin studying exam :/ Wtf means? found mean there, agree. 

Good Canada AZ one, PfiZer Moderna vaccines seem effective. Yes absolutely. hmm yes didnt think way, good point. im 29 maybe would make sense 1 shot im vaccinated sooner &amp; stronger vaccine goes high risk person talked expats tell life cities live feels normal. agree almost one masks anywhere.

Data... data?. 

I post videos accurate since biggest city sweden reflection rest regions.

I one see it. go see total normality. masks anywhere. matter anecdotal evidence fact. need divert attention reality that's norm. Would like thank dude offering science like human lab rat. Thanks brother. Americans tired world‚Äôs punching bag. problem us we‚Äôll take vaccines back go figure shit. 15 year old daughter Pfizer adolescent trial last month us sign new paperwork saying study could unblinded next couple weeks. took mean must getting close submitting FDA. implying first world countries Top 5 deaths per million universal health care system? remember seeing insanity like 40 million deaths floated Make people stop drinking smoking unprotected sex marriage, too.

Also, swearing. EU funded vaccine hundreds millions EUR. want benefit tax money decided good Union? filthy colonizer, always filthy colonizer living backs others feeling entitled it! Remember graphics March said we'd overload hospitals many times capacity unless Wuhan-style lockdown? severe case great, still don‚Äôt know long term health effects moderate cases. People seem think mild case cold. It‚Äôs not. Alien Grays finally took pity us.  True, luckily number people want increasing lately. total vaccinations still low really much effect total cases, really might affecting hospitalizations earlier given really getting point non negligible portion risk population least one shot vaccine. talking California state weather good* year. 

* Weather Bay Area (esp NB) suck. US 28 million doses delivered probably find demand flagging June. We're likely put Canadians ahead ‚Äî tense political climate makes suicidal even mention ‚Äî polite hat almost definitely first priority feel shots spare. 

Just based scale US production degree seem beating world, seems fair guess definitely hit third milestone probably second, probably first. logistics supplying Canada US practically easy; nearly whole population within couple hours' drive US border. heads up, Novavax phase 3 still recruiting 65+ 65 risk factor (like way part science, 66% getting vaccinated now, get paid (something like $1,200 2 years) Canada Pharma companies? setting manufacturing never option? Absolutely not, reason expect booster year two anyway. Happy keep upvoting long keep posting it. think would great thing someone new coming thread see first thing, least they're sorting top. live United States. recently switched jobs paperwork got messed still don‚Äôt health insurance. dry cough, stuffy nose started feel little short breath. get test? Everywhere seems asking insurance, don‚Äôt yet. widely circulated covid predictions (over course 2020) ended dead wrong? look numbers.
the anti vaccers statisticly matter all.
People keep looking country numbers.
But world population matters.
Before even vaccinated billion people, 3 billions infected. rest follow.
10 million anti vaccers dont matter, 6 billion people never getting vaccine (in time) anyway.
rest assured, go away. There's boat load assumptions comment. came back 6 months Mexico. take temperature everywhere got sick would hard travel out. Uhhh FYI really many restrictions Texas. Stay home suggestion here. known better message coming state ""carry usual"". Hey look, plz do. YOU...CAN...NEVER...BE...TOO...CAREFUL Spoken like someone believe physical activity. Lock downs accomplishing nothing. Florida evidence need. Everything, including bars clubs max capacity since summer worse state. really... u really put visual there... take upvote! one ends bust, terms long term immunity, seems like fixed booster.

Here's arm. it. Got shots rabies kid dog bite night dog never found. got weaker arm shot still made pretty ill. Yeah rabies untreated kill basically anyone. literal theft. Stealing stealing even later return stolen goods. 

The EU hypocritical lying incompetent mess? surprise me, many. ouch sorry hear  I've blowing months now. believe AZ, exactly newcomer pharmacy, able plan shelf life products fit orders accepted?    Love man! Cool, already covid,should still vaccinated? can‚Äôt imagine living life like vaccines tested mutliple countries? Unless trials conducted Chinese scientists, seem likely CCP could falsify data. Gotta keep going back fear well eyeballs clicks. Sooo hold years find out?? Hell, Reddit sees nothing wrong forcing people stay locked indoors support all. all, safely ensconced cushy little work-from-home jobs need worry security, ergo problem. Stick right Deep‚Äôs gills.  Reddit. Everything blamed EU ;) There‚Äôs real danger ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs point vaccine‚Äù attitude going catch on. Right it‚Äôs threats masks distancing 2023. message going work. Isn‚Äôt Vitamin deficiency correlated worse COVID outcomes? billions yet infected. think people willing overall months gone lots people get vaccine. I‚Äôve seen happening people know. Doses.or enough many people. get divided two full vaccine ? States currently handling allocations individual centers. guess federal government would handle allocations shipments federal centers.

Don't forget, big issue Biden given numbers inauguration still playing catch what's shipped. also make process continue slow actually figure going on. option would halt start scratch, also really good idea. Could Pfizer change 2nd dose better combat mutation vs. extra booster shot? professional business large order prepare stockpile able complete order agreed time. 


Blaming buyer case, makes absolutely sense.  belong prison, rioter Raw vegan. One meal month. Yaweh fasting bust may all.your offered. somehow decide gets mrna gets other. always storage either like remote towns get easier ones store ship. local politician decide federal.governemt allowed to. still uneven state state. Even makes sense prefer RNA vaccines. one introduces foreign viral mRNA cells too. uses cold virus instead droplets oil. 'DNA mutation' risk would (and fact zero both, anyways).

But tell them, they're happier way. want 66% efficacy. running supply bottlenecks likely; lot places finally getting distribution networks set distributed backlog supply hand probably giving get them. guess ‚Äústay home‚Äù would better phrasing. I'm really hoping works way. one shot, special storage. boonies, going useful evidence vaccinated people spread virus anything like rate unvaccinated people. Countries eliminated/effectively controlled COVID like Taiwan, NZ, Australia get lot credit, India really shining star this. First, able control effectively densely populated country, impressively low case/death numbers per capita. managed pretty effective testing relatively poor country (test positivity &lt;10% even peak). they're willing/able share millions vaccines neighbors. end day think people look back India gentle giant pandemic. time projections based two vaccines. another two three hit market may make lost time. multiplier around 10 early pandemic around 3 immediate round testing. seen presentations numbers primary references. USA average 4.6 according CDC, agree LA lower. 

Your seroprevalence link early November number confirmed cases tripled since then. don‚Äôt think unreasonable believe value increased 14% back 30-40% now. 

In terms double peak, definition herd immunity, R drops 0.99. Increased travel results number 1.0 cases rise again. unstable system minor behavioral changes enormous effects cases, population regains herd immunity. value R = 1.1 means cases double seven weeks isn‚Äôt brought due increased amounts resistance. 

With vaccine rollout, R plummeting relatively quickly see major reemergence virus finds way overcome resistance. true! Also, woman extra layers safety aware one meeting public space meeting someone 1st time. public spaces right really safe in, beyond worrying regular safety meeting stranger private setting add ""Do take mask usage seriously"" list things consider. And, maybe me, really hard maintain convos online people right now. crazy like lonely want kind intimacy MANY things going considered, safety safety everyone come contact with, like much work invest dating all. live US currently vaccines choose from. live access, actually multiple choices? 4th wave simply going look like one experienced.  Nova Scotia dope. Also covid cases. forefathers chose wisely ;) ""The mRNA enters healthy cells process developed Moderna.""


Ok, wrap RNA fat (lipid) allowing entry cells. Cells produce protein spikes look like coronavirus spikes. Body makes antibodies. Done.


So someone allay concerns cells health making spikes body basically attack get immune system make antibodies.


Turning cells Franken-cells. Surely knock-on effects. Who's talking effects? cells replicate, part delivered RNA passes cell lineage? long term effects that? totally agree. found shocking many coworkers going ""wait see"" getting vaccine. makes glaringly clear care themselves. understand countries banning travel due presence different strains, anyone else think plan requires new strains/variants coming country basically doomed start? unrealistic IMO act assuming mutate constantly. like phased rollouts, smart way distribute vaccine via age groups

""20-50 year olds far likely exposed virus"" - due stupidity, someone 55 less likely exposed someone 40 ?

Giving JJ vaccine people low risk Pfizer/Moderna high risk smart.  dont think statement ""20-50 year olds likely exposed"" valid think stupid carefree puts higher risk category vaccine rollout 100% -- ""Just common cold"" clock anyones radar life would resume part. Removing/minimizing hospitalizations whole ""theres real chance dying getting long termed fucked up"" aspect, we're generally back normal life.  That's one reasons people decide it. Different people willing accept different levels risk. Nursing home work zero cases among staff residents since first round vaccines. got second round last week well. Morale way results caused vaccine doubters among staff sign next vaccine round two weeks. Definitely light end tunnel Oh Canada.. forefathers Nova Scotia cacophony. Given close ties head Xi, expected. already started peddling narratives ""not expect much findings"" called dumny investigations. Let guess 25% opted vaccine? That's facility. think absolutely unconscionable, short staffed I'd say unwilling get vaccine (with logical exceptions valid health reasons) suspended pandemic ends. willing vectors every one. Oh good! Hope Casey Anthony top list too! Worse people questioning mitigation, demanding world act would better Covid ran course, crapping vaccines spreading anti vaccine info ‚Äújust bad worse‚Äù? Nahh

J&amp;J seems pretty good I‚Äôd wait weeks make phone calls get moderna Thats really fun way get reelected. Don‚Äôt worried always prepared probably 1-2% imho, California 30 million doses administered, nearly 10%.. Ok actually enforce way true, people mean it. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* seeing articles ""sort effective""(66% claimed). Glad see actually showing promise. Honestly, story doesn‚Äôt matter whatsoever. currently many people refusing take vaccine altogether. I‚Äôm honestly expecting situation 60% adults become infected covid, remaining 40% take vaccine protected. Based this, could probably achieve goal April. never disappointed US population adult life last 5-6 years. good, it‚Äôs still need get like 70% better achieve herd immunity. keep wearing mask whole bit. We‚Äôll get there. 900 million vaccination‚Äôs purchased US far. Theoretically, think there‚Äôs truth idea flu rates plummeted year due masks social distancing? 

I live pro-lockdown state, NJ, feel like there‚Äôs evidence back Covid precautions saved people flu last two months, governor gonna push every year I've trying say this, get downvoted lol People believing take vaccine everything fine normal... get normalcy back 2019. normal need able finally host wedding Canada without gathering limits American guests. apparently next year, dear god please. think elderly true, 5% chance die corona even vaccine side effects probably lower 5%.

For young, good question... 0-19 age group 0.003% corona fatality ratio (""CDC best estimate""), happen vaccine side effects risk compared that.

To answer question would need transparency governments manufacturers, probably never that. vaccinations Sunday. J&amp;J executives, suspect deep cynical jaded heart. Office culture proven unnecessary unproductive. save hundreds dollars month commuting get sleep two extra hours per day, getting home 1.5 hours earlier. seeing coworkers forced chit chat extra perk, 
My company didn‚Äôt renew lease closed office save hundreds thousands rent next year Give bonuses. What‚Äôs even benefit high rise office city more? quite scary. pandemic prevented delayed huge number non-covid related medical screenings procedures. lead many unnecessary deaths caused covid itself, reaction it. call President it. Paris France ! Same! Mortality statistics average Europe I've seen. Romania country/culture good taking decisive action, long-term maintenance logistical procedures (our) weak points. (I'm American living here.)

What means emergent situations (the first lockdowns, vaccine rollouts), tend effective impressive, extended crises put stress weak points system - case, hospital system. We've several Covid patients die fires, example, hospital infrastructure electrical wiring faulty. We've old people left die sitting floor hospital hallways effective triage patient intake procedures, etc.

So basically Covid response great hospital medical system serious problems. interesting illustration, expect much easier get Covid vaccine get flu vaccine years I've lived here. asked family doctor flu vaccine years ago, laughed lol.

In terms elder care, seen statistics suspicion based experience Romania MUCH smaller population elders care homes begin with. would expect live either or, they're unable, family care them. Referring logistical systemic problems mentioned earlier, pretty much nobody would voluntarily put family members institutional setting unless hated another option. Even fancy private homes, would expect unpleasant difficult endure. shouldn‚Äôt worried all. vaccines still work SA variant, despite quite effective, still protect 100% cases requiring hospitalization. Hope get soon.

You‚Äôll get reign Queen Dick Seems like experts, politicians, media professionals still really give shit mental health though, based thier words actions. interested sure studies able help this. many people symptoms long term effects (loss smell/taste months, lung damage, lasting effects). truely prove end ""mild"" symptoms long term effects, different story. Also 85% individuals severe symptoms hospitalized, mean? lot unknowns vaccine hope comes next weeks. Ugh, pisses off. (rightfully) set aside time vaccine supply frontline healthcare workers decide say, ""Eh, thanks"" Yeah it‚Äôs fine... good news all. rambling hate media without actually pointing issues information presented. also consider moderate COVID-19 pneumonia deep vein thrombosis! That‚Äôs version freaking moderate. someone pneumonia before, it‚Äôs bad enough scar lungs! people call selfish, fine. It‚Äôs selfish want best yourself! plus side we‚Äôll scaled production, infrastructure place distribution quickly modify vaccine new variant. certainly like many years. Putin nothing wronk! Could similar people react lyme disease years others fine years after?  you‚Äôre talking general public, assumed uneducated topic. speaking group people continual education topics. saying fine general public, you‚Äôre talking allowing group people could potentially kill patients due non-compliance, would disagree. don‚Äôt want vaccine, reassigned another position isn‚Äôt facing general public.  arguing would rather jobs. Remote education education. laid myriad issues remote education even start core problem kids learning. 

Any teachers union taking position involve finding way get teachers back classrooms keeping wrong. CTU's position one extreme versions around trying keep teachers classrooms. Since South African strain found Maryland, probably country. worried 4th wave It‚Äôs decent fs mean kind portrayed guaranteed/certain thing bullshit agree vaccine better none, according CNN, studies showing that's 85% effective overall preventing deaths &amp; hospitalizations, [not Africa long history stopping diseases. stop HIV, Coronavirus problem.  No, pissing people lead compliance rather opposite. Nothing you‚Äôre saying means burned every available reservoir.

The death count supports increased 2nd wave like literally every western country, India, Brazil etc. book called **if** it... Dude reinfection rare even new strain it‚Äôs debatable  Thank Johnson Johnson. Great work. we're going locked 2021 even multiple near-miracle vaccines developed record time, I'm curious plan near-miracles happened.

Was plan lock us ... years? Neighbor north, lot WA. case rate 40% nationally.  Quite areas, like county, almost cases November, still many.

I find article kind silly misleading general sense, though. People who've get varying degrees resistance it, fade time. newer strains may able evade resistance. Vaccination give better longer lasting results, long way go.  Fingers crossed new mutations limit vaccine effectiveness; we‚Äôre placing huge selection pressure evolutionarily capable organism already diverging rapidly looking recent phylogenetic models. Denmark cull little fuckers. Problem solved. Weather Channel accused past pro weather bias. hope everyone understands even vaccinate get covid asymptomatic. vaccine hopefully lower number people get sick enough end hospitals overwhelm system manage sick. think outbreaks already squashed without shut downs. Cases hospitalizations dropping like crazy US. Yep! sick hearing Dr. Fauci TV doctors already got pfizer/moderna vaccines talking vaccine great news effective. Wonder would feel taking vaccine 57% effective African variant (which probably dominant hear soon). Variants mutations also seen ""UK variant"" also arisen spontaneously USA, elsewhere (in reports). worth noting (again) variability somewhat normal, big cases loads USA variants arising domestically well. refusing get J&amp;J vaccine spreading misinfo good enough bad worse happened kids getting covid-related syndrome? Don‚Äôt read much anymore.. Seems like brainer me. highest quality teacher performance morale- Zoom school teachers staff vaccinated, open schools. teachers feel safe happy, kids feel safe happy. Les that. transmissible variants replicating fast country. Besides, rules already pretty tough non citizens Can't drive personal car work. use public transportation car accidents cam overwhelm hospitals. think true sure. province stuck plateau 500 cases day 5-10 deaths day, might sound terrible compared places numbers, pretty high us. 

Right restrictions basically personal life lockdown. socializing anyone outside household, group meet ups outdoors, dining anyone outside household, masks mandated, several restrictions work places, places worship ordered close, wedding ceremonies may happen maximum 10 people reception afterwards. 

But yet we're still stuck plateau visible minority following restrictions people feel like ""well I?"" nothing, cases would skyrocketing way CA is. really difficult balance, destroying mental health getting covid wraps, destroying economy effectively keeping everyone safe home, nothing praying vaccine get enough people hit herd immunity. god forbid adults healthy coping skills confidence end soon  Daily cases falling 12th Dec - 12779 cases 4350 cases Today Netherlands.

If that's due vaccine, what?  media knew exactly choice headline, they‚Äôve since beginning, continue every single day receive strong enough pushback. Honestly I‚Äôm wondering same. haven‚Äôt lived Netherlands almost decade I‚Äôm date Dutch politics culture anymore honest. think Netherlands sometimes tendency compromise much &amp; take ages discuss things everyone happy whereas scenario would‚Äôve better govt acted decisively ordered vaccines (besides EU vaccines) plan B. Especially since Netherlands enough money &amp; good infrastructure vaccinate lot people quickly.  Yup, many scientists predicting long term behave like common cold due immunity. Though next years may like seasonal flu first.   countries? link something? couldn‚Äôt find anything quick googling Preprint articles require higher degree scrutiny rigor accurately evaluate many types articles. kind discussion would appropriate strictly scientific subreddit /r/COVID19.

Thank helping us keep information /r/Coronavirus reliable!


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Can‚Äôt go camping either. Data shows camping leads surges concern mutation render vaccine totally obsolete ineffective, worry. SARS-COV-2 mutates slightly slower viruses. uncommon viruses mutate fundamentally evade vaccines. Since SARS-COV-2 mutates even slower viruses, there's little need concern. That's question doctor, would assume free take another vaccine line, least sort booster. talked situation, reflection people know. response claim one cares.

The government reduce amount trams April. can't. transportation companies criticized FHM so.

You probably right say 80% wear masks, shopping food. however avoid going store often necessary. myself, late people shop keep distance shoppers. Flu vaccine tweaked every year doesn‚Äôt go trials.

One many big questions scientists trying untangle whether people get Covid-19 pregnancy pass natural immunity newborns.

[Recent hinted might. [new published Friday journal JAMA Pediatrics, provide another piece puzzle, offering evidence Covid-19 antibodies cross placenta.

‚ÄúWhat found fairly consistent learned studies viruses,‚Äù said Scott E. Hensley, associate professor microbiology Perelman School Medicine University Pennsylvania one senior authors study.

Additionally, added, study suggests women transferring antibodies fetuses, also transferring antibodies babies infected earlier pregnancies. might implications women vaccinated Covid-19, Dr. Hensley said, adding vaccinating women earlier pregnancy might offer protective benefits, ‚Äúbut studies actually analyzing vaccination among pregnant women need completed.‚Äù

In study, researchers Pennsylvania tested 1,500 women gave birth Pennsylvania Hospital Philadelphia April August last year. those, 83 women found Covid-19 antibodies ‚Äî gave birth, 72 babies tested positive Covid-19 antibodies via cord blood, regardless whether mothers symptoms.

According Dr. Karen Puopolo, associate professor pediatrics University Pennsylvania one senior authors study, half babies antibody levels high higher found mother‚Äôs blood, quarter cases, antibody levels cord blood 1.5 2 times higher mother‚Äôs concentrations.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs fairly efficient,‚Äù Dr. Puopolo said.

The researchers also observed longer time period start pregnant woman‚Äôs Covid-19 infection delivery, antibodies transferred, finding noted elsewhere.

The antibodies crossed placenta immunoglobulin G, IgG, antibodies, type made days getting infected thought offer long-term protection coronavirus.

None babies study found immunoglobulin M, IgM, antibodies, typically detected soon infection, suggesting babies hadn‚Äôt infected coronavirus.

Experts don‚Äôt yet know amount antibodies passed babies enough prevent newborns getting Covid-19. babies study born prematurely, researchers can‚Äôt say whether babies born early might miss protective antibodies. study authors also noted results one facility, findings would need replicated.

The placenta complex organ, one understudied, said Dr. Denise Jamieson, obstetrician Emory University Atlanta member Covid expert group American College Obstetricians Gynecologists, involved study.

And research needed better understand whether vaccine-generated antibodies behave comparably antibodies Covid-19 infection, said Dr. Andrea G. Edlow, assistant professor obstetrics, gynecology reproductive biology Harvard Medical School.

In [a published journal Cell December, instance, Dr. Edlow colleagues found Covid-19 antibodies natural infection might cross placenta less efficiently antibodies produced vaccination flu whooping cough (pertussis).

‚ÄúWhat really want know is, antibodies vaccine efficiently cross placenta protect baby, way know happens influenza pertussis,‚Äù Dr. Jamieson said.

Experts know whether Covid vaccine work way, part [pregnant women initial clinical trials.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs plausible Covid vaccine offer protection pregnant mothers infants,‚Äù said Dr. Mark Turrentine, member Covid expert group A.C.O.G. ‚ÄúTo me,‚Äù added, ‚Äúthis study highlights inclusion pregnant women clinical trials Covid-19 vaccine essential, particularly benefit vaccination greater potential risk life-threatening disease.‚Äù can‚Äôt would stop spread Great  Hmm.. however quarantined arriving new state. possible. one literally recommendation rather order (a lot campus facilities closed citing it, off-campus situation doesn‚Äôt change). Fine tell others postpone lives indefinitely. I'd accept J&amp;J vaccine, protection better protection. I'd stay almost entirely isolated, 11 months, fear death, adding chronic impairments ones already have. clear severity acute disease relationship chronic long-term effects.

With Moderna Pfizer vaccines, I'd consider seeing people wear masks, forming bubbles.

I think me, need one step caution conventional wisdom, health issues. I‚Äôd think reason measurement. It‚Äôs reliable metric say someone did/did end hospital. ways categorizing severity could run risk subjective. I‚Äôm engineer, medical field, guesswork part. think he'll explicitly come say ""hey guys we're herd immunity, pandemic over,"" he'll gradually reduce level caution he's advising us take throughout spring summer. 1% 66% effective compared Pfizer‚Äôs 95%?

Pregnant women looking guidance Covid-19 vaccines facing kind confusion dogged pandemic start: world‚Äôs leading public health organizations ‚Äî U.S. Centers Disease Control Prevention, World Health Organization ‚Äî offering contradictory advice.

Neither organization explicitly forbids encourages immunizing pregnant women. weighing limited studies, provide different recommendations.

The C.D.C.‚Äôs advisory committee urged pregnant women consult doctors rolling sleeves ‚Äî decision applauded several women‚Äôs health organizations kept decision making hands expectant mothers.

The W.H.O. recommended pregnant women receive vaccine, unless high risk Covid work exposures chronic conditions. issued guidance Moderna vaccine Tuesday, stirring uncertainty among women doctors social media. (Earlier month, published similar guidance Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.)

Several experts expressed dismay W.H.O.‚Äôs stance, saying risks pregnant women Covid far greater theoretical harm vaccines.

‚ÄúThere documented risks fetus, there‚Äôs theoretical risks, there‚Äôs risk animal studies,‚Äù vaccines, said Dr. Anne Lyerly, bioethicist University North Carolina, Chapel Hill. ‚ÄúThe think it, disappointed sad feel it.‚Äù

The difference opinion C.D.C. W.H.O. rooted scientific evidence, lack it: Pregnant women barred participating clinical trials vaccines, decision line long tradition excluding pregnant women biomedical research, one challenged. covid19 bad, shudder think nations/people, wouldl treat pandemic deadlier. awful, disgusting viewpoint. elderly much human contact year, others die can't avoid contact. even opening vaccinations over-75s February, young researchers miniscule risk dying COVID get vaccines likely could've saved others. Says Privileged yuppie work home. don‚Äôt really stop spread flu cold. Flu cold particles smaller COVID particles easily pass masks. Unnecessarily rude. Run people ass irl? Wrong. Tests mandatory quarantining self-imposed. counties 10-15% infections. Based serological testing, CDC estimated early December almost 30% Americans Covid. increased least 35+% last two months. 

The CDC states Jan 15th 2021 1 4.6 Covid cases detected (95% Confidence Interval 4.0 - 5.4). Take county‚Äôs confirmed cases, multiply 4.6, divide population. Let know get. 

Then add %vaccinated estimate. try that, noncompliant. won‚Äôt seeing it‚Äôll cause mass noncompliance. Except USA nobody get choose.

[Study finds Brazil‚Äôs Jair Bolsonaro carried ‚Äòinstitutional strategy spread  know countries world beside USA?  tend agree that. know healthy man 40s well right know whole slew 80+ problem it. summer Uk back Aigand look cases rising steadily since August really started rise significantly September still summer UK. new variant came around. Plus UK like one worst death tolls world rigjt covid. Can't blame new variant winter. Exact opposite.

By giving virus many hosts allowing mutate freely. India country race. criticize India make racist! supposed reply naming another island nation though proper rebuttal, what?

Taiwan another example guy telling you: sealing borders works great, widespread community transmission. worked Taiwan early and, again, many points entry. worked NZ remoteness meant even though much later act, cases still low could easily control ingress country. Neither case particularly relevant applicable countries interconnected already widespread transmission virus. Luckily, we've invented immortality nobody ever die again! agree that. knows right strategy really is. allowing people catch suffer seems pretty cruel. know several people caught said absolutely brutal. Additionally, one really knows long term effects virus. 

But remember, US also developed vaccine H1N1 2009. also messed vaccine rollout H1N1 fizzled away. swine flu wasn‚Äôt deadly still infected 60 million people one year. 

And look Wuhan New Zealand. pretty much beaten virus without vaccine. still diligent international travel testing quarantine visitors. 

I honestly think better testing year ago things would much better situation. J&amp;J said approved immediately ship 2M doses. They‚Äôre planning 100M 2021 US don‚Äôt know they‚Äôve said expect/how many definition ""severe disease"" press study, definition severe COVID-19 disease included laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 one following: signs consistent severe systemic illness, admission intensive care unit, respiratory failure, shock, organ failure death, among factors. 

Apparently people symptoms go hospital.  Sorry, you‚Äôre right ship 17 tons. skimmed quickly. Death happened 2020. know shocking information. Johnson Johnson said 100M doses US April ends. can't realistically lock whole world virus goes away. That‚Äôs fabulous, thank EU politicians would like everyone believe rational technocrats, reality things according exactly political logic every politician. Even basic understanding EU Commission show political intrigue goes there. initial strain. Hopefully vaccine induce stronger response natural infection. 

There significantly reduced vaccine effectiveness South African variant similar mutations Brazil though. Multiple trials studies finding that.  Yes, anything sucks comparison, including jj. We're agreement

In world ""people dying protect loved ones"" jjs major point stops death, serious issues cases.

Who wants vs moderna wouldn‚Äôt like it? mean, possible. time, find exceedingly unlikely kid trial completes availability general public. UK? France? Italy? US?

No flu season required military deploy American hospitals take care patients. first adenovirus vaccine ever approved approved one year ago - Europe Ebola.

The first adenovirus **vaccine**. *vaccine* keyword.

Adenovirus **vectors** use humans decade, deliver genes subjects, injectable mRNA boxed lipid nanoparticles thing Would lesser viral load potentially mean less opportunities mutations take hold? 

(Not trying sealion questions, genuinely don‚Äôt know enough stuff works.)  everybody knows ‚ÄúA‚Äù student much better ‚ÄúC‚Äù student.

Yep. analogy valid though we're comparing two college degree holders. Simply degree far important grades. There‚Äôs virus vector non-human animal proteins raise secondary immune response. honesty - seems like vaccine would least likely cause long term harm.

Indeed I'm bit troubled short term harm long term one. Scientifically speaking, hard prove long term safety literally wait 2-10 years claim one, apart theoretical reasoning, clear could ever happen issue, along history vaccines.

Short-term? Beyond allergy reactions, body reacts vaccination different way do? I'm much scared vaccine immune system. Immune system ""crazy"" potentially turn nuclear reasons. That's actual spike. trough secondary peak level holidays. see two catch days (the two large spikes corresponding Christmas New Years catch days). rest days higher trough second surge. Exactly.

Wait would everyone Canada need 6 doses?! mean give everyone 2 doses millions unneeded vaccine doses could go people need able get one June July US countries. CDC tracker much lower? couple things:

1. Cases Israel slightly time high, lots infections overall.
2. got second shot recently. 9.5% total Israeli population second dose week ago 17.6% now. almost half got second dose less week (so full protection).
3. compound point 2, lag infection symptoms, symptoms hospitalization. Due short time people second dose, almost hospitalized getting second shot probably infected even getting it. 
4. Israel vaccinated elderly 1st, vast majority people 2cond dose elderly. 73% 90+, 71% 80-90, 78% 70-80 60% 60-70. containing 7% 20-30, 10% 30-40. But, essentially changed course polio. got rid it.

Er, no, didn't. still endemic Afghanistan Pakistan, CIA ran fake vaccination clinic attempt locate Osama bin Laden. consequence, attacks deaths among vaccination workers.

Not. Bingo.  Go take nap eat snack, seem hungry tired. Chew Twix shit That's good answer, tbh. Agreed. losening restrictions rigjt worst thing doing. Open door invite new variants dinner. Right, 34% chance contracting covid, 15% chance serious disease. Even hospitalized, might still long haul symptoms. mean could choose Moderna, Pfizer J&amp;J, I'd get mRNA vaccines since much better protection. depends many show up. benefit free exchange idea obvious fields like academia, science, philosophy, i.e. controlled environments rational people. negative also obvious. Information spread publicly real, widespread consequences society taken lightly. Misinformation, conspiracy theories, disinformation evolve huge costs individuals societies alike. one could course hope ‚Äúbad‚Äù information get debunked ‚Äúgood‚Äù ones, remember cost way effort resources combat fake news coming them, many times damage already done way truth surfaces. me, answer definitely clear cut think healthy compromise way go. 

It‚Äôs also incredibly alarming people somehow think information controlled China. Take U.S example, twitter FB accounts get banned time ‚Äúspreading misinformation‚Äù. Trump, literally represents voices almost half Americans, effectively shut modern communication platforms. Anyone blind would realize censorship alive well U.S mainstream media. Oh mention whistleblowers like Snowden, Assange, Chelsea Manning, etc gets persecuted revealing mass surveillance war crimes. I'd ask straightforward question, think open, democratic closed autocratic governments political systems tend produce better results (or likely achieve better society)

**Internally:** 

The standard living China risen incredible pace past 20-30 years. Infrastructure well-built, economy 2nd largest world, government pulled 600 million people extreme poverty. Chinese people wealthier healthier they've ever been. Higher education medicare affordable cost. Government continue spend huge amount resources poverty elimination improving lives least fortunate average people. There's hatred different ethnicities country, country united ever continues steadily develop. 

The standard living U.S really changed much meantime average person. Infrastructure shit higher education medicare affordable top 10% society. areas continue underfunded U.S continue spend next 10 countries combined defense, funneling money military-industrial complex, insurance companies, wall street, etc. middle class shrinking, wealth gap wider ever, poverty rate homelessness problematic ever corporations revenue stock market hits time highs. Racial tensions high there's deep rooted division within nation.

&amp;#x200B;

**Externally:**

China: wars borders/sovereignty risk violated. killing, invasion, interference country's internal affairs. 

U.S: continue invade countries, commit war crimes, manufacture dissent order topple (democratically elected) government overt covert operations. Civilian casualties displacements millions. protect hegemony profits ruling class corporate elites. 

&amp;#x200B;

I see China's system performing worse. you? exactly West focus narrative ""(market)freedom, (sham)democracy, (individual)rights"", produce atrocity propagandas. ruling elites simply cannot afford let people know much they're failing them. 

To answer question, care ideologies. simply look results. CCP, despites shortcomings, served core interest Chinese people incredibly well: sovereignty, stability, peacefulness, prosperity, order. ""open democratic"" governments West stop serving interest elites stop imperialistic foreign policies abuses global south, I'm open changing mind. GOT BOT. looked modern rabies vaccine apparently don‚Äôt stomach shots anymore. 

I could‚Äôve easily misunderstood that‚Äôs bonkers progress Amazing, thanks! Goods go back forth everyday. closure tourists like. thing could done seal borders stop allowing incoming international flights. Since value dollars lives never happen. hundreds thousands people died needlessly. use Sinopharm vaccine China. Hungary also ordered 5 million doses. Wake people! still playing fire though eventually virus evolve vaccine resistant strains begin become larger system threat. left ok absolute numbers. without questions clear. Five years ago people would agreed lockdowns stupid idea something like would move lives.

I can't imagine would happen Ebola scare nowadays. Post christmas everyone 'broke' go less. shop eat visit. movement symptom horrible Public Health messaging, root cause like CNN would like suggest , IMO. public health advice masks goes ""please don't, work"" ""Wear else"" months, tell public goal every measure is, also provide end date putting public through, start ignore you.

And guess what? lot COVID regulations science based, result political figures throwing darts wall. respect scientists write incredible papers using complex math scientific method. respect singular people claim decider public able do, science process hivemind. anything anti consensus, designed challenge itself. That's exactly UK strategy is. Yes, know still spreads. presumably less viral load less (which symptoms milder). It‚Äôs probable insignificant number young people recovered going really bad lifelong health problems idea. media obsesses case fatality rate research last summer showing 4 5 recovered serious possibly fatal heart damage bode well.

Thank God greet pandemic twenties stupid understand risk.

The risk catching covid right anybody really bad yet know recovered fair years later research shows fair amount downside.

I think possible pandemic could much worse society wants believe. paper actually reworked.

IIRC one profs highlighted data cannot factually acurate, i.e. values seemed highly improbable, hinting may made entirely.

They've revised values, seem out-of-the-ordinary anymore, apparently mildly-elevated, expected person viral infection addition sitting around home day (hence saying paper brilliant looking consequences thereof). mention athletes tend slightly enlarged hearts constant cardio.

IFR ~.5%

If everyone COVID-19, 50k would die.

As right now, 16k died, around 33% 50k.

So ~33% infected far. you‚Äôre US, it‚Äôs 72%. reason average lower SA variant. 

Overall prevented death vaccine participants. source directly investigating main author explains results layman's terms here: asymptomatic patients transmit virus others, emerging evidence suggests asymptomatic index cases transmit fewer secondary cases. Attack rates highly correlated symptom severity

Out curiosity, know people know spreading covid asymptomatically? Neither source ever said possible, less personally know multiple people spreading fully asymptomatic. advantage it‚Äôs traditional vaccine. People worried mRNA stuff likely get one. would much rather someone get 66% vaccine get one all. clear, witness. Since didn‚Äôt testify (bc judge would allow mask), evidence.

I‚Äôm concerned distribution method, I‚Äôm concerned coming J&amp;J. read article day said final trials showed vaccine ~66% effective opposed Pfizer Moderna‚Äôs ~95% effective rate. Would much rather get vaccine unless facts twisted. Minority students bearing brunt classrooms, session 

Are they? think *all* children bearing brunt right now. Take example five year old, started kindergarten Zoom year. would minority *any* impact outcome? They're going least somewhat socially stunted this, nothing race.

The REAL problem concerning students Chicago fact lot them, meal school consistent meal day. days might lunch, days might dinner, still others school lunch might meal entire day. take away that... concerning. food security net torn shreds. 

The problem students likely recruited (or pressed) gangs, since longer school occupy time. 

You also consider fact coronavirus disproportionately affects minorities, almost certainly part increased likelihood lower income.  J&amp;J approved distributed, vaccines administered need one shot J&amp;J also don‚Äôt forget lot people cannot take, don‚Äôt want vaccine 2 million per day, take like 200 days 300 days vaccinate everyone want one. I‚Äôm holding breath 2022 Speaking US here: post author commenting on, IMO think see business restrictions start ease spring, conversation loosening mask rules beginning sometime early summer. sure this. think people going want cautious period businesses open masks full normal. 

Some people going need controlled return normal. scientists proposing zero-COVID strategy Europe USA. quite fringe scientific community. 72% effective, it‚Äôs better flu shots line vaccines. It‚Äôs really good. Pay attention actual scanned hearts lungs people tested positive COVID-19, never felt ill, seen telltale signs lungs, scientists reported cloudy white areas called ‚Äúground glass opacities‚Äù asymptomatic patients. Ground glass opacities also seen patients severe four different studies people asymptomatic infections, half ground glass opacities CT Time issue. take variant 2 months become widespread, 4 months get vaccine distributed (actually peoples' arms), problem. think it‚Äôs good lot options, vast majority population, people limited options reason. example, I‚Äôm immunocompromised deathly allergic medications, meaning Pfizer think others wouldn‚Äôt best someone like me. Italy hard lockdown 2 months. even get remotely close zero. US isn‚Äôt even 2 million day administered. 2 million vaccines per day would still take 300 days vaccinate everyone. @Kovidiot1 (very appropriate username)

My guess one done. Delhi lot PR cases sky rocketed HM come couple times.In 3rd wave SC &amp; HC slammed Delhi take action. necessarily true limited evidence moderna trial, well coming Israel regarding Pfizer, pointing opposite: vaccines (at least mRNA vaccines) least significantly reduce infection/transmission rates. Yeh, headline doesn‚Äôt actually match article. Right bottom article reach conclusion one. What's this? article talks common sense pessimistic? I... I... even see good news there?

It's first! /s course lol true. avoid place months. past two months decided come back, become much balanced, sensible less hyperbolic. work China,Vietnam,Thailand? Getting R&lt;1 without vaccines de facto means zero covid Really mind boggling bad OWS messed therapeutic end things. Yes, depending consider severe symptoms. around 20% Covid cases severe. &amp; yet pfizer stock goes down.. Agreed mistake then. CVS's region must pfizer Isolating?

Have seen numbers?

People whatever want.

There‚Äôs selective pressure.

It‚Äôs ok clue you‚Äôre talking about, could try reading improving yourself.

The virus isn‚Äôt going mutate doesn‚Äôt hosts mutate in.

This isn‚Äôt hard.

The virus doesn‚Äôt know it‚Äôs spreading, doesn‚Äôt evolve one host desperate attempt evade lockdowns.

It came us west already pretty intense, mutated Italy, it‚Äôs mutated SA, UK, Brazil.

It didn‚Äôt mutate AUS, HK, Vietnam, Singapore, NZ. Would nice see sooner still welcome. 

Are pharmaceutical companies similar? Merck gave vaccine candidate, maybe shift potential capacity manufacturing licensed ones.

I realize retooling simple. Yeah, that's pretty much feel too. mayor idiot - complete utter lack empathy everyone herself... immediate campaign team course haha. Chicago all. 

And consider dunce governor, JB Pritzker. failed (and continues fail) roll vaccines timely manner. We're 46th state terms percentage population gotten vaccine, Idaho, Alabama, Nevada performing worse us. two incompetents high level positions administration, see teachers' distrust unwillingness return. South Africa world‚Äôs strictest lockdown similar Chinas failed explain one buddy doubt want dude. 9 students mine caught covid either opted virtual quit altogether home schooled. 

2 district, think number 5 area. double EU canada combined. Let's go! Warp speed babyy  sounds great, however, Johnson &amp;Johnson's vaccine 66% effective? would even waste time bringing production? could understand 6 8 months ago options available currently two far superior vaccines right now. manufacturers helping manufacture superior drugs instead inferior drug? 

I know answer course profits American think insurance pay. course take J&amp;J vaccine option goal would eventually receive one vaccines offers 90% greater effectiveness. worry insurance cover 2nd dose already vaccinated even inferior version. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.

Better idea, let‚Äôs shut fur farms. Problem solved. punished getting sick, maybe needing healthcare, getting deep debt. Nah, smaller events still happen (hanging friends etc)

Big events cancel simply less costly cancel play maybe game large event starting plan it.  guess infection acquired herd immunity real ü§î. trump administration excellent job vaccine roll-out.

Also, Alabama residents pay federal taxes, therefore entitled fruits Operation Warp Speed, funded American taxpayers. Canadian citizens pay taxes American federal government.

Also also, critical mass American citizens vaccinated, foreign unvaccinated people become increasingly less threat. care individual safety rather safety herd, therefore it‚Äôs personal interest vaccinated soon possible rather making sure every high-risk person world vaccinated me. We've zero teachers catch COVID school school Florida we've hundreds children receive good education. ‚ÄúLost number teachers covid‚Äù

What‚Äôs number? many caught school vs. home places?

‚ÄúMost student get covid ultimately end quitting school cannot handle school routine due shortness breath, constant fatigue, bouts coughing.‚Äù

[X] Doubt interest - why? I'm British us getting back normal ASAP, what's moral argument ensuring vulnerable people worldwide protected first? ‚ÄúLost number teachers covid‚Äù

What‚Äôs number? many caught school vs. home places?

‚ÄúMost student get covid ultimately end quitting school cannot handle school routine due shortness breath, constant fatigue, bouts coughing.‚Äù

[X] Doubt 2021, find way describe town besides color majority live there? FWIW I'm pro opening schools close socioeconomic disparity gap. said I'm surprised saying food. Florida school aged children given complete meals since last March. Every week pick spots (mostly lower socioeconomic areas) kid picks 5 days food questions asked. pickup available kids zoom school person kids fed school free. still figured every area was. using CAREs act money. Children suffering need school. teachers won‚Äôt teach find another line work better suited them.

If grocery store clerks refuse job also find another job better suited them.

We can‚Äôt stay home. It‚Äôs possible. one arguing zero covid strategy good intentions I‚Äôve open school, wanted random testing school refused. keep saying doesn‚Äôt spread school 30% staff tested positive far, we‚Äôve never made even 3 straight weeks closing 2 weeks due lack staff everyone sick quarantined. 

Now they‚Äôre starting get again! I‚Äôm watching get covid twice even vaccinated teachers get covid. parents pulled kids called 9pm say school closed 2 weeks kid can‚Äôt leave property 2 weeks ‚Äò4 people kids classroom covid‚Äô sucks parents done. 

The cdc said schools safe closed bars gyms kept community rates low. Every kid positive far asymptomatic school except one see pediatric pulmonologist 2 months later can‚Äôt walk short distances without gasping air. 

If batch testing, gave teachers actual masks classroom air filters, didn‚Äôt allow mask breaks kids... I‚Äôd fine. none things. humidity 20%, kids aren‚Äôt made tested ever, given one single layer cotton mask doesn‚Äôt fit, filters change ventilation kids take masks every 20 minutes break social distance ‚Äúwhen feasible‚Äù. 

This back forth bring ‚Äúeverything need work home 3 weeks‚Äù every day, students remote, person, quarantined, sick obnoxious. don‚Äôt even teach spend day logging seating charts, attendance, mask breaks, symptom screeners, bathroom trips contact tracing later. Kids ask every time someone absent they‚Äôre dying covid want zoom see they‚Äôre okay. 

If want school open, fund make safe restrict community activities make sure virus rates low. I‚Äôve got 20ish students going funerals grandparents next week. right. make fair points. add Mayo Clinic suggests vaccination delayed little risk 90 days first infection cleared, amend recommendation line medical advice.  shitshow EU means Pfizer AZD doses entire Middle East delayed Q2. Borders meant open March pushed May. plenty demand April May outside US EU, who've effectively hoarding doses blocking exports. think ever moment humanity started vaccination millions infection everyday, it? First know yet effective kids. Trials ongoing. 

And multiple vaccines even one shown less effective, mean be. 

We wait see studies show they've completed. testing literally begun Pfizer, Moderna reporting enough participants 12+ testing stating trial results 2022, dont believe J&amp;J even started testing kids yet... they're ones reporting numbers low ADULTS (no numbers reported kids yet).

All aside, 66% effective rate (what J&amp;J reporting adults) still better 0%. Well, they‚Äôre working much much better federal government now, hiccups I‚Äôm sure much much less. annoys many people commenting saying definitely getting J&amp;J shot offered, usually deeply uninformed view percentage efficiency makes good vaccine.

It also bothers people think vaccine campaign removing personal health anxiety around COVID. not. ending public health crisis. Even crisis over, still non zero risk contracting COVID another respiratory infection could cause complications.

We right live world without massive public health crisis. However anyone saying right live world without health risks living delusion never never real. None us right world without risk sickness. never existed never will.

Please get vaccine, whenever can, whatever vaccine is. Delaying personal risk tolerance issues bad ignoring mask mandates. public health problem need solve important personal risk tolerance concerns. I‚Äôm mind, least right now, I‚Äôll take whatever becomes available first.  Hehe ""into people's arms"" Good. Remote communities (be Native Americans reservation rural farmers) need equal access vaccination. Hopefully states neglected pay attention issue.  lift them. unless country wants face financial ruin collapse entire industries economies. Joined got first shot Thursday. 2/3 chance getting vaccine. arm hurt something bad afterwards, decent headache, felt flush minor joint pain. Feel fairly positive got vaccine. 

Even placebo I‚Äôm glad contribute science make money. [3]

**Glitches ‚Äòto expected‚Äô**

The chief executive Astrazeneca said delays production expected making new vaccine ‚Äúnot like orange juice‚Äù (Tom Whipple writes).

A problem manufacturing plant Belgium held supplies European Union Oxford-Astrazeneca vaccine, leading indirectly diplomatic row Britain production going smoothly.

Pascal Soriot said ‚Äúteething issues‚Äù expected. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre talking biology manufacturing here,‚Äù said, explaining making bottling vaccines ‚Äúextremely complicated‚Äù.

Doses made 1,000-2,000 litre ‚Äúbioreactors‚Äù, using human cells churn copies benign virus, active ingredient vaccine. process hard standardise yield varies sites.

The Times understands part reason UK government officials unwilling publish schedule doses arrive uncertainties supply lines, likelihood whole batches could go wrong.

Mr Soriot said speed programme meant still aspects understood.

‚ÄúEverybody‚Äôs learning curve usually develop year. We‚Äôve months.‚Äù

Speaking press conference coincide European Medicines Agency (EMA) approving vaccine adults 18, Mr Soriot said confident. ‚ÄúWe believe fixed issues productivity sites improve rapidly next months,‚Äù said.

The EMA decision came Germany‚Äôs vaccine committee said would recommend Oxford vaccine over-65s due lack data. [2]

Infection rates over-80s fallen 36 per cent month. age groups seen similar falls, biggest drop twenty-somethings whose rates halved.

However, Public Health England access infection data linked vaccination records, researchers compare chance catching virus jab similar ages not. Initial findings study due next week.

Professor Harnden said: ‚ÄúThe data still early reflects approximately three four weeks programme it‚Äôs mainly based Pfizer vaccine.‚Äù

The data yet show effect hospital admissions deaths scientists optimistic given case rates over-60s one reliable predictors impending hospital admissions.

Ministers likely use results vindication strategy delaying second doses beyond three four-week window specified manufacturers. Chris Whitty, chief medical officer England, said likely save lives doubling number protected.

The delay raised concerns whether disruptions supply prevent people getting second doses within 12-week window.

Professor Harnden said: ‚ÄúOur position receive second dose vaccine first dose, unless exceptional circumstances exceptional circumstances may supply constraints. case it‚Äôs better second dose different vaccine second dose all,‚Äù said.

‚ÄúThere aren‚Äôt results studies mixing vaccines moment, haven‚Äôt got evidence there‚Äôs theoretical evidence shouldn‚Äôt mix vaccines.‚Äù

The JCVI also due set guidance second stage vaccines programme within weeks, amid pressure teachers key workers given priority younger adults. list includes everyone 50 younger people chronic conditions. Given younger people much lower risk, ministers keen prioritise frontline workers.

Professor Harnden said untangling effects vaccination transmission complicated ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think we‚Äôre going know lot definitive transmission questions phase two vaccination programme going decided‚Äù.

With ministers keen understand use vaccines reopen economy, said: ‚ÄúThere going lot bodies feeding phase two addition JCVI. accept bits advice come groups expertise economic aspects social aspects . . . don‚Äôt think JCVI say example, ‚ÄòWe immunise teachers‚Äô.‚Äù viable major international hubs. [1]

Vaccination already easing Britain‚Äôs Covid epidemic early data showing definitely reducing cases.

Research due published within days provide real-world evidence Britons protected, including suggestions effect still building month one dose, said Anthony Harnden, deputy chairman Joint Committee Vaccination Immunisation (JCVI).

With fears EU export ban vaccines, Professor Harnden said plans place people able mix match vaccines second doses Pfizer jab unavailable.

Decisions vaccinating teachers key workers second phase likely involve political economic input clear evidence vaccines block transmission virus unlikely available months, said.

Yesterday official figures showed another 414,419 people given first dose, taking total 7.9 million, suggesting NHS halfway towards target immunising four vulnerable groups middle next month.

Protection thought take least two weeks build Professor Harnden said clear mass vaccination working bring cases.

‚ÄúThe preliminary data indicate vaccine effect first dose younger adults older adults 80. effect seems increase time,‚Äù said. ‚ÄúIt possible may get stronger better long-term protection delayed second dose.‚Äù

Also AZ making profit vaccine believe Pfizer is.... could well end every year. thought I'd mention optimistic possibility five, came reliable source. Yes, should. Also get lucky get moderna better protected new variants. 90% extremely good vaccine, 66% pretty decent initially expected.

No, not. That's ""the flu vaccine"" makes believe, ""the flu vaccine"" *four* different vaccines four different flu virusses 50% effective *because know another virus 4 around*. No, opinion reading tons testimony long COVID sufferers.

From people I've read 'long-COVID', majority go doctor cannot find specific medical cause symptoms. They're coming back clean lung xrays, clean heart scans etc blaming doctors taking seriously. 

These observations. Perhaps I've missed lot people actually diagnosed long-COVID medical professional. 

It may wild claim, certainly less wild claiming mysterious illness identical symptoms anxiety ravaging perfectly healthy young people way get diagnosed virologists? *know*, obviously, educated informal guess professional scientists better could venture. mRNA based vaccines (and technology) stay various reasons that's makes sense production capacity longterm

The stupidity local bus company also got covid refused go home still came work knowing covid Last year everyone betting vaccine still argue good move. None us knew vaccines would work come first made sense variety vaccines work incase failed. guess every vaccine plant ability manufacture pfizer vaccines. world fair. fine ""destroy"" lives millions people built lives depend international travel order stop pandemic.

I put ""destroy"" quotes lives destroyed. can't see 2 years sucks you, societal level that's small problem compared pandemic. Well fill questionnaire allergic reaction histories waiting Yep. increase landmass 3000% get rid 40 million people would laughing. Fucking Boris, missing obvious solution. Yep, younger children something rest us, older children - freshly primed immune systems recently developed fuck ton antibodies many different coronaviruses. They're years old, antibodies robust years comes coronaviruses. natural antibodies coronaviruses perform well SARS-CoV-2? No, zero specificity, immunological aspects primed working overtime, moment too. Adults specified antibodies good job specific tasks.

Let essential travel happen, limit personal/vacation travel. lot people trying start work Japan borders shut due irresponsible personal travel. Data? I'm reading 10% long term effects controlled people flu timeframe. sample average age increses risk risk high everyone. work dumbass.

They aren‚Äôt effective mRNA vaccine, effective rolled infections high great effect.

You beyond clueless comes this.

Why get Reddit read micro bio textbook. There‚Äôs even coloring book version that‚Äôs speed. That's valid, data infected covid affect kids. valid point, people able opt treated given informed consent vaccinated. That‚Äôs accurate least figure. 
Also, individual household pays government public school funding either.  case original idea chase away Internet tardigrades - bots, spam accounts, quick-fingered low information level trolls. Maybe works, every articulated in-honest account unpopular opinion gets slapped 15 minute trip corner kindergarten room ""cool off"", 10K spammers get eliminated way.

I know. know point social media development, algo sophisticated oneliner ""if(x&lt;a) { wait; }else { commentaway_mlady; }"" would probably prefer Pfizer vaccine, case, user name would really check out, like hedge fund manager greasy Motel 6 Timbuktu.

Nurses doctors double masking whole time. person right thought theory much practice. test antibodies see got vaccine won‚Äôt 100% sensitive reasons mentioned below.

Don't see family 2 years pandemic over. Problem solved (not jobs ... different countries

If company operating internationally big enough support remote work, probably lot virtual collaboration even COVID. Unless extremely compelling reason physically need on-site task, travel. Oh. Sorry, don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs restrictions giving blood. know you‚Äôre supposed make babies. [Vaccine version Probably is. doubt there's significant amount people around. behaves like almost every virus likelihood wont transmitting vaccination unless get sick. novel virus, yet data back rather assuming everythings safe asking us keep wearing masks social distance known.

That's understanding anyway. It‚Äôs probably both, great True that, booster percentage go up. main draw severity prevention getting people vaccinated would stop spread organically. Even getting downvoted true. People almost religiously believe virus affects old resolves completely everyone else.  there‚Äôs still horse hospital?!? guess mean basically point another everyone world severe symptoms? high risk people maybe *do* still get severe symptoms? long-term symptoms know prevented vaccine? I'm genuinely asking things anyone knows, feel like I'm educated enough vaccine probably be.  clueless one.

The virus mutates replicates.

You seem think it‚Äôs trying get around vaccine, it‚Äôs not.

It randomly mutating, time, hosts get sick, mutate.

The three mutations same, stupid you?  Historically non mandatory vaccination campaigns mixed strong educational push benefits vaccination resulted higher compliance IE: vaccination. It‚Äôs mandatory LTC Ontario either, highly encouraged. 300M loan. 

Meanwhile, US government gave 4.1 billion Moderna alone... well advance could ramp production.

This lead time important since first time anything like ever tried. 

The EU really said ‚Äúthank you‚Äù Germany friends first secured vaccines entire EU. takes 11 months go testing trials again? Maybe read actual research instead basing opinion random subreddits commenters?

Here: [ Six month Neurological Psychiatric Outcomes 236,379 Survivors COVID-19 different SARS. There's simply good reason believe long covid joke even rare. Lol would expect resurgence, think could contributed speed drop saw one comment dsy said first got J&amp;J results we'd cheering joy brilliant news groundbreaking achievement. pfizer/moderna unfortunately spoiled people expect 90%+ efficiency every vaccine. fact consider second rate vaccine. annual flu shot happily take 40-60% efficient yet complain that. J&amp;J effective annual flu shot that's already win. mention also said 66% overall efficient 85% efficient severe symptoms hospitlisations. think important bit yes even develop symptoms likely minor symptoms vaccine likely still keep hospital dying. End day mind much developing minor symptoms flu like definitely want go hospital. that's main aim keeping us hospital. far I'm concerned vaccine win book. 

And logistically thus vaccine plus single dose. worries calling people second shot worrying we'll second shot time. Simply infect send way done dusted. 

I want vaccinated asap take whatever vaccine I'm offered aslong safe effective. mean vaccines past say flu vaccine whatever go ask effective vaccine you? course take whatever doctor recommends. offer J&amp;J first I'll take it. 

One year ago zero vaccines we're left dark pandemic end. several safe effective vaccines. think alone huge achievement. Nobody seems asking why, cases dropped fast.

Plenty people asked offered explanations. Maybe need read more?

We're coming holiday spike. Friends family got together indoors Thanksgiving New Years. holidays over, people went back work, back homes, probably spent time core household vs. outsiders. Naturally would expect decline coming peak (by definition).

Layer onto vaccine that, still small % vaccinated, (mostly) prioritized need most.

But guess easier blame sort media conspiracy. would shocked businesses schools mandate soon feasibly available. Even least scrupulous business owners would probably prefer workers risk infecting work sick. Many opted would covid already. I'm seeing healthcare worker. actually can't name single one colleagues refusing vaccine. booster shot may prove bring efficacy near mRNA levels, keep mind single shot effectiveness around 50-60% too. in... people sit desks, sit desks... contact peers bad children. way around it. fact I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs bad humans general. give young people eager move on. older person someone underlying health conditions may opt better vaccine, let already get vaccine help curb spread. also consider efficacy different age different age groups. look young healthy individuals, closer 80% overall rate 66%. personally would opt receive J&amp;J vaccine tomorrow could instead waiting June Pfizer Moderna vaccine. make sense contagious burned people can't refuse take precautions? get spanked like naughty little boy boat. Listen experts...

Article yesterday: 

‚ÄúDouble masking COVID-19: Fauci recommends wearing two masks 

Dr. Fauci's recommendation comes light new strains SARS-CoV-2, coronavirus causes COVID-19, thought transmissible primary strain SARS-CoV-2. 

""With transmissible virus, means every exposure increased likelihood leading spread,"" says Andrea Love, immunologist microbiologist. ""We must stringent behaviors now, including social distancing, minimizing trips public places, avoiding indoor spaces always wearing mask.

If plan near people household, however, even outdoors, ""a simple solution double-mask."" really wish world came together first vaccinated healthcare workers world... could really learn whole lot listening pressers Coronavirus task force explained things going dip due going low hanging fruit staff target captive retail.

It‚Äôs rolling DoD federal vaccine sites 16 hour vaccine windows. Im new Reddit seems shitting US sport here. like Movie Mean Girls, bashed popular girl secretly wanted her. understanding 66% chance u fight covid entirely, remaining 37%, 85%+ reduced severe symptoms 0 hospitalizations? Yupp, good news came last year. Although worry vaccination campaigns put pause 2020.

But measles would another one still prevalent killing covid. Unfortunately already getting worse pausing vaccinations also clear cut. Many vulnerable (particularly considering age statement) take risks put harms way themselves, without need us blame actions young. Call county health department. Explain situation, may shot you. hope elderly/at risk people opportunity get vaccine. Good. Give vaccines less work do. summer without annoying day day restrictions question. Still. long enough second dose acquire immunity. Unfortunately happens nearly everything sides political spectrum: terrorism, gun shootings, car crashes, airplane accidents, on. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Hahaha read first! Minnesota  Well 2 Oreos better 1 i'd imagine use logic vaccines right? last one made smile.... embraced dark side again..... evil is.

the joke always satan god fought... god sent hell... satan running things since then... ; liked needed robots zombies.... understand efficacy calculated. 66% effective mean 34% people got shot got Covid. means 66% fewer people got Covid people got placebo. example, say 1000 people got placebo 1000 people got vaccine. placebo group, 100 people got Covid. 66% effectiveness means 66% fewer people got actual shot 34 people Covid. effectiveness calculated sick placebo vs sick vaccine, sick vaccine percentage people received vaccine. Thank üòä I‚Äôve many times visiting him, know way around pretty good.  friend didn‚Äôt get vaccine, yet anyway. She‚Äôs low risk complications (25) she‚Äôs working bloody hard she‚Äôs RT. 

She‚Äôd educated pro-vaccination; reticence there‚Äôs information might impact ability kids.  many companies trying push vaccine candidates. It'd really nice Western governments order vaccine manufacturing facilities operating within borders producing vaccines instead stand idly waiting approval own. 

This needs global team effort produce vaccines 24/7 get even escape variants. everybody took virus seriously people still party much society continuing like doesn‚Äôt exist lol 
Reddit Reddit think represent general public shocked society something else üòÇ believe 100% hospitalizations want hear. Info straight horse's mouth! Hopefully darkest days over. people say *If safe work, can't personal time.* 

My office tons people could work home work. ridiculous. Everyone reaching end ropes. 100k dead UK assuming IFR 0.4% approximately 25 million people infection already.

Lol, ok. misleading Think it‚Äôs safe enough get masked haircut next week cases back late-October levels (at least city)? Don‚Äôt know might coming March April variants don‚Äôt want go summer without cut. everything closed can't really interact anyone, whereas pre lockdown age group likely socialising Cuz dont want u take Unlikely. Navajo Indian Reservation Arizona 0.5% deaths population it‚Äôs still spreading. believe UK 0.15. There‚Äôs still plenty room fir new infections deaths. say this...I know I'm minority. know I'm weird. I'm trying minimize psychological toll people experiencing. 

But actually mind feel like mental health gotten better. feel like place admit anonymous-ish place like Reddit. I'm introverted imaginable hate social situations. going movies, eat wife, going vacation...I kind like it. I'm saving much money I've somehow managed max 401k Roth IRA.

I'm aware might among like 0.001% humans feel way. feel like anxiety decreased since last March. Markedly so. go parties, stupid weddings, birthdays, things like weight shoulders. pretty nice.

I'm definately looking forwards weddings starting again. Ugh. I'm actually starting sense feeling dread knowing I'll like two years backlogged weddings sit through.  downvoting ""scary"" news, downvoting poorly thought out, sensationalist stuff adds nothing value discourse. Many dwelled sub last year seen near gleeful smashing upvote button every gloomy article posted, watching early vaccine research met tepid reaction shrugged shoulders.

Many us watch numbers see science tired melodrama winning reality. That's we're pushing back. Cases freefall, hospitalizations down, deaths down, we're getting vaccine vaccine locked loaded deployed, there's good reason done Eternal Pandemic nonsense. 

We're also sick media shying away new reality. Even ""straight laced"" outfits like PBS immune sweeping positivity rug. Every night used somberly report every record broke daily cases/deaths, numbers right track, suddenly hear overall total cases/deaths daily numbers 7 day averages. Vaccines beating 100 million 100 days goal? Nope, gonna mention that, here's story state people grumpy going even faster.

We've year hell, thanks incredible work researchers around world future back. yeah, I'm going something called hope optimism damn good reason feel otherwise. way want Johnson &amp; Johnson's vaccine. jump last minute shitty version that's half potent others, company horrible reputation business integrity mission accomplished mr Bush think difference eating meat, killing animals want fancy coat. BTW hope right. can't see it. also note, lived there, interacting people outside household becomes pretty onerous achieve North Dakota December bothers continue see articles admitting there's big difference younger older children still treating monolith.

If children ten big issue children ten are... schools age groups open close time? Especially younger children able self direct get much benefit online school (especially youngest age group much learning social interaction play).

In UK, schools split primary schools (11 under) secondary schools (11 over), would fit really well repeated findings age cohorts transmissibility, there's still little discussion staggering reopenings age group. percent US 72 way SA strain dominant strain US trial. top Pfizer showing 92 percent efficacy Israel currently would wager community spread new variants well. Opportunity comes, lifetime yo. I'm tired completely-unproven-by-studies point constantly coming up.

Like 99% articles posted here? see conjecture posturing whatever agenda publication has. scientists doctors learning fast, still, year, can't infer long term effects without time passing.  Godspeed UK. Hope (and guess Israel this) show solid results approach. funny people opinion never spell. Like J&amp;J Moderna? too! responsibility governments provide health wellneing citizens, course rich countries whatever try get citizens vaccinated first. Like airplane, put oxygen mask helping others. different perspective - grateful rich countries able afford research development expenses, poor countries benefit from, although later. appreciate post agree open debate. believe though bit concern regarding vaccines sitting idle literally states really worried steady supply holding back guarantee second shot time.

Now, again, debate risk/reward administering time. also think states federal government working bit smoothly ensure steady supply states comfortable giving inventory knowing coming. want push back argument solely infrastructure/logistics issue. states federal governments created bottle neck extent stringently adhering guideline. 

I agree US also going drag since phase likely going ~30% staunch opponents vaccine due cluster F politics media landscape. problem I'm hoping states closely monitor weekly averages giving there's substantial dip indicates current phase losing viable candidates want come move next phase. also seems somewhat happened lead spike vaccinations past two weeks - states began authorizing age 65 + essential workers cases helped open pool candidates quite bit further. 

The CVS Walgreens thing separate disaster. realize still far behind. read maybe 4 weeks ago got late start - basically kicking program Jan 11th so. Yup, braking sending doses UK Studies [UK] [Qatar] estimated efficacy natural infection protecting reinfection 83% 95% respectively. pretty good protection, it‚Äôs far statistical anomaly someone gets reinfected. numbers go immunity fades new variants become widespread. Implications secondary schools reopening September. go school sub/teach see yourself.

Sounds like think sweet gig anyway need teachers :) YES ! Right, might also ""super spreaders."" People going Church, restaurants, parties, front line work ready gotten. Whereas work-from-home shut ins like not. Thus, 30% population might could 70% major spreaders (numbers pulled straight ass, get main idea). Ladies gentlemen , gothim. Mr Covid defeated. mRNA vaccines future, J&amp;J vaccine important regardless. bring covid deaths crawl, even best preventing infections (which still pretty good at).

If get chance get J&amp;J vaccine, TAKE IT. don‚Äôt buy this. almost 50 percent distribution across country. makes sense given fact states don‚Äôt want risk supply second dose. issue states receiving enough doses either bottleneck production federal government. suspect it‚Äôs production. Nah, he'll throw ASDA carpark like everyone else. OP means protects mainframes Older people people pre-existing medical conditions included second stage. means vaccines. means might get point ""Everyone wants vaccine get vaccine"" US beginning summer instead end. 

The pandemic raging around world right now, people would turn 66% effective vaccine wait months get one that's 90% effective? completely illogical. 

Sure, long term need get annual booster, would make sense use effective platform. middle pandemic need take everything get even perfect. like getting J&amp;J vaccine means never get mRNA one future. separate sick healthy

This one important parts, harder sounds. sick actually ""better"" healthy household. positive tested Cases least together home. suspected, Quarantine, need isolated spaces, one may contagious, know yet, plus need Quarantine 10 days sick recover longer infection, therefore longer Isolate. like advertisement getting virus. ""Be family room again, get Covid-19 TODAY!"". sweet gig get teach them. 

Without union know quitting teaching anymore need sure!! cautionary tale Israel. mid-May less 10 cases day. Middle High schools opened 2000 day. link showing chart efficacy severe covid 85% rather 100% poster suggest. would good know definition severe. I'm Genesee county? know he's set Meijer.

If schools safe uch great job get help kids out!! think actually understanding presented you. mean ever? want J&amp;J vaccine - want Moderna vaccine. Barnier told reel in.

When Barnier becomes voice international cooperation know problems.  Good grief, common sense. [Fuck everything we're five  J&amp;J? announced. good discussion Derek Lowe /r/COVID19. Aight mortality statistics going? lot countries, oldest doesn‚Äôt die hospitals, elder care facilities. don‚Äôt know that‚Äôs case Romania, I‚Äôve seen calculations Sweden, week delay vaccinating oldest vulnerable would add hundreds deaths, compared starting groups. think lie honestly theres chance case covid school.

Maybe school reported 1 theres 1 case. 

Sounds like get school teach kids need good education! Yep. That's degree gets you. good friend co-worker always used talk position us advanced degrees prestigious university, ho-dunk online shady university degree, yet job.

Although landing first big time gig places employment look grades, takes landing gig somewhere else desperate workers work year two grades mean shit.

It‚Äôs within purview lecture morality. explain Israel‚Äôs current numbers. Surely variants spreading see almost 92 percent efficacy Pfizer. Never heard influential?

And so, I'm holding breath meaningful positive change, moment. :( Polls shown people wildly exaggerated sense risk. Like think fatality rate actually around 0.4% fraction young healthy people.

Anyways, great day stay safe! can't fix stupid...   Excellent? Oh heck no! administration promised 20 million shots end 2020. even distribute 20 million shots till close Biden's inauguration day. That's inaccurate forecasting harmful states trying plan.

Also, Trump's administration giving total numbers vaccines week week basis. makes harder states plan appointments since know kind supply getting. Biden's administration promising 3 weeks notice.

Also, changing CDC guidelines 65+ priority claiming ""release second doses"" boost supply horrible. increased demand found additional supply coming. second doses held on. shit show communication blunder. uncertainty many vaccines going distributed caused NYC cancel 23,000 vaccine appointments.

There lots failures. Excellent hardly word describe it. delusional living fear. 

I'll partying ass summer traveling world October, thank much.

Madness. Yeah. little organ brain damage. What's little psychosis among friends? Dialysis buddies life. Again, making things First one free lol Please add BREAKING headline


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* White man's burden something something assume OP meant whole country. California 300 million (or 150 million) people total number vaccinated country 23 million. know many people age hospitalized serious condition, know anything else like date admitted, whether vaccinated, long ago on.

Issue half got second dose actually gone week since, pretty much none vaccinated long enough impossible hospitalized getting COVID got second dose.

In words, data messy right make clear conclusions particular data point. need longer time interval since second shot much much information judge this. kills people act like first vaccine we've ever history mankind. We've vaccines hundreds years take become immune illnesses. take kids doctor get vaccines chicken pox measles lock room make sure spread them. get vaccinated specifically go exist world without fear getting sick. ""you better rub router face fired""

Risky google video search...? way they'd lowering symptoms reducing viral load (as immune system would already vigilant attacking virus moment invades), almost certainly slows spread, spread directly correlated viral load.

The news sloppy, shows bad state science journalism. Good news! We're dying! going live *forever!*  set system designed make person education fail complaining fails. Remote education failing trash. person education failing school gone far beyond reasonable precautions seems like possible reason close schools again. 

The describe this, seems teachers asking system designed fail kids keep remote long possible. reads like blatant act sabotaging kids education. better work.. long don‚Äôt know.  Came say this. someone else already it. Yeah I‚Äôm taking break sub think. pattern recognition skills kicked kinda posts headlines despite reality common sense often contradicting them. COVID‚Äôs cost trillions already, leave alone, it‚Äôs liable evade antibodies eventually re-rip population. (We‚Äôve seen antibody resistance popping already) way away risk eliminate virus. It‚Äôs easy let‚Äôs pretend can‚Äôt. COVID short infectious window. get people vaccinated, it‚Äôs small outbreaks popping up, start using techniques used eliminate Smallpox eliminate COVID: get case reports, quarantine, isolate, vaccinate. However 900 million vaccinations purchased far US Agreed. honestly indictment headline intentionally misleading would rather catch flu live like four months every year. Yeah 1000% increase ‚Äúsince November.‚Äù It‚Äôs confusing read, I‚Äôm sure increase rest population, maybe 700%? 550%? It‚Äôs bad clicks understanding formal studies whether vaccinated people transmit therefore responsible person would say definitely not, reason assume wouldn‚Äôt prevent it, anti-virus vaccines do. 

And mechanism action actual vaccine different RNA vaccine, end result both-namely, immune system builds response it. pretty fair assume would likely prevent transmission, vaccine. work Karolinska Sjukhuset staff ER Infection clinics definitely vaccinated, doses made available region course. number doses going health care workers outside care facilities probably vary region region though. work hospital laboratory, don‚Äôt expect get vaccinated good since don‚Äôt work close patients. Way make assumptions Wtf ""Black town""? Sound like headline South Africa 1970s. high profile case inhale virus still exhale people's faces. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Literally worst case scenario need flu shot COVID shot every year.

In way even remotely world ending.

Oh no! October might need *two* shots. drop restrictions!!!!! Nobody ""loves"" lockdowns, lmao. Nobody ever gung-ho quarantined, issue *needed*. That‚Äôs true, speak manufacturers working update vaccines meet variants head on. know want last forever thankfully science going conquer COVID That's mean. get global pandemic? normal actions led us here.  good health insurance way, ""system"" sucks real system. People say oh well countries real system there's *wait times*. There's insane wait times here, ever try getting MRI? 6 month wait list. Paying people stay wouldnt done much US 
People would still go friends house underground economy would skyrocket. Human behavior unpredictable think stay home given money pipe dream No, he‚Äôs horsepital. vaccine rollouts preventing death (at least State, cases).

Yes true, vaccines vs lockdowns 2 completely different discussions. far lockdowns, based saying regard case rate, advantage lockdowns.

I believe may agreement here. course pandemic amount people going end getting sick regardless lockdowns It‚Äôs evolution, natural selection we‚Äôre specific.
A virus infects doesn‚Äôt kill spread whole ton compose bigger portion next generation. Rinse repeat. They're people right though Selfish?

Selfish reason, Defense Production Act activated Johnson &amp; Johnson's production lines, forcing make Moderna Pfizer shots. Probably owners Johnson &amp; Johnson think they'd lose money so...

Why even allowing production capacity devoted shit vaccine?  They're busy VA people mission essential personnel right though. pull them? feel like contributing factors could also population probably already either got virus older folk getting vaccine. spread like wildfire last month half. Thursday, said LA county total 1.1M people tested positive. That‚Äôs people went got tested I‚Äôd put figure around 3M -4M. 

This indicates one charts LA county 9.1k people vaccinated every 100k resident. let‚Äôs say 700k - 900k people vaccinated here. could looking close 50% population currently carrying immunity either vaccine contracted cleared covid. Earth talking about? 

They continuously sequencing huge numbers virus samples. 

This vital part understanding what‚Äôs going virus it‚Äôs variants. took 3 months get evidence particular variant transmissible.

The U.K. much sequencing rest world put together. end sight also enrolled week. side effects, could gotten placebo. I‚Äôve also read people turned get vaccine UK symptoms either. also possible dose #2 notice something. get vaccine Edmonton Alberta lot bitter people downvoted you. There's range experiences throughout pandemic, mentally struggling thriving, middle putting quite miserable....

I guess misery loves company, OK, find reason hate life join pity party Guy called ""please tread daddy"" loves lockdowns. woulda think? anyone actually investigate claims? companies cdc/who literally say vaccine stop slow spread. purpose slightly mitigate symptoms. Ultimately way end mass scale vaccination That's J&amp;J vaccine still approved yet. current vaccines used America (Pfizer &amp; Moderna) 95% efficacy two-weeks 2nd dose. They're reporting scientific findings. issue messaging, reality. experts warning us vaccines already becoming less effective mutations they're magic bullet. LoL. required get flu shots either. 

If don't, wear mask. 

Flu shots way lot hospitals friends at. Lol okay one making leave house bud. vast majority people like isolated rest society Fyi even vaccinated, need careful herd immunity kicks in

There's enough evidence yet vaccine prevents asymptomatic transmissions, lessens chance catching overall effect body Maybe fact weve full lockdown 2 months curfew week+?  Based 200+ year history capitalism America, one confident employers put safety ahead profitability right thing. determine particular flus circulating flu season starts distribute vaccine. isn‚Äôt every year. depends flus large. took 11 months WARP SPEED, unprecedented, wouldn‚Äôt able effectively protect public seasonal flu wouldn‚Äôt get vaccine ready time. mean forget law, know hospital would willing accept liability. sure fuck hire nurse willing vaccinate pandemic. need vaccinating age groups actually getting spreading virus. Australian lockdown would‚Äôve never worked US though. US simply big densely populated work. Thousands, maybe millions people would lose jobs, economy would completely crash, even beginning would definitely riots. UCLA didn‚Äôt entire population LA city they‚Äôd btw started wfh job. great work sweaty kitchen 2 masks on. However, grunt whole life used computer work, I'm finding difficult. made full paycheck, probably last much longer. hoping another stimulus check, keep indoors another month finding another job. government paying us monthly say home whole time, less people would've died. early animal models etc. looks like RNA vaccines novavax give kind immunity prevents transmission, adenoviral vectored vaccines reducing amount virus transmitted fully neutralize. remember correctly, preventing transmission frequently question well vaccine stimulates production IgA rather commonly tracked IgG. Daniel Griffin man Guess always comfortable little liberal hell hole, Flint really hell hole love strange reason, although always assumed people like tolerant kind, ect
I remember going date guy casually mentioning proud walking 3 miles dark way vote Obama shitty road. assumed Obama voter too. not. run then, would saved heartache  Look swine flu vaccine 1976 nobody bothered ask ""well happens"" healthcare system want replaced healthcare system want, admit there's healthcare system?

Jeez sounds like tea parties every day. Apparently that's happened chicken pox. got infant within months vaccine rollout. Luckily deadly disease. bought three lol. Experts: ""72% good 95%!""

In January February 2020 watched medical experts stand behind podiums tell masks necessary work. 

They knew lie. 

They said knew enough masks go around, mask-protection needed reserved medical professionals first responders. 

So lied us. thought ""greater good.""

Now, know enough ""good vaccine"" go around. also know ""greater good"" vaccine everyone, even mostly shit vaccine. 

They lied us last year. they're lying us again. 

Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine that's good enough get peasantry back work, that's all. preserves comfort institutions normalcy rich, absolutely getting Pfizer Moderna. 

They're lying us again. like masks.  first read title ‚ÄúCOVID vaccines slowly spreading virus already‚Äù confused lol 'Herd Immunity' term ever refer vaccination. End Story.  probably true, know two people caught twice Jesus Christ. J&amp;J vaccine isn‚Äôt weak. Oh ok see that. Yeah definitely tricky. want see type mandates guess wish people willing own. virus mutates. doesn‚Äôt mean completely wipes away protective immunity built up. 

Nobody saying does, mutations made resistant vaccines *it continue so* evolves even mutations able bypass previously built immunity - wouldn‚Äôt every respiratory virus we‚Äôve faced last 200 years deadly first exposed us? Wouldn‚Äôt still wearing masks 1918 pandemic ‚Äòavoid mutations‚Äô?

That's called ""novel"" coronavirus. stronger easier spread mqny respiratory diseases we've dealt thus far maybe, build immunity vaccines virus longer novel bodies .... get sick every year mild flu recover?

Assuming mutations slow down, yeah. We're playing catch right it. That‚Äôs absurd. suspect may upspike audiologist appointments related virus. ü§£ even fact sentence italics article good well researched, swedish rules still relatively light compared european countries. understand timing well, last ""tightening"" happened one month ago 

As sidenote, infections hospitalizations falling fast. Since January 5th constantly 40% less peak. result achieved Germany England expense much harsher lockdowns I'm scientist room people, can't help feel ""information age"" actually accelerated dissent questioning part scientific process since many people review hypothesis counter-arguments arise much quickly. watching outside may think science place, can't help think they're working breakneck speed general public sees. work hospital southeastern USA, many coworkers decided refuse vaccine. unbelievable. 5% us vaccinated, vaccinated ones ones spreading first place

definitely result Xmas/NYE surge dying down

let's see Superbowl goes UK also got 12% really impressive.  reopened governor's mansion public? definitely need booster year. remember speed mutates proportional number active cases. there's insanely high number active cases right we're seeing tons new mutations. However reduce infections 90% globally rate new strains appear reduced accordingly. closer get eliminating virus less worry new strains.

Unfortunately appears political actually eliminate disease certain become endemic surely playing ""whack mole"" new strains long time. would certainly like see nuance messaging don‚Äôt feel like smashing head wall Taxi drivers aren‚Äôt healthcare workers, risk assumed. Dentists even risk. People assume, did, nurses vaccinated. shocked four nurses crowded room mother asked told everyone vaccinated. 

You valid point everyone opt this, way force without risking shortage. shouldn‚Äôt given informed consent visitor mother patient? lives put risk, really pisses one informed this. aren‚Äôt taking small flu here; talking potentially deadly virus. Same. managers home working night, see reason subordinates answer emails 5pm. 

We‚Äôre need territory haven‚Äôt regulated work home yet. vaccinated teachers getting covid 2 weeks dose 2? self serving made remarks finding Le Pen polling ahead next year‚Äôs elections. popularity decline hoping combination antivaxx anti U.K. rhetoric help turn around.

You managed avoid answering question think knows EMA scientists. think logic/emotion completely normal would lying said agree extent. ""problem every solution"" conundrum: fear sells newspapers. course they're going start fear mongering variants, failing report many vaccine producers optimistic vaccine solutions work variants well. more, rest us hunkering lockdowns repeatedly save human lives, happily kept partying months, shit spread much country dire need vaccines right using colonizer money get ahead everyone. actually think entitled irresponsible bullshit. Damn, point glad GTFO EU. Every virus mutates. doesn‚Äôt mean completely wipes away protective immunity built up. 

If mutations able bypass previously built immunity - wouldn‚Äôt every respiratory virus we‚Äôve faced last 200 years deadly first exposed us? Wouldn‚Äôt still wearing masks 1918 pandemic ‚Äòavoid mutations‚Äô?

Or maybe, build immunity vaccines virus longer novel bodies .... get sick every year mild flu recover? Next time try bigger population  Yeah think it‚Äôs delusional think wouldn‚Äôt become case time. even read article? 

For starters it‚Äôs focused UK, US. 

And clearly stated ‚Äúsome‚Äù restrictions, restrictions now. Specifically they‚Äôre talking continued travel border restrictions. likely mandatory screenings vaccination requirements move countries depending status vaccinations infections. 

Nowhere imply anybody would try make stay home even continue social distancing 2 years. Stop spreading false narratives meet agenda worked psych hospital long time ago. med/surg site. get flu vaccine every year unless medical religious exemption didn‚Äôt want us passing flu patients. hardly resistance, we‚Äôre talking 2000‚Äôs anti-vax movement social media didn‚Äôt stronghold people. There's risk promising low number, though, seen.

Experts public vociferously complain: *goal* slightly *worse* last week? 

Setting non-ambitious goals makes administration look bad, too.

The 100 million goal insanely low, achieve great things aim high, low. don‚Äôt know, didn‚Äôt feel comfortable asking talking‚ÄîI sensed felt shameful getting Covid. expect approval ratings sink even days go by. that's like saying lockdowns, generally freer country like USA, could EVER work, right? 

Meaning, former President said March-April, ""Okay, sporting events stay home two weeks increased unemployment, also going mandate (federally, somehow) closing grocery stores, restaurants takeout, schools (public private), banks, small-medium-large businesses Walmart local construction firm, etc."" - idea American people would rise draconian measures inner cities Baltimore Chicago plains Iowa Wisconsin complete misunderstanding America ""is"" American people ""are"". Even grocery stores UK open. 

It's stupid argument. lockdowns SEEMED worked China mean would worked US, Italy, Spain, France, UK, India, etc.  13 years old 16 weeks pregnant ...poor child. stop patchwork facilities people gain access based insurance ""insurance"" replaced ""healthcare"" I‚Äôm non frontline nurse outpatient surgery center, one us able get vaccine due shortages Ohio keep rolling groups. Hearing this... talking CNA friend yesterday giving hope. home works also new cases since beginning month. Last recorded case January 10th. 

I'm hoping good news continues. makes hopeful. almost certainly real reason.

I know crackpot media people watching that's ""stirring anti-science fears months"", every report I've read watched basically laid science reported statistics. I've never seen ""anti-science"" piece actual journalist.

Bloggers, hand...but there's much that. reminder: Zero-Covid protection possibility infection realistic objectives. Attempting would crush economy collective mental health, beyond repair, ultimately fail anyway. 

A combination effective vaccines enable us minimize serious outcomes goal clear enable returning normal. Humans lived respiratory viruses forever; order functional society, need completely taken them. Thus, array vaccines levels playing field. worst, brings us situation we're already used to. evolution need worry about, intelligent design.

Mutations random, go nowhere. vaccine makes harder virus replicate, random mutation makes easier replicate run wild become dominant person's body, one they'll spread others.

Not trying doomsayer. people need take precauations they're told, even get vaccine. No. doesn't. slightly mitigates symptoms. Read yourself.  hospitals there‚Äôs huge correlation education levels vaccine acceptance. Nearly 100% doctors nurse practitioners, low 70s% RN, mid 40s LPN/ tech. 30s staff (maint, food service etc...). 

In case, optional year legality required compliance currently unclear given emergency use authorization vs fda approval. vaccine fully approved, required condition employment require flu shot. like Even vaccinated, still spread disease. easily, can.

So vaccinated staff still dangerous patients, unfortunately:( we're going keep wearing masks long vaccine distribution full swing.

The good news vaccine it, longer worry people care safety protocols. They'll endangering themselves, you. doubtful. Yeah dont think quite understand lockdown entailed. seem think ""barricaded homes"", closer ""be less fucking stupid please"". Korean family America went university America myself, hope Americans send vaccines Canada. 

I family California. lot Koreans family America people know family member died coronavirus America. way Canadians reacted glee coronavirus deaths America appalling made sick stomach multiple occasions.

With Canada's high coronavirus death toll, one would think Canadians would sympathetic toward coronavirus victims. 

Growing up, English teachers public school hagwon Canadian always bragged polite Canadians are. years, I'm still waiting see it. 

Sorry rant, I've ""here"" Canadians cheering coronavirus problems America many us Korea worried sick family members there. Sure that‚Äôs good. Also, didn‚Äôt say anything patients. said staff don‚Äôt appear falling ill. I've said several times, I'll say again:

get. fucked. covid.

Fuck outta' here. vaccinated doesn‚Äôt give magical barrier prevents covid viruses entering body. teaches body recognize (probably most) forms virus EARLY enough mount immune response, faster body didn‚Äôt get educated. 


Having watch tower doesn‚Äôt make fort suddenly immune impermeable attackers. scout watch tower keep watch alert army recognize enemies mean defenses mobilized way quickly. decreases chances fort destroyed attack, compared scout watch tower knew look for. referring to? propaganda? haha read way! Ask them. probably   really. Isolation horrible matter age. Oh cherry picking specific question applies insured people: ""are happy insurance?""

 also, people oblivious fact insurance exactly costs driven anything pay pocket.

We would better banning health insurance people pay pocket universally letting health insurance exist. scam. actual fuck? test literally available EVERY STATE EXCEPT NEW YORK. 

Did Trump administration devise test something? lmao sure ‚Äòin first 10 days‚Äô really shows effectiveness vaccine. Okay end game vaccines aren‚Äôt magic bullet variants (gasp) might elude vaccines? magic bullet? end? 
You see public health messaging terrible throughout pandemic? link congressman got vaccinated yet people office got sick.  right , though , proof got sick I‚Äôm going claim clinical expertise specific subject history mRNA vaccines/therapeutics. data huge well designed clinical trials though millions safely vaccinated.

Comparing NY pre lockdown wild spread nursing homes current Florida? Kids pick fear parents. going anywhere close back normal years

and understand fully. Meanwhile, people die per day total. still insinuating act vaccinating people somehow increases likelihood vaccine resistant strain last sentence. not.

Rolling vaccine slowly, mix vaccinated unvaccinated people side side, pandemic still raging provides Covid opportunity test random mutations people vaccinated.

This provides selection opportunities Covid evolve.

I seen term ""stress"" used describe environment microbe potential hosts developed immunity. stress become pattern recognition system strains evade immunity presented vaccinated people. data comes South Korea problem. contact trace accurately. England, could vaccine help new strain? Yeah general fear media Covid basically harmless kids I'd loved see numbers girl went high school sent definitive proof Facebook Bill Gates wants scoop eyeballs vaccination appointment. 

Are saying people \*gasp* *lie* internet?! You‚Äôre right, let‚Äôs New Zealand did. 

First, become island South Pacific Ocean... list ingredients Moderna/Pfizer incredibly simple, none concerned pharmacist

Interesting - specifically experience pharmacist involving mRNA vaccines delivered via lipid nanoparticles? AFAIK technology around around 5 years never tested 1/100th scale Moderna Pfizer products. True probably Canada Germany, Southern Europe getting worst worlds. say 60% fewer? Quit pushing hospital occupancy bullshit maybe start posting ICU covid ward numbers. significant sections hospitals empty due lower non-covid patient numbers majority priority assigned ICUs. Ok :) think people got spooked. massive extended Mexican family LA County. Last November, much family gave starting host large family gatherings. things went shit December. media coverage local news dire. importantly, started know people actually sick serious complications. Christmas, people spooked stayed home. Probably getting closer herd immunity. point we're probably getting pretty close, least amongst engage high risk behavior. Chill. kids iPads school. sitting room kids iPads way different sitting home iPads. probably best continue nothing half-assing vaccine rollout. help ""investigators"". vaccines stop spreading virus (or least, know not...they study developing it)...so nurse's detriment take vaccine. chance take one yet I'm certainly trying leapfrog anyone needs time comes getting mine. understand vaccines, probably much people sub, believe vaccine I'll effects besides needle jabbed arm. 

That said get riled people quick criticise people decisions without information. Reminds lot kids bullied wear shitty clothes school. 

Kinda reaction someone different opinion Reddit people pile call names.  contagious disease known history spreads march healthy 20 year old almost dies march vegetable forever afterward literally disease 

no. Yeah, *easily* see even intelligent people feeling less inclined wear masks vaccinated. Finland. relied completely EU turned bad choice. Even back-of-beyond Serbia managed vaccinate 400,000 people, despite high level avaxx sentiment admittedly using Chinese Sinopharm vaccine. Due, doubt dodgy deals done Vuƒçiƒá co. behind scenes Chinese. Wonder sweet contracts promised. mum got vaccine though, happy. Mitigation != cure-all. Spain able keep infections low summer, gone America due inaction. Stop defeatist basic precautions. People sick wear masks anyways, adopted countries. It‚Äôs common decency. Damn. problem they're already hired. huge lawsuit hands fired them, especially EUA. prefer push people make verifiable claims provide sources others actually evaluate comments read reddit. really. 

Because 9/11 gulf war affected .002% population, rather 20% Yeah, reddit dude might die kills people infect others vaccinated? Unless SARS-COV-2 evolves way makes far deadly, that's unlikely. ? said ? watch Fox News ? feedback may interesting.

I work support staff school (sports coach).

We 225 eligible vaccine joined Google Meet two weeks ago discuss. 

There big group questions upcoming clinic asked could wait offered JNJ vaccine passed clinic.

Today received email saying 80 individuals changed mind want one current vaccines Monday notify want attend one upcoming clinics.

Found interesting quickly email came out; perception everything! working home, pregnant unsure due lack data, putting bc recently COVID, I‚Äôm sure antivaxers too, I‚Äôm hopeful we‚Äôll increase uptake daily. there‚Äôs endgame restrictions pointless unless power grab acting like virus thinking being? less virus there, less mutations going be. happen randomly. virus trying avoid measures, measures work better around mutations, makes ones prominent. Without measures, would less ppl infected mutations, ppl infected original one. Cool now, please make vaccine accessible us lowly poor people Terrible add anecdote contrast, semi big Swedish city typically see majority people wear masks recommendations apply. think ton people signed got front line think countries like New Zealand able keep infections per capita comparatively low? tried nothing we're ideas, man!  members Congress Massachusetts tested positive coronavirus, one receiving doses vaccine, reminder people still vulnerable infection vaccinated, particularly two weeks receiving second dose.

It‚Äôs exactly headline says. amazing! Must great feeling. Thank do. idea legal issue involved here, hospitals area staff wear flu shot tags name badges. know would different. started using Bing. that's mRNA vaccines like Pfizer Moderna. ones like Astrazeneca, J+J, Coronavax, etc around 50% (chinese coronovax) 75% (Johnson, Astrazeneca) PREVENTION. means there's 50%-30% chance still getting covid...just less symptoms.

&amp;nbsp;

My country getting astrazeneca 5 million people. Pfizer 4 million people. coronavax 1 million people. wish I'd get Pfizer one, astrazeneca one that's available March - May...then that's one I'm getting. I'd like Pfizer, long I'm protected severe symptoms, breathing problems, permanent lung damage, I'm a-ok.

&amp;nbsp;

You're definitely right. 5%. 35%, 30%. matter. long severe symptoms, we're clear, especially vaccines rushed. would also like point article mentions even get shots takes 7 days get full benifit. Trying bring back! good hear vaccines reach poorer countries well. need entire world vaccinated unfortunately take long time. like 12 1/2% effective lmao going work especially cities countries rely heavily tourism. destroy economies. Source? Last saw obesity associated 2x increase mortality one study. contrast, increase mortality age 500x 20s 80s. Gloves work use new pair everything do. Otherwise still touching much contact points. process fighting illness - would test positive negative? That‚Äôs true statement. Masks reduce risks eliminate it. masks distance reduce more, time place increases more. get Johnson &amp; Johnson wait ones 90% 40 mln. 
10 % EU Population. 

Von der Leyen brings shame. Hard say fast Canada others would vaccinate huge supply issue. Right Canada getting shafted vaccine manufacturers decided cut supplies. need give people chance get home though. many people smdo thi k afford stuck foreign coubtry months? Well mean you‚Äôre way less likely experience symptoms, wouldn‚Äôt decrease spread lot? Coughing would make way viral dangerous There‚Äôs many variables roll ‚Äúeveryone wears masks‚Äù. There‚Äôs way know exactly lifestyle is. 

They could wear mask work home. 
At home work. 

They could wear masks work hang people home don‚Äôt wear masks work public get way. 

They could wearing ‚Äúface covering‚Äù little safety value call ‚Äúmask‚Äù. 

I‚Äôm aware possibilities I‚Äôve seen first hand. We‚Äôve dealing covid year now. That‚Äôs plenty time notice behaviors people accurately assess negative impacts come from. also google. rely research. Today day! 72 year old dad finally gets first vaccine. almost year straight I've called every day, making sure safe wearing mask everywhere. feel weight lifting. 1 case South Carolina confirmed think. That‚Äôs know now. Interesting. seems entirely fair health care workers vaccine. based cases generally falling. article explains Public Health England cross reference new cases they've vaccinated not, there's apparently early detectable statistical effect seems show vaccinated people protected. paper due publication next days easier know exactly happening then. However, [asymptomatic transmission emerged major driver 

Prove it, Vox, linking article April 2020.

Counterpoint: Also, anyone knew anything nature virus- always going endemic. highly contagious, airborne virus going eradicated zero- Covid. people knew anything viruses would predicted this. 

Once hospitalizations deaths stopped, getting Covid going big deal. like flu anything. (I know going bring long Covid myocarditis whatever else, convinced actual data common permanent people claim, also happens rarely many viruses, sorry sorry.) doubtful leader wants kill whole industries risk financial ruin. Ohhh like one. yes ... that's point...that's get R 1 without restrictions behavior changes... voice pretty good think ""by far"" lesser evil pointless describe alternative. Yeah meme vaccine rollout bad annoying. US currently vaccinating, average, equivalent entire population Dallas, TX every day. rate increasing every day.

Compare EU vaccinations rates anywhere world outside small countries like Israel we're pretty damn good.  US legally required disclose medical history (with exceptions).

Vaccinations important exception. example, can't register student live dormitory without received certain vaccinations. marathon, sprint. countries end mortality rate, I'll take country protects human rights one doesn't. Im nurse, got covid vaccinated x2. opinion ridiculous request.  think people access vaccine moral responsibility get it? think do, again, realize it‚Äôs complicated. fact 92, maximum 8 one outbreak, shows cohort-based mitigation strategies effective. Yeah want hear rolls out. Good news sure everyone expect like mmr, 97% effectiveness also prevent infection. Don‚Äôt worry virus going become endemic new vaccines need made every year average life expectancy humans drop years next century. Could new variant spread schools. Never assume know every trick virus come with. heard that. article May 2020, assumes vaccines available. Check source little next time attempt fear monger. means Republican states screwed. Got it. data back up? that's true regular vaccines necessary, healthcare workers getting vaccines cleared work would enough somehow cover everyone. good lowering case rate translate lowering death rate? people's loved ones likely die state locked one didn't, good lower case rate? every single photo people wearing masks show minimum one person wearing improperly? Like hard reason give clear number? 6-fold decrease sounds better compared 82% fewer antibodies.

82% fewer sounds close ineffective. Someone article thread stated fact mild asymptomatic people covid ‚Äúsevere permanent lung scarring‚Äù. stated like it‚Äôs completely true. skeptic subs little intense well. balance thread Yup. grandfather delayed heart procedure last April afraid going hospital time. passed away September. 

No guarantee procedure would've successful added much time. also possible procedure, might contracted covid hospital less time ended with. We'll never know. Yes, general idea prepare worse, hoping best. Assume caution take ICU beds also issue many places including poster located. would thought 6.4x decrease would 1/6.4 15% effective... know right. Trust us, we're experts...  Thank God. Hope. literally bought 3x much Astrazeneca. Although good results Pfizer Moderna doubled orders. EU acted slow. easily could front US bickering internally. Well case biggest, harshest lockdown ended earlier predicted high compliance region saw 100 days zero local covid cases, covid popped squashed thanks mask wearing contact tracing. 

Without vaccine use lockdowns, what's alternative? Let virus run rampant? Lockdowns lesser two evils far.  vaccine approved kids 16, trials 12-15 year olds starting now.  Trials under-12s horizon yet. Regardless Fauci said TV, could easily 2023 2024 time there's fully-approved vaccine young children. think Germany eliminate virus like Australia New Zealand did? True, doesn‚Äôt mean can‚Äôt get back normal time. knows many viruses random person right anything harm health? cares? Yes long enforce everyone, salon Ive gone covid crowded requires masks everyone feel comfortable. IMO, concentrate treatments. else gonna do? see option. wish shared confidence. I‚Äôm expecting new strains pop years. Hopefully vaccines catch them, we‚Äôre going living COVID world lot longer fall.

It‚Äôs great first world vaccinated, long going take vaccinate developing world. little data pregnancy, denying that, denied pregnant women based scientific knowledge have. one forcing pregnant women able make choice. I‚Äôm thankful given option need balance living quality life. Existence living. We've year, 5 years takes, that? 10? Yes, even 95% efficacy rate, 5% people take vaccine get infected. That's math works. one else gets vaccinated, pandemic continue

Oh good analysis ""consequence"" may active, organized resistance public. implying shouldn‚Äôt lockdowns hospitals collapsing? Either way going totally mess up. article mentions 110k excess deaths since May people scared go hospital, dying cars, 70k deaths official statistics show. read. Perhaps worth taking seriously? source. still transmit coronavirus **This another question researchers still investigating, said Boslett.**‚ÄúIt‚Äôs possible could get vaccine, immune response, maybe enough immune response prevent asymptomatic infection, still transmit virus.‚Äù

AKA, we‚Äôre still 100% sure. 

It‚Äôs definitive yes answer, sounds less like Boslett saying yes like they‚Äôre saying people might form correct immune response vaccine. Less like everyone able spread COVID vaccination like certain specific cases, maybe. That‚Äôs definitive yes. That's answer want looks like may well answer Mother Nature gives us. may able keep variants. Scary stuff. Europe poorly vaccine rollout. USA, UK, Israel moving fast pace picking speed

Nothing invoked. Stop emotional nonsense. saying now, underestimate someone actually job charge. thing going ramp faster believe.

We essentially executive branch now. propose re-assigned non-public facing positions?

Yes, depending needed.

I completely agree people forced vaccinated, also think responsible potential repercussions decision impact patients personnel (e.g., people can't get vaccinated medical reasons).

Objectively, people voluntarily get vaccinated pose greater risks everybody. risks decision means reassignment positions riskier choice less likely medical impact, sounds like ordinary risk management me.

To clear, mean kind punishment, simply employers able rearrange assignments light whether people vaccinated. people like potential reassignment, choice still medical issue. least pandemic over, think kind employer discretion available people corresponding discretion get vaccinated.

This America we've living past 40 years people still burying heads sand. whole fight mitigation measures--not lockdowns, anything could actually help--is attack workers' rights people still seem understand that. People dying getting seriously ill everywhere US. question whether areas implementing shutdowns better areas shutdowns. Typical EU. Always backing there's criticism.

People may get booster later something, fantastic sure wish US would restrict long distance travel new variants every town city. Either start vaccinated 10 million people day. two friends 6 months apart Maybe poor countries make vaccine wait turn. 

Cut woke bullshit. Similar types vaccines also work like that. J&amp;J running trial prove check much difference might make. Yeah, normalized cases day doesn‚Äôt mean we‚Äôre getting pummeled virus still ""vaccine nationalism"" work, way protect protect everyone.

If get vaccine must wear masks gloves times shift.

I imagine remain case, however even vaccinated people wear masks gloves so...  messed vaccine situation... Ultimately ones blame suspect. give anti-EU movements countries like Italy substantial boost revolution country needs one got morons complaining ""voting interference."" making grave incorrect assumption vaccinated person can't spread virus still.

A sentence never thought would ever say year ago. Okay, glad realized Americans like healthcare. Sorry minority hate waiting phone whatever. really hope right. I‚Äôm Florida don‚Äôt think getting anything like Pretty sure continue like flu vaccine.

You say want, bit ass wearing PPE everyone come across protection.

If get flu vaccine wear masks times shift happened. would COVID. never everyone wash hands wear gloves anyway part change much. Florida natural buffers (weather) reaching levels NY, shutdown like NY? CA also warm weather, pretty bad overall despite strictest measures US? Usually means thing.  would news agency post something isn‚Äôt true?

It's says lot sad state news media can't tell facetious :-/

Though Vox generally pretty solid. I'm surprised. think author-by-author them. Developed countries course vaccinate citizens first. talk unfair that's going change damn thing. That's every pandemic that's one continue nice vaccines easy alter. makes little difference. Jabs arms hard part current slow pace vaccinating world proving.

Eagerly waiting second dose hubby's first dose (I able get job work healthcare, get state). issue ""lockdown"" California name. Many businesses enforcement agencies followed lockdown procedure. Many individuals ignored guidelines continued frequent businesses well engage social activities close proximity others. certainly help minute downturn cases, immediately relax guidelines, even people trying follow rules half-assing point. ""Here's authority wrong bad!"" we‚Äôre gonna need stop pearl clutching cases eventually. deaths gotta open up. virus us forever.  That's EU agreement manufacturers Russian Chinese vaccines.

BBC News - Covid: What‚Äôs happening EU vaccine countries still allowed make separate deals vaccine makers negotiating EU. Hungary agreed buy two million doses Russian Sputnik-V vaccine."" I'm thankful Nova Scotia cases low. least count people following public health orders (for part) get enough vaccines make difference. Yes, I've wondering thing. county reporting around 180-220 cases day throughout second half November first half December, pre-holiday days seeing around 275 cases. second half December saw us steadily declining 115 cases day, currently 75 daily cases. 

I work retail, know people cautious holiday season previously; less so, fact. thing think schools played far larger role community spread led believe. Covid deniers. AMLO sure help. guess what, 3 variant mutations born 3 different location. sure right, nothing behaviour... stop it, clue talking about. Genuine question: would concerned lower effectiveness J&amp;J vaccine that‚Äôs one got? real? got first moderna dose Thursday, everything I've reading sounded like protected two weeks second dose would mid March. protection would really ease mind working unmasked children. benefit waiting 14 days quarantining visiting family you‚Äôre living someone? went store 14 days ago instance, possible one gets covid gives 10 days later without symptoms, 14 days waited?  regular elementary school middle school serves large homeless population 1 teacher (mild) case. kids classes range 12-18 kids per class that's normal.

I'm sure area interested Northeast absolutely gorgeous summer. Cape Cod beaches, White mountain hiking, Boston.

There much do. thing box contains surgical masks says doesn‚Äôt stop spread COVID. Evidence: BLM protests. Two whole weeks peep COVID  94.1% 95% efficiency vs 66% huge difference death table.

The recurrent zoonotic spillover coronaviruses (CoVs) human population underscores need broadly active countermeasures. employed directed evolution approach engineer three SARS-CoV-2 antibodies enhanced neutralization breadth potency. One affinity-matured variants, ADG-2, displays strong binding activity large panel sarbecovirus receptor binding domains (RBDs) neutralizes representative epidemic sarbecoviruses high potency. Structural biochemical studies demonstrate ADG-2 employs distinct angle approach recognize highly conserved epitope overlapping receptor binding site. immunocompetent mouse models SARS COVID-19, prophylactic administration ADG-2 provided complete protection respiratory burden, viral replication lungs, lung pathology. Altogether, ADG-2 represents promising broad-spectrum therapeutic candidate clade 1 sarbecoviruses. co-worker like this. He's totally sane regarding things turned opportunity get shot week rest school got included. outright ban international air travel? uv light disinfectant systems installed plane trains buses? Sad.

Where hearing that? Wear mask distance long? Forever? No, sorry. I‚Äôm giving another year world vaccines.  lesson ‚Äúthere consequences actions‚Äù? Dude sounds like untreated OCD. surprising, Canada bought vaccines per person country world! It‚Äôs supply Chain. Got Kaiser (California) morning

The people charge need start planning worst far whatsoever even though virus proven worst case scenario every single fear we've it. Similar things happened 1918.  say Newsom, Cuomo, Whitmer much lower approval rating DeSantis Noem. So, right back started causing drama? world thinks EU stealing vaccines, they‚Äôve even manage it. would interesting (yet unethical) experiment investigate deaths caused viruses restrictions, without vaccinations, immunity strains influenza virus coronaviruses. would get different results per strain influenza would get similar mortality diseases probably higher IFR influenza. however, compare SARS-CoV-2 influenza vaccinations think cause many less deaths flu. probably due much much better vaccines prevent Covid-19 disease. would call preparation real world.

Delivers summer.   Well we're talking number people vaccinated, number doses given, we're quite there. like J&amp;J vaccine performance preventing infection okay. Sure vaccine prevents severe infection; however, someone gets vaccinated believes protected COVID/severe COVID, risk putting others vaccinated risk they'll guaranteed strolling around unaware.  This, imho, makes asymptomatic transmission worse. must realize every infected person mutation incubator. B.1.351 already bad enough reinfection lowering even best vaccines' efficacy. almost nothing stop number mutation incubators practically 50/50 chance. One could even argue works virus' benefit. eventually elected officials stop listening actions consequences. gotta understand there‚Äôs lot people ‚Äústupid.‚Äù 

Well right that. Yes current deaths mainly come massive outbreak December early January. started using AZ outbreak done enough yet. Each. 400m total. Agreed, guy obviously idea he's talking about. earlier claimed UK provided funding trying claim vaccine paid for. Probably best waste energy certainly hope you‚Äôre right. honestly fear masks never really go away people gotten attached safety identity icon. would LOVE wrong that... We, (and bringing back article) Chicago were/are asking that. 12-18 kids per class way safe. 

I happy work type environment, school transmission happens can't follow simple guidelines cdc put exactly happening school. say zero evidence school transmission, tell get 40 6th graders science class (not class) 2 students get covid exact time friends, happened school.

I‚Äôm going see friend...yeah I‚Äôm wearing one.  Everything biased blindly support Kejri :) it? also ask people better politicians they're criticized?

My country 10 million people think few, americans can't 300 million? real? competent leadership White House, I‚Äôm optimistic make sure state governments vaccinating people. Every state issues vaccinating people early January, indicator poor leadership federal government.


Federal funding vaccination efforts fix distribution issues help. excited live normal life again. can't believe I'd miss wearing masks, talking travelling. bias evident. sounds like propaganda put make people accept less effective vaccine.

Why anyone accept less effective vaccine better vaccines? pay company produce less effective vaccine could help produce effective varieties? made hypothesis (that safe effective children) stated need experiment.

That *not* unscientific. 

If vaccine safe effective children, trouble reaching herd immunity. is. Wishful thinking substitute reality. I'm starting think wish caught April could done back then. vaccines coming EU UK Pfizer vaccines bought paid for.

There evidence astra zeneca vaccines sent EU UK. initial doses sent fill finish EU returned UK. UK complete supply chain astra zeneca vaccine. 

The EU astra zeneca factories issues due delayed timing. EU factories EU, UK factories UK. job UK send extra vaccine doses Europe EU delayed signing contract causing supply issues. [Rights exist people probably know difference vaccines going silver bullet science. Listen saying, particularly Dr Fauci. 

The solution absolutely protection all, let virus cull weak, old, etc. Obviously that's answer. People already tired masks. Making even mask guidelines make people stop together.

Yes would prevent transmission cost? People's mental health already toilet going try tell even home safe COVID? 

Sorry. would never million years fly. want fine expect everyone else live ridiculous standards fear something never fully go away. good thing someone like elected office. immensely unpopular. Rallies happened world wide general consensus outsource rallies super spreaders. [this map upsetting regardless article: [Rich countries hoarding Covid-19 getting screwed yet again. people subreddit losing shit wait months return normal - imagine potentially wait *years* pandemic end. also increases chance vaccine resistant variant making way wealthier countries.

i wish kind global subsidy vaccine production poorer countries - wait multiple years johnson johnson style vaccine insane. feel everyone situation, espicially people without reliable access healthcare esp emergency care.  thing mutating exactly expected first - slowly. I‚Äôve heard there‚Äôs nonzero chance one mutations completely evading vaccines...but there‚Äôs also nonzero chance winning millions lottery getting killed falling vending machine. better job Cuomo Pfizer says base 200m doses end May Moderna says 200m end June .

That likely cover anyone wants vaccine quickly get choose May/June hold out. I‚Äôm one individuals first week phase 3 trial. got second shot Wednesday. I‚Äôll 3rd appointment February 12 readout second shot, getting really good data internally novavax Valentine‚Äôs Day. think comment ridiculous, think people wearing masks *others'* homes. seems like lot people mentality masks can't worn houses, even would wear masks hanging group people outdoors. No, risk factor. means take woman equally aged healthy man, man 160 % greater chance dying woman get infected. fuck kids! think underestimating catastrophic last year kids. catch up. Many won‚Äôt. understood nobody died bit unclear articles read yesterday. you‚Äôre right 85% figure, whatever exactly means. excited see antibody move clinic soon! Oh man, thanks giving good laugh morning!  happens trials doesn‚Äôt show it‚Äôs safe effective children? can‚Äôt assume will, unsientific. one said real. doubt many people. Many know tired restrictions government telling cannot every day. honestly enough. never zero risk. Getting car accident risk every time get one, ban cars? I‚Äôm this. better nothing see way people wear masks agree waste. would say 80% people cover mouth let alone nose mask. dislike headlines like this. trying gain acceptance vaccine 66% effective preventing COVID.

Death bad outcome virus even though certainly worst.

Lifelong health problems also terrible.

I really want option vaccine J&amp;J vaccine. Imagine believing Joe Biden competent..lol

Unless talking another leader another country case..I apologize  Fixed comment population.not sure Google's first result far off. Oddly enough study take account vaccines 100% preventative severe disease death around (for mRNA ones) 95% effective preventing infection. However, PCR accounts virus present throat nose actually tell infected Covid-19 disease. Real world data provide detailed information months come. missing MAIN point. Forcefully injecting anything wrong. Seat belts external. U funny hell tho punking opinion I‚Äôll give u thatüòÇ Says company 72% protection rate opposed others 95% protection two shots. many people refuse them? Canada said sex using gloryhole. don‚Äôt know rate vaccinated people transmit. almost certainly much inhibited real tired hearing crazy doomsday hypothetical mutations *may* evade vaccine.

First UK/SA variant evading vaccine. Experts come Vaccines still effective slightly reduced rather take good news, people need jump *Well vaccines may work two new super variant comes around. need restrictions sure variants*

Can please happy mostly rear view summer countries prioritized vaccines. 

We. are. so. close. terrifies shut ins. bad J&amp;J vaccine isn‚Äôt useful reported effectiveness. mutated strains going dominate strains US March making J&amp;J almost useless. 200m DOSES. That‚Äôs 100m people wasted. ‚Äúlost‚Äù. 73.6% Americans adults Except need improve distribution need -70. reason import Pfizer vaccine EU since production site Belgium. US produced vaccine could exported Canada example. Would make sense geographical standpoint. yeah it‚Äôs mess wealthiest countries get vaccines right now. global effort get it. 400m total doses, 200m trying protect terrorists stormed capitol spurred on. :(  That's ridiculous recommendation like would push even people away. reminds guidelines think UK safe intimate relations someone included masks rolled eyes everyone else read that. Yes, last CDC recommendation saw get vaccinated 90 days covid illness before. reason evidence shows protection least 90 days disease. right, UK signed contract 3 months earlier EU, EU funding conditional upon getting early access. 
The funding specific targetting Covid provided EU. doses argument made EU, many early doses UK EU imports. vaccines sent UK EU. 
None.
Many EU countries higher infection rates, lower vaccination rates UK, due running out.
The EU trying take vaccines UK. vaccines question produced Belgium, last time checked, UK
Sorry, read, 400m doses , 200m  Well objectively second rate compared Moderna Pfizer, mean good. sounds like cope, honestly. Sorry people hate told this, vaccines magic bullet everybody world wants be. disease care tired COVID precautions. Well, let's compare FL's death rate per capita strict lockdown states NY CA. answer question, would think. Since lockdown NEVER happen cannot lockdown grocery stores, take-out, etc. question trade-offs. far best news since vaccine came imo. Even vaccine partially stops spread, still great news Nice South African (and looks like Brazilian variant too) able reinfect 50% people already it. might help herd immunity present common variant, SA BR variants take over, won‚Äôt help much. percent LA vaccinated 2-3 weeks ago? Nah, survive survivorship bias takes over. Truth. even better, 5th grade teacher, kids ages 10-11. guess who's getting forced back rest elementary teachers? üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è specifically made confident vaccine would safe unborn baby? know missed articles discussing browse sub much. already recently covid, would take whichever one could get first. Since already recovered, I'll wait summer get whichever one seems best them. luxury (and even social duty) waiting quite while. 

Holding vaccine point outright stupid immunity is. No, it‚Äôs bad luck. It‚Äôs selective pressure evolve ability resist natural immunity producing variants apparently able also resist vaccine-induced immunity extent.

But you‚Äôre right worry rapidly immunizing people via vaccinations going greatly increase selective pressure lead development variants like ones found Brazil South Africa. It‚Äôs likely coincidence nations significant outbreaks variants emerged. fact Brazilian variant found Manaus, thought one infected cities world. scary imagine happen entire developed world 50% population somehow immune like Manaus thought to.

The good news trials Noravax J&amp;J indicate vaccines still seem prevent severe illness even regions variants common. hope hold true next variants pop existing ones won‚Äôt diverge ancestors vaccines get closer useless them. Good bot work rules adhered too, problem many people think control. Yet go work day, get paid local currency, money banks, mortgage etc etc etc......don't realise already controlled. Ah, username checks out. agree Biden administration aim higher remember last administration consistently promised delivered. think Biden trying restore faith government he‚Äôs setting goals. Less actually. trying say? language barrier key issue well Let's face it, cases 'long Covid' there, also lot people basically describing effects year-long house arrest. anyone seen goal posts? flying Pluto last saw much dissimilar attitude say 85 years old dying societal levels small problem relative economic damage. It‚Äôs shit evidence based studies specifically designed biased favor author‚Äôs agenda, cherry picked serve op‚Äôs agenda.  Yep kills 1%... left April heat. data seems support conclusion. this: looks like much relationship strict restrictions state many covid deaths per capita had. Give media break. Trump out. pandemic ends, ad revenue fall DRASTICALLY. 5G reception went 2 bars 4. awesome.  Lightfoot really think win fight win CTU? data soon SA understand variants reduce effectiveness vaccine terms developing COVID-19 still shown reduce effectiveness terms development severe disease and/or hospitalization. Watch space. Import vaccines India. mink industry banned this. happy drive across state lines get mine to. Exactly.. lemonade lemon good job. question stands. efficiency border closures great proponents wish paint it. point last year even knew closing borders, virus already present large part world, including Europe US. Currently, imported cases drop water places. point closing borders strategy local eradication. Great, stopped influx thousand cases, meanwhile million people got infected locally. Every measure needs measured impact vs. efectivness. lot people want pretend impact closed borders nothing, affect personally. people means lost jobs, lost access healthcare, family, including elderly children need care means outright homelessness. people marginal gain alright, human sacrifice. First get tracing testing order, actually force every office rat work home talk closing borders adequate. Every time see can‚Äôt seem find number means new people vaccinated per day total shots including 2nd doses  Typo lol. W right next 2 herd immunity yet: pandemic taught us American Society, business owners extroverts gladly sacrifice children marginalized groups profit margins ‚Äúnormal social lives‚Äù without apology. Okay I'm driving car people I'm wondering need open window not. Yeah busses big enough door opens enough let air circulate. I'm stuck people car hour usually small space masks always keep windows open least bit sucks winter cold. are. go, I'm coming playing field. No, asshole, mixed classrooms that‚Äôs making impossible plan. saying would much prefer entirely remote actually manage class. Probably, travel edonistic. don‚Äôt see logic that. 20-50 year olds far likely exposed virus. Wouldn‚Äôt want higher rate protection infection populations likely exposed. think leave people decide they‚Äôre comfortable taking. continue social distancing, masking, traveling/attending events/seeing people

Aside international travel, think that. Read article. comment.

There needs brutal ridicule mockery redditors continue comment reading article. Seems info variants running rampant CA time, likely reason cases exploding. Sure, pandemic fatigue happening everywhere, don‚Äôt think CA‚Äôs surge much blame. Isn‚Äôt Johnson Johnson vaccine around 60% efficacy? Also fare variants floating around right now? honest, really hard understand someone speaking within mask, think joking you. actually forgot Good News flair existed. 

Good news! things work fudge numbers? solid leadership country, could engaged actually fighting virus could turned head.  

 felt awful really nothing active help fight (I'm engineer) early on. medical people family asking mask testing.. area, employer pivot sort thing.  
 feel sort blah.  

Really feel like done early draft everybody country.. ""you're part anti-virus army,"" job, like regular army does, sit around nothing. get paid feds this.  Food medicine rationed distributed.  Everybody could've felt part group, team, society working common enemy.  absolutely nothing like this. Basically surrendered virus federal level let states fight resources. recently heard producing vaccines. actually sure they've exported yet. may well have, I'm aware it. Even probably tiny comparison, since read starting mass production due difficulties. Israel 52.2 doses administered per 100 people moment. Great job, Israel! Corruption action. Chinese really screwed rest world reporting full extent virus. need enough somewhat intelligent Americans take them? think guys strike. Essential workers treated terribly, especially healthcare workers. You‚Äôre effectively laid cannon fodder without proper PPE left deal people don‚Äôt follow distancing rules mask mandates. It‚Äôs disgusting. someone dealing anxiety disorder pandemic, PTSD, isolation due medical issue, terrifies many people dealing this. took years functional A/D/PTSD able work, maintain medication/excercize/therapy balance, able socialize without social anxiety bad want all. miscariage knocked social routine took months recover. coffee one friend months crying home trying make day, POW, pandemic. 

Not everyone rockstar partner/family support. everyone recognizes importance staying sober A/D PTSD flaring up. everyone opportunity motivation prioritize eating well excercize.

This something that's going magically clear reopen either. People may able jump back full time work. People may able handle addiction/self medication well. going take years kindness, professional help, support friends family - many dealing issues. There's going lot people feeling guilty able support themselves/their families way used to, hard feeling real feelings burnout kids hanging 24/7 trying ""on"" year without break. 

Having A/D/PTSD huge stigma, hopefully one good thing 33%+ people stigma less. maybe, maybe, people quit telling us ""JuST RelAx"" ""ChEEr uP, BaD"".

It work - real, hard, work get top anxiety depression. tell you, years experience, worth it.  also lockdown?

So thought cases falling everything closed. White folks gotten 
 half year now. There‚Äôs nothing wait for.

You don‚Äôt wait call cases, actually look states process point mutation, tons others aren‚Äôt hence mutation. randomly happens there‚Äôs many points mutate still viable.

God fucking moron. everywhere. amount spread tbe US lack genetic testing Im sure multiple home grown strains. wouldnt surprised Moderna passes Pfizer doses administered US. Send Obama jail killing children Middle East. Among things. Take J&amp;J, eliminate chance going hospital, help docs helped us... get us back normal. Must nice NHS. Signed, Yankee  famines 2nd, 5th 8th grader house? young one go school risk bringing virus (and illnesses home weaken everyone) home unvaccinated older siblings parents? That‚Äôs winning sales pitch.  Fear porn articles influence public opinion, influences public policy. think important thing make people aware media wants scared / anxious / angry promote accurate, less sensationalized information. Yeah, that‚Äôs lurk lot too. I‚Äôm lockdown skeptic, anger negativity subs getting me. Plus, take virus seriously extent. True, person also said India exports vaccines that's referring to. Think people killed socialisation basic human need. Isn‚Äôt end game begin tho Yeah 99.6+% survival rate really going wipe global population Hard work refuse them. Good. Free contraception. Fuck kids don‚Äôt honestly know, suspect we‚Äôll get information soon. told biggest reason refusal right employees pregnant breastfeeding. recently opened work mostly home, still come occasion, ppl slowly making way through. work. said didn‚Äôt.

They rolled midst outbreak done years. said doesn‚Äôt happen.

Time log onto next account, you‚Äôve trashed one. people never waited all, surprise me. followers brigading sub recently Indefinite shutdowns didn‚Äôt work CA terms keeping case counts down. 

If give people many strict rules grow tired quickly pushback. Let's hope not, although real answer question. vaccines stack? Like get J&amp;J (which lower efficacy) get ones later year? would good way push R value 1 cut spread rates.   Cool let essential workers want know didn‚Äôt ramp N95 mask production every American could like 100 masks. It‚Äôs year, crazy request?  really? Weird, it‚Äôs almost like cutting people leisure social activities almost year definite endpoint sight isn‚Äôt sustainable real world  Well bad don‚Äôt think entire district would adapted 5 years ago mention it‚Äôs one best public school systems country. clearly kid sit front computer working isn‚Äôt negative trying make sound. It‚Äôs factual reported people know know vaccine roll out.

But please tell us DoD tasked try maintain 1.5m shots day private sector own, I‚Äôm sure federal government would ears.    means he‚Äôs brainwashed instantly dismiss whatever reason sees fit send doses U.K. wonder Russia invaded ass.  1918 mask mandates lasted 2-3 weeks. Serbia well well. Seems trend among certain Eastern European countries. little self righteousness early afternoon. Must Saturday. Everything we've seen two vaccines far similar effectiveness protection.

I've watching Pfizer results Israel closely people close received Moderna vaccine, think correct assume results similar.  really think CDC urge people begin wearing masks home.

They want that. neither 99.99% Americans.

All would continue sink goodwill CDC might left American public. guess point vaccine efficacy normally measured many cases vaccine prevented (cases control group vs. vaccinated group) doesn‚Äôt seem 1% article measuring. make sense? yesterday reverse incorrect advice vaccinate pregnant women. advice lasted 24 hours best. come anyone surprise Israel, UK US leading vaccination? basically three bullies world!  Media. Might something SA variant  No, can't anything. gotta live you, entirely futile. Crank ventilation 11. Ireland involved somehow.  Tuberculosis killed 454,000 Africans last year, 93,000 CHILDREN (89,000 reported covid deaths).

I gonna comment post Africa place still polio. [But turns not, actually free wild places endemic-level wild ""vaccine-derived"" Afghanistan Pakistan. Holy crap like whaaat... eyes! I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre dealing this. fellow migraineur (fun word doctor loves use) feel pain. received vaccine yet sure (24 years old, already covid) say personally covid myself, basically 0 symptoms aside really strong, stabby atypical migraines. Meds work. also find whenever get flu shot get severe migraine. 

Anyway, many migraines since first dose long span doses? interesting finally proven true, must arrested genocide soon sets foot foreign country. bit difficult sign contract AstraZeneca even submitted vaccine regulatory consideration.
""While U.K.‚Äôs decision use vaccine significant, Cowling, HKU epidemiologist, says countries may wait begin administering European Medical Authority (EMA) U.S. Food Drug Administration (FDA) grant authorization‚Äîboth seen stringent British regulator.

One EMA official yesterday told Belgian newspaper Het Nieuwsblad AstraZeneca even submitted vaccine regulatory consideration yet, adding approval January wasn‚Äôt likely.""

You right vaccine development doesnt come guarantees, contracts different ""Pakistan secured 17 million doses AstraZeneca‚Äôs COVID-19 vaccine""

Maybe call VISA see there's anything do? Imagine far Trump's ass say help Biden admin Haven‚Äôt following closely, US states still much doses reserve way around? Keep ratcheting hysteria.
Besides fundamentally wrong. Americans sit front computer work. Older vaccine obsolete, still provide protection. Maybe resubmit sensible title, gibberish get us all. That‚Äôs clusterfuck can‚Äôt seem get sorted Yes don‚Äôt address ‚Äúwhat if‚Äôs‚Äù set trouble failure long run. focused ‚Äúwhat if‚Äôs‚Äù first Covid came around wouldn‚Äôt even conversation right likely could prevented hundreds thousands deaths. 

In fact, it‚Äôs people like sitting mess fail understand importance considering ‚Äúwhat if‚Äôs‚Äù situation. 

You would rather choose ignore ability possibly prevent massive situation future simply can‚Äôt see issue today. yet gladly complain massive situation arrives door ask one anything prevent happening. I‚Äôd go 40%. spit balling   Even antivax communities, receive vaccine still vulnerable? seems like never going get rid world wide? gold give would yours. Especially China. hate entertain people want stir bullshit...well done though. I'm middle aged healthy, definition young seems anyone 65.   2 weeks dose think. first gets whatever, 60-80%, gets 94.1% whatever is. Ok need produce administer 2.2 mil per day. Feasible guess, that‚Äôd almost doubling current rates. Madeira also Portugal. Reading title seems another country.  literally already look funding COVAX.

I understand argument, wealthy countries complete disarray right now, supposed help anyone get working again. I‚Äôm Jamaican descent Latinos Arabs blacks sentiment want see white folks get first fine get it. 
My grandmother refuses get saw news folks died getting even though millions gotten fine. 
My grandfather hand ready get doesn‚Äôt know go waiting call 
Idk he‚Äôs waiting I‚Äôm going help  vaccine takes weeks kick it‚Äôs going 100% effective. better Well, darn, too! ü§£ü§£ü§£ made appointment second still seeking info. share find something solid!  that, actually don‚Äôt keep immortality leave temple, it‚Äôs power inside building. even Nazis gotten grail, wouldn‚Äôt worked. awful thing say. Ah, yes dreaded buttcheek itch. I'm good that! Serious complications less likely get sick first place.

The J&amp;J vaccine probably best part population least-likely get sick serious complications begin with.

If risk, pre-existing conditions, 65, Moderna Pfizer vaccines probably appropriate.  now? almost feels like everything back normal. Friends family members passed away. Pretty much everyone know gotten it. numbers decreasing, imo, looks like herd immunity.

Disturbing statement though - fact acknowledged friends family members passed away. 

My ideal vision ""returning normal"" includes loved ones, friends family still alive. OJ role model double murderers get vaccinated. one ‚Äòessential‚Äô unless you‚Äôre conscripted (military). Essential catch bullshit term says ‚Äúboy hope don‚Äôt organize hold employers foot fire shit gets rough‚Äù. one forced work one forced die someone‚Äôs kid matter context it‚Äôs in.  Schools reopening society depends schools, children can't spread Covid. Dude... takes two weeks second shot build immunity. got second dose January 20. tested positive January 29 - 9 days later, 14 more. ‚Äúscience‚Äù backing push reopen schools without controlling epidemic bullshit. nypost.com may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage, post automatically removed. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

Thank helping us keep information /r/Coronavirus reliable!


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  Congrats. right, talking different specifics. So, affect Honduran Guatemalan living LA? go AMLOs rallies? follow health advice? think that‚Äôs easily explained, right? Women make half health care workers 80% long term care residents seems fairly intuitive they‚Äôll vaccinated given vaccine guidelines ty. couple things got state/county included pets 'isolate from' list, *have* heard animals getting it, wanted double check. 
Granted, *was* major issue, we'd've heard now. thought Covid 19 bad heart. /s   lots reporting focused getting enough vaccine doses Americans. I‚Äôm curious many actually get used though. There‚Äôs significant degree anti-vax/vaccine hesitancy US. closely tracked administered doses think could reasonably extrapolate unused doses widely available population. Obviously would ballpark figure high variability. They‚Äôll probably asked leave bus/subway/train. debate restrictions rage rest lives. lot people argue high death counts indicate help hit mental health worth it, lot people also argue restrictions harsher mental health hit worth it.

And unfortunately lot people recognize gonna come opinions. value life vulnerable elderly livelihoods young healthy objective ethical question. complicated, I'm positive people going maintain side they've chosen founded nothing reason fact. sad instance different opinions valid decision needs made collectively. tough.  Highly possible esp American antinvax communities. got rid whooping cough measles come back every often. Luckily though, contained smaller pockets. Hopefully. It‚Äôs quite flawed theory, since a) Latinos Mexican-American, b) president Mexico doesn‚Äôt set US health policy. Fuck Ron DeathSentence third world countries get mrna vaccines? screwed? plenty essential employees working everyday person. Teachers group highlighted deemed unable states work person. one essential employees. refusing go work. fear everyday might catch Covid. choice though give fear stay holed house go make sure people need get support need. get support homeless even worse off. choose continue support them. 

This pandemic hard everyone discount mental effects everyone. Children though weakest link need education.   CDL Hybrid teaching horrible. teachers also putting way hours ever class. teaching beach, rare. kids get educated properly get left behind. virus already extremely high survival rate. vaccines getting distributed although slowly. time come make excuses return classroom.  Here's latest case/death charts California, running 7-day currently ranks 37th total per capita reason concerned. Exactly - people thread stupid giving poor advice. type dont believe masks. catching vaccine, assume could spread asymptomatically think friends, family neighbors upvoted comment way. care get downvoted, least posts demonstrate rational concern people's health lives.  Kind like Cheney Congress, sometimes speak what's right what's popular, despite cost.

Case point - least get sightseeing trip.  Right? There's huge, awesome music festival that's held there. rather was. actually pretty much last major music festival happen lockdowns. suit also name certain former president state run yet? even path run out? Also interstate travel. pass goddamn relief states shut quash outbreaks Fuck Johnson Johnson. never ever trust them. Idk much companies us people stop supporting them. Unethical fuck they‚Äôre still going strong Here's latest case/death charts (as yesterday) California, running 7-day rates still elevated, cases indeed way down.

Overall California 98.93 deaths per 100k population. ranks 37th US per capita never Zero-COVID point needing tweak vaccines boosters regularly. Hey, nice boss.  Brainwashed? Let‚Äôs see, paper is:

- peer reviewed.
- published journal, much less well-respected one.
- uses colorful, overconfident language supported science title (‚Äúproves beyond reasonable doubt!‚Äù) even though it‚Äôs Bayesian analysis.
- doesn‚Äôt acknowledge limitations Bayesian analysis (at least priors, someone else pointed out, off, throws entire analysis balance).
- guy paid article deceptively published AP (money talks, right).

It‚Äôs funny call brainwashed discerning judgment paper. red flags place. literally paper sheeple. Sheeple want believe specific conclusion show discernment information consume long tells want hear. That‚Äôs you, sheeple. Highlights needs vaccines can't fix stupid Never heard El Salvador, Nicaragua, Panam√°, Honduras, Guatemala, Per√∫, Argentina, Bolivia, Ecuador, etc? Pretty sure Latinos DGAF president Mexico doesn‚Äôt do. read something day explaining vaccine prevent infection, illness.  think incorrect, or, maybe trying explain could still virus carrier vaccination.  Everything else I've read seems assume vaccine prevent people testing positive.   covid19 withstand uv c light, we're screwd. 1905 uv germicidal lights first used.  drinking karaoke night.  Zero-COVID goal, way get constantly tweaked vaccine boosters: I‚Äôm frankly pissed damn disease would willing spend silly amount money eliminate planet never think again. 6 month old study newer research contradicts definition, cannot case without knowing it. infection without knowing don‚Äôt disagree you. think we‚Äôd save lives forcing vaccinations focusing education, community support, fostering trust think forcing even hospital staff get vaccine could jeopardize that. know, lot people like bread. Can't beat good rye bread read reports tho...Johnson&amp;Johnsons vaccine like 65% efffective covid. That's closer 50/50 I'd like...  think also due expected holiday peak - lots indoor gatherings, etc. Cases spiked, really nowhere go down. really sucks. can't find vaccine Missouri. know WTF going vaccines. Terribly frustrating. uh...how concerned cats? tested positive, probably late try board anywhere anyone could theoretically take them? According Table 3 risk infected spouse around 30%, though studies say closer 50%-60%. minimal cases June/July/August??????? Wow, missed chance. would Australia/NewZealand-fuck Boris whats-his-name! would expecting Spring resurgence Covid cases Dakotas? bet would essentially vanished April. 

The 7-day moving daily average N Dakota 130 now. 90+% peak. bet daily cases May? may true surely sample size small can't certain it. 0 vaccinated volunteers ended hospital, say vaccine prevented hospitalization 100% time point would technically correct, nessecarily true. great news. rarely use word - deserve - &amp; every hands employee healthcare truly deserves assist vaccinations provide. pandemic controlled much lives, endure onslaughts covid hospitalizations deaths. Glad see light end tunnel. know. Bad situation. kind told reddit twitter ""experts"" don't. study obviously wrong. scared China's military US military larger, destructive, many links private industries world? mean, testing people age 12 (which underway) we‚Äôll try 9 year olds. It‚Äôs going take awhile. Classy bottom, trashy top.

Referring suit improper mask. Big pitfall releasing criminals prison since didn‚Äôt want ‚Äúto get sick‚Äù.  Police significant amount population think it‚Äôs ludicrous enforce laws virus let people prison it.    Anxious quite general term though? Absolutely. Apparently 1 3 people LA JJ 66% effective one shot supposed lessen extreme effects COVID patients.

Yearly flu shot 40% effective think UK given many second jabs yet either? Headlines days AI optimized clicks. Honesty factor. use odd language ‚Äú6-fold decrease?‚Äù Non specialists need translated efficacy. no/technical English ‚Äú6-fold‚Äù usually used mean increase, decrease?

Does 6- fold mean 60% fewer antibody reaction blood vaccinated people? What‚Äôs normal gonna over? gonna psychological, business social effects years. So, want experts give exact number cases make going back normal okay? countries requirement attend school. point even, Johnson Johnson approved ten million doses I'd still say go 18-35 age range since older folks would better waiting weeks moderna supplies catch up. tricky decision would people 50-60, since need good one also first line Better nothing told can‚Äôt that. Like I‚Äôm tied Moderna least 6 months keep getting mixed information Flu rates plummeted lack international travel measures. one gonna flu. It‚Äôs risk everyone willingly lives like covid eventually. Sure healthcare disparity obesity, absolutely. Though part may cultural related diet, large part also due economic privilege disparity, fact healthy diet often expensive related societal privilege, access preventative healthcare information, etc.

As said above, MANY societal inequities contributing COVID healthcare disparities among Latino community. Increased likelihood essential labor jobs cannot completed home. Decreased access health insurance affordable/early/preventative healthcare. Less likelihood receiving appropriate equitable care seek medical care. Less access public assistance would allow leave unsafe working conditions. Limited access vaccines neighborhoods. go on. 

I work healthcare field Latino populations, saying mortality disparity Latinos ‚Äúobese‚Äù completely misses social inequities underlying disparity blames Latinos disadvantages social inequities created. statistics/numbers sense, we‚Äôre likely take things seriously see effects personal lives. It‚Äôs lot harder downplay Covid someone know suffered able hear firsthand. Anecdotes help cement reality. know appear another person yelling internet, friend part very, very, very, small percentage people long-haul-Covid symptoms, doesn‚Äôt mean doesn‚Äôt exist. assessment incorrect. happened Sputnik vaccination program? Moscow mayor admits half city population infected. numbers reflect reality. realize much actually lip read covid. I'm constantly saying ""huh?"" ""what?"" get people repeat themselves.

Im hard hearing, guess I'm visual person read lips much listen words. I'm surprised. Last year botch, I'm surprise gonna take longer two years. still might many kicking screaming, defying even littlest things help us get global pandemic. What's dumb able simple math. Ignorant thinking every healthcare worker fired get vaccine regardless personal reasons. think meant call ignorant. 30 percent California covid Wait till hear North Korea Olympics Nice  lost job due COVID relatives currently it. People brink homelessness. effects happening justify return normal business. government paying people stay home, I'm also foolish enough believe USA anytime soon, we're stuck COVID now. could months lockdowns UBI, yet are. Yeah conversation immediately started vaccine distribution announced. extremely suspect. school one stupid policies covid.

So wrestling season, wrestling team, requirement quarantine 15 mins someone mask on. Since wrestling matches usually arent 15 mins, even wrestle kid covid, wearing mask, wrestler doesnt quarantine... like literally sweating eachother, mask doesnt stop spreading... endgame goal otherwise people give ECG / heart scans show? Swelling enlargement? better moving Olympics 2024 Japan still host it. move Paris 2024 Olympics 2028 actually really nuanced article! assume watched 2018 documentary 1918 pandemic, origen, reasons got worse post war, etc

Free YouTube. interesting look science (both biological social) surrounding pandemic without politicization one's made last year. Oh, throw money around get front everyone else life worth richer. least admit it. never said exist, said people think they're suffering aren't. link share speaks heart lung damage would visible x-rays ECGs. lot people believe long COVID turned away doctors treated properly, examinations showing complications. means they've lucky far one died. (car accident otherwise). thing I'm concerned disease long term effects. want short breath rest goddamn life anti-masker chooses go grocery shopping one determine whether something prevents death 100% time? aint afraid ghosts. treated paid holiday? employer reimbursed government? rocket science. know, I'm one going medical consensus here. No, sweetheart, I'm Balkans. people conquered, colonized many quite literally enslaved centuries, problem calling colonizers are. thanks vote literally said 70 55-59 brain couldn‚Äôt even handle minute increase flies face narrative bumped respectively make sound slightly worse. found hilarious. 

We see edited comment, guy lol. hate burst bubble there‚Äôs really way spin 70% effective vaccine variants bad thing supports covid forever mentality. Hell even 55-59% effective one doesn‚Äôt support that.

Do think gonna mutations? think diseases stop mutating vaccine releases? forgotten NYC global epicenter turned control infection around lockdown? one discounting issues COVID. comes point messaging like article becomes hopeless fatalistic people start give up. point taking vaccine restrictions won‚Äôt lifted/if chance variant emerges escapes vaccine? clarify. 85% protection ‚Äúsevere‚Äù symptoms. actually 0 people took vaccine die even go hospital ~100% protection even severe situations. True risk that? Promise 100 achieve 200+ look competent  understand also work hospital you‚Äôd shocked know many front line workers aren‚Äôt vaccinated kept vaccines preventable diseases flu. mention rates smoking. Covid we‚Äôd things I‚Äôm sure would hold legally US least. No. country one colonized people quite literally sold slavery. ok, bad story gone bye-bye. Well, vaccine rollouts preventing death (at least State, cases). 87% deaths 70+ 95% deaths 60+. Kinda FL Gov saying, ""Protect old people, open economy.""

So, far lockdowns, based saying regard case rate, advantage lockdowns. was, CA NY lower case rates per capita FL (significantly?) higher case rates. would also assume FL higher % older people, may anecdotal. vaccines? *Lockdowns, fixed title you. you‚Äôre answers don‚Äôt make sense wrong  Saying something ""100% effective"" based 5 cases PR stunt, science. except dont want J&amp;J one. vaccines reduced efficacy far still proven work South African strain likely work strain Brazil since two mutations similar. judge Clearly you‚Äôre searching wrong things. things able find specifically looking comparisons long-COVID beginning learn long-term symptoms COVID. understand wanting pretend like isn‚Äôt issue, understand wanting change mind, evidence increasingly pointing long-COVID symptoms genuine effect COVID-19. said something brain gymnastics something AZ overpromised underdelivered somehow thought good idea pick side. happen next return negotiating table sides get things sorted out. result everyone get less, cannot sell have.

Bolsonaro part neofascist, evangelical, FSB propped network racist assholes fucking Western governments ever since Putin band thieves told fuck markets western governments happened Crimea. 

Thugs like Trump Bolsonaro know virus affecting people color happily propagating disinformation means expedite dreams white ethno state. Well things degrees course. people think normal life think 'can go house party? club? office?' 'can travel Peru without quarantining?' That's 1/2 horse. guess which. impression vaccines allow us resume lives normal, ignoring rise mutations sake convenience. mean need 70% herd immunity I'd say we're pretty darn close combined amount people who've covid, tested not.. don‚Äôt worry... here? spare? Asking EU friend. Can't kids Covid kills though question dual citizen living Europe is...Could able fly states get vaccine? lived Europe entire life, American citizenship. would steps get vaccine stateside?

I mean, file taxes US, might well profit right? Clearly met toddler. didn‚Äôt prove response wrong all. downvoted facts. Vaccine elderly there, open freaking countries get back normal life! COMPLETELY misread headline ‚ÄúCOVID vaccines slowly spreading virus‚Äù like ‚Äúummmm no?‚Äù Right inauguration, fancy that. also seem forgetting new vaccines far proven effective new strains chances mutation rendering vaccine completely useless extremely unlikely near future.

This objectively untrue. UK variant shown handled vaccines well, South African Brazilian variants ones raising alarms, along many mutations come time. We'd probably focus building much bigger, permanent hospital infrastructure recruiting staff. human race would live significant portion population falling prey virus time going mega hospitals. You‚Äôre argument could made taxi driver, grocery store worker, retail employee, massage therapist, dentist... Etc, etc.. They‚Äôre potentially risking lives customers refusing get vaccinated. propose re-assigned non-public facing positions?

Look, I‚Äôm HCW.. work LTC.. also opted getting Pfizer shot SOON able (frankly would‚Äôve gotten 6 months ago opposed 10 days ago). I‚Äôm fully wholeheartedly vaccination every single person medically able receive it. mind, I‚Äôve done due diligence trying correct co-workers misunderstandings mountains research backing smart decision (with caveat least ask doctor).

But said, it‚Äôs isn‚Äôt mandatory, forcing people going result conspiracy theories, pushback non-compliance.

My facility 209 beds.. That‚Äôs 209 residents/patients, 2 designated caregivers (family members) allowed in, roughly 400 staff. Approximately 1,027 people. 1,027, 412 people chose get vaccinated (their first shot). 40% compliance.. really think method going change that? Soft gate. Based 5 people. exactly statistically significant. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.


*I bot, action performed automatically.

Hopefully trial people end story.  2 3 straight wrong 4 doesn‚Äôt even make sense Spanish flu too. really wanto get debate whether life go back normal summer whatever, 

A debate implies sides valid opinions. opinion, experts telling us *will* persist spring summer. night clubs, likely come free unrestricted travel Ethiopia.

You realize vaccines showing useful new strains, correct? also still able spread without getting necessarily getting sick yourself. people ITT eager go back brunch say go see happens.

 I'm 21 still never able go bar COVID. Yeah, kinda sucks, also incredibly petulant pretend like desire go ""back normal"" outweighs scientific fact COVID stay. One 'long Covid' symptoms listed study 'anxiety'.

This hardly polio. mean sure paranoid discounting paranoia calling stupid telling shouldn‚Äôt allowed go public going change mind. don‚Äôt vaccine shouldn‚Äôt start now. vaccine already showing reduced transmission small population vaccinated. There‚Äôs millions people waiting shots. see rate drop low enough we‚Äôll deal like flu.  cannot mandate vaccine ‚ÄúEmergency Use Authorization‚Äù.  It‚Äôs fully FDA approved yet. Pfizer actually delivering ahead schedule. changed packaging read 6 doses per vial instead 5 magically say shipping 120 million doses US Q1 instead 100 million. rail media.

Don't put air quotes around expert can't bothered read article.

Your first comment NOTHING clickbait headlines, shat thought expert saying. Perhaps that's everybody means, article defines ""not normal"" travel restrictions. stop. know this, he‚Äôs 80 Jamaica doesn‚Äôt know I‚Äôm going take Publix get Herd immunity must kicking too. Anyone hates bastardized science become? agreeing popular study instead critical everything making sure everything valid. LOL. God, guys absolutely terrible. It‚Äôs produced German company. German company funded German tax money. typical, logical. Frankly nothing, fearmongering finest can‚Äôt figure person kids breakfast, lunch snack room submit breakfast/snack/lunch numbers. Zoom remote students refuse come, give information/work hot spots kids remote sick temporarily remote. update lists day. 

Friday 1 kid came late, 2 called quarantine, 1 computer issue come get fixed. sex offender zoom told last 2 hours cover another class mine would hang cafeteria lunch monitor short subs. Every time move kids move logs next need updated.

Then phone time parents upset kid absent zoom ran hotspot internet. 

When we‚Äôre remote teach record see anything later. don‚Äôt time stamp every bathroom break log sneeze send nurse... write mask break times sat next leave classroom ‚Äúsanitized‚Äù. teach plan next day. Right we‚Äôre person everything work home 3 weeks ready moment. usually find 10am leave school 11am 9pm day closing. 

We‚Äôve remote person due constant cases kids teachers. normal year I‚Äôm good job need consistency clear plan anything. 

Imagine going work every day idea day look like, you‚Äôre going working from, you‚Äôre responsible for, need do. lock people dying cancer, families. businesses still closed gone forever. Certainly nothing aspire to.

New zealand beautiful country ugly society. Latinos statistically much likely overweight/obese, high amount body fat longterm metabolic issues far biggest risk developing severe case COVID dying.

Mexico twice percentage obese people death rate matches almost perfectly. guess mean basically point another everyone world severe symptoms?

Still better current high risk people maybe still get severe symptoms?

They still less without vaccine hospitals full treat long-term symptoms know prevented vaccine?

They would still without vaccine

TL;DR: issues vaccine could cause, even mostly irrational fear, would still far better ones already without left, he‚Äôs back Mar-a-lago. 66% fine?!? Yep, I'd actually prefer one Well, seeing didn't, doesn't, won't...?

Almost like locking society protect relatively small group ultimately counterproductive damage. Well know much lol Plus like four years start Kansas. Like I've strong adamantly protesting anyone wear mask. come man good news better take feel like we're close getting hump Oh god, light end tunnel? *happiness noise* First all, want say I'm really glad company capabilities place work home - great.

With said, problem WFH. problem line work life blurred. amount work increased nothing work. Personally, think I'd enjoy WFH lot could finish work, go gym, dinner friends, go see movie, normal outside things. would really great. media site spread fear.

If country would around 90 deaths per million. long time 100. Hospital occupancy 88 percent vs normally 103 percent there. 110 people die day non covid year, 30 cancer vs 5 10 day covid. 

Yet certainly info one hears.

There need restrictions stats fine. get point fall lockdowns going far outweigh immediate consequences pandemic simply sustainable long run. comparison Spanish flu horrible comparison since vaccines advanced medical expertise combat new strains. also seem forgetting new vaccines far proven effective new strains chances mutation rendering vaccine completely useless extremely unlikely near future. Zero-COVID goal

No realistic SMART goal must realistic goal realistically achieved given available resources time. UK vaccinating people fast? thought supply issues. Larger population,more reinfections, less immunity, viral variation, severe permanent damage studies? [There‚Äôs even evidence getting vaccine means can‚Äôt asymptomatic wish was, I‚Äôd love able stop wearing mask every patient contact. 

While everyone able take vaccine soon can, caregivers refuse danger patients entire pandemic. there‚Äôs evidence yet they‚Äôre likely spread virus asymptomatic vaccinated colleagues. Proper PPE sanitary procedures still best way protect patients. get technical, actually considered OK charity work Sundays I'm sure giving vaccinations would qualify. Chick-fil-A opened Sunday many times natural disasters strike feed affected. Meanwhile, get emails hospital sometimes go to, say vaccine supply remains low. don‚Äôt require vaccine, deadly diseases contagious. would never work. vaccine 1918 knowledge, like say flu There's school districts saying go back in-person kids vaccinated. Fairfax, Virginia, recall China sequenced SARS2 Genome month. its.... late.

UK Sequenced new variant 3 months. its... world leader.

Yeah, WSJ. Whatever poV selling, hardly convincing. What‚Äôs current plan, don‚Äôt mind asking? 5 billion years now: ""The impending death sun silver bullet end COVID-19 pandemic"" all, nurse (hopefully) saying much less patients good news (if true) not? one peddling false information even admit proven wrong. said never problems vaccines evidently false.

You damage good unreasonable rational precautions.   Let‚Äôs it. light fire someone? Hoboken NJ easily best news I've heard virus. asthma edge fuckin months. Respect consistency listening experts? people like prolonged shit year more. nice. You‚Äôre saying things like it‚Äôs bad thing. Australian we‚Äôre fussed wear masks go lockdown need to. really high compliance rates both. idea. think filled early people signing ton people ahead me. Yeah thing vaccine keep resort lockdowns eventually people say fuck cases come all. 

This last lockdown, economy society can't survive another. people find damage we're greater lives saved. critical mass non compliance whole thing crumbles down.  Thank providing source Fold 6x +\- case described. Sometimes shape nose. partner tight-fitting masks even somehow drops every minutes walking mine never does. That's exactly works.

If 1/100 people get severe symptoms normally, receiving vaccine 1/666 get severe symptoms, reduced severe symptoms 85%. news articles picture always somebody doesnt fucking wear mask correctly got it, really make sense I'm obviously pro-COVID. said variants ‚Äúspreading‚Äù ‚Äúemerging‚Äù. immunity low population resistant strain may end dying many Covid strains do, high much likely spread rapidly overtake existing variants. matters something scientists concerned even it‚Äôs reason shouldn‚Äôt vaccinate people. too, first dose complete test whole staff new cases! First time since October! Things like enraging. 

It took months even recognize long haulers. going take years recognize tests fucking meaningless 50% population.

The tests miss 20% infections they're applied OPTIMALLY. practice miss much much higher

A lot people perfect sense smell minimal respiratory symptoms, feel like they're verge death. HM, BETTER NASAL SWAB, VIRUS WOULD DEFINITELY THERE, RIGHT???? Last time checked world population live island frequent travel neighboring countries it‚Äôs impossible countries US even replicate something like Australia New Zealand think they're even giving people contracted covid within last 90 days. what's point getting anyway already it? don‚Äôt think followers ‚Äúbrigading sub.‚Äù

Looks like would know. Sounds like standard govt supply pipeline me. Everyone hurting right countless different ways. I‚Äôm normally one pain olympics, think it‚Äôs different ballgame many kids. Children years ahead rest us, also stand far lose long-term impacts society long. can‚Äôt take gap year child development. bad day something? seem combative replies. I'm gonna call bs. Sorry rock could POTUS still would best vaccine procurement, want know why? america lol, literal wealthy prosperous nation healthcare system work already vaccinated 5,900+ employees, providers vendors roughly 8,000 person workforce. remaining ones either don‚Äôt want waiting see others fare vaccines first they‚Äôre permitted get vaccine due recovered COVID. weeks ago almost 500 employees COVID quarantining due exposure day ago number 100. COVID patients went 400 worst 285 yesterday includes patients recovered COVID still sick get discharged. yes, vaccines really work opinion. True, see lot too.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Okay, misunderstood. Yes, vaccine 95% effective, last 5% get infected. cases probably transmit well, even though link anything even that.

But question whether 95% get ill vaccine could spread. remains unconfirmed scientists, nothing link. talking about? go work. get sense well. mega-companies/monopolies thriving, socially inept people love staying locked (no offense!), media outlets always new terror push faces politicians love good disaster - virus godsend. many, want give pandemic either - EVIL hold point view... Went Covid test CVS drive through. swabbed nose realized little bit blood swab. Could contaminate results? world learn difference between‚Äùinfection‚Äù ‚Äúdisease.‚Äù like vocabulary we‚Äôve learned past year. That's fantastic.

My friend's father died last week Covid spread nursing home. close. :( disagree you, that's mainly America kinda sucks.  imagine start happening vaccines fully approved... think tendency forget still special status. research indicates asymptomatic people large contributors spread. Pre-symptomatic people different story. mean I've months, maybe people getting sick moving objectives ""the vaccine matter"" narrative. mood changed gone negative controversial time positive controversial. guess that's progress?

The sub's call followers 50,000, 2,000,000 member sub.... Aw, thank this, that's kind say. hope nice weekend :) country lockdowns eased reached X number cases X days. gave everyone goal motivated right thing cos better complied, earlier out. based proper science. don‚Äôt hear complaining US export ban? suffered casualties 90% countries world

We've reported* more

I'm sure Sweden would drop least 10 positions death toll ""rankings"" massive underreporting going world, especially impoverished countries Mulaney reference, anyone familiar: think news 2 functions: accurately report status quo, focus attention things improve.

I agree reporting hiccups let us see good happening, also, saying 1.1M-1.2M per day going show improve. 

We need world. personally find odd changed recommendation despite simultaneous admission ""[very little data available assess vaccine safety That's true far know. Organ impairment appears significantly common hospitalization among low-risk people long covid.

From [this April September 2020, 201 individuals (mean age 44 (SD 11.0) years, 70% female, 87% white, 31% healthcare workers) completed assessments following SARS-CoV-2 infection (median 140, IQR 105-160 days initial symptoms). prevalence pre-existing conditions (obesity: 20%, hypertension: 6%; diabetes: 2%; heart disease: 4%) low, **only 18% individuals hospitalised young, low-risk population ongoing symptoms, **almost 70% individuals impairment one organs four months initial symptoms SARS-CoV-2 infection**. implications burden long COVID also public health approaches assumed low risk young people comorbidities.

[Another looked frequency long COVID, found 2.3% people COVID19 infections still experiencing symptoms 12 weeks.

If numbers even close accurate, many hundreds thousands people US among never got hospitalized detectable organ damage several months initial infection.

Importantly, studies even looking central nervous system developed numbers. know mechanisms known neurological damage that's occurring, much less frequency occurs. 

We know, however, virus directly infect Central Nervous System. know loss smell common. know loss smell often last long time, indicating significant damage nerves. know nerves form direct pathway brain.

Everyone focused impacts respiratory system and/or circulatory system, nobody looking brain. US actively avoiding use things like MRIs infected patients due risk spreading disease.

**TL;DR** Based available data, number people moderate cases experiencing organ impairment surprisingly high without even attempting look impacts nervous system. Given know disease, seems like lack information regarding frequency nervous system involvement major blind spot understanding disease. better vaccines new strains really soon then. current vaccines already useless, switching vaccines new strains right now. Yeah, 50/50 J&amp;J vaccine?  so... don‚Äôt get point all. box tells surgical mask useless. convinced yet, seems concrete mask guidance rn. say cloth masks good, others say either n95/kn95 2 masks needed.

People host indoor parties fun. articles coming far access vaccinations late spring/early summer. close, despite doom gloom many headlines. life precious lose you‚Äôve made far. light end tunnel here. Please stick around life going get much better soon. Dr. Fascinating stated public buying masks public need wearing them, that's idea truth? you? That's sad. state, CVS Walgreens finished 1st vaccinations nursing homes started second vaccinations. sounds like might problem state level either oversight logistics. Pfizer vaccines EUs, bought paid UK. EU right block vaccines already paid for.

The contract astra zeneca specifically says eu INITIAL doses supplied eu factories. part mentions UK factories concerning doses delivered outside initial doses. EU dithered contract factories EU would issue. AZ issue UK plants 3 months ago, time fix now. 

You obviously hard hating UK, even disagree contract, EU astra zeneca. sure harping UKs fault Romania vaccinate elderly first? That's interesting. I'd say bad idea. LMFAO.  


no wait, LMFAO.

&amp;#x200B;

LOL, NO. bit context:

Greek primary schools (Athens) nurseries open since January. Since January also steady increase cases. Stores opened 2 weeks ago closing allow secondary schools open. Greek specialists still insist low chance transmission schools. prime minister promised test large samples school age children random opening educational institutions never bothered spoken proposal since. top vaccines low little chance Europe summer even close. Remember excuse made lack organizational skills ELECTED officials. wasn‚Äôt thing before?
Jesus, America black community horribly misrepresented entertainment. think 5 alive famous black people, whereas could easily list 20+ alive famous white people. Tyler Perry almost ubiquitous love amongst black community. johnson Johnson 1 shot 2? Numbers numbers Though. go positive, smaller, hobby subs. think options: Currently, one allowed house 8pm live. That's one big shift Bundesrepublik, always valued keep freedom.

That's easy contagiousness tests need every grocery store checkout, every company, school, care home. far away. delivering 200m, 400m doses dumb recommendation. like CDC maybe UK issued recommendations safe intimacy someone. rolled eyes.  take look it, does. There's 2-3 week lag it, yeah, looks like adds Pfizer 90% rate? 72 good? does. said Russia China. right. but- LOT us already anxious depressed covid ever showed up. Probably covid around forever. might need periodic booster shots it, like flu. But, mutates slower flu booster shots effective needed less frequently. 

Also, immunity variant covid provides significant degree protection variants (for example, even immunity SARS 20 years ago provides protection covid). So, population form immunity longer risk hospitals overwhelmed death rate much lower. So, need restrictions. Wrong.
Wrong, wrong, *wrong*.
Shit take. That‚Äôs shit take.

If ‚Äúexpert‚Äù thinks people America Europe continue social distancing, masking, traveling/attending events/seeing people widespread vaccinations people Iran Venezuela aren‚Äôt vaccinated yet, complete fool. needs brutal ridicule mockery people audacity continue suggesting bullshit. That‚Äôs ok. Good J&amp;J already trials 2-shot regimen, can‚Äôt know sure it‚Äôll work better data, wouldn‚Äôt pay trials unless good chance beneficial India? Another article sub says 66% effective preventing moderate severe covid. one it? Thank captain obvious. teachers shown true colors don‚Äôt care experts say. given benefit working home hindsight never happened everything keep remote learning. absolutely nothing anyone could say would good enough teachers agree return schools tomorrow including finding way eradicate covid tomorrow goes exactly point. made stricter rules disallowed lot traveling taking place. people wanted travel unnecessary pandemic allowed buy ticket get plane/train/etc. 25% staff decline vaccine really unable vaccinate quarter staff works every day hospital. Either answer question fucking ridiculous. common cold. little understanding people's brains injured disease, much less understanding much existing vaccines prevent damage.

Yet 100s diseases data lockdown for. I'm lockdown's protect hospitals. 

I'm going restrict data even confirmed. severe symptoms 99% reduced, believe everything open. every step risk. 

Simply put, can't keep people home forever. year. Protect hospitals, protect economy. Thank God. equine strain Covid-Neighteen brutal. know Chinese South Korean‚Äôs done study last March... think tornado (which damages destroys everything path) Covid (which far, *far* dangerous specific groups like elderly low extremely low risk retirement age, like people working especially attending schools), problem isn‚Äôt understanding.

And I‚Äôm fine giving remote option teachers older identified risk factor teach kids want remote virtual option. schools open kids parents want real school now. secondary damage done kids long gone beyond ‚Äúbenefits‚Äù continued closures. get dropped something? wrong. plain wrong.  Ah yeah. I'm Mass, Charlie Baker basically following Cuomo's lead this. Seemed like barely plan place.   Fibromyalgia chest pain, part. She‚Äôs Johannesburg, way. shouldn‚Äôt talking know entire active duty 68W (combat medic) units preparing deploy least month, administer vaccines throughout country. don‚Äôt think worry enough vaccinators available. might even deploy though. Nothings official yet don‚Äôt take word it.   Yes see correlation know makes angry... 


There vaccines going waste us, people refusing vaccinate ""they research"" dont want microchips implanted. 


And local corrupt government managed buy 12k vaccines whole country, politics businness people health sector got vaccinated. 


While people US might getting millions vacciones, we'll wait probably till 2022 get leftover vaccines..

 
This fucking sucks. clickbait fear mongering. Great- address fact people mild covid dealing long term health problems?! isn‚Äôt part conversation? Yep ,they make junk. Yeah that's basically thought, think surprised since seemed little stronger regular flu shot. Prob law saying it‚Äôs privacy issue. Well rules allow travel vaccinated, particularly care anyone's opinion it.  data studies carried out, FDA want make action available, especially general public. That's way read it, stop short recommendations. Anyway here's study: don‚Äôt start pointing fingers people outright refusing Covid vaccines ever trying get people same? ever problem vaccines? particularly one, understanding modified already well researched vaccine? feel like people base fear vaccines based reality, educated not.  Watch Republican states give permission, blame Democrats.  No, can't go rollerblading need decrease burden hospitals. Fear mongering garbage. I‚Äôm sorry it‚Äôll take time vaccinate third world, zero percent chance rest world hangs around waits them. fun? entire comment amounts remote education doesn‚Äôt work still support point willing abandon actual job person education. ? last week, last checked, small proportion (about 1/7) Israelis received second jab, recently. health officials judged results using one jab disappointing 52% effectiveness Pfizer indicated. significant portion population several weeks beyond second jab (at point effectiveness expected exceed 90%) start seeing declines there, think important question much long articles allowed influence public policy going forward. article 6 months old, date, inaccurate. Here's recent article sets record August, Korean research team caveated conclusions, saying couldn‚Äôt prove whether children study infecting parents, whether parents infecting kids, whether entire households exposed third party. Ah, shit. probably right. basically get around rules go sacred integrity single market- fine ignore suits apparently. think it‚Äôs blankety blank blank blank. would u want go sweaty nightclub? No. Neither UK US this. debt motivating factor. agree, people get choose long rest society held hostage. one discussion recently, someone thought schools open teachers vaccinated, also teachers able choose vaccinate. figured ""all teacher vaccinated"" meant ""all person"", no, thought close school Covid ""gone"".

People right get vaccinated, right prevent rest world returning back normal. sorry us prefer better protection since recognize focusing hospitalization &amp; death means little virus cause long term health problems people never got severe illness. 

I also don‚Äôt much faith j&amp;j, seeing continued selling known toxin baby powder products years. trust brand new vaccine? They‚Äôre clearly willing put people risk get keep product shelf. 

These concerns negate potential value j&amp;j‚Äôs vaccine, people reason concern... isn‚Äôt like we‚Äôre making stuff up. I‚Äôm cool others getting j&amp;j version long get moderna pfizer. concern j&amp;j flood market, making difficult impossible us access one want. Again, reasonable concern. People dismissing concerns denial. Yup. Lack lip reading makes difference. I've struggled hear boyfriend right next handful near meltdowns frustration. can't wait take things off! miss days everyone saying much better EU pandemic response US. vaccinations US appear going unbelievably smoothly compared EU. It‚Äôs cheek me. ""Ask doctor immortality right you."" know, enough die can‚Äôt spread anymore. Point taken. can‚Äôt publications agree public health information ongoing pandemic shouldn‚Äôt hidden behind paywall? said waiting 2022? whole conversation push get kids vaccinated soon could they're still vector disease even everyone else immune, kids make significant portion population. even asymptomatic still spread concern mutation. work variants others minimal mutations, that's able completely kill people get flu shot still get flu. Agreed- data always trusted anecdotes, given there‚Äôs great way prove veracity. thought cool share. mean demographic disparity ""explained"". I'm surprised see articles institutional sexism all. 

Oh wait, I'm surprised. ? idea try say. believe freedom choice too, case freedom choose unemployed. would like worker refusing work computers believe rf emitted causes cancer. It‚Äôs choice so, can‚Äôt fulfill basic requirements job.. New things come light. doubt someone mind sure Chinese shitty behavior. Good thing US rich country, third-world country iPhones! /s Ever buy anything overseas? don‚Äôt think anyone forced take vaccine; however, vaccination required someone wants leave private property. something like hospital staff don‚Äôt want take vaccine, that‚Äôs fine, won‚Äôt permitted work industry anymore. industry. travel public.

Medical exemptions? course they‚Äôre exempt.

Religious exemptions? prove prayers/songs/dancing/statues/whatever provided level immunity vaccine, sure that‚Äôs fine. hasn‚Äôt happened now, seems highly unlikely. used ELEVATOR?? know could THAT! states sure. Oregon got antibody test December place week. said even week hundred people, far nobody tested positive antibodies. + essential workers

+ large multigenerational households want either. knew ass pain cause! I'm convinced. 11% vaccinated, many extra careful begin with.

This could natural end wave. countries experienced sharp ending wave without mass vaccination. Also, Isreal way ahead anybody else terms vaccination, yet middle big 3rd wave.

See exactly fight EU UK, UK anything wrong.

It EU throwing toys pram shouting UK due AZ. news able getting parents appointments next week, I‚Äôm filled happy tears. we've seen pandemic, though, cause serious damage. people trusting good vaccine others reduced risk tolerance something even case prior Covid. ""Looks like shit plan here.""

""God needs sober making plans.""

""Sounds like might need help, creation literally fire.""

""Yeah, he's pretty cruel god. Reminds Sid ants Toy Story."" Yes, t-cell test could show previous infections. tests aren‚Äôt widely available public point, though. selling headlines. Generally fear sells good news. things read antibody tests reliable, really matter ever 100% sure ever it. reports people long term ""damage"" even asymptomatic infections, suppose possible people run issue road could assumed Covid. time really tell. 

The main thing everybody would get vaccine regardless. know Covid, think might it, believe never it. Get vaccine either way. favorite sandwich condiment? hope choice.  would choose get Moderna Pfizer first, option available.
I really think based health/age group. think 20s/30s get JJ 40s+ get Mod/Pfizer. 20s/30s part lower risk thus approach would maximize combatting pandemic"
