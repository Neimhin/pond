European countries would ok care, let’s pick Asia Middle East. cultural, language food barriers, would want get sick there.

So let’s reasonable understand reason new employees vaccinated legitimately can’t get vaccine job you. Nah, black fungus unlike covid, difficult impossible treat home, given hospitals facilities treat ,and govt hospitals. Maybe add couple thousand even 5, definitely double at-will employment sort sucks really mandate though. Nobody saying apply airline, know? Yes. Walk come back. That's 2 shots. 1 shot gives great deal protection, single shot vaccines.  vaccines free 18-44 year olds? lowest price saw CoWIN portal Rs 250 government centres upto Rs 1350 private hospitals. 3 million 1% population US.

Is 3 million 12% population 12-17 year olds? seem right, hey.

Are 25 million people range?  Completely agree Yes CDL jobs. basically choose hours, etc point. Companies really hurting. America Europe? Texas? anti vaccine passport movement us pure culture war stirring piece nonsense actively supports continued transmission Covid. Anyone opposes vaccine passports restrictions unvaccinated effectively pro Covid mind. really hope so, doesn’t make sense medical workers treating high risk patients refusing make safer covid goes away news wont actually give fuck. 

Just useless pandering billionaire cooperations I'm BTW black people anti-gay stop trying paint homophobic. take racism elsewhere. every day, often, months. Pfizer won’t last. effectively make illegal big chunk US population travel internationally, passports illegal states. ‘Their house, rules’ international travel.

But I’m flashing vaccination status access pub. I’d sooner watch half pubs UK die. Thanks reply source. Would infectious harmless virus?  Israel released study link Pfizer vaccine myocarditis. found myocarditis appeared disproportionately males. Around 5-25x normal 16-30 age group.

Which vaccine get?  That’s same. I’m getting jabbed, it’s case ‘show medical status entry cannot come in’ I’ll save money hassle. business implements UK, I’ll avoid costs.

Vaccines awesome, cases down, deaths down, herd immunity reached, 0 need coerce unconvinced, especially UK like 96% want anyway. Many Americans gambling problems ""risk"" getting vaccinated win something stimulates parts brain. mid-March latter Yes, myocarditis worry young people general since females males issues getting vaccine. know female friends also expressed worry getting vaccine they’d heard. real takeaway negative stories, way positive ones, although always vigilant, don’t afraid something like getting vaccine. problem. specifically rabid anti-vaxxers people spread disinformation empty rhetoric saw Facebook meme. kind ""refusing vaccinate"" people meant here, people can't hesitant get due medical issues like you. :) Ages 12 older  national database;unless employer administered vaccine probably not. think nearing end vaccinations. county 70% total population fully vaxxed next county less 30%. want gave gotten it. rest either can't get it. Nobody said give hugs.  feel weather,and need go out, wear mask. That's all. get cold every year. Except past year. Id like keep going. Also, get older,the flu becomes dangerous. immune system weakens.  makes sense add roster prevention. Personally CDC telling people wear masks last year nothing worry Korean medical specialists start advocated importance wearing masks social distancing.
Dr Kim US military working various vaccines took current role. I’ve seen interviewed couple times he’s incredibly knowledgeable experienced. trust says. 
There couple interviews YouTube he’s done Asia Boss.  understand possible ill informed, selfish people want avoid vaccinated children vaccinated. 

But really understand someone would go effort create something like this. really think helping people telling avoid vaccine? actually actively trying harm audience?  hanging around hospitals, kids classrooms around immunocompromised family. ""without"" people Yep, like consent handing vaccination record case. violation here. northeast *some* people seem behave sometimes also, theatre crowds aren’t great know go early showtime generally avoid anything terrible, 2 theatres choose also helps that. 

Any recs? horror wouldn’t see Quiet Place Yes well said - seems like fact known widely. Lol gov via newspaper leaks one vaccinated really interested carrying around card showing “virtue check”? whole situation makes cringe.  absolutely agree you! Yeah think giving facts clearly possible would better move. don’t work government agency I’d rather work cause believe flexibility speak mind. you’re right would tell truth would lot easier understand wouldn’t lose everyone’s trust process. ""she want take COVID-19 vaccine full approval U.S. Food Drug Administration.""

Emergency use approval granted, makes perfect sense front line workers *fucking pandemic*. huge lawsuit waiting potentially happen. understand vaccine still eua right? country literally firing government workers (border agents) getting covid vaccinate. no? It’s legal. defensible. Nothing wrong use internationally, domestically don’t think it’s wise. Say 10% population jabbed, economic implications able fire ban society far social COVID risk given you’ll already herd immunity. good complete vaccination, would random epidemics flaring future, particularly non-vaccinated people live clustered communities. Low numbers still numbers stretch long time, add higher numbers Nurses doctors immune idiots. Man, scroll back comments cause you’re doctor wanted see say vaccine stuff. 

Do literally go around different subreddits berate liberals? site appear hate much? 3 million 12-17 year olds US fully vaccinated. 12% population. Don’t tell us do, we’re going tell can’t tell us do! nYAH!!!! Theaters general free all. let reserve seats next strangers going since February every week nobody worn mask. guess seat thing remain Black Widow.

Penn Medicine requiring employees get vaccinated September 1. saying entire time. focus hospitalizations deaths driven false narrative getting COVID isn’t problem long don’t die. isn’t case all. It’s huge public health mistake politicians officials sides aisle guilty it. Makes sense since vaccination takes weeks fully effective immediatr impact mitigation outbreak.

It's driving vaccinations areas though. actual illness disease covid people badly immunocompromised work around rest us. can’t change entire lifestyle based .001% population, it’s idiotic.  It’s almost like people site... really don’t think was. Yeah I’m talking covid, it’s new. assume eventually mandated health care workplaces like others got quite sick dunno every six months :( year yes...

Also argument would ADA violation discriminating medical reason. However allowed 2 reasons. 1. Cost, accommodate disability would put undue burden 2. Safety, accommodate disability would put workers risk. vaccinated clearly putting others risk.

Now whether believe vaccines work irrelevant CDC medical experts say companies covered long based medical advice government guidelines. finding doctor handful doctors disagree 90+% regular doctors count.

It's this, full stop. recent French study (can't link apparently google ""Covid immunity lasts 13 months infection"" find it) concluded 97% infected retained immunity full 13 months later. reason stops 13 months that's long since confirmed infections. could well several years even lifetime.

Your disability doesn’t effect public health. disability isn’t contagious virus that’s caused millions die globally.

You’re also ignoring fact disabilities protected class. vaccinated isn’t. Laws protect people discrimination cover person's race, color, religion, sex (including gender identity, sexual orientation, pregnancy), national origin, age (40 older), disability genetic information. Vaccination status isn’t covered here. Neither idiot. employer completely biased hiring those.

Roughly 63% adults vaccinated IIRC. still plenty adults left low takeup problem now. porn industry, that's exactly happens STIs diseases would relevant. lawsuits brought employers require flu vaccines, like long term care facilities, judges side employers. EEOC came side employers requiring vaccine. different require it. move hospitals, clinics LTC homes. airlines it, healthcare sector. That’s statistics work. need take outcomes consideration apply across entire population.

Btw, kids flu stay home school. Basically, HIPAA applies people health care providers. prospective employer one those.

There may laws, ADA, apply, prevent employers asking vaccine status.

There also variety state laws, many yet tested court (some unlikely survive test). Try going work restaurant without results TB test hot little hand. I’ll pissed welcome foreigners allowing Canadians move freely country.

An outbreak big enough send us back Square One would likely require international community know months anything close borders/send aid impacted nation. Unsure, might complete lack people's understanding Health Insurance Portability Accountability Act for. 

Or might people randomly voting everyone want engage with.

Simply put HIPAA makes sure consent knowledge happens information. would protect employer either Civil Rights Act, Unions (and Norris-LaGuardia Act), National Labor Relations Act (and subsequent acts), OSHA, others. 

An employer allowed ask medical information deem fitting (unless previously agreed upon negotiations). HIPAA prevents asking provider (well, prevents provider telling anything). you, courts, prove information broken one aforementioned laws. regarding covid, simply not. 

The valuable arguments one may getting shot are; medical condition preventing (which would protected Americans Disabilities Act), religious objection (protected first amendment) or, one require case law support, one believes constitutional right Life jeopardize requiring EUA drug administered order find employment. suspect see cases come enough employers fundamentally hinder employment opportunities. However, current moment, gainful employment still plenty places without vaccine. Also, soon FDA gives approval, argument window. know!! whole ""God works mysterious ways"" time saying, ""No, vaccine soon."" Okaaaaay.

This mostly due politicians clueless (that's experts for) general consensus experts/scientists country deemed effective enough, especially ones great access politicians (our Fauci). changed overwhelming evidence effective course pandemic (after summer 2020). another problem: measure would illegal country state emergency (who never declared). pass specific corona law parliament Senate allowing measures. took while, thus mandate went effect December 1st, advice.

And think objective is, trying release measures, except basic measures (like distancing masks) end month, cases, hospitalisations deaths quickly dropping. risk everyone low. everyone's chance get fully vaccinated (doesn't matter less time frame), somewhere coming 2 3 months, measures let go. 

Also, masking rules already strict here. Almost nobody wears mask outside. Smaller children (&lt;12/13 think) never wear masks socially distance, even inside (so basically primary schools measures) inside public building need wear mask moving around, seated. Half million accomodate say handful? also make sound like certainity infected.

Of course perfectly individual choice. one lives bubble even vaccine, one person's carelessness might affect others. need roadmap returning normal cases may never reach zero. Additionally, there's evidence CDC guidance saying vaccinated people need wear mask causing reluctant people get vaccinated. that's good news.

Amazon (where work) still mask policy place see stand see vaccination rates. hiring bunch new people imo need more. Maybe Amazon might similar policy soon, employees fall back incase go. Would surprise me. 

I remember highschool threatened expulsion getting vaccine. ended getting it, could younger medical reasons. Even get Johnson vaccine medical reason amazon provide. got moderna elsewhere. 

There legal precedent fire refusal vaccine. Although weird grey area. people get certain vaccines people religious reasons wont. right force hand? Covid infection rate, kill rate. Like Polio much higher odds death get required. Question line is. Also field matter lot, airline makes lot sense. local warehouse make sense though?

What ever outcome recommend getting vaccinated. see Microsoft dreams every night month. would apply current employees WOULD fact violation HIPAA? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ don’t get people freaking about. people freak everything don’t they? it’s well good fuckhead who’s read much Ayn Rand decides get vaccinated transmits immunosuppressive mother “individual liberty”. things important personal wishes. 

You’re actively choosing comment fact adverse reactions incredibly rare, whereas effect reaching true herd immunity means actual issues bear burden. private business allowed bailed federal government. HIPAA federal law. OP, pro vaccination work medical field Naw, jobs pay well especially work remotely huge demand. restaurant workers really would rather worth home make lot money.  going best 5g skys think anyone considers people position (being unable receive secondary vaccination doses due medical reasons) selfish. Much contrary, group whose inability take vaccines means suffer elevated risk people could get vaccine don't.

Almost kids health problems vaccinated.

Totally different scenario we're dealing currently. Ahh, apparently business decision company fires woman pregnant must make sure outlawed federal level. sure is, basic herd immunity. fact, know believe people get vaccinated either reason. Getting vaccinated due direct social pressure vs fear concerns. think artificial fear necessary here, eventually, options get vaccinated, keep wearing mask, *and* making others around wear masks(in California, OSHA doing. Unvaxxed person room? Everyone wear mask.), people going go get vaccinated due peer pressure alone. Please final checks waiting walk back in, fire them.

Why countries, especially Canada, pushing greater intervals doses 1 2? 

The CDC says Pfizer taken 3 weeks bummer? proud card. don’t see much that, though, frequently encounter impatient people still denial everything happened really really want brush everything rug they’re antsy, defensively go “well hide home you’re scared” anytime someone mentions toll taken. (Or worse, people still insist “hoax” somehow one died) Hopefully mine thing I'd like less going cruise right now, going cruise bunch anti-vaxxers.

I've seen people firmly believe one points change mind, issue convinced experts *actually trusted already*. that's US screwed itself. many people trusted medical professionals calmly meet lead concerns (for host reasons, obviously). actually blame people trusting politicians, family members annoy unrelated reasons, newscaster TV, random dude reddit.

I get plenty overworked doctors doctors give crap conversations. seeing someone life get talked gastroenterologist people, think would hope people getting medical professional life actually trusted. Yup, gave birth January 2020 people really don’t realize traumatic whole experience continues be. I’d bet don’t understand science. Wasted even want help. Meanwhile, people elsewhere world die poor access vaccine. probably employment contracts terms them. can't retroactively apply binding terms add new contracts. can't think reason something like would happen. 

Let's say coronavirus enters body. immune system detects something weird going sends white blood cell go check out. WBC brings coronavirus lymph node broken pieces. pieces examined dendritic cell dendritic cell determine antibody needs sent take care virus. important note different antibody response chosen disease body encounters. determined microbiological level protein identification.

Basically, immune system smart enough know antibody use disease response. really scenario body would say, ""Oh hey, meningitis. know I've got perfect antibody that, think I'll use COVID antibody instead funsies. first crazy vaccine rewards get needed. entire ""news"" channel devoted vaccine skepticism. Even swallowed hook, line sinker might enough get gullible person say ""hey maybe need it"".

So yeah, dangle big prize front alternative stick (like see here). Making threats vaccine ugly road go down. kinda wish United would said giving heavy preference vaccinated hires extremely unlikely unvaccinated person could get job. Say externally, internally basically ban unvacced hires. Case rate gotten low outbreaks among low vaccinated areas (from unvaccinated people) starting cause needle go little areas. 

Which means going get dishonest media reports ""concerning"" areas ""raising rates x amount states"" coming. Sprinkle little ""variant dangerous causing increase!!1"" 

None concern normal citizen unless live area unvaccinated. Canada currently sitting stockpile J&amp;J distributing them, they'd simply expire too. problem still people unemployment rolls middle Covid still bringing home enough via unemployment Cares money make getting job less desirable.     
    
Let's take Ky example, am. get max unemployment roughly $415/wk plus $300/wk Cares. That's $715/wk.     
     
That breaks $18/hr job. Cares money goes away there's little incentive workers re-enter workforce less money.     
     
Why take job $10-15/hr still stay home?     
     
When Cares money ends people start hitting end unemployment eligibility period, people end back labor pool.    
     
Covid shut everything down, people got laid off. economy opened back ramping back normal, roaring back. Every employer shed jobs covid scramble hire. Meanwhile, potential workers making $18/hr staying home now, means smaller pool labor every business draw from. Definitely. R vary population behavior. recall NYC, probably R knocked low, perhaps 0.3 0.4 April 2020. summer, R around 1, often below, sometimes above, restrictions loosened summertime weather here. run long time relatively loose precautions original strain R around 0.9/1.0, suddenly get strain R around 2 *with precautions* exponential growth stomp know it. get stricter, and, whereas could get R 0.4, 0.9 new strain, cases, decline, decline quickly. dont know got comment, 100% favor using money hazard pay lol Yay! Touché actually Guangzhou suspended vaccinations week focus totally testing tracing. although heard going Stat vaccinating soon.  Heights seems like perfect “return movies” type film shouldn’t money? Seems like good use me. guys legend!! People clean stuff, stock stuff, move beds around, etc. like OP said least educated. Could also mean nurses nursing assistants though, folks dumb. That’s really interesting! makes sense avoid pregnancy trial, needs “real world” studies hundreds millions people start taking vaccines. Lots people don’t take hormonal birth control. 

I feel like experience Pfizer would useful researchers. normal blood work months prior, don’t take medication anything, exercise several days week, eat healthy diet. don’t smoke, drink month so. say suggest *best* explanation period turned upside 30 years rock solid predictability vaccine. doubt it’s dangerous, definitely studied understood.

Let’s, arguments sake, assume pandemic originated laboratory-acquired infection.

Lots evidence former. little evidence latter. give two examples 'surges.' One Wyoming say one lowest COVID-19 vaccination rates U.S., recently saw hospitalization numbers climb again, state data shows.

If click state data, ""climb again"" means going \~20 end April \~40 today... entire state, peak 247 November 30th. That's quite creative interpretation word 'surge.'

We’ve Royal Caribbean family years- went NCL cruise years ago nice clientele much older Royal. said, may NCL family now…  OK. Maybe distance ride exhausted it. I'll check w/ 2nd shot day.  Funny come up. calculated numbers last night. goal reach 181 million adults vaccinated least 1 dose vaccine. shy 162 million adults received least one dose. currently 1.2 -1.3 million vaccinations day. know many second dose, presume half majority people 18, would another 16 million adults immunized Independence Day. track squeaker. isn’t vaccine resistant wind go back start.

We going start - knocks vaccine efficacy bit start higher (like Pfizer) bad.  🤦‍♂️ guess we'll stay lowdowns forever lol fucking psychopaths man. ... racism medical science, comparison make sense...

You might well try convince people Salem witch trials witches real. means witch too. 

Many people quickly believe claims racism, many people believe doubt claim racism must racist. 

The Tuskegee comparison used sway people's opinion even need make sense. fact, whether makes sense largely irrelevant many people. think he's referring eligible population referring total population. decided Google RKJ read Robert Kennedy Jr. pleased see random SoundCloud rappers coming three pages Google search Robert Kennedy Jr does, really shows relevant opinions I’m sorry economy. live NYC. lot us died. Huh, work quite colleagues NL never heard Vacation Fund extra wage.

This something everybody gets regardless job? last thing read Uber giving 4 rides $25 get vaccination appointments. you’re fully vaccinated isn’t issue you, mask not, brilliant minds CDC said so. But, it’s like, means past year stuck line transmission primarily close contact infected persons (hence 2m distance rule became ubiquitous). reality pass close infected person street nothing happen (unless sneeze you). inside poorly ventilated restaurant, sitting far others still catch COVID.  
 
Better ventilation would help reduce COVID many airborne illnesses. time national standards workplaces schools. think us saying a) yes workers paid fairly exploited also b) higher wage anecdotally solve problem long term (might work short term though awesome) UK here. fully vaccinated fine, cases we've far hit around 2% less fully vaccinated, however 1 dose higher crazy, said running rampant unvaccinated people, even faster Kent (B.1.1.7) variant. Cases doubled less week, far steeper increase winter Kent variant place, short time Delta variant superceeded Kent variant.

To clarify, fully vaccinated around 98% safe form severity catching Delta variant. 1 dose around 70% likely catch / get ill shown single dose provides 33% effectiveness. completely unvaccinated, around 40% likely catch Delta variant Kent variant, around 50% transmissible OG strain, already started create rises hospitalisations deaths also short time. kids, see fit parent, parenting ""style"" exactly want *my* kids vaccinated. know hate strict interact playground, school, anywhere else may go. want diversity relationships lifetimes, ***and*** want get transmit Covid-19 anyone. unvaccinated people? entirely possible reason wearing mask foreseeable future, even though fully vaccinated Moderna. I'm car mechanic believe brake jobs. I'm plumber believe clearing clogged drains. I'm airline pilot believe using radar. I'm teacher believe reading.

What nurses, professional medical personnel lives well patients hands every day believe in? Voodoo? heck teaching nursing schools today? Thoughts prayers? Reading animal entrails?

This country serious problem pandemic laid see.  Sees 69..


Internally: (hehe nice)  bunch folks (with exceptions, course), duty war Covid...they deserted, went AWOL, refused fight, chickened out...whatever. Can't believe end get reward. like paying ransom capitulating terrorists. (or rewarding deep lack community commitment sacrifice greater good. assume during, say, WWII, folks would black-marketing ration chits refusing blackout windows night because...""I can't see dark."").

Maybe change hats say: ""Make America Sick Again"" Let's repeal law see CDC say.

Why read findings? Lol. pandemic ever history ever lasted long. Yeah flu may kill covid can. .0001% population. Again.. masking kids protect people, right?  aware still known vaccinated people transmit virus, right? wearing mask convenience protect others.. true?    we? Nope. they? Yep, guarantee still aren’t. mean, OK lets say go ahead vaccine passport ban. happens there's covid cases board? Quarantine again?

Absolutely not.

If there's outbreak, (or, really, anything ""COVID-Like"" symptoms) cruise lines immediately divert ship Florida. According Florida's elected political heroes, COVID big deal they'll absolutely willing welcome plague ships open arms.

The truth nothing replace in-person instruction. pandemic proved it, college definitely K-12. bad, Carl makes think persons “natural” recovery would robust? vaccines, many strains targeted body produces necessary immune response, “natural” infection, body fights specific strain received.

This follow- done everything still gotten it- nobody said guidelines guarantee, minimized risk things need anyways, live building need take garbage- yes distanced hallway share elevator mean can't gotten here. laundry- 3 kids laundry weekly chore nonnegotiable unless absurd amount spend new outfits every day also go work pay rent, worked food service far adamant making customers coworkers mask people listen. ever eat, I'd go outdoors bite refining masks coming back in. wife also go work pay rent plenty parents teachers school way lax masks done? Gotten tens thousands debt reported school got shut down?- lost 1k salary last months school went remote last admittance saw parents siblings pandemic

Yes, masked, outdoors, distanced, usually short periods twice ate dinner separate tables parents backyard (did mention mom wfh dad furloughed neither really went anywhere either?) supposed believe ""did everything could?""

You whatever want- I'm relating experience really isn't. I'm basing dozen comments made thread.

You mean ones say trust medical professionals actually files random redditors? Hospitals desperate workers. Although get paid enough absolute horse shit going right now. many labs hiring right now, least life science. Moderna. started 4 weeks got second dose cool. You’re refusing take it. can’t valid reason. There's exactly many medical exemptions wearing mask: none.

At least people dumb enough try excuses make easy filter out. best friend valid phobia needles. cerebral palsy every time gets shot sends tremors nuts (they're usually mild), point can't feed drink rest day. hates feeling like that.

He got shots. time I've known anything medically related five years. important even it. hated every bit it. still it. Good one moronic comment That's true. Massachusetts, vaccination rate highest country, significantly expanded homebound vaccination program couple weeks ago. folks get out, availability vaccines recently increased. shortage J&amp;J due problems Baltimore plant made rollout slower anticipated. 

Another significant issue polling folks vaccinated yet concerns missing work due side effects. availability issue, constraint vaccine hesitancy financial precarity. consider people anti-vaxxers means. someone dies Covid refused get vaccine company? would grounds sue? also would prove contracted work Honestly, I'm wondering much matters point. 7 day average slightly 14k yesterday continuing drop.  course people getting vaccinated, seems least US virus getting smothered pretty soon here. may get random kick ups among unvaccinated folks realize people fly countries, really seems like reaching end. Lol literally everyone complains shitty comment history. Every single time. FrEeDoM!! 1! Impressive technology. United States this. Strange, actually upvoted comment Taiwan screwed up.

[According Taiwan almost finalized deal contract purchase BioNTech vaccines, however deal broke drafting press release included term ""country"". Hardly fault Taiwan... pathetic Businesses forced government require vaccinations. makes sense right thing protect employees (and end, good bottom line, well).

You're deep end think requiring vaccine deadly disease causing global pandemic equivalent conservative bullcrap - like hiring women birth control hiring LGBTQ+ people. former plain science, latter bullcrap. Wierd. Thanks downvote tho Good point one less argument deniers. can't say ""What's point variants coming?"" Yes, yes guess it’s cool companies ask confirm HIV status  interesting June 15th mask mandate removed. do? I'm sure requirement apply vaccines American travelers coming U.S. Obviously U.S. origin coming area dangerous disease endemic destination different requirements. yeah, travelling place things like malaria endemic might want keep mind :) Doesn’t wasn’t vaccine = capacity toddler 

Makes sense  Overdoing prevented many deaths. many things, messaging confusing. vaccines first came out, stop transmission, enough information *know* whether stopped transmission. 

So message was, get vaccinated yourself, still mask case transmit someone else. 

Subsequent studies real world results show vaccine fact significantly limit transmission. Nothing 100%, low rates breakthrough infections transmission via vaccinated people, generally, vaccine significantly reduce transmission well nearly always prevent infection, particularly one ends hospitalization death.

It's normal confused different information that's come out. know vaccines reduce transmission significantly.  Interesting know Yep. coffee shop, we’ve problem whatsoever staying staffed. starting pay well minimum wage (and always been). Funny works… that, predict lawyers gearing whole swath COVID related lawsuits. words, airlines need due diligence Got love Facebook meme news great things it’s done society past decade. NYT author even live NYC? Every weekend seen bars lounges jam packed pre-pandemic levels minimal masks bar/batmitzvahs held steadily throughout. Lol.

I'm willing bet live HOA. agree point. comparable requiring degree. public health issue job capability issue. Shhh, let dream... fucking stupid ass religion says can't vaccinated?

Let narrow question: getting data states effectiveness COVID vaccines immunocompromised people lower general public?

Also, “common sense” argument. “Common sense” lead subreddit fear monger fourth wave post Memorial Day; common sense lead many people subreddit think many things turned incorrect throughout pandemic. I'm saying mandatory. I'm saying itll choice person makes own.  nobody bullying choice. get AZ vaccine?  Also note COVID-19 implicated causing transverse myelitis.   That's nice still got clearly everything said. Even admittance saw parents siblings pandemic, I'm supposed believe ""did everything could?"" Covid walk back door infect you. maybe next time make snap judgement someone based little info

Yeah really isn't. I'm basing dozen comments made thread. past year?  60% one person wears it.  80% wearing it.  0% nobody is.  better option prevent catching flu? Australia, island, less visitors? seem right.

Australia massively fewer ways enter country places share land border. 13 international airports something like 38 ports entry.

You cross United States 167 different land border crossings, 328 ports entry, 149 international airports (with regional airports allowing small number international flights).

During pandemic Australia welcomed 794,000 passengers internationally. USA 63,000,000.

I think pretty easy see Australia MUCH easier problem solve comes securing various ways country United States (and countries land borders) have. smaller much easier problem. Makes people click. least feel good Florida feel come them. many people hugely disappointed Florida okay moment. Lol well good luck little one! Take care.   certain countries still require fancy vaccines though... get shit come back too. I'm one college people actually turned okay things stay I'm gonna advise kid learn trade. 

If pick right college degree make ton money, kids *in state* tuition projected $200k 4 year degree. way that's sustainable. Get 2 year degree vocational school jump workforce sooner. might make less absolute dollars extra years + lower debt burden huge advantage terms lifetime earnings.  CDC power make policy (only guidance). States like Texas make policy, based various inputs (one CDC). ok. guess every mainstream news source made up. people would deny someone autonomy choose vaccinate want abortion laws. want abortion too, thought interesting one, happy new 5G hot spot comes everywhere. handy! Isn’t river courthouse somethin? HR dept covered entity definitely wrong. don’t need Google know people work department United that’s works Delta, also known B16172

Purposefully marketing wage shortage labor shortage way lax regulations get government pay big business' training new employees. serves expand labor pool reduce wages.

It's nothing new either: happening since least 70s further. also likely trump ass lickers. HR departments deal medical information covered HIPAA varying extent -- especially self insured (as larger employers are). one would lie get bar. Trolling? call names, merely stared fact Bunch nurses suing going strike major hospital Texas requiring workers vaccinated. Great know! Cheers Haven’t looked every business across country, haven’t noticed labor shortages around here. Everything seems staffed adequately.   approved. I’ll wait till is. Get want. one telling Lyfted up. think actually need even somewhat logical argument? No, happens fuck people long. suppose proof vaccinations asked required decades. work healthcare protective personal privacy. plenty examples forced compliance country. everything slippery slope leads concentration camps. cringe really true. plenty valid medical conditions would make vaccine option. example, imunocompromised people may able get it. That's people ""need"" still get it.

The thing is, condition bad enough can't get vaccine (or even wear mask), going public maskless exposing covid absolutely way worse. Pretty much anyone claims they're anti-mask health reasons moron. certainly work position public airline job health concern.

But again, change fact totally valid medical reasons someone get vaccine.  National Donut Day surge beginning. Kind bet vast majority WFH employees take time off. Personally didn’t take time either shot took easy day two second shot. employer didn’t force work day got vaccinated like airlines doing. get reasoning bit different many industries Right work. 

You find another job. said understand real life works. Taiwan fumbling? many days break they? long take Singapore stamp out? yet hear company something like making exception people medical exemption.

In fact I’m almost positive would covered ADA cases medical condition prevented someone vaccinated.  would wanted.  require vaccines lots things, schools. I'm opposed vaccines get full fda approval. opposed. took vaccine, I'm pro vax, fully approved still experimental.  Let's praise company's. real reason want worker take weeks get sickness lol No. app use location information without permission. give permission, update location information scan QR code use backbone app like WeChat/Alipay. drove Beijing Tianjin, using phone navigate whole way, returned Beijing without going public places. checked trip app afterwards, record going Tianjin all.

After chaos early days epidemic, China managed protect much personal privacy possible effectively tracking contacts. long travel public places, keep private data well protected. That's works. case unlawful discrimination hiring someone they're vaccinated.

Also, know lot companies health insurances charge higher premiums smokers, right? That’s I’m southwest fan.

Cheaper average airline also doesn’t treat like literal sardine  insurance already something similar smokers definitely see happening people refuse vaccine. another small government conservative using government tell businesses do. people count people? Nobody saying vaccine 100% effective cases. doubt they'll even bother apply. Probably. It’s definitely ‘don’t worry much’ sub, least compared r/coronavirusca. right now, 7,230 cases reported US. Assuming go much, lowest reported since 3/21 7-day average low 3/28! amazing story.

**VACCINES FUCKING WORK.**

I actually able convince vaccine-hesitant friend get jab showing spectacular plunge cases US, contrasted places like India Brazil virus still raging vaccination rates low, also well-vaccinated countries like Chile Seychelles used less-effective vaccines. *really* helped seal deal giving credit (where credit due) prior Administration providing significant funds pharmaceutical companies research buying doses, thus significantly de-risking expensive process developing vaccines companies, ensuring supply would available post-development. *much* horribly botched US, leading many avoidable deaths, Operation Warp Speed list.  Ok I’ll play along then.

Simply, ain't it?  There’s limits can’t asked for, depending job, limits may vary. Vaccinations fall within limits jobs far I’m aware.  lot women menstruate included trial...? mostly post menopausal women...? many questions.

If anything, looks like taiwan following footsteps vietnam thailand also quite well early pandemic almost full blown outbreak right now.

Their death numbers concerning. Either taiwanese variant far deadliest strain case numbers reflect reality.

I think anyone actually following covid information say taiwan far better west, ""we're bad"" exact reason west poorly. Unfortunately, mentality also prevalent mentality taiwanese. understanding none vaccines fully certified FDA yet. means person can't legally compelled employer take them. 

Nope. means government employers (like military) can't force it. Private employers absolutely can, they're totally allowed fire refuse. Seasonality too, last year saw significant decline number new cases summer well. COVID like respiratory viruses spread easily(though obviously still spread) warm, moist weather. That's states like Florida Texas never saw huge numbers seen northern states one factors pundits like bring fit sort agenda.

I'm giving hugs every flu season personally, already disinfected sanitized pre-pandemic. Even though covid turned really spread surfaces, fact everyone cleaning frequently going help much substantially long run wearing masks every winter. 

And flu vaccine fairly efficable. guessing game scientists usually guess correctly. I'm saying difference masks make negligible long vaccinated, considering likely one peole wearing mask next year. 

I've caught flu literally entire life got regular flu shots. trick always washing hands lol. free wear mask winter guess I'm going stick getting vaccines.

Secondly, everyone vaccinated, mean everyone continue mask up, socially distance, work home vaccine ""only"" 95 percent effective? everyone cannot get vaccinated mean force health choices upon people. another way say it? tech industry make people take technical tests make sure they're stupid... similar  point **are** less likely get vaccinated. That’s vaccine hesitancy means. mandating vaccines automatically exclude minorities more.

Yes **could** get vaccinated individual level. hesitancy **is** statistically higher minority communities mandating vaccines won’t change that. logically follows mandating vaccines take away opportunities minorities.

Until education campaigns bring minority vaccine hesitancy levels near average levels minorities disproportionately disadvantaged vaccine mandate. shirt, shoes, service.

Great success! unvaccinated responsible new Covid Danish study really horrible. confirmed people didn’t follow directions wrote study.  Well 99% people getting hospitalized virus unvaccinated. Vaccinated people barely getting sick needing hospitalizations. 

From bottom line standpoint, even virus never killed single human being, damn good fiscal sense hire people vaccinated virus potentially put employee commission weeks end, including ICU stays follow-up therapy potentially taking months employee back feet.  


Even ignored potential costs business, idea possible candidate employment incapable understanding basic science taking personal responsibility prevent possible hospitalizations months therapy seems like immediate disqualifying event want hire quality individuals capable handling fleets aircraft passengers day. Look uptakes UK vs US. UK, nearly everyone age range vaccinated uptake, ~100% 60s). US, many vaccinate.

UK, far demand still holds, even 75% eligible population (over 16 least) choosing vaccinate, division age keeps on, works logistic, although I'm fan letting 16-24 totally unvaccinated (except ill ones) long time remembered US technically national ID form passport cards allow limited travel outside US. also accepted ID &amp; US-wide.

One credit cards back allow Chip &amp; PIN. don't. debit cards Chip &amp; PIN. saying opposite. claimed airline jobs don’t require higher Ed, higher Educated get jobs, leaving without degree also likely vaccibe following j&amp;j awful. know part fewer shots given mRNA vaccines would love see SOMETHING real world efficacy, especially longer term phase 1/2 data showed continuing increase immune response like two months jab. guess would hearing serious breakthrough cases happening regularity silence topic really frustrating! I've fully vaccinated since February, family friends fully vaccinated, still wear KN 95 instances leave house (And continue rip face). 

As reward getting new job, decided would visit girlfriend upcoming weekend lives far enough away would need fly. worry I'm way selfish. end catching despite vaccine + mask? end vector spreading covid everyone care about? know anything ever without feeling selfish they're saying educated ppl less likely antivax. That's said airline workers tend lower education status *and* United might lose large portion hiring pool. Yes. 

We friend owns restaurant neighborhood he’s shut operations 3 times employee testing positive. Every shutdown costly time lost, testing employees, sanitizing restaurant anyone allowed back. 

It’s far, far, far cheaper require employees vaccinated. Pilots flight attendants unionized United won’t able require they’re vaccinated unless bargain Movie theaters already pretty safe pre-vaccines; outbreaks linked back them, much likely get person going movie random person audience. vaccine, safe ever been. major chains allow go unmasked vaccinated too, good.

Everyone knows it. 

It's like dictatorship lie portray positive light. like certain important date passed recently probably even important people dying virus, deny. weird response. first half comment calls sympathy towards people continue wear mask, judging others they're comfortable with. immediately condescend anxiety situation.

I personally anxiety situation like that, also live state still essentially mask mandate everyone, ""back normal"" feeling many y'all thread talk lost me. things went back normal got weeks crowded events, big hangouts, masks, etc. imagine would pretty severe emotional whiplash stepping establishment feels like 2020 still, put mask back feeling like free would definitely bum bit, even understand logically. always tell people think COVID serious: I'm afraid dying. I'm afraid 1. Long term problems 2. accompanying medical bills. Yes, lot. Good thought. Many also like ""I got covid, need vaccine!""  agnostic towards it, really get reasoning.

A misguided sense indignant freedumb. Businesses never able operate want? This. 

Also, knowing virus immediately put employee hospital weeks end something essentially completely avoidable proactive action seems like no-brainer comes time decide pay. Damn, took long? don’t know anyone US hasn’t received shots already (that wanted it) 700 Million 1.4 Billion people. However people 2 shots considerably lower , since people got first shot. 

China's situation still Jeopardy since home-grown vaccines ain't good. months BnT vaccines approved home-made mRNA vaccine go Phase III, assume China good shape around year-end. I’m going show pass ID allowed visit places country.

Businesses allowed feely refuse service whomever want. support right small businessmen refuse service whomever please, must also support repealing civil rights act 1964. Huh. thought disbanded. dream that?  many people care take vaccines?

Great question. 3 major reasons:

1. actually want black people die, that's (as probably know) happens people get vaccinated. part ""their choice, guess"" component, suppose one people let go. Except...

2. Herd immunity. Without population immunized, disease continues spreading, remains danger people want vaccinated can't (e.g. immunocompromised people). worst all...

3. Vaccine-resistant mutation risk. virus stopped tracks, high risk becoming another influenza, sticks around forever, coming back seasonally, many variants end bouncing around block (or even know them). COVID-19 lot characteristics make likely act way stopped outright. far largest problem, stop communities, likely repeatedly return, cumulatively killing could easily upwards 100 million people coming centuries.

All said, get black communities would wary vaccine medical science general, done fucked shit black people. really imperative every community reach herd immunity, world going much larger problem hands.

And like asking black people help protect white people, history indicator comes long-running viruses, hardest hit places going global south marginalized communities - i.e. people disproportionately black. Yes Screw homophobic lead singer Yeah pay enough get onto floating fucking petri dish vaccine not.

I wonder they'll problems staffing cruises? literally new song mick jagger mocking antivaxxers. “easily forged receipt” find secure digital vaccination record easily. Stop fear mongering losers. Covid done us long shot  poor staff, though... even hazard pay would enough Foo fighters term UFOs WW2...UFO videos dropping month...coincidence ?? trying intentionally blind state pandemic?

Like lot hoops jump put fingers ears scream CoViD ovEr. Excelsior! Vaxx required Trey @ Beacon ""All attendees vaccinated liars."" It’s risk per infection higher transmission rate means kids likely get infected first place That's bold claim, least given we're talking situations little 40% population fully vaccinated. course people mix completely across groups, mix, evidence lower total infections uniform spread around 40% total weak.. hand, evidence concentrating vaccines risk groups growing time, evidenced hospitalizations UK now.

I'd definitely take protected risk groups. last line.

The ""rushing"" get back normal really start fall, maybe six months in. time asking questions anyway.

But yeah six months shocker anyone people asking questions something *affects lives* expect end looking hope soon.

But no, time even merely entertaining idea going back normal expressing desire positivity, would seen heartless asshole compassion died lost people.

Health ministry Lithuania said days ago expect Curevac Novavax approved month… wonder changed They're not. likely Excelsior App they're using. one common one NY venues. threatening anyone anymore amount vaxxed people

That’s actually true. I’ll give example. sister-in-law MS relies caregivers help daily basis. Since takes Rituximab (an immune modulating medication) keep MS bay, one ones still susceptible even though vaccinated. 

So, one caregivers decides go concert unvaccinated vaccinated gets COVID, bring right tiny little living room even realize sick. Since spend several hours day her, masks helpful fully protective.

This also stands one caregiver’s household members goes concert instead, one close friends spend time indoors unmasked. 

Right now, people highest risk unvaccinated *and* immunocompromised, whether go concert themself not. 

Please keep mind. Please look loved ones. still find people able give shots availability matches w/the expiration dates. still fly drive doses neighborhoods. let people neighborhoods know it’s happening deal weather/mechanical/unforeseen delays. sure it’s safe vaccinators go neighborhoods sure they’re properly trained prepared equipped PPE. really fast even though JJ stable still storage requirements.

Who gives vaccines? military? neighborhoods ok people uniform going door-to-door? trust process? afraid take shots? long convincing family take? enough people home school, working, market? planners get information? communicate w/the community? follow person potentially allergy reaction? 

It’s like passing leaflets door door delivering pizzas, it’s little complicated that.

All leaves aside dosing/handling/packaging requirements different country-to-country, regulations, approvals, etc No, keep asking try create false equivalency ID vaccine card. really point question begin with. Hence copy paste. Hence request honest question. Good point. goes hero. look link? right. I'm embarrassed. Yes children people? mental capacity toddler.

However, remember efficacy based comparison placebo group, comparing \*with behaviors\*, many people got sick either group. Yeah, I'd love $400/wk back, haha… hopefully 2022 go public again. I'm cycling _must_ cycle street, nice fully breathe car exhaust.  How? living fear? told I'm not, talk specifics, anyway. even problem anything do? life, yours. find hilarious headlines use ""Delta"" expand ""detected India"" one knows are. theater fun. absolute terms, sure, overall California \~35/51 (including DC) cases per capita, around 11/51 vaccination first doses. People want pretend like solely vaccines &amp; natural immunity way gloss potential benefits relatively cautious reopening. April mini-surge affect CA affect Florida similar cases per capita point.

In reality, probably combination weather effects, random luck, high natural immunity SoCal (specifically LA County hard hit counties), good mask/ distance compliance Bay Area (which low relative natural immunity), high first dose vaccination rates, and, yes, gradual reopening. make medical decisions, confronting letting give long talks conspiracy theories? adult. ask, do.

If find living frustrating, probably living anymore. magical combination words fix them. you’re living fear misread, reason assumed 2 kids. Either way, that's nice chunk. required think mask usage monitored study. Assuming placebo group behaved similarly, effects masking balanced out. Efficacy relative control group. Yeah clearly uneducated person points valid.... Hopefully not. Unfortunately lower vax rate communities potential clusters important. vaccinated right little suggest personal safety risk normal circumstances foreseeable future. Best luck. combat misinformation good information willing listen.

1. Pregnant women excluded initial studies women studies got pregnant test phase ill effects. Vaccination pregnant women studied since found protect mother baby. Pregnant women high risk candidates COVID it’s highly recommended get vaccinated.

2. You’re right wouldn’t test vaccines infected people. Like pregnant women, however, doses given infected people since original study.

Actually - it’s frustrating, tell 1.5 billion vaccines given. working last years data. theory cost vs. benefit analysis. perfect world dirty P word involved. arguing against, think right answer perse. Even ignore costs wearing mask pretend benefits. Assuming sort efficacy, clearly fairly low compared something like vaccine. Lets sake conversation put 15%. Today many states dipping 1% positivity rate many jurisdictions approaching 1 case per 100K. Throwing another 15% top going much. comparison 5% positivity say 10 cases per 100k. Basically diminishing return, lower numbers get. point little virus start considering whatever downsides mask wearing exist, may well outweigh benefits.  percentage oldest vunerable people vaccinated? got vaccinated December, looking forwards getting booster. work travel industry wait turn get covid. Cheers mate. Duh 

I'm maths dummy I’m said reasons pressure allies creating difficult, transparent, easily- communicated hurdles jump. Looks like France opening doors vaccinated. actually Fosun got exclusive distribution rights great China area...Wording matter. European, I'm happy BioNTech decided get support Pfizer approval-related things, also production support. say ""they never allowed partner US company!"" I'm pretty sure net positive both, Europe US. Ugur Sahin, Özlem Türeci everyone else BioNTech know doing, decision get Pfizer board great.

You see results ""small startup wants everything own"" looking CureVac (even partnered Bayer things going really slow though).

Moderna lucky simply they're US, NIAID helped lot trials, approvals, etc. Nothing like EU / Germany, far tell. instant FDA gives full approval, they’ll find excuse get it. constantly moving goal posts. kids love watching HIPPA Hog. think misunderstanding. asked SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2. 

In study linked above, people retained immunity 12 years infection.

Please check abstract paper. Exactly allowed discriminate them.  employer able know hire someone based private medical history. doesnt mean anything lol. Google business nexus is. Yes, that’s important distinction efficacy infection vs efficacy death. You’re saying you’re fine higher rate infection, since death rates comparable doesn’t matter? 

Covid spreads infection death, fact higher death rate would slow infection (e.g. Ebola). makes total sense vaccine worse slowing infection would cause cases drop slower rate vaccine effective preventing infection.

I get it’s still good vaccine much cheaper produce, store distribute mRNA ones, undeniably worse preventing spread infection. FWIW, fiancé gave birth recently got vaccinated pregnant. OB recommending get Astra Zeneca get one mRNA vaccines possible. understand unique scenario, clearly health care professionals see advantages certain vaccines others.

What already known topic? 
 
Most COVID-19–associated hospitalizations occur adults, severe disease occurs age groups, including adolescents aged 12–17 years. 
 
What added report? 
 
COVID-19 adolescent hospitalization rates COVID-NET peaked 2.1 per 100,000 early January 2021, declined 0.6 mid-March, rose 1.3 April. Among hospitalized adolescents, nearly one third required intensive care unit admission, 5% required invasive mechanical ventilation; associated deaths occurred. 
 
What implications public health practice? 
 
Recent increased hospitalization rates spring 2021 potential severe disease reinforce importance continued COVID-19 prevention measures, including vaccination correct consistent mask wearing among persons fully vaccinated required. exactly deny existence racism medicine? comment specifically regard COVID vaccine. gaslighting anti-vaxxers trying draw parallels safe effective vaccine, horrific instances exploitation human experimentation.

Besides hypocritical, Texas Florida would almost assuredly lose court case cruise industry one. Besides Commerce Clause limiting state's ability interfere interstate commerce, Congress passed laws empower CDC regulate public health.

On top that, even somehow court case this, they'd chopping nose spite face; many cruises dock Florida Texas make port countries almost certainly require passengers vaccinated visit. win look like situation? people get boats can't get Cancun? Stay classy, Texas! 💉 vast majority people high risk vaccinated thankfully take less toll. wish people would get vaccinated, we're quickly approaching level risk that's par background risk infectious diseases everyone coped prior pandemic. Jesus Christ Nancy, stop melodramatic. 

Fact matter good, well meaning people carry diseases everyday. They’re private company don’t want deal bullshit, want get fucking vaccine. Much like schools hospitals required generations. 

Get grip. Right. Especially plane companies fuck air costing 5 years lives depending region. kinkshame BBP? could require proof people HIV taking proper medication keep counts low? Right, take much hit max employment. employed 6-9 months Covid, anything minimum wage, going hit maximum. Even without max UI, peak Cares Act 600/wk, bringing home $800/wk still likely. Even today reduced Cares Act $300/wk, still collect $500/wk, still $12/hr job.    
       
If options collect can't $12/hr (or more) get retail, food, entry industrial job $10-15/hr now, go back work? many, there's little upside. Time working easily spent finding securing job closer $15/hr mark going back whatever $12/hr job get stuck year two. family really needs extra $3/hr (6k/yr), healthcare, may reason suck go back work collect UI/Cares.     
         
But things sit, individual collect equivalent half average household income state (~$48k Ky) thru UI Cares Act, many jobs barely pay that, there's lot incentive people position jump back work yet. USA update first dose shots:

Mixed Findings 
 
So far, studies examining whether statins might benefit people COVID-19 retrospective analyses hospitalized patients. try mimic randomized controlled clinical trials, researchers matched patients who’d taking statins basis factors vital signs, laboratory values, body mass index—a method called propensity-score matching. 
 
Their findings haven’t consistently linked drugs lower short-term risk dying contracting COVID-19. observational studies found association statin use lower mortality among patients COVID-19: 
 
In article published earlier year, Gupta colleagues found among 1296 New York City patients hospitalized COVID-19, 26.5% patients hadn’t taking statins died within 30 days hospital admission compared 14.8% patients used drugs. 
 
Wayne State University researchers found cohort 466 patients hospitalized COVID-19, taking moderate high doses statins, low doses, significantly reduced risk dying compared taking statins. study didn’t find significant association statin use intensive care unit (ICU) admission need mechanical ventilation. 
 
A study 1179 patients COVID-19 Massachusetts General Hospital yet peer-reviewed found statin use hospitalization, newly initiated not, associated improved 28-day mortality patients older 65 years patients 65 years younger. 
 
In study nearly 14 000 patients hospitalized COVID-19 Hubei Province, China, 5.2% statin users compared 9.4% matched statin nonusers died cause. optional surveillance. apps want (for example facebook deleted Whatapp), turn whenever want sometimes turn days. Etc. demonstrated us vaccinated become spreaders without booster take it. point want booster offered. Good. mean that's valid question asking violate Paris climate accords Geneva convention. agree decision health care worker... 

I simply trust patients lie soon let people get relaxed choose follow zero guidelines. public health always gets blame irresponsible super spreaders.

Employers US discriminate whatever way desire long protected class. someone medical reason cannot vaccinated, protection. someone's natural immunity may strong vaccination illegal discrimination. not. don’t understand would omit current emрloyees vaccination requirement. lol Acting medical community ethics approval hasn’t changed last 40 years disingenuous well. thought show proof vaccination fly within US well Yes? Lots places like schools require vaccinations HPV, Meningitis, etc. Lots schools starting require covid vaccines, too. Nobody *forcing* take vaccine, missing lot take it.   kidding...

There's time place ethnicity matter treatment man using card hinder medical care pretty foul. Texas at-will employment state. fire parting hair wrong way. tried establish case heard immunity unrealistic, seem purposely omit glaring example: Israel.

Because juxtaposing statement policy hiring people vaccinated period would depend would ""reasonable accommodation"" Ada terms. probably getting downvoted question asked answered hundreds times day month.

It’s victim complex speaking right now. Oh we’ve got Alex Jones here. Humans animals don’t think killed tested on.

Not mention talking monolithic vaccine aren’t multiple vaccines. 

If it’s dangerous sort won’t problem anymore. Similarly it’s bad surely unvaccinated start businesses require unvaccinated employees.

Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* hospital system work in, flu shot required unless medical reason. different? work healthcare, get shot.   Masks practically nonexistent reduced even days. Source: upstate NY resident   bet they're simply required vaccinated. Probably company decided hassle/trouble/cost fire existing employee getting vaccination, especially they're union. easiest way understand healthcare professionals held HIPAA think companies started firing people vaccinated? shot bucko, seen economy lol Meanwhile, Spirit says hire unvaccinated workers make experience flying Spirit even worse. as? think anything I've written crazy I'm open shown otherwise Current ones exempt, yes. wonder union issues current contracts, matter, making so, decided would unfair hassle/trouble/cost worth make ruling existing employees. Uhhh, concert thing already done. Schools, sorts travel employers require proof vaccination. like decades, never noticed before. Lol yeah, teens mid-thirties went ton concerts festivals.

Ninja edit. reason never skip chance see foo fighters legit love fans put great show. Top notch guys. asked question answering questions hassle. 7/25 hit 70% according redditor crunches number every day. fluctuates every day though due decreased Joseph Robinette Biden Jr. shares first name middle name father, Joseph Robinette Biden Sr., passed away 2002 age 86.

The US implementing system tho right? EU allowing anyone US then? relying cards people got took shot easily faked? Absolutely, yes. virus know distinction! like requiring someone black work there, pure discrimination unvaxxed Wow, must really busy actually like band.   otoh someone super dumb overall specialized skills one area.  must have, cause Foo Fighters essentially Dave Grohl friends playing him. Dave played instruments first two albums. anyone know sign trial? Kids 12yo still vaccinate, vaccine 100% effective asymptomatic infection variant. I’m still bit concerned, though largely agree many would immediately exposed variants also reach vaccines. prefer get immunity naturally, that’s ok me. think worry digital system could result kind mission creep ends kind digital ID. I've got problem people knowing vaccination status, personally, want institutionalised.  [The Skeptic Society actually runs know everyone boat part group, though. Hesitancy low UK, offering stickers. Though, didn’t even get one 😭 totally missed point comment lmao  always confused people seem equate open date 100 percent vaccinated. 2 dose vaccines take month fully vaccinated. Government lying origins coronavirus absolutely nothing government lying numbers Coronavirus deaths.

I think one us biased. Looks like TX FL leadership running grenade population get brownie points. way going get mitigated corporate sector put foot (of appropriately leadership’s backsides) tell cut take balls operate elsewhere construction since 1866.  exactly true either, reddit removed first response why, even though short &amp; pretty basic. Big Foo Fighters fan, glad see   AMEN!! There's zero reason people without vaccine need take cruise. 

And cruise lines know can't afford another PR disaster comes multiple outbreaks. want 2 3 years line continued reputation they're unsafe. They're going protect bottom line. They're smart ban unvaccinated.  Thank you!!! That’s always say. Good argument Well, tho. Delta, considerably transmissible.

That's still debate. People made claims Alpha, kinds data Delta. See here: expect rural areas large portion people natural immunity now, hinted above. Likely liability thing lawyers told promising absolutely everyone would vaccinated 100% cargivers ans require vaccinated. world cannot bend one persons situation. would said problem one problem ""requirement general."" Outside general cost, goes vehicle documentation well.

There information add point, context nuance add answer. may proceed gotcha ""Aha, vaccine passports that, actually support them!""  vaccinated would get cruise require vaccinations.

Isn't ""require vaccinations"" show easily faked white cards picture card anyway? ways checking vaccinations used? 200,000 doses. C’mon Ohio democrats, we’ll need 2024! love them. Seeing Cincinnati July can’t freaking WAIT. Fckn illegal!! Ohio State Legislature? Good luck that. actually insane. they've effectively made choice get vaccinated point. We've full availability everyone ~2 months now. ""Almost every rural"" since smart, know ""other"" means different location, right? mean one who's educated state..... according you.

In city, used ""100%"" b/c superiorly educated people take things far literally. one control every single person does. Since literal though, I'd say 95% people wore masks timeframe provided. hope puts ease. understand trying dramatic stand soapbox acting like condescending twat I'm realist sorry like it.

You still said who, state, called hoax well. I'd like know info.

I also know shit comes telling people last line true, all. also funny think something like Dayton rural metropolitan area huge population trying sound smart nail point home I'll leave be. oh my. think restrictions going followed across America unless there's zombie-level resurgence. today, Texas exact law Galveston cruises doubt too.  rest world needs do. Big difference Canada UK 65% adults 40 got one shot Quebec another 10% appointment get it. Figures similar provinces. This. Make one set cruises vaccinated vaccine optional. Let free market sort out. course cruise line willing entertain compensate potential outbreaks liability charge accordingly repeatedly said vaccines need distributed globally based need, relevant developed vaccines.

Anyway rich mostly-white countries mass purchased vaccines places developed leaving global south, even we're OK kind vaccine nationalism (and I'm not), they're still using money cut line. haven’t seen vaccine stats doctors, imagine MUCH higher nurses. 

I’ve met *dumb* fucking nurses time. nurses legitimately think smarter work harder doctors. Pfizer booster today BC. Get vaccines, people.

If you, protect others. excuse point.

There myriad options transport -- including FREE rides vaccine location via Lyft. lot people vaginas wear briefs panties rides - reason. People penises seem comfortable bareassed bike seat, experience. That's article says dolt. honestly think argument ""disclosing private medical information"" hilarious. There's nothing private getting Covid vaccine. get US, 99% time, room full people. got mine mall stood line 300 people. nothing private fine that. I'm 100% fine anyone asking I'm vaccinated. I'm proud got mine got mine minute could. I'll tattoo lower back scan Covid vaccine tramp stamp care. like they're asking STD. They're asking ""were smart enough get vaccinated?"" resounding answer ""HELL YES!!!"" fully vaccinated individuals, we're okay.

But still [swaths rural vaccine uptake stalled 20-35%, well religious communities like [evangelical everywhere may even lower uptake. levels less half required herd immunity original variant (\~70%), much less Delta, considerably transmissible.

All would take Delta superspreading event next weeks Nashville Southern Baptist convention, Delta could climb [current 4.1% US (past 4 weeks) majority week. Even without event, US Delta prevalence tracking UK prevalence 6 wk delay: expect similar issues prevail impact vaccine hesitant communities mid-July. No, want know support requirement things like driver's licenses, car registration, liability insurance basic necessity. 

Again, different yoy ok yourself. ride organizers said chance chat since city's guidelines changed time being, they're “going stick initial mask guidance.” Lead organizer Wesley Noonan-Sessa said they'll keep eye city says next month so

Sounds like headline misleading like ""we gotten chance talk mask rule still place"" 

There's likely chance change think create split, absolutely thrived online instruction see need back classroom college level coursework. Others obviously struggled significantly, think see increase online offerings previously available alongside recognition many students person phased future. Sweden everyone gotten first dose August, September date assumes 100% uptake. realistic 90% uptake, enough vaccines give every willing adult two doses late August.

For real. even close simple. Especially bonds/currency great demand. Pat Smear made name 70s though. Great time move LA ports Seattle Yeah, thanks killing planet usage flights. There's hope treatments too. got handle HIV/AIDs end--we stop pandemic, discover effective treatments manage disease turn non-issue daily life. Hopefully next year we'll treatments make COVID-19 completely predictable easily managed disease--then even folks can't get vaccine much less vulnerable. can't really fathom goalposts get moved vaccines go full approval, rest assured moved. non-local GMOs  Props making work.

Bold assuming lol true. flip side, we're also missing Florida data daily reporting - bump get even bigger. 

Regardless, decline going flatten dramatically coming weeks. high vax states seen strong collapse cases (outside Washington/Oregon still ways fall), low vax states holding much steady - even increasing (like Alabama). That's probably CDC prohibited law making statement may used advocate promote gun control. Let's repeal law see CDC say. Anyone brain see gun violence public health issue, else would train teachers triage students shot school shooting? many countries teachers deal bullshit? That's messed up. state federal laws preventing share countries? You’ll fine. friend also probably fine — JJ isn’t good mRNA preventing asymptomatic mild cases still consider fully vaccinated.

If you’re uncomfortable always mask plan outside activities even current variants, good. feel really bad folks college high school this, 2019 grad. online school two semesters HATED it.

Wether foo fighters fan not, Dave's gonna bring it.  Yeah read article cruise ships right pandemic getting underway. ship floating environmental disaster.

And added bonus, floating petri dish staffed poor people exploited hell labor. add covid outbreaks sea mix like early days covid-19.

Wonder long first big outbreak occurs strands ship full people board weeks? silly look mass produced, mass provided vaccine given white people greater rates, administered often enough *by black nurses staff*, say ""actually, trick deployed directly *us* particular.""

That's difference. Black medical professionals caution skepticism. we're talking rational caution skepticism, conspiracy theory fresh coat paint. course. Scientists saying year. lots infections, deaths pain could avoided retrofitting schools enclosed spaces filters better ventilation. Yes is. Drastic found supporting evidence. wastewater research proves true

Get can. you’re still waiting second (like me!) keep masking cautious second dose kicks Thanks read, interesting knowing epidemiological, dystopian nightmare future ahead us. Perhaps roll then? Actually CDC said gun violence real issue Obama burried like results study asked for. Got tickets this. freaking excited   Where's Jolyne Hermes?  Wow I'm going go ahead assume health life insurance rates going go up, like smokers, sooner later. state legislature busy stipping Dewine pandemic response powers, forcing private companies require masks.

Our national legislature much better. Try reading article responding to. That’s good starting place. spirit, really hard.

I've seen spirit tickets often cost less half competitor, can't really see much complain about.

Think I’ve 6 foo shows now. lol okay, thank Yes. Many childcare workers prove shots thinking would fucking shame tried stop doctors appointments, sue illegal. Good. codified law. Businesses allowed make decisions minimize global pandemic casualties they're directly responsible for.

While we're thought exercise, imagine unvaccinated person dying unvaccinated employee spread coronavirus. Imagine payout lawsuit. imagine businesses allowed mandate vaccinations. do? Make vulnerable wrongful death lawsuit lawsuit, simply refuse serve unvaccinated people? Yeah seriously. Don’t require vaccines everything except flu shot right now? Vaxx records QR code actually. worry, going make wear one unless get vaccine. Wait saying banning someone Twitter isn’t first amendment???  I’ve lied right years…. Experts, people study shit. getting from?

Also, common sense rudimentary understanding vaccines immune systems. understand work? Ok, United Airlines first? getting information from? LIVE! about? You’ve stopped making sense. again, attempt coy analogy didn’t make sense either. 

A person patronize businesses *choose* comply businesses rules (like “no shoes, shirt, business). they? article states:

Good. prefer treated medical staff believe science. degree needed job effectively, vaccine isn't. isn't. Segregation vaccines reasonable makes sense, segregation skin color unreasonable makes sense. understand might easily understood I’ll repeat again: folks get vaccinated vaccines partially completely ineffective It’s free country guess   That’s true (cancelling lack profit)  Flight Ops probably departments airlines fully staffed. airlines seeing significant staffing shortages either coming months due higher expected demand. Nobody wants work anyway. I've completely stumped fact least afford hospital care likely avoid free vaccination. know county average GDP stats, I've also witnessed anecdotally.

The millionaires, doctors, lawyers, financiers know universally vaccinated whatever could get early.

My pool lawn guys refuse shots. even offered pull strings get early, wouldn't. guess ruined get sick, I'm going fire favor people potentially going infect family. hope realize percentage increase prevalence variant equal percentage increase number people infected. one variant rising, others falling. Therefore, prevalence stats tell little actual status population. There’s shitload ppl vaccinated got covid.. it’s denying science. fda approved I’m sure way different lot ppl  bad indignant making historical analogies. 

If better, convincing. stands, come kind idiot, ass boot. Poor combo ostensibly trying make point argument.  FWIW, passenger side there's glut flight attendants pilots b/c network cuts fleet retirements COVID (quite opposite pilot side compared pre-COVID really tough find pilots various reasons) 

What mean, mean something else like ""cargo side"" second use pilot  aren’t problem correlation isn’t causation. vaccine cause it’s incredibly rare type person needs protected herd immunity. lmao absolutely nothing whether states fabricating numbers, irrelevance makes obvious biased. talking ass.  vaccination used new form racist discrimination oppression minority populations - vaccine hesitancy running high, due historical reasons mistrust white centric healthcare system. Yes, confusion first 

But that's part ""what if?"" 

If addressed Covid airborne steps taken ventilation/filtration, since agreement last summer. policies really changing address that. inflight side, we're recruiting folks fast possible. there'd less backlash vaccines finished trials

And exactly vaccine complete phase 1, 2, 3 trials? It’s actually two days shots, per FAA. haven’t herd many airlines making difficult deal vaccine scheduling time afterwards, ones making difficult probably shitty airlines first place. many shots get? Found ""low skill"" worker  get point comment. feel like guy responding pro-choice. CDC director said based evidence, vaccinated people can’t transmit it. people disagreed   could totally see happening. really go extra mile make everything uncomfortable possible. keep puffing copium brother lmao  immunocompromised doesn’t mean can’t get vaccinated. clothes count forced compliance  it’s thing. term passport case means showing proof you’re vaccinated I’m sorry that’s true all, there’s another significant outbreak travel get slashed across board regardless whether individual airline responsible Yes. required tender proof vaccination immunity varicella, flu, hepatitis diseases can't recall moment company, shot expires. Whenever shot expires require get proof new one, case varicella give antibody count every years. Asian doctors overwhelming majority country vaccinated though. it’s currently 55% ADULTS US, unsurprisingly “blue” states higher vaccination rates knew it! David Hasselhoff behind entire thing!!! never trustef talking car, either.  dont mess texas!

heres long list things texas mess however places involved medicine refusing this? hospitals EMS agencies county requiring proof vaccination everything short assigning us appointments ourselves.  Pay generally reflects specialized replaceable position is. Spending four years learning accounting makes better accountant person cleaning toilets. 

Would hire bathroom attendant taxes? Yeah United cancels flights don’t sell enough tickets make profit. airlines won’t that. 

Also they’re ones got mad beat doctor years ago no, read wrote. medical facility needs written permission patient allowing happen. private property need follow rules allow health practitioners job. yes, would fine taking pictures, health practitioners could accused later allowing PHI dispersed without written authorization patient. could creating headaches breaking protocols place people things correctly go argumentative attitude right things without authorization. attitude initial statement shows entitlement something improper healthcare situation healthcare workers working extremely hard job following minutiae legal requirements.  read ADA instead making things Exactly. people use argument repeating talking point tell clearly zero idea talking about. Best luck getting pretty clear. cannot perform job well being. conclusively prove personal choices medical condition, sure!  Wtf. can’t think bigger waste time calling cousins’ hospital providers demanding know lab results. lyrics bottomless…

…

… Spirit marketing VP: mean cut costs much possible, get cheap flights changes depending job. plenty jobs require vaccinations Healthcare / Hospitals mandatory (Hep B amongst others). goes schools. mandatory vaccinations students need attend (MMR). 

It makes perfect sense people work field travels around globally interacts countless amounts passengers vaccinated respiratory virus highly contagious continuing evolve create variants. think otherwise would absolutely idiotic. can't say I'm verified post get yanked, 5 years ago seen enough people age bracket get shingles. decided pay vaccine pocket young covered. IIRC paid $350ish. airline government agency. freedom run business wish. ""mandate"" business decision. Oh definitely. Travel restrictions apply people, things like yellow fever here, employer requirements apply people, unless children school part apply either. Proud Boys, New York Hardcore chapter Sadly, affordable care act prevents think. law needs change paying stupidity some. Exactly. ones need vaccinated most. may declined without lottery. case much choice. would first 60% Americans. encourages stragglers. countries hit similar hesitation walls. Interestingly ER doctors supply issue well many people stopped coming COVID. would think multiple aboutevery vaccine existence. Matter money, said yourself. 
The problem rush, potential side effect beyond immediate effects recorded administrating?
Antibodies last 6 months Jag. Mine held extra 4 months reduced potency virus second round. Guess vaccine gives you, that's alright, I'll tell you- antibodies. hope antibodies well you. mean problem vaccines, took exposed enough virus create enough antibodies. 
On top that, scientists already found different mutations virus well yeah, even previous antibodies wont hold different strain. 
Vaccine not, still get sick. reason probably still healthy that, quarantine vaccine, still limiting often go such. case I'm fighting pay bills required leave home 7 days week last year+. There's lot stupid people internet, getting harder recognize satire way, esepcially confined spaces like aircraft definitely feel like they'll bigger impact actually will. Disregarding opinion vaccine; it’s Reddit filled bunch whiny bitches comment sincere question doesn’t conform preconceived opinion subject matter they’ll downvote you. makes feel big, like they’re someone special sitting high horse.  
There always mandatory vaccines schools such. What's ""forced compliance""? You... forced comply sorts public health safety things.   
Health dept, seat belts, headlights, fire codes, building codes...   
I think definitely gets excessive end vaccines make lot sense. people school said ""why need learn science class? I'm going use I'm older"" best! haven’t gotten back you, feel free ping remind lol hope people misusing trust benefit. Yeah, specific. Bad reporting Reuters. conversation doctor(s). help answer it. Glad you’re better corps owners CEOs thrived pandemic rest us make-do. relevant said Well...yeah can't adjust titles sub - posted Reuters did... looks OK, e.g. may have, get take well. people like need herd immunity. leading efforts get everyone else immunized!!

I’m sorry happened you. Yeah think bars using much events, definitely used:  Gotta love false dichotomy. Wow sucks. job offers paid time get vaccine, two shots. hours time. thought everyone getting benefit. imagine lot people PTO available.

Yet another good reason get vaccine. 100% watching squirm nice. Hopefully leads raise base wages people. Seeing mega corporations making record profits like Amazon buckle pressure nice. that's fear. I'm mend reaction. Theoretically better soonish. could get booster fall. I'm personally scared it. argue morally saying ""its rare.... can't happen right?"" 

But gone. 

I'm sorry point I'm venting fears worries. Maybe talk someone raise wages, people come? Seems like proletariat getting wiser.. know old joke, “What call person graduated bottom med school class?”

“Doctor”

I guess replace med school nursing school doctor nurse. prize stating obvious goes to... ""Dr. Michael Ryan"" extension protections biological sex. can't run business allows biological women wear dresses fires biological men thing. That's would attempt setting different standards people based sex, illegal discrimination. Well, *are* private business. like McDonald's requires employees wear uniforms. different, vaccines stop employees getting sick spreading customers.

Just imagine someone sues business getting sick one workers. Please do- I'm curious I've pointed out, baby already getting antibodies due fact covid somewhat recently still test positive antibodies. trust Dr date current research random redditors Except pertains Employer sponsored health plans provided care. HR HIPAA, site clinic etc hear. Sure, argument Covid vaccines similar flu vaccines way get vaccinated Covid stupid argument given information posted. sound like dumb fuck. gay aunt said, “if choice would choose this?”. partner went electro shock therapy 70s part conversion treatment.   Definitely low skill labour, also 4 yr degree, many people going business &amp; psychology experience tend decent people, right point racist/sexist/homophobic stuff. rarely overt in-your-face things anymore, there's definitely ton micro aggression behavior everywhere. 

I've lost several relationships thinking ""this person learn, let point XYZ okay"". they're ready hear perfect. 

I recently learned race covenants regarding property ownership Oregon. Absolutely ridiculous. Plenty speculation sources. know long vaccine efficacy lasts. Could year, could 10 years, could lifetime. don’t know. that's said

Go back up, mentioned Dr's advice either right away immediately following comment. think got careful- double masks, one vent (yes filtered replaced filter every couple months), Clorox wipes gloves wherever went (and used too- anything touched got cloroxed including elevator buttons washing machine buttons on), anytime got cash would let sit 72 hrs using it, much life possible contactless target drive amazon fresh kept youngest home sitter absolutely needed get stuff done around house around December time. social distanced see parents siblings much, let alone anyone else pandemic either. go prayer services even outdoor year, even Rosh Hashanah Yom Kippur. everything said, got unlucky enough catch anyways. maybe next time make snap judgement someone based little info 26,000 businesses largely desperate work want pay living wage. 
Better title - Napa County records first death fully vaccinated person age 65 underlying health conditions COVID-19 went lunch break Tuesday went back work sore arm. Wednesday Thursday fatigued bed day body aches headaches. Friday crashed around 2pm fever. lost 2.5 days PTO it. I'm good, imagine lot people PTO available. Ok restricted entry quarantining. Despite nitpick overall point still stands. mildly elevated risk. JJ vaccine uses adenovirus vector it’s likely multiple adenovirus shots body make antibodies adenovirus making vaccine inert. also still wearing masks, statewide mask mandate still effect 100% followed SF Bay Area. I’m normally pretty cautious things, yeah…the UK logged one death today. One. India’s case count plummeting ridiculous rate. media clearly grasping revenue.  Aiee, supposed ***insert*** name, ***tell*** everyone it!

Now know! think better headline would “Some New Yorkers”. 

Tons New Yorkers celebrating/going due lessening Covid-19 concerns. political before.    
And main vaccines common long, get kid, probably never think again... covers pretty much everyone basic education right every child too... conniving whore!   shut stupid booster talk it’s demonstrated vaccine efficacy fades? “Seven new variants kill everyone love. won’t believe number three!” That’s happens mental capacity toddler.  Use Authorization FDA approved. 

It authorized go production approved use. link provided literally explains that. 

You arguing reality. COVID vaccines FDA approved. great example US military. US military makes service members get manner vaccines. COVID, that's still optional.

And FDA, walnut. [The military suffering call make mandatory, dragging asses.

The institution *still* uses troops guinea pigs qualms due arbitrary pedantry. US military enforce COVID vaccine gets approved FDA.

It **already approved use**. dragging ass Biden giving order. [He letting make acting like vaccines similar authorization mandatory past. Stop lying. *Please*. Nice! current employees! Trades staring future labor shortages cause shuffled everyone 4 year college route two decades. ...this isn’t new thing 🤦‍♂️  Masking zero consequence intervention either. What's sensory sensitive kids deaf kids? Autistic kids? Kids moved hard time meeting friends.

My child mild hearing loss really struggles two afternoons week district offers person class.

Masking best vaccination, zero harm. comment made mention relative America. said got swamped COVID. objectively true like America did. discussing vaccine facebook group registered nurse literally arguing ‘believing’ vaccine. people use word ‘believe’ like faith religion? science, backed data prove vaccine works. don’t realize level stupidity. baffles me. Explain what’s false law abiding citizens countries re: Coronavirus. informative. Thanks insight. could employers demand see medical records hiring you? Debt based mental health records, diabetes, etc? goalposts moved exactly? I'm saying going multiple opinions person gets one think right literally definition following science. Yeah could go either way see potential problem want (new) people going public safety heart. Air travel safety core tenant, means safe operating procedures planes, also public health safety. There's 100% effective vaccine age group 204 kids hospitalized winter. Debate pretty much done metrics. Fights covered federal law, supercedes state law, issue. UA airline tell desantis pound sand, meekly say okay. shit vaccines adverse reactions?? know else likely hurt you? Covid. Treat people like people, tend show respect loyalty.  Quick question. fall HIPAA laws. employer ask vaccine answer? country option get AZ vaccine yes, I'm worried blood clots part. I'm 30F. option wait indefinitely Pfizer. Idk tbh. That's mostly teens innate immunity flu. put novel flu population similar stats.

I signed kid ASAP covid vaccination like every winter flu vaccination. Glad covid vaccine effective.  think we're close full employment. still charged private hospitals cap 150 admin charges. Cost anywhere 700-1k Fucking morons Seriously. Getting bit mosquito hurts more. Canada basically every job I’ve required vaccinations lol. one wants Typhoid Mary workplace It’s dilemma. Donate doses. No. Companies unions, like United, can't arbitrarily fire people getting vaccine existing union contracts. Lots anti-vaxers United. It’s type people go field. People aren’t afraid get hands dirty manual labor generally aren’t afraid getting sick. It’s relatively dangerous field imagine types people enjoy it, people don’t mind little risk. know em know em, don’t don’t can't speak Australia there, however states companies want pay workers labor. vaccines many immune going washed kids happen again.

With effective vaccines covid vaccination heavily favoring secondary conditions- flu may well deadly kids winter.  Lol, old kid? expensive state school country less $20k per year. headline misleading. We'll still charged private hospitals. Government centers free that's it. Interviews say, well comfortable feel in-person interview? Ok, in-person interview going sign waiver pandemic, ok that? STILL unsure say ""We conscious company employees. care everything despite waiver make feel comfortable make sure wear mask also.""

If tell immunized point, immediately know vaccinated. need go further, time ghost them. really hope there's ways people medical reasons able vaccinated whatever reason accommodated way. There's bound handful 1 500'000 whatever reacts known vaccines. simple: People want job United job requiring vaccine? Show basic bare minimum social courtesy getting vaccine public safety.

It's proven lessen symptoms also reduces transmission rates, compared unvaccinated people. Boat pulls dock...is unloaded reloaded people already land...boat leaves again. many people enter exit country?

Canada’s border US sees something like 30,000 “essential” vehicles crossing daily. Trucks carrying goods, instead boats. people live one side work other. many people enter exit country?

Australia doesn’t trucks workers crossing borders daily. ADA requires reasonable accommodation, get jail free card. reasonable accommodation made, let go/not hire you. job requiring contact hundreds members public breathing recycled air, I'd apt say that's reasonable. someone desk. Jimmy Johns near closes randomly depending staffing levels. Nuts Valid. Thanks viewpoints information good, fuck parakeets   Cool beans. Glad hear it.  204 adolescents whole country 4 months eligible vaccine. survived. situation greatly improved US.

That article good lesson mislead using statistics.  first trials year ago. long-term effects vaccines would become apparent now, any.

How much time take satisfy people?  **dreamed** finally able say discriminated against. allow Canadians move freely around country. exceptions, right nothing stopping flying Vancouver Calgary, Regina, Toronto, Montreal. believe Ontario plans remove provincial border checkpoints less two weeks, BC’s internal restrictions supposed gone around time. welcome win intelligence! people states still wearing masks occasionally, even cases going dramatically? curious learn mask wearing become common pandemic? bet people exception could walk maskless stores like Costco Trader Joe’s. People still wear masks outdoor around walking completely alone want know dr david dao thinks this. waiting airline come saying wont give shit. company travel them. course dime, whatever cheapest. Interesting. CDL HazMat license $150k/year job many places California right now. TM occurs sporadically rate several cases per million people per year, think know causes those.  unless vaccine causing rate higher this, valid infer vaccine caused it, even can't finger cause.

I agree others probably contraindication getting another vaccine. Better safe sorry. infected pathogen would also kind natural vaccine (it's pumping full antigens, all) come COVID lookout TM coming back. Prevalence stats tell reproductive rates variants though, previous comment about.  ones know hesitant young kids even though it’s statistically dangerous kids, still careful since kids can’t get vaccinated. 

I’m things, I’m judging people point, still think slow roll helped keep numbers here. Hip? Hip-Hop? Hip-hop-anonymous? board unemployed? choice affect hundreds personal choice. could work anywhere United States right now, it’s bad. Perhaps doctor. Or, likely, already doctor. new variants also reduce vaccine efficacy, number needed vaccinate reduce R 1 also increased.. Fucking good. want vaccinated crew, that’s extra $59 charge. 117 doctors administrators role? think that's true kids 12, 12 spread effectively adults many work part time jobs clustered sports schools. 

12 need vaccinated keep variants forming country schools stay open. Teens vaccinated younger children two separate issues.

The amount vaccines vaccinate 12 low enough makes delay getting world. mean true, plan work flight attendant reason. lot jobs leaning towards requiring wanted put broader hypothetical there. non-Christian ones well, Mount Sinai health system NY, affiliated Judaism.

“Smiles smugly everyone gasps” would killed route like trucker. 
Even ""home every day"" driver 'start 5:30am, home around 10pm' deal.  
And paid $12/hr (~2010) many laws apart HIPAA HR department deal with. Even non law covers it, still disclose disclosing open liability information misused.  think temporary issue vaccines new people skeptical them. can't compare flu MMR vaccine used long time. Im partially vaccinated Tuesday, pro-vax, encouraged skeptical friends get vaccinated understand coming from. think given enough time people go get vaccinated. Ive known several people family going get fully vaccinated. Imagine: businesses already given free passes thing workers/people real repercussions/hurdles put place states.

You imagine hard; reality, already.  Can't spell Spirit without P T. No-body-knows. labor shortage trades, pay shortage. trade jobs cut 20 years life span result huge medical costs, top many times requiring large collection personal tools along truck means transporting often construction materials. $16 hour education may sound good first, extra $2 another non labor intensive job worth decades life? even actually cover extended costs employment tradesmen? cover inevitable bust boom nature trades work?

Often answer no. Plenty skilled tradesmen still leaving fields pay make cons. Especially people around replaced ever lower lower bottom barrel candidates. one competent people team construction workers fun earn anything extra unless entire business, requires massive investment younger tradesmen have. rather somebody know HIPAA laws miss acronym. acronym stupid made up. stands also made stupid. private business asking proof vaccination stupid, made up, law. airline us use PTO it, much accrued happy use up, called whole trips vaccinations. Nice break work. didn’t use occurrence, didn’t count anything far many call outs anything. clarify international friends, hospitals US often named churches (methodist, presbyterian, baptist, etc) case catholic church saints (saint jude, saint paul, saint mary, etc) since ones founded started hospitals much Europe. difference remained privately owned operated rather government ran, kept name. 

While religiously affiliated hospitals right offer services might like (such abortions) since decades they've transferred ""religiously affiliated"" religiously ran.

The point everyone works member church even religious, goes patients.

As walk itself, strangely ironic considering church setup Houston methodist response Spanish flu pandemic. downplayed second opinion, move goalposts now.

This common, science, including medical science works. That's know. serious question would get labeled anti-vax USA. 15 year old got vaccinated show stand issue.

However, Fall they're deciding whether vaccinate 5 year olds emergency use authorization, really question benefits kids. enough benefit around get fast tracked. FDA hurdle must crossed. I’m sure speculation haven’t seen data immunity degrades vaccine. Nobody knows. Absolutely nobody. times, exactly deal real news. garbage paper imo. go lower east side 7 pm, yeah new yorkers totally afraid... I’m glad googled pay upgrade new strains come out.  It’s almost like we’re talking state California, place USA. seem really type bunch nothing. compared California states. never mentioned countries comparison. So, sub's infiltrated anti-mask Republican morons. Cool. Would anyone mind pointing tolerant coronavirus sub people brain-dead? Anyone? Pick number, let's go.  country citizens shout rights constitution every day willingness government control passports vaccinations startling. dumbasses tell “my body choice” 

Unfortunately, already understaffed, can’t fire 40% staff believes Facebook PHD accounts saying covid vaccine make homosexual democrat Went craic weekend. before. awesome. Hispanic you’re telling first time Im experiencing it? tHeYrE gOnNA kIlL gRaNdMa! I’d get it’s vaccine undergone extremely scrutinized testing period history. Insane EEOC allows discrimination discrimination based HIV status.  Ah, know used viruses not. That's good know. got shot, pretty heavy anti-vaxer friends talking to. largest concern long term effects. [Case: 1a : set circumstances conditions statement true three cases b(1) : situation requiring investigation action (as police) disappearance case police. (2) : object investigation consideration child's case turned state pertinent two sub-definition (B) (C)

Anything regarding government involves cases. citizen documented filed folder multiple case files. go taxes, case file filled happens review process, get postage checked, case file opened show medical record done, possibly routine check possibly concerned may cancer. Depending severity medical condition go get checked case file (pretext) investigated. 

Example, mri shows tumour growth, case file opened possibility cancer. doesn’t mean cancer, doesn’t signify stage type cancer have, even do, case file investigating cancer opened. 

For covid-19 go get tested covid, opening case file medical record. record investigate/conclude Corona virus. 

A “confirmed case” poor wording. It’s like saying “confirmed homework assignment” doesn’t actually reflect nature is. Would “confirmed homework assignment” mean it’s confirmed finished homework? Would mean it’s confirming received homework? don’t know context, medical cases know work. “confirmed case” means, confirmed case file open investigation covid. back up, precisely you’re even able part medical documentation system. testing covid receive result later, possible? testing CASE file updated medical practitioner open CASE file call give results. confirmed case saying, yes confirmed investigation open covid potential. 

It doesn’t matter test negative positive, case medical record permanently. It’s like doctor follow health condition. Like example may went pain chest, go back 3 months later doctor pulls case files sees “a yes sir 3 months ago pain chest, rated 4/10 pain prescribed pain, doing?” Case files never disappear, always “confirmed case” covid choose get tested. inclusion “contract tracing” numbers actually inflated without even getting testing, name location put category assume covid near someone “infected”. 

It’s reason may received emergency alert you’re area potential tornado. government resources track identity location make assumptions regarding safety. see John Doe live x region x region covid hotspot add John Doe covid list assuming worst. It’s hardly conspiratorial, it’s poor system haphazardly put place effort reducing spread covid identifying potential infections get hand, Thai really unjustly target certain regions inflate numbers making covid seem worse is. 

And let’s talk pcr testing. YouTube video views supposed official understanding pcr testing works. literally states video (and multiple others care look) pcr test “detect” tiny amount covid body, use pulmonary chain reaction multiple covid cells exponentially order able test covid. this? may say “it’s need identity covid it’s serious” may fair point. pcr tests used abusive. It’s taking healthy people sign true infection, minuscule amounts, concluding asymptotic sick need quarantined. 

You may think covid capacity means you’re sick, asymptomatic, whatever else, you’re wrong. Throughout history carriers multiple foreign bodies. human body actually foreign cells human cells didn’t know. rudimentary look this. exploring “what kind symbiotic organism fictional character Venom is, youtuber details much living symbiotic life form, foreign cells gut bacteria colony cells. look this. people recommend probiotics yogurt stuff like that, keep gut bacteria fed healthy stuff. Quite literally need feed foreign cells body keep keeping us healthy. 

Covid, something looking improve body, magically going kill everyone around present. face lives thousands tiny parasites eat dead skin cells, moment. foreign, don’t hurt even though literally living body. Covid like anything, present short duration, leave. Especially immune system seems dangerous. 

NEEDING tested pcr proof covid fact serious, like exam ken cyanide risen poisoning (both organic poisons deadly human life, even tiny amounts) compared cyanide, covid joke. infection, pint trace amount cyanide kills you, trace amount covid doesn’t. no, trace amount logically spread. 

Know we’ve modern human history get sick? stay home, sweat, cough, sneeze bathe, got shower, soup, self isolation practises, it’s benefit others well. sick runny nose, sneezing, coughing asymptotic carriers. trying redefine asymptomatic covid, aren’t sick. aren’t infected enough sick yourself, infected enough transmit covid? It’s illogical. LITERALLY isn’t enough covid present body covid even taken toll health, spread, multiple infect another person barely even colonized body? That’s viruses work, covid isn’t super virus, would need infect person faster, you’d need illness day two even remotely close super virus. 

When younger family members going school, often they’d bring home flu bug get sick. work, travel, association anyone would never get sick, living someone gotten bug, bug hitchhiked immunity similar mine blood relation making easier infect me. even notion keep household infected ridiculous. don’t get well staying cooped household people may sick. Especially forced live household months guise public safety. Health doesn’t come staying inside, comes going building immunity. 

What call asymptomatic people, actually people meant build societies herd immunity. vaccines, power human immune system. Vaccines needed person unwell immune system doesn’t function correctly. That’s it. Basic science vaccine company approved FDA. approved time. liability side effects caused vaccine. It’s frustrating. seem article better information score eventually. Methotrexate reduces immune response 38% patients, according one published study far, it’s guaranteed bad result. vaccine side effects vary pretty wildly even among healthy, really can’t assume based mild reaction versus others know. someone pneumonia drug pre-COVID, say extra precautions definitely important get point know sure protect immune compromised. intubated absolutely sucks. pro vax even wont go near J&amp;J one. airlines change policies exclude potential employees life threatening diseases, HIV? Surely right employer. Gonna go limb say bookings decrease saw bunch cancellations therefore reversed policy. sail 2020 desperately need make money back. downvoted people think change things, downvoted incorrect. fact vaccines authorized EUA exactly zero relevance legality vaccine requirements.

There legitimate questions employer vaccine mandates, mostly around handle accommodation requests due sincerely held religious beliefs. might legal terminate employee claims religious exemption willing submit requirements, like mask wearing increased testing.

But EUA issue complete red herring, [the EEOC vaccine authorized use, employers (in absence exception) require it. one believe science immunity. vaccination necessary. afraid cough go ahead take vaccine EUA fully tested. probably poor health begin afraid covid. Even so, covid would minor harm you. small bug. Vaccines necessary, victim mass hysteria fear. mother used teach nursing school. would recommend ton students take basic math classes community colleges trouble things like calculating fluid ins outs. statistics, basic arithmetic. Exactly plan do. never even owned passport begin See, vaccine requirement cruise something support 100%. I’m worried well-being vaccinated person, unvaccinated nitwits spread ship, there’s serious outbreak, vacation they’re gonna turn boat around get nitwits hospitals.

This situation vaccine mandate logical necessary. intentionally manipulated lab family member Methotrexate Humira got antibody test. antibody levels thousands! Unless union state Jerry longer good enough the. must become Jerry Ryanair announced charge additional $96 surcharge wish fly unvaccinated. also need purchase plastic bag put head additional $9.99. Ladies gentlemen…

Foo FIGHTers. can't lack knowledge reddit. crime  exist ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ really ""rushed"". mRNA vax first theorized 70s tech time good enough efficiently make it. started trials back start 2020 covid-19 clinical trials showed worked. spike proteins chemically identical ones released actual virus (your body magically know whats it) creates exact antibodies fight virus...

... Plus, know.... fact cases death counts fallen cliff since people vaccinated (in countries gotten enough doses)   happens said employee gets sick outside home country

Well they'll probably get free healthcare treated like actual human being, pretty neat. Unless already employee. trial might start scratch product updated variants, live attentuated vaccines risk.. start attentuating process variant, that's essentially new product, updated one..
 
I might wrong though.. notworthy points press conference: 


Dejan Kulusevski already Covid reinfection.

He tested positive PCR-test last thursday low levels virus took antigentest new PCR-test witch negative considered infected played start saturdays match Armenia.

The players days ""bubble"" supposed infected time. Maybe photo shoot commercial. Wait unvaccinated segregation areas sporting events get going full swing. D'aaaawwwww parakeet ever :O I'm watching NBA playoffs arenas packed. happening already? I'm US know what's up. unwashed masses Reddit.

Umm, took shower last week ya jerk! Nah. I’ve said 100 times I’ll say again: exclusively personal accountability issue now. Hospitals aren’t threatened overrun anymore. Get vaccinated safe, don’t get vaccinated and....don’t safe. it’s time return 2019 life stop punishing done right thing.

I’d buy tickets show NYC wouldn’t think twice it. also question timing. Infections going down, many already vaccinated. good environment get good stats in. Savage    Can't certain employees get fired case upload vaccination documentation making can't survive due job? I'm sure states situation states could allow employee sue? I'm brainstorming believe we've waited long enough winter here. reckon might alright somehow family businesses pays $8 minimum wage front desk help. That's 2x minimum state. literally folding clothes helping customers. Cant find anyone! Hired custodian week, (paying double minimum wage) dude left hour asked break boxes. even say thing. got truck left.

I know business owners local groups dealing thing. Paying way minimum wage still takers. sad! personally think I'd fit better Onion, sucks use hiring pool :D  cool. guess Phish busy something? Thank you! knew day matter said. vaccine got reaction. course that's reasonable. 

There people can't specific jobs can't lift lot. Maybe can't job need internationally travel can't vaccinated properly. sucks that's it.

At end day - may exact problem got COVID well - rare cases due covid - potentially AZ vaccine end - doctor question mRNA vaccines completely different mechanism action.  face value, though, doesn’t seem downright normal enforce administration drug hasn’t fully approved?

...not midst global pandemic killed hundreds thousands US. Risk assessed relative terms. completely reasonable employer mandate use authorized vaccine greatly lowers risk employee themselves, every employee, patients hospital. wouldn’t assume loud minority represents silent majority: us fed tired ridiculous non-sequiteur anti-vax full well prepared let Darwin step heavy lifting. 

Another vaccine keep job safely (for others) another many little sufferings takes become doctor. 

The hospital fire them. mean? need stay bunker forever safe thought vaccinated people didn’t need wear masks. risk transmission infected negligible. Yes battle Hippomatux courthouse. thing garbage trump lover won’t get vaccinated.
Hundreds millions already got vaccinated. Yeah definitely viable short supply. It’s something realistically depend getting.

I trial program AZ’s version. Two shots butt. Ah yes remember vividly chapter mRNA vaccines creating spike proteins regards SARS virus 6th grade science book. Tell Copernicus, think repercussions rushed trial vaccine are, explain creating spike proteins body effects body. would love basic logical explanation!  Yep. always throw mine morning driving work. pocket forget put I'm halfway desk cause I'm running auto-pilot.   reasons aren’t convincing enough, else left really say” ?

Source: I’m airline pilot major.   new term now?

"" Community transmission "" 😆 Fuck Frontier Spirit. Frontier airline straight ruin week talk like I’m asshole booking them. Good news! first drawing tomorrow! get topsoil get first 250k ill happy trade!   link proves state fact.

Calling concern trolling name calling. Hell, even ""merely...""


Go away, walnut. government incentivize businesses pay reducing unemployment benefits. Let’s take endless billions military budget give back Americans actually need it. Uhhh healthcare ever labor shortage... sure entire statement??? makes recommendations based science.

It came defensive gun use. None government depts. credibility anymore decade more. Daycare workers required multiple vaccinations yes, employers require proof vaccination. Plus don’t even factor california people less cases. texas florida. High school education minimum, experience customer service desired. Bank teller needed position, higher positions need filled too. know large company, marketing recruitment completely separate individual locations. know pre-covid ~75 applicants per position less 15. There’s nothing wrong asking doctor’s note. You’re lucky haven’t caught deceiving yet. guys brag survive. Considering nurses likely die repeated exposure infection risks could endanger critically ill patients stupidest shit ever heard. Yep friends brewery kitchen staff starts $18 hour health insurance . able staff mandates lifted like week two.  shortage applicants. Exactly 👍 businesses forced government pay that's stand. business need pay more. Maybe government finds way incetivise businesses pay more? How? Even taking every precaution possible, death disease everywhere. I'm sick stuck inside world dangerous. go employee’s doctor doctor handed info, violation occurred.

And that's whenever job asks doctor's note, print own. even pay people they're worth, that's system stable rich countries long while.

Then dum fucks figured could take more, more, more. whole system private capital bursting seams. Whoa, hey I'd want topsoil.

I've got like 14 raised beds need dirt free dirt free dirt :(

^(Actually, tbh I'd anything free stuff general nevermind...) That's good question, research know better explain answer question. meantime, suggesting there's difference? think difference would two different categories.

If rush get vaccine (and I'm saying support vaccine) might known Johnson &amp; Johnson blood clot release. Note FDA update EUA warning blood clot issue. Certain things would definitely skipped due emergency situation found in. think somebody flies Spirit money big SUV? No, isn't... And, we're it, many businesses going endanger lives 1% unvaccinated people actual legitimate reason getting shot juat dumb employee wants work without following corporate policy plenty others will. 

Work right. People choose apply work anywhere want they've got follow rules business requires follow. not, go get fucked. Simple that. actually untrue. majority jobs healthcare LTC Hospitals decided government. many unemployed nurses major cities working non nursing positions government limits spots bare minimum. 

They could easily fill spots cared so. difference relying others vaccinated *want* vs *can't* vaccinated produce adequate antibodies vaccination. don’t know talking about. 

Employers can’t force disclose PHI. 

They ask vaccination status, free either choose disclose it, find employment elsewhere. Either choice voluntary. It’s outdoors, doesn’t matter anyway. Outdoor transmission extremely extremely extremely rare. australia went hard lockdown far less cases. Meanwhile, taiwan's issues testing, vaccines, hospitals. Apparently 4 level system they're everything power go 4th level. extended 3rd level instead.

Not saying full blown disaster yet. anyone see response proportional explosive cases been. problem public health is... public. fair take actual actions account. stll, case, extensive scientific litersture supporting fact vaccines don’t work?

Oh, definitely not. person talking totally incorrect. criticizing wrong thing. That's I'm saying. opinion facts?

By either thinking case thinking case. Statements facts *and* opinions. lot people erroneously taught dichotomy fact vs. opinion statements always categorized one (and maybe happened school). that's wrong. dichotomies truth (i.e. fact) vs. untruth belief (i.e. opinion) vs. disbelief. One reality person's brain. 

""The Moon exists"" fact. also opinion shared essentially every person. ""The Moon exactly 6 kg massive exactly 2 billion years ago today"" *might* fact. is, one believes is, one's opinion. We'll probably never know sure. (And definitely one ever care.) Opinions like ""the reptilian aliens control government"" ""the COVID-19 vaccines work"" facts. things neither opinions *nor* facts. Like bizarre wrong statements arithmetic using large numbers one's ever thought before, ""1234567 + 1000000 = 2234568"". one believes also true. four combinations possible. live, places hire $11/hr. That's improvement. enhanced unemployment absolutely reason many people aren’t looking job, that’s problem. problem wages expect earn go work. companies want workers, pay unemployment does. Florida announce releasing covid numbers anymore? misled. Yes agreed got Why? didn’t say don’t count, absolutely do! also agree it’s 100% effective. point added context helps read headlines also felt bit vague help generate clicks vs informative. Oops oh well requirements applicants? What’s job for? well company marketing job? comment impressive big picture really Amazon? mean Walmart right? immunocompromised people indeed protected class. 

That's true. pregnant spread pregnancy others. even try compare two absolutely related things other?

If vaccinated, protected, matter unvaccinated gets COVID. sub really tough time understanding this. person gets sick, office. Similarly, woman gets pregnant, also office, disrupting productivity.

Both end costing company money, similar. One happens protected class, one happens be. pointing hypocrisy picking choosing randomly protected class.  magically problem never before?  even Sweden's case target everybody offered first dose early month, namely Sep 5.

Sweden also likely least weeks later EU countries due combination high uptake (up 90% wants take vaccine) lower supply AstraZeneca Janssen used. Well I've bartended neighborhood years, everyone go Williamsburg bars also employees Williamsburg bars, consensus among us much returned normal, besides labor shortage. Go rocka rolla Saturday night see maskless crowds door, shoulder shoulder bodies packed inside 4am. Ah. Fair enough. I’m la. although people know masking up, lot people partying year 0 precaution. What’s long term proven medical science?  Send Canada, we'd glad them. Though, maybe exact Brazil needs urgently Good. I'm spending amount time sealed metal tube people, much prefer everyone vaccinated, tested flight.  referring CDC survey, I'm sure point trying make since believe CDC made specific policy recommendations regard, although believe should. Gun violence public health problem much public safety issue. Why?   Trains suck Europe too. 240 Euros 22 hours travel time stopping every tiny little town 40 Euros hour RyanAir. That's easy choice. wound major news story. covered? 

“I heard anonymous stranger Reddit” isn’t religious exemptions originally talking about. Goal posts keep Changing get made stories. Probably sent AZ doses, amounts small. Biden declared “the light end tunnel actually growing brighter brighter.” Restaurants bars reopening full capacity, flights crammed people excited finally take postponed vacations reunite relatives. August, planning march New York City raise awareness, calling public officials others wear yellow hearts reminder fallen ill died. Selvi Clark Gaithersburg, Md., said understands people’s eagerness resume pre-covid activities, even though husband Casey, 47, CIA officer, died January contracting virus duty abroad. don’t. also implies receiving country accept tests fast instant. know several countries still make people quarantine even negative test upon arrival. would also rather robust testing facility boat potentially thousands people trying get one day port. doesn’t seem feasible. 

Goodness knows though. mean day-to-day basis choose I'm vaccinated impact restrictions. want go back gym. Kinda hoping cruise lines aren’t willing sensible, companies provide travel insurance be. Test costs required treatment/quarantine/medical evacuation pocket people insist refusing Yet still slow response . SA teacher here. teaching countries closed down. Taught covid. choice. work pay. 

Got excited vaccine got developed. . . colleague die today covid still havent vaccinated. 

Doesnt matter much money people invest doesnt seem make difference. funds mismanaged gets stolen. 

I hope companies donate money keep track spend. seriously want vaccine dont fear life lives learners. 

At rate country rolling vaccine reach herd immunity 10 years. 

I really feel president trying best way many sharks surround him.  They'll throw plane lmao people offended discrimination experiencing first time. Suddenly fun happens them

They discriminated against, facing consequences. Big difference.  Yes, actually. ordered provide cakes same-sex couples. really look more, it’s interesting case. I'm sure true. work concerns HIPAA even though far removed healthcare. hope kept walking unemployment line.  Defensible discrimination.

If people insisting getting vaccine personal choice okay, that's fine, deal consequences choice. employer example requiring masks vaccinated workers actually requiring people prove vaccinated remove mask anti-vaxxers pissed want benefits vaccines also refusing get one themselves. Send elsewhere, don’t need blood clotting vaccines. took Pfizer FWIW No. Either don’t understand math purposely spreading misinformation.

Based data, worst peak infections, 2.1 every 100,000 12-17 year olds hospitalized Covid infection. That’s 0.00002 0.002%. 0.002% hospitalized, 1/3 go ICU. 1 150,000 adolescents ended ICU. 1 1 million adolescents required mechanical ventilation. 0 adolescents died associated Covid infection. forcing non fda approved vaccine seem normal. dumb argument... realize hospital systems required get vaccines jobs? different. 

Also getting vaccine means risk patients. everything goes way want, patients opt different nurses vaccinated? sucks. I've phenomenal experiences them. Literally never better service. One time plane mechanical issue, let us board another plane scheduled take two hours later delayed. time, original plane fixed neither delayed hour.

Air Canada hand terrible. layover Montreal go Toronto. pilots. Montreal one hubs. literally would faster take train Montreal Toronto wait. took seven hours get pilots play outside shows summer.  Trey playing first indoor show weeks Beacon though.  probably right there's immediate danger, inconceivable think variant could bring trouble \*certain\* parts US. Case numbers going everyone likes act pandemic forever, fact matter plenty states, vaccine uptake anywhere near enough real herd immunity. consider apparent seasonality virus combined 40% extra transmissibility variant, could problem fall winter. US certainly needs keep pushing vaccinate many people happens. Per Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) used collect reports adverse events vaccination general public. primarily used identify potential topics investigate regards vaccine reactions. However, event data VAERS often verified often self-reported, assumed adverse events VAERS actually associated cause vaccines, possible estimate frequency adverse events data.

Believing fringe conspiracy theories isn’t protected class, religion, race, gender sexual orientation. It’s choice.

“The CDC says investigated 4,000-plus reports death Covid-19 vaccines May 10 found “causal link” Covid-19 vaccine, though “recent reports indicate plausible causal relationship between” Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine “rare serious adverse event—blood clots low platelets—which caused deaths.” 

Vaers “is simply system people report bad things happen vaccination, whether events caused vaccine,” Dr. William Moss, executive director International Vaccine Access Center Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School Public Health, told covid, first symptoms experiencing, exposed least 5 days ago, almost 2 weeks ago.

It's much likely reacting vaccine. free before? issue becomes whether eat employer provided meals essential function job. going fly considering there's food pretty much every airport flight attendants frequently eat places

And narrowing facts much. food allergy helpful illustration necessarily kind disability would implicated suggest test whether high work?

Certainly current cannabis tests show THC present even test intoxication. test intoxication sounds like employer problem problem. Link? lockdowns. Literally one US ever locked down. fine print, also case information *not* stored electronically, covered. right whole symptoms part, ship outbreak unvaccinated people board, stuck quarantined floating prison.

I'd get board cruise vessel exposes risk. Ryanair charge extra flight crew vaccinated. Netherlands invited 33 year olds today go one two years per day expected mid July every 18+ vaccine. certainly case EU.

Actually don’t know single country expect Sweden set September aim adults offered first dose. Reminder: applies health care facility disclosing information, keep electronic records. facility keeps paper records disclose information want. logic lost Reddit. It’s amazing many people problem people losing livelihood frontlines whole time. fact vaccine isn’t fda approved sort long term side effect data think valid reason hesitant covid vaccine. agree problem first second points irrelevant. UK US level fully vaccinated, UK ahead first doses. 

Yes, UK sticking age order strictly (mostly due people willing vaccinated), really matter spread. could argued reason hospitalizations flat precisely point one, vaccinating older groups higher risk first, must choose one, UK strategy likely better. 

Yes, although UK longer gap doses, % fully vaccinated same. see tracks plausibly US could pull ahead shorter gap, US doses trending down, probably not. 

This mean problem US UK wave lead anything substantial though, much reason worry. far know september ""all EU would offered vaccine""  Paris, Texas! Probably either proof vaccination negative test result. implies test centre on-board though... assertion assumes cases continue rise indefinitely, seeing lower spread groups vaccinated. 

To clear - disagree cases increase hospitalisations deaths course increase, key point link two seen Wave 2 severed - meaning need far cases reach levels hospitalisation death. vaccine passports totally hear you. 

Notice included prior infection comment. anywhere 100m people either massive wave least measure vaccination? fair employee... purpose. want pay claims, easy way circumvent that. Also... they're private company, they're *allowed* deny employment reason want long something beyond control (protected classes woman dark skin). Great. Hopefully remove outdoor mask requirements soon.   much agree life almost back normal US. Covid far over. Especially global scale.

Too bad smoked weed last week. workers comp you. Incorrect logic! CFR presumably hospitalization rate drop past, they're close flat rising cases still lead rising deaths hospitalizations linear ratio. there's reason they'd continuing drop now.

The CFR really low now. months flat cases stabilized somewhere like 0.3-0.4%. Colorado also got low (although we're much younger UK) opened vaccinations under-50s. wouldn’t want work/hire someone refuses vaccinate. Selfish fucks, conspiracy theorists science deniers.

This right here, desire work interact people vaccinated 100% concern COVID, even main thing. also people refusing get COVID vaccine right now, hundreds millions doses given well six months, alleviate legitimate safety concern, sign whole lifestyle mindset want part of.

It’s strange feeling simultaneously happy going back work, worried super spreader events. There’s already cruise destinations require non-Covid vaccines really don’t understand you’re going about. 

Have ever traveled outside US? get it, unvaccinated areas, also natural immunity counts, too.

India almost one vaccinated, helps look UK like us vaccination see effects them. 

I'm one posted it, I'm watching situation cautiously. There's way get bad India UK we're vaccinated hit there. still wear mask work corporate wieners, bring mask slurpee runs, alone nice change. think probably right, misunderstanding ADE likely. someone grew christian eventually left, told early vaccines made evil pharmaceutical companies fulfill anti christ prophecy. kind teaching common Christian communities, honestly kind bs peddled fucking pastors, honestly even surprised ppl refuse get vaccinated. 

I blame Christians blame fucking pastors encouraging ignorance like this. already asked three doctors antibody test refused.

I’m saying requires specific look variant rely prior history precautions need take. increases substantially America may see restrictions coming back. people aren’t vaccinated. It’s easy think vaccinated safe, are, half people vaccinated. could end affecting even vaccinated. Would cool could learned something past 15 months made improvements regard, seems like case. Concerts higher capacity guests fill floor well seats Age distribution vaccinated people actually matter total percentage people vaccinated, people tend hang people age groups. Young adults group herd immunity, spreading work, school, parties. Detroit. Every Ohioan needs 6 shots SUPER IMMUNITY. 

I got 6th see walls shoot lasers eyes. “The paperwork” actually really important given vaccine specific storage requirements it’s important keep careful track lot numbers case there’s problem. able due rushing could undermine confidence vaccines put even danger ultimately. countries greatest need vaccines struggled distribute doses expiration date even advance notice this.

I wish they’d made public earlier little time find ways send elsewhere. word variant looks like kids 12? toddler. Wondering news coming India regarding kids. hospital said seeing many kids adult covid health issues saw earlier. came ok lot cases blood clotting organ issues.  prospective United flight crew applicant refuses get vaccine? Given post history, somehow doubt demographic I'm referring to.  Countries approve vaccine. also approve manufacturing sites.

So US site approved elsewhere, cant sent definitely would driven Dublin London land mass. rate infection much lower least half population immunity. doses likely tainted produced plant run morons, using them.   Delta variant already present US, there's much continue convince people get vaccinated, encourage unvaccinated people avoid high-risk situations.  anyway. Infections falling zero anytime soon, years. makes perfect sense! 

Thank you! congrats fully vaccinated! access expedited screening friends/family standby privileges trying argue flight delays happen normal people advantages you?

And arguments' sake, say wanted fly Boston visit Shenandoah National Park. could either drive 8-10 hours Boston, fly. flew, would leave home 2 hours departure account travel airport, parking/uber dropoff, bag check, TSA, etc. 1.5 hour flight DCA (assuming able get direct flight), probably 2 hours total gate gate. deplaning, baggage claim, rental car pickup looking another 45 minutes minimum, likely hour. 3-hour drive get mountains.

(That information given us 2 different official sources - work HR department, director school). document linked revised/clarified May 28th year current information.

Yes employers technically require vaccine, thorough reading, still recognized exemptions based pregnancy, existing medical conditions, “religious reasons” vaccine refusal. See section K.12 specifically. Religious exemption opens door subjective interpretation based “reasonable accommodation”. example, kid’s school teachers refuse vaccinate, can’t perform job online. It’s person, one one guided interaction special needs children, therapy close proximity one another. accommodations followed scope work, wearing mask. also lists parameters community spread, perceived “risk” others performing job duties taken consideration regarding ability mandate someone vaccinate allowed back work. laws aren’t absolutely clear, provide enough outs contested. Duck autocorrect dude / person! That's always say. still discriminated against, way restaurant requires wear suit/jacket discriminates potential patrons adhere dress code. Attire vaccination status simply protected classes, discriminated will. IL lifted mask mandate well - 264 cases yesterday. We're vaccinating folks weather getting warmer. We'll ok. I'm sure kids need vaccinated adults are. We'll know much September, thankfully. states low vaccinations already masking okay, states like mine 70% adults vaccinated likely breathe sigh relief.

I'm still masking kids indoors public. Waiting data see that's necessary Fall. Yes, also said lower supply AstraZeneca Janssen used

Technically AstraZeneca approved 65+ year olds, age group pretty much finished vaccinations new shipments AZ accepted (they instead returned EU pool).

Janssen paused indefinitely start, single dose vaccine used Sweden. really they’re cowards yellow duty patients, community country Minimal risk catching Covid China, minimal risk bad outcome kids conditional catching Covid. think Chinese parents rushing vaccinate. Calling policy shitty uncivil? Sounds shitty. I've already answered red herring. Go ahead look below. natural things include polio, diphtheria, smallpox. Measles. 

Can one person's body deal them? Possibly. Covid? Probably. population cannot. 600,000 dead last year+. Millions worldwide.

Yes, discrimination way drug test discriminatory towards drug addicts “In U.K., Delta variant rapidly emerging dominant variant ... replacing B.1.1.7,” Fauci said. “We cannot let happen United also said Delta variant contagious may associated higher risk hospitalization original “wild type” Covid-19 strain.

This Indian variant. 

We see lot talk future risks unvaccinated based history far. Two things keep mind:

1. strain may contagious raises risk hospitalization.

I think need keep cautious now, least kids vaccinated fall really boost herd immunity. even realize typed 😂😂 probably auto correct! want remove fertile breeding grounds virus move pandemic constantly uneasy establish another outbreak. wealthy world becomes vaccinated vaccines require solid cold chain kind useless rural developing world, really see issue pretending ""immune"".

Service jobs get rough. can't anything without continuously scrutinized.

I got left building hour. one even knew went. care, I'm talking someone another department bathroom.  chances getting disease vastly lower, chances transmission vastly lower, chances hospitalized drop near zero. That’s true. also true virus contagious, deaths simply going happen, matter what. I’m sorry happened though, honestly.    adults, population. Delegating job duties reasonable accommodation. 

Since EEOC guidance check 28 cfr 1630.2(o)(i) 42 USC 12111(9)(B) anti vax people probably big traveling outside safe spaces anyway.

Current studies estimate prior COVID infection cuts risk reinfection 84%.

Current studies J&amp;J vaccine estimates 66% effective preventing COVID infection.

I mean, comfortable nurse J&amp;J vaccine running around hospital, comfortable nurse prior COVID infection running around hospital. Bakersfield West Tulsa. many Okies without lick education common sense meaning what's point hiring people vaccine. Surely already vaccine difference make another person not. protected dose vaccine ? impression medical scientists wrong many, many things. remember 1990's everyone told eat low fat diet order lose weight, cholesterol prevent heart disease? people become monstrously obese impact heart disease saying, 'maybe wrong that'. manner chemicals environment approved government bodies FDA learning cause manner health problems, cancer, endocrine disruption.

Indeed, lot kind herd immunity (~70%+) 65%, spread like barstool like UK (similar-ish vaccination level). suggesting there's risk complacency including whole population percentages.

Yea dumb. Humans fly around world metal tubes people still deny vaccine technologies. HIPPA prevents giving information without consent. consent perfectly fine, showing document doctor gave you.

But probably ask vaccination cards, cant faked either since falsifying government documents federal crime. So… accent… it.. FOO… FIGHTERS? give gloves  Joe Biden opposed masks, vaccine quarantine? Handing is. propose do? People die, tragedies happen, unfortunately, mass tragedies like happen. can’t shut world it, move forward lives, seems good time virus retreat US. group fully vaccinated people, risk transmission almost 0. somehow vaccinated person get virus, probably even realize it, case likely asymptomatic. Problems arise unvaccinated people gathering. long majority people venue vaccinated, everyone fine without masks think. Well, may like this, believe low risk areas like new York many counties average less one case per day- probably fine unmask kids school.

In counties like mine still 4% positivity rate 60 cases per 100,000 people, likely hold while.

They live rural town, miles homes tiny population, much chance small town ever getting vaccine town.

Is available closer town know nice. freedom stops mine begins. getting vaccinated endangering people around you. reason able drive car sidewalk violating freedom  That's accurate based know (which admittingly everything since novel virus). example, see this: However, becoming increasingly apparent large number children symptomatic asymptomatic covid-19 experiencing long-term effects, many months initial Long-term Symptoms long covid first thought include fatigue, muscle joint pain, headache, insomnia, respiratory problems heart palpitations. Now, support groups researchers say may 100 symptoms, including gastrointestinal problems, nausea, dizziness, seizures, hallucinations testicular long covid research based adults. less information under-18s, part takes longer get ethical approval study children, says Natalie Lambert Indiana University School Medicine. 

Certainly less *deadly* kids adults, that's everything. I'll rest way easier kid get vaccinated. strip clubs well. Get ""Ass-trazeneca"" here. read something Texas governor attempting something similar well, could also effect? It’s still lab link. didn’t say intentional.

Edit add- need continue. didn’t notice article removed responded. get people feel taking vaccines right thing. point  people take it, can't expect people used experimented move past  community used said safe. people( black oth6er) want get fine. hear issues black people. response coming back way. People trying force us shame getting vaccine, still much about. Pharmaceutical companies lied much drug wonder anyone trust them, business mine. many people care take vaccines? many pressing matters us, zero interest those. much interest us getting vaccine? thing countries let land everyone vaccinated. Amazing DeSantis anti business. communism.  would entail negotiations countries different sets laws; pretty tall order two weeks (and that’s even including distribution). Exactly. super strange. benefit falsifying data pandemic? Earlier year, Turkey ordered Sinovac. government began smear campaign BioNTech vaccine since people skeptical Chinese vaccine’s data. makers BioNTech vaccine Turkish Germans people wondered they’re getting effective vaccine. lot discussions mRNA new experimental, Sinovac better etc.

Now China stopped shipments Sinovac, Turkey huge deal BioNTech, it’s vaccine available lot skeptical… Turks like British, anti-vax all, smear campaign earlier year caused problem non-existent before, thanks competent government.

I would also like include beloved president vaccinated December BioNTech, even available Turkey. also told everyone live TV last week got third shot (6 months post second dose) antibody levels great, case anyone concerned! might think mean non-vaxxed people, someone came back Albania (one countries require masks all, covid measures place, requires tests, vaccinactions anything else) PACKED people already, holiday season even start yet, and, least hotel, spots sold within 2 weeks till end holiday season (up mid-september)

I mean, we'll see goes, right now, within saw, people actually buying tickets, turn makes company reverse policies like Royal Caribbean did. vaccine passports people fucking liars. I'd strongly prefer federally verified vaccine data anti-vaxxers properly isolated society. JJ one jab done. also stable vaccines, need cooler temps. could literally go neighbor neighbor poor counties vaccinate everyone. Cities India densely populated could achieve day Keep maybe still Mexican vacation year. realize large portions world still cranking infections, mutations deaths?

That would imply Covid over.  I’m sure roof that. Agree. Moma one almost 600,00 died covid. 

She die it, virus taken seriously, trump anti maskers too. That’s word immune means. Immune means can’t get antibodies. ...good....want cookie? U.K. advantage ninety-lots percent double dosed high risk groups, deaths low.

The disadvantage youngest haven’t yet one jag, sociable, spread faster U.K. USA. check OP's profile, likely see many posts comments based past popular contributions authentic Redditors, OP invested communities regurgitate content long takes build enough karma make money selling account.

Maybe check account make blatantly false accusations.   leak wouldn’t intentional. google supreme court find PDF, mean google realiable source credible information.

Thank providing though I'm going read more. know baker forced bake cake like said was. words answered it, explained situations, want say yes no, twist question whatever need be.  sound like really understand works Everyone opinion. Science poll opinions. expect WSJ?  clarify, anecdotal evidence ***can also be*** empirical verifiable, even case studies. matters whether they’re done within scope scientific method. 

Just saying “it’s anecdotal” doesn’t mean it’s without scientific merit. Seriously, reach people would rather believe harmful blatant propaganda goes self-interest ?

There's lot cluster B personality traits floating around society. Also, people belong demographics historically neglected abused American healthcare system. words, cannot answer question would show giant hypocrite.  


Got it, thanks.  wasn’t lab leak. I'm fully vaccinated got nothing easily forged receipt. question. enforcing rules going forward? IIRC, there's nuance statement kids. Teens spread well adults. Kids under, say, 10, ones low spread. trying rewrite history?

Do normally try carry water inept government killed 6 700,000 Americans? law written earlier... Okay. point generally reassure person benefit still going outweigh risk get vaccine. don’t.   Think though: takes time reach countries approved JJ, find country ability take delivery immediately distribute it, bring additional vaccinators, book appointments/set pop-ups.

Then round up/pack doses safe shipping (even ones already distributed Ohio clinics). takes time. find/charter flight... probably days actually fly needs go, get customs... even literally people line airport tarmac doses (probably super-feasible lol) would narrow window.

I agree emotionally actually almost impossible ~2 weeks No, didn’t restrict anything bare necessities, location US lockdown limited true bare necessities, keep using words aren’t true. pattern recognition skills like makes feel lot confident nursing classes. many small, rural towns, local grocery store tiny mom &amp; pop establishment. in-store pharmacy (or coffee shop, bank, etc.) also Uber taxis public transportation kind.  able drive, depend friends family. (I raised area.)

That's nice program state driving vaccines people.  J&amp;J vaccine would valuable: one done, need come back. know NYC homebound population. It’s mix people won’t get vaccinated mad society leaving behind MuH lIbErtIeS nutters concept societal good. Right on, 🤙🤙 - spread virus
- quarantine one kid school kindergarten virus.
- remember right 70% must vaccinated achieve herd immunity Copy pasted again:

I drive. leave wallet home, lose phone, battery phone dies, misplace license, nothing changes daily life. take whatever reasonable amount time need replace it. still catch movie, go game, even grocery store interim. assume since tiny company made attenuated virus got Phase 1 trials within ten months, large pharma companies could even better accelerate process.

Yes, see mRNA vaccine simpler hence likely easier produce large scale rapidly.

But mind live attenuated vaccine would effective less uncertainty respect unknown effects body. went yet end week, most. palpitations opposite - instead extra beats, heart literally stops, skips beat, hits back twice hard next beat makes cough. Quite uncomfortable.

Be careful definitions. heart anomalies specific definitions. AFAIK, qualify skipping beat must long pause (I think 2+ seconds) heart rhythm. 

In case, extra beat called extra comes addition normal beats comes outside normal mechanism controls heart rhythm.

[Here's 3rd beat comes irregular time slot also triggered anomalously evidenced fucked waveform. suppresses 3rd normal beat happened regular time slot creates anomalously long pause 4th beat happens normally. 

I feel anomalous beats two ways: (1) much stronger normal beats, like heart spasm, sometimes creating strong physical waves stomach (2) sometimes feel blood pressure variations head anomalous beat, giving short transient diziness.

At worst I've hours long episodes one beat normal, one abnormal, one normal, etc. called Bigeminy feels really really bad. things went control, episodes started rarer abnormal beats, like one 4 beats, one 6-10 on.

I've also occasional situations 2 abnormal beats happened one another rare feel even worse. Three abnormal row happened even rarer. AFAIK, multiple abnormal heart beats one another serious problem requires immediate monitoring ER or, even stops, visit cardiologist. Good know. husband like ""hoity-toity"" NCL, like 15 years ago people like think colored opinion bit lol. I'm excited try something new! See, issue ""Almost every other"". most, every. almost 50% places taking necessary measures. Almost. 

Do see ""almost half businesses following safety guidelines"" ding praise? grew 25% rural 75% suburb area Ohio, probably 4th populous behind actual cities, people acted COVID exist entire time. Noone wearing masks store. Noone caring social distancing preventing spread. Every single person unmasked proud representatives every figurehead praise state calling hoax. 

I get speak whole state, speak trends(as lived multiple parts state pandemic) trend ""More rural = Less caring others"", 100%. like Flu Fighters know get ill catch it. also know small chance could positive spread extended contact. grandson already one surgery may need another. I'll err extreme side caution since work theme park teach. Oh skip party get vaccinated pandemic. 

How absurdly horrible.  going okay? don't, many feel way do. deny would naive. saying research found vaccination reduces risk infection death disease?

Did even bother reading comment replying to? Yes comment strongly implies reason people vaccinated refuse Yeah said “refuses to”. That’s different “is unable to”.  Yes course good news, obvious. disputing this. challenging newsworthiness based upon obvious I.e. employer this. Vacation Canada experience tyranny first hand!! implication anyone vaccinated refused don’t give us proof also don’t hire you? Ah, concession. accept defeat. work senior living kills staff refuse get vaccine. mass vaccinations Jan, get it.

But can't get everyone get flu shots either, I'm surprised.     want risk reduction crosses line personal sensitivity. SCIENCE!

Wait til hear laws speeding. yeah, you’d think many people screaming *“OPEN BACK UP! THINK BUSINESSES!!”* there’d support this. 

we’re thinking businesses! good news thats why. medical condition, would perfectly legal require doctor’s note stating can’t get vaccinated. No, incorrect. HIPAA explicitly talks healthcare entities (i.e. doctor) divulging health information.

An employer anyone else ask healthcare information person themselves. person obviously free decline, case employer saying would consequences. that’s totally ok. person choose hand info, business choose hire them.

What allowed employer directly ask doctor person’s info. That’s HIPAA about.

If don’t like it, lobby representatives change law. What’s stopping saying “I medical condition preventing getting vaccinated?” got called MS doctor UTI gave medication. never told them. ""private health information"" private buddy. Disabilities protected. vaccinated disability. getting ridiculous.

First airlines, even virus discriminating unvaccinated?

Smh. school year lasted day Labor Day day Memorial Day weekend. Yep, already seems like would clusterf*ck would add confusion lot people. Imagine businesses requiring booster others require fully vaccinated others don’t require vaccinations all. would also add confusion vaccine passports actually became thing. Would still good got original? need get booster travel? got original doses spring opposed winter? need start fall wait longer?

It honestly feels like money grab me. lot people got shots first time may willing less year. would essentially Covid shot clinics year round every year. Impractical. vaccination status isn’t “condition.”  customer business required wear mask June 15. everyone vaccinated employees won’t wear one either. less restrictive current regulations going backwards. hopefully precautions left keep us go backwards places like UK have.

Reasons I've heard getting vaccinated ""I already COVID need to"", ""I'm young really risk feel like it"", ""I want get vaccinated able decide put body"", ""I batshit crazy raving lunatic asshole."" People take far far far this. offense died balance covid pandemic nothing compared shit people endured human history. said... it’s frustrating deal something shouldn’t really require attention anymore time.

Also, please get rid hotel quarantine we're it. would literally listening expert panel weeks Idk, challenge.  Even protected class (which like said, it’s not), exemptions protected class measurably improves job performance. get away hiring male strippers. immune disease pandemic broadly good thing employer. might see number articles quoting Fauci saying opposite, also need pay attention get goals president established — namely **if get 70% people vaccinated** fourth July

Currently we're 63.7% adults one dose, might close, probably hit 70% 4th. Plus, number states *significantly* worse country's **you may see blips** **if handle well** unlikely see **the kind surge** saw late fall early winter

We're going reach crazy numbers again, things could still get worse currently are. handling well, track record bit spotty...especially states lower vaccination rates. There's lot overlap anti-vaxxers anti-maskers. ""Attest""... they'll lie. Cool. need written authorization patient explicitly consenting sharing PHI. needs documented health provider can't accused later following HIPAA regulations. that, private property would need permission first place. something said, recorded, happen, lol. good news, last seen antibodies stick around 8-10 months, also cases they've gone 3-4, safe right without ruining life(missing work not.) within realm reality, can't control people. I'd definitely inquire couple months see doc's know news breastfeeding vaccine, guys feel safe enough get it. reduces risk, prevent it. catch delta variant fly delta? :O  Cool, know antibodies? Ppl covid already like us got tested antibodies tests confirm that

And ""doctors"" quotation marks? established places MDs NPs staff generally push vaccinations stuff

I terrible reaction vaccine. basically ate away covering nerves (Transverse Myalitis). doctors originally thought MS. Thankfully wasn't. I've still got road ahead though. 

I'm TERRIFIED get booster fall/winter. honestly know bring (maybe different version would also effective I'd willing? Idk) .

How feel someone like honestly shots will, probably, never get third/fourth etc... can't think find ""selfish"" scared it'll happen get worse.

I expect current emergency unemployment benefits disappear pandemic singing swan song, we'll see minimum wage jobs even lowest minimum wage states fill back up. People got kids. Airlines currently surplus labor. See [this context. possibly work georgia? gold I'd give award. Thanks. necessarily want get job flight attendant applies jobs well. 
Although would love travel physical limitations long flights navigating large airports, allergies - may prevent getting vaccine - severe enough almost went anaphylaxis someone 6 rows away opened popcorn.  Probably banking outing since make central part identity. Australia here, still trouble retaining full time workers nobody wants work $23/hour (which perfectly livable area) sit home day nothing get subsidized taxes.... 


It's actually sort ridiculous, work culture isnt toxic, conditions decent, still took like 18 hires get someone wasnt idiot stuck around 2 weeks. 


My short term requirements literally ""show fuck work"" still took forever. probably as!holes stuck hands aunts chest gave staph infection sterilize properly first. remember kid revering doctors nurses knowledge skill...until actually use services found quickly fallible inept many are. Ah come though, saying there’s border entry points, it’s harder close them? don’t buy either. US government could secured border entry points similar attitude virus bio security Australia China matter. border entry points doesn’t necessarily make impossible control entry strictly enforce quarantining. could fully close wanted many countries did. choice. confirm freight side United slow down.

Say guaranteed 24-hour knockout year shot VS chance multi-day work flu (with chance infecting others), honestly going question do? hear, read differently would simply catering market base believes events past year ridiculous, number possible reasons, willing specifically patronize businesses willing behave way previously considered normal. draw line, though?

There’s someone could get value kids’ computers work, school games. 

Likewise allowance. Sorry kids, get allowance feed entire family another country. 

And second kidney could save life. 17 year old organs great shape high demand. talking called tight labor market indeed happening seem Covid caused ​an increase seems unlikely vaccine would.

Idk tell you- I'm quoting trying figure anti-vaxxer talking point seen

If seen one talking points either. Although seems think I'm antivaxxer- maybe missed comment say otherwise date, keep kids date get flu shot made mistake checking post history stop saw hours arguing homosexual relationships

Therefore? Yes, think they're wrong stance actually thought out- hard concept many transgendered relative

Ah yes, disagreement=insult SJWs can't stand worst obsession jerking Harry Potter Fan fiction. 

Leaving aside jerking-off thing ask. clearly find views homosexuality transgenderism abhorrent fact like HP fanfics *worse* that? Why? moral system operating? makes hobby (or guess particular hobby) heinous crime?  Nurses specifically positions aren’t medical staff? Meanwhile covidiots sharing bullshit articles airlines allowing unvaccinated passengers. help much. true work industry hiring pilots Definitely restarted since end covid. exact far away. Gotta use proper ü won’t 'Unvaxinated' protected class. …and?

Source: totally sounded like SNL Weekend Update punchline good one that! totally imagine Colin Jost saying it. Genuinely curious issue here. Potential inefficacy vaccine? like first amendment.

Uh, yeah. police *are* covered first amendment. That's legal prevent filming them, example. also showing police middle finger ruled protected 1st amendment speech.

And school? somehow get pass free speech (sometimes) -- think -- still *plenty* first amendment cases involving schools ... mostly grounds freedom religion.

Your employer? Probably not. *Unless* work government. gets complicated. Spirit vaccination center: 
 
1st shot: $35  
2nd shot: $135  FYI different people experience react shots differently. go random Reddit anecdotes, consult medical professional. True. U.S. contact tracing. love Spirit Frontier. know exactly I'm paying for: flight. three hours like $50. little cramped? Yes, without doubt. lot less cramped 2000 mile car ride. Also, gave chance actually go vacation! Regular airlines often expensive, airline make flying accessible masses.

Did get excited first time flew United saw TV seat? Yes. fly budget airlines again? Absolutely think forced compliance new thing? Let introduce entirety human history across times, places people. wrong people almost always power.

This society getting fed overgrown children deserve.  peer reviewed studies suggested people Guillan Barr syndrome could susceptible side effects? Second all, studies looked vaccinations smaller subsets disease categories really taking shot dark. see doctor would want cautious, especially already infected.  certainly choice. choice.

Conservatives made clear private sector impose rules conduct business, signs say ""no shirt shoes service"" bakeries refusing make cakes certain people everything between. different. understand trying say here, many things well-intentioned policies inevitably get turned around traditionally oppressed groups, understand pessimism. 

But solution accept vaccine hesitancy among abused medical system. continue work gain trust offer peer led education communities left behind due medical establishment reaching reestablish trust. 

Everyone deserves trust vaccine. Everyone deserves get it. throw hands air right answer. Fuck gunna buy ual now.. work big hospital good sources says booster needed. Let's leave that.  still Texas grow em stupid there.   I've never NCL before, Carnival (and Commodore, 30 years ago existed). booked NCL day said vaccines would mandatory  *At lower dose black, live black community. care someone outside community telling us do. would documentary anymore sway choices history ?  seems people getting sick dying vaccination USA already highest vulnerability groups, like old nursing home residents. guessing true UK. numbers bad, really. 🤘🏽 would opinion didn’t watch tv read news articles?

The never bothered first place.

You made wrong assumption, buddy.  J&amp;J vaccine isn’t effective. got covid month half vaccinated. Still haven’t got back sense taste smell 100%. lose completely. Oh baby ""cough cough"" thats rockin.... maybe misunderstanding Antibody Dependent Enhancement, body misidentifies pathogen similar different pathogen, sends wrong antibody, makes infection worse reacting brand new pathogen. That's always concern developing new vaccines, we're long past point would caught problem vaccines. said recently? recent reading said expect like measles outbreaks local communities low vax rates mind places higher vax rates. told that?...Steve? type food fighting? 

Jk yeah idk decided keep rockin till house torn down. Maybe Radiohead like psychedelic, Beatles, equivalent. different drug test lol  There's two issues here, re: cruises specifically, outbreak cause multi week quarantine makes total sense mandate vaccinations. Plus, exactly essential service. Nobody worse can't take one they're unvaccinated.

As general, long build proper medical exemptions, vaccination status disclosure, think infringement others rights choosing play russian roulette get it. That's sadly always lot.   Well viral tests work vaccinated vaccinated asymptomatic likely viral load makes worth going spread covid-19 level makes anything low risk.  They've stopped counting cases they're cases worth counting.  I'm bird watcher, I've stopped counting dodo's.  It’s 117 employees 26,000. saying vaccinated 25.5k+ stupid? tiny .4% anti vaccine employees stupid? state employees tough spot in. likely can’t force get like private company can. mean “force” saying lose job don’t get vaccinated. Nurses area lost jobs couple years ago getting flu shots. Years ago uncle’s doctor talked annual flu shots I’m still grateful; family tried ages success uncle believer convinced friends too. wish people good access care doctors necessary training time one-on-one work governor moved state report data week. think logic claiming knowing daily numbers longer necessary pandemic ""o-v-e-r"" something similar. Well one managed provide me... Feel free link I'll read through.

No I've studies showing this, said, issue studies show us anything. know mRNA us long term, point. start messing genes, may cause problems. Note every proposed mRNA treatment prior covid vaccine rejected due complications worth risk. ""There goes hero. Watch goes.""  would thought *having* vaccines would enough?  I'm person super scared variants, fully vaccinated worry much. vaccine protecting you. anyone vaccinated US now, choice.

However, kids 12 over, we're racing against. lot fully vaccinated people still give teens get it. want able normal school year next year getting enough teens vaccinated barrier that.

Our vaccines effective together.  Okay, doctor, give us precedence long term vaccine side effects onset 2 months.

Because ridiculous discuss risk something almost never occurs. we're it, something egregiously wrong vaccines, come heard it? sample size literal millions fully vaccinated least 3 months now. can't really blame black American government done propose badge ""Proudly Unvaccinated""

What find hilarious would gladly wear it... playing devil's advocate, Cal-OSHA board responding pressure members. Labor unions want blue collar workers protected factory/distribution jobs sites biggest outbreaks. board feeling pressure minority advocacy groups want time get communities vaccinated. Black &amp; brown working-class folk trail vaccination compared Anglos Asians. ""personal responsibility"" cultural historic racial factors come play talking Western medicine.  Anecdotally confirm. husband rural surgeon convinced several hesitant people brought appointments. Almost always post operative visits though, trust established believing title alone. music isn’t cup tea I’ve seen 3x. put awesome show. I'd happily go there. Nice weather barely restrictions speak of. pain neck living somewhere abide sorts rules even like fully vaccinated.  lots unvaccinated kids 16 going

The list Pandemic ""firsts"" going long. game, show. space configured differently concerts vs games anyway. guy like forcefield keeping spending money prior favorite vaca state.

But vaccinate younger people ratio go back nearly original values. mostly dropped age distribution infected people got much younger.

Whether ever sustainable ignore positive exponential growth really uncertain. Even population vaccinated still like 3% population catch COVID hospitals overwhelmed. 30% population unvaccinated let 10% antivaxxers catch it. positive exponential curve cut usually ends people sick time. Fair enough point whole notion needing disclose private medical information anything enough leave bad taste mouth liberal. think best way encourage uptake either, essentially punishing vaccinated well making disclose information may want participate society. course that's separate issue cruise lines. Mexico’s population 130 million, anyone wondering. someone vaccinated, better get COVID now.  amount immunity however comes gets us closer need be. I've fully vaccinated month now.

Maybe message mods. anyone worrying yesterday's increase reported cases US, almost definitely last week's comparison national holiday sharply low number tests/cases. Give days statistical anomaly go away. Pfizer chose really short testing interval speed testing process, that's got approved as, data shows longer interval might give better results. **This make next pandemic/public health crisis nightmare.** Pay attention states offering items getting vaccinated retroactively offering reward. People going come expect **reward** hold vaccinations... Good going Washington, California, New York... Yea cruise ship one highest number infections world one early point early pandemic. People live far close together days weeks time, combine really shitty vaccination rate US 100% going result people getting sick needing hospital treatment, would necessitate emergency end cruise. fast disease kill might even result people dying getting necessary treatment. 

It's completely anti common sense let operate without vaccine requirement.

Plenty jobs require medical exams, especially ones involve physical labor. many freaking people idea HIPAA pain ass photojournalist.

I've medical workers, once, say can't take identifying photos patients even explicit permission patient. reason think HIPAA protections extend beyond wishes patient, entirely untrue.

It's happened twice doctor's office - taking photos patient getting vaccine, permission, doctor explicitly said take identifying photos patient due ""HIPAA"", even though patient's permission. 

It's happened previous year various vaccine clinics. medical workers pretty aware limitations HIPAA, stubborn people budge matter much tried explain catch people leaving building. mean direct logical link comment? Yeah, total mystery. r/thatshowthingswork  media consume. parents think vaccine dangerous, deaths problems reported, benefits anyone old smaller risks. come ideas though, television Facebook told them. since friends everyone associate also buy it, must true. There's way could wrong. Anyone tries convince take ""brainwashed."" 

I'm afraid parents gone. i’m disabled even know that’s true, depending job yes may get medical exam and/or identify disabilities, chill

i got hired current job, big deal, it’s safety everyone, don’t put unsafe role regard disability. think that?

Pffffff . Jesus like doctors PhDs 100% know talking ats funny one wwhatever Waste covid test every 24 hours catch covid purpose get certification? guess UA flights FL then? fines every flight? comparing disability someone choosing vaccinate themselves. ridiculous comparison one personal condition affects disabled person immunizing prevent spread communicable disease thus affecting everyone person comes close contact with.
