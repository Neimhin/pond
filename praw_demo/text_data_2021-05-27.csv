Once vaccines rollout complete everything back normal. Eh, someone accusing TheCrazyDude21 lying 3 people group 3 people 30 dying COVID statistically unlikely. 

I felt conflation meaning ""unlikely"" ""impossible"" line. careless use statistics make opinion sound legit also irked me, although think TheCrazyDude21 better job dressing overly simplified math particular was.

Shift US things teetering free thinking may getting toe hold - always rely something horrible perpetrated psycho-loner get things back track. Almost like clockwork. Nothing stochastic that.

You infer whatever like above, statement occurrences. people fucking psychotic look covid deaths US, females 40-49 represent 1.05%. back January would ~10 per day UK based that. demographic much better vax covid running rampant. Let alone groups.

Basically.

The EDTA introduced need mechanism activated platelets get circulation form clot. EDTA chelates calcium pretty well know cahderins cell glue proteins whose interaction calcium dependent. EDTA sequestration thus could increase capillary cell interaction allow complex escape.

In blood collection using EDTA prevent clotting higher concentration blood sample removed body. Coagulation depends calcium effective. case cannot work since concentration low clot distal (far away) injection point clotting still effectively occur.  think there's common sense area here. mild cold quite different flu. aunt elderly, frail living nursing home others, visiting flu like really bad idea.

Likewise, ""practice learned"" simple things like wash hands, cough elbow, etc... literally job. interesting see many people continue get booster shots. economy fine, better pre-covid nevertook much hit compared developed countries due fast effective measures, year measures uncertain time lines. Australia also highest median wealth planet (jumped 2nd first 2020 well) we've got much larger breathing room everyone too, three times median wealth United states too!

I honestly never understood argument northern hemisphere economy better constant ongoing covid restrictions short hard elimination strategy. hold weight Australian public government responded with/forced elimination.

The effect people family abroad pretty bad though, I'm sure describe unique pain seperated family end date. People leave, coming back becomes complicated. really hope things normal July 4th. party resume pre pandemic life. I'm tired hollow hope   may really stupid believe one hundred thousand chance vaccine side effect worse one ten chance long term chronic disease symptoms covid, utterly selfish extra stupid sacrifice lives one three thousand people die 3000 people* get covid get cherished ""lifelong antiboidies"" seek, somehow believe superior antibodies vaccine gives person.

You planning catching polio order ""get immunity"" well?

(*) Let REALLY clear this. 2,999 people murdering one old person, stupid compare one ten vs one hundred thousand. wife bought also vaccinated early year. I‚Äôd like freebie too. It‚Äôs end world, right thing, right away, may deserve free walleye. issue lot places like alberta well - particular strong anti-mask contingent, people refusing vaccinate people flouting rules? 

Alberta seems worse situation (at peak coule weeks ago multiple days 2000 cases day - way worse per capita manitoba now), managed turn things around time - province crawling antimaskers covid deniers.

BC bad spike lasted couple weeks things gone way probably open populated provinces. also anti-mask rallies every week multiple cities. think attributed turning weather causing people follow rules hang outside more, also targeted vaccinations hotspots. firework posts worst. You‚Äôre convalescent relatively low risk, there‚Äôs that. You‚Äôre taking precautions avoid infection spreading excellent.

However, think you‚Äôre going encounter get vaccinated 200 million people haven‚Äôt already encountered? Maybe also said ‚Äòsorry‚Äô coronavirus It‚Äôs retroactive. already qualify entered. Well, California surplus. think people right thing first need added giveaways. Plus, $25 gift cards? Fishing license? isn‚Äôt going get people strong (mostly un warranted) opinions vaccine get it. Needs bigger include MNs. Certainly tragedy family. worth noting back January UK covid deaths per day. seems vax without risk, importantly effective much greater risk. live Japan lmao quick correction, Victoria 34 active cases current outbreak Melbourne 30 cases. We're 5th largest, darnit! Good thing holding It‚Äôs wild, don‚Äôt want give away I‚Äôm - vaccines plummeted redneck shithole state. Everywhere else seems going great.

We won‚Äôt ever hit 50% live.  No... still eligible big prizes, $50 opened they're [not (they're 35% fully vaccinated now, apparently that's enough). [Germany, Austria France recently banned travel Yah Why? states already it. So, I'm reading correctly, saying perfectly okay 1000+ families Ohio kids end hospital spending days worrying whether they're going live spend minutes unencumbered mask....

So compassionate. Much empathy. Wow.    friend got first shot today, know changed mind may helped Remember January February opened fast.
Then got 3rd wave? 


Guess still alot people ICU 3rd wave. 
Let's make last wave take little slow let vaccines rates increase.

Once ICUs drop 400 people probably see things start open faster slow steady We've sequenced every infection since mid last year Australian. leaks hotel quarentine. Hotel quarentine perfect, situation let good enemy perfect.

Interestingly enough, VIC actually upgraded hotel quarentine facilities negative pressure.

And think society isn‚Äôt bad shape, I‚Äôd really interested interpretation what‚Äôs happening US last year! Another ""high"" day deaths worry, 7-day death average still dropping US.

Yeah bribe reward. carrot stick statistically speaking reward got announcements. indictment society. see you‚Äôre saying sure. person didn‚Äôt need convincing won. don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs really goal overall - want show someone win, win get shot up, kinda basic lottery theory.

A weeks later came COVID described ""worse thought would be"", like ""smoked entire pack cigarettes"".

God, glad basically immune COVID now. Nah Oh well doesnt work get free. That's socialism. experience 7 day worldwide average reached incredible think almost doubled May. 2/3rds China lol hey, whatever gets world sooner normalcy better. 

Also Japan doubled doses 2 weeks, gotta triple mid-june want Olympics go smoothly. India's gotta pickup pace, know they're suffering see apply 1/10th China's applying kinda sad. clearly real galaxy brain  hear wanting wait. still stubbornly holding approval even though likely get hate it. 

I‚Äôve COVID, recovered, still work home, wear mask, I‚Äôm pregnant. 

I doubt there‚Äôs anything wrong / dangerous vaccine would *really* like full FDA stamp approval... Yeah, getting vaccine, least chunk them, seems imply COVID something **need** vaccinated against, goes squarely the, ""it's big deal"" narrative ego (and behavior) tied past year And? really makes difference I'm saying. Hundreds people dying many could saved vaccine. Upvoting important, I'm glad see kids dying. Bloomberg says 1.78 billion doses given point worldwide. 291 million US alone.

So we've already vaccinated 10% Earth. idea there's sort nebulous side effect hiding 900 million vaccinated insanity. I've trying figure good idea could work. explained well! That's 7 day average, NYT Times reported 964 COVID deaths 26th.

I'm slightly short 964 death figure, NY Times reported 966 deaths 26th, rolling 7 day average Needs post imo Jokes edgy funny, kid, unfortunately neither. Unafraid let buns hang out, judging photo. censorship anything goes want people believe. Thanks I'm psychologist, bartender lot time hands Yep. Went got mine next week. I‚Äôm going let antivax idiots get sick. Yeah, among first groups vaccinated people article pretty credible media outlets Australia blocked sudden interest around investigating origin makes wonder something uncovered recently that‚Äôs prompting us dig deeper. 

To clear, even come lab don‚Äôt think nefarious reason. probably due incompetence/lack appropriate security protocols. $5 million go far giving population large. divided evenly among employed people Ohio would get 95 cents. Oh think that, thx agree. heard Israel pretty much dropped restrictions ago US process dropping them. (the UK reopened week ago mentioned seem going well them) worry 80-100 year olds risking health working healthcare opinion? Excellent explanation psychology behind it!

Believe me, *extremely* active early height pandemic good feel mods doing. anything leaned right time. Might still.

Everytime see new thread new Biden investigation calls pop up, first couple comments see are, yes, complaints past. 

So anyway, I‚Äôve realized turn need unsubscribe one runs whatever course be. It‚Äôs nice seeing good news lower cases come in, actually don‚Äôt like arguing Reddit. :) enough 2020. Ohio giving away $5 million would cost ~$750 million give everyone gets vaccinated $100. Russian propaganda, effective is, notorious sloppy easy sniff out. transmission rate jail, one wonders. Newsom, Democrat facing likely recall election year, said money California‚Äôs program well-spent convinces reluctant residents get vaccinated.

This utterly irrelevant. He‚Äôs losing recall election, isn‚Äôt shore lack votes. Might well say Newsom, man started kickboxing local gym, said money well-spent... idea care about, engaged discussion. ranted think position moral superiority, pretty gross.   Hopefully guy hang couple months survive proven wrong. Maybe, maybe, it'll change mind conspiracy bullshit. 

Then, change minds others, forth.

One hopes. Totally unacceptable, so. us responsible smart enough get shots early miss completely.
 That‚Äôs peachy. Nobody could seen coming! üò£ rare, work healthcare lot coworkers contracted covid become symptomatic vaccinated. 

None hospitalized.

Locals wanted vaccines already got theirs. good bad? Cries Singapore HIPAA applies healthcare providers related entities insurers. concert venue still haven‚Äôt opened vaccination adults.* I‚Äôm vaccinated work primary school lot younger people (under 60)it‚Äôs still available. 

I think correct anymore. I'm early 40's, living Bayern, managed get Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccination Wednesday week, simply finding random medical clinic vacancy making booking online. 

While talking doctor age bought related risk blood clots (I'm considered low risk age due male), nothing qualify ahead anyone else.

The NSW equivalent NZ level two restrictions outbreak. Limits gatherings indoors settings masks public transport indoors public spaces. 

NSW needed level three type lockdown since initial lockdown.

Let's forget 1100 mroe calendar year half state vaccinated Sorry, need first buddy. seems excessive Fantastic! Australia's COVID-19 infection rate skyrocketing Hawaii plunging. Hawaii 23.5x people fully vaccinated Australia. mean I've Australia, total population like 20 million, anyway looks like this. üòÇ  That‚Äôs true. There‚Äôs phased rollout different people eligible based age risk factors. 

The majority people know eligible registered interest received first vaccine. Australia administered approx 115K vaccines today. 

Australia started vaccination program late February weren‚Äôt aiming emergency approval/use vaccines. we‚Äôre behind lot countries sense urgency get population vaccinated. ""Its race. rush"" - Scomo Vaccines reason I‚Äôm sleeping couch tonight. Covid endemic anywhere - was, would see roughly steady baseline. haven‚Äôt. childhood vaccination highest world. might thinking fact debunked autism caused vaccination study Australian. doesn‚Äôt actually translate whole population antivax. Vaccines hard get hold whole world views low triage list, cannot locally manufacture mRNA vaccines.

We bet lot local vaccine, due local manufacturing, unfortunate side effect making people test positive HIV (although without giving disease). Canned one, slow boating here.

Either way, vaccines alone let us hold business normal unless above, say, Canada's position today - we'd never be, given relative different experiences urgencies. stomping still required interim.  ask lot questions beliefs without judgement, curiosity.

Unless nightclub owner though, lockdown. Exactly. level lockdowns unsustainable.   Barely. assume talking Victoria ?

 - First lockdown - 16 Mar - 12 Apr (27 days)
 - Second lockdown - 30 June - 26 October (118 days, aka 17 weeks) Edit:BBC says [112 quite 200 days, point many countries much much longer lockdowns AU has.

Because general rule, economies fully open - nightclubs closing 6am kind deal - masks rarity.

Take current outbreak - cases attending two major football stadiums, looks like bender weekend (all night, half dozen venues), etc.

So vaccines herd immunity stage, ie equivalent fully open economies (ie: parts US, now, really), either need throttle back massively sustain reach stage... need lockdown extinguish.

We're currently opting latter, stage seems less disruptive throttling entire sectors economy months end, waiting vaccines.  People west eat like cake, like WMDs. lost cause, decade manufacturing consent, people ready fight spooky scary China. poor choice go AZ consider making mRNA vaccines here. clear calls made. yes, government accountable poor choices. true?

The guidelines follow Victoria actually quite strict we‚Äôve terrible experience hotel quarantine outbreaks. We‚Äôve learnt lesson. problem federal government guidelines recognise attribute risk airborne transmission virus close spaces like hotel corridors Victoria. result, states follow national guidelines therefore get outbreaks hotels.

To make things absolutely clear poor traveller set outbreak coming back home state, absolutely nothing wrong hotel quarantine. open door room Wrong time pick meal got infected person room across him. confident system gonna work entire year decided step vaccination process...I hope contain outbreaks cause vaccination rate tragic *cries Brazil* fuck's Tassie? place going utter ghost town summer. love see it.

They get re-elected :/ Fair point. case, assuming people get second dose 6 weeks first, look number 6 weeks ago instead (16 April 2021). closest data date Apr 15 (0.93%), Apr 18 (0.96%).

Okay, I'll accept that, number *fully* vaccinated people Japan right probably 1%.

Though would note graph kicks steeply upwards April 18th, rate vaccination certainly increasing. Lousy. announced phased rollout, first phase frontline workers &amp; senior citizens. *some point* enough vaccinated, next phase would begin. Problem is, senior citizens Facebook getting bullshit info, they're getting vaccinated. we're ridiculous situation Federal &amp; State Governments upset enough people getting vaccinated country safe, country allowed vaccinated &amp; there's timetable happen.

What would prefer? endemic. Plenty people get getting tested become part daily lives. 

The US problem poor healthcare system. Scotland really issue. lockdowns pretty much unnecessary. Yes. got flew Adelaide quarantined medi hotel there. went Melbourne spread little. missed person got found yet, managed spread quite bit realised, Melbourne 7 day lockdown 14,000+ primary secondary contacts iso. fr? that's really impressive. check believe, looks like 10% fully vaccinated n 25-30% one dose. bolsanaro, that's mighty impressive 


Says lot australia n india even bolsanaro significantly better Yeah really harsh. can‚Äôt say lockdown anywhere near bad believe places world much stricter.  Many reasons.

* Australia's vaccine work out. looks like might effective Covid, also side effect making HIV tests false positive.
* Took long time spin local AZ production, blood clots caused Pfizer recommended people 50. imported low supply days ago.
* Even people eligible AZ complacent reluctant, sitting around saying there's Covid bother. decision stop recommending AZ 50s meant eligible people started make fuss want wait around it. sigh.
* government's done shit job promoting vaccine. Boring ad campaigns, politicians jibber-jabbering it, creative messaging.
* Logistics slow confusing. meant go GZs, GPs doses. Took months set big centres, apparently real planning urgency. People became eligible yesterday reported call phone line dozens times.
* Moderna apparently accept legal liability government budge negotiations long time. Novavax coming, um, maybe sometime?? Nearly 1 500 people US dead.

I prefer approach.  indians think same. bodies thrown outside hospitals, drowned rivers &amp; buried open sand - due shortage crematoriums &amp; last rites resources 


Tell anyone annnoys ""why get vaccine"" nonsense It'll pick pace think. first AZ couple weeks ago count vaccinated second shot 10 weeks now. There'll bump early group (50+) they'll push stats up.

This happens person traveler infected/positive, emit viral load air. build quite bit enclosed room. traveler used aircon anything like that, air high density viral load easily infect someone breathed in.

Anyway... traveler B tested negative released quarantine hotel. flew Melbourne, Victoria shortly later on, developed symptoms.

I agree generalization.

I agree ""benefits outweigh risks"". long vaccine causes 1 death less COVID OK ask everyone take it?!

Example. person 40 years old. work entirely home. keep distance. chance getting COVID virtually 0. ""forced"" take AZ alternative? It‚Äôs spreading community Taiwan. I‚Äôm starting think it‚Äôs escaped control. joke. Can't believe say this. informative, thanks. 


Looks like supply shortages + poor logistics + hesitancy fair, be? wife‚Äôs work like 40/250 people get shot.. one December. made mandatory week. wife‚Äôs best friend traveling RN hesitant work made mandatory. work offered extra vacation day changed peoples minds edge. that‚Äôs way like it. Look that... chemist chemical needs! I've read somewhere Biontech exclusive marketing rights Germany Turkey.

But that's confusing Germany buy vaccines (other Sputnik) directly manufacturer, got everything EU ‚Äì believe EU bought doses Pfizer, Biontech?

So maybe answer ""only Turkey deals directly Biontech"", looked that.

China would deal Fosun (and claim Taiwan needs buy Fosun, too).

And rest world needs buy Pfizer. That's understanding superficial TBH. First world elitism. rather Australia thanks.  guess right sense. never scared dying covid, never really crossed mind. younger age group, it‚Äôs solidarity wear mask. yes true, confused it. country imposed themselves. thanks correction! adult staff? Kids acting‚Äôs transmission vectors? run can‚Äôt hide.  That's....a good question ü§£ I'm actually sure! someone says they're going chemist 99% time means they're going buy medication guess scientific chemist would need clarified haha Exactly! People take know it‚Äôll get back normal. can‚Äôt shown data sheet cases dropping, need incentives!! woman‚Äôs pubic region put autoimmune disorder can‚Äôt get flu shots tetanus shots I‚Äôm sure COVID would worse doubt low, honestly. Everywhere else Europe reported around 1 75,000-100,000 it? reason think UK would different. 

Still acceptable risk personally (hence waited couple weeks Pfizer, much digress GP) still unlikely cause harm. still offer everyone choice though, 40's, like USA. Must nice country takes deadly disease seriously. central Canada worst outbreak yet pure laziness citizens. I‚Äôm fully vaccinated recently indoors mask crowded places. feel fine. Vaccines work people!!! Hopefully things turn around guys. 
On vaccine Olympics front. Shutting down! Oh, spending time every year since kids eligible getting flu vaccine shots, teaching wash hands, teaching control coughs, teaching cold flu season touch head unless they've washed hands, teaching wash hands soon get home, recommending came conversation every parent social circle, everything except wearing mask due social stigma time wanting get bullied it, waste?

Cool... Don‚Äôt make grimace hamburglar call pharmacies ""chemists"" Nothing ever perfect, would very, unlikely. Bold assume people actually read manual.  call real chemist then? (the scientist type person chemistry) Morrison good job. really re-elect him.... chemist Australia place go buy medications such. might know pharmacy perhaps? plumber come house day fix clog washer drain. got talking asked got vaccine, said ""No never plan taking it. gives serious side effects."" 

I'm fully vaccinated, uncomfortable guy house. put it. I'm Alabama 1/3 people vaccinated. cross fingers hope catch variant kill me. plan moving safer place eventually.  Exactly, thank you. exactly deal this. 

An example world. Melbourne well done. qualify, first 2 million people begin complete vaccine regimen shots starting Thursday automatically entered win. 

So rewards people hesitated take vaccine? responsibility take credit. Heck, even failed counted chickens hatched. UK 7k new cases business like normal.

Thanks Boris! One picture side street? Damn, nice thorough work pal... elected fuck Giving away cash prizes vaccinated weird fuck, right? 

Anything free shit guess. encourage students teachers stay home sick, idea. practice sticks around good. One dose one mRNA vaccines context- State Fair really high quality event here, getting free tickets isn‚Äôt trivial reward whole world basically hit alt-f4. Oz vaccine? Yeah mental gymnastics people throughout whole thing tiring.

The idiotic ‚Äúgatcha‚Äù questions/statements erode faith humanity day. Pfft. Rookie numbers. Gotta get up. understand release total tests done? Positivity rate important number track. ""discount chemist"" ironic? contact tracers tired

It's break sense contact tracers tired break needed extra time without contacts making contacts catch up. number exposure sites massive there's something like 10,000 plus close secondary contacts. contact tracers trying catch people. 
Wow guys bad /s mean country literally hair salon posted SM saying vaccine welcome salon.

This happens US, too. daycare Miami said allow vaccinated employees. Luckily idiots like loud minority. Nearly everyone I've spoken real world either wants vaccinated already gotten it. reminds movie Incredibles Screenslaver. properly merge screenslaver fox news? Floridian, Florida isn‚Äôt great model compare anything know 39 counted cases means probably 500 + cases counting. Donate, ffs, waste need great somewhere else? world scared enough COVID go buy groceries? Rural area midwest here, dragging feet. infuriating. That‚Äôs insulting potatoes. dare  find helpful point Australia = USA - Alaska. pretty much bang-on. helps people realise yeah, Australia bigger looks. definitely summer (tops 45c / 113f) winter (lows 0c / 32f) though. rest country north gets much stable, it‚Äôs fucking hot time üòÇ times it‚Äôs hot wet item sways found, found. Original thinking Covid-19 (SARS-CoV-2) likely jump humans animal species. COVID-19 contageous managed spread across entire world manner months. even affected iwell isolated populations.

Yet year almost half, world found animal species (reservoir) came from. finding zoological source point makes causes much likely. Heres something similar. Likeihood death age. absolutely nowhere even close 20% 40-49 age range  gonna much success beaches, gonna awful weather tristate area Yeah, northern hemisphere seasons really translate southern coast AU.

There cold front's cycling around Antarctica year round. Every couple weeks one fronts hit south coast, bringing rain and/or drastic drop temperature. northern hemisphere weather system anything like that. cake. MRNA vaccine production complex specific. USA would provide IP, monitor production, retest local vaccine local population given massive changes local production conditions (humidity, temperature, weather, available resources, availability skilled labour, potential contaminants etc.).

Oh wait, are. Worldwide. right thing do. Pat best! Yeah interesting. states granted? guy eating restaurant family members live household height pandemic. Trust none charlatans. people keep getting 60%number from?

For mrna vaccines, period 2 16 weeks vaccination, 92-96% effective depending study. Again, people fundamentally misunderstand definition freedom misinformation legitimized sphere dEbAtE generations. 

The second one‚Äôs fReEdOm infringes upon another‚Äôs safety well-being, it‚Äôs longer free anyone. 

Grow educate yourself. Inoculations never optional. sounds roughly consistent heard too. got AZ Berlin, Germany, last week (I'm female 40 something). doctor administering vaccine described potential symptoms clearly emphasised importance speed ‚Äì like ""If get these, hesitate, call us, go straight emergency room"". Well mean yea. Vaccinating people basically death bad could lead dying common side effects fever, headaches etc. side effects would cause great strain frail bodies well, Federal government sitting 1-2 million AZ doses... could make available people want them, want that.

The rollout slow several thousand doses expired / gone bad... 

They also told doctors many doses get (sometimes little 50 week, 5 vials), yet told people call select clinics book in. clinics meant deal that?

The Federal government also responsible aged care, able get that, small, risk group vaccinated, despite us producing AZ onshore since late Feb...

The vaccine rollout abysmal... incompetent joke. Badly. one worse financial aid place previously ended. flight India takes less 6 hours.... funniest part almost always lead concern trolling line ‚ÄúNot antivax, *insert wild anti-vaccine misinformation here.*‚Äù

I daily arguing people invaded sub. tough work brought certain satisfaction. wish fact would get attention. really think would get many fence. may optimistic, think another year lockdowns. anything incentivize people take shots.

Pfizer supply increasing, AZ recommended Australians 50 risk clots higher risk disease Australian context. there's hesitancy AZ population. seem plenty AZ.

Our federal government handling vaccination program fantastic job.

People complacent receiving vaccines people Covid basically non issue. Melbourne terrible year, individuals struggling elsewhere, pretty much everyone else country experienced little impact pandemic.

Our vaccine (UQ) caused false positive HIV abandoned 2020.

We started vaccination program later rest world get emergency approval use TGA.

Hopefully situation Melbourne wake call. federal government diverting extra vaccines now.

But candidates looking hired much easier. hire anyone who's vaccinated. Im sorry hurting. great youtube site: Crappy Childhood Fairy. helped years therapy. claims talk therapy good people C-PTSD re-traumatizing every time keep talking it. Anyway, really good.

Having said that, YES, still get vaccine. studies people covid *plus* vaccine looking like gives robust immunity even 2 doses without previous infection give you. buy many people getting reinfected symptoms covid. get vaccinated? 
If not, not? opened they're well

In comparison who, previous weeks UK? rise cases unexpected given indian variant easing restrictions. According [this UK less cases per million countries, quite distance.

The restrictions France/Austria/Germany limit spread Indian variant within countries. Fomite transmission flu known huge vector years now. Surface cleaning hand washing absolutely best defenses flu. one loves lockdowns. either risk getting uncontrolled outbreak like India variant came from. watch way much TLC, it‚Äôll rot brain lesser focus cases (as opposed hospitalizations deaths)

Why? countries high vaccination rates cases dropping faster deaths, similar level hospitalizations. Welp, time get covid I'm convinced 99% people say they're uncomfortable EUA waiting full approval intention ever getting vaccinated. want come anti-vaxxer least little bit self-aware.

They thing children's vaccines. supposedly pro-vaccine concerned schedule think many. First, think we're place virus spike much anymore aside areas.

Second, weather going god awful weekend think people gathering much usual. Totally agree schools. Read whole thing though. kept masks mandates vaccinated longer needed sounds like still indoor capacity restrictions. guys holding onto control much possible federal government forgot buy vaccines, AZ vaccine shown issues blood clots, blamed population ""vaccine hesitancy"" ones pushing issue.

The federal government Australia says they're ""on standby"" help Victoria, that's they're fucking good at, ""on standby"". New Years Bushfires last year, Ruby Princess vaccine rollout, stand thumbs arseholes fucking nothing. someone wants send us Pfizer get rate pretty quickly. 

Worth noting countries head start rollout due emergency use. emergency time.

So yes, FedGov blame many ways. don‚Äôt enough vaccines there? That‚Äôs great! point, folks see still wearing around assume either vaccine hesitant otherwise unable get shot. hope continues change minds!  That‚Äôs average winter temperature high population density areas mean quite deadly. 3.5 million people died it, people would lived family friends virus didn‚Äôt exist. bad, hospitals overwhelmed. 18 months, vaccine here, hospitals adapted, people still wear masks aware. So, what‚Äôs up? closing everything many cases? incompetent time? still extremely afraid? amount people thread questioning praising getting little worried. Yeah Australia, trying change culture ""going work going sick"". We're pandemic bit cautious strange times. Testing sites Australia pretty much everywhere testing also completely free. Results usually take 24 hours come back (around 12 hours Victoria).

Traveler B released quarantine hotel felt sick days later. traveling around supermarkets, work even trains symptoms. decided get tested 4 days later.

One recent case (which kinda resulted traveler B), male 60s. symptomatic 12 days time, went work bars/restaurants. main cause concern lot colleagues infected bars attended pretty much packed full Saturday night. 

This probably main reason lockdown know many could've potentially infected bars attended. Also 50% patrons attended restaurants/bars check-in via QR check-in system. QR check-in system basically help contact tracing event outbreak... like now. matter, lives matter. number people dead determined many population exposed virus long takes get everybody vaccinated.

In ideal situation, country would reduce cases near zero vaccinate almost everybody, total number deaths single digits per millions. ability produce mRNA vaccine here. CSL could however Oxford Vax. 

We going build mRNA production facilities, takes time. Taiwan also nearby. Meanwhile Manitoba, Canada malls open 300-600+ new cases daily . worry can't go walk park friend even socially distant  Teachers 50 Aust get anyone else. We're essential convenient. 

On hand, get free flu vaccine every year nurses even come school deliver it. that's nice. actually know happens public schools though. think either state council organized covid-19 vaccinations federal. fubar-ed soooooo bad.

Also pregnant currently, also fully vaccinated issues. registered Vsafe include vaccination statistics pregnant women. That's china Australian good relation while. China produces pharmaceutical inputs intentional leak virus much serious accusation. advised! Panic buying Aussie toilet paper , around corner. stay clear windows! average Melbourne winter little misleading. get low 2-5 degrees, also interspersed warm periods low 20s. don‚Äôt get vaccines control, approach speak worthless. system locking one hardest world's also effective.

Damn straight is. Last year living SE South Australia, far border Victoria. niece born late March Melbourne never able go meet due border closures lockdowns, way September left country. Still met her.

Hurry get vaccinated everyone, life return normal. high vaccine rate? massively delayed using doses, affected rollout much. lots ‚Äúcommon sense‚Äù theories pandemic. Like theories microchips vaccines injecting bleach system cleaning. Common sense relative term. Phase 4 still trial. Honestly, lot places many extra AZ doses available, people going (in sufficient numbers) get vaccinated. No, really. Since last Friday know probably get seen discount chemist? chemistry supply would cool. No, pretty different. happened couple month ago reported then. people freaked out. Norway made pretty clear thought vaccine related. result investigation. 

The difference population predictability. old fragile people. Norway blanket vaccination policy care homes considering vaccine appropriate case-by-case basis. 

Evaluating case-by-case prevent deaths, since unlike AZ issues, pretty predictable. Brisbane used similar ""circuit-breaker"" lockdown bit month ago got back zero less week.

I deal several short, hard lockdowns year remaining time feels pretty much ""normal"". Untenable forever, course, least vast majority vaccinated. Australia partying like crazy weeks back? answer hear Australians (I‚Äôm also Aussie) it‚Äôs much putting fingers ears going LALALA context yes, right. always people whose immunity work properly robust. there's also large number people natural immunity may work perfectly reinfection *and* variants, data exist. Hence whole reason ask ""how sure that?"" Thanks, thats thought googled popped viri/i, I've googled pops that's misconception :p. Apparently Viri plural man. I've everywhere country. agree table lands plains cold, I've found snowy mountains ranges gippsland areas particularly cold country. Cooma, Parkes etc quite cold, fiercely consistantly find Victoria is.

And yes, Tasmania south colder still. winds coming across Bass Straight major impact. memorial day surge happening. Like super bowl surge happen anytime /s BS hearsay allegory. ""Likely"" determinative factor applying without facts back up, supposition. threat vaccine causing ignorant see reason get vaccine. removed misinformation ""Supposes"" cause, pointing finger Pfizer without facts back up. Similar publishing medical paper without peer reviewed, means nothing lead misinformation.  Yes wasn‚Äôt lockdown. Okay. Looks like people Australia following rules better looks like US almost one hundred times many cases per capita twelve times number deaths per capita. probably best context make point. Wrong. See comment directly yours. We‚Äôve already addressed this, you‚Äôre 500,000 square km US. always NY drivers me. can't move over?? Yes, you‚Äôre right. Melbourne‚Äôs experience quite different parts country/ Donating would great, sadly transporting vaccines free since HongKong probably sees (enough) incentives spend money it, dumping easier cheaper. happily ignoring changing evidence science realized making unpopular. feel like Bruce Banner - ""Wait, there's Janssen Johnson &amp; Johnson?"". single dose vaccines? word chemist pharmacy interchangeable Australia. trust vaccine? Odd... Dude would piss beyond measure. whole year severely locked down, vaccines available rolling remarkably slowly‚Ä¶ ugh think saying makes sense. 
The reproduction rate depends way people behave. Jolly social life = high reproduction rate. choose lock - beginning, when? hospitals full? real difference. keep reproduction rate, lockdown inevitable. Seems lockdown beginning may look unnecessary, prevents lockdown later, mention hospital beds lives. Contiguous US land area: 7.664 million km2

Australia land area: 7.692 million km2 live ‚òπÔ∏è I'm concerned. People eager get out, gonna intense OP natural immunity. comment brought immunization. Maybe misunderstood quote meant, though.

My main point anyway ""how sure you"" know yet much protect. Half antibodies someone else may still 100% effective. I'm sure viral load many things throws wrenches that, too.  Yeah CDA reenacted mask mandate spread schools, particularly high school. think saying can't require marks despite outbreak. I'm side border, super irritating. would domestic terror attacks actual attempt revolution would quickly destroyed people outside change numbers all... Inside maybe. Let's see. looked 50 healthy, eligible. boomers getting vaccines, let us get least.   Well issue think vaccination campaign went public health ""freedom"". faster get vaccinated faster get freedom back, might persuade doubters certainly also created hyper competitiveness among willing. Especially know end line.  Pay walled. entering every NY resident vaccinated rewarding people didn‚Äôt right thing begin with? Australian's overally generally ok way government run things making decisions like pandemic.

Also Melbourne went massive lockdown last year go 800-900 cases/day zero, think least acceptance pursue covid-0 getting back normal way life shortly.

If opened low vaccine rates things would go hell pretty quickly lot people would get infected would die, approach take one justified. know couple people early 20s who've it, probably depends vaccination centre? Dunno (shrug)

But yeah, approve risk. went AZ wanted give business CSL. get booster firmware upgrade? thinking day. Australia New Zealand lot better vaccinations countries they've cases wild. going take lot get heard immunity say US, Italy UK. Could switch Canadian strategy prioritising first doses speed things up? get firmware upgrade required one month receiving first vaccine installation? Melbourne one first places stage 5 lockdown last year lasted 4 months? Definitely 3. leave house 8, travel 5km home, leave house except get grocieres 30 minute workout. Fines $7,500 fine individuals caught actually enforced unlike countries I've read about. I‚Äôm sorry, sucks. think cases schools undeniable didn‚Äôt want shut schools completely again. many phases quarantining whole classes grades time half staff due quarantine. became eligible end March. high school teachers came later kept high school kids online learning longer primary (which grade 1-4 Germany, young kids). multiple cases per week.

Hope get shots soon! It‚Äôs everyone‚Äôs best interests. Oct/Nov would earliest would plan Pfizer get approval 12. said plan submit approval Sept(assuming trial complete then) expect approval process heavily scrutinized. 12-15 EUA Pfizer took 1 month submission expect 12 longer approval time. People used free PCR testing provided government denied boarding people used private industry PCR testing paid pockets allowed board. 

Follow money...  least they‚Äôve done pretty well keep country. actual lockdowns almost nobody leaves house, government afford support everyone affected financially. need worldometers dashboard tracking number comments daily threads time. probably best covid metric available. fact even aged care fully vaccinated way got hit first wave mind boggling me. Amazing. awesome harness natural abilities. Umm, no, amendment states vaccine passports legal. 

You can't cherry-pick amendment fit stupidity remarks. 

You stupid, good, right?  can‚Äôt let unvaccinated people in? Lol least idiots pay $20 free piece paper comes protection virus Citation Needed. 

From United States Centers Disease Control Prevention: ""The known potential benefits COVID-19 vaccination outweigh known potential risks, including possible risk myocarditis pericarditis. continue recommend COVID-19 vaccination individuals 12 years age older.""  THANK thoughts exactly. happy tell people stay home second they're limited choice whining moaning freedumbs. Stay home assholes! Digital things, notoriously difficulty edit.... think HIPPA would allow thing. surface statement/question...also curious.

I'm assuming need willing provide legit vac docs. seem bizarre me. Every animal tends take path least resistance worry morons country 

This message everyone country, message people MA. Dumb Japan hold Olympics, IOC power here. know technically Japan could say repercussions would severe. study provides evidence immunity triggered SARS-CoV-2 infection extraordinarily long-lasting. Adding good news, ‚Äúthe implications vaccines durable effect‚Äù, says Menno van Zelm, immunologist Monash University Melbourne, Australia.

Read article I‚Äôm favor people getting vaccine bodily autonomy necessary part free society. Far damage done demanding people ‚Äúshow papers‚Äù. However, willing sacrifice liberty security, make medical records public could protect individuals. Let‚Äôs make public STD database well.  scared nightclubs pre-March 2020 different feeling way after. UK links medical records pops NHS app automatically. like comment mine ""being vaccinated still afraid"" question answered million times. Herd immunity important keep variants happening keep people immunocompromised safe. They'll say ""They stay home"" somehow better people even lacking functioning brain.

That far much collectivist thinking individualist American.  Get real really underestimate popular Teenage Bottle rocket is. Safer get vax disease! intubated several days previously immune system went haywire pneumonia (pre-covid), yeah, that‚Äôs experience wouldn‚Äôt wish someone absolutely hated. vaxxed huge relief. hope enjoy surprises are, fact, absolutely wrong. every right disclose health records. Third parties, however, not. 
 
 Also, *have* disclose anything, scenario. get discount do. Much like military discount, senior discount, student discount, coupon.... Last read around 78% internet stories? think creepiest thing virus long haul effects seems every age group. (Diabetes, lung damage, autoimmune issues, erectile dysfunctions, brain fog, depression anxiety, fatigue, heart problems). pandemic control health care system going whole new beast tackle: covid long haul. believe it. 

Also: variants. far *knock wood* mRNA vaccines stood amazingly variants, virus still circulating many poor countries won‚Äôt see vaccines while, could odd variant evades immune system. Downvote me, whatever, I‚Äôm saying virus done odd shit peoples bodies need top variants possibly boosters people fall need be. UK although issue cards, added online version linked NHS app linked medical records NHS number. Surprised USA gone online verified version. Harder fake. I‚Äôve already moved talking UFO disclosure time instead COVID. 

This sort world-altering craziness get behind.  LET‚ÄôS FUCKING GOOOOOOO! hopeful (perhaps naively) kids waiting get till finals, etc end case side effects would make miss school ... maybe parents finally get shots time. 

I‚Äôm optimistic we‚Äôll get full FDA approval (is reasonable? honestly haven‚Äôt followed it) military jobs start requiring we‚Äôll get good bump there. 

Just gotta keep trucking!

EDIT: oh yeah maybe college kids getting first shot college require fall, too.   Ah ok. % americans 18+ - 80%?  make concert worried infections Forced vaccination punk rock...just sayin dealing pandemic year really don‚Äôt care people abuse lenient sick policy, coming guy deals call outs find people cover them.

America general really use time general anyway. might vaccination rates lag. Absolutely everyone know Netherlands wants vaccine. would surprise NL end close 90% vaccine acceptance.  people supposed carry card show? Mine definitely get beat fuck concert state really can't something like state borders blocked bodies water similar.

So that's reason Cuomo even try, makes sense. Thanks sad deal fallout many people still paralysed fear due lies pushed media politicians last year brazen attempts force compliance policies. along many others spent last year getting scolded attempting tell people immunity likely robust long-lasting. among many lies pushed functional brain lol evident comment responded to. 

They somehow grasp there's pandemic new illness studied long term effects (because can't new) preliminary studies showing people kinds problems like brain fog heart issues.

They think.

It's like comment mine ""being vaccinated still afraid"" question answered million times. Herd immunity important keep variants happening keep people immunocompromised safe. They'll say ""They stay home"" somehow better people even lacking functioning brain. I'm worried side effects. saying I'm scared public. Pretty sure Israel's 62% total population, no? Biden goal simply 70% 18+. Let's hope vaccine helps, infection, hospitalization death. Keep eye see happens next couple weeks. True, Hawaii archipelago. Semantics aside, he's right. infinitely easier control outbreak isolated group islands. State lines lower 48 border checks. Cases != mortality

I believe article talks effective preventing death (not infection) No, Krispy Kreme giving free donuts people show card They're still letting come, exploiting them?

 *great message send*  Good concept, bad execution. Fake vax cards everywhere. mass death. I'd probably say something along lines ""the one come across tomorrow might one last year.""

It probably change mind spot, might plant seed. state actually digital version covid vaccination app digital driver's license. people get shot microchip probably trust digital license actual item tracking location... Oh well. You‚Äôre real trooper still getting vax condition scared without 'average'. Scalping usually high profit venture.  still seen half dozen people drinking fishbowl bars yet. that's back know pandemic over. eastern washington, one knows, might well completely different state side washington MUCH different 

 eastern washington killing vaccination case numbers. vaccination rates horrible Lmao started talking something like ~~repub~~ idiots whined somehow violates freedoms. thing things like free healthcare free education. Man like poster boy Dunning Kruger effect, quite amusing. give update. 

I‚Äôve full vaccinated nearly two months. Since I‚Äôve going gym maskless. Also, pretty much gone everywhere else maskless since CDC guidance changed two weeks ago. Despite that, contracted COVID-19 variants. 

The vaccine still working me. absolutely protection variants relying natural immunity protect you. vaccines offer amount protection variants. discussed previously sub, main problem skepticism rather bureaucracy That's good point yes, think that.

Yeah choose vaccinate f right off. live US. reason go Canada unless they‚Äôre forcing to. seems dumb make divert another country, put greater risk infection, flown back home states Free market works benefits republicans long happens good enough:D

For record major country gone 62% (Israel). Lets see Canada UK reach 70% actually looks like way scam government surplus COVID-19 funds. way say used raise vaccine amounts charge government $982 per ticket. pill made wife infertile would take (as husband)? Lmao one choice whether they're black Asian. guess could argue antivax folks choice whether born stupid one dangerous others (not getting standard vaccines) one not. (Not white)  Depends got it. local hospital got mine NJ sent digital vaccine card. 5050 split producing baby?

Whether misguided still zero full term baby birth data public another 2-3 months. Data trials look good far us many places basically anyone wants vaccine get one.  
""Experts Brazil, Europe United States agree number children‚Äôs deaths Covid-19 Brazil appeared particularly high."" 


Took 5 minutes google it, read 2 articles come back quote you. Maybe one spreading misinformation consensus numbers showing problem investigated. Cmon man. numbers high reason. yes everything wrote relevant discussion discuss covid-19 general. seen UK's numbers lately? They've surged, vaccination rates higher ours. bet barely noticeable. allowed drive I'm black drunk! Discrimination! /s

No seriously, good reference great point! wonder many people disagree ardently comparing risk dying vaccination risk dying infected SARS-CoV-2 ...but without considering need factor probability becoming infected first place. Multiplying estimated probability death infection estimated probability becoming infected produce *massive* difference risk estimate. See comment below: Here's how, say ""tickets $18 proof vaccination"". want disclose ""medical records"", proof. Vaccinated people comfortable showing proof also eligible discounted price, that's choice works. 10% profit nice greeting comrade. wanted let know, Taiwan country part China. Enjoy day

-Big Brother I‚Äôd rather risk federal charges reap ‚Äúside effects‚Äù vaccine mainstream narrative within 2 years case numbers pop weeks, we'll find month. much surge, we're good go. I‚Äôm concerned people use types headlines justify skipping vaccination  simultaneously participating reopening feeling uncomfortable it. spent year wary even close stranger, mentality take time unravel. I'm going back everything used help speed process.   Schr√∂dinger‚Äôs data‚Ä¶ doesn‚Äôt exist it‚Äôs observed entity qualified universe  likely reverse: high rates infected people selected variants could reinfect previously infected. thing observed Africa also. it‚Äôs   email link edoc hosted hospital need enter birthdate, zip code, cell number view digital vaccination records. There‚Äôs also QR code link add Apple wallet. Apple wallet card says hospital name, name, dose, type lot number vaccine, there‚Äôs barcode scan. I‚Äôm Tucson. got vaccinated POD site, UofA. got lollipop, crackers, sticker! think knew systems would constant attack.

Get tons people‚Äôs medical information cause people get vaccine keep data stolen? *Russia in!*  make argument. understand saying. already told you, variants part this, antibodies memory cells there, work like that. Months ago, subreddit talking reinfection thing second time got covid usually worse. bright. Seriously. baffled thought refusing serve minorities accurate comparison. can‚Äôt believe free market try ban abortion.. it‚Äôs service definitely makes profit. France re-introducing tighter rules arrivals UK French residents curb spread Covid, notably Indian variant, foreign ministry said Thursday.

Wow would probably problem tourists going Heathrow multi country trip. 
I heard big issues Indian variant England, people getting infected. word impact vaccinated/unvaccinated? month lady drove vehicle tents vaccine site. law works hospital vaccine administration team received death threats.

For vast majority people, ya contrarian. real crazies taking action. argument say basically ""I senior scientist say says this""? Appeal authority fallacy much? way, really want go there, PhD chemistry work closely pharmaceutical industry academia research develop things, including many worked developing treatments pandemic.  


So tell incorrect saying? article literally summary research study provides initial evidence develop long-term immunity infection SARS-CoV-2. I‚Äôm inclined agree children vaccinated makes nervous. old family friends really, really want see again, couple small children complicates things.  even buy fake one. schedule vaccine, take info, give card, tell wait. leave.

i shocked that's happened got vaccine. could walked handed me.  I‚Äôm fully vaxxed think everyone else I‚Äôm remotely enthusiastic show anyone paperwork go back normal things. It‚Äôs pretty big invasion privacy potentially start slippery slope. someone selling alcohol wants know conditions could affected drinking? dance club wants know cardiac issues? kayak rental place wants results last physical? There's reference number used verify. would quite surprised private businesses could access relevant database, mean anybody suspects fake, authorities check likely need pretty good explanation card came from.

I‚Äôm going get mine July (AZ, pfizer sinovac). ask thought modern countries like EU would vaccinate faster us. even trying argue lmao Wow interesting. thought immunity doesn‚Äôt last forever?

Am wrong thinking way various flu strains circulate annually? someone got flu one year next year flu strain hypothetically circulated, person would still immune?

Most countries two major parties. know, like REAL democracies. pick multiple Left Right parties unlike USA.

I supporting opposing either side. pointing political POV works.  love stupid people proudly show stupidity? came vaccinations, least.

The whole New England region made lot mistakes early pandemic, true. asking divulge actually protected information vaccine provider like clinic asked questions. vaccine yes/no answer divulge anything else you. fair, experts really start giving real advice deaths already happened curious; people can't take vaccines various reasons (like allergies). believe charging people ethical, moral, free market operate? I'd bet hundred bucks 70% three weeks. There's big problem people getting dose one getting second dose. 

Take look number people getting vaccinated week compare numbers second dose.  see issue.  Sure, we‚Äôre subject, think major differences COVID obesity? know guy lost OPT went back home pandemic starting. Definitely messed lot people‚Äôs plans. may true look 40-49 group overall, there's lot variation individual covid risk (I'd wager lot deaths among women 40s come narrow section population). obese person multiple health problems extended indoor contact lots strangers much greater risk virus someone perfect health lives alone works home.

For someone former group, AZ vaccine much better choice unvaccinated. someone latter group, isn't. personally zero it.. lot people behind eveything it. He's proposing spending like government gonna making $1k/dose hah. We're fucked think highly us. Combine low percentage civilians carrying antibodies due contracting virus new contagious variants spreading globally, Australia trouble. I'm Western Australia told even vaccinated premiere open borders anyway, 0 incentive get it. jobs W.A since borders closed nationally internationally hand, seems like r better off, though housing market turned shit renters. hypothesis (see responses) happening, know anything sure yet non-problem. involves several dozen people jumping queue. total, 8,6 **million** vaccinations given. get wrong, jumping queue abhorrent selfish, two-digit number people jumping queue basically expected look amount people getting vaccinated. fact, even lower thought would be. 

My fear older people look news conclude young people reason we're 'only' vaccinating people born 1972-3, much case. real limiting factor supply vaccines, negligible amount people jumping queue. sense urgency PM cabinet bunch assholes. country world going 3rd party

Pfizer? lockdown, take photo ? change jobs move different state kind money. chose vaccinated‚Ä¶however, believe ppl right abstain inoculated. don‚Äôt judge honestly it‚Äôs place to. Also, everyone who‚Äôs fence vaccine ‚Äòanti vax‚Äô believe it‚Äôll sterilize them. Take care let others be, it‚Äôs responsibility get vaccine us. I‚Äôm vaccinated happy‚Ä¶I pray everyone stays safe healthy, regardless stance. are, relatively decent vaccine program government super careful regarding Astro Zeneca vaccine blood clot info came light. lockdown won‚Äôt anything except stop transmission bloats ridiculous amounts matter days like second wave did. coast. gets much colder inland Yeah, sorry you‚Äôre right. Vic different experience lot Australia. bit unfair comment. live Germany WA would speak family members going weddings living normal life. seemed bizarre happy them. know Vic NSW much harder time. WA whole ‚Äúisland within island‚Äù thing going on. desert one side, ocean whole lot nothing between, it‚Äôs different story. Well people Japan pretty vocal asking either delay another year, cancel games completely.

Tourism said completely out. However athletes, trainers, staff permitted intend televise entire thing without guests. Word still residents/locals.

However still 90,000 people around world coming place now, 5% population gotten single dose vaccine. warnings blood clots A.Z vaccine came light, government stopped people 50 getting vaccinated order focus higher risk folks. It‚Äôs lowered 40 now. 7 day lockdown it‚Äôs relatively mild lockdown, it‚Äôll stop chain transmission give time seek infections like last snap lockdown here. Yep, states went hard. feds shitcanned states nothing, took credit success states had. American UK. much transmission virus UK compared US right (and US sooo much better). Germany, France Austria, feel hack lot safer UK would countries. government brought JobKeeper program stood workers, got $1500 fortnight 9 months last year. 
The big annoyance lockdown it‚Äôs mainly due someone COVID symptoms week getting tested isolating, went business time spreading it. He‚Äôs also 50, eligible vaccinated quite while, may greatly reduced eliminated spread. Bloody dickhead. yall lacking vaccines? Thanks. I'm Queensland lockdowns pretty much same. Essential workers allowed go work unless could work home. Essential workers classed basically anyone still job lol. Also actual essential workers amazing. Tasmania exist get aus 3% whereas usa like 40% fully vaccinated although anti vaxxers issue think one bigger problems government shut website could see vaccination date delivery woes, Pfizer deliveries uncertain 153000 total 755000 doses next week next 4 weeks. Florida quite literally made legal run protesters ‚Äúif feel frightened‚Äù. Simultaneously, also define three people gathered together meeting criteria riot Tasmania colder. 12 older. 16 year old shots 14 year old able get first shot last week clarify, 5 million Victorians 112-day stage 4 lockdown last year. small lockdown, reduce numbers hundreds day 0. lockdowns various stages outside period. 

It's recent, small outbreaks we've introduced short ""circuit-breaker"" lockdowns. Well yeah liberals got Seuss.

So like... Murder okay? Yeah. They're dogshit humans. Exactly. parents got vaccine, none friends want to. could literally walk vaccine centre without appointment get jabbed. queues, etc. uptake super low.

That's probably going change outbreak... There's nothing like fear drive human behaviour...  guess get help get massive headache (or abdominal pain), impossible know situation worsening happens. give break numbers grow exponentially. go onto lockdown contract tracing gets point impossible. end like America.

The break give contract tracers time catch get people sites known. person contact yet goes 20 places that's 200+ people added list. point data fine, 


That's regulators including european medicines agency (EMA) recommended AZ age groups start. See here: EMA recommended granting conditional marketing authorisation COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) people 18 years age.

It (not all) individual health regulators european countries decided diverge european regulators opinion. Looking deaths per day europe I'm convinced correct move. Well, hopefully changes mind vaccine county lockup, transmission rate jails pretty bad. reactionaries \[...\] made several attempts enshrine practice law.

Could quote source this?  agree you. close successful vaccine rollout get can't forced another 2 months quite strict rules/lockdowns. NHS really crappy time. Yesterday 49 hospitalisations Bolton hospital alone. Boris mad man keep thing hoping different results. open week lol... lives essentially normal. Better months pandemic lockdown give contact tracers break?? fucking kidding me? wrong country/state? lock many million people homes deprive ability earn living plus billions economic damages because... contact tracers tired, seriously said? Aside shutting borders stopping citizens returning leaving without government permit line NZ north Korea. much !

They can't even manage god damn qurantine system hence there's outbreaks. big country. can't get right ? 

And get proper proper vaccination program despite wealthy country is. fucking joke 

Then brainwashed Australia think 1 case covid ok though 2019 800 plus Aussies died flu. 

They election win next year suppose. wanna keep jobs. blame putting rather country first. talking about? Lol  Unfortunately Murdoch controls lot countries media like usa  news raving deaths vaccine. scared people 50 actually get it. post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

It's also possible mutates lethal version.
If ever good reason override patent protection laws, it.

True, Melbourne different experience lot country. NSW also longer lockdowns I‚Äôm mistaken. Always harder higher population density. people dies it, mostly old people pre existing conditions. Australia/New Zealand started vaccinating yet huge issue, probably change leaders incompetent order vaccines.

In Finland one leading doctors said probably given rights easily. understand needs restrictions many sides problem. restrictions prevent hospitals overcrowded, prevent virus together. still worth remembering people corona like flu, even though media tells otherwise.  average australian hasnt, took hit Parents testing kids anymore keep blamed outbreak. Maybe hot take feel like headlines dangerous unproductive right now. understandable need investigate ""leaked China"" theory reporting way going exacerbate trend racism/xenophobia Asian Americans Pacific Islanders (AAPI) IMHO ""OoOo CoNsPiRaCy"" headlines going get people killed. reasonable person knows a) lab leak theory highly likely b) AAPI *literally control China.* everyone reasonable someone going see use justification commit hate crimes.

[See: low blood platelet levels, would strong evidence. easy blood test done. talking Japanese people? yes. Japanese government no. going force Olympics die trying. mild. Melbourne worst Australian outbreak 12 months ago (Jul-Aug). Melbourne's climate population density clearly makes suitable another outbreak. Meanwhile Netherlands back 3000 day opening again. I'm sorry ridiculous. Vaccinate God damn population. don‚Äôt know UK. slow lockdowns start with. live Hamburg. We‚Äôre coming 6 month lockdown. Spain, Italy France pretty tough time too. think it‚Äôs great Aus short sharp lockdowns numbers get hand. Here‚Äôs hoping vaccines soon though. think Aus handled everything quite well, seem quite far behind curve terms vaccinations; hope vax timelines shaped science complacence. US almost 2K deaths per million people number go (because math).

NZ 26 deaths total. reach US deaths per million another 10,000 people would die.

Aus around 900 deaths lets say around 50,000 deaths needed.

What would ear? sorry, way upto..... 2%? Yeah good smaller scale issues.

Its working anything fed level controls unfortunately. kind media/industry capture politics happening makes sense feds nothing e.g. get us vaccinated, set better quarantine facilities, improve fire services act climate change. mater much thise things actually effect people. States cant really things without fed $$ Based mom friends 50, fact none want get media made fear vaccine much, it‚Äôs slow. 

I‚Äôm sure offered $ would, right now...none want touch astra v ten foot pole 

Not even mom seeing grandchild almost 2 years incentive get it. 

I mean country literally hair salon posted SM saying vaccine welcome salon. majority comments supporting them. 

I believe it‚Äôs haven‚Äôt hit hard seen death like states. 

I hope get soon, want go back see family. I‚Äôve already missed grandpas funeral. It‚Äôs like mom come here, government won‚Äôt let leave... Yup. think US govt waited 18 months investigate this? already know. announcement pure posturing. AZ does, distribution rights china held Kantai Bio safe one dose? took AZ. 

My family scared go buy groceries I‚Äôm one fam jab. Yea wawa gotten shittier shittier. don‚Äôt get everyone creams crap hoagies get better one basically every single street deli pizza joint Thanks info. info NSW little hazy. think main issue cruise ships early recall correctly. problem, copypasta created r/italy tried translating see reaction. :) call Pfizer Italy. definitely changed.  Won‚Äôt enough Pfizer get younger people covered October-ish.

The original plan AZ younger folk, blot clot drama meant ordering significantly Pfizer planned.

Not really government‚Äôs fault though they‚Äôre getting lot blame. trials even completed we‚Äôd ordered enough vaccines vaccinate population 3 times over.  mostly AZ (blot clot issues), University Queensland one (cancelled side effect you‚Äôd test positive HIV months) Novavax (not yet).  We‚Äôd ordered (5?) million Pfizer. Oh plenty people blaming federal government, responsible managing vaccine supply. There's reckoning coming point.

They bad luck well though exacerbate incompetence. 5 vaccine options pipeline. locally developed vaccine effective key flaw made stop development. EU fucked us AZ. AZ, main fall back, clotting issues restricted 50+ little alternative supply younger people. supply issues vaccines worldwide. local AZ manufacturing minor delays added snowball. mess really. Endemic where? know word endemic means? small businesses lockdown? much emergency funds majority people have? country government cannot afford lockdown affects poor citizens depends daily wages. It‚Äôs weird. felt happy longing there. course things clear here. never wanted like us though. I‚Äôm really grateful Australia response it‚Äôs spreading control across country. I‚Äôm happy citizens residents see worth inconvenience stick rules. Good you! come south get it. available everyone including mainlanders. Government paid salary (~$750/week) first year.

My employer still paying 7 day lockdown, despite closed work. say sure little surge cases increased demand vaccine Victoria. don‚Äôt think slow vaccination program entirely due low demand, extent contributes think lockdown actually help bit.  personally hard choice, I've suffered health anxiety, point made life miserable one main fears clots, know lot people 30 bothered risk AZ would still take jabs offered right small small risk head risk terrifying. trying talk going back feel I'll letting community fully vaccinated, jab get mind asking? catch-22 situation Asian countries facing(Taiwan, Singapore, Thailand, Australia):

\-Aim zero covid keep life close normal 1-2 lockdowns past 15 months caused become vaccine hesitant (why take. vaccine anyway cases arent entering country). Given slow pace rollout region ironically somewhat perversely US/Canada/EU year ahead true ""normalcy"" (normalcy endemic state accepting cases deaths per year via mass vaccination).

Im interested see countries ever open 2023 2024. suspect maintaining bubble normalcy blocking borders may popular political sense. least far Australia /NZ concerned dont expect open borders 2023. suspect public popularity measures maybe hard resist ruling governments. Partly explained Astrazeneca dominating Australia's vaccination program 12 weeks doses nobody yet second dose (AZ vaccinations commenced March 8).

By total doses rather fully vaccinated picture nowhere near embarrassing rapidly improve second AZ doses begin administered. think context decision make virus actually unvaccinated community. 

Some government don‚Äôt balls lock entire city, ends thousands dead covid. Meanwhile, Hawaii week hardly tell there's global pandemic going on, people wearing masks. Beaches packed, stores restaurants busy. ... says someone posting Reddit There's lot mistakes too, including 17 hotel outbreaks, many could avoided obvious measures like masks, routine testing, keeping doors closed. Despite these, intention right states done well unofficially following elimination strategy.

Vax bad many reasons, suddenly looking brighter (a) latest outbreak lockdown national wake-up call citizens authorities alike (b) sudden availability millions Pfizer, recommended vax people 50. People would take shot shots take. vaccine using it‚Äôs 60% effective? don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever read one less 70% effective first shot. coalition wins next election start talking opening borders rush vaccines. Personally hope outbreak serves lesson, people get vaccinated faster, coalition gets voted slowarse vaccine rollout. Hey sorry. mostly call BioNTech think I‚Äôve mostly heard referred Pfizer English-speaking news decided refer here. yes, officially BioNtech/Pfizer. Seems like success federalism me! Checks balances working intended. China's incompetence responsible bringing virus world. hard trust part solution. Boy look like idiots Trump actually turns right something? That‚Äôs point. complaint wasn‚Äôt news speculative, AAPI hate crimes result negative sentiment towards China.

It news Biden directed multiple intelligence agencies investigate it. complete story start finish reason publish, potential hate crimes also reason publish. $50 retroactive? recall starting look pretty good. /s Seeing bag bench wondering homeless event lockdown? eternal September

Wow. heard looong while. might right btw  Australia producing vaccines... Yeah, really agree personal choice, I'm glad made one comfortable with. made different decision second shot (F/28), way invalidate choice made.

With pill comparison, really thinking (not even passionately) whether comparison might still hold. think lot people insert meta-text think comparison AZ pill might hold, must also believe people get AZ. think complex that. Imaging scared mask. I‚Äôd like interject moment. you‚Äôre refering Pfizer vaccine, fact, BioNTech-Pfizer vaccine, I‚Äôve recently taken calling it, BioNTech plus Pfizer vaccine. Pfizer develop vaccine itself, rather another company called BioNTech created original formula, went Pfizer's clinical trials became vaccine use days.

Many people got vaccine refer Pfizer vaccine, without realizing it. peculiar turn events, BioNTech-Pfizer vaccine widely used today often called ""Pfizer"", many users aware basically vaccine initially developed BioNTech.

There really Pfizer contribute vaccine, people partly thank corporation, part allowed vaccinated. Pfizer distributor responsible clinical trials. Clinical trials essential part vaccine, useless itself; done somebody developed vaccine first place. So, Pfizer vaccine used developed first place BioNTech: whole system basically BioNTech Pfizer contributions, BioNTech/Pfizer. so-called Pfizer vaccine really called BioNTech/Pfizer! Vaccinations necessary don‚Äôt need public health measures, see? Inland cities, like Canberra, significantly colder Melbourne. Although Melbourne coldest large city population millions. ok, originally thought. makes even simple. confused said lumped pfizer biontech. 

Anyway, everyone goes pfizer. period. thus, perversion fosun's exclusive right distribute taiwan. 

ffs, talk topic. 

the point vaccine kind separate exclusive distribution right? Moderna, AZ, Johnson &amp; Johnson, sputnik, sinovac... another vaccine signed exclusive distribution rights particular region? Almost 100,000 up, probably under-reported. Plus human cost suffering long term side effects. don‚Äôt think endemic Australia. definitely US. 39 cases here. short lockdown put place we‚Äôll back actual normality / cases week two. 

The fact incredible loss life experienced elsewhere accepted norm what‚Äôs really worrying. 2020 vibes.

What's end-game here? gonna 39+ cases everyone vaccinated too. something uncovered recently that‚Äôs prompting us dig deeper

Yeah - tech innovation. model spread covid Wuhan using supercomputers going shortly. They're lining ducks make clear CCP fuck up.

I'm 90% confident going originate lab. Sounds similar india - federal government responsible vaccine procurement n they're incompetent  tens thousands died states loved ones might disagree. Life pretty much back normal found new cluster Monday. 

Won't long back again. No, Africa needs *distribute* 20 jabs six weeks.

The world history dumping food, money, aid, medicine... Africa go waste, never get distributed, get stolen. Memorable moment anyone watched Australian Open. evict crowd evening match five day lockdown begin (they become effective midnight). yet everyone lived lives normally. go right back 40 people died Florida every one Australia. 90% Australian deaths one hard hit state.

Life also ""normal"" months (minus hundreds thousands covid deaths like US). 

Florida great model compare terms success controlling covid deaths. info I'm early 30s got first AZ jab back February, first mass group young people, nhs/carers category, havnt gone back 2nd due clotting issue, personal choice suppose, also use birth control ""pick"" one risk clots other.  haven‚Äôt first peak yet. vaccinating? what's reported right actual facts anything official. read article, speculation gossip. 90% article officials refusing comment matter confidential yet public.

""There's unexamined evidence."" shiz sherlock ongoing investigation. news sky blue behind clouds. raining live there's greater mystery color sky is. Wtf. could see case normal times is... unconscionable. 

Source? Yeah state govs lot emergency powers, e.g. countries Europe. feds mostly demanded open state borders, schools reopen etc states basically ignored year saved asses pandemic. weird dynamic. dumb ignorant ? 30 people give 2 people lockdown (as you‚Äôd it), that‚Äôs 60 new cases. 60 give 2 people that‚Äôs 120. on. Also 30 people confirmed cases undoubtedly large number people asymptomatic/undiagnosed unknowingly spreading well. lockdowns happen. risk groups largely vaccinated already

We even vaccinated half 70+ year olds yet we've vaccinated hardly disability care residents all. One public health measure one unnecessary government overreach That's people received at-least one dose, 60% effective first dose classify 6% vaccinated. haven‚Äôt solved problem infectious ass spreading Brazil 25% fact Australia still need horrible lockdown brave life-saving, incompetence government. Vaccine, vaccine vaccine. She‚Äôs beaut Clark! point sinus brain clots(actual name escapes me) vaccine rare everyday life. Clotting legs, kind associated birth control common people everyday, plus much higher survival rate, would never experienced brain clot everyday life rare benefits vaccine stop outweighing risks mainly younger people areas virus prevalent? That's issue UK having, 40s get offered AZ anymore. see people took picture. Get inside. Shouldn‚Äôt Corona Police rounding up. heard scomo praying country deals directly Biontech? I've seen lot weird vote shit going lately theory reddit getting popular brainless masses showing up. 

Kinda like eternal September situation. makes sense, reddit news bunch past years really come head 2020 lockdown whole gme fiasco.

So bunch fukin narcs showed narc whole fucking thing up. They're winning yet, keep seeing signs facebookishness creeping in.  one positive exposure sites far. sure intentionally missing point misunderstanding situation. 

as far tell, countries around world free obtain vaccine either pfizer biontech. 
No country forced deal pfizer biontech. 
yes no? let know got wrong. 
&amp;nbsp; 
thus, arrangement rights distribution Fosun unique China. problem encompasses Taiwan. anyone asking mess - idiotic government bet wrong vaccine (Astra Zeneca), compounded abysmal rollout increasing vaccine hesitancy inconsistent messaging people complacent, counting hotel quarantine continuing keep virus out. (It didn‚Äôt)

Last week state Victoria, 6000 people vaccinated mass vax centres empty.

It took frigging outbreak caused single happless returned traveller (who actually got infected COVID another quarantine hotel resident), put 5 million us back situation matter 72 hours.

On positiv√© note - Victoria recorded phenomenal 17,000 people vaccinated last 24 hours proverbial penny dropped.

And yes, absolutely way live another 12 months - near normality fortress Australia stage 4 lockdowns drop hat :/ really, vaccine rollout picking pace nicely. risk groups largely vaccinated already almost cases. can't deny Texas Florida basically eschewed COVID controls months ago fine though. know, mechanisms entirely different, comes outcomes (brain damage death, i.e success treatment) dissimilar CVST caused birth control. thought outcomes matter person thinking taking it, underlying mechanism, no?  ... why? NSW one wide spread lockdown March til June-ish 2020. one Northern Beaches two-three weeks Christmas (that partially completely cut suburbs rest country closing three roads).

NSW handled outbreaks using contact tracing without lockdown. Lol America anything normal.

Feds need pull fingers arse vaccinations returning Australians tho. Relatively decent vaccine program? We‚Äôre behind Kazakhstan...  yesterday: Yes Lockdowns Australia actually work. downvoting guy? Hes right. zaibatsu arent dead, rebranded LDP. Uh, what? That‚Äôs true relevant. significant portion population, included, isn‚Äôt eligible vaccination yet federal leadership absolute joke. Oh makes lot sense, helps someone knowledge Aussie politics. Thanks. Yeah, logistical nightmare, might ultimate reason call cancel delay. But.. *is* path could take place, difficult one carry out.

Competitors get vaccinated home countries, additional burden Japan that. doctors nurses.. maybe there's way cover gap.. I'm really sure.. rabbit 5 years old... anything lab leak theory? I‚Äôm sure what‚Äôs Belgium‚Äôs stance question. vaccinating 45+ far I‚Äôm aware, mention something younger population‚Äôs vaccine eligibility tbh know work individual invitation get vaccinated, invitations send age, oldest first, basically even open today, I‚Äôll still wait age comes I‚Äôm invited. üòÅ

Easy fix. expecting media convey science properly, fear doomed let down. 

Media rational actors insofar push bounds wording far acceptable ensure get clicks reposts social media therefore get readers. 

If want unadulterated science, rules politicians media.  great. people go vaccine, bring vaccine people. incivil? super market See would fine quick hard lockdown, work, drug shit like immune system strong enough beat virus don‚Äôt think again? ""The US population 1.5 times greater Brazil, US reported 139 deaths children younger four years age since pandemic began""

In context, 800 children dead extremely alarming. schools opening mask mandates lifting, i'd sure hell want understand disparity kid going back school.

Heck, adults vaccinated, kids could become breeding ground new variant even dying outright. There's lot good reasons study Brazil's outbreak right now. 95 percent protection relative rate. 100 hospitalizations unvaccinated group 5 matched vaccinated group. Mine? Probably cause makes sense. FYI, user argues threads ""race exist"", posts bullshit discuss reality Asian people might get beat white people (completely ignoring actually black people).... tests Walmart 2/$20 literally dust boxes weeks.  wrote initial dust it‚Äôs still there.  No. One total area including internal waters territorial sea (12 mile zone), dry land area.   soapbox? You‚Äôre one complaining lockdown ‚Äî something *the entire world* deal with, Ontario personally. got vaccine Kroger soon eligible so. I'm hoping I'll still able enter. Another great way target homeless populations UK. Sometimes it‚Äôs hard people stay one location access direct communication lines. current political climate Hong Kong ideal vaccine roll out.

There group people absolutely refuse listen government. much 'you die, die' attitude. Sinovac absolutely question group. 

Hong Kong government highly unlikable general population, surprises there. thing quantitatively done well control spread covid strong border lockdown. significant chunk population much 'why take vaccine risk covid well controlled? I'll take vaccine go holiday'. people can't go holiday almost everyone gets vaccinated.

Local media also incredibly irresponsible. reporting every bad medical event post vaccination professional ever saying links vaccination. people get impression vaccine = death.

I've finally convinced parents Hong Kong get vaccination bugging 2 months. heard people, family friends Hong Kong seems getting loads side effects vaccination, extent aunt hospitalised shakey hands (applies Sinovac BioNTech). super concerned side effects. hand, family friends UK (including me) typical flu-like symptoms. convinced get it. Haha! Well exactly modern meant 39 That's ""can vaccine"" theory. Biontech approved 12+ now, enough doses vaccinate 12+ year olds July August, guess.

Also, German standing commission vaccination (Stiko) convinced vaccine actually great idea kids since usually mild Covid parents, grandparents etc. get vaccine. want wait data vaccine safety 12+ age group recommend vaccine kids. completely pretty much Australia living normal life past year 900 deaths. Sweden experiment highly praised year ago deaths lower GDP neighbouring countries didn‚Äôt lockdown. 
If working home week still able exercise walk pets, go shopping oppressed wow.
People pissed federal government bad vaccine rollouts state governments lockdowns thing situation like US past year. I‚Äôm sure antivax epidemiologists also peddling lies insanity. Boom, immediate fame. course not. would serious international scandal. efforts continue protect Asian Americans racist attacks. I'm sure. think take type statement need fight against.They think fake, media driven ""cold"" defeat x president. Yep, friend got perfect attendance every year high school, usually year he'd come school super sick get everyone else sick.  theory combination leaking lab accidentally picking something wet mart.

What absurd comment...It cannot BOTH. nightmare. Global vaccination absolutely arms race virus. fallout lab country blame.

So turns leaked lab, China cover up, news story cencorsed protect Asians attack? number daily shots US somewhat plateaued past two weeks. probably due 12-16 year olds eligible still better would without announcement. anyone claims infringing rights: literally free market work. Ontario lockdown since November 2019? covid anyone‚Äôs radar North America? Ontario foresight vision??! 

Also- it‚Äôs clearly real lockdown since everyone still partying gathering. Janssen Pharmaceutica vaccine branch J&amp;J. No, ""that's it!"" best evidence indicates substantial factor. Nobody saying look factors, angry people pointing factor stupid decisions made people could've helped contain spread chose to.

There reason believe seasonality significant cause United States covid problem orders magnitude Australia bit year pandemic seasons happened everywhere. certainly plenty factors population density climate.

But United States outlier high rates infection death, especially among wealthy nations. real problem offended anyone dare suggest Americans deciding wear mask caused needless death suffering. want hear it. looking every conceivable cause except anything human agency.

The problem people saying ignore factors. That's happening. problem wanting ignore discredit one obvious well substantiated factors paying attention makes feel like maybe stupid selfish actions people refused distance wear masks actually horrifying consequences. mental gymnastics performing protect thought unimpressive. Naw, cluster humanity State: Boise Translation: news sources agree like. Hamburg given least 1 dose 40.2% citizens. still 70+ year olds waiting shot (who actually tried get shot actively time instead sitting home waiting someone come inoculate them), means distribution Hamburg unfair. rule out, since German government thought would great idea give doses GPs give damn people regular patients doctor's office. sure I'd trust discount chemist chemical needw  Yes, Tucker looney ideological bent, escuse washpo otherwise rational actors attacking hypothesis lab leak Trump advocated it, making feel icky....that opposite science. one step away vaccine passports.  Ontario looking public indoor locations events.  I'd theatre would allow vaccinated medically exempt proof. flu common cold cause long-term health issues. Lockdowns allow shopping, walking pets exercise. Yeah it‚Äôs crazy, whereas people countries desperate vaccines Australian. I‚Äôm Melbourne friends there. people pretty supportive strict short. life changed expect 1 week last year, mask wearing events cancelled (except international acts) mostly thanks lockdowns people support it. also 900 deaths 2-7day lockdowns different parts country every 3-6months seems worth it. 

In terms vaccines government completely bungled it. bet heavily AstraZeneca they‚Äôre recommending anyone 50 get Pfizer there‚Äôs simply enough. want everyone offered they‚Äôre first jab end 2021 1/3 Aussies vaccine hesitant. Preprint articles require higher degree scrutiny rigor accurately evaluate many types articles. kind discussion would appropriate strictly scientific subreddit /r/COVID19.

CDC flu numbers attempt count Infections - estimate Symptomatic Cases, studies estimate asymptomatic flu rates 75% more. also know COVID Infection rate, I'm back wondering we're trying guess Infection numbers Case numbers front us?

If wanted ballpark ""current CFR"" COVID, could take Cases 3 weeks ago Deaths (21 days common diagnosis death window). 7-day average Deaths May 27 536. 7-day average Cases May 6 46,366. still gives ""estimated current COVID CFR"" 1.15% compared CDC referenced OP high end flu numbers 62k deaths 56M cases CFR (not IFR) 0.11%.

With numbers COVID still 10x deadlier recent flu, 25k cases day going result almost twice number deaths annual flu burden. So, ""down flu like levels"" yet (my whole point).

Now enough vaccinated immediately see huge drop hospitalisations together cases even though letting go restriction ~2 month now. new surge would likely look similar without added hospitalisations time.

I‚Äôm sorry I‚Äôm edge twisting facts. r/amiapiecofshit study, neutralizing activity detected 53.4% asymptomatic mildly symptomatic participants 8 months One limitation study relatively small sample size predominantly young population, lessen generalization results. Also, cross-sectional design, could obtain baseline longitudinal serum samples. 7 asymptomatic participants study, evaluated antibody responses 2 5 months infection; 5/7 (71%) positive ELISA results 2 months infection, 4/7 (57.1%) positive ELISA results 5 months infection, neutralizing antibodies 2 5 months infection (1,7). Last, could assess individual possibilities reexposure reinfection. However, unlikely humoral immunity boosted Daegu, study participants reside, April‚ÄìOctober 2020, daily incidence rate COVID-19 &lt;0.5 cases/100,000 population (14). conclusion, despite concerns waning immunity, appropriate immunoassays detect antibodies SARS-CoV-2 8 months infection asymptomatic mildly symptomatic persons.

So, limited sample size, good cross section population, 50% detection. would take huge grain salt definitely use assess personal risk.

But yeah, realize getting first shot related blood clots fun experience. feel bad getting shot (letting community down), mental health also important. hope get eventually adopt.

My SIL adopted oldest son daughter honestly CANNOT imagine family without two. :) GOOD LUCK!!!!!!!!

SIL felt strongly wanting adopt vs child, MIL adopted. SIL ended child own, they'd adopted Oldest Nephew. Pregnancy childbirth traumatic SIL like, ""Fuck shit. putting again."" going two boys.

Then one day, Middle Nephew like, IDK, 18 mos old so, lady another dept SIL's husband's work comes asks OK discuss adoption like, worked adoption agency went through, etc. He's like, ""Sure. prob.""

Turns lady's daughter pregnant wants give child adoption. SIL talk birthmom, walk like going adoptive process, etc end, Birthmom falls love SIL SO. wants adopt baby. 

SIL like, ""Uh....Hubs need discuss first."" 

Which did. planning adopt talked stuff decided, ""Yeah. gonna THIS.""

Which ended adopting daughter. :) put perspective:

‚ÄúFrail patients benefit vaccination great risk serious illness even death become infected covid-19 virus,‚Äù said Sigurd Hortemo, senior medical consultant Norwegian Medicines Agency. ‚ÄúNevertheless, expert group believes that, frail patients, common adverse reactions may contributed serious course disease.‚Äù

Don‚Äôt really blame them. $50 gift cards also limited deal: giving away exactly 2 million, first come first served.

I know fast they'll run out, can't find exact data many first timers Cali vaccinates per day. looking recent numbers, took 19 days Cali vaccinate 2 million people (this could've first second shot). that's promo might run quickly. No, I'm saying I'll stay home - stay home ""except"". I'm also telling anyone else they're feel need to. I'm literally saying *I* would prefer risking catching cold wearing mask time. clear, current CDC guidelines, need quarantine long remain asymptomatic, girlfriend needs isolate (from rest world) longer contagious. one fucking astonishes me. Like- people _that stupid_ also managed survive adulthood? Blount county full crazies. work mile away I've dealt fair share ignorant people coming place. people died today, large, got COVID weeks ago. (I vaguely recall hearing four weeks ago, average?) prevent that, would've needed get vaccinated least two weeks protection, least five weeks maximum protection.

So, people dying today chose get vaccinated *around April 15th* huge lines young people eligible states, even *March 25th* people eligible places.

I'm going blame people age 65 getting vaccinated back then. That‚Äôs said dump, jump noted data anomaly link provided. Sorry, aren‚Äôt willing fix bad data, CDC does, doesn‚Äôt mean 900+ people died yesterday. numbers much lower think overstating situation significantly misleading.

Agreed wholeheartedly. Basically spend money homeless ‚Äúwaste‚Äù Exactly. problem flu comparison crazy virus. It‚Äôs family influenza. think missing point. normal wear mask sick, means get sick less often.

Because... less illness spreads others, spread less viral particles sick.

We know say youll stay home still gotta stop 10 mins store, prob still go work, can't miss, really probably go work feeling better still symptoms.

Pre covid sure acceptable, afterward others hell even wear mask sick say stopping store, go back work early, whatever excuse puts contact others, really big inconvenience 5 10 mins? couple days work?

We effectively eliminated flu, kill 60k people yearly states alone. Colss suck to.

I think anyone unreasonable going forward sick stay home, time people back work sick going shopping etc sick. simply wearing mask rare time sick maybe year(and everyone maybe every 3 years!) couple days bad?

I even think excessive entire flu season, countries least try polite sick, polite mask up. Pre covid. understand, don‚Äôt think downvoted. That‚Äôs way going convince folks like yourself. 

Just know FDA waiting safety data. solid data (especially mRNA) year now. (Phase 1 participants got dosed April 2020) must wait prove effective minimum length time. EUA safety skip.

But research speed, still want wait (I hope don‚Äôt!) please continue wear mask socially distance keep others position safe. didn‚Äôt ‚Äòjump‚Äô, sent bunch old, previously unreported numbers.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  Fellow pregnant woman! also wfh.

I got vaccine wanted antibodies baby day 1 baby's birth. Since vaccine unlikely approved babies while, seemed like good option me. also fearful increased likelihood complications might occur became covid positive pregnant women higher risk. (I miscarried past. miscarriage unrelated covid)

**Here's ongoing list I've gathered. Maybe help:**

* website really good summary everything covid vaccine: ACOG expects based mechanism mRNA vaccines safety efficacy profile pregnant individuals would similar observed non pregnant individuals. ACOG also mentions covid vaccines live vaccines. Live vaccines recommended pregnant women increased risk baby. worth noting vaccines (like flu tdap) highly recommended pregnancy.
 
* Studies animals receiving moderna, pfizer, J&amp;J vaccine pregnancy found safety concerns according CDC. 
* vsafe app CDC tracking pregnant women. far, finding correlation pregnancy complications women vaccinated compared general background rates typical. 30,494 pregnant women registered app report came out: unexpected pregnant infant outcomes observed related covid vaccination pregnancy. also see findings summarized well: findings New England Journal Medicine, CDC recommends pregnant women get vaccinated. April 19, 2021, there's 94,000+ pregnant women vaccinated self reported Vsafe app. 
* one person study indicated women gets vaccinated pass antibody baby. found antibodies cord. one shot vaccine. 
* Here's another report 20 women got vaccine found antibodies cord. 
* Here's report 131 reproductive-age vaccine recipients (84 pregnant, 31 lactating, 16 non-pregnant) found Vaccine-generated antibodies present umbilical cord blood breastmilk samples. women similar immune responses vaccine nonpregnant women, suggesting vaccine would effective them. 
* here's report Florida vaccinated pregnant woman found antibodies baby well. 
* mRNA vaccine extremely fragile (thus stored cold temperatures) short lived. extremely unlikely mRNA able get baby placenta. 
* Conversely, multiple studies showing contacting covid pregnant symptomatic puts higher risk cesarean delivery, preterm birth, hypertensive disorders pregnancy, postpartum hemorrhage. example, here's case study possible covid transfer baby via vertical transfusion. particular case study, mother ""moderately sick"" covid week 21. Two weeks illness, ultrasound scan detected abnormalities fetus, described paper: ""Specific conditions included critical blood flow fetal umbilical artery, fetal growth restriction (1st percentile), right ventricular hypertrophy, hydropericardium, echo-characteristics hypoxic-ischemic brain injury (leukomalacia periventricular area) intraventricular hemorrhage 25th week gestation."" mother delivered week 26 prematurely child passed away 1 day 18 hours. study 2,100 pregnant women across 18 countries worldwide revealed COVID-19 associated higher risk severe maternal newborn complications previously recognised. Women COVID-19 pregnancy 50% likely experience pregnancy complications (such premature birth, pre-eclampsia, admission intensive care death) compared pregnant women unaffected COVID-19. Newborns infected women also nearly three times risk severe medical complications, admission Neonatal Intensive Care Unit ‚Äì mostly due premature birth. 
* Pfizer Moderna studied effective NY variant. Pfizer Moderna vaccines marginally less protective variant devastated Britain. interested vaccine safety long term periods, found pretty eye opening. Vaccines overall safe recalls. also worth mentioning question ""long term effects"" vaccines. Yes, know history thalidomide. worth stating though thalidomide approved FDA pregnant women US well forced drug companies even stricter regards clinical trials. Regulations grown lot since then. vaccinated Americans big plans holiday weekend? Vaccine cards look health records. That's odd, December ""US stupid follow simple rules like Australia"" reason cases then... they're food based, smart enough hop delivery bandwagon, they'll make money lockdown, not. think you‚Äôve vaccinated population Australia. This.  vaccinated day 2, 1B roll out.  12 weeks next week, unless 1A it‚Äôs pretty much next impossible both. Brain fog crops lot chronic illnesses. Maybe increased cases due Covid get researchers working it. EU scheme? getting quite lot vaccines, even month Pfizer sends 50% week. Basque Country around 50% adults first shorts 20% fully vaccinated imagine pays even keeps people ICU. That's even counting abstract externalities like loss productivity due illness shutting schools outbreak. Vaccines important long term sure, far outbreak goes, likely make little difference due time takes rollout, jabs, immunity kick in. Australia several small outbreaks like mostly gotten control. sure thing, outbreak concern, cases linked belief even without vaccines possible keep country relatively covid free. problem works cutting us rest world, viable long term. Let‚Äôs stop business travel 30 people got sick. Mmmm sounds legit Adult staff get vaccinated. Holy heck failure Japanese government, especially given (as said) people legally administer vaccine not.

However, nations private corporations want step vaccinate athletes staff games happen, *choices* Japanese government bearing. post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

Fomite transmission inefficient. aside, thought primary mode transmission even prior exposing bad science play. [CDC flu spread others 6 feet away. experts think flu viruses spread mainly droplets made people flu cough, sneeze talk. droplets land mouths noses people nearby possibly inhaled lungs. Less often, person might get flu touching surface object flu virus touching mouth, nose, possibly eyes.

Actually effective thing social distancing. difference ""we lose immunity time SARS-CoV-2 variants exposed either infection vaccination"" ""the virus mutates fashion antibodies readily produce longer effectively bind signal immune system neutralize it"". talking latter (which guaranteed thing happen), seems like lot people confusing former.

You think antibody like lock, specific virus variant (or variants) like key. antibody (lock) virus (key) bind sufficiently other, signals immune response leads neutralization virus. article shows specific ""locks"" variants exposed (through infection vaccination) appear likely go away. However, virus mutates enough, think like ""key"" changing shape enough longer fits particular ""lock"" have, therefore immune system primed neutralize it.

The question likely virus ""key"" able mutate sufficiently enough longer bound readily antibody, i.e., ""key"" longer fits ""lock"". answer ""we know"". Many researchers suggested coronaviruses mutate relatively slowly, possibility get enough population immunized mutate way evades defenses (which would mean eliminated). new variant could pop suddenly vaccines prior immunity match for. again, know happen.

They though, article increase people getting vaccinated (because any), people going website vaccines, ignores visits could (and probably were) related fact 12-15 year olds became eligible shots day CDC mask party. tough one. seem like blatant discrimination, however choice get vaccinated puts others can't, even vaccinated risk.

I wonder take account people can't get vaccine medical reasons.

I know 4 $1000.00 tickets mostly draw attention. Still though, I'm fence this. we're comparing risk caused getting vaccinated AstraZeneca risk caused Covid-19 infection, risk caused infection clearly much greater.

But proper risk assessment also factor probability becoming infected Covid-19 virus first place.

Suppose year now, prevalence Covid-19 low average person one million chance (0.000001) becoming infected. Suppose age good health, one thousand (0.001) chance dying infection. Thus, overall risk death Covid-19 would 0.000001 * 0.001, 0.000000001 - one billion. Even optimistic assessments risk death AstraZeneca *much* higher that. unvaccinated offered AstraZeneca, would perfectly rational decline. (In reality I've received one dose Pfizer far).

When read comment replied impression thinking kind scenario prevalence low. last statement referring them, think they're unduly dismissive risk Covid-19.  I'll giving money choosing travelling anymore years. Sorry brasil failed. article entirely visits certain website right around time announcement, visits actuality driven 12-15 years olds became eligible time. ""interest"" correspond actual bump shots put arms newly eligible group. amount reaching done article comments astounding. They‚Äôre implying anything, they‚Äôre saying something like isn‚Äôt quick pin origin of, gave example long took HIV/AIDS.... literally do. Mandatory vaccinations school, yellow fever passport cards, jobs mandate requirement able stand 8 hour shifts. mean actually pretty common. I'm saying darwinism false, im saying getting vaccine = death false. see what's happening India now? That's happens virus runs unimpeded population.  rest world boat us (I.e. rich western countries) way ahead vaccination effort. don‚Äôt want overly partisan think government relied heavily ‚ÄúFortress Australia‚Äù really think much aggressive pursuing vaccine contracts abroad also pushing forward licensed domestic vaccine production (by mean putting eggs one basket I.e. Queensland developed vaccine unsuccessful far I‚Äôm aware). state.

What want power. They‚Äôve able exercise power proxy due event. Need silicon? Good luck getting large quantities. virus helped strap give silicon also enforce greater control dissenters. absolutely could PR department working overdrive, cause perception here. said, find hard believe recall zero effect actions (which appears claim).

Perhaps importantly, 2022 primary approximately one year today. campaign mode, effect actions. much debate, it‚Äôs definitely zero. make worthy mentioning national article governor‚Äôs actions. E.g see study: ones gonna pay $800 lineup. comment quality band, $800 ticket would like...the best seats house massively popular act. feel like tickets show caliber wouldn‚Äôt like $20-30 normally? Free market applies fits certain narratives. complained breach NDA happened. guess pharmaceutical companies NDA pricing. smaller country, probably get price EU USA. Melbourne dweller here. don‚Äôt think majority us impacted find excessive. hate it, is.

I think majority finds vaccine rollout absolute joke something done properly, could‚Äôve prevented this. research show new variants bypass immunity past infection (notably SA Indian variants), cannot bypass vaccinated. even single dose previously infected good two doses without previous infection. 

Tldr: POV isn‚Äôt rational Pfizer reduce almost cases mild flu? Ah makes sense. Thanks! site good job removing data dumps. ""This shows incentives matter,"" said Dr. Jonathan Reiner, professor medicine surgery George Washington University School Medicine. ""People needed carrot, carrot ability drop mask settings.""

Possibly true.

I think possibilities may be

1. Procrastinators got motivated go fear many people longer masked.

2. Antivaxxers without true *conviction* felt gut level reality risk vaccinated relaxation mask guidelines.  Absolutely. I‚Äôm seeing major economic repercussions USA where, may know, never really ‚Äúlocked down‚Äù. can‚Äôt picture scene would like go route here. Looking wikipedia's age breakdown Brazil's population, Brazil roughly 15 million children 5 younger. similar percentage population infected, that's roughly 5 million cases resulting 800 deaths. 800/5000000 one hundreth percent fatality rate. higher one 10000th percent fatality rate see here? Yeah like... come on. can't seriously worried this, you? way less dangerous kids flu. like refer two parties, may start using life except MASA. (Same) 

Nothing said wrong. Even suggesting virus came China last year somehow taboo.    vaccinated, locked down. endgame achieve enough immunity population spread like wildfire. Yes, don‚Äôt discriminate people treatments, believe slippery, slippery slope. cringe see people sub eagerly ride it. It‚Äôs exactly that, really want go holiday. Overall understand we‚Äôve really good Australia, sympathy vaccine doubters usual since vaccines gone approval process faster usual. think taking slow approach mass vaccination mistake delays return normalcy extends period economic hardship caused travel restrictions, element luck lockdown process. could get unlucky large spike cases gets control time next year, people vaccinated less harmful be. 

But yeah also really want go Bali something lol. It‚Äôs ground zero lot conspiracies. CNN mayor Miami talking wanted put curfew weekend officials (I imagine DeSanctis) blocked petition, lmao put fucking curfews times? Fuck guy  understand, lot world‚Äôs lockdown‚Äôs ‚Äúsuggestions‚Äù leisure/hospitality limitations.

While we‚Äôre quite hardcore hard lockdown places, leave day supermarket, walk run exercise hour max. Saying ""we encourage stay home feel sick"" actually fostering culture people feel real option two different things. IME school districts workplaces pretty open former clue latter. death count? hear they're updating backlogged data put single day instead actual days happened? 1300 deaths recorded yesterday there's way that's real number. beat again? unvaccinated disability thus discrimination. Yup. title really misleading  person key pads. article didn‚Äôt say all....some antibodies immunity forever.

‚ÄúBut persistence antibody production, whether elicited vaccination infection, ensure long-lasting immunity COVID-19. ability emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants blunt protective effects antibodies means additional immunizations may needed restore levels, says Ellebedy. ‚ÄúMy presumption need booster.‚Äù Melbourne's last one longer week, yeah, lockdowns actually taken seriously infinitely effective. glad read update! Main takeaway:

Seriously tho humans really bad understanding human it. It‚Äôs sports solved games. happen long schools funding tied student attendance.

Have heard herd immunity? *That* magic number. 50% it.

Your point? agree 100%, ridiculous. almost YEAR prepare vaccines coming best get fucking scrap paper less security features 20 dollar bill? state failed Almost every state lets people verify validity card online Turns centralizing vaccine production dumb emergency planners told us :( yet, June.

 still ban unnecessary travel outside EU (travel within EU allowed depending country). change somewhere June. Good, would love hear Argentina findings  causes scalper vaccinate

But get vaccinated...  Forgery document crime punished 5 years prison Florida.  Yeahhhh, I‚Äôll pass. right, info quoting last year.

Still feel 16 months stretching it. Love see it. Honestly leave home reason here. gyms, bars, restaurants, personal care businesses, retail shops schools closed. Canada absolutely smashing Yeah fully vaccinated then. read anything digital green certificate rolled yet, otherwise vaccinated Americans already traveling Europe right now. would go full lockdown? confused. something odd happens, would say pretty much over,"" Baker said Friday State House Library. ""I would put asterisk anything says over, believe certainly run big way given data currently exists right now, Massachusetts place lift restrictions high degree confidence people done things needed beat thing down.""

And -- since even Massachusetts *anywhere near* 70-80% fully vaccinated necessary herd immunity -- quote make sense?

I read article made comment. stand statement.  somewhat counter said before, me, would better simply allow access unvaccinated grounds protecting everyone different price people different groups seems different almost like predatory practice .

Totally fair, I'm board. fully vaccinated, said longer 6 months believe. saying 6 months first amount time passed time. Covid still pretty new, progresses learn more. 

I could definitely wrong, believe infected body still remember past 6 months.

Also look possible later effects due infection current long carry effects people contracted disease pre vaccine still health issues. Neuro vascular problems. 10 people 50-60 degree weather pouring rain Free market also allows put terms service supply proof vaccination point immediately entry unable refunded. Paying $$$ fake piece paper could get free get covid. idiot test ages! Okay...He get vaccinated wrong say protection 6 months catching it. Paying $$$ fake piece paper could get free get covid. idiot test ages! almost like people forget rights stop mine begin vice versa...

As gay person... fucking hate god damned cake bullshit. put something tells religious. wont shop store. Trust me. dont want give money hate me. However persons harmed virus. Even ones WANT store. Idiots...  Paying $$$ fake piece paper could get free get covid. idiot test ages! People keep saying kids get flu vaccine, can‚Äôt covid! Hamburg still vaccinating 70+year olds.

Not ""only"", rather ""also"". mean, I'm Germany 30s I'm already vaccinated. might free market, someone works hospital, HIPAA violation ask anyone prove they've vaccinated anything like this. circumstances vaccines required (travel jobs), ok. people buy $18 sell $500? happen US shortly That's easy prevent asking vaccination card entry, anyways there's way check vaccination status. Don‚Äôt care you‚Äôre vaccinated, don‚Äôt care feelings this. Less war.   Yeah painting broad brush, addressing people saying vaccine doesn‚Äôt prevent disease, makes less symptoms, seems pretty common thing I‚Äôve heard people say. 

Nuance difficult, agree, something rare (spreading breakthrough case) isn‚Äôt better vaccine uptake people understand it‚Äôs extremely rare spread virus vaccinated? sure human antibody response targets spike protein? yes, vaccines target spike protein, human body might chosen characteristics virus target. entirely know things work, though. ""Unless something odd happens, would say pretty much over,"" Baker said Friday State House Library. ""I would put asterisk anything says over, believe certainly run big way given data currently exists right now, Massachusetts place lift restrictions high degree confidence people done things needed beat thing down.""

Governor Baker talking crisis COVID Massachusetts, referring state COVID within entire US. governor actually followed science listened experts, give little credit. oh wow, anyways  CoronaVac vaccine reduces coronavirus mortality 97 percent, according early results immunization campaign Uruguay, relies heavily Chinese jab Well except one still high risk community Baker probably would like wipe existence. Everything else he's done years screwed city over, stop now? wonders there's lower vaccination rate southcoast- trust state look them, ever. Look discrimination :D

But, perspective matters.

If loss 500 doctors country 1,300,000,000 people makes meaningful difference staffing levels, India way, way, way bigger problems us could imagined. One time guess? one vaccination card equals one ticket numerous stories fake 20 dollar vaccine cards available airports bars. People always find way. Imagine forging vaccination see Teenage Skinbuckets whatever guys called. Spare crap. Go Colombia. World's longest lockdowns thousands people dying COVID-19 hunger. Talk cremation center workers around country. estimate many bodies dealt last month vs year two ago. vaccinate every year flu, even covid. definitely .01%.... really dont enough data draw kind conclusion yet blatant incompetence administered 10.6 million doses Wednesday, sixth vaccine imports, based government figures. September, projected supply reach 414 million doses, double adult population requires. lot people think two outcomes either completely fine death. lot suffering grey. Make anything convenient human always likely use. Something nature. It‚Äôs bizarre check one vaccination card/person = one ticket. Ron DeSantis going stupid-idiot this. trouble loading article link sign Washington Post's [Coronavirus WP provides coronavirus content free charge newsletter. Dutch minister Health mentioned press conference expected 3 million Janssen vaccines, likely 1 million delivered time, due mishap Baltimore factory. likely delay Dutch vaccination program two weeks. God, hate idea much ONE single factory error delay situation ENTIRE country. Okay, government implements it, don‚Äôt want it/businesses require you‚Äôre beat. government won‚Äôt require anything - it‚Äôs mandated businesses. hope so, surprised either. Yes, doubt Australia done well. Sorry- clear responding propping America example worst possible response.  That's really works. Anyone ever kid kindergarten knows that. right get vaccinated. people right tell get lawn. Yea, cause we're sellign ticets 22 dollars... $978 off. No, sell scalped ticket $100 got $80 profit. need around 70 % adults vaccinated reach global safety Cov19 around 90% vaccinated adults prevent variants India, south africa etc emerge.

A pretty important difference, least now, COVID flu though people get flu every year. flu virus incredibly efficient mutating enough escape immune response without fundamentally changing become different type pathogen. COVID, it‚Äôs obviously early history can‚Äôt say sure happen, indications immunity produced previous infection vaccination going much durable, reinfections typically rare mild.

Yes herd immunity US. Apparently herd dumb.  reason give article says antibodies? help persuade parents, big articles already  So, don‚Äôt like liver. Matter fact hate it!
But would run someone wanted eat it.
I feel could apply many things. concern right mixing ‚Äúbubbles‚Äù unvaccinated people. Two different unvaccinated households wear masks preferably outdoors they‚Äôre getting together. Vaccinated people freely mix vaccinated unvaccinated people, risk catching spreading vaccinated person negligible. 

If unvaccinated people households strangers unknown vaccine status, may take masks, indoors, hug, etc. Yeah. Serbia, 90% population got Sinopharm vaccine. got covid second shot like worse cold, mild flu. great preventing spread makes covid manageable health system. think prevalence UK variant, effective spread. probably works great original covid strain us got year UK variant. depends person. people literally know nothing it. people questions easily answered. people reservations easy address.

Like said tiny minority ""I get matter what"" people providing education/encouragement aligns needs.   know breakthrough rate? effective vaccines variant? Bad bot  Love freely politicians give away money that's 20 years please. preventable Pfizer. Pfizer also vaccinating Olympians teams. make vaccines mandatory enter Japan, deploy vaccines next month fine.

Yes, struggled decide put export bans place. tried, criticised selfish thinking rest world. Hey that's hometown.

U don‚Äôt. many times going return lockdown realize fucking stupid is? choice though, governments around world don‚Äôt lock even midst extreme outbreaks.  people died. I'm saying wrong, I'm saying proponents ZT lockdown also wanted less people die.

You sound glad countries decision support available might different perspective. really. vaccine effective people want ""brand recognition"" BS. goal get many people vaccinated possible, sitting tons JJ vaccines, might well send somewhere they'll used lives saved. Easier single dose vaccine extreme cold storage requirements. I'm saying Australian governement paying incompetence. They're brave, choice.

Fellow pregnant woman here. also miscarried past, understand fears. (The miscarriage due covid. due chromosomal abnormalities common first trimester.)

I fully vaccinated got vaccine hearing complications deaths covid infected pregnant women. (Deaths mother child.)

I also got vaccine hearing likeability vaccinated moms give antibodies baby. Considering vaccine approved babies, seemed like great option me.

It's worth noting sterility rumors debunked ACOG. There's scientific evidence this. ongoing list I've gathered. Maybe help:**

* website really good summary everything covid vaccine: ACOG expects based mechanism mRNA vaccines safety efficacy profile pregnant individuals would similar observed non pregnant individuals. ACOG also mentions covid vaccines live vaccines. Live vaccines recommended pregnant women increased risk baby. worth noting vaccines (like flu tdap) highly recommended pregnancy.
 
* Studies animals receiving moderna, pfizer, J&amp;J vaccine pregnancy found safety concerns according CDC. 
* vsafe app CDC tracking pregnant women. far, finding correlation pregnancy complications women vaccinated compared general background rates typical. 30,494 pregnant women registered app report came out: unexpected pregnant infant outcomes observed related covid vaccination pregnancy. also see findings summarized well: findings New England Journal Medicine, CDC recommends pregnant women get vaccinated. April 19, 2021, there's 94,000+ pregnant women vaccinated self reported Vsafe app. 
* one person study indicated women gets vaccinated pass antibody baby. found antibodies cord. one shot vaccine. 
* Here's another report 20 women got vaccine found antibodies cord. 
* Here's report 131 reproductive-age vaccine recipients (84 pregnant, 31 lactating, 16 non-pregnant) found Vaccine-generated antibodies present umbilical cord blood breastmilk samples. women similar immune responses vaccine nonpregnant women, suggesting vaccine would effective them. 
* here's report Florida vaccinated pregnant woman found antibodies baby well. 
* mRNA vaccine extremely fragile (thus stored cold temperatures) short lived. extremely unlikely mRNA able get baby placenta. 
* Conversely, multiple studies showing contacting covid pregnant symptomatic puts higher risk cesarean delivery, preterm birth, hypertensive disorders pregnancy, postpartum hemorrhage. example, here's case study possible covid transfer baby via vertical transfusion. particular case study, mother ""moderately sick"" covid week 21. Two weeks illness, ultrasound scan detected abnormalities fetus, described paper: ""Specific conditions included critical blood flow fetal umbilical artery, fetal growth restriction (1st percentile), right ventricular hypertrophy, hydropericardium, echo-characteristics hypoxic-ischemic brain injury (leukomalacia periventricular area) intraventricular hemorrhage 25th week gestation."" mother delivered week 26 prematurely child passed away 1 day 18 hours. study 2,100 pregnant women across 18 countries worldwide revealed COVID-19 associated higher risk severe maternal newborn complications previously recognised. Women COVID-19 pregnancy 50% likely experience pregnancy complications (such premature birth, pre-eclampsia, admission intensive care death) compared pregnant women unaffected COVID-19. Newborns infected women also nearly three times risk severe medical complications, admission Neonatal Intensive Care Unit ‚Äì mostly due premature birth. 
* Pfizer Moderna studied effective NY variant. Pfizer Moderna vaccines marginally less protective variant devastated Britain. interested vaccine safety long term periods, found pretty eye opening. Vaccines overall safe recalls. also worth mentioning question ""long term effects"" vaccines. Yes, know history thalidomide. worth stating though thalidomide approved FDA pregnant women US well forced drug companies even stricter regards clinical trials. Regulations grown lot since then. pretty well managed. travelled Melbourne last week (wasn't keen work) got home blew up. still got messages updating Melbourne outbreak (and eventually directing get tested) get pass travel interstate.
