Not every single person, asymptomatic *never know they're infecting people.*  

So yes... like shooting crowd *without even realizing firearm firing.* I’ve going gym classes unmasked since day reopened here. go group class almost every single day.

""Violently ill"" fucking dude? Brain fog fatigue probably fucking psychosomatic caused chronic anxiety anyway? crap study even said 2-dose series greatly reduced symptoms, 1-dose lacking. fucking scared get booster too. 

What *your* solution? *your off* ramp? nobody gonna board shit proposing masking forever, good reason too. said ""masks didn’t help protect them"" ? Exactly people say someone killed immigrants middle eastern religious groups, right? almost seems likely antivaxers would rather entrench something like this, admit getting vaccine factor.

TLDR: You’re idiot.  Da! care workers across world using ivermectin treat covid symptoms arise since beginnjng.

No special needle needed last dose. need special needles every dose. absolutely fucking way 2-dose series little effectiveness preventing long-term symptoms. That's fucking bogus. many anti vaxxers Ireland US I've seen. Additionally, anecdotally, people know got vaccinated, got order protect vulnerable family member. 

We're small country we've quite lot cases deaths (although excess deaths appear fairly low!), quite lot us know people caught covid, died it, kind pushed lot us vaxxed too. first person know 70 offered (I'm early 30s) due health reasons, people I'm friends genuinely jealous got mine soon proves vaccine dangerous..............amirite US CDC also mostly emphasizing caseload, hospitalizations.

""Stimulus"" complete joke. Well shit. looking work AZ, since want leave WA. Lol people even give shit personal decisions health risk beyond me. I’ve never given anyone shit either wearing wearing mask. Fucking insane. bad reactions catching Covid itself? Honest question here. vaccinated Pfizer March Testing boundaries fake religious exemptions. .3% population dying fine, 0.003% population losing job refusing vaccinated crime humanity...   stupid GOP governor problem Florida. ask doctor “would doctors, specialty professional society, agree recommendation?” Masks always supposed temporary preventative measure, dude. first received vaccinations, delta goalposts moved indefinitely pissing filling dread. 

I know probably stuck reddit's echo chambers I'll give news flash: 90% people ""love"" wearing masks. matter snug try fit face 'chic' try make them, pale comparison *not* one on. 

You say ""masks reduce spread"" marginal level reduction may reduce spread disease outweigh costs all. seriously cannot imagine depressing fucking world seeing \*everyone\* wear masks time public indefinitely. society done this, even Japan.

And hospitals pretty damn serious preventing spread Covid facilities, utilizing negative-pressure rooms like, surprised patient's room paper-free zone (not legal documents, portrayed drum public outrage). Covid survives longer typical virus paper surfaces, infection risk.

No fucking way go place people bad preventing deaths.  photo must fake, I’ve never seen NYPD wear masks, let alone properly.   someone finding outlet ... *something*. You’re making absolutely fucking sense. don’t give shit talk people. people need know tiny risk issue, assuming research holds up. least one papers withdrawn. people concerned level risk avoid getting morning. actually look CDC data, you’ll see 100 per year years. 2020-2021 major outlier.

Pediatric flu death estimates likely accurate. Children die almost always undergo full autopsy. die hospital fill testing done.

Hey least arizona like florida state knowingly fudging numbers, local news today florida said covid deaths three whole days. ok True. agree. mean booster?

If 2 Pfizer, recommend person get another Pfizer instead half dose Moderna know efficacy of.

One thing sure, absolute best vaccine FULL dose Moderna. give best immediate antibody response also long lasting. 

Next might full dose Pfizer. good full dose Moderna honorable second. 

Finally bottom rung would 10 mcg Pfizer 50 Mcg Moderna. reduced doses given children people already immunity prior doses natural infection. Neither would efficacious.  We'll see.

It’s pretty tight room.  taste like crap days also…  One possible influence maybe ""upscale"" people got shot think need wear mask help stop spread.

Or maybe feel entitled anything help stop spread.  Florida says otherwise mean similar adult doses right? Moderna 3x much dosage end gave equivalent response. However factor time, fact Moderna effective +6 months due higher dosage better vaccine overall? 

I think focusing immediate benefits, agree same, long term effectiveness matters, perhaps logic higher dose. fair, area pretty intolerable pre covid...(is joke...kinda...ok joking).  seas full faces BBworks Jambajuice even thicker before. thing think different people different risk tolerances. people okay leaving house all, okay going stores mask, others okay wearing mask sometimes still okay eating even perfect.

I’m thinking normal people world stop caring pandemic shots go kids. people change. Last month patient still refuse vaccine dad brother died COVID week. lead horse water.   True. consider Pfizer seems efficacious lower doses.

For instance children 5-11 FDA approving either:

10 Mcg Pfizer Moderna 50 Mcg.

So means even 10 Mcg Pfizer give equivalent response 50 Mcg Moderna - look recommended dosage Children.

SMDH media outlets led extremism populace really held responsible. 

The amount death threats public figures, officials, servants trying help us jobs really sad frightening.  People really really bad evaluating comparing risks objectively. lot whether feel like control not. example, risks associated driving pretty high (I googling said lifetime risk dying car accident 1/600 far 1/300 number quoted), many people feel safe control they're ones driving car. think vaccine fears partly fueled feeling lack control, trust complicated process (vaccine development/manufacturing) that's hands.  guess so. still making sense would choose example. Yeah much covid horrible messaging. Like even telling people 4th shots needed some. People make joke it. Get people first shots telling news stations rounds same. Absolutely agreed. Thanks taking time provide link I'll check it
out.

Here's understanding:

Covid, transferred mucus, infectious
 mostly touch, also airborne risks.

Human coronaviruses measure 0.1 0.2 microns, generally 100-125 nanometers size,
and easily pass plain cloth barriers.
An n95 mask filter .30 microns.

Common surgical masks made Polypropylene fibers, supposed filter particles 1 micron although efficiency widely debated.

If person sneezes coughs mask would help contain mucus, reverse,
the masks may well block virus-laden droplets virus still infectious mask. The
water molecules evaporate virii can/will get inhaled. 

Surgical masks may effective soaked brine, killing virii contact.

Inertial impaction, interception, diffusion; virus small diffused. molecule evaporate virus inhaled really nailing GOP base too. math Florida probably going lose GOP vote edge 10-15%... isn't. Could error end.   I’ve seen decent amount people comment symptoms type 2 diabetes covid positive page getting diagnosed covid studies showing same. horrible!  someone Evangelical Christian uncle (and family) refuses get vaccine “that’s god’s plan”, correlation way, way higher Christians want admit.  Turns place healthcare services doesn’t think Covid hoax. Okay, would want discuss pediatrician? Rushed?

mRNA technology works almost 30 years, Covid vaccines using mRNA effectively tweaked versions ones developed 2003 first SARS outbreak. Furthermore, thanks modern computer technology investment research DNA sequencing, including entire human genome, able isolate map specific spike proteins particular virus time span would unheard decades ago. Understand research, development, testing performed remarkable amount funding, performed simultaneously hundreds teams around world.

The speed vaccine made available testament capabilities modern science medicine, something celebrated, feared. read Harvey Birdman's voice. definitely benefit. I'm parent well, 3 yr old. soon approve age, get it. We'll discuss pediatrician first, see reason she'd recommend it. Wait explain wasn’t trolling? Genuine question. Could please find 5-7 sources examples. I’m waiting. degen42069, want open dialog. Please convince me!  remember listening virologist NPR month pandemic said basically respiratory viruses airborne worried transmission via fomites....so yeah CDC basically put corner.    stats lag infections ~8 days. Cases dropping UK particular stats still going due previous increases cases.  commandment, summed saying, namely, “You shall love neighbor yourself.” *Love harm neighbor; therefore love fulfillment law.*

I think balance risk shifted substantially, scientific position start opening up.   Lol, isn't. violated health department order. Thats goes. rules written blood. 700k+ Americans dead disease, idiot wants ""go day"".

How much selfish piece shit be? painfully obvious medical knowledge based “explained” that. Bet lot “own research.”
PS. Covid causes pneumonia. yeah… subtracting subset population whose causes death listed Covid pneumonia—and calling “other causes”—-is huge miss, pal.  Woo interpretation- touch grass could mean grounding (presumably reality). whole ivermectin treatment come about? ringleader started nonsense? Hmm, one less burger joint world, sorry that. However, sorry employees lost livelihood. Yes UK wide problem. problem primarily result Tory govt policies. cannot pass buck one. long term problem occurred many times pre Covid.

To point ... arguing **all** Covid due obesity preconditions.

No, one would ever say ""all"" meaning 100.0%, (perhaps 'we') think overwhelming majority case-load due obesity (and comorbidities arise that), advanced age (can't anything latter).

Also, pulling subject data actual study .... BMI three groups right 30.0. critical group 30.2. u/whichwitch9 points out, obesity overweight might thing point.  IDK man ...maybe ""all"" due obesity (or ""overweight""ness). would lead believe obesity bigger risk (or big risk) conditions (heart disease diabetes) subjects said have, qualified ""healthy young people"". researchers studied 72 hospitalized COVID-19 patients age 50, including 47 critically ill 25 non-critical illness, plus 22 healthy volunteers. None patients chronic conditions known increase risk poor outcomes, heart disease diabetes.

It directed first, much moreso; big part gets keeps power.

Who coulda known pandemic would make things complicated? /s thought getting booster shot preventing unvaccinated person getting vaccinated, would hold getting it. state still 47% vaccinated. rate spiked back August, already fallen lowest weeks since vaccines rolled out.

I even see state reaching 50% year. bet got booster shot. I'm protecting unvaccinated point. That's plan. Shot 4 Feb. Edit: time might mix things Moderna. TBD.  that's call Venn diagram hell. specifies immunocompromised, .. example take RA (rheumatoid arthritis). RA caused immune system attacking patients joints, .. basically immobilizing “stone”-like matrix body attacks it’s connective tissues. Therefore RA patients need medications suppress immune systems … leaving vulnerable. something like COVID, it’s double-whammy (medical term) .. vaccines work *activating* said immune system. Oh, 100%. don’t know medical professionals seriously advising it. husband’s cousin EMT, also advised get it, wild. Never fear, got anyway! Good luck!  really want anger you, explain position. First let start saying, vaccinated, family vaccinated. got job related booster shot already. believe vaccination. think get everyone vaccinated. issue like forcing people medical procedure will. makes bad person, guess bad person. registered Psychiatrist former Brain Surgeon tell true. also new variants  Agreed. need whole new medical system, really… they’ll never leave AZ. main reason vaccinate children, huge reservoir virus spreading schools bringing home. they’re vaccinated helps reduce spread virus whole population, there’s less virus less people get it. Obviously it’s also great make covid related illnesses (Covid, mis-c, long covid, long term issues related covid) vaccine preventable. Yes, private citizen choose ignore law. get caught prosecuted. consequences. different private business?

We know immunity goes time, infections vaccines; know exactly much fast, probably different vaccine, may depend hard infection hit you. also know long re-infections/boosters extend it.

With luck, wave vaccinations/boosters (which slowly growing, grow good chunk if/when 5-11yo get approved) mean get big waves.   there's outbreak somewhere China, NY Times argues time China let rip. every time, China controls outbreak within weeks. good thing NY Times run China CDC. doses Moderna. First dose minor soreness site injection nothing more. second dose nothing next day felt lethargic muscle aches (so, since I'm retired, went back bed 😀) then, said, booster dose absolutely nothing.

Thanks correction; mistakenly use total population number. Still, even elderly vulnerable, less 70% fully date vaccination. less 50% 12-17 year olds fully vaccinated despite approved 5 months ago us experiencing Delta wave. People increasingly caring virus expect we're already worst it.

Expecting children mass vaccinated seems overly optimistic. best, we'll 50% 5-11 vaccinated start next school year August/September unless winter wave much worse Delta wave many schools mandate them. Cries AZ dipped ~30% summer high ( two months) showing worrying signs even even slow decline may over. Though hard tell constant reporting failures health department. reasonable assume vaccine boosters take time reach full effect previous shots did? hard data this? Thanks. piece puzzle missing virus constantly mutating anyways. That's reproduction works, every organism, always creates mutations. vaccine may wipe everything mutants make mutants easier find, vaccine cause mutants, already there. Now, use vaccine everywhere, less Coronaviruses reproducing, creating less mutants. Sorry, I'm U.S. place name In&amp;Out ""dining rooms"" ? as, fire cure cancer covid well!

CDC FluView, though trying go data kind frustrating since limits 4 seasons time. fairly high year year. CDC data includes laboratory confirmed cases reported Influenza-Associated Pediatric Mortality Surveillance System (somewhat old) estimates put true figure double reported number. Thank sacrifices! important distinction.

The case fatality rate Covid 2%. since everyone caught covid, actual death rate population date necessarily lower that. must likely common old. However, studies involving COVID looking elderly larger effects overall. However, finding long COVID kids even found least likely problems. Vaccinations surely help. Although, endemic mutations occur. efficacy already decreased vaccines. 

Plus, know everything keep family that's older getting succeeded. might right might end sure still. 

Well, data come probably 5 10 years road.

Mind you, logistically/geographically, Ireland much easier vaccinate one factors there. Also bit outbreak whereas NZ driver within population. take anything away Ireland success btw! Kids likely get myocarditis COVID vaccine. Sure, whenever trade human lives economical gain, eyes, wrong.

These tradeoffs happen everywhere. obvious road/highway standards. make rails completely impervious crash, adjust turns reduce accidents, etc. costs lot money. Engineers literally look dollars vs. lives potentially saved.

I know comparing covid flu taboo here, clearly closing restaurants, schools restricting air travel reduces flu cases thus deaths, permanently this? course not. requirements dining rooms stay open onerous, shut dining rooms themselves. Ignoring law authorities shut qualify profile courage.   Yes. Similar second shot, milder. Fatigue, mild headache, slight sense general malaise. could taken Pfizer.

We going get Covid, when. know someone 50s double vaccinated twice year! spread around, even vaccinated. Singapore 84% population vaccinated, everyone wears masks, heavy restrictions. Yet still cases rise.

What's relevant Singapore related capacity planning ICU beds. Cases leading factor yes, 1000 cases young people double vaccinated okay. 1000 elderly unvaccinated massive challenge.

We report flu cases media, every day. report deaths often. need live Covid means jumping increase cases every 2 seconds.  study states ages patients ranged 51 81, none takes account vaccinations and/or boosters. long term symptoms indeed common COVID, they're astronomically common old unvaccinated.

I understand trying help, reason I'm worried. I'm vaccinated young. Every day risk, brutal car accidents, falls, earthquakes, etc. happen potential completely ruin life forever. [Influenza shown long-term symptoms people want extra protection long-term symptoms COVID, they'll get boosters. well 1 61 people get covid. also average across age groups, groups ratio much worse It’s followup old research Washington University St  im really confused.

If trial enough one drug celebrating Merck? single trial result far.  true year isolation, we’re likely susceptible viral illnesses (flu etc)? Oh wow know multiple big cat deaths due covid.

Better keep housecats healthy fit. Nobody singled out. public heath requirement people choosing ignore. self selecting subset like people choose drive drunk lose license.

The brain fog refer anxiety like brain fog due brain inflammation. 

Again, honestly care believe me. put information try help people. different refusing vaccine believe it. Finally! Something get excited about! Covid - Covid - 1 61 die

Whoa fuck! know 61 people know anyone who'd died it, places like NY something they're close together 1 61 people dead shit? Holy fuck ... talked friend whose two kids part Pfizer trial Bay Area. said kids never tested COVID trial, checked symptoms. also check antibodies trial either.

Isn't kind weird? idea whether prevents asymptomatic COVID infection, know delta, asymptomatic patients high viral load symptomatic patients. could spread disease. already know kids high percentage asymptomatic infections (I think least 45%).

How reliably say prevents infection without data?

And since test antibodies, 1.5 years pandemic, even know kids already preexisting immunity. Bubonic Plague took ~1400 years clear.

All wanting told do. Hope feel better soon! previous infection last December really rough. got fully vaccinated moderna end march currently mom (who living me) infected Delta far I’ve testing negative. wonder people would react booster multiple infections shots Immediate vaccination ALWAYS Recommended  Social media algorithms 24 hour news independently hit key turn human brain putty -- 50% outrage 50% telling people want hear. arm still tender injection site
I remember studie showed something like 50-75% people get tenderness across vaccines. mean flu shot make feel too, really natural reaction shots. . I'm 100% back yet definitely want feel better get booster since side effects shots. revealed vs stated preference thing. shows sorts ways. I'm shocked public health people realize this. 

TL;DR people SAY WANT, able receive financial assistance cancer treatment? adopt contrarian views social groupthink cohesion, whatever feeds grandiose self.  going say this- we’re waiting patiently vaccine supposed matter weeks weeks ago. Unless never want international tourism ever again.  Therapy helpful circumstances.   Penn Teller show called Bullshit talk numbers one episode. gist minds can't really understand huge numbers. 500 gets close upper limit. Maybe even thousand comprehend. million certainly billion.

That's 99% equally united billionaires. understand ""guy little money"" ""guy big money."" emotional reaction idea billionaire much different idea millionaire. ""guy big money.""

Logically know millionaire business owner could someone ran corner store efficiently 40 years billionaire launch space. words numbers matter much visceral level. Get it. I’m forties busy retail job got Moderna booster yesterday.

I qualified two categories - underlying medical condition (overweight/obese) high risk job (I’m surrounded 1-3k people daily, lots kids).

We get way, way many unvaxxed kids adults location. don’t want infected get sick myself.

And since couldn’t get traveling holidays spending time elderly relatives, make less nervous that. Give week two.  Remember, deaths lots causes - Covid killing grandpa cancer gets chance. (see Colin. Powell)

Additionally believe AZ fairly poor state, would mean poverty also extra risk factor. don’t believe true. Unvaccinated people intentionally getting anyone else killed. can’t discern real evidence vs meme research, doesn’t make murders. really want everyone applying pure logic looking antibodies effectiveness here? everyone one would get boosts vaccines. really want public health outcome too? Moderna doses left plenty JnJ Pfizer doses left. ship countries? look good either.

At point sticking works fine best recipient gotten dose probably expect similar side effects. They're comfortable known safe combination. not? decision what's absolute best effectiveness. get booster even delta infection? course disagree perspective together. never mentioned term freedoms. understand freedoms come responsibility. also understand society needs move forward. missed 18 months worth school. thousands businesses never reopen. people scared mind covid. mental health country taken nosedive. effective vaccine fact three them. widely available, free. People make choice. want safe, get vaccinated. they've made choice, much encourage vaccinated. 

Moving best interest country. continual fixation covid healthy. fact argue bigger risk today covid. People like others thread want obsess covid forever. Much country already moved on. behavior needs change yours. still think best wait turn,

There current prioritization. direction based perceived effectiveness priority queuing. wait 6 month mark, ""its turn"" effective. Oh that's cool, wonder mine would help too. I'm vaxxed all, still curious. &amp;#x200B;

Go it. issue personal decision end. Technically may ""best"" highest amount antibodies case stay Moderna, end day practical effect. someone 3 Pfizer doses going ot significantly worse 2 Pfizers + 1/2 Moderna boost? might negligible difference risk end, even single individual, going broadly change way case trends end city/county/state level?

And let's say Moderna golden vaccine. start announcing everyone starts avoiding others? throw away J&amp;J vaccines Pfizer doses? ship countries? mean look good either. problem J&amp;J vaccine begin with. know studies show 3rd place, public campaigns focus trying soothe people differences moving goalposts ICU % prevention death prevention. want discourage anyone getting it, clear public already dissuaded.

I think point we're saying everyone ""just get shot worry small differences"" maybe here.

That mean can't debate love get data on, end day clinic need make choice. think there's really wrong choice either whether want go gut feeling, sticking manufacturer, going optimal antibodies, fine.

OC isnt' saying stick works best. They're saying tried it, works--no terrible reactions want deal ever again, studies show effective. Studies also show 3rd dose Pfizer effective, stick that? Poor people can't afford get sick. Even someone ignorant enough believe ""just flu"" realize even flu means can't go work least days. Poor people live check check luxury missing days work. got booster weekend. Third dose moderna knocked out. High fever, tons aches felt sick. didn’t side effects 1 2 surprised. buy N95, KN95, FFP2 mask

those ""stop 95+ % submicron particles ever greater % droplets aerosols"", fully concur.

All somewhat closer respirators 
N95/P2000 filters. work , assertion
that plain cloth masks protect crowd the
individual. “There’s reason walking around mask. you’re middle outbreak, wearing mask might make people feel little bit better might even block droplet, it’s providing perfect protection people think is. And, often, unintended consequences — people keep fiddling mask keep touching face.” 
\--Dr. Fauci March 8th 2020

&amp;#x200B;

Seems pretty clear saying masks almost condescending it. go changing history. think uk right thing, vaccines, choose wear mask want. disease spread anyway. Ah, thanks, always make mistake  clarify...0.3% total state population died COVID 2% Arizonians caught coronavirus died it. OK, I'm open minded corrected; watch  That's whole lotta GoFundMe's. whole thread started saying like idea. much honest be? sure italicized ""you."" Maybe elaborate?

Sure last part. completely lost perspective covid. 

*We* problem. People like *you* are. ones think 700000 dead Americans enough convincing reason change behavior. 

...because, y'know, FREEDOM... one buzzwords used people unwilling recognize freedoms come *responsibilities*.  

That's stressed *you*.  acting like giving people CFS like problems. wrecking people's GI, vascular, eyes, ears, kidneys.  downplaying something literally destroying young healthy people.  New Zealand boarder United Kingdom Fuster Cluck. I'd worried 3rd population lost way... social fabric broken, antivax fault ...its whole bunch things get us point. Oh bet. relative lives right ccv church 67th happy valley I'm familiar. area probably even more... way I'm (south I10, west 101). .3% primarily kids 10 opposed adults 60 entire country would either still shut right we'd 95% vaccinated. thank A-Orr set circumstances didn’t find one mention kind face covering. Massive diff bt cloth KF94 N95. many months still aren’t bringing quality discussion  It’s classical trolley problem thinking. feels better kill 5 people inaction sacrifice one life save 5 action.

And add another wrench mix, they're also fully convinced ""5 people killed inaction"" really old generally unhealthy going die anyway. like, minds least, intentionally kill 1 person would otherwise lived another healthy 50 years save 5 people going die within next year anyway? still expecting recieve EUA. They'll filing end November December FDA.

US small market them, think want get markets approved working US.

I assume Novovax preferred booster next fall, due effectiveness, safety, ease storage. record, 0.3% US population died WWII. That’s small number  school plan enough time daily schedule regular teaching curriculum start year provide enough time students wash hands soap water outdoor playing eating lunch using hand sanitizer lining lunch. imagine sizes bricks would shit coordinate whole-school vaccinations. department ""duh"" might add drive this. dangerous. lot sedative non sedative antihistamines mixed together. doctor direction. need sure check immunologist safe since everyone different.
Whatever do, avoid steroids tho. causes immuno-suppression. won’t get right amount protection virus. Make sure get shot near hospital ems present. go pharmacy ready adverse reactions. agree, exclude privileges access overwhelmed critical services. would draw line right make living, access food housing. definitely fine line demonstrated thread. study also uses 577 days cumulative COVID data compare year causes. methodology study place. Really would take grain salt. Kids 2019 debating mask effectiveness mostly arguing Batman.  find keeping whole discussion masks going moot. vaccines, focusing vaccinating people (hopefully), kids. people don’t want piece cloth mouths, generates anxiety hate it… sell vaccine. think anymore. Global [dose dropped 1/3, even though manufacturing capacity continuing rise. We're issues demand, logistics, possibly finding someone pay doses. We've given 7 billion doses [now making 1.6 billion appreciate response. like specific fact find fascinating 12 people died direct result water crisis flint number people undoubtedly affected rest lives much greater. case flint number deaths talking point focus, reason covid people seem hyperfixated deaths completely ignoring potential life long damage.  Thank you. Honestly safer job area, would there. I'm hoping hope vaccine mandate Biden's teeth.    Since first dose produced essentially none heart problems showed young males second dose new kids dose one third adult dose parents definitely get first dose kids arms. particularly important kids insane school district without vaccine mandate. agree. never understood message defied basic common sense. course masks protect others. entire pandemic worn mask protect ME. End of. traditional vaccine likely means less side effects mRNA. People won’t feel shitty next day average. Pretty sure Lol not. freedom infect people‽   

^^^^^^^/s  followed science economics Hasn’t Ireland thousands deaths NZ like 20? difference two mRNA vaccines minimal right 2 weeks second dose, 6 months road, waning efficacy definitely showed separation, alone, seeking maximum protection, Moderna makes sense. That's getting at. collapse Soviet Union basically fucked every one constituent countries, unfortunately. generally find Soviet Union great (not even truly union soviets), dissolution crime citizens.  got trouble AIDS crisis generous learned lesson. great shows shaming corporations long term positive effects. Dumb dumb dumb able keep isolated it. Nope. n95 masks refuse shave beard. don’t really wear mask much anymore anyways. Covid two shots, I’m likely much threat spreading Post viral illnesses thing existed covid who's posting misinformation now, huh? China fair number countries vaccinating 3+, course they're using inactivated vaccines minimal side effects easy decision. Western democracies chosen use vaccines, fallen behind protecting children.

But again, whether we're *yet*, obviously could be. We're *choosing* give third doses general population first doses 5-11, even though know would highly effective reducing transmission.

Vaccines enough turn around Delta end pandemic. choose so. Nope, it’s constantly shifting goalposts.

Teacher: Yesterday finished talking 2010s decade. going talk 2020s decade starting year 2022.

Student: 2020 2021?

Teacher: ever speak years. caveats put front qualifies. Like I'm elevated risk category work somewhere justify getting took last week (I got vaccinated March too) convince it. used ""hey want see grandparents parents (who far risk) holidays, makes sense now"" got brain gear. Impenetrable long $10 ladder

Or plane ticket

Is really ""penetration"" step section collapsed due shoddy construction quality? That’s first time I’ve heard Type 2 diabetes long covid symptom. Seriously!? Sorry, report highly misleading. even state data AZ public health (but news story). use annualized rates causes (from 2019), nearly two years cumulative data COVID. Would much representative reality annualized COVID data, perhaps generated headline. Get it. painless side effects. one: one: one: video CNN, show clip clip clip Fox encouraging anti-vax rhetoric. important getting Pfizer doses. best guess sizeable chunk take “traditional” shot won’t take mRNA vector vaccines. Maybe large I’d honestly guess 5-10% population would swayed traditional “it’s dead COVID” vaccine protein shot NVAX GSK working on.

I'm sure. also anti-vaxers think vaccine containing parts actual virus means get infected vaccine. I'm even sure understand viral vector mRNA type vaccine.  IIRC asthma inhaler, antihistamines matters suppresses immune response. 

So maybe lady gave full dosage based fact using asthma inhalers. difference 2-dose regimen moderna pfizer trivially small compared good 3-dose regimen is. 3-dose smaller dose size fewer side effects (and we'd get way doses that, need it).

It's side effects huge problem short term, *way* higher vaccines previous ones (except smallpox vaccine). there's reason think side effects necessary. Yeah, got first two shots. infront hospital 30 minutes talked mother since working could help needed. problem I'm facing wife front line two years biggest hospital Varna (Sveta Marina) 90% covid patients pass risk fucking high (since working x-ray/scanner). hey, hope get vaccinated little calm her. Except best estimates I’ve seen put COVID infection rate pediatric population 42% US. don’t think would call 42% population infected “protected”. suspect vaccine trials collected data long-term symptoms boosters would recommended lot people. It’s typically closer 200 Influenza, misses lot typically test flu lot less testing Covid.   Walgreens CVS seem limited capacity, there's lot public vaccine shot sites availability left right. looked Safeways well day next day availability. also checked Santa Clara County vaccination sites wide availability every single day.

I suspect CVS/Walgreens probably ramped vaccine sites would previously tents setup cleared room inside make space vaccines, 1 person giving shots site capacity extremely limited (compared earlier spring). No. all.  level, one permanently losing taste smell form flu. Misinformation. think we're past point allowing people choose get vaccine zero consequence ok. 

Vaccine mandates constitutional. established long ago. anybody who's gone public school needed pile shots first. Directly study least one COVID-19 vaccine dose associated significantly lower risk respiratory failure, ICU admission, intubation/ventilation, hypoxaemia, oxygen requirement, hypercoagulopathy/venous thromboembolism, seizures, psychotic disorder, hair loss (each composite endpoints death account competing risks; HR 0.70-0.83, Bonferroni-corrected p&lt;.05), outcomes, including long-COVID features, renal disease, mood, anxiety, sleep disorders. **Receiving 2 vaccine doses associated lower risks outcomes.**

This clickbait.  Worried niece tbh. Hope smaller dosage aspiration needle lessens chance myocarditis. brother gonna talk pediatrician spacing 1st 2nd shot recommended 3 weeks know Ireland longest closure pubs Europe, world?  Never get Irishman, ability enjoy pub. That's completely amateur take it, I'm sticking it. want PPE hoarding enough hospital staff. lied general public. Consulting specialist best do.



When got vaccinated, waited 30 min Pirogov hospital parking lot, right front hospital building. friend talking phone, case made severe allergic reaction vaccine. needed someone calling 112 tell happened.  Eastern Europe learning nothing going head little restrictions poorly vaccinated populations.   Preach, Hatter! partner line cook busiest restaurant college town. He’s Covid. bought gigantic box kn95 masks back January 2020 (yeah… I’m news nerd. saw videos coming Wuhan early on), he’s worn since lockdowns. He’s never caught it. one works caught it. Good masks worn well work.

An aside… partner hiked Appalachia Trail back 80s, trail name Mad Hatter. People say every holiday event, seem correlation things covid waves. still think best wait turn, that's me. BMI 25 qualifier elevated risk pretty generous, opens 70% American population. guess big rush state (CA) already late get everyone shots many us get 2nd doses til May, meaning we're still waiting 6 months timeline.

I tried providers seems like they're making certify certain group, got shot, feel less ethical gray area compared jumping line back March/April. issues fault definitely lie media they’ve framed things throughout pandemic. metric always raw number “cases”, we’ll never allowed go back normal. Whatever, don’t like I’ll stay home spend money places. use ""humanity"" China sentence? sane population. got appointment Bay easily weekend rolled days later places looked booked up. likely. Data clinical trial shows much lower rate local systemic reactions 5-11 group. Thing they're *not* forced vaccinate will. coerced? Heavily influenced possible loss income, loss ability go places participate activities? Sure.

But forced. They're held gunpoint they're getting jabbed. Neither rounded thrown jail concentration camps.

Rather, non-autonomy-violating consequences voluntarily vaccinated global pandemic. lose certain privileges lose quality life result, including associating growing number people longer want associate them. Head injuries inan accident getting accident two separate things. Amen. Biggest hypocrites planet. that's lot people riding get safe infrastructure. (And understanding, drivers also ride) Yes, that's science works, big part point. read carefully respond, that's twice short amount time. sounds nice unfortunately data isn’t side:

Singapore 85% vaccination currently going one highest case rates deaths per no, 85% vax rate completely cure problem unfortunately. makes absolutely sense. Someone misunderstood. They're really fun part number 48% probably actually right. Certainly plausible number. Yes I'm hopeful could nail pandemic coffin.

Lol picked username long ago combining random stuff found something readable taken vaccinated not? CDC specifically saying it’s OK time. One arm. ACIP reviewed study looking this— difference immunogenicity side effects flu Moderna given time.  


Original rec 2 wk wait track side effects. I'm still going bars, since wife vaccinated (we talk doctor/professor/deacon) since bad allergy eggs. (if can) vaccinated return mostly normal life (to excluding 7 year old son, pretty terrified him. sons high school largest HS state. went “masks optional” 2 weeks ago due less 2% quarantine rate. provide quarantine figures every Friday along many cases reported many close contacts. I’m interested weeks report. cloth masks, taken away supply. even look stuff criticize  bartend San Diego got booster shot. definitely qualify. People work person general public definitely risk. exposed lot. I’d say go get booster!  started say people animals, fellow animals malicious nasty like this. Yep. hard thing study idea it. one counter-intuitive results grabs headlines, usually turns really true. even sure passes basic credibility tests claiming 40% increase. That's sort thing people would notice even without fancy statistics.

I mean, might believe full-face helmet wearers 40% increase injuries road helmet wearers, former spend time stuff like this:   adults find Moderna's higher dose ends lasting longer? Chances two kids one getting Moderna one getting Pfizer still healthy 6 months later, statistically speaking, might well outcome adults Moderna ends protection.

I hate one pick choose seeing vaccines WIDELY available US choose 3 easily, think unreasonable want pick ""best"" choice. Spoiler alert: every respiratory disease result long haul illness. thing unique Covid. probably judging CA Bay Area next impossible book March April, yes there's demand boosters, insanely easy find booster appointment Bay Area via Walgreens CVS. tried metro areas could get day / next day appointments super easily. really idiots though. get low mortality rate comparing number deaths whole population, rather looking deaths compared cases infection (which, last time checked, put true figure somewhere 2% 3%, 10 times higher normally cite). step covid? Damn, man, I’m sorry deal that. Frankly, would’ve personally quit tried find new/safer/less stressful job, actually give props able handle shit. wait. Get protected now. can’t compare two different products ug ug. Also knows Moderna authorized, when? age 12-17 application delayed review may cause myocarditis Pfizer.  


A bird hand… help something like 2-3 months ago American Academy Pediatrics (AAP), think like biggest group pediatricians country, told FDA/CDC speed heck b/c AAP reason believe vaccines unsafe kids.

Yet several months since sent letter and... are... 5-11 still quite eligible, 0-4 still least 2-3 months away probably.

When AAP basically saying going safe, please get approved... certainly creates temptation go ahead conveniently forget 4.5 year old quite 5 yet... Unhinged lunatics. 

The amount nutjobs threatened violence past years, reasons related COVID otherwise, really disturbing. 

They certainly forfeited whatever moral highground perceive type behavior.  one ran guy got ride home cop?  article October last year… Cases does, much pre vaccine. average impact per case much, much lower, majority vaccinated. Oh, misunderstood. Yeah, case sympathize. enough data. 60 years old I'd go it. Except today. Trend line 7-day average daily cases went first time many weeks. Hoping it’s blip. Thats bit stretch. Maybe shooting nursing home. crowd.    It'll hospital. AD this. practically full legal coverage. 

It's insane protection police politicians get. wife SLP liability jobs matter LCSW either groups dealing public. That's plan, got card back work. schedule weekend though Im allowed work getting it.  vax stations every Out, Covid gone 60 days. Ya welcome next one gonna cost ya. Corona unleashing unvaccinated. Long COVID psychosomatic, except actual lung/heart/organ damage. meant booster shot  Yeah guess right, thinking. Smoking drunk driving never killed anyone.......oh wait I'm 100% certain wrong. trip Arizona planned Thanksgiving week cancelled. tourist dollars get … together. seem quite obsessed Covid expense anything else. doesn’t seem healthy. would actually take move it? people, especially UK, realising everything realistically done done need get life. increasingly concluding rational position. 

75% kids infected already consequences. Long Covid largely undefined, often anecdotal overhyped constantly misleading statistics. Sure, happens sometimes basically everyone vaccinated it’s even remotely compelling reason continuing live miserable conditions much last 18 months.

Outside Reddit, people going out, going bars, restaurants, clubs, concerts, going dates, meeting new people enjoying actually living live again. We’ve 3 months UK looks like cases peaked falling again, current models suggest even expect substantial decline cases coming weeks months. vaccines work, boosters help even more. It’s time people find hobbies judging others living normal life. British health service NHS sounding alarm. clinics overloaded rapid increase new corona infections. admission patients brought clinics ambulance takes far long. Normally, takeover take maximum 15 minutes, meanwhile time increased tenfold cases. Ambulances queuing front emergency investigation opened city Worcester patient died waiting five hours ambulance outside door Worcestershire Royal Hospital. Cambridge, woman died similar case. [Translated german] Lemme guess, obesity #2. 2 257 locations. Wow. newsworthy event. anecdata anecdata. BTW vaccinated never got living TX. Hahaha that’s brilliant. However, given sexual side effects drugs maybe goal temporarily keep reproducing??  fact, 41% Democrats replied least 50% unvaccinated people hospitalized due COVID-19.’”

I’d call significant overestimation.

Also ”millions people” sounds scary, think numbers percentage. Doesn’t sound scary anymore way. US makes 1 million, that’s still 0.3%. elderly infirm. Simply bad diseases faced grandparent. mean yeah hand like… that’s improving state tbh. Can’t wait wear forever !  Nobody’s expects….THE ATTORNEY GENERAL!  Honestly funny least folks used acknowledge concept needing new plague.  say roll lot gun safety programs let rest. cannot kill freely.



You protect yourself, correct. However, slap pull gun kill me, still going behind bars murder. person responding seemed imply otherwise.  Seriously. point we’re multiple 9/11s week nobody cares. people understand, 40M Americans infected 320M

This 12%

If journey US infected, that's La New York.

A road trip would still Vegas.

Luckily half country vaccinated.

There still room 3x die. Sure, crazy still crazy, significant amount people worried ""this vaccine change DNA"" bullshit...so waiting Novavax ""not DNA changing"" vaccine. Also, tend think mRNA vaccines developed fast (ignoring 30 years research mRNA many fields made vaccine possible short time), Novavax also seems like legit option, even though developed around time, approved two years outbreak.  loathe people like that. I’d kill one action save two, let alone five. Well, country bare minimum citizens probably happening. friend dealing liver possible kidney failure it. Preexisting autoimmune conditions let opportunistic infections run wild got Covid (couldn’t get vaxxed numerous issues).   bright side, sabotaging data prevent noticing badly screwed gerrrymandered districts. gerrymander distinct constantly undergoing population change? This.

Bleak outcome would case first everyone looking n95+ masks beginning..

Most even know wear them.

I good stockpile ended donating local hospital beginning since shorted (rural hospital issues guess).

I also face shields ready first week, 3d printed.

Man helpful even surgical masks.

I'll take trade day. No, don’t really care point. looks like 75% kids UK infected absolutely overwhelming majority completely fine. 

Everything realistically done done. average vaccinated person dies 85 years old 5 underlying health conditions. isn’t much tragedy me. unvaccinated people died younger, it’s sad it’s unnecessary unfortunately they’ve brought themselves. 

Now vaccines, boosters, honestly idea want. Covid cannot permanently elevated every aspect life. It’s stay we’ll get it. It’s even dangerous anymore basically everyone vaccinated. small risk remain great enough stop living life.   locations would go lived Contra Costa County. Perhaps attorney general’s orders Covid patients Montana receive large caulking tube full ivermectin ass. know, really large one holds two quarts. shit really works like “they” say does, ultimate litmus test. USA government invested 1.6 billion USD novel vaccine, FDA make exception consider EUA. Also, Flu+Covid vaccine make one kind. Flu already come back North America, looking Pandemic+Endemic combo. Also, Novavax means unwilling people become willing, also make sense expedite approval processes, evidence lower vaccination means variants, one wants/needs that.    contrary, vaccine induced immunity shown protective. sense reinfection common amongst experienced previous infection. agree you.   Congress

Party Congress nothing related major event, thousands people go Beijing, maybe another thousands reporters.   message wear mask protect others yourself. 

I’m sure old posts don’t remember message wonder much lessens risk. could hudge. Natural immunity shown better defense vaccine comes high risk yah know, catching disease. Bunch arrogant, entitled pussies. comply take fucking shot, fucking man children.  Exactly this. There's living there's covid living. lessens risk COVID general. Whether already immunity not. think about, seems like everything that's done increase division two parties makes easier people currently control, stay control. seem lot consensus among democrats republicans respect certain policy, currently serving office let happen. stay office division. result status quo remains largely untouched average american, tax cuts entitlements handed like candy rich. mean publically traded companies suppose mean ETFs retirement funds sure. I'm AZ got two Modernas February March wife surgery week doctor told get booster. asthma could wrote anything got booster. Nobody asking technically risk group since work retail go it. could not? So, administer stuff patient dies, would family rather sue, hospital state? rights stop rights exercised way cause harm others. Period. thats true. Global use dropped infrastructure logistics missing poor countries wealthy nations dont pay. Look vaccination rates poor countries, numbers abysmal due lack interest. shameful live wealthy country atm.  *clicks see it’s antidepressant That's probably big part union win lawsuit.

Nevertheless, union employees contract US Government, contract Southwest Airlines. 

Also, worth noting Southwest *have* subject *this* vaccine mandate. Southwest could give federal contract avoid mandate wanted to. Basically, Southwest making choice here. good obvious choice, yes, still choice. choice directly impacted union's members. Therefore, lawsuit.

Sorrento Therapeutics revealed phase 2 results COVID-19 drug candidate Abivertinib (oral capsule) treat patients severe covid-19 symptoms. Brazil USA phase 2 trials show 57% 34% improvement respectively avoiding death respiratory failure. Merck's drug treat mild moderate covid patients potentially great combo punch beat virus. Perhaps I’m reading something wrong looks like it’s comparing 577 days COVID 2019 deaths Heart disease, Cancer, etc. Shouldn’t extrapolated 577 days rather 365? COVID deaths annualized?  Well, no. According news release, Global Spending Usage Medicines report IQVIA Institute Human Data Science used invoice price levels calculate estimate. **The total cumulative spending COVID-19 vaccines 2025 expected hit $157 billion initial rounds vaccination expected completed 2022 biannual booster shots expected    Yup, lots people don’t understand scale involved 1.8 billion people, live small fraction landmass. unvaccinated people penalized risky behaviors get pass? That's cowards think. people care alone that's care about. one saying twice year. booster six months mean EVERY six months. That’s secondary immune responses work. one knows lomg protection last future hasn’t happened yet. airbag injected body. 

As I've said, support vaccines. I'm vaccinated wish everyone one was. think force people coerce people get medical procedures. Same. I've catching friends seen since pandemic started I've found talking single one vaccinated. really disappointing. people CARE anything short death. care never cared sick babies, sick mothers, mentally ill, elderly suffer can't pay medications, wounded soldiers, certainly care people debilitated COVID.

Hey leave drugs unprotected sex this! research! can't mine!  Third doses taking new dose twice year. Tons vaccines require 3-4 doses extreme effectiveness. Almost vaccines extreme long-lasting effectiveness one month worth doses. remains complete unknown whether regular boosters required, since third dose gives immunity far higher second they'd annual worst. guess next year small boosters included flu vaccines regardless. I'm championing cause here. I'm mearly pointing zero tolerance bullshit cop strategy politically convienant. People voice needlessly hurt solely political motivation.

Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Ok thank you. sounds reasonable me. thought idea numbers skewed hospitals order get funding although agree probably need would mean Covid isn’t big deal seems. I’m typically conspiracy guy though Don’t get close him, try eat love friend notice comment mentions boosters. important.  I'll explicit. R0 delta around 5.5. means would reach herd immunity (1-1/5.5)~82% population 100% immunity. Vaccines give 100% immunity, need vaccinate 82% population. much depends efficacy vaccine also factor decrease likelihood transmission vaccinated person becomes infection. Singapore, 85% vaccinated achieve desired goal. efficacy pfizer infection drops 50% 6 months. words, 85% Singaporeans vaccinated 50% efficacy, that's equivalent 42.5% population complete immunity. nearly enough. 

What saying certain vaccines (like pfizer moderna) give strong enough protection reach herd immunity 85-90% population vaccinated protection maintained via boosters. 

Again, something going achieve. methods, mentioned, necessary. Well yeah, general acronym exist? Seriously! Vaccinating children got rid polio *and* smallpox. Talk stupid choices. Let’s bring ‘em back!  hospital said whatever insurance pay, they'll take care rest. chronic smokers

That turned misinformation. higher risk frim covid. real. friend that's health inspector heard wild shit stuff co-workers found job. They're awesome people underappreciated. attitude get Thanksgiving Christmas cases still declining, vaccine widely available 5-11 age group, January 2022 end mask mandates remaining restrictions. it’s spreading widely winter months packed stadiums concerts everywhere, means we’re close herd immunity like Spring Delta hit. That's entirely true. N95 additional fit standards KN95 not. Filtration may effective, N95s lower allowable leakage rate threshholds KN95. virtually N95s two back head straps metal nose bands KN95 still certified ear loops nose bands good. 

If get KN95 ear loops, leakage rate going high. Get one multiple behind head straps probably good.

All said, recently boosted, going make much difference either way. mean, comment replied request sources ""antivaxx"" stuff thread Neil Cavuto getting threatened encouraging vaccine... responded article came months vaccine even available. exactly slam dunk part IMO. Time hospital sue state. can't force doctor give specific type medicine.   Yeah, people act like lives holy anything society, reality society agreed long time. example, lung cancer coal miners. Essentially two shitty doctors track record selling bullshit trying get rich falsifying data.

Unfortunately, police holds absolute power country, MD likely fearing life, sensible. Wtf Louisiana landlocked Arkansas coast!! looks it, expected, point think people legitimately watch Fox news completely uneducated, insane, psychopathic.

I tried watch understand arguments get past 2 minutes turn off. talking crime cities, essentially said areas voted democratic failing falling apart compared republican cities. mention facing unprecedented levels crime due policies police procedures, showed facts evidence back claim up. 

We know resist vaccine mandate, Fox news vaccine mandate U.S officially did. Fucking Hypocrites. immunosuppressed/immunocompromised saw news offered 4th doses vaccine early next year. going booster restore lost effectiveness ""4th shot"" due first three shots failing provide adequate protection par general population. Fought C19 299 days. fight medical bills rest eternity. studies early showing somewhat effective reducing hospitalizations. Larger studies since shown inconclusive results though. got J&amp;J April, got Moderna booster. seems like brainer, get protection mRNA levels. 

If public facing job mRNA vaccine, I’d also get booster. biggest benefit antibody levels going back high levels, main protection initial infection. B cells cells great you’ve already gotten infected, high Covid retail environment, I’d want antibodies too. 

The story might different plenty hospital capacity, point, anything prevent going hospital first place great. population per capita 1, 1 low number general, I'm sure agree.    [From referenced find  level  autonomy  adhere  NPIs  predict COVID- 19 infection alone,  rather risk infection diminished individuals wear face covering/masks (figure 3  online supplemental table s3). example, main effect model figure 3 model 1 online supplemental table s3 shows one higher score autonomy (ie, one condition  limited  respondents’ ability  comply  NPIs),   3% lower likelihood  testing positive SARS- CoV- 2 (OR 0.97; 95% CI 0.95  0.99).

On population scale, 3% lower likelihood testing positive meaningful. think anti-maskers find compelling. course, probably find science compelling guess there's that.   MD's small scope Healthcare workers...  know made comment aspirating needles. Please note right tell person injecting that. may huff puff disagree simply refuse injection time. still taught med school/ ursing school it’s practiced “painful” patient. think process aspiration look see blood come syringe man thanking someone could potentially miss case myocarditis also less effective shot.

I guess based concept Original Antigenic Sin. hypothesis gives immunological rationale behind preliminary study results showing people get flu covered annual vaccine, worse received vaccine year. Actually *negative flu vaccine effectiveness* groups--but could study artifact, course. 

But notable OAS argument used much context flu shots--nobody trying persuade people ""not jump gun,"" wait prudentially circulating strains identified, go get vaccinated. OAS may even completely wrong argument, would certainly counter-productive trying arrange degree collective immunity advance season. yet argument covid completely detached reasoning, I'm sure people would find monstrous trotted children care. Thank's trooper administer ivermectin? variant actually dodges natural vaccine immunity induced antibodies able bind spike proteins effectively.

I think Delta contagious variant dominant current methods immunity (natural vaccines) still effective it.  #WOW see two separate issues. There's refusing give necessary treatment due personal/religious beliefs, refusing arbitrarily prescribe medication unnecessary ineffective.

The Hippocratic oath this. Doctors swear use measures required benefit patient, respect hard-won scientific gains physicians them, act best judgement. US big, many levels government. example, San Francisco vaccination mandates patrons bars restaurants.

Now, US restrictions, compared countries, variations also go way :). example, live GA, always much cautious restrictions had. patient find new provider beliefs align get treatments appropriate that's okay. long state trying force individual doctors prescribe treatments think inappropriate whatever. far I'm concerned, provider prescribing treatments based evidence based practice that's them, patients, governing body grants license practice. weird this? Many countries approved boosters adults problem even requiring considered fully vaccinated. Maybe they’re trying appeal anti-vaxers use boosters talking point vaccines aren’t effective people aren’t changing minds, they’ll find excuse. What’s wrong saying “the original 2 doses work well 6 months, need booster”? Down-N-Out burger? “To protect serve.”
Seems like right choice.

The anti-vaxx movement US largely maintained people vulnerable. US's vaccination rate may lowering cases due vaccinating high mobility persons, actually increasing case fatality rate, due high risk individuals making large percentage people vaccinated.  
In words, case US greater chance happening unvaccinated vulnerable person case another country would.  definitely end mask mandates restriction. 

First, vaccine mandates go away (and many local issues schools start mandating it). 

Second, given uncertainty (will new variant?) local variations (Colorado's cases increasing right now, example), probably appropriate end \*all\* restrictions whole USA, much less world.

Third, there's bureaucratic inertia, politics, many different local authorities. Even clear eliminate, say, mask mandates Podunk Township, need council meeting, meet every 3 months ... mayor election pushing COVID restrictions, may take longer, politically, get there.

Fourth, lot restrictions government mandated, private companies. work retail, probably keep mask, since shows company 'cares' clients. venues may still (officially) require masks insurance reasons, etc

Russia downplayed pandemic beginning. ""Everything control""-mentality. E.g.[reuters days/weeks later setting new records. June Putin boasted Russia ""the situation better compared many countries,” [Washington Post Economic Forum Saint Weeks later Russia set time record daily deaths, wave continues today. 


Russia downplayed daily deaths new cases pandemic. Last year reported 56k Covid deaths, 362k excess deaths. [New York Russia still underreport deaths. Yes, US western countries undercount too, close undercount Russia. countries maybe got ration excess death vs reported covid death 1.1-1.2 Russia got 4. E.g. [The 


US said 100 million vaccine doses 100 days, outcome 200 million doses 100 days. Russia said 60% fully vaccinated September, outcome 33% fully vaccinated. (And many got e.g. EpiVac Sputnik light bought vaccine cert?) 


Russia still cannot get Sputnik V approved EU, still failing provide data documents.

In Russia downplaying pandemic, giving mixed messaged, spreading anti-vaxx propaganda general mistrusting government gives result 33% fully vaccinated, daily new records new lockdowns.

While US seeing end pandemic, Russia going new lockdown setting new records daily deaths new cases. still increasing. COVID-19 patients swap hospitals.

Would help stayed put bit? parts US extremely obese, combined poor healthcare (Bible Belt specifically). shut dining room drive thru only. win-win, stay open without checking cards government get pissed. live near one. incredible drive-through lines day every day. going hurt pocketbook big time. polls regarding covid recently misleading. Remember like half unvaccinated hospital workers something said they'd quit instead get vaccinated? happen. sucks hearing cases going states seem still high. Another Covid winter us guess.   Exactly. drive thru line long go go inside line long usually pass.   Trust science plummeting? Got source? season matter?  stat accurate Florida? anyone know what’s causing increase? Delta Plus variant? think Germany highly vaccinated country, right? long lines drive thru, go inside nearly empty. Allow explain spike states ""in west"" article put it.

States like New Mexico led nation vaccination efforts early on. New Mexico also one highest vaccinated populations country. Currently 72.3% fully vaccinated 18+, 81.9% least 1 shot adolescents 54.2% fully vaccinated 62.4% least 1 shot. Yet last 7 weeks. New Mexico seen steady increase cases creating hot spot see map.

On surface would ask ""why numbers going way vaccinated 16 people per square mile population?

&amp;#x200B;

First in, first out. That's why. know immunity provided mRNA vaccines starts wane 6 months. New Mexico seeing states around got vaccination efforts running later. 

&amp;#x200B;

So hot spots, like New Mexico. literally window everyone else's future. states around start hit 6 months post vaccination mark immunity starts wane, see cases go well. matter situations actual vaccinated percentage state looks like does, population density given increased infectiousness delta (and delta+ sequenced United States).

If get booster, get booster soon can. get vaccinated havent. Get vaccinated. Stop this- ""saidhey left job due vaccine mandate""

Yeah guess international travel countries big one missing. trip NZ cut short March 2020 we’re sure we’re gonna able go back (and normal trip). 

I don’t think agree masks though. summer, cases way down, happy wearing anymore. Delta came around seemed infecting vaccinated people, 40% country still refusing get vaccinated anyway, made sense put back on. 

I much prefer indoor mask mandate things getting canceled closing again. cases trending think we’re headed back towards mandate. imagine future masks 95% time, localized mask mandates outbreaks happen, I’m fine means lockdowns. Prescribing ivermectin doctor patient's wishes?

Or alternatively, could chill out. Rationally understand covid-19 turning endemic means *someday* infected it. vaccinated at-risk population, odds suffering milder symptoms overwhelmingly favor, likely accept several much higher risks health life everyday without thought.

If at-risk population, sure consider booster, understand offers temporary increase *resistance infection*. 
I know sounds like nonchalantly condemning part population severe illness death, what's counterproposal minimize risk? Life sterile isolation human beings forever? risk populations *at-risk* covid-19. vaccines everyone's odds better.

Sadly Larimer County cases keep climbing 50% people stores masking. knew Mesa County hotspot earlier year checked lately. moved 9 yrs ago crazy open.  Nah. plenty blame you’re referring incident article, incorrect.    humbly stand corrected coming place using 'most' misleading someone reading assume Israel 80-90% vaccinated. 

It's important clarify Israel mid 60 percentile double vaxxed 12+ population re-flare Delta longer good case study compared highest double vaxxed population much earlier year Alpha lot developed countries surpassed them. 

Maybe me, hear word imagine higher number wanted make sure clarify point :) Source? I've seen people say this, never provide source pressed really alive though? Would want live like that?  That's every metric plummeting weeks. I'm hoping go back this. place I'm really concerned schools. Nearly everyone else ignoring mask mandate anyway 🙄 ....that's time government use fucking power make people get vaccinated. Instead keep playing democracy.

Right now, Putin tries indirect pressure, like fining companies workforce vaccination rate X%.

You saying government pressure people directly. flexing muscle way always risky government. happens nobody cares?

The vast majority Russians know government corrupt. care long bread circuses - long government keeps lives. Mandating vaccine nobody wants might cross red line.

Putin easily deal environmentalist human rights activists, there's them. given inefficient inept Russian administration outside major cities, might able enforce vaccine mandate widespread resistance. danger lies autocratic regime: happens people realise powerful claim be? Vaccines haven’t stopped working. higher percentage population vaccinated, you’re inevitably going breakthrough cases. 

I’d blame people either vaccinated wearing masks, vaccines definitely working well. 

Boosters essential keeping numbers down, though. probably hoped would happen. Early inheritance good inheritance. /Sad. Chickenpox ""immunity"" *can* last life, chickenpox virus also re-appear shingles 70. virus never actually leaves caused varicella-zoster virus — virus causes chickenpox. chickenpox, virus lies inactive nerve tissue near spinal cord brain.

Thankfully, there's shingles vaccine now. impression get people *think* they're lying actually lying criteria incredibly broad portrayed media narrow.  President Vladimir Putin's government pinning hopes homegrown vaccines like Sputnik V jab, Russians proven stubbornly resistant inoculated.

I like CCP, due China concentrating population cities, can't really afford let run rampant. Plus China social welfare net all.

Still quite right. FDA approves Emergency Use Authorization.

The CDC approves rollout usage item (in case, vaccine) approved emergency use.

Its sort like this: FDA approves item safe effective use specific populations, monitors ongoing manufacturing, etc said item.

The CDC decides among ""approved populations"" actually gets access said item, ORDER - normally, non-EUA vaccines, would become part called ""recommended vaccination schedule"" - bit different EUA status vaccines, since temporary recommendation/approval distribution.

Once vaccine FULLY licensed FDA, typically added ""recommended vaccination schedule""

But ""Emergency Use Authorization"" term applies specifically FDA approval process. people think ok go hospital demand treated medications prescribed physician actively involved hospital care?

Trumpmath  bye donald trump part past government, recall. deserves blame. glorious leaders, infinite wisdom decided perfect time drop mask mandate schools. group people unvaccinated other. smh.

I mean, good vaccination rate? great compared many european partners. course could compare east europe, bad practise look countries highest incidence globally. According calculations RKI, international science behind it, vaccination rate high enough sole factor stop heavy burden hospitals deaths. vaccination rate 85% needed achievable, basis mathematical models presented results surveys vaccination acceptance, consider target vaccination rate (vaccination protection full vaccination) 85% 12–59 year olds 90% people aged 60 necessary also achievable. vaccination quota reached time, pronounced 4th wave coming autumn / winter seems unlikely, provided population continues adhere basic hygiene measures addition vaccination and, number infections increases again, reduces contacts certain extent. mean? still need nonpharmacuetical measures like masks, distancing, frequent air filter.

Now, let finish anecdote: Rode train week, mask mandate effect. one stop found 10 people train thought perfect time eat train. hospital doctor walked around rooms without mask, isnt allowed to. saw wore mask put ask would recognize him...like wtf..how important? TLDR, people spend time indoors dont follow mandates pretty much anymore, low vaccination rate. early preliminary successes fraudulent.          much worse results per capita compared California lucky spared initial wave last year hit tri-state area hard else would worse NY well per capita. lot people really understand mean want get rid COVID, even though several countries currently offering good examples live well virus. reality that, even strict mitigation, virus still spread extent.

BACKGROUND 
Coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) disproportionately results hospitalization death older patients underlying conditions. Sotrovimab pan-sarbecovirus monoclonal antibody designed prevent progression Covid-19 high-risk patients early course disease. 
 
METHODS 
In ongoing, multicenter, double-blind, phase 3 trial, randomly assigned, 1:1 ratio, nonhospitalized patients symptomatic Covid-19 (≤5 days onset symptoms) least one risk factor disease progression receive single infusion sotrovimab dose 500 mg placebo. primary efficacy outcome hospitalization (for hours) cause death within 29 days randomization. 
 
RESULTS 
In prespecified interim analysis, included intention-to-treat population 583 patients (291 sotrovimab group 292 placebo group), 3 patients (1%) sotrovimab group, compared 21 patients (7%) placebo group, disease progression leading hospitalization death (relative risk reduction, 85%; 97.24% confidence interval, 44 96; P=0.002). placebo group, 5 patients admitted intensive care unit, including 1 died day 29. Safety assessed 868 patients (430 sotrovimab group 438 placebo group). Adverse events reported 17% patients sotrovimab group 19% placebo group; serious adverse events less common sotrovimab placebo (in 2% 6% patients, respectively). 
 
CONCLUSIONS 
Among high-risk patients mild-to-moderate Covid-19, sotrovimab reduced risk disease progression. safety signals identified.

Tiger vacc FTW! Anyone ive lost Covid AZ. Unfortunately, it’s people. Well look bright side: new standards intelligent. think Vienna funeral museum. Might interesting trade fair. Make vaccines available (such providing free at-home at-work vaccination make programs well known limited 9am-5pm), provide guaranteed PTO even contractors/gig workers get vaccinated, provide large amounts money people vaccinated, vaccine passports, improve public messaging effectiveness vaccines, allow teens get vaccinated without parental approval (providing vaccines places schools). There's lots viable options involve forcing people get vaccinated. I've seen almost one supports forcing people get vaccinated.

There course holdouts, there's lot people still reached begrudgingly get vaccine able go back brunch, avoid fired, get money. think less 10% population US whole would outright refuse reasonable policies. Getting 80%+ fully vaccinated would make huge difference, there's reason give 100%. What’s percentage? I’m really grateful excellent mrna vaccines. imagine virus happened early 1900s guess speaking chronically depressed/anxious. instance, I've meds since 10 years... 29.  Got booster yesterday. sore arm, achy joints, headache fatigue. also got flu shot along it, might feel little bit worse second dose. 

I wish best recovery! got booster last week. depression, anxiety, epilepsy. One I'd fill bingo card. ever concerned people's ability infect others seasonal flu? rate though. Never rate. OK, decision. Honestly affect me. I'm thrilled vaccinated. got within days eligibility. I'm got job related booster well.

I well aware 1905 supreme court decision. sure agree it, law. agree. Taking Facebook great everyone except Facebook executives. employees realize eventually better working actual evil entity. Wait what? another surge? Wait get sick? Like exactly tomorrow? good idea get booster. otherwise stated, there's reason get booster, many reasons getting booster could bad idea. think may replied wrong comment here. problem population clearly headed way COVID hit gas pedal NSFA  borders control, pressure vaccinate full speed. countries needed vaccine urgently hence got preferential treatment manufacturers. husband’s family lives there. parents family vaccinated, sister, baby, hadn’t gotten doctor told it’s safe she’s longer breastfeeding. She’s waiting cleared OB get it. crazy, fertility doctor Connecticut, live, told get soon available found pregnant. health system great, say least. Lying bad look. might stalled saying looking whether public needed them, almost anything, lying made look untrustworthy. fact cheap reason somehow become demonized. new drug costs lot, essentially cheap drug rapidly developed pushed kind miracle cure. think reasonable expect uptake similar (perhaps little less) 12-17 group. Simply judging uptake 12-17 compared 18-49. that's like saying he's warmest ice-cube; he's still piece shit. internet general issues positivity. hip smarter rest spin something doom laden snark fest. I'd hate imagine real life happy event.

Neither, really doubt Ireland hunger medicine shortages nightclubs closed little longer. Hallelujah! Better here. It’s like that, it’s exactly that. Ignorant, petulant, obstinant, rebellious people are, making decisions leads screaming unvaccinated discriminated against. policies set private businesses requiring vaccination fly, attend events, etc.

I personally care whether particular person decides get vaccinated not. think rest society right exclude people privileges services it, including critical services. That's ethical questions incendiary disagreements come in. kidding think even death impacts people. They'll watch kindred defiant loved ones die STILL use facebook death posts platform push anti-vaxx, anti-hospital pro Ivermectin agendas. 

It's absolutely bonkers. people insane consider legitimate threat point. Covid would recommend get booster instead. Famotadine, levocitirizine, (I start 1 week prior) crap ton Benadryl epi ready along intramuscular dephenhydramine case.

Have guys tried using spoonful sugar? No, minimum 6 months 2nd dose. hard justify explanation. Regulatory agencies considering benefit reducing transmission serious way. They're looking individual risk versus benefit. 

The UK simple example. chose vaccinate healthy 12-17s 1/90,000 risk death 1/10,000 risk myocarditis second dose; 5% chance catching covid means individual benefits marginal. AFAICT never considered giving first doses. Since decision far 5% 12-17s caught covid delta wave, 1/5,000 country (mostly over-60s) died it. Politics aside reminds fundamentally bad humans (myself included) understanding probability especially small numbers. 

0.2% sounds small, 1 500 sounds huge. Even someone knows two values equivalent brain still processes reacts differently.

US-centric question, still restrictions mask mandates? I’ve going restaurants, gym, packed music venues months now. I’m state indoor mask mandate can’t think anything I’m *not allowed* currently. It’s little annoying wearing mask time also makes feel safer crowds. 

I’m sure that’s case countries without much vaccine supply though. Pure “emotions”. I’m even sure realize it. you’ve ever engaged absolutely impossible make change mind. I’ve friendly conversations won’t get vaxxed absolutely nothing change mind…until get it. 

Example. cousin. Said didn’t need since already virus. said would super safe got vaccine. Wouldn’t listen. week later talked hospital Covid. Stayed 14 days. admit wrong. that’s day late dollar short. Yes, pisses took valuable resources. nothing, mean nothing, could made get shot - short mandated. he’s wealthy doesn’t work work mandate wouldn’t work.

I think restrictions un vaccinated implemented. Want fly? Need vaccinated. Want see movie? Need vaccinated. Redoubt movement... Sounds like clickbait. vaccines public school California late 90s/early 2000s.

They added new vaccine requirement set everyone could get school. It’s definitely happened before.  I’ve heard Dr. Daniel Griffin discuss TWiV. Thanks.  vaccines *why* number going down.    forget also find quack doctor willing prescribe ivermectin::

1. Without met even spoken patient
2. Without patients medical records
3. Likely spending minutes ""patients"" guys prescribing crapload people call them
4. Prescribing money (and advertising fact somewhere online, possibly word mouth still somehow reaching desired audience
5. putting medical license/prescribing authority risk prescribe treatments know work potentially dangerous.

""Need ivermectin? quack doctors prescribe unconscious antivaxx brother little 15 minutes, money back!""
4.  Probably. Excited see Dutton's season 4. No, Greek  Exactly. Bye, Feleicia. I've read kinds things, like got COVID delta antibodies, better nothing, really prevent getting delta. 6 months infection natural immunity may wane leaving less protected. Previously infected people get vax really robust immune response basically super charged it. 

So already COVID unvaxxed slightly less likely get vs unvaxxed person never covid. likely get covid vaccinated person.

The best thing get vaccinated. Joke realize get vaxxed get another job. Dude entire state completely insane. county best we're still can. 4th biggest state one lowest populations. county that's size Rhode Island maybe 1000 people it. areas sparse, independent (and really lived right?), well educated. us areas given access education tend fare much better common sense human decency.

right, ship sailed long ago regards Vaccine^(TM) saving entire world society (or USA) Covid19 ... endemic everywhere.  COVID elimination ideologies fairy tales onset. Seems like need get Plan B,C, &amp; now...

To this, would happen is:

2-AND vaccine would applied entire population (world, say individual 100%-locked-down-isolated-country) population one fell swoop (never could happen logistically).

3-AND virus variants arising time frame.

So would think 1.5% 2% range crunched numbers. Probably closer could maybe link actual part discuss you’re talking Republicans adamant decades right healthcare?  Remember restaurants putting (often voluntarily) nutritional calorie info menus people started screaming making feel ""guilty"" pressured making healthier decisions?

None happened surprise.  You’ve made mistake calling logic. No, contrary feel consequence healthcare advertised shopping outlet. many times seen commercials end ""talk doctor starting X medication""?

If US &lt;20k cases daily, spikes case numbers, limited restrictions, high levels social contact, else would take ended restrictions?  It’s probably blip, least indoor holiday gatherings starting next month. we’ll see climb. least, that’s nurses live say.  went Alligator food festival Montana benefit police association shit not, every cop sporting clover tattoos several SS tattoos. Yes sarcasm. It’s probably huge increase, don’t think we’ll really see cases start climbing November people start going home visiting families holidays. Weed weirdos' totally depends restaurant. look photo vaccine card don’t bother match name ID.   Kanye  get shot every 6 months. Bad working. “This _decline_ + vaccines”would better. I’m really confused, I’m sorry sarcasm? We’re close anymore. wish info share, know researchers evaluated infectious spread rate covid, found COVID-19 US much earlier initially projected around time lockdown.

Odds are, without mask mandates many people got sick COVID-19 way verify actually COVID-19 early stages pandemic lockdown.

Anecdotally, February 14th, 2020... thought going die. feeling sick hell breathe well. took upon wear mask early stay away people much could. went doctor, told upper respiratory infection, COVID-19 test all. asked symptoms gave medicine based that.

I'm sure many people got antibodies COVID-19 already. However, important understand virus still mutate too. still important get vaccinated. takes coronavirus enough mutation order targetable mRNA vaccine. scientists careful track new strains COVID-19. newer strains higher infectiousness vulnerable current vaccines, would send whole world lockdown again. That's understanding reading study. partially vaccinated fully vaccinated, hazard ratios long COVID specifically close 1 (1 within confidence interval). fact, hazard ratio partially vaccinated slightly lower long COVID. See appendix plot showing this. 

The authors include this: negative findings might indicate

Im erring side caution either way  They've ""naturally vaccinated"". :) like &lt;1%... might well round 80% vaccinated right now, 20% unvaxxed presumably, 5% group would 1% total population. Probably less remove non-workers, basically anyone school older 60.    doctor declining give birth control *Medical* reasons, purely patients interests?

Is doctor declining give ivermectin *medical* reasons, purely patent's interests?

There reason doctors gate keepers medication. Real person land. know, moron. Also free loader apparently. Don’t feed troll. anyone else see prequel come?

I honestly see becoming norm.

The last time something similar happened, Utah, state got [$500,000 officer involved shown door. incident actually created new say keep happening, say shitty. least checks place though. look like also dangerous older vaccines (see pause use)

This nonsense. 3 deaths linked J&amp;J vaccine 15 million+ doses administered. That's basically negligible, actually lower risk death childhood MMR vaccines. pause bureaucratic mRNA shot's effectiveness wane rapidly

This qualitative statement. appears wane, seen data would indicate ""rapidly"" applies here. apparent reduction efficacy may caused prevalence Delta rather immunity easy demonize ""other"" side, prefer focus humanity try understand hesitancy comes from.

Their hesitancy comes misinformation, seem interested spreading. part problem, we're trying part solution. juvenile suggest choice without unknown risk.

No, not. Believing subjecting increased risk vaccination actually what's juvenile. Risk inaction needs considered along risk action, is, always been, *far uncertainty* inaction case action.  Literally every parent know champing bit get kid vaccinated. means normalizing higher death rates lower life expectancies. still long COVID. learning happens multiple infections person. Probably false positive rapid antigen test. Stop resisting... except it’s not. it’s 5% smaller subset people. basically many all.  forgotten prophesied Easter Miracle? Probably covid cases 20% recently. Smaller vector extremely vulnerable. killed Americans every military conflict we've ever in, surpassed Spanish Flu number Americans killed it. 

Why numbers matter less ""death rate"" also failed define? Bleach kill covid petrie dish, drink water laced small amount bleach safely (it's ideal, valid method disinfecting water emergency). However bleach water drink neither strong enough kill covid, able directly interact virus via digestive tract. 

There probably hundreds substances kill covid petrie dish, would either kill human sufficient concentrations, interact virus human body way lab. hard understand explain, even moron. crazy collective scientific illiteracy extreme something like understood huge subset population. Table 2 pages 25-26. laymen's terms, things are... improving. Especially compared numbers time last year, considering like year distributing vaccines. say entirely impossible, though current theories LC (that involve immunity inflammation) respond less devastingly immune systems primed vaccine.  Sometimes reporting delays. could beginning another surge, can't know sure. I'd wait see weeklong trend deciding cases increasing again.

Though wish first comments ""good news"" US article trying downplay good news. Delta keeps upping transmission rates keep lowering protocols.

Vaccines work, get yours. also need added protocols mitigate spread. see mandated FDA panel discussion. Nope, well known, day employee german gas station shot asked customer wear mask. example.  Hi /r/Coronavirus. recently published article, thought would enjoy it. believe accessible everyone, please let know cannot access it. abstract below:​

Popular press articles asserted certain political orientations less likely wear face masks COVID-19 pandemic. propose relation due differential information shared political parties rather values associated face mask wearing. propose that, assessed together, political party affiliation (e.g., Republican, Democrat) political ideology (e.g., conservative, liberal) predicts face mask wearing, effect mediated perceptions efficacy doubts perceptions face masks infringe upon wearer's independence. performed three-wave, time-separated survey study 226 participants. proposal supported. assessed together, political party affiliation political ideology significantly predicted face mask wearing, significant indirect effect observed via perceptions efficacy doubts independence. results support face mask wearing unique preventative action, understood using political theory.   love casually admit complete piece shit would intentionally fuck people like big deal.

Now Culver's... Best fast food chain opinion.    vaccinated March received second Moderna shot.

Oh sorry, mean someone whose predictions actually taken seriously? got nothing. Honestly kind like idea food service workers wearing masks even pandemic. Yes, 50 micrograms it’s still Pfizer booster 30 micrograms. 

The NIH preliminary study mixing boosters showed moderna effective booster overall.  It’s wild, LA county literally 4 weeks without mask mandate since beginning - ended june returned July.

[Vaccine FAQ Part FAQ Part appointment bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Sweet Honestly good point. haven’t looked data spread vaccine, potentially that’s true. Anecdotally last wave “pandemic unvaccinated” least hospitalizations, vaccines people “natural” immunity may least make worse flu. AFAIK, Hawaii restrictions restaurant capacity, that's it. Every state 100% open comes capacity limits wish, no.

95% currently unvaccinated workers EITHER get vaccine required get it. think understand other. First ""COVID season"" like flu. We've 4 waves span 18 months. 

Secondly took total number cases 577 days averaged (cases per day) gave estimate many deaths span 365 days.

Thirdly everyone went hospital COVID got tested it. know people died COVID since tested positive virus, one flu variants. flu essentially non existant due contagiousness COVID. like delta 99.9% cases compared fraction spring Alpha variants majority. think pollsters account data analysis. vaccines scarce working mass vaccine site got first dose said would get one else could night happened since vial one left used.

Second dose got Q.

Booster got soon could beat future mandates one wants work /s Hahaha that’s funny. Love it! know downvoted. trial size *was* incredibly small reading documentation myocarditis basically founded assumption. I'm sure I'd jump get young kid shot either. coming fourteen year old who's vaccinated. Unless get surge people vaccinated past 8-12 months ending ERs probably see booster mandate   city announced they’re ending mask mandates cutting back vaccine requirements Friday… immediately weekend’s tourist-swarmed Halloween festivities. Like “Oh precautions effective! Let’s call day stop now.”  way, yes.  like getting yearly flu shot. vaccines non-sterilizing people vaccinated still get asymptomatic infections spread, basically untrue? Ending spikes require people can't spread it, seems pretty far distance.

It would interesting try work date which, assuming vaccination rates improve, 95% population either vaccinated sub-six-months since natural infection 99% (which much harder).

(just reference: team pro-vaccination) dream living in? join? Ahhhh. Thanks. would lockdowns? choice masks vs normal life, masks vs lockdowns.

Hospitals longer risk highly vaccinated areas like LA. lockdown days behind us.

Masks necessary mean stick around forever. really need PSAs downsides masks. lot people seem know bad elderly. exactly he's doing? must mistaken someone else, said thing. like all.

Master tactician; lousy strategist. CDC ACIP draft agenda November 2-3 meeting.  2nd reserved COVID vaccines, vaccines 3rd (Hepatitis, Orthopoxvirus, Ebola), expect ACIP vote 2nd Pfizer vaccine 5-12 CDC action shortly Logistics list. shameful getting first doses every country. counting days stupid antivax cubicle neighbor gets thrown ass. hear conspiracy theorist bullshit. think caught bad time (Friday night close) person administered booster flat asked “Why need booster?” taken aback said “I’m at-risk group” (which true) enough him.

Edit: CVS. True troll antibody response unlucky people. work company encourages kind thing Neil. thrives anger hatred anything everything, using propaganda generate it. Either get program toe line scientific stuff (meaning, oppose it) reap company sown. drank bleach back then, would now. think there's anything funny western ignorant.

Eastern Europe USSR one prolific rises literacy throughout history. requirement citizens (who mentally capable) literate, illiteracy still factor U.S.

Why westerners love spreading propaganda? I've lived went school Canada Eastern Europe assure I'd rather get Eastern European education. correct though. average IQ gone sure. little surprised Singapore government trying convince people get vaccinated. would think would tell people get vaccinated would start making lives extremely difficult. example, taking housing away firing government jobs mandating private companies mandate employees get vaccinated. hard numbers equate 3 shots immunocompromised = 2 shots everyone else? studies I've seen suggest 3rd dose helps boost antibodies half vulnerable population 3 shots immunocompromised = antibody levels 2 shots normal people immunocompromised still large disadvantage.

The reason grudgingly getting it? go daughter's destination wedding Central America


Nobody changing mind unless compelled via job requirement, school requirement, travel requirement wonder areas improved underreporting cases. What? OP make ""abrupt ending"" prediction. January 2022 end mask mandates remaining restrictions

Most everyone understands covid forever, least long longer. people marking ""the end"" typically begin treating covid like common viruses, like flu. restriction, yearly vaccines, seasonal caution, etc. said comment vaccine doesn’t work. it?   guy, I’m sure leaving clears work place political rambling bit.  empathy, solution came along small percentage population decided take majority hostage part solution. recall one saying healthy fit. rest don’t remember. stood comments remembered it. Tons kids never tested last year, though, fair  add algorithmic social media, poisonous talk radio certain hyper partisan ""news"" channel baby, got toxic stew goin Moderna half-dose still pretty potent. don’t think it’s gonna make real world difference. Still putting restrictions stadiums full public places open. European countries UK bring another big wave covid world. Yes, joke. literally prescription drugs counter drugs. Surely already agreed? Lol, Auxiliary Police.   Thanks to, Joe Biden weak point reporting population statistics.  Different sites use different estimates population sometimes shows different percentages.

The absolute number people vaccinated counted.  errors (like counting 2nd dose someone else's 1st dose -- going get worse boosters), going throw number much.

But lot harder accurate count many people live particular area.  find anomalies like towns vaccination rate. mostly delta right though: Northeast vaccination rates pretty high, immunity infection waning, immunity severe outcomes still strong. talking surges without significant hospitalizations/deaths, virus essentially endemic. said, long covid problematic some, people get booster continue wearing masks finally get state controlled surges that, cases overwhelm healthcare system.  


Unfortunately regions lower vaccinations low mask usage south, can't assume same, know many actually caught virus obtained natural immunity, unlike vaccinations counted. larger surges due unvaccinated &amp; uninfected population, large hospitalizations still possibility  Agreed. Fool once, shame you. Fool me—you can't get fooled again. Fully vaccinated vaccines terribly ineffective, wonder still need COVID Zero policies. RTFA sounds aggressive sort meme. doubt meant aggressive. could wrong. love bravado survey compared actually money line.

“1/3 unvaccinated workers say resign rather comply new mandate.”

5% actually go it. r/confidentlyincorrect weed prescription years, never allowed blaze hospital!!  Eh, worse part saw data Brazil apparently lax manufacturing controls inactivated viral vector growing crappy cell allowed work? restriction?   sure that's really even something concerned about?

Yes, children hospitalizations, sure risk really even significant, possible statistically higher risk posed child swimming pools? Let alone cars.

Secondly, child goes public school, certain even already infected? test showed symptoms all?

I get it. look 1 article may make think quarantine child society immediately. another article indicates would wildly overreacting.

I know position based I've read, can't tell decide trustworthy.

You might consider Covid mega thread r/epidemiology try get expert advice though. depressing back May became apparent 1/3 population believe reality react violently confronted delusions. Absolutely. I’m happy texas approach pre vaccine, culture shock since haven’t left mainland since pre pandemic.   one shrugging obesity, yes dealt covid subreddit neighbor fat won’t kill make sick. might. Apples oranges. Texas 3x death rate. Current numbers going reflect that.

Of course NPI's need exit strategy. Hopefully exit strategy 5-11 vaccination third doses general population, ""just catching Texas later"". Kinda spamming like James Heathers super fresh:  That's told staff, resisting! Thanks. guess management safety oriented particular location. Although TX vaccine requirements aren’t strict it’s entirely comparable SF situation. could cramped open meat market course virus managed transmission bat carcass anything else, life uhhhh finds way.

The point open air meat markets clearly outlived usefulness. Pull head ass. go? Saying still get infected vaccine overlooks fact vaccine tremendously slows spread. largely protective, people catch less infectious recover faster. large percent community vaccinated, factors add major drop spread. That's still seeing drop even though millions people getting together large groups living normal lives.  think there’s certain momentum happens people (“people around me”) start actually getting it. Like, time last year, weirded idea “rushed” vaccine (possibly pushed negligence Trump appointees? concerns vague untrue, IMO entirely unfounded) didn’t imagine I’d want first wave. reality, seeing lots people know get earlier access vaccine - nurses, teachers, doctors, etc - realizing people people consider reasonably intelligent, looked Covid vaccine got developed fast like 10 seconds even understood better. time turn came around signed first day eligible. 

I think visibility choice important. I’m far-left progressive considers pretty decently intelligent, raised still living heavily blue area - anti-mask “faith fear” reactionary, *I* fence shoved pre-emptive hesitancy sheer volume “reasonable people” knew getting shot moment could. Facebook photos people “vaccinated” stickers, vaccine-day outfits, etc - felt like sea every time opened feed, knew people stupid crazy, started question feelings examine actually rooted (spoiler: science). So, 7-year old gets shot, tell world it. Likewise, speak shot though assume everyone jump moment can. use positive apolitical language topic comes up. rude aggressive, like, encounter someone vaccine, I’d politely baffled.

My fervent hope “all kid’s friends” shot, feel ridiculous remain “hesitant.” actually hesitant, least. anti-vaccine hiding behind excuse hesitancy, nothing short school/business mandates potentially sway don’t concern trying change minds. I’ll glad it’s finally kids can’t go fun places fun things, I’m sick kids ones stay home. think mirror parents all.

In uneducated, layman opinion, probably significant number vaccinated parents say ""I'm willing take risk vaccine personally, subject child disease susceptible to.""  parent would wrong, see lot think way.

I'm open possibility, would actually elated, I'm wrong though. Aerosolizing interventions really thing. is, they're distinct thing. Covid patients aerosolizing lying breathing talking. think precautions taken aerosolizing interventions, apply time patient testing positive. Obesity US highest among Blacks, American Indians, Hispanics, order, Whites intense respiratory syndrome"".

Covid, energy drink. extreme! electrolytes! Intense! Obesity contributes Pandemic deaths, especially US---Blacks, American Indians, Hispanics higher rates Obesity Whites N franchise locations. Zero sympathy pro-diseasers. Globally absolutely enough vaccines. According enough currently-approved dose production 2 doses *most* world's population (1.5+ doses per capita) end year, another ~1 dose per capita potentially currently-unapproved vaccines (wouldn't count it). Something like half inactivated, one quarter vectored, &lt;1 quarter mRNA. 1.6 billion doses month. plenty doses.

But weekly dose usage plummeted last months, even manufacturing capacity continues rise. getting ready throw away doses? doses used reported? actually stopped manufacturing production plants sit idle? China giving everyone another dose reported yet? COVID isn’t problem county, significantly less threat average American compared complications obesity. COVID wouldn’t nearly deadly US wasn’t rampant obesity. reason case fatality rate much higher every country. insane shrug obesity like nothing reality single largest strain medical system. really wanted less people die get sick, would something it.    probably hundreds substances kill covid petrie dish, would either kill human sufficient concentrations,

Lead. handgun, per xkcd. Yep states still mask mandates otherwise there’s real restrictions like last year.  Great! Less drama queens say that? scientific fact. 

The FDA says clinical trials assessing ivermectin tablets prevention treatment COVID-19 people ongoing. Personally, kind dealbreaker paper surfaced saying data Gamaleya institute provided Lancet was, say, statistically inconsistent. ready take subpar vaccine with, say, 50% efficiency - numbers confirmed trustworthy research. outright terrifying take something state lying face about. OK fair enough. also human dewormer. studies claimed effective COVID. specific studies turned fraudulent. in, made imaginary patients level  grew shithole state. things never change. J&amp;J made mouth taste funny (Like sucking something bitter) 2 weeks. Moderna booster made arm joints hurt little 12 hours day shot. arm felt fine 24 hours rolled around, hurt like muscle knot shot location places ligament damage ached little bit. That's I'm day 3 now.  anyways. don’t something government told to, you’re essentially allowing government tell it. Either way government controlling you. Maybe try galaxy braining one. least may confuse long enough allow make clean getaway. stupid GOP Attorney General’s head buried Trump’s ass. neighbor whose grandson spent five weeks ventilator rsv. people awareness rsv serious young children. recent announcement rsv vaccine fast tracked welcome news. It’s older people, 65 factor. KIDS vaccines yet. worldmeter (don't know accurate)

Like 0% accurate. accurate public reported numbers, may retroactively fixed everything.

USA 1.2 million excess deaths(140k accounted via overdose accidental death increases) deaths roughly 1 million.

Russia death toll minimum 3 times higher(They admitted that) roughly 700k 250k.

India reporting 450k dead covid.

The Delta wave India 5 million excess deaths. Yes. 5 million. 3.4 - 4.4 million attributed Covid. India 4 million deaths SINGLE WAVE. Overall Indias numbers 10-12x higher official numbers.

Every single country underreported, rich country accurate numbers general still undercounted. Country like US seems get lot cases, reporting 1.5k deaths another country reporting 1.5k deaths hitting country mysteriously worse usa shows 100k say russia shows 30k cases. Certain countries hit capacity specific point test people.

For US number 300k daily cases, India, somewhere like Russia fraction, poorer countries even worse especially early on. Countries helping others testing etc.

The official death toll Covid-19 roughly 5 million.

Taking KNOW need stress KNOW guessing, minimum death toll covid exceed 10 million world wide looking top 10 countries. Covid closer 10-15 million worse wide point.

Covid 0.6% death rate would mean IIRC 48 million would die. OG Covid 0.6 believe, Alpha 0.8% believe Delta showing 150-230% worse OG Covid roughly 1.2-1.5% mortality. 

Covid potential kill minimum 48 million globally(not counting long covid etc) Delta kill 100 million globally.

So 10-15 million may sound scary ""Way higher expect"" really... 48 million would died first wave countries yet ""Wash over"" them. collective work stretched death point time vaccines started 6-8 million died, delta 10-15 million deaths massive vaccination drive continue die.

Perhaps covid include countries deaths pandemic ""Officially"" end 20 million deaths.

48 million OG Covid, 140 million Delta. collective work saved potentially 28 million 100 million people.

We happy this. tell that? dunno Papua New Guinea. deaths massively underreported. 

They population roughly 9 million 28k cases reported, likely testing states would confirmed 1 million cases now. Realistically probably 2 - 3 million infected 18,000-30,000 people died.

Also take number said grain salt, stuff publicly known excess death figures assuming covid broad base remain consistent death rate, also assumes countries number infections given level restrictions adherence restrictions. post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

I sympathy folks. unable reason, unable participate society. I'm wearing mask everywhere anyway trigger Y'all Queda Kinda thing travel requirement I've found grandparent age parents telling (working age) children get vaccinated allowed visit works wonders else would take ended restrictions?

There restrictions. little restrictions existed tossed aside spring certainly come back force. Many normal folks believe right. writing ""lunatics"" makes look bad. Nobody wants open conversation somebody like you. heard started J&amp;J Moderna booster way go. started Moderna great reputation thinking using J&amp;J booster. Main point being, using two different vaccines seems like might provide broader spectrum things immune system look for. anyone actual knowledge stuff I'd hearing it. USA?  also lost count many different ways people told order food fix it. food good, need hacked. Well done animal style really move needle. see even thread.  Interesting. 18 hours too.  understand population China.  post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:
  
[Vaccine FAQ Part FAQ Part appointment bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* :( answer question though... Yes many variants, know main variants basically guess flu season. variant got flu shot came around years later, still want another shot. I've heard places putting unvaccinated people unpaid leave future deadline point they'll fired.    Interesting almost month old.   gets better. guy's name Troy McCoy. Since want make comparison, is: 

In event woman admitted hospital pain, can’t demand prescribed birth control pills treatment. 

If receives prescription outside provider, can’t demand hospital staff administer them. 

That EXACT thing applies Ivermectin. booked daughter tentative shot 11/06. happy we’ll vaxxed boosted Thanksgiving. shitty last one made feel next day think I’ll hold say there’s need. Yeah, remember context. tests available, possible way us get good reliable data time. people Cali really. know everyone outside Cali heard hype tried feelings do. also stay home (again?) Thanksgiving. legit confused read comment realized people consider Tucker Carlson news clicked place. That's thinking. case also quite bit milder mine. handled pretty easy, mine easily lasted maybe 3-5 days hers. please learn government doesn’t expect thing grandchildren. thought better that. Eh, people said thing India wave done, doubt number fudging, state Florida far better August looking hospitalizations positivity rate. 

Florida reached herd immunity, terrible way it. Though inevitable many people exposed virus anyway, wonder strict mandates simply kicks road. Oregon example strict Covid mandates, cases still high awhile. think applies many people, personally. antibody measurement specific threshold. Immune responses pretty random. test probably shows number also. Slippery slope there. take meds psychiatric conditions 15 years. I’m vaccinated, wear masks, believe science. everyone disagrees mentally ill way someone mentally ill, it’s really condescending hear used joke. might misinformed.  Whoops. right -- 144 million. Less 1/2 US. know thought populous is. got there, pharmacist kind convinced get Moderna, claiming slightly better efficacy Pfizer, did. 28 hours feel little tired today mild chills fever, arm's little sore injection site. that, I'm fine. worth 5-10 years lol. mean, coworker got vaccine soon available yet wife still thinks make magnetic. rolls eyes.  Good riddance. Learn play others. thought saying 3rd shot generally low symptom. least seen. I'm immensely disappointed Florida government put ""Redditors furious"" real headline. think mandates continue big public sides public transit awhile. Examples immunocompromised people getting sick even dying come mind instantly… people long term conditions made worse infection, matter benign may seem exist (I’m one them). Vaccination reduces chance long-covid half, 100%. it’s important many people possible vaccinated, reduces likelihood breakthrough case there’s less virus going around exposed potentially cause rare breakthrough case.  Sesame Place? What? tomfoolery?  I'm banking least 1-2 more.

I think get one winter spike maybe another variant spike. That's topic addressing. commenting many people legitimately believe removing masks eat drink impact risk whatever doing. Sounds like classic Munchausen syndrome.  EUA would next week review ACIP board CDC. Director CDC would sign EUA. actual study [bit Receiving 2 vaccine doses associated lower risks outcomes. Associations prior vaccination outcomes SARS-CoV-2 infection marked &lt; 60 years-old, whereas robust associations observed ≥ 60 years-old.

...is still quite far quoted headline. Get third doses. Non-Paywalled Archive:  Archive: plan : )  unvaxxed counties western slope. look Denver/Boulder, cases elevated flat months.  requirement going enforced OSHA. federal, matter move. almost businesses comply fines going high enough they're going risk random anti-vax employee.   feel fortunate Fox loving southern family listened Fox one.  I’m honestly concerned violence people get hurt. issues regular adult vaccination centers, people absolutely lose comes kids reason. Unfortunately looks like 1/3 parents plan vaccinating 5-11 yr olds. get - young child super trepidatious first line anti-vaxxing father law died COVID restored healthy fear child getting long COVID permanent lung damage.  parents probably 35 tops feel risk low. rational decision selfish small-minded COVID-19 test all.

To fair, recall correctly really even *have* tests available yet Feb 2020 regular healthcare settings. Remember screwed up, rejected tests went turned bunk?  take OCD, yeah latch onto suck withdrawal effects awful psychiatric meds. actually read beyond headlines big fine. Got moderna booster morning.. first two shots, really sore arm within couple hours.. booster shot, Zero symptoms far, arm feels great.   yell ""smoke bomb!"" run, they're still trying find smoke bomb, smoke might produced. culture shock pretty intense within mainland too. example someone taking flight Miami (where people care masks places require them) Portland (where get shamed wearing one banned places.)

And thing is, nobody really completely right here. People vastly different risk tolerance. really need reshape things low risk tolerance wear N95 masks protect themselves, leave rest us alone.  surprisingly small percentage. ... 20% 25% vaccine mandate going get vaccine? would depressing manufacture enough vaccine distribute fast enough. unvaccinated people US point chose be, that's best outcome could ever hoped for. long covid ""permanent"" covid, many reports long covid sufferers making full recoveries time. clench bit anytime decline starts plateau (like now). knows go next? Hardly necessary. let us country (assuming US) two years anyway, get next month (rightly) foreign travellers matter require proof full vaccination negative PCR test allowed in. Seems adequate without separating loved ones tanking tourist economy needlessly. Thankfully, rule science mathematics. could treat language something care about, often  OJ still looking real killer. would easier would comply.  Hope worth it. I'm triple vaxxed vaccinated family members still vulnerable even mild case, I'm moving life still wearing mask. Everyone's situation different. Thanks advice though. Article: Participants studies breakthrough infections resulting long covid concluded happens people recieved ***only first dose*** fully vaccinated people far better protection long covid. 


Headline: **VACCINE PROTECT LONG COVID**  


And still can't stand media. Knocked teenage employee unconscious fractured jaw. Rather wear mask.

Egos even fragile jaws, guess.

FAFO I’m getting weird taste thing jnj booster.

I asked Moderna pharmacist asked wouldn’t mind getting jnj low Moderna. kind wish driven another pharmacy also lost day total lethargy too. also like car insurance ? Wearing seatbelt ? Elevator maintenance requirements? 4 year old 1 year old able get vaccinated shortly 5-12 years olds. Give till we’ll good. deserve name. 
He blood related *Laughs USA* think parents it’s “I dont know long term effects either one actively making kids get passive risk contracting. 

Not saying it’s right wrong raising one objection I’ve heard.   Eastern Europe, I’m sure refutes point current disparity testing levels China allow independent fact finding authoritarian government never allows independent fact finding. That's evidence anything. Dying issue getting covid, I’m sure you’re aware point.  True either way get vaccine move life. Large pockets unvaccinated people rural areas getting infected Thanks. Yup digging found information. Ironically got Moderna booster today (got Pfizer originally). Thanks! Delta still raging, rural areas north (Montana, Wyoming, Minnesota, Alaska) instead south. It’s practically gone south since already infected everyone could host. Protected group. Although point, given protected groups includes anybody 18 BMI 25.0, adult population U.S. qualifies.   Honestly, I'm fearful long-term effects COVID child. many young kids getting hospitalized, died, I'm still nervous long-term respiratory (and other) consequences may subtle. doubtful catastrophic, anything might limit 5-year-old's potential concern.  -- 220 million people 

Russia 220 millions inhabitants. require antipsychotics Drive-thru. I'm giving double double animal style they're checking vax cards inside. substitute Merck's drug. Molnupiravir given hospitalized patients reduces risk death half. Fluvoxamine might lower risk severe COVID 30% taking time getting infected. Outdoor stadium bit different indoor (and likely drunken) gatherings, though. play devils advocate:

1) evidence China allow real fact finding facility. access, evidence.

2) indication cross species transmission despite lot effort find it.

3) one know claimed lab ""highly contaminated"". appears exaggeration non-facts. 

I speculate staff member lab accidently contaminated went market causing initial spread. speculation valid anyone's.

If conclusion, error bars wide enough would amount W.A.G. really matter cannot conclusively determined?  Thanks, anti-vaxxers. looks like thanks guys, *our* vaccines stopped working. pfizer. generally available booster protected group? Incorrect. failed realize lure USA Russians.

damn that's good take

It sickens see incredibly dumb &amp; selfish people are. AWESOME!!! Wow! aware. Hopefully works, shown larger clinical trials.  COVID Zero letting COVID spread among masses unvaccinated two options?   mom already giving grief shouldn’t vaccinate kids years it’s approved. heard news don’t know long term side effects. seriously unfathomable damage Tucker Carlsons world doing. need wear mask apply unemployment?  know. I'd imagine parents would careful vaccines comes kids versus themselves. know said want wait see kids take know sure everything fine. vast majority parents think way, might see huge uptick right away. also depends whether kids still going school. 

My cousin's school gave in-person September entire classrooms students exposed said everyone another semester online learning. Parents kids online school may wait longer parents kids go person. think general consensus that's starting form getting covid worse anything vaccine could do. Seriously, patients get demand whatever medicine want, want morphine cocaine prescribed chronic illness. Enough speedballs I’ll probably convince cured it, least little while…  u get animal style? 3,000 highest number FDA requires phase 3 trial.

The smallest 300. Even daily 7-days sketchy. Look trends 7-day.  going win God hope right.  Would trust gvt Putin's? Contrary popular belief Russian well aware gvt's corruption. get either. one publically threw fits previous year's flu vaccinations unless CDC, whomever one predicts latest greatest flu would be, guessed wrong.

I flu shot since kid. caught Influenza sucked rocks, put kid week almost shut schools down. caught every flu/cold going around kid school schools breeding grounds diseases viruses there. 

COVID put hospital. reason already COVID shot state two phase roll qualify Phase One. got called told eligible make appointment Phase Two day popped positive COVID. Massively sucked. Even another doctor gives specific type medicine?

 think tricky situation around. New Mexico + Colorado spikes less ideal. (Two early vaccinated states) We're going need open boosters vaccinated 6-8 months ago, since appears mRNA vaccines need least 3 dose series. I'm betting we'll start seeing waning immunity causing problems winter months. easy decipher booster list (Just say 18+ 6 months dose 2) tamp reproductive rate enough could kill wave like Israel UK seeing track, proactive rather reactive like been.  MMR 2 doses: 1st dose age 12-15 months 2nd dose age 4-6. Polio 4 doses, however, 3 within 1st 15 months life. sure. Let's include lack resources public education well. Incorrect. adults. even EUA (yet) 5-11. EUA come today tomorrow. Omar got them....everybody scared pick up..... Second this! 5- part series make sure follow links part 1 end later segment.

It's clear, easy follow makes lot sense.

I can't imagine website would problem, know link rules here.  elastics almost always break time. love problem solves itself. epidemiologist, Pfizer employee, know answer.

I'm belief trials normally large pool willing participants study, resources logistics so.

The large studies would significantly bolster statistical confidence vaccine slated wide usage.

I think time, COVID-19 vaccines likely thoroughly evaluated vaccines history vaccines. think antivaxxers spouses also same? many restaurants vaccine mandates? many pay much office jobs? US covid relief package. 

As far tell, looks like Merck made agreements countries offer med tiered levels, capping price negotiated prices.  That's totally fair true point see long term symptoms life altering changes demand immediate action. might uninformed long term effects think big ones lung scarring long loss taste/smell. Lung scarring bad one. know bad lung scarring average, I'm going make comparison that's probably apples oranges fairly severe asthma whole life cake walk. Maybe month grab rescue inhaler else breathe uncomfortably. daily symbicort keeps perfectly fine. can't imagine lung scarring much/at worse severe asthma. case asthma really impact life all. takes extra minute run mile 🤷 live pretty pampered society much impact. I'm saying kids vaccinated, I'm saying anybody scared vaccine, I'm mostly making argument children robust strong people covid restrictions lifted schools. parents teachers ones take risk 100% guarantee every parent would risk getting sick kid perfect education. Hence statement vaccinate parents teachers first. Parents teachers risk death vaccinated. Kids risk death. risk potentially long term effects eyes outweigh value growing normal society pre covid. Wife COVID back beginning September. Around end September tested positive antibodies, tested negative. told wait bit come back. went back today tested negative antibodies. reason might happening? Maybe antibodies threshold test checks for? Luckily, one said otherwise. Europe seems main culprit driving this. Boosters getting children vaccinated essential. good “worrying” affected? People going people, happens force small businesses enforce government policy. seen rural job postings state specifically say ""vaccination status required""... example care home SE Oregon... SMH. 


So guess crazy's need move boonies. appreciate people would definitely like aspect. yet find mask end drying eyes making water, I'm going miss wear one.

Getting pfizer booster 2 hours, annoyance antivaxxers crank another notch. could done masks, no, course not, we're stuck indefinitely point.

Well, people are. Non-compliance going time. estimate probably 20% people see store wearing masks now. infection rate drops expect compliance continue drop along it. demonizing use dangerous medication context unintended use. 

You're getting downvoted true. ""Demonize"" charged language though.

People going commands label uses prescription medication. Full stop. bail reopening cases started going up? it’s worse inferior, it’s non treatment. like enema brain cancer. pain meds? want narcotics Im suing calling cops! I'm afraid Greg since know involved history public displays violence.  like million times human withstand dying.

Sounds like challenge ""insisting providers give treatments COVID-19 authorized, clinically approved, within guidelines established FDA CDC.""

One word, projection. can't stop vaccine mandates (which support), force way around ""well, I'll get way"" attitude. Hospitals discharge patient wants treatment. new policy patients want non-FDA treatments could cause harm, discharged safety. weird part countries started flailing around using early pandemic (Brazil comes mind), first half **2020**.

But … *less medically literate* … US latch onto much later, became clear HCQ didn’t jack shit. 

They can’t understand things like modern antivirals vaccine tech, reach “old” “common” drugs make feel like control something. OP said sane healthcare workers. ones vaxx welcome leave.

Edit: oops except MT passed law healthcare workers can't forced vaccinated terrifying. Folks saying every spike. good thought number counterpoints. instance, make better fight next time? many cases sure. others may opposite, long haul symptoms lungs weakened state. accidentally boycotting life apparently. tanked sales projections yet?  Every ""abrupt ending"" prediction thing wrong. I've personally seen indication optimistic prediction different.

Also, keep mind take ~2 weeks symptoms show up. assuming people xmas new years parties, middle January would see upticks events. assuming opposite.

Also also, ending mask mandates mean over. usually ends prolonging rising numbers cases.

I mean offense, well thought prediction anyone who's lived last 2 years crap.   Stated redacted comment responded to. happens ass-u-me?  know many total get take one thing sure: massive disparities uptake based geography socioeconomic status. Government can't tell eat day old room temperature meat! 

Let market decide. /s Buh BYE. Redacted came hoping hear people echo assumptions? tough messaging health practitioners. got Pfizer booster felt little tired day that's it. vaccines work. Get one yet. vaccine “tech” new point. saying n god tier compare burger king completely false.  there's fucking Colorado.   Like r/Covid19 J&amp;J vaccine uses technology ""traditional"" vaccines, effectiveness wane ""rapidly"" suggesting, logical reason believe might long term consequences. Stop spreading bullshit.   Received Moderna booster last week. Absolutely effects. Israel big spike nation either vaccinated it. check studies exact ages data people 2021 spikes.

&amp;#x200B;

second infections confirmed probably depends condition person exact mutation virus Ummm even read post yours? Negaunee people vaccinated. FL sunk ocean Imagine doctor forced give antibiotics someone knee pain, would fly happen. reason, people believe COVID forced vaccine mandates, want to...force dewormer people?? Hvae lost damn minds? Hopefully means Delta variant run course. haven’t keeping up, concerning variants noted (that appear level Delta?) know Mu mentioned back, doesn’t appear taken off, differentiated enough Delta. add zero ends numbers? Hopefully vaccines get full FDA authorization school districts add COVID-19 list required vaccinations fall. Imagine doctor forced give antibiotics someone knee pain, would fly happen. 

It happens. mom ER nurse, people would come shit like colds viral infections demand antibiotics. course doctor says no, that's going help we're going prescribe it. patients complain hospital administration suit comes says ""prescribe damn antibiotics get here"" want negative customer reviews affect profit margins. antibiotic resistant bacteria. manage die first. Britain Russia reported mutated Delta+ strain believe \~10% infectious original Delta, heard much last two weeks. matter time though, since every country different capacities test/ sequence virus, we're gonna identify potentially problematic variants they've already spread fairly widely. Fuck em. Keep religion yourself. dad got positive Antigen test RTPCR negative. anyone tell virus not?  Thanks, looks way off. know culture personal protection paramount people discuss carrying 9mm vs. .45 ACP makes zero sense take line approach. Personal protection mask.  guys sure close, that's really heartwarming. Nice keep track test scores years.   Thanks. issue actually covid protection, international travel without vaccinated 'approved' vaccine hard/impossible currently. Throw bad US/Russia relations causing visa issues (US Embassy basically working Russia currently), we're afraid situation MIL travel european country get new US visa her's expires, able enter countries without vaccinated. currently approved vaccines available Russia- fact illegal receive Pfizer vaccine currently.


This could moot point global travel restrictions ease 6-12 months, want stuck behind 'vaccine curtain' requirements stay place several years. Vaccines clinical trials SARS-CoV-1 mid-2000s. (somewhat) lucky SARS-CoV-2 similar groundwork vaccine already done. Oh also unlimited resources around world attention researchers fact many people got infected (which speeds able determine efficacy clinical trials compared placebo) might helped too. 

Vaccine design severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus
Yuxian et al. Viral Immunol. Coronavirus Vaccine (SARS-CoV) Study vaccine development: SARS MERS COVID-19 Vaccine Get Developed funny always people vehemently antivax suddenly friends ""almost died vaccine.""  want charge medical care, fuck hospital? perfectly valid choice go alone, everyone understand present hospital care, going get care DEEM BEST, fuck attorney general GD stupid can't fathom that. I've times. agree better BK thinnest margins. choices BK InO, would eat whatever pantry. anyone worried abuse workers facing anti-maskers anti-vaxxers. echo chamber? tests returned upside didn’t you? Jesus, can’t keep holding hand everything. Get together. long virus can't spread low R, goes vanishing

You forget Covid's major trump card... infect every mammal ACE-2 receptors stable host populations humans continue mutate even swap genes animal born Beta Coronaviruses, much like flu.

As such, phase pandemic might waning, always going threat since new variant/ hybridized strain pop another animal reservoir time bring us back square one point, also like many strains Influenza monitor yearly know matter time.  new school rule introduced required schools test lead water. Rural school districts fought it, cost testing. state found money pay tests. schools argued would expensive found lead. went one meeting. like Parks Rec. 

The law passed. Well science taught well mandatory higher levels secondary school.

It also help PM's idiot. Right. got 2nd shot end March, kids got June. caught delta variant beginning August. wife got booster week. like weird cold bad. loss taste smell weirdest part, symptoms typical cold symptoms. Nothing worrisome, hospital visits, otc cold meds trying rest. worst part covid dealing fact tested positive quarantining, work. countless phone calls state's health department, dealing HR work wife's work get compensated out, bla bla. Dealing kid's school. Daughter f high school class work due classroom work stuff. Covid cost lot money have. suddenly quarantine prepared go anywhere 2 weeks sucks. spent way much food grocery delivery ended getting behind bills. Amazon, postmates, grubhub made ton money due covid. Thankfully, I'm caught life back normal(ish), one hospitalized worse. Get vaccines folks. 2 3 month inconvenience normal life better losing loved ones planning funerals. Economic shut going happen, choice shutdown stop people dying shutdown people dying   I'm pretty sure expected now. Interestingly, South seeing cases fall faster places - probably everyone already got it. 

My state estimating case counts would drop back previous levels sometime late December - least variant comes along. Hopefully getting enough 5-11 year olds vaccinated get numbers high enough make herd immunity possible, least places actually believe vaccination.  Well, that's crazy talk. :D   Good? Thinning herd"
