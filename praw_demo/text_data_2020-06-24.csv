0,2020-06-24," cause people make money assistance fact think alot ppl realized much people piss quarantine. Exactly, hell CDC director before? much funding need appear say something guidance needed? funding issue god's sake. incompetence issue. room bag? Lost lot weight recently. pay overage charged. Correct, wasn’t widespread. multiple hotspots run less time.  Witness Cuomo Yeah, know fucking put coronavirus patients anymore. know every nursing home FL got free test 80 % came back negative COVID19? Funny works. bring virus vulnerable target get It’s couple states, it’s half country showing progress. And, good portion states businesses open nearly two months. states started trend up. But, it’s reddit, due economic activity.  CA strict, opened much later, one worst states. can’t possibly mass protests, apparently people crowding together yelling 4 hours two weeks straight can’t possibly issue primary means virus transmission droplets. haircuts people getting ice cream. Better get way August 24th. quite pesky RNC.

They seriously politicizing pandemic. know Fred Meyer always seems enough money hire someone follow around store look suspicious enough day.  agree entirely business US kind things. +39,103 beats previous mark 39,072 set April 24th.

think set record cases previous 7 days graphs update tomorrow morning, beating mark set April 10th 221,000 cases week.

two weeks ago 140,000 new cases week.

there little reason think continue get worse least another 2-3 weeks. run Governor production masks citizens really want protect health. People now. leadership answered silence. Protect yourself. Imperial College also going US tests I’ve heard 60% way what? quarantine indefinite torture, waiting naively vaccine may may effective, may may arrive next year, etc., economy would crippled beyond repair. don’t recall *any* credible models projected millions dead end June. recall models involve millions dead time mythical herd immunity achieved, models longer time scales, currently total percentage people infected way levels needed achieve that. source “forecasts millions deaths”? I’m asking source specific reason. (humans) tendency anchor perception well badly think comparison. expected millions dead, 120,000 dead Americans looks like done well. consider South Korea USA saw first case day, hundreds deaths? Well, stark reality failure comes focus. Wow. stupid stupid, huh? Israel can’t it, think it’s safe say won’t ‘normal’ life without vaccine eradication. 

Acting things normal globally connected world temporary sensation. Infection numbers don’t matter death rate down. Look covid metrics. It’s decreasing

Edit 1: 2: lol downvotes facts goes y’all feel That's I'm moving Germany.

Thank God dual citizenship. Can't recommend nurx enough want start continue birth control hard time getting drs appointment. substitute face face appointment gyno better going without contraception. mentality terrifying? right thing do. Limit travel since still contact tracing since federal government incompetent, states need step up. Enforced how? make reasonable accommodations. 'hey, give list, shop you, come inside on!y pay.'

You let people spread germs. Herd impunity. mean open am. risking though. We're still supposed students come back U classes fall. can't imagine going well... It’s phase 3, it’s combined phase 2/3 trial takes much longer. It’s also permanent vaccine wearing masks means libs win. No, really. That's reason. America become divided point Dems AOC said breathing good must it, least 30% population would hold breath. think 2,500 person sample size enough scale assumption? Lol Joe Rogan keeps saying wear masks jk jk .... skin color anything? think likely gonna happen tbh Selfishness deadly Well, good thing people Florida taking thing responsible things like PPE social distancing 

Oh wait...shit... Kids \#1 vector passing disease families. arguing bad faith. never implied said studies pseudoscience. I'm saying site linked is. studies article even say author article saying. 

Im going argue poor understanding science, science works. girlfriend fortunate parents still living. One day, longer case, you’ll likely regret spending time family. understand pandemic, do. surviving living thing. mid July, we're going seeing several major metros overrun hospitals.

people said exact thing mid april.  BAH GAWD KILLED 'IM feel awful health care professionals Texas, responsible folks right thing wearing masks social distancing. can't imagine frustration groups must feel watching horror show general population stupid antics. Agreed. time need switch roles. us about, told stay home, get go home. treated like sort pissing contest take essential duties.   There’s chunk people don’t qualify unemployment face worst job market lives too. everyone that! “Informative information”. 

Lmao. Cut chase, need goddamn novel.. Woah woah woah, that’s gotta least 7 weeks 1 day ago.... I've got nothing love American brethren take wrong way keep COVID infested asses fuck away country. It’s combined phase 2/3 trial. It’s going take time, grant temporary immunity. doesn’t mean shouldn’t optimistic though talking boss today (we working home since Mid-March) told went office lot surround businesses left... can't even imagine this, office main street little town right outside San Francisco. always busy hub local businesses, I've gotten know many workers owners lunch-time last two years... even know going back to... sad. 120k dead covid. 100k pneumonia deaths half confirmed covid.

The death toll already close 200k. Need help assessing risk! met friend today outdoor picnic, together two hours. hugging good bye end found contact someone tested positive COVID-19 3 days ago.... friend symptoms person contact Miley symptoms (lost sense taste smell). person testing positive wearing mask contact move piece furniture apartment. I’m seeing mom tomorrow, lot health conditions, mainly heart disease. also live boyfriend immunocompromised studio... likely would contract covid-19 this? possible spread day infected???? state mask wearing edicts, one exception renders toothless. 

This target whatever reason, don’t wear em. subset group think tyranny whatever nonsense using assert constitutional rights. 

So here’s loophole exceptions directive people difficulty breathing wearing mask, disability prevents wearing one,

There instructions passed around particular sphere people tell people invoke rights protection. Using ADA HIPAA laws allow exempt. mock conversation:

“You must wear masks please” 

“I medical condition prevents wearing one”

“What condition that?”

“Under protections afforded HIPAA privacy laws, cannot ask disclose nature condition”

And that’s that. cannot. don’t prove condition. one. 

I’d post image found passed around I’m sure sub allows (I never see images posted here). dexamethasone? lot

Redemsivir issued us county public health e.g. government controlled distribution. clearly opening everything back good idea!! 200k deaths November optimistic figure.

I understand many people take crisis seriously. different- could easy. surprised pikachu face Nice know number Americans brain 50% Mouse Knows All! favorite “I sure degree credentials” says women YouTube education virology 90% job done home yet company wont budge idea working home... always thought figured this, coronavirus stay home order pretty much proved true. Bear mind vaccines (Oxford’s particular) grant temporary immunity hard mass produce. vaccines like Imperial College’s seem grant permanent immunity made could fit 2 million doses 1 litre bottle, making much easier mass produce, they’re saying they’ll 40 million doses next summer.    Median age diagnosed could decreasing due increased testing capacity vs early pandemic. Younger people much likely receive test would driving median age. However, ratio young old people becoming infected may well still same. 

There obviously factors nursing homes stricter protocols could driving median age. Unfortunately however, almost next impossible completely isolate vulnerable populations. matter time vulnerable populations become infected high enough level infection community. 

With deaths lagging indicator still early tell. good news see increase daily death rate middle July. However, increase hospitalization seeing around country society continuing open much population adhering public health guidance, I'm super optimistic. shit Religion, starters. wife 3rd trimester regular appointments, that's NY always case graphic ignore 46-54 year olds? I've seen numbers ranging 11 22 older reports; imagine would country likely even state dependent since would rely speed/timing diagnosis (including factors).  argument seems repeat much CEO's make, argument make much. make much. Protest cancelled felt coronavirus situation could slow motion train wreck early year. prepared *slow* train wreck is. ""Then suddenly thousands people start protesting""

Well no. spontaneous protesting. reaction numerous amount killer cop incidents. characterization situation wrong. Black people 2 epidemics fighting. governments can’t afford kind thing, somethings atleast open realistically get economy alive Oh, sweet summer child.

They get sick, end disability consider government handout, die. 

Instead kill random people ever know. 

Evil sad tendency live longer. live place restrictions never lifted. massive spike aftermath protests however. Exactly, dont call white man robbing black one ”reverse mugging.” seemed like least 2 weeks, month cases spiking deaths spiking. Lots variables, depending ages spreads first etc. 

Also depends many infections hit hospitals once. Death rates spike capacity reached hospitals icus. 

Seems like delay cases ever briefly heading down, deaths drop off. new “World Clorox” water spectacular isn’t quite finished yet.  Right? actually brain showed leadership 🤦🏽‍♂️ Disney president 2020 missed nice sit luxury meal local Arby's  wanted light ""inside body""

He idiots do, took something heard proudly twisted dumb idea.

He right link??s bad, super hyped today. think Trump admin fans would listen, especially foreigners. worrying... results less 24hrs. called appointments 10am,got tested 2pm got results 9pm. pay. Turd Lady Alcatraz exact new information previously unknown mankind came cloth face coverings last months? hair majority, actually think that's way he'll ever take seriously. Borris Johnson same, initially dismissed it, seriously got ill let rip.. losing $$$ second. always make babies good. family lives germany way old getting sick. keep dumbasses outttt can’t feel bad happened honestly Congrats! like moment first plane hit world trade center. truth always bottom comments. Mainly elderly...Trump already planned decrease Medicare funding put money wall. Guess puts closer that... Fyi : cases plant may detected healthcare offices. company 800 tests AFAIK privately. 
All negative, seems unlikely due outbreak going around four weeks.

Subcontractors man meatplant forced employees work even symptoms, long dont got proof theyre infected. Workers foreigners dont know rights.

Local state officials seem severly underestimated threat lulled nothing.

Heads must roll. caught recovered, would bring every day- kicked ass, bad, he's healthiest ever, cold, etc.

He able share multiple things play
1. US government mess initial testing response. guy never admits wrong, ever. need deny downplay.
2. Disaster pandemic response hard work. 18 hours day, 7 days week working branches government, states, countries, private sector. guy works 2 hours day, tops.
3. Early leadership realized virus hitting elderly minorities worst. core voting block. Business owners - want risk losing 10 percent wealth. bailout package passed, pandemic over. Limiting bars 75% capacity, whatever ambiguous %, actually kind ridiculous. lot bars patroned pandemic never 75% capacity... furthermore, usually part restaurant! restaurant stops serving food people clear out, bars capacity greatly increases! people drinking going go sit tables, usually standing around bar yelling loud music! that, handwashing social distancing bathroom open trough basically non-existent esp someone 4+ drinks... establishment may 75% capacity, still going mass chaos. also help people literally places. ""Social Distancing"" ""Bars"" polar opposite activities. Nsjeje Well, per capita US double triple Sweden Portugal.  hope selfish irresponsible guys go outside crowds, sadly young dumb number likely made parents (""hurray inheritance legal murder!"") people unrelated them. :/ Right leaning even hate McConnell. way, I've asking people would Covid vaccine, people said no. friend governor. basically people flash 'idiot' cards going get packed to-go orders told get curbside service/delivery allowed anyway.

...Which person actual disability probably would do, doing, done. MLB players least concerns.

Be worried people wear masks, walk around asymptomatic spreading everyone! three test positive say 'Beetlejuice', Beetlejuice appears. I’m working Trauma ER we’re testing everybody without symptoms. rest hospital. yes, we’re probably missing asymptomatic people haven’t visited us. 3-4 weeks behind. use convalescent serum prophylactically tho? understanding helps already sick fighting disease, confer immunity uninfected individual. Almost every country world mass protests Lol. Google friend hey. Well, let's look statistics see self.
Vietnam country 0% death rate.
According : (797 infected), Mongolia (215 infected), Faroe Islands (187 infected) plenty also 0% death rate. Even politically unstable territory people protesting 1180 infected cases 8 deaths (~0,005%). countries fake statistics well?

It entirely believable, refuse believe whatever reasons have. Focusing number Covid deaths entirely myopic - akin putting focus finding plaster finger cut real danger legs chopped off. 

It really matter legs chopped already bled death.

Nice predictions. die home ***might*** need bed someone else. first showing theater Contagion. Better phone. sarcasm works help infected person. can't use convalescent plasma prophylactically Healthy 30 1% death rate. Maybe obese. Additionally, Latvian CDCP publishes lot data here, Latvian language - 

Top row:

* Left - Tests done orange, confirmed cases blue plotted calendar dates
* Middle - Case count among males(blue)/females(orange) specific age groups
* Right - 14-day cumulative incidence plot number cases, starting March

Bottom row:

* Left - Active (blue), recovered (green), dead (orange) cumulative cases time
* Middle - Deaths patients confirmed covid-19, among males (blue)/females(orange) specific age groups
* Right - Inpatient (hospitalized) numbers time Gee astute prediction. many need call global pandemic? Return lockdown? I've furloughed. I'm sitting waiting. go buy groceries. Lockdown never ended. person bought stocks money. gone.

If value stocks goes down, like bought car money value car drops 30% drive lot. car dealer bought car still money - disappear. Leadership. Covid-19 daily new cases bar chart perfect show (lack of) leadership US.

They're past point another lockdown. People refuse wear masks. Darwin, thing. guess we're going watch thing run course find get herd immunity vaccine. yesterday 32 people without direct connection meat plant tested positive, possible currently spreading community.  quite bit surprised acting influence realtionship much already, mean sanctioned (and neighbours) times like would terror state. wtf building gas pipeline bit independent times behaviour certain persons charge totally unpredictable ? Projections worthless constantly adjusted could guy president wanted trump would politicizing fact, tho. would say he's strong, mild cold, etc. able help himself, plus would use single outcome evidence reopen even harder. Hawaii must limit, perhaps 10,000 active cases time, 900 active cases 1.57 reach 10,000 8 weeks, r number tool planning hard fact. guy who’s responsible 120k dead **Americans **

At point OP claim Trump responsible Coronavirus across globe? wonder still feel need defend moron. I’m assuming it’s it’s finally someone see in. paraphrase Ellen Ripley Aliens, 'You see fucking restart economy'. Cooperation state isn’t bad. virus political views. doesn’t matter care not. reality long let coronavirus run amok damage economy people going killed severely injured it. 

The federal state governments need get asses make masks mandatory, fines noncompliance all. 

Things can’t go back “normal” every time get things control uneducated apathetic population says fuck start square one again. 

If don’t keep preventative measures quarantine waste time money makes sacrifices health care works citizens made vain. Yay! country sucks u can’t tell. Lol, what? 8,000 people die? 30,000 active cases. well. Australia prob open New Zealand, that’s it. US cases protesting last 3 weeks.  Slow learners. That's outsider take away this. really seem like cult point. Trickle economics fucking bull shit. one either side simply gives away money, fuck would anyone think super rich gonna let flow downward. They're going use money increase capital make money. 

When poor money spend *spend* good service, give away corporations. Trickle economics always beneficial economy trickle extends wealth gap classes. man peculiar position. America war Vietnam, would almost certainly dead. happened 46-54 year olds? Ignorance ~~bliss~~ covid-19. border control quite incompetent initially. [They require quarantine travellers US including NY epicentre May nice see loved ones window? Good. forgot now. obviously thinking. let play out. wanna attend Raiders game LV year Oh that's Fiend seen since Wrestlemania? Heck yeah won... oh wait. Marvel ICU?
Mickey Mortuary? Stop.

You're demeaning Americans *don't* want sound like whiny bitches we're sitting cleft stick cutting. Yeah, probably add live Japan. Nobody uses N95 surgical masks outside hospitals. Almost everyone [this sort sold convenience drug stores.

I believe people Asian countries generally use similar sort mask. Western foreigners people ever see wearing surgical masks respirator masks. nice see loved ones close up, face-to-face, real time. 

If get it, pity you. believe Fox News threat society, example terrible. There's literally tab devoted top page. I'm also sure counts page view, take much scroll coronavirus articles main page. 

 
 
That's little ""not covering COVID anymore."" saying diminishes point. right?! people could blame Trump, sad fact graph really shows American population see entitled rest world think rights affected magical unique way vs countries.  point, Floridians calling city councils members devil voting wearing face masks. today.  utterly bonkers.

For example, measles R0 12 18, number get herd immunity 93 95%.

SARS-CoV 2 R0 5.7, estimate value get herd immunity above.

Lastly, need remember COVID 19 new disease, world population little immunity it, almost everyone susceptible it. Hence, need high ratio people immune order halt infection. Minnesota. ""yeah, I'm really sorry y'all, ignorant irresponsible probably even spreading thing myself... I'm sorry...""

""Can y'all help medical bills, though?""

It’s bad headline. read article, it’s clear isn’t referring fact caused pandemic. He’s referring fact virus huge range symptoms, respiratory nature. That’s something unusual, respiratory illnesses typically follow predictable trajectory (the flu, SARS, etc). state? really sucks. feel people replan one-in-a-lifetime events.

Hah fair enough, another reason get Tesla basically priced concept cars, interiors shit compared mid range car days fox news\*\* hear ya, humped lot keep job. serenade lovely touch!  tradition: teen girls get birthday money go shopping. buy almost 100% clothes. Clothes try on, debate over, decide worth budget, love it. birthdays basically little shopping spree 2-3 friends along day, ended dinner all. way happening. *did* pick odds &amp; ends Target, wrapped them,and treasure hunt type thing. appreciated it, same. imagine old folks properties coasts laid empty soon..... companies would “ElOn MeAn TeSlA bAd” people.
They’re bad. IMO actually one important reasons need UBI. people job - give bargaining power people jobs. current system, low skilled labour abundant treat people interchangeable. people intimidated prospect work little while, workers easily stand rights.  Hmm, sort of. moment definitely eye opener terms Elon person, outside businessman.

But treatment employees notably shitty lot longer that. one got humors huge burnout engineering staff, worked force long hours flame leave. 

But top that, actually really obvious... he's billionaire. get without exploiting everyone can. Mother nature trying thin herd want let her... Thanks, hope family stay safe cptn_sugarbiscuits!

Hopefully VA stay right side curve going forward :) haircuts apparently. couple Christmas's ago laid bunch SpaceX people KSC. laid name mass list sent Christmas break, see work email holiday, lot people don't, allowed KSC, badges taken, sent home. either 10% 20% work force. also retired shuttle engineer beg apply SpaceX. said would let children work let alone someone met Everyone attending closed bar sharing drinks masks insurance deny claims. paying bill (via distributed costs) fucksticks go ventilators. premiums go up, blame Jimmy Tores ilk. Teslas always junk using green energy shield create hype. They've never good.

Honestly helpful aid solidarity Still see far many people wearing wearing masks improperly! work factory make auto parts Ford, Honda big automakers. worse. one wears masks, 6ft distancing. barely going motions. Tesla worse Damn, I’m still reusing n-95’s, send shit hospital. still PPE speak of. Tesla also asshole. Elon would probably get along. Confirmed via Twitter become strongest species?

This insane Lol, yes. One unlucky thousand mean? Actually Agree, flu yet bullet mankind. school district Michigan scrambling March get Chromebooks WiFi hotspots kids needed it. tough, made work. Luckily time we'll advanced notice get supplies needed. I've working getting laptops pieces technology ready inevitable (in mind) school closures come fall. shitty company.

Are Teslas really bad? I'd heard mostly positive things cars looked myself. dangerous thing air, get room open windows. Truth Georgia, long takes get test results vary location location. '15 minute' test get results leave. results 1-3 days. sucky ones take 7-10 days. Thank service. Anecdotally there's another problem. Mum works physician complaining ICUs locally artificially filled mild Covid patients pump reimbursements. Basically, since lockdowns cost money procedures, hospitals pushing uninsured patients ICU (who need it) admitting mild Covid patients unnecessarily government foot bill. ""We herd immunity now"" -organizer, maybe would love it. excuse wear tacky trump merch work public. would proud maga mask maga hat. Sir, may entitled substantial compensation. sure you’re downvoted. You’re able manufacture things without there. it’s done automation robots, likely wouldn’t job anyway This, bad outweigh good vice versa. 


*Of course* China's numbers lies. That's type dictatorship works. negate fact also clearly flattened curve mixture repression flexibility, using new tech grassroots social control effectively consistently. Nope, sorry disagree Gavin done great job. entitled rich people Orange County selfish people trying get everything reopen far early.

If Gavin messed anything giving financial pressure reopen early. classic Elon behavior. Stop fooled shitposting cool rockets Vince killing product. He's potentially killing employees families.  Certainly, one projecting. That's 2 million dead, good ratios, time virus run population. 

Figure discount 30% since reach herd immunity 70% would give us upper range 1.4 million dead...it really throw cold water idea... Damn, that’s *deep* mountains 😀 Slept one night AT. read article would see people got terminated contractors. employees. It’s actually really annoying coz want like guy mean, Tesla SpaceX notoriously shit places work. grind staff dirt bring fresh meat current workforce gets sick working there. 

Also, listen Elon’s second Joe Rogan podcast appearance. dude take virus seriously all. See thing is, fair number Americans able live massive coronavirus surge. Well that's fine sherriffin' boys. Mighty fine.  shit makes sense me, cheapest easiest way slow spread. practically everyone find face covering, till there's vaccine effective treatment option pretty much got   Looks like they're going next NYC. :( wish southern states listened brushed off. diseases ever deliberately eradicated. disease ever seen massive, coordinated public health response disease has. impossible means that, development vaccine, SARS-COV-2 eliminated within months years. love disneyworld. times count. dont think smart open rn. u disagree explain dont think smart Quebec way better recently! 674 cases last week. Sub-100! Ontario sitting 1400 last week, that's still improvement, better (most) US states. really good news! great see Sweden's neighbors protecting themselves. really hope helps Sweden recognize herd immunity strategy failed, pushes quickly resolutely implement Test, Trace, Isolate infrastructure they've talking WEEKS now. positive indicators testing front far, tracing front too. great hope TTI enough bring Sweden's caselaod way down. Everyone area wants happen Norics open again. agree. Everyone keeps saying things like unacceptable boycott one brand that's shitty embrace brands shitty.

Falsely assuming pay attention headlines content de facto Trump state media organization like FNC. It’s possible criticize someone without fan guy charge either. so? Protests lead infections (no rise NYC Chicago example) people sitting 8-10 feet apart outdoors going spread this? RemindMe! 1 week speak Sweden's favor. actually starting take rational measures. internationally? Depending progress lack thereof containing virus may let fucked? Like stop? grandparents going die? feels hopeless. Numbers going daily. speak  blatant much appealing way thinking violent ways trying put end (in countries). clear risk create even higher peaks (on spread). set pond river hold river certain level eventually get huge flow period. **It better let slow trickle through.** keep control take care need harm community immunity** could thus also relevant Sweden.  **We little cautious using word** breathes little given about, says Anders Tegnell.  basic idea probably starting become relevant see virus, **this need get. control part Tegnell says halting spread short term bad idea better let ""small trickle"" reduce overall harm?

You've proved wrong hero. people need rules default “what’s me”

They ones say can’t possibly good person aren’t brand Christianity otherwise reason moral. really don’t get people right thing believe right thing. 

Even without regulations, trump probably could worn maga mask every one followers would wearing day, even bed. *not single rebuttal seen day* seems mask resistance around areas common (and expected) remove mask keep stay. I've people mockingly ask me, ""Do put mask back in-between bites drinks?""

They seem grasp breath people walking table, well decide get use restroom. Sure, inoculate whoever dining with, confined people dining together, happen mask worn sat. pleasure. rest based listening one specific professor immunology called Pierre Capel Holland. discusses mutating virus (in Dutch): thing wait see unfortunately Sorry everyone WV. Everytime read headline WV never positive. find work around order. changed nothing, found loop hole agreed close it. fucking joke. Wait according lt governor Texas happy sacrifice grandmas economy.../sarcasm think reading passage bit off. saying anything US Constitution say federal government left states. state issues order, completely irrelevant federal Constitution. think people claim something unconstitutional, they're generally referring US Constitution, screeching constitutional rights even considered whether something violates state's Constitution. cases sky rocket there’s vaccine, things go back normal vaccine late then? Like...... vaccine fix everything make go away keep letting numbers go up? even read article? multiple studies showing masks don’t decrease number infected cases. one single study showing masks help stop spread Bc virus small passes masks respirators. harm good can’t normal oxygen amounts require leading issues. Read speak like dumbass parties mean 3-5 people, even use bathroom, sure, maybe. people spraying disinfectant use, fan on, door left open low risk.

Remember, too, there's minimum amount needed infection. Maybe little bit virus gets that, doubt enough infect anyone. 

One reasons people went stir crazy disregarding every precaution went far - see loved ones, safely possible. can't expect people stay 100% isolated next year more. Probably far simpler answer want, always starts ""the act"". 


The willpower act everything. try something, fails, try something else find right way surmount problem. alternative remaining incapable acting efficiently flexibly emergency like this. American style lockdown could work assuming followed conclusion. Look NY IL understand correctly, police union really union? call that, they're lobby. Unions much negotiate sector's companies warrant worker rights, sometimes involves pushing legislation order force companies, requires organising strike. always get something employers employees. US police union gets things police (the employer) police officers (the employees) government. 
I police union country great, makes sure police officers swamped work, get paid enough put dangerous situations without proper equipment, personnel training. think problem education, union formed people who've gone years training experts deescalation request military grade equipment try excuse cover colleague's misconduct, would push better training order prevent said misconduct future. Seriously it’s total joke. I’m lucky healthcare employee get tested faster general public, even requires hoops jump certain qualifications order get tested hospital. yes average turnaround tests seems least week, that’s finding place test WITHIN week. Trump defunding many testing sites, many Texas numbers increasing, beyond comprehension. shows layers ""managers"" *real* work.  makes sick every time read it.
Having think go doctor, balancig feel bad enough. ever paid hospital 10€ ... parking. acting like shit ton kids dying? Yes Indians would rolling money Rahul PM Duh... economy China obviously important to...China. Therefore stringent methods ones used China try contain tell something. Downvote want I'm inherently anti mask important make proper inferences causality much stake

Or could wear mask Companies close bunch floors save tonne.

Company work leases four floors outside DC, amount money could saved bonkers highly confused Ponzi scheme is. keep doomsday talk Nostradamus, you’re much smarter everyone else  yesterday Florida's positivity rate _(overall tests)_ hair 15 percent. That's increase 318 percent last 4 weeks 7 day trailing average. Reddit praises dude put together complete sentence. here, 1st July, 15% office return work want to, booking table mandatory. last couple months people required return rotation, 15-20%. cat loved sleep thick blanket. would worry cloth coverings bad cat would died long time ago. almost die blanket though, someone almost sat him. sweet make best decisions. Yep. number positive test results increased 50,567 5/24 109,014 6/24.

But course number tests increased 820K 1560K period.

The Florida positive rate getting worse (one 11 states), several factors increase number cases. Lots tests mean lots positives. ""Billionaire good"".

Which buy someone tells think.

You're invested government tells think actually parrot beliefs others, level mind malleable. Spitting hydro zinc purely profitable. Sounds like Enron explain fact unionized country better quality life? One 2 political parties death cult. right places specifically passed laws require mask wearing, large number places legally required wear mask, pain penalty. generally result emergency public health orders, issued governors, mayors, public health boards authority already granted emergency response laws. example, live, refusing wear mask outdoors public punishable $300 fine. 

While know final decision time, generally speaking, courts deferential governments trying address genuine public health crisis means rational basis. ATT owns labor union. union works paid scam. actually helped ATT fire people black. Also tesla cars safest world huge margin. Like required win people over, genuinely prioritize saving lives That's one narrative. FOLLOWED CDC GUIDELINES INSTRUCTED move back care facilities make room covid patients hospitals.

This always talking point critics--have actually researched beyond FOX headline? Oh yeah, he's also pro-choice baby killer. horrible man. Blah blah blah. Yeah, understand necessary. I've heard awful stories. I'd still anxiously awaiting swab brain. “Why didn’t anyone tell us real”

“I did”

“Not sissy” understand hate doomsday person. Nope, that's statistics deceased based data reported date Public Health Agency, differences regional reporting. **Statistics show number people confirmed covid-19 died, regardless cause death.** 

 sure right place this, I'm considering going IRL date someone already recovered COVID antibodies - I'm curious hear opinions/ideas go that?

For context, met online recently, went couple Zoom ""dates"" him, seems promising. He's told mild case COVID back early March. also told since he's tested consistently negative every 2 weeks, tested positive antibodies, medical team given cautious ""thumbs-up"" resume normal life (in CA/Bay Area matters).

For IRL date, gotta say, sounds Ike safest option possible, can't/don't want let guard, given super definitive studies people recover. going ask see test results. thoughts advice would appreciated. Thanks! Exactly. decided online school year. It’s going hit financially won’t able work, didn’t want part mess schools be. Millions people going debt likely losing homes possessions defaulting loans also good thing. Personally think way worse thing. That's said successful make way top. I'm sure many great people WHO, however efforts could prevent for. I, that's going, it? That's correct one sentence description, yes. lot complicated:

* Even otherwise reliable people like Fauci engaged somewhat disinformation campaign suppress demand medical masks.

* think ""it's protect others"" messaging kinda backfired. they'd instead focused whatever marginal protection homemade mask might offer wearer might motivated people more. think lot government officials media entities reluctant say offer wearer *any* protection liability concerns.

* Trump variable lesser extent every conservative narcissist who'll take personally anything even inadvertently draws attention failures. Good sticking guns, still incorrect assessment. ""simply false"" analysis clearly 60% way daily infections low enough traceable, guess.  really wanted improve Sweden’s image internationally, maybe start campaign keep defensive Swedes social media. Wrong. US citizens dont care bodycount. That’s economy bad we’re running burrito coverings Lol yup well fix soon enough, dying I'd take it, look, tear pieces, toss outside trash can. doubt real card mask intolerance. mask exemptions, mask requirements. misreading this. fucked thing cough stays overdrive months sick, likely actually covid February, insane cough technically result covid, infected anymore. Perhaps time look studies reports concerning effectiveness high doses vitamin D.  Elon Musk seems like swell guy. canada guy recently say ""I dont mind masks sanitizer, reason shut everything 3 months"". Defnitely Cassandra's. Uhm could surely tell contact past seven days.

The problem contact tracing labor intensive do. think contact tracing works western countries? Edited Titles

Actually, un-edited title:
""GENERAL ASSEMBLY NORTH CAROLINA SESSION 2019

Prepare november that's time Flu comes, another extremely dangerous virus.

Here problem. obviously tongue cheek downplaying COVID jab since he's ""afraid."" seriously thought flu dangerous would treating COVID differently talking shit people want remain home. can't play sides. Thanks! I’m considering pulling money tho Greenways? Parks, hiking trails, sidewalks? Badass like get political. I'm paying Union get benefits employer uses money contribute politician hate, that's cool. dual citizenship Germany. I'm trying get quickly possible. like vaccines, realize much done worked well past. “Rogue state”

Yeah apologize world governmentz! 2020 gift keeps giving. Good you, I'm happy you. Please insinuate ""love"" things go wrong. form personal attack. event like Darwin grand slam. finally decided pay union... retirement pension plan, seems important fund office negotiator Super-spreading property event infected person. become super-spreader infected showing event close contact many others. necessarily special property infection. well read, you? Vote idiot.
That teach lesson, said. going US shitty job protections place going hurt. Parents going pick homeschooling working lose jobs. working home, minute child’s daycare reopened, forced put back in, even though I’m home day. Basically, got line aren’t paying babysit dime. know federal jobs area way, even going far “office” inspections boss comes house make sure kids there.   
It's like American psyche going without mask become virtue show stronger virus unafraid wear masks ""losers"". invited friend's birthday party tomorrow. flying back Florida Midwest caring elderly relative. party 15 attendees get back plane return Midwest resume caring relative. bad feeling this. Yes, retail workers expect enforce getting physically assaulted, nation wide. 

If customer want enforce socially, guest. Dont pawn retail workers. McCain still around Obama taking response pandemic currently taken would definitely side someone like McCain even Romney sensible response pandemic.

I'm glad brain.

Unfortunately, people like parts rare come nowadays. Home doesn’t mean couch potato. people posting incredible projects done quarantine. Patios. Kitchen remodels. Planted gardens. People actually time get things normally would never time for. true Boston, DC, NY right now. would say that? basing mean he’s selling hundreds thousands full ev cars, don’t quite think it’s fraud. girlfriend's mother dead set flying home August see parents (**WHO ALMOST 90**)

I keep trying get talk mom it, I'm worried. went last year, fun. love family.

Which would really *really* like still around next year vaccine safely go again. many Americans going die people open eyes? possible reach dystopian, decimated population levels deaths U.S. without proper action? Back old days well lots kids (that lived). forgot: Greed, Cruelty, Selfishness, Corruption, Deception. Well... billionaire .... People dont accumulate much wealth nice people. simply false. tremendous amount evidence, including Tegnell Giesecke outright saying herd immunity strategy strategy officials stopped using phrase publicly negative connotations. anyone curious, please read links post above. literally see Giesecke outright saying herd immunity strategy, read Tegnell's words it. America also schools events shutdown, social distancing really exist Asia sense West knows it. issue method contact tracing nobody realistically remember contact with, rendering little use. Sounds like someone shoulda laid avocado toast put savings! People need stay home should, people get sick recover go get shit done.

An economic collapse cause far problems including death, virus. /r/readadifferentbook  They’re used seeing unwashed masses unimportant expendable. Like ants. millions us. What’s couple hundred thousand least important people? 

But yeah. lazier response, longer hurts economy. regard isnt greedy treat people coronavirus? sounds like actually want cull population. Also people won’t wear masks voluntarily. Lol course downvoted sub. joke Reddit become. Completely detached reality. :/ move another city COVID hit people starting go lock left voluntarily didn’t qualify. seriously still this? Hilarious. Get life, go stare wall something. Go away. red blue guilty. Personally I'm tired 1% dictating lives. importing lot PPE China, ramped PPE production. anything else there. compare flu fucking moron, though symptoms pretty similar. knew? even read OP posted?

If would see specifically addressed. bigger agenda here? sure. #HARRISON FORD HERE!!! Older 100 years can't imagine living place would consider that. Stay safe. I'd interested hearing elaborate ""everything led conclusion."" 

""Everything"" quite umbrella, I'm still trouble understanding viewpoint. 

You mention oceans one counterexamples, surely others. form accept universe place? probably thinks hurt Trump's feelings.

Suxh mind cultist. sincerely can’t tell that’s real not. people ones still parrot China warn us time. No, legit, didn't... states took forever start getting benefits people qualify left lot people dire straights. no. People die time, I'd rather die actually something couch potato. Yep That's asia pulling it. articles happening people died result inappropriately told stay home seriously ill COVID. type policy would also help reduce [severe strain ICU can't overburden healthcare system tell people stay home seek appropriate care all. ✔️ Vincent, Rich, Brianne discuss study estimating fraction symptoms severe disease SARS- CoV-2 infection, cellular immune responses without seroconversion interfamilial infections, answer listener email.

Propping profits shareholders holy stock market short term always priority. people like niece making clothing store part time retail job. like ""I get stay home make more? haha sure"". exited already last dip, took profits ran. thing I'm buying PMs bullshit? seems like reasonable way without massive privacy issues.

Embrace home. case Always exception. indication immunity begins fading two months *their I'm pretty sure Blade Scud figured back 2002. could resist? initially concerned USA would share vaccine countries. 
Trump reported say vaccines would go countries Americans vaccinated.

After reading article OK that. Cancel culture, thats title question, save read. answer usually probably not. Vote...for anyone else...even Groot would better he's tree! guys feel flying? HEPA seems clear aerosols, turned taxiing. risk? Cases mean anything resulting proportional amount hospitalizations deaths. open much hospital systems bear. Indian can't afford staying home. Nobody even GAF gender really. It’s narcissistic symphony. baby shower isn’t enough? Come on!

But yeah, also agree 100% w implications wrote. Gender reveal parties extremely regressive. part reason won’t woman president least 2036 teenage boys continue shooting schools learn part “real man” includes healthy expression emotions.  LOL paying attention ""leadership"" white house past 4 years?

This surprising all. Also, unlikely go 4 years without kind crisis knew incompetent orange blob would ""lead"" US sort issue.

I think non-Americans knew US would one worst coronavirus results world even happened. Well, turns out, can't gaslight virus. many rental properties own? commercial, residential, mix both? ""Don't put yer masks freedoms."" Yeah could look death counts places wear masks, places do. matter time. people think they’d stay home never get infected? guy ability what's right citizens. cares makes reelection numbers look bad. ""If arent testing numbers get worse, slow testing"". So...if state's voluntarily, we'll stop helping pay see make stop testing way. 

So fucked. International ban travelers EU country likely last next year. want shitshow. Don’t it. One thing I’ve learned thing it’s unpredictable. Happy Cake Day! Wow , actually closer herd immunity everyone else. Sweden could learn thing two /s Wait. What? Casinos open??? left would cancel Play stupid games, win stupid prizes. Dude article people spreading virus loved ones don’t live with, en masse. Sure still learning. (and rest world) still miles miles ahead America getting ahead quickly. states clueless. Sad pathetic situation. Devil’s Advocate here:
Is really surprising citizens mindset state blasé Covid? 

My state completely closed yet friends Texas we’re still going dinners stuff nothing shut down.

My state still shut yet Texas opened everything again, one friends went dinner boyfriend another couple. couple ended sick friend waiting test results. done concerted quarantine months (with stimulus), SLOWLY opened intelligently (essential work, small groups, etc), could managing thing well right now.

But we'd say overreacted. Would give double doot 18 115 830 tests conducted (+311 875).

32% new confirmed cases asymptomatic moment test. feeling way. Three girlfriends invited get together last week one houses, saying going social distance hang outdoors, back patio (I later learned eventually ended indoors, gathered around kitchen table). stuck guns declined invitation, even though felt kind ridiculous exaggerated. days later, reached another friend see holding up. told he's staying isolated continue visiting aging parents, friends decided get together lunch one houses (my friend declined), several days later, learns one guy group ended testing positive rest also sick waiting results. enough feel completely justified ridiculous exaggerated seeing friends.

At beginning pandemic, read quote influenced behavior ever since. I'm probably paraphrasing, went something like ""During pandemic, precautions taken seem excessive. pandemic, precautions seem inadequate.""

The risk very, real. crazy right thing family. Stick guns stay safe! you’re worried don’t go Halloween parties bud problem solved. 

Other mind business maybe? Ground zero almost herd immunity.  locked hard Spain, week late. 80-90% mask-wearing start, voluntarily. still took weeks see numbers stop increasing daily. feel guys, can't see anything human tragedy immediate future. Please wear masks. like country shitty half assed lock down. get huge economic harm get lots virus still. Great job!

Maybe either research vote 5 minutes, dont vote next time (if voted orange goon) It’s deceptive use week numbering system? Lol. think chose days include weeks? outside wearing masks inside none God, that's fucking terrifying. try rag hard either side political spectrum, obvious painful example insanely difficult handle nationwide challenge huge percentage nation ridiculous cult blindly follows one guy, guy unfortunately absolute fucking idiot. really serious problem US, going able stand anything we're state.  Here's difference though, Spanish flu came war hundreds thousands close proximity.

Covid came shut entire planet first time human history, would easily close Moscow (216k cases, 142k recovered, 3609 deaths, ~1k new cases daily, ~2k new recoveries daily) though, lockdown effectively ended. Covid regions it’s hardly big threat Moscow. 

With still think even open-air parade stupidity it’s likely lead kind second wave. mandate starts tomorrow five. start fining businesses serve without masks. That's right, excess deaths per capita tell truth eventually. wear masks we’ll hit number November 1? don’t need qualifications post reddit.

Personally think looking single factor like masks seems simplified. simply saying various factors coukd play risky you, speak risky barber either. concerned, Canada salons give surgical masks patrons, maybe ask provide one - protects staff better too. you, matters barber wears wear. 

I think someone else mention eye protection, would say worry much, eyes air intake like nose mouth cannot inhale viruses, worried keep eyes closed time. Take care. understanding community signaling important logic large parts US.

Doing anything different risks ""town weirdo"" become town weirdo everybody treat like shit run out.

Being little town nobody cares style community gives people cloak immunity whatever bullshit people on, weirdos follow outsider advice (including government advice) threat that. LOL covid laying bare people irredeemably stupid selfish.  Blame president every time. Tweet him, tell news outlets, 100% fault. Everyone believes it’s hoax don’t need wear masks following presidents lead. acted like leader set proper example actually showed compassion might avoided. Again, blame president every time story like comes around. Let people know man charge lying trying kill you, cares attention hamburgers. barely teens...of course girls age want kids yet...most girls knew kids mid 20s unexpected teen pregnancies. wife saying *is* conscious, communicating eyes -- he's incredibly weak. day, reported asked move jaw, did. reason suggest lying? would lie this? states front-loaded infections deaths could reach partial herd immunity victory lap fake-quarantine vacationing residents pretend like putting restrictions dirty south, definitely vacation CT. Orange man like Borg tbh. Well said! cant second wave stop first one...there hasnt been. moving around due places got first time yet. 

All anti mask stuff dont help. saw video guy took room air meter stuffed behind mask went said masks bad said there's less o2 behind mask air. didnt account simple logic inhale draw fresh o2 mask even though may detectable residual increased co2 behind mask, think it, negligible compared lung volume. I'm even medical field...im using common sense thinking it. video got half million hits Facebook. he's using ""osha approved room air meter"" mean science good. linkedin.com may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage, post automatically removed. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

LOL love reddit much fun watching people spout BS day long. assume ""2020 population adjusted"" means past pandemic figures would look fatality rates applied current world population? ""There new cases April"" Elon musk weird one country figures thing right, countries copy them. instead let epidemic go nuts. would people even go guarantee they'll find shelter employment anywhere else?

why would people stay place guarantee they'll afford shelter employment? asking would go - ANYWHERE job prospects Florida. I'd rather destitude state freeze death put Florida's politics total lack safety net. 

Staying apocalyptic money jobs. people leave places nothing offer, would rather place might jobs place know jobs? didn't, went it. excess deaths percentage increase best metric either. It'll excess deaths per capita. country typically low death rate, covid deaths would make look like worst performing. blm protests UK rates still plummeted. way body responds illness absolutely zero attitude mental strength moral fiber, etc.

This simply true... wrong. Attitude mental state play *huge* role recovery. competent medical professional tell this. What's hilarious half *those* screech half ""always plays victim"" Same.. think we’ve appointments normal.

I think intent destroy already. went twice fast. would access unemployment, government assistance, etc. 

And someone says “they still get unemployment right now”:

1. they’re still employed employer industry that’s allowed go back work;

2. People *still* trouble filing receiving unemployment assistance last ten years spent ravaging unemployment networks many states make difficult possible;

3. doesn’t take consideration needs like healthcare. someone family *severe* risk COVID-19 basically forced continue work high-exposure environment depend job health insurance. quit, they’d immediately faced $3000 monthly bill medications—not mention would happen got COVID unemployed. Even fuck ups. Don’t think wearing masks public prevent transmissions surprise birthday parties gonna force us viral hell, nothing lose point. I'm gonna go protest. encourage people form little communities protect evictions. almost way amass wealth 100 million dollars. Wasnt 90% yesterday? Thought somebody said still week fill I'd take 10 deaths hospital construction ends saving 100 lives potentially..

And logic 10 less 100. yet discussing p olitics sub gets comment deleted Auto-Mod. point discussion subject clearly influenced situation get deleted? Got bone pick moderation here, namely regard political comments. [This comment section suggests Gov. Abbot’s handling virus seriously considered nothing gets removed unless specifically use certain key word (hint: one two major American parties), point automod kicks in. would appreciate one 60 mods would actually take minutes browse threads remove stuff like this. highest prevalence I‘ve heard far. percentage asymptotic insane, thought it‘s around 50 % so. Hey, got alcohol well. Needed diazepam get it. Good luck!   Oh he's talking. He's talking alright. Yep, real issue. disgusting $$ lives two articles misleading headlines think talking about. One virus mutating China spread faster. one probably referring one Italian doctor making claim deadly anymore nothing back up. People read headlines bother article. wonder there's much pedantic, every Edeka Kaufland ever went standing. maybe that's East thing. sanction us point keep infections manageable level treat people effectively menu drug choices death rate remained fairly low. surge, forced triage prioritize patients lot deaths result. nothing, Trump fix social security... still look *both* ways crossing one-way street. You’re calling racist correctly, according definition provided, saying incompetent government thing genocidal government. Isn’t racist try take term could reserved atrocities like what’s going Myanmar equating stupidity short sightedness.

Or hate poor stateless Muslims? How? quit don’t get unemployment (which problems). sets protests awful idea. gonna hate one, gotta hate both. Nah, love America far much alliance US basically shaped country since 70yrs+. wait Americans recover psychosis.

If need nukes suppose, actually dont want have. reported accurate statistic, receipts, elderly impacted virus. 

The infection rate, demographics infection inferior gauge demographic impact illness. Hospitalizations mortality superior indicators. Florida done re-categorize cause illness death make numbers seem bad. tell unexplained increase reporting pneumonia unknown cause. national numbers better use numbers Florida . Ya think? No, guys saying hospitalizations result testing covid...not hospitalizing part medical test. 1918, now.

Also, there's whole plant animal kingdom deserve get roasted alongside humans. Many countries monitor flu outbreaks vaccine that. flu got control, vaccine work, countries would lock too.  Found yesterday meeting company time planning even starting bring everyone back office probably Christmas earliest. two months skeleton team might rotate back bit while. called hyperbole. fucking stupid?  many accounts running anyways? Lady science s-she bucks pretty hard I'm told Abbot breaking point. Hes preparing give virus stern talking to. Florida says hello Literally every media outlet reporting this. Even conservative-leaning non-paywalled Hill reporting discernible spike BLM protests. pointed endlessly, protests marches OUTSIDE vast majority wore masks. factors known minimize risk infection. It’s changing “physical distancing” (at least live) clarify meaning folks. work? Nah. I'm well aware states constitutions refer comment. change 10th amendment US Constitution irrelevant people crying constitutional rights referring state's Constitution. leadership easier apologize preemptive.

If prepare need extra capacity politicians crucified taking away freedoms reacting. However react say good job react problem. I’m nyc we’re fucked. Late 20/early 21 expect mass small business closing. even July big hurdle PPP ending. Thanks, looks like even though quite crisis yet definitely incoming. Wiping butt adequately According them, masks sent devil make us live fear dying, true Christian wouldn’t afraid getting sick dying know they’ll go heaven. 

If God protect coronavirus, also protect criminals need assault weapons. Yikes that's pretty shifty elon  thing wanted do: act consistently. banned NY okay banned everything. He's banning states high COVID numbers. Okay ban know. 120,000 people die Corona. With? Yes. From? No. pretty much everywhere like this.

they say whatever arnt going turn away $$$

our lives concern them. Thots prayers. Quote \*the get boner downvote posts disagree with?

I would like add brought conversation thread.

I consider little disingenuous accuse thread jacking one initiated.

I understand fascination downvoting business. surprised much fixated mentioned it. Maybe little close truth?

In case, read report source linked originally. one prime minister references interview. continues conclude due shortage masks, safest option basically one chose.

Hopefully better access masks future need lock containment.

Good stuff. Hope Sweden run masks.

edit: word ...and catch dead body. 


Clearly he’s familiar rest phrase. Probably short term too, depending define it. wanted leave room fact that, example, barber, giving 8 haircuts one day (because lockdown) advantageous economically giving haircuts day (because lockdown prohibits it). I'm sure what's data published April appears different now, TMC's data published today actually shows Covid ICU occupancy doubling since early April: this, two employees trouble many? likely Tesla needed excuse get rid trash. antibody test negative think assume negative, antibody test highly sensitive rates false negatives low. Even guys seeing positive, rate infection spouses 30% risk boyfriend/girlfriend (who presume living together) probably fraction that, take look data Table 3  interested. little late, beds full number cases surging. fucking matter they're full. Thinking surge replaced second wave phrase describe increased cases. behaviors seem inborn people. One instinct toward short term rewards, children must trained hold back long term rewards. Another concerned loss vs gain. Another curiosity. 

One related posting instinct self identify things ideas. Knocking belief becomes attack person. saw videos concert also wondering hell people thinking. helping screw chance college football season year. I’m native moved many moons ago. ""America"" land free. Free horrible employer, free treat others like shit.... Yup, actually ordered one. seem dismissive this, watching Today show morning (not pinnacle news coverage), said 3 10 ICU COVID. normal % capacity TMC ICU? think care, rather they'd eat spin zone ""The Dems/China/Hillary's Emails nuked us"" starting believe that, owing revolutionary history United States, state-federal relations, states came (part Union), capable ""national unity"" way countries like Canada capable of.

If Americans realistic (especially Americans living South like FL, TX, AZ), seen northeast (NY, NJ, CT, MA) taken warning bad could get, practiced social distancing locked strictly way Italy did, would strictly adhered clean living way Japan Taiwan did.

The 4 dangerous words, financial markets healthcare (especially infectious diseases) **this time different**. see, bubble blown March 23 stock bond markets based ""the worst over, back Q4 2019 now!"" People bidding stocks bankrupt companies like Hertz causing stock go 10X 2 weeks. JP Morgan Chase 30 year bonds issued March 19 went 48% market value (the Federal Reserve buying zero rates absolutely caused this, bond prices go rates go down). Meanwhile, pandemic response Deep South ""the worst over, let's reopen quickly could without caring consequences"". Now, result hasty reopening resurgence cases.

There probably 50 000 daily new cases end month, 100 000 daily new cases September. second wave comes, would 200 000+ cases per day thousands new deaths. go 1918 Spanish Flu levels. Um... way cases? less cases April would problem. Literally every state cases skyrocketing saying seeing less sick patients less requiring ICU. live w grandparents everyone point wish comes I’m fucking terrified spread us vice versa it’s literally fear constantly get. I'm still hearing ""muh freedom"" ""the testing unreliable"" fb. excruciating listening people. First lot people said there's going spikes. spikes happening, think conspiracy - positive results ""faked"" get people wear masks. I'm sure there's another conspiracy du jour hospitalizations surge energy wade anymore  agree, although Panama Belize could close seconds. Lol bill gates rich af great deal help mom. Jeff bezos one sorta started yall weird Oof

Thoughts prayers?? agree. they’re going kill economy well. Even 50% population healthy foolish enough keep shopping dining support economy. Texas pretty much doomed. treatment Covid, fair comparison would AIDS treatment. far worse Covid.  Right, within ventilation systems danger light hitting human cells, broader spectrum radiation problem. air passes ventilation system every 8 minutes, effect same. Air currents might great though. feel ladies pimps gonna get worse dumb states shut back down. North Carolina, Kentucky, Virginia 

All three governors party. forgot one certain country Sweden liberal left-wing dystopia world part EU absolutely worst job coronavirus fight save economy. leftie plebbitors seem ignore this. Fuck billionaires yes includes musk difference pro-Trump riots would justified. label way want whatever reason want, excess mortality numbers lie. Like mass-casualty events famines wars/genocides, pandemics primary fatalities (those dying illness itself) secondary fatalities (those preventably died pandemic). included excess mortality numbers, numbers tell whole story. so? anti pollution masks work covid-19, i'm bike useful wear public transport shops? liar? source ""couple million"" concede pulled number ass move goalposts dude apologist?  I'd shocked manufacturing company right thing. know company stuff Tesla I've heard similar things people working large manufacturing companies Graduation (an extreme amount kids caught it)

Do something back claim with? extreme amount news me. That's puts really large portion US high-risk category. Forget weeks MONTHS possibly YEARS ups downs numbers. Huge swings. People need prepare reality likelihood ineffective unsafe vaccine due rushed trials. Det er fordi er en samling blinde idioter der er ligeglade med menneskeliv. :( still can't believe people think political statement shun masks! Woooooosh April NYC around 20% NY state 14%....in April. Meaning people antibodies sick March earlier.  drive around area looking yard signs cherish hope. fucking assholes would elect Hitler propped corpse slapped R next name. talked Covid nurse Austin (where live) Abbot saying hospitals still plenty ICU rooms Monday ICU full major Austin hospital.

They've decided fine ignore virus bad enough go panic mode. Yeah empty chair White House.

Scanners detect intelligent life left website. title specifies worst day *of pandemic*, literally refers spread disease. It’s 2 people they’re probably disgruntled employees lying article points. Read fucking article idiots go full trash panda. Good news likely won’t die. Bad news teachers, parents, grandparents might. way Abbott least end July. timing allow maximum ineffectiveness students schools react. It’ll announced last minute school districts can’t plan it, meaning students expect entire wasted year education instead 2 months March-May earlier year. Every country manipulating numbers. saturday year too. hope right means done faster. Plus may get consolation prize survive E.R. visit, go home w/ Covid-19 get free ticket back 2-3 weeks, also plenty 'tickets' share w/ everybody know love. Infected today, deaths happen generally 12 23. Older people die earlier, younger people die later. Check death counts three weeks. I've similar experience person know. literally kind person research study about. can't possibly believe damn libtards right, fox News garbage propaganda Wait yesterday?!? Keep listening Reddit phds What's opinion pocket variety? proud Californian right now. citizens allowed use data, challenge it, analyze it. helps scientists across world. releasing data virus studied countries may transparent. one ethical things I’ve seen politics lately. amount data put world one step closer ending damn virus. I’m K-town area last like... 2-3 weeks I’ve seen pretty universally people wearing masks keeping distant taking things pretty seriously. It’s dropping though, think I’m large part it’s things reopening people getting lax.  assume restrictions put place driving followed would fewer deaths. regardless, driving positive, almost requisite part culture now. COVID positive benefit, hopefully doesn’t become part culture. 

Would prefer risk anyone’s life drive? Yes, absolutely. meant fewer people driving requirement? Cool, like idea. Fewer deaths = yay, period. 

But you’re talking stopping spread something negative like COVID community stop it. 

I mean, want look purely terms cost human life, theoretically everyone could still drive zero loss life result. It’s happens, it’s possible. 

That’s case COVID. isn’t even theoretically possible everyone survive contracts it.

If you’re concerned cost life transportation deaths COVID number deaths higher, I’m fine that. want promote safer driving, means so!

But don’t say “Driving kills people COVID don’t need worry COVID much do.” Please don’t say that. anything, say worrying driving do. 

So let’s worry driving do, let’s wear masks it. Nah, he'd actually get something done. Well district it’s Karen’s want go Target get nails done without dealing kids. course entitled people refuse wear mask too. True, include CDC Surgeon General telling us ""masks work"" critical beginnings pandemic. ICU rooms set ventilator support

what? said that? funny right sudden admires Sweden hahahaha

It's funny rest us left suddenly shut sanctity free open borders. viruses spread protesting. Especially factor people obese normally one co-mortalities Yep. sums potential deaths (unless vaccine released distributed time) impact significant hit economy big. Add changes people’s behaviours stay home real fear opposed government mandated lockdowns, interruptions business employees stay home sick hospitalized.... It’s shit situation matter look it. Shocking. listened video, ah see average rates 70–80%. Good looking out.  I’m Dallas, Texas handful autoimmune diseases asthma along health concerns. partner supportive working home still go doctor appointments infusions. 

Fuck me. I’m scared. I’ll give one guess called them. Wow. second this.. What. The. Fuck. Idk another subreddit covid one comments deleted saying “fuck America”, I’m erring side caution Lots idiots think CNN unbiased well. biased news sources. Walmart recently discovered owned richest family world?! (Combined wealth) wonder they're profitable?...  details facts there. everyone pay minutia everytime give interview.

But, importantly, nobody paying attention details, even shit show arguement. What's even point anymore? seen evidence china manipulating numbers? Everything I've seen speculation: ""of course lied, China!""

Like, ok, fair, I've seen pretty much everything right. I've shocked lack people's critical thinking abilities.

People can't seem reconsider opinions, even face overwhelming evidence. Italy shut things getting bad. can't stop economy indefinitely. Businesses closing, people unable pay rent afford necessities. economy must go on. government can't print money hand masses without work involved. enough deaths warrant major economic depression would occur everything stayed closed. D3 Bathroom isn’t usually problem. Surfaces haven’t big problem this. problem people talk loudly bars bars densely packed. talk loud, expel lot air might also need take deeper breaths. decision value reward empathy selflessness. Guess you’re first line go. think would saved valued? University Houston say thats plan well. That's school go to. One classes 500 people... maybe thins herd enough matter come election day, collateral damage look good regardless bad NBA. January long gone, what's explanation highest numbers now, rest world doesn't?

Are still blaming China? got post reply, started reading thinking spam first... Johnny's voice started reading head hit first ""*God's gonna cut 'em down*"".

Idk people voting lol facts 🤷🏼‍♂️ Almost there. Even US new cases tomorrow, time bring death count pass Italy level.

Would mind sharing data sources? journal studies I’ve following show IFR ranging approximately 0.2% 1%, substantially higher Influenza’s usual rate 0.1%. mention vaccine, known immunity previous strains, unlike seasonal flu people entire country catch right now.

Also unlike flu, hospital systems wide areas get overwhelmed - good luck getting treated quickly well severe concussion potential brain damage slip pool local ICU’s hit capacity people ventilators weeks, every trained respiratory nurse 8 patients instead 2.

I family Texas. Houston 97% full ICU’s rising. They’re usually 70-75%. Yes, add surge capacity maybe another 25% - doesn’t help much patients keep coming coming coming.

The CDC IFR even higher 0.63% 4.24 though March data. inevitably drop year two complete data.  says want hear

It's great go back onto post month old retroactively ride high n mighty smug twat win favours. 

As today, 25/06/2020, NZ 1,169 confirmed cases , 1,134 recovered cases 22 deaths. 

Every single death 1 death many belittle hard work everyone people health system bullshit. America. COVID area. Little Marco thinks opinions matter Yeah, could. We'd grumble bit, we'd it. We'd probably harder faster second time too, since we're eager done it. thought 15 case going up. going near zero. Please Wear Mask.

the virus defeated unity Especially researchers aren’t allowed ask patients participated demonstrations protests riots. Houston major spikes protests hasn’t 2 weeks though lot states started opening 1 month ago explanation mess someone went back many times try fix kept making worse. Sick people spread germs?  

No shit Sherlock. useful study. Now! It’s unenforceable horseshit. Probably illegal, maybe even unconstitutional. Cuomo gives fuck generating headlines making look good. so-called low death rate gets higher disease infectious one. 

Just look number deaths, pointed instead getting stuck death rate.  Number Deaths.  death rate important.  testing everyone, real death rate anyway.  everyone wants test even get one.  affect death rate.  matters ultimately bodies dropping ground - deaths.

More Americans died coronavirus world war one.  ""death rate"" per America greater tanks, mustard gas, machine guns, Spanish Flu World War one.  one getting excited transformation, assure you. Maybe demographics getting infected work favor ruling party. Since obviously intelligent thought isnt driving rhe decision process. economy thanks you. /s Lol mobile well noticed.

I’ve wondering much catastrophe direct result Kushner’s (awful) “advising”. excuse orange blob least bit, however. people point systemic racism sole reason Coronavirus affects PoC communities more.

They’re single issue activists. don’t look broader context, look 1 aspect 1 issue. Yes, desk/computer based offices need closed immediately. incorrect information. Trump never wanted full lockdown. Pelosi say matter. guarantee Trump wanted would lockdown. BUT, happened. Instead, great U.S.A. higher infection numbers country, population considered, face earth. accomplishment. European Union, heard afternoon, ban visitors vacation, visiting E.U. countries. Pretty soon, Americans unwelcome everywhere. achievement!! Now, current administration longer subsidize Covid testing centers. Wow, talking going BACKWARD. know blame laid disaster. It’s stimulus funeral homes. Yes, idea merit claim vaccine ready fall PR. trial 0 it.  100% commercial real estate. Fuck that. quit job couple weeks ago move one cool WFH without limits.

Also car, way park, good luck public transit.  realize something similar like dress code policy used unfairly force minorities spaces? People anti mask mentality see much misinformation bad decision making. example March CDC said wearing mask help could possibly put risk. example bad decision making money given nursing homes taking covid patients. They're paid bring covid buildings full vulnerable people. Hey least Brazil....am right fellow Americans? Thanks flattened curve. Re-opening preemptively might affect that. Deaths dropping steadily. likely actual cases numbers go increased testing. owned business wouldn’t let anyone weren’t wearing mask, wouldn’t care reason was, wouldn’t care hurt feelings, wouldn’t care thought discriminatory. Coronavirus doesn’t care, all. Universal masking would probably make huge difference, know, that's basically like living North Korea. 4/6/20 showing 43000? daily case counts hugely meaningful metric anyway; 14-day average much better Oh thinking thing. $20,000 would sitting pretty good long time honest pretty frugal rather low expenses. aren’t going lock again. guarantee FWIW, lot people said province overreacted beginning. 0 active cases two weeks. Singapore overreacted, South Korea overreacted, Taiwan overreacted, New Zealand overreacted. countries gave advice US, attempts mix messaging occured many countries, seems taken hold few. think erosion trust public institutions, regardless political affiliation current executive leadership factor continue be. Exactly. know many people flu get tested perfectly fine? That's use estimate CFR. would Covid want push agenda, course. Sounds like someone's last words  many opinions Saturday pretty much proved America doesn’t patience race war. riots already moving news cycle, electioneering sneaking back in, people calmly discussing death tolls action months ago would abominable.

I spent long time studying organizations always big problem telling difference malevolence incompetence - like person evil stupid - actively TRYING screw even know?

From studying event I’m beginning realize primary flaw X-Files franchise assumption people government idea whatsoever doing. said that???? Point mainstream media celebrating rioting.

It’s ideal me. mask thing simple way get us part way mess. see Facebook people actually trying show mask dangerous. it’s certain store I’m thinking about, makes complete sense customer base.

Plus trade embargoes good luck getting anything Nintendo awhile. girlfriend works big box retailer pools things backordered months due pandemic. tells people that, respond “but it’s summer!”

Yeah Rona ain’t gonna magically let go summer plans.

However, whole ""American Exceptionalism"" thing permeates pretty much every textbook, even taught directly directly. Americans absolutely believe ""special"" country citizenry innate superiority countries. 

This leads persistent belief America always right world affairs, nothing bad can/should happen us, smallest bad thing happen massive slight.

Government dependency problem. Why? Well simple. 

Anything given...can taken away. really want someone kind power?

I dont care much Trump Biden, im assuming anybody leans one way other.

Assume government office holder, gives government money lock house. become dependent.

Now say another government leader like. Sees opportunity extort people. (Yes already this...its face it)

How would feel then? 

But...guess require government dependency first place?

Because made way. Especially certain areas. unable to... Grow harvest food. (Some cases still limited). unable hunt/farm animals harvest. even unable collect rain water even personal consumption.

So do...for example Flint, Michigan...when government dependency fails you?

Thats dont want. cant honestly sit tell “the government failed handling covid-19” (dont dare stupid enough say Trump problem) also tell daddy government take care you. confirm. Live upstate. People gave masks grocery stores like 3 weeks ago approach everything always spin situation favorable personally matter spite reality.  

He things much say things loudly obnoxiously.  

He's handling exact way.  Loudly saying reality tells much different story. Man, wish could go back memory remember better thinking things head, without perspective present. Seems kinda impossible.

HERMANOS I'm sick hearing word 'unconstitutional' American's mouth. constitution likely killed tens thousands people last months. Why? already San Jose. Here's easy solution. Stop reading watching fox news mhm. let's use facts prove point. 
the population us 330 million. 
personally, think get hand, let's say half US population contracts covid-19. actually think people contract virus, we'll go now. 
165 million. 
165 x 0.2% = 330,000. 
That's 330,000 lives lost. that's US. 
If think US shut lives 1/3rd million people, delusional. I'm sorry, that's is. 
Oh btw, 0.2% mortality rate true. Currently 120,000 people died covid far US 2.4 million known infections. that's 5% far. Even still infections know about, US would around 60-70 million infected make 0.2% mortality rate reality. 
Please. 
Think family. 
Think yourself.

I’ve got really bad feeling this... wasn’t article Facebook post apparently doctors said likely catch virus bar drinking weakens immune system significantly enough incubation period would significantly faster. doctors said likely get bar (according post, I’m repeating read sharing opinion it). Well, liberal media are/were different recently Wow Trump right! don’t talk it, goes away. It’s miracle. Let’s celebrate going karaoke bar share drinks other! got eyes. That's Mitch Senate Leader, Lindsay old dude. lot easier businesses require customers wear mask it’s backed law.

Where live backed law. order governor. 30-40% people grocery store obeying law.

The law enforced. Trump part Norman Vincent Peale school magical thinking. joke sarcasm.  Well, technically earth's surface surface... Many businesses high enough limits make social distancing difficult unlikely.

A local store shop recently doubled capacity limit already hard walk peak times previous limit.

Move on! Nothing see here. hail great leader. I'm still convinced McConnell turtle suit. Bad bot Yes, Americans fall it. perfectly fits agenda tho. president made virus political issue. refuses admit severity pandemic concern economy. Wearing mask proves something Americans need protect from, thus followers (because cult point) refuse masks support him. 

The ironic part whole mess longer people refuse accept reality pandemic needs done get control (test, trace, isolate), economy continue worsen. imagine fast things would happened never shut schools closed non essential businesses...we would surely hospitals overwhelmed especially early days PPE shortage.

It disheartening done? Everyone can’t stay home work vaccine, state government simply can’t afford that. tough reality might reach level herd immunity vaccine. right answer smdh get theyre lot authoritarian comes enforcing lockdown china would country able large pop. dont see beyond dense megacities crawling virus, official media coverage within China? agree, good him. embarrassing leaders beg us something stupid. especially frustrating numbers skyrocketing rest world recovering. stings little. totally...a months back shifted rhetoric ""empowering"" states. responsible solution. undermines this? irresponsible.

How crazy would be... (A) dissect shit 2nd article. 50% stroke cohort younger 62 3500 patient study, previously 25% stroke sufferers age 65. Ergo massive increase younger patients COVID-19 comorbid stroke.

Here doctor... medical director, explaining fucking next thing post want topic younger ages shown strokes.

I've already demonstrated 50% stroke cohort least decade younger.

Admit wrong we'll continue.

A doctor, director stroke deparment one hardest hit COVID-19 areas U.S. knows awful lot do.

Now need find proof increased incidence stroke younger patients. Like people deluded really think can’t happen them. It’s crazy. They’re “shocked” just... laughable. Like feel bad elderly family members honesty probably going die younger people absolutely knew better, shame them. hope guilt stays rest lives. don’t live America, city live hasn’t started significant reopening; large protest weeks ago surge new cases cases tied protest. really seems like reopening causing majority new cases, outdoor demonstrations people diligent safety others.

Medical marijuana really. droplets go it’s aerosol comes in. masks wear don’t barricade aerosols much. would need hazmat suits that. we’re already 2/3 way there? actually doesn’t sound bad, originally saying “millions.” almost guarantee higher number date. I'm arguing lot people died from, dying from, continue die virus. virus obviously infectious back February. But, infectious disease 18% fatality rate kills people 5% fatality rate. COMPARISON could been, worst case scenario.

Also want talk sheer amount deaths, Spanish flu considerably less infectious killed 675,000 Americans US population third today. also predicted killed 100 million people worldwide. Many people (epidemiologists) thought could hit levels. 400,000 deaths lot. comparatively, pretty decent. predicting rise introversion?

See say shit like world populated, actually saying perfectly fine hundred thousand people country die life style continue unimpeded. heres funny thing bud, dipshits wore fucking masks could back enjoying summer. hey keep fucking easiest societal test ever thrown way. Still wearing mask, people try convince it’s necessary convinced become it’s political agenda.


There tipping point changes.

There one could convince otherwise.  get idiots swear up, down, left, right fatality rate 0.26% CDC used number (without citing source justify it) one model, even though NYC already fatality rate higher that. may well claim humans use 10% brain, equally BS claim.

They refuse admit CDC pulled number thin air political pressure. pulled thin air, would voted source it.

Correlation != Causation. unless source numbers protesters either state, assuming stats. contract tracers asking cases attended protests.

What anything? NY's positive test cases still ~1%. I'm sure cases transmission occurred protests, since they're outdoors protesters wearing masks statistically insignificant. 

There's something else going CA rest states, that's simply people going indoor, crowded places like bars gyms. I'm chemist (At poo plant) concur! It’s amazing anything doesn’t fit narrative pseudoscience. studies listed legitimate, don’t like results don’t demonstrate trying say. that’s different thing.

I’m SC. office open (no working home except special circumstances, even though job 100% doable home) since started. precautions put place management. I’ve keeping cubicle, washing hands, etc., there’s much do. 

Yesterday sent home get tested coworker tested positive. She’d coming work, walking around, talking everyone, awaiting test results didn’t bother tell anyone she’d even tested. Thankfully it’s nobody I’m ever close contact with, I’ve still building obviously. 

I got tested morning. Wasn’t nearly bad thought would be. temperature 99.1 I’d coffee 30 minutes feel fine otherwise I’m likely okay. Still self isolating results come (4-7 days) course. 

This frustrating. infected coworker could done job home, too. Management would worked her. don’t understand someone would public—especially office you’re close others indoors day—if know there’s possibility it. 

Be smart, everyone, guess I’m saying. It’s hard much sympathy folks first one especially. “Antibodies” never last forever body still stores information make antibody cells next time comes contact virus wild really think it. learned lot whole conversation.

More importantly, NFL isn’t fucking dumb, contingency plans contingency schedules keep pushing back season.

What I’ve heard get 6 games, season goes. Assuming change LITERALLY nothing postseason, long start season November 22, rest season.

And don’t think second vaccine available NFL isn’t paying way front, bridge sell Depends whether laws mandate companies work benefit shareholders.

Managers forced obey law rather personal preferences.

Being public company removes many options available private company. 6 complaints, 2 fired provably lying.

Notice 2 fired people claimed staying home, told press conditions plant bad. never went see themselves, lied.

What company fire someone like that? fair makes sense they’d personally would love better information proportions people, age characteristics, serious Covid symptoms not. It’s clear vast majority people flu-like symptoms worst. However, I’d really like see clearer numbers that. Super spreader refers person’s rate transmission, event. person super spreader events size. That's good recommandations! 

«One day discover asymptomatic people farts could give us natural immunity 🤪» ~2 weeks someone get sick, spike requires several cycles people getting sick infecting several others. think 7 weeks meant precise, approximate. Yeah got downvoted type comment lol, positives less hospitalizations testing pretty clear indication finding people had/have death rate probably lower initially thought. 0 days reality. Around parts people could still go shopping Target, Walmart, grocery stores, etc. really thing closed restaurants. That’s lock down. context good question? employee doesn’t get decide go back work. 

The way parents spot would find another babysitter would show up. 

You’re allowed go work. You’re allowed delusional audacious entire company wait feel comfortable working.

A job isn’t right. There’s real person paying performance. article Fauci saying White House told NIH cancel coronavirus research BS.  one reads articles anymore. even stated research Wuhan. 

Obama Administration giving millions grants Wuhan Virology Institute years.  level 4 lab thats miles Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market. lab thats experimenting gain function SARS. 

It wasn’t ago media spin made Trump funding type research. canceled it. Media spin saying canceling coronavirus research. No. canceled millions grants going Wuhan China.   Look users post history need know articles. outdated, machine translated, spam Sweden. Sorry user posts 10 articles Sweden EVERY day time, spam. Lmao Judging comments, one actually read article.

The headline makes sound like Elon Musk told everyone go home, sent everyone pink slips.

The article says *two people* terminated returning work HR attempted contact them, presumably ask they'd returning work. knows else went decision? Maybe already crappy employees.

Or maybe not. really think Elon Musk office saying, ""I want fire Bob Amanda scared Coronies, nyeehhahah."" Billionaire bad weh weh explain cynic says crisis intentionally mismanaged order give money friends, give money. supposed oversight, hasn’t gone well.

If give money everyone, you’re helping everyone. agree this. I’ve lucky enough stable job home. people starting demanding go back work surprised. realized everyone position, it’s go back work go bust, regardless pandemic.

That problem completely within control government. rent / mortgage pause, emergency funding people, could reduced burden average citizen. Instead got $600 / week bump unemployment benefits corporations walked away trillions. That's good point. I'd argue lot investors interested show world changing nature Tesla/Space X/Starlink pure profitability it. Basically like start loan vs guaranteed money maker. Investing complex, prob I'm still poor. nephew one unknowingly infected, thinking slight cough byproduct working construction.

What dickhead. Literally information spreading cough. cough write ""oh well, work construction"" invite family without telling anything. shitbird definitely new black sheep family. cant fucking STAND hear people say ""but MAH SPORTS!"" shit going on. -_- ICU already 70% full (of non-COVID patients) typical?  beaches really big problem too. They're packed one cares. Harris county mandatory mask order largely ignored people. I've MANY people argue tell I'm crazy. First hit search found them,

And yes, Sweden high excess mortality year vs. Denmark barely probably going show age expectancy. 

So disagree Sweden deaths Denmark tragedy? happens governor makes masks required public slow reopen. workers provided evidence continuing correspondence managers. believe received notifications speaking concerns working conditions plant.

Yet two people fired people claimed staying home, told press conditions factory bad. people staying home know factory like? people lied, terminated.

No one upset here, people wanted get fired playing bullshit. many politicians ran platform ""tough crime"" result basically kiss hiney local police department. problem appear overnight - decades police department basically running little government oversight, nobody political stomach fight back.

And again, Sweden this? 3 days it’s still active? Meanwhile mom live areas relatively calm canceled annual visit. I'm fucking heartbroken want flying, want around fly. Well, it’s surprise now! Ahahahahhaha fucking press briefing? Ok, sure. Come back year still nowhere site  cake next username, means anniversary date created account infected would still exposed again. we're going see 2nd time patients we'll likely see starting fall countries controlled outbreaks. 

&amp;#x200B;

The United States going serve test bed probably. live society. Also bear mind case count resolved outcome. Many infected people yet recovered died. takes 2-6 weeks resolve case, current infections future deaths, current number dead limited present.

A potential upper bound fatality would calculate % (deceased)/(recovered + deceased) rather (deceased)/(infected) also problems due time lag unrecorded cases (it works correctly tallied). Last month so, calculation US range 25-40% 1% New Zealand.

We also seem much handle many recovered patients still unwell (perhaps permanently), degree heart failure, post-viral syndrome, lung damage, etc.

There mentions online people ""recovered"" long time ago still can't function, even point struggling take shower wracked pain. people say affects elderly unhealthy ignoring unaware fact. Post-viral syndromes cripple young active healthy people life. best stay socially distant

And yet showed evidence telling ""lie"", you?

All trying stop posting articles, people reading them.

You contributed nothing all. corrections. arguments. Nothing. whining spam agendas. I've happen before, really sucks. know exactly much china fudge number? know manipulated puppet? China also much forced approach comes lockdown. could drastically slowed spread. could wrong definite evidence prove either us right wrong. glady accept evidence. common sense everyone's common sense. Resorting personal attack reasoning fail short exactly like Donald J Trump. interest wasting time talk you. mostly government's response. Nobody forcing anyone go governor actively fought masks. Lt Governor shamed people going out. state government made stink economy actively prosecuted county required masks. Abbott blaming Dallas county judge Clay Jenkins ""rounding people jailing wearing masks"", blatant lie. Nobody jailed mask compliance here, hell even really hand fines it. ""ordinance"" hardly enforced, made hard rule ordinance said can't stopped whatsoever. Abbott said punishments violation order said Dallas stop. Abbott praising cities ""figuring out"" require businesses require masks Abbott scolding Jenkins could done way. top that, Abbott aggressive reopening schedule impossible see effects fast enough hit threshold stopping, even we're threshold refusing anything. cluster fuck almost state government horrible response manipulating people get spend money. opinion, favor handling crisis...

You’re talking major infrastructure overhauls city planning changes get efficient public transportation routes

Most Americans don’t take public transit there’s efficient route get home job

And think you’re significantly stating gains environmental friendliness electric cars ICE engines doubt it. pretty much made clear less week ago schools fine August. even said wouldn’t make masks schools mandatory. teacher, horrifying.  quite frankly, year two need deploy regular vaccines boost immunity. saying wouldnt difficult hell worldwide scale, would possible. virus clearly hates us freedom. really seems like everyone needs walk get union, unfortunately they’ll starve people let happen saw couple articles two-three months back, looked convincing time images whatnot consistent silencing coverups often coming China related negative imagery. 

Their official death toll didn’t move weeks, despite health officials inside China screaming otherwise. google link, mobile user. 
The plumes crematoria ran 24 hours per day rather 4 traditionally allowed. Definitely visible imagery, possibly harder discern weather mapping. resign disgrace. absolutely excuse, especially big city mayers judges *tried* keep masks month ago shot last week! US too. Don’t know saw video people protesting Florida mandate masks? live Florida, deal with.

- Elon Musk first thought. TX partying months. share opinion people can
tell opinion opinion that’s works pro gamblers could really assess risk well like pretend do, wouldn’t pro gamblers. Stock market losses tax advantages relative gambling. NV locals know “pro gambler” euphemism “degenerate.” Hell, lot residents point. saying Musk personally terminated them?? target worked pretty great. Mostly due manager g Yeah. Probably idealized time longer exists. wild west best option undeveloped country. long time ago. guys bucking evolution dangerous point, playing cowboy.

Does family say stuff too? mine? know damn well grammy gave hugs. They’re going need shut delaying inevitable situation going get worse worse looked up: Cuomo stopped elective surgeries March 22nd, got 4000k daily cases, 10 days first 100 case day. NYC near 97% ICU utilization point.

My wife's hospital already prep mode early March, already ceasing elective cases convert ORs pop-up ICUs week official order Cuomo. far tell science showing easiest get airborne, yeah, CDC given whiplash year. masks, wait wear masks. people running state mad people run state, probably never public mask order. state weird cause one first reopened plan, really seen significant spikes (bars college students feel invincible) Heck netflix willing end watched orginal anamater breathed word union. least Tucca Birdy going AS. 


Now, im exactly pro union myself., fear super corps workers maybe power really telling. ""But would think people, unable think general???"" Yes, yes did. 

You see said comment people read articles made assumptions actual story summary is:

2 Tesla workers received termination notices even though told fine leave without pay covid-19. 

Are Tesla's practices odd unsafe? Yes, article telling safely assume so

Where employees able fix situation? One did, one refused unless call recorded. Understandably so, confirmed they've officially terminated since article told us played mistake actually contacted employees make agreement concession. also mentioned Tesla HR ""implied"" return work fix wanted keep jobs, end interpretation person question. saying lying unless official statement could misunderstanding.

Did Elon Musk personally terminated people participants thread assume so? No

So act smug it, give actual read yourself, actually read whole article stopping something fits agenda?

Because that's case different reading tittle

It's well known Elon makes tantrums like spoiled child, obviously flawed, point comments point flaw reddit skimming article actually reflect analyze what's written Yup, ordered couple said maybe August earliest. Don’t disagree recovery pre covid state going challenge. Still interesting question speed recovery though. theorise keeping healthy population means strong domestic demand, full workforce. Lockdown financial aids effectively spending stimulus. Healthy population accepted cross border travels earlier too. guess assess outcomes 2 extreme ends. could sooooooooooo much worse comparison valid European countries playing sports, I’m sure that’s going tbh. Well two let go reason, don’t think ploy make feel job safe giving time intent fire took it.

The communication matters contact managers HR. happens lot employees get new phone number give manager don’t update HR system, could reason HR terminating them. 

At end day, offered jobs back contacted HR, I’m sure it’s malicious first seems. ""Woody Allen news, huh? Well... He's think whole existence weird.""

-[Hannibal It’s summer. It’s hot everywhere protests part. 

And yes outdoors certainly proven far less dangerous previously believed. everyone lives US, sorry tell you. He’s hero lmao he’s certainly “unsullied”. literally said he’s flawed human, either can’t read can’t analyze someone else’s argument. seem one Reddit’s less “astute readers”

I respect man company eco-sustainable innovations. Don’t even Tesla products tbh. 

And yeah that’s point, you’re really gonna tear whole man’s career single tweet? People fuck up, people’s mistakes magnified ever social media. tweet hurts feelings much, don’t know snowflakes like react obstacles real life Hospital system Texas isnt NY either supposed buy Cybertruck Elon Tesla acting like bunch asshats? new behind police series fascinating.

It’s improbable take things account. Get fucking rekt. It’s culture war. No, see that's *needful* fear.

A needless fear afraid others driving drunk refuse drive anywhere even necessary so. surprise statement Abbott came shortly issued executive order designed free beds state’s four biggest counties postponing “all surgeries procedures note immediately medically necessary.” Yeah... company similar policy. beginning paid everyone stay home (March). opened stores, gave people option working extra pay, staying home reduced pay (April). gave option working regular pay staying home pay (May). Now, requiring everyone work risk termination (June). several people would respond calls telling needed report work, terminated. pushing fucking agenda lies

No, not. complaining posting Swedish language news articles, ""lies"".

Unless saying Swedish media lying, is. that's saying, focus article posted, person posted many, look Europe flair

So, want change telling people stop posting?

Here idea: find 'positive' articles would prefer see posted upload them, instead trying stop people uploading?

Make contribution own...

But that's really motivating you, it? kingdom heaven within understanding fraction employees always sell stock ASAP get pay cash (which again, would get unionizing). fraction hang onto it, hopes company grows, get total income. Data fractions is, course, hard come by. Philanthropy scam taxes jobs kids sorts bullshit Huh, can't share opinion now? Yeah Bolivian friends explained me. Morales popular basically changed constitution run bunch fucked shit lost support. Texan (Austin) really mean much. much open places open clearly following rules, people wearing masks meaningful manner. I'd like say decision help, reality going much, anything all. think businesses allowing people without masks make major impact. Moreso people threatened fines. judge son sins father, view elon's personal life favorably mean need identify shame people, stories need faces attached realize real people (like I) happened happen us. takes one super spreader.

For lot people country, threat still real one social circle experiences like this. even try pretend ""Mountain Dew even thing here"" it’s mall mate, literal current cesspool. indoor mall might add. think without retail mall. amount people gathering ridiculous &lt;-- North Texas resident anecdotal observations.

Its odd depending store, see anywhere 70 80% patrons wearing masks, others, maybe 20% less wearing them.

I happily surprised local Walmarts pretty good mask wearing average (almost always 50% better) compared grocery stores gas/convenience stores.

The away larger cities, less chance mask wearing, course.

I never seen location close 100% compliance. One roommates back home buffalo area work. bit achy 100.1 degree fever, went got tested Monday , told he’d get results today. Calls today, could anywhere 4-8 days!!! 

8 fucking days test results totally unacceptable. can’t work (he feels perfectly fine now), contact tracers aren’t checking people contact isn’t technically case, positive time gets results, may actually negative wait another week test.

Testing total disaster right frequent sub live area people pretend virus gone. feel like live two worlds, one global pandemic ever rising case counts fantasy land one cares virus doesn’t exist. Hard work perseverance best acts self care do.  “May have.” Lol I'm convinced power play. ""You say, say...and *might* reward good behavior feel like it."" Fucking scumbags. God’s country dammit. Ain’t nobody gonna tell wear mask. Coronavirus aint eten real. OK, they're black cop. Gotta keep around look good. Thank understanding

Still voting Biden Okay. It’s still sad died absolutely hate narrative. Get timelines straight. Even China delayed discoveries, outbreaks Iran Italy came _very_ early clearly showed dangerous virus was. Northern Europe US, WHO, NHS, CDC, RKI ignores facts hoped storm would pass, downplaying virus, calling pandemic talking shit masks. 

While everyone followed news subreddit knew shit would certainly hit fan. even then, countries since managed contain outbreaks.  [in Twitter amen, brother Literally companies basically virus spark immediately introduced somewhere, takes quite awhile start blaze silently spreading. Texas hotspot, hospitalizations growing much faster, positivity rate higher it’s spreading faster.

Cali testing twice much TX getting 40% cases police used ensure pay loans bankers commit crime. Dallas exact thing Abbott claiming Dallas' county judge ""rounding people jail"" masks citing reason refuses implement mask law bunch think ever unique special, really follow predictable, abusive behavioral script.

Fuck lot them. Furthering agenda every politicians’ reason existing.

The core problem GOP agenda fucking garbage. They’re selling hodgepodge non-solutions imaginary problems invented frighten gullible old white people. Yeah it’s free right now. course tourist underlying conditions would end one 3 ICU beds too. Everyone vacation right selfish. even small companies. worked tiny company literally 5 people went crazy anti union shit wvwn though nobody ever talked unions nearly fully open. Halting really mean anything unless go backwards. Restaurants wide open indoor dining. Bars open. Water parks open. can't concert sporting event basically anything else fair game. 

They halt elective surgery seems way order me. think getting close needing halt elective surgery probably closed bars 2 weeks ago. really, that’s basically contact charging using electromagnetic induction, it’s basically every modern power transformer works except much smaller scale. There’s reason phone laying completely flat charging pad, it’s completely unfeasible distances couple mm since efficiency appreciable distance follows inverse square law. You’re essentially taking little voltage transformer usually little square plug wall putting tweaked version charging pad phone gap coils separate device instead part power cord.

Tesla power plant literally beaming energy household via handwavey science-magic. 

The closest related concept could claim today ideas powering long range space travel lasers aimed Earth. allows us keep energy production Earth, gets around difficulty essentially build independently functioning nuclear power plant every spacecraft have. wear set example kids Lol lack profit laziest argument Tesla/SpaceX. Tesla biggest car company world soon. SpaceX send first humans Mars. 10 years nobody care 2010s profits. contact managers, employees needed do. anything, managers fault giving info HR. take employees part. labquest facilities offer test GA one first re-open. maybe first point past three months stick longer stop transmission virus, implement coherent testing process, overall strategy moving forward. Instead, got bunch grown children crying miss another Margarita Monday TGI Fridays wanting hair cut, reopened without sort plan things going worse started. Doubt. 125,000 deaths far. turning point making masks partisan issue tbh 
That article April 1st, current guidance coding article June says hospitals paid treating Medicare patients COVID, aren’t paid code death caused COVID. video you’re referring Scott Jensen Laura Ingram Show April 8, later said think people misclassifying concerns centered “less precise standards”. fact likely undercounting deaths caused virus. people learn hard way. Covid makes really hard breathe. can't measure metrics. Florida far data work with, tests actually work, concrete example things could go.

By comparison, NY flying blind. suggesting law enforcement officers allowed pick choose laws want enforce?(or enforce?)  I'm shocked.... anyone watched Dr. Jon Tallinger's YouTube videos? interview Dr. John Campbell? suggests Sweden's approach based malice, stupidity. know employer wants? employees need gaming rooms massages personal compliments order job. 

Yes. Bending backwards make job get complacent people. people whose job isn’t time sensitive ideas. that’s applicable places know what’s easier? Finding people good working hard begin with. 

And complacent employees don’t know ... there’s 100 people aren’t spoiled would job without fighting whole time. 

Cause don’t constantly fight life make harder themselves. don’t constantly ask day “Do want this?” it.

Businesses don’t hire complacent people. continue employee them.

Nobody owes job. Especially don’t even want it. +1 “The Stand” reference I'm pretty sure February. Like them. well good goal replace fossil fuel cars. think fact fired employees awful time really deluded instance. Ah good ol walmart. decided store call reason hours cut first. car broke stranded two half hours side road work one night, already missing day work next day tried acquire new ride seventeen year old car done life, even though messaged manager properly called decided one instance enough reason take another ten hours schedule punishment. 

Confronting store manager assured empty praise happen knows one people abusing points policy place right now. Ignoring point made hardcore textbook retaliation tactics cutting people calling anyway, especially recently warned one employee suspected Covid.

At point longer give fuck Walmart, greater extent piss poor country lets people exploited profit. every time pass electronics hear CEO spewing hiss bullshit display televisions gow right us, aren't, Doug? can't us ivory tower cursed coughed daily. sad used enjoy job. go one fucking poles dawn, tell sun hot! Bwah!!! lies!!! Hard lockdowns work, whatever fuck damn auto mod, can't even say r.e.d states huh Absolutely. initially said Texas would begin reopen state saw reduced numbers infections 14 days row. Three days said that, held press conference announce state going begin open effective immediately. (The exception reopening aware Texas governor’s mansion remains closed public tours safety reasons related virus.) Watch post get locked ""political comments"" 🤦 Can't say I'm interested. remember mother chairwoman local chapter charity convinced care agenda right. Bezos without confusing name first child No, rhetorical. know, asked it. Swedish strategy still disaster contrast rest developed world.

And thus stand uncorrected. area, health minister hammering idea lockdown opens up, actually socially distance lockdown prevent 2nd wave... lot people something made sacrifices others. ... it’s overridden another lot people determined negate and, sadly, succeeding. 

It’s awful compounds greater self-defeat—people tired frustrated add “well, bother, one else is” snowballs.

It’s hard despair all. good news seems cracks starting form foundation anti-maskers. Rubio, even says wear mask, states requiring mask. Texas might end requiring mask. Trump never concede mask stance, might end costing election. 

Its almost like people starting realize wearing mask better getting sick dying. real question is, want something important? Ugh, worked around schools safely say this; can’t even get 50% adults wear masks socially distance 0% chance getting children comply. tax money collected per person fraction collected West. dont like BJP resources government would take probably 50 years really change things India. Corruption culture also part Indians DNA probably another 2 generations change. One thing changed quicker would Legal courts speed cases India.

“*So said people, 'slow testing down, please.'* "" Right, fair, confirmed cases likely represent 10-20% total actual infections. point still stands 1k beds needed per day. charts track positive cases, corrected tests administered?

I've able find absolute # positives tracked. administer 1,000 tests 50 positives, 2 months later administer 10,000 tests 100 positives, well... # infected really doubled, fact gone lot.

I'd like get better picture what's going spike we're experiencing see much, any, spike positive tests related increased testing. didn’t “take” unpaid leave. simply didn’t show up. didn’t inform anyone. Well, Anders Tegnell much appealing way thinking violent ways trying put end (in countries). clear risk create even higher peaks (on spread). set pond river hold river certain level eventually get huge flow period. **It better let slow trickle through.** keep control take care need harm community immunity** could thus also relevant Sweden.  **We little cautious using word** breathes little given about, says Anders Tegnell.  basic idea probably starting become relevant see virus, **this need get. control Elon cunt. Duh..6 yrs economic devastation remember time launched something space. Clearly genius could find way get money speculative ventures. We've never traveled space before. /s


More seriously, site's love affair Elon stormy affair. Frankly, I'm opinion Elon inventor, he's corporate leader, business leaders rarely quite vital think themselves.


They're also far commonly sociopathic assholes.  strange coincidence ineffective boss manages premier electric car company world company actually sending humans Mars... Dawg, Polimath extremely reliable source covid data. wrong like it. forgot Life comes Liberty Pursuit Happiness. 🤦🏻‍♀️ FML. hopeful future without kids too. mindset kids ""boss level"" accomplishment happy life fairytale. bio-kids, I'm generally happier people know kids. plenty people world specific DNA continue going realistically make world better place. somewhat conceited think so.

If people focused time earth making better, instead procreating putting responsibility next generation, we'd much better position environment, civic involvement equality. give majority want accomplish (for women especially) kids. Society tells us kids inevitability expected, evolving adapting based state world not. wish people could form opinions based logic reasoning like yourself, instead letting emotional responses get way.

Also, surprise party... 😂😂😂
Yeah, I'm ripping jean seams pandemic quarantine binge eating. “Deepwater Horizon Halts Drilling Rig Burns Oil Gushes Out” I'm incrementalist nature I'll take whatever get. someone working job benefits, would like M4A open options. feel you. I'm NYC &amp; see people wearing masks part. really go often far, actually see people giving shit. hop sub... can't fathom it. virus hit us hard locked &amp; people took shit seriously part. Unfortunately, people acting ignorant, entitled, spoiled brats surprise one bit. ""USA"" fucking ass. Info fire legally. HR never friend. got $0 middle finger idiot president mexico feel still good, except mexico city everyone didnt give shit beginning. That's nice people planet physically work right? without can't get money therefore can't stay home work America. May have? obvious since February. going condescending answer question fuck Fixed it. Thanks! Covid tested /s

 “*So said people, 'slow testing down, please.'* ""  found good data source get good numbers. using [this little bit eyeballing, looks like New York's case count first started spiking around March 19. deaths started spiking 10-20 days later. 

Then look California, cases hovering around 1,500 per day May. first half June, cases started increasing around 2,500-3,500 per day (so nearly doubling course 2 weeks). But, death rate stayed pretty steady. fact, still trending slightly downward (in late March, California averaging 2 deaths per day, per million population. June, average closer 1.6 deaths per million).

Is possible hospitals getting better treating patients? Maybe supplies preparation improved? something inherently worse conditions New York led deaths? (At peak, New York 35 deaths per day, per million. Even now, New York still 3 per day despite way fewer new cases California since beginning May.) virus getting weaker? virus North East stronger? What's going happen 120,000+ medical bills deceased? Spanish flu 100 years ago people know pandemics work effective means warning educating people. Finland, example, much better prepared second wave first wave, unlikely second wave massively deadly. I’m sorry things shitty, thanks sharing.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Yeah difference Orange County Los Angeles county pretty drastic mask usage, well different neighborhoods. I’m glad nearly everybody live wears masks. Im sure two people got fired organize immediately make huge difference. 

The article title misleading. people no-showed without informing anyone. dusappeared didn’t respond calls days. Unfortunately isnt better farms, harvest dropping like flies. CDC wrong? happened trusting .26 percent death rate. Even lower people 60. keep fear mongering.

The CDC using IFR (infection) always going lower CFR (case). easier gauge CFR look *confirmed* cases compare *confirmed* deaths instead hand waving make numbers look better. 

It's estimate based lot assumptions, frankly line reality point. 122k deaths U.S., .26% implies actually 47 million infections United States. CDC estimate assumes 35% cases asymptomatic, account gap official count 2.4 million cases estimated count 47 million. gap makes sense 95% cases asymptomatic.

We'll know CDC full shit death count tops 858,000 want take risk? go unavoidable (and involuntary) work trip TX July August. would drive TX CA. avoid getting COVID19 hotels? wipe doorknobs/light switches, surfaces antibacterial wipes? people think beds sheets? line bed garbage bag plastic sheet bring blanket/pillow? medicine solution lower molecules? Don’t go, Texas bad right There's also ""Snack Ops""  ""Grand Canyon’s entire men’s basketball team placed quarantine four players two support staff members tested positive COVID-19."" I'm okay, ask Grandma /r/Moronavirus, right?

My kid turned 10 April, birthday party Minecraft. México looks like might catch up/pass Brazil Mexico testing even less Brazil, terrifying. Thank you. states similar law -- exception ""medical"" reasons. 

The NC anti-mask law ""medical"" exception text.  ""trade employment"" exception, seems cover nurses physicians. looks like volunteers, caregivers, patients, family, visitors, people ""medical"" reasons wear masks, never exempted.  Lots people (other employees) wearing masks hospitals nursing homes, routinely many years.  guilty felony? Somehow, seem plausible. 

I expect NC amend mask statute, add medical-reasons exception, sometime soon. Sounds like unionize c word generalization wouldn’t hold true here. It’s equal stupidity mask wearing etc. OH, know how, wont it. Literally supermarket employees wearing masks chins store announcement proclaims employees wear masks you! least 6 months worth. get bc I'm asshole every time went store TP bought pack. think we'll good. Ok. wonder Justin True diagnosed with. Maybe multiple personality disorder? Yeah, Karenovirus folks crazy. Don’t believe me. Read Good thing #1 podcaster proclaiming ""masks bitches"". I've disappointed see folks started hoarding Melbourne again. Hoping rest Australia keep cool.

The next week two telling. good news flair Ironic, it? Voters would vote give ""covid hoax panic"", vote someone knew died it. Hypocrisy best. open carry state single man balls put end it. Fucking pussies, every one next time see Texan I'll say open carrying fucking face Link well mean, maybe covid kill ignorant greedy them, give earth chance. seem eager enough catch it. Thankfully, mother tested 100% negative times make work double shifts! people tested positive, yes, sent home without pay eventually (and many arguments!) reimbursed time lost without use PTO. Im still locked down. available jobs require work public lot people wearing masks. Im putting family's health jeopardy little pay. Plus place seems able keep employees want know why. old office job people sitting close top place trouble keeping people spreading sickness first place. miss getting sick stop often. Problem: idiots exist throughout country.  Trump say 200k deaths good handling way back March? WAY Low. read this, less respect Elon. Due risk circumstances going month 4 quarantine fucking dont understand people cant make weeks even. Havent even damn Mcdonalds since March people US act like end days simply wear mask let alone stay home. Makes blood boil. wear mask. I’m noticing people equating fearful, “I refuse live fear!” tells scared. Plain simple. Putting mask makes come terms real scares them, wearing mask lets pretend everything normal. It’s cognitive dissonance really. Outside logically reason equate mask wearing fearful, sort distortion thinking. 🤷‍♂️ live Iowa, one taking virus seriously here, one wears mask public. number cases rising like crazy area, live farming community small towns. coworkers went birthday party 100 people present last weekend. lot people argue say Democrat hoax fake news. bad. People’s brains used 24 hour news cycle. Constant vigilance outside people’s wheelhouse. hello? human population compared earth produce feed them. forget study we've destroy whole areas wildlife produce food livestock. *species* going extinct per day, people *stil*l want junk, vacations,more food, babies, more.   Hahahaha.... this??xD

O.O Even gets it, ""get it"", continue usual survives. voted wrong that's all. could predicted this? /s Almost nothing substantial actually open NYC right now, 4 months everything went shit.

People means gone people means leave already way out. NYC become deeply impoverished place take decades climb hole, ever happens. gods testing tracing? appreciate compliment. Dipshit... Desantis? risk way high infant mortality pandemic. Completely understand waiting vaccine starting family. look model assumes worst case scenario mitigations minimal mask wearing. Even models predict 300k deaths September.

I get healthy dose skepticism pulling number ass skepticism bad people pretending virus hoax. Hotel Quarantine started Australia saw lot initial wingeing people forced 5 star hotels. situations definitely needed critique ultimately hotel quarantine major part solution. 60000 people cost 120 Million. Worth every penny every winge. see parabola end starting reopening?

I think find way two waves simultaneously. Well Parachutes may make Skydiving safe, Makeshift Parachutes? 

Also evidence masks much bigger factor? seen case numbers plummet mostly due social distancing ajd lockdowns masks widespread germany yet, decade since, 1% income group whose median income still recovered.

Legitimately interested, source this?

I often see people pointing income work statistics 1% (or rather 0.01%), forgetting vast majority wealth gain population category income work, interest. wondering source might accidentally done same. live WI, governor can't shut state anymore without approval right leaning state senate. Thanks gerrymandering! I'm sick people interpreting what""social distancing"" means. Social distancing parties dumbest shit. stay fuck home Zoom other. Dumb fucks!! Outline link:

I'm sure would love lord certain president giant middle finger well. Late 2021 would still extremely fast-tracked given long normally takes new vaccine get approved/manufactured scale. 8 months ago sentence would completely foreign me. unacceptably misleading headline likely create false confidence significant number people would hear headline look details briefing 

And think wrote articulate thing done significantly helped crisis?

The coordinating guidelines clinical response throughout world without strong CDCs ministries health. one function people developed world (or really anywhere outside clinical settings) know little nothing about. I'm working closely offices around world, particularly Africa. 

Related guidance function actual service delivery countries insufficient health capacity, particularly places also facing crises (e.g., Yemen middle war, horn Africa locust crisis, Bangladeshi refugee camps, etc.). people like callously flippantly says ""Honestly, fuck guys"" idea number lives saved daily basis. try undermine organization idea damage causes. I'm going say care sense ignorant reality. really knew essential say it. 

But live developing country somewhat understandable see essential work personal life. ways touch life. provided early warning reporting infrastructure. collect disseminate reporting countries around world members obligated report data. people like say obvious number cases increase x number date reason know that's true compiling data. country, state, municipality's departments health use data create modeling public health plans. also employs best IPC officers, public health specialists, epidemiologists world. guidance best practices used virtually everywhere world, including US. 

The also supports number vaccine trials studies virus itself. large funding pool available funds many trials going right now. countries like China, US, Canada, UK, Russia, number countries. sole public health agency world one central agencies supports others everywhere else. 

I get know appreciate much this. daily life interact staff administrators. There's reason so. express view fuck they're useless maybe consider fact there's hell lot know. *95 official update. parabolic curve end, though...  Nah, rest world moving future. Fuck US, better without schizophrenic meddling. bad news winter, good news Still going wear mask mean 60%?  Maybe someone could rig virtual hajj Especially since “didn’t know could die flu”

How fuck end like this? dont know people put weight vaccines tried true decades currently experimental varieties. People scientific literacy accepting read news. 

The fact electorate gets make decisions terms makes science policy ridiculous. fact Rick Perry head DoE reason start government scratch. wonder guys did.

Legit question, supposed feel sorry people? see this, don’t. know probably sounds cold kinda feel guilty feeling way. But, it’s well known protect yourself. yesterday's reported numbers Well.. today Oct 1st 98 days.  
at 125k current deaths, average death per day 565 stay 180k deaths Oct 1st.  
If put first death February 1st (reports say early Feb) average 862 deaths per day. Worldometers link projects 520-615 deaths per day Oct 1st - tough (projected death rate reduced drastically universal mask wearing). Hmm, quick search shows designed enhance *adherence* (basically fancier phone alarms), none laid course treatment.

Thats masks compared social distancing hand sanitizer. 9 year old step daughter we’ve taught wear mask. re-train every visit dads he’s asshole tells it’s nothing worry about.

How many people die people start taking seriously? Same, certain costs doesnt decrease proportionately u live alone. I’m sure protesters helped spread think states reopening much impact (especially people aren’t taking seriously). Millions people returning work, shopping, dining, traveling, recreating etc. make protests seem small comparison, no? bad that's exactly wins elections. Julian Castro ran nicest, softest candidate border crossers polled 1%. Biden told immigration activists go away vote Trump, crushed field.

Do see semantic games play...? Australia state returning back normal. less 5 active cases.

We keep hearing news US crazy many people still think nothing concerned about. Wearing masks also protects people. people understand this? TOOK LOOOOOONG? corona (we still one sorry) appears might found something might work hair loss. ^(No really.)

It's similar California *require* new homes rooftop solar. legal people ""need"" buy new home, *technically* ""not forcing"" people buy solar panels. law blatantly corrupt harms poor multiple ways, illustrate can't think governor lifetime winning popularity contests. like people happened right place right time usually.

Either way controlling virus wins popularity via safer feeling citizens functional economy. 

The main threat economy virus shutdowns. virus shuts businesses consumers regardless government, producing much higher hospitalization rates hospitals filled places go back lock downs core healthcare infrastructure crumbles.

It's pretty simple understand economy comes high population density areas aka cities areas easily vulnerable massive outbreaks. setup situation high population density areas cannot recover get economy back, plain simple really. 70-80% economy come areas vulnerable new virus cross strain herd immunity like flu. flu different peoples different lifelong antibodies combine form cross strain herd immunity means flu cannot easily sweep cities even though ideal high population density area. cross strain herd immunity works benefits vulnerable high population areas most, corona viruses offer option long lived immunity antibodies drop months susceptible re-infection again. People still mass denial short lived antibodies means, reality slowly hitting antibody tests start show recovered people without antibodies. develop weak non antibodies, develop antibodies last months, develop antibodies last 6 months. lucky average antibody lifespan could 24 months, probably lucky 2020 luck done left planet. !remindme 3 months 20 000+ people watching Rugby game one single solitary asymptomatic mild case slipped cracks. supposed gods testing track trace Germany missed almost *2000* people ONE area NZ acting like mere possibility slip absurd.

SIP order back April barely respected. Well, means populous nations f****d a** . Forget China, they're mass burning dead bodies now, I'm worried India. Sure strict lockdown rules, means daily spike lowered still keep growing. Right ~10k new cases every 24 hrs, think 20k cases per day far behind. One, massive two months later? Shocked face! literally compare anything anything. 

I'll compare covid fridge
- potential cause severe illness given proper attention
- vaccine available prevent either entering home. method avoidance
- experienced accelerated rate spread respective discoveries. jazz musicians 40s 50s looked SHARP.

I'm sure lot left would defend Obama, faced figures, citing inherent difficulty responding appropriately novel threat. many us would take plunge vote team offered much better plan (projected save 100000+ lives)? 


How many us would offered slightly better plan (projected save additional 10000-20000 lives)? Well someone lives US, say still haven’t seen pandemic. I’ve seen protests riots boarded windows. Haven’t seen single visibly sick person yet. ""Spike"" lol.  Ambulances end street organising tests, allowing 50m walk get tested, really struck me. good idea. Maybe invest construction hardware? Like diggers, forklifts etc... (/semi-s) supporters wear masks. read too. Often advice same.

Other mispoken word asymptomatic presymptomatic, really got anything wrong. going come back ""evidence human human transmission"" line, would suggest read dictionary, establish absence evidence =! Evidence absence may lets hope one cames brilliant idea giving population spanish flu make imune covid somehow think protesting weird numbers going up? 

People New York righteous virus decided spread anymore, reason. sure. needs incentive businesses enforce though. know one business offer discount random people see wearing mask.

This doesn’t account people putting approach register though, they’ve solved issue employees monitor customers.

The idea doable since it’s pretty small store. Good, Natural selection. think people stupid shit like make place people tried hardest get sick comes hospital beds. idiots deserve power scientific health-care system stay alive innocent people accidentally got sick. people discust me.  restrictions start ease places? swear,people 100 years seem imune,this fourth people 100 years got covid survived Right seen movie Idiocracy? us kids won't. think crock definitely get pregnant. least anything positive come could end Terry Crews President Comacho would significant improvement current leadership. Except going away European countries maybe US individualism going kill hundreds thousands. Anyone comparison numbers NYC? OP, I’m trans. always wonder parents stuff, willing gamble relationship child? “It’s big deal” well it’s big deal, necessary first place large celebration extended family agrees one two social roles fill. 

It’s even specific trans people. Gender reveal parties don’t seem place world LGBT gender issues raised. want child strong, hard man? Outwardly tough respected internally emotionally stunted 10 year old needs cry? want raise young girl, teach keep legs closed establish worth good wife would be? right?

You bringing new soul world, one wanted loved. Focus that. happen numbers fudged. think measure confirmed deaths/confirmed cases worthwhile metric comparisons. That's also largely abandoned media.

Excess deaths metric. realise say would listen paid Chinese WHO. Start reading science papers independents, paid political establishments. that? think correct? Buzzfeed says there’s increase cases BLM  US far worst country world, European countries opening back going normalish life rates stay get higher none stay inside soemthing good everyone yourself. Here’s thought. Maybe bars casinos shouldn’t open right now. help people originally told wear masks medical professionals face scarcity. readily available people advocating them, people protesting rioting streets. Meanwhile, media stays quite people gathering large crowds wearing masks.

 can't believe something basic wearing mask become politicized. seems like party opposite one matter illogical hypocritical is. office, wear masks,. ""We're family"" 

That following governor's orders working home. actual proposition ""would eat bowl alternative wear mask social distance?"", answer probably 30-50% Americans ""Yes"" Good thing we're wearing masks already Texas daily cases beyond containment testing, contact tracing ""cheap"" measures like face masks. need lock-down reduce new cases manageable numbers.

Right Texas choice either lock-down humanitarian catastrophe. Additionally triage least one week already unavoidable due late lock-down. 65% quarantine themselves, 35% likely social distance 2x fewer people outside. hope wear mask though... We'll know soon enough, Brazil reaches 14% death ratio (about 170,000 deaths) it'll worse UK least. I, American, think it’s negative reasons positive. US supposed great, first-world country medical advances... healthcare, unaffordable, supposed top line. Meanwhile, citizens would rather get hair done live would rather die wear mask; would funny wasn’t terrifying. government won’t mandate, even model, mask wearing (our real defense) country decided get back life usual pretend virus doesn’t exist anymore (another card government’s deck) let chips fall may. live EXTREME hotspot state, I’d say maybe 30-40% ppl wear masks pack beaches bars party like it’s 1999. whole scene really bizarre would LOVE another country take headlines chat subjects I, one, terrified virus. careful don’t know it’ll enough surrounded state country full people don’t give damn! Today someone sitting bar Nevada wearing mask said think cases increasing increase testing. sat next customer Florida, customers Nevada/California, also wearing masks. People really stupid.  can’t believe bars even open right now. Low income jobs evaporating across world. impossible workforce simply move find something stable, enough jobs left everyone times also many completely empty bank accounts month two. would people even go guarantee they'll find shelter employment anywhere else? Good luck getting base take dang thing.

Just great huh?? Great....

Ffs

Hurry hurry... 5k deaths catch states reopening right now? course can't lockdown permanently. That's distance wear masks. Locking last resort cases get high. honestly think come that, shit starts getting much worse he's gonna supporters left. States start running money people going lose jobs left right unemployment fund dries up... GG. Lol, probably pick choose want read, missed period incomplete lag time death occurred death certificate completed, submitted NCHS processed reporting purposes. delay range 1 week 8 weeks more, depending jurisdiction cause death.

371 Covid deaths reported far last week, according CDC still may data 8 weeks ago.

So may want rethink joy! Actually, Life Death, Strength Weakness, Journey Destination. see. would make sense. 

It’s sad government lacks transparency. think it’s reinforcing people’s lack faith it. think Worldometer counts 12AM-12PM UTC NBC counting 12AM-12PM EST. Wuhan like abstinence. American lockdowns like ""okay, head"" true pretty much industry. Construction one industries least able social distance. bring r0 limit spread hospitals overwhelm like beginning Texas. We’ll agree disagree numbers mean context.

My question is, what’s goal? convincing people rest lives going living hell going benefit anyone, even you’re saying true (which don’t believe first place)? convincing people there’s point anymore encourage do? easiest case wrongful termination I've ever seen I'm sure is. shit, happened. real possibility Absolutely agreed. I'm sick people saying implies precautions mitigation pointless. That's true. 

At least, we're going get it, better us get months future next year (hopefully) better treatments. economy collapse virus allowed run unchecked regardless. LESS BAD lockdown. Moreover, one recover unemployment, death. it. lockdown. wear mask times, curculate masks longer youre there. wash wear new one wash old one wear new one etc source great disappointment. believe future impact. Neither political party inspires me. dude said contained virus back like February. **""Out 48,000 Employees, Two Received Termination Notices Told OK Stay Home.

It's longer title far accurate. Yeah know frustrating process obtain, I'm sure unemployment insurance would kick person employee sick believe want wrong accounts.

There's nothing celebrate year IMO. ""BuT tHey'rE OverCoUNtinG cOvID DeAtHs!"" got downvoted libtards. looking American manufacturers, GM coming likely expensive electric pickup SUV, next years lot coming pipeline, varying models prices built modular platform. There's also update Bolt larger roomier. Beyond there's Ford Mach-E coming out. Outside US lot manufacturers also pumping EVs, space flooded that's great thing. 

Tesla far game town, honestly manufacturers able provide better experience terms ease purchasing vehicle want state, ease comes repairs warranty issues, comfort knowing fit/finish quality better little features like Android Auto Apple Carplay available. 

I know get next vehicle EV, love Elon Musk (though think Tesla engineers fine individuals produced decent work despite adverse environment) I've looking every competitor Get serious things like thorium reactors starters. 

Efforts mitigate global warming treated seriously funded least thoroughly something like amalgam WPA, Manhattan project, Apollo project.

[Crickets heard]

Oh, mean ""they took er jerbs!"" relationship employers amazing. words heard productive environment amazing sense security.

This last thing saw coming reading comment. actually go back make sure lose sight wrong line somewhere. Never heard story like before. cool. think “billionaires bad” easy phrase make fun surface that, reality, expanded much further. 

The problem is, billionaires helping people entirely them. person force help world them, entirely control money goes. surface, sounds like positive, directly apply money believe important. reality, lot people suffering this. 

Billionaires easily get laws passed exceptions made simply funding bills voted on. I.e. ALEC. ALEC made politicians corporations alike, corporations others money collaborate create legislation. Corporations directly contribute bills favor, politicians bring floor ensure funding campaigns. Billionaires CEOs lot power politics this. 

Billionaires act based widely regarded best public people want, act based think best people like them. example, Bill Gates charter schools. He, essentially, single-handedly strong armed Washington allowing charter schools, despite state repeatedly shutting attempts finally went through. data charter schools better students, plenty data they’re taking much needed funding public schools already underfunded. 

They apply money want to, Bill Gates genuinely great things overseas, he’s kind best-case-scenario. properly tax wealth, billionaires exist, money would able distributed way public able vote give opinions on. Less money billionaires pockets directly lead money areas desperately need public funding like social services, schools, public transportation, etc. 

I know billionaires don’t billions cash. biggest argument “then sell stock” “then won’t make much money” well... good. absolutely reason $50 billion. one deserves $50 billion. billionaires still way richer almost every American tax wealth appropriately. It’s much every billionaire bad person, billionaires exist holding wealth used fund necessary programs country. sounds like teacher lost control classroom. personally would rather go surge. Well first thought, kills ideas ""it affect me"" agree, data key, everything else point irrelevant. need information. Ok. I’ll bite... Florida people traveling around Florida. live Key West we're slammed last weekends w people driving 3 counties north us bars open.

And, mindset people traveling total Florida-Man.

Bars restaurants started closing bc staff tested positive. 

It's going get way worse, govt concerned pandering business owners. Reopening going save economy. rich therefore makes c*nt... problem state done 700,000+ test (TN) around 33,000 positive. Testing widely available since beginning April. Anyone go get tested free. think would see lot positives many million already infected. joke company. I’m glad live time stuff like gets plastered interwebs see. writing may open company breaking contract.

""Most people realize law generally requires written, signed agreement transaction legally binding. people realize, however, email exchange also satisfy legal requirements collectively constitute binding contract."" Companies aren’t obligated provide you. work them, it’s rules. That’s life.  Doctors generalists, like mechanic. takes years learn background prepared symptoms ailments injuries, patient care drug interactions legal processes. 

But treating pandemic like Jiffy Lube. need small subset full service spectrum treat one ailment.

The med students fine. Wtf? Get stone age. Bad choice words White House... I’m sure they’re totally going admit wrong apologize psychopaths. 

Just give time, I’m sure they’ll come around. gamble online. it! Live life! arguing semantics. Call partisan, call political, they're referring people's viewpoints changed based affiliation nothing else. Ron Barbosa, one family members, didn’t attend party day, nephew hosted Barbosa’s wife, doctor, said refused go due safety infected include two children, two grandparents, Barbosa’s parents cancer patient. Three hospitalized, including Barbosa’s parents sister, Kathy, battling breast cancer.

Wow. ""We've tried nothing completely ideas"". cause issues like lightheadedness difficulty breathing especially medical conditions. also introduce racial prejudices stereotypes. believe Cuomo said shame travelers don’t follow order. article? find anything couple Google searches catch corona either way. cares flies could didnt?? Switch edibles    Yes say problem. like good thing. People tend avoid going doctors. requirement ensures get needed care guess know hair, huh. think someone talking Facebook summed pretty well...and 100% serious: 


""If million people need die 30 million people lose jobs, fair price pay""

I wished could punched screen...but mentality here: money life Moose knuckles need dealt with. Disband department rehire select candidates. Enforce mask mandate. 47 cases Myrtle Beach transmission Roanoke, VA well. construction same, tho. work totally done social distancing. live rural IL town exactly same.. Yes, currently working data science getting masters. want refute points moment cause time really believe putting discussion good faith. let's assume are.

For example, Vitamin issue. mobile pulling quotes super feasible, pardon misrepresent argument. quick scan google highlights 40% adults vitamin deficiency number may 76% Black americans. know percentages work, example fairly dark skinned individual vitamin levels normal (June 10, 2020). 

Yes, anecdote let's keep rolling.

I carrier sickle cell (1/365 rate, 1/13 carrier Black americans). fact, health issue vision isnt 20/20 unless corrected. also listed gene expression also qualify for.

I telling things say true, percentages speak themselves, think arguments bad faith presenting values terms race/ethnicity. 

Most Black americans 100% Sub-Saharan African. example, siblings around 60% Sub-Saharan African, 20% European, 20% South East Asian. one siblings exception, people would assume Black americans. 

Essentially, science fails account genetic diversity Black americans, goes back systemic issue race. america, considered African decent skin tone darker paper bag consideration many groups compared similarities amongst them. believe researchers considered this, would get nuanced story genetic expressions. add race human construct, starts fall apart bit more, that's different story.

Now let's talk COVID experience start March 16th.

- Got sick COVID symptoms considered atypical US well known countries (GI, neuro)

- SOB sats 88%, go hospital spent 1 hour talking price treatment pocket struggling breathe. Mentioned financial assistance low income individuals insurance. I'm trying hand insurance card ignored. Nurse finally realizes insurance. Given oxygen 10 minutes released. hospital total 1 hour 20 mins.

- SOB gets worse. go back hospital sats 92%. Get told go home come back unless blue face (remember earlier, dark skinned black person would turn blue???)

- Main covid symtpoms go away, dealing new round symptoms including localized headache. Go urgent care get checked out. Doctor jokes reading statistics book, tells head pain afro.

- Headache gets worse. go back urgent care. Actually get blood work tests done. Told everything normal. Doctor said prescribe drugs ""misused"". told doctor tylenol help, get told take tylenol leave. ask recommendation neurologist.

- Neurologist looks test result notices several abnornal values indicating clotting. Turns out, headaches blood clots inflammation brain. MRI confirms this. Neurologist gives prescriptions finally feeling like week.

Now tell story illustrate bigger issue otherwise healthy Black 2x year old. entire time trying get treatment, assumptions made color skin impeding treating COVID symptoms could potentially let blood clot kill me.

And worst part is, story uncommon. many studies done around Black americans healthcare recieve, even control wealth factors.

Your post ignores fact Black americans treated worse counterparts, also facilitates issue hand: assuming color one's skin, certain innate qualities.

I meant short, oh well... mention scandinavia oh hitting home people allowing to......jesus chrst hate damm virus shit!!!! Yep. Right time. know coming children, refuse accept that. Fuck adults this. Behind bastards podcast couple episodes musk, something picked on: use idea somehow working Tesla means saving world, justifies shitty pay appalling treatment staff. americans still planning huge parades/parties/gatherings july 4th? I'm sorry, naming store could think of. 😔 People still look funny wear mask entire shift. I've months. I'm literally person factory see wearing one. virus stop spreading sight safety officer people, take fucking break night. Cruising around sub last months proof enough. one good thing he's done, I'll give props that. rest fucking shitshow  crazy NYC really pulled stops build capacity.

They Javitz center built like weeks, central park facility built, etc etc etc.

Right they're discussing POTENTIALLY opening popup?

It's worth noting Texas larger population New York well. can. I'd rather mask thing. school sign realize unemployment insurance right? extended people temporarily work due coronavirus. There's plenty things wrong, make things Yeah. days, cut could kill know. bacterial disease like tuberculosis cholera basically death sentence, antibiotics. Dread day becomes norm again.  Nah, EU politicians actually listened scientists realized shtf.

Europeans smarter Americans theyre less entitled. leadership class actually tries act like adults. Yeah leave middle this, go smoothly, find better job time. Lololol predicting doom, one way another. say various reasons I’ve stayed home protests lately. would get couch start screaming streets though. I’ve fucking enough. I’ve never cared politics learned lesson. It’s obvious administration cares lining rich friends pockets even cash expense working class. It’s fucking mental red necks hillbillies can’t see this. (I’m white say that). Rant over. sound like climate change deniers.

Riiiigghhht. I'm going data feelings? 

This dumbest thing read while. Congrats? something managers say shift blame. really expect people this. get medical test done often end hospital result Nope. Never said knew suffered permanent damage. damage observed.

No need make shit dude. resting bed head feels better. :P

The neurological effects covid studied starting gain attention increasing news coverage people complications beyond CDC's ""you'll better 14 days"" narrative. Vox published good articles. Google turn quickly.

I'm support groups people neuro issues stories similar care. long stock market keeps going up, everything copacetic. hold responsible loss life. inaction. carriers virus. prob think good move R.I then, good move NY now. kind annoying threatening sue goes thing. hardly see it’s “good news” number COVID-19 cases ICU beds isn’t lower today April. Sounds like you’re husband could easily avoided situation. Maybe *your* attitude makes NYers give *you* attitude say hate. I’m editing shit. 

You give bad attitude, get one back. aren’t fake nice. 😂 Strong immune system means better cytokine storms...  Thank you. hope too! Texas, August?? soon different president gets office enter state emergency full lock down. Meanwhile bumbling fool entered state emergency illegal immigrants keep country running.

Oh, ironically spent vast amount paint black.

DJT, Black Paint Matters :/ nah. boring fuck now. im gonna wait covid fuck thatll that. Haha kinda looks like little bee though. think fun. pandemic political, national leadership states made so. Texas entering hard dark time. knew coming. us health care trying warn everyone. it’s exhausted. morally compromised working system doesn’t care worry friends co workers front lines.

 going asked give everything little left. already carrying weight nation seems concerned “pursuit happiness” portion Declaration Independence, “life” part. still digging overused N95’s paper bags instead given proper PPE promised. least New York felt like together. another lie Coronavirus uncovered see. 

Stay safe everyone. ER doctor, greatest wish never meet you. we’ve met, hope never see ever again. get mine either. wonder difficult would get death certificate :) district board voted full reopening. never thought teaching would life threatening career. don’t pay enough. wouldn’t showing locked like want part state?

Council unanimously approved bill Thursday morning make illegal employers fire, discipline, otherwise retaliate workers speak unsafe coronavirus conditions.  
  federal law already prohibits retaliation workers call unsafe conditions, federal Occupation Health Safety Administration “very poor track record” handling complaints, said former OSHA official Debbie Berkowitz. cases, said, complaints dismissed.  Many states Australia community transmission. two States confined capital cities larger population NZ, good contrast. States community transmission better contests NZ. achieved without lockdown. bad app lmao Hmmm... ist firstworld bias. Firstworlders never saw non-functioning healthcare system, dont believe happen them.

EU needed three countries exploding take seriously (ITA, E, F). also CaNN0T hApPen HeRe. Good 12 days past became symptomatic. information I'm searching says 11 days max someone could contagious. I'll probably err side caution information incorrect? Castiglione D'Adda (small town) 1.7% population die weeks 70% showing antibodies later.  probably considerably past worst-case scenario point, since better treatment spread much, much slower.

If elderly careful mostly keep nursing homes, could like Stockholm-level scenario 0.1% population died (7000 deaths Houston, population 7 million). might best case mitigation. course idea happens afterward, best case would immunity lasting disease petering out.

In there's NYC scenario 0.3% PFR Bergamo scenario 0.6% PFR. ended lockdowns, virus allowed run full course.

If mean individual mortality, Belgium numbers (the hard-hit place still counting) indicate 0.5% mortality outside nursing homes 50% nursing home residents. anything try advance reprehensible political agenda, right? time read article atm

Did ever say could choose come effecting employment status?

If specifically state that, unethical, letting go seem go said.

Come work = risk &amp; employed

Don't come health concerns = safe &amp; unemployed Agreed. even reached inflection point yet, would required signify reversal rate change cases - deceleration. even still means little longer peak reached cases start go down. eli5? k95 mask k95 mask? matter medical use not?

All x95 masks filter 95% particulate correct?

&amp;#x200B;

edit: saying right did. woudl rather masks not. tell humble state Idaho masks social distancing taken seriously even though cases jumped 190% last weeks. States constitutions too. sheriff claims enforce unconstitutional order, whether refer state federal constitution ambiguous. guess am, I'm also blaming communicating effectively could ;) gotta keep instagram content 😭 skimmed article - breakdown beds occupied? words, considering “elective?” seems like could folks put procedures became urgent time. aunt said he's responsible riots. DR. Fauci one started riots. heard nearly fell over. country collective brain damage

Totally agree, even presented solid researched information people still defend lies spouted current administration.

I'm done :( Many people can’t afford daily delivery stuff home. Many people leave home essential stuff allows stay home. people often need care children thus daycares stay open open entire pandemic. people leave house essential medical needs like dialysis. Death rates going down, that's retirement home outbreaks (high death) younger people getting it.

In record numbers.

Anyway, friend close going on, invent crazy theory turns everything head. :) Pretty normal guess. Zombie cop: send cops

COVID-19 hospitalization numbers rise Houston

 

Author: Chloe Alexander, Michelle Homer

HOUSTON — regular ICU beds Texas Medical Center used, according numbers released the TMC website, officials say add more.

Hospitals Houston's Medical Center move ICU patients beds normally used critical care.

Twenty-eight percent ICU patients treated COVID-19.

Even surge capacity reached, Houston hospital leaders sent warning.

""If trend continues, hospital system capacity become overwhelmed,"" TMC leaders warned Houstonians letter Wednesday.

On Thursday, four CEOs signed letter backed off, saying level alarm ""unwarranted.""

The average ICU occupancy rate world's largest medical center 70 80 percent, higher rates unheard of.

""It completely normal us ICU capacities run 80s 90s,"" Methodist Hospital CEO Dr. Marc Boom said. ""That's hospitals operate.""



Boom said what's different one four ICU patients COVID-19, forcing hospitals shift balance care. 

Boom said plenty beds Houston Methodist hospitals used ICU beds needed. Texas Children's Hospital accepting adult COVID non-COVID patients help ease burden.

They said majority hospitalizations seeing coming younger people, patients stay hospitals long less likely die COVID.

All CEOs said Thursday hospitals equipped plenty PPE ventilators treat COVID-19 patients.



The interview Boom Thursday different tone compared last Friday CEO sent email employees saying Houston Methodist hospital appeared ""nearing tipping point.""

“Should number new cases grow rapidly, eventually challenge ability treat COVID-19 non-COVID 19 patients,"" Boom said

Thursday morning, Gov. Greg Abbott issued Executive Order to ensure hospital bed availability COVID-19 patients number cases increase alarming rate. 

The governor’s order suspends elective surgeries hospitals Harris, Bexar, Dallas Travis counties.

That's bad news hospitals already taken huge financial hit elective surgeries make money.

HERE YA GO! wish wrong called countries ""curve"" would look like Denver 1918... give away time money raise someone else. Actually shutting Ischgl one reason shutting parts central Europe. Oh God, I'm incredibly sory loss. Since end March “early” whole scenario? Earlier now, guess. That’s different what’s claimed social media. Old people whatever, young people tried super hard get take virus seriously early days. Hol Still wondering people protesting assistance. 

Wait families evicted mortgages foreclose. Sounds like smart place. area generally smart given recent epidemic late night fireworks, even town smart I'm sure undercurrent ignorance sabotage efforts. would me, would change last will. realized outside way better home. According reading law, also longer required wear motorcycle helmets August 1st. Mardi Gras masks. 

Hence saying ""you misreading this"" No, we’re not.

- thought early issue aging would important connection pandemic, given happened Italy. really managed get brief meeting happen much. Instead, wrote debate articles thought would happen elderly.

A months later , spread infection Swedish elderly homes fact deaths homes counted thousands.

Despite calls from, among things, Public Health Authority protect elderly corona virus, Ministry Social Affairs never engaged senior research council 15 well-known researchers government appointed December.

Social Minister Lena Hallengren emphasized Council would propose care elderly designed prevent serious illnesses keep elderly healthy.

And great idea, says Ingmar Skoog University Gothenburg.

What think would meant spread infection Council worked?

- hard say, suggested, example, coordinating function, would good 290 municipalities. suggested, example, protective equipment, sampling. also suggested reducing contacts elderly healthcare staff. also think lot decisions could come earlier, effect would been, never know.

In comment, Social Minister Lena Hallengren says time start work Senior Research Council.

Saying death rate lower thought could mean lot people going die. still could many many more. rate, I'm pretty sure trolling. Cue party throwing bus even harder already have. Yes. 0.28% infected die. 0.28% whole population died. 20% infected (supposedly. number could wrong.) means 1.4% infected died. mean IFR population would 1.4%, say infection rate could (and almost certainly was) imbalanced. means population IFR would 0.28% lower bound.

Or Bergamo, argument, 0.58% lower bound. R0 changes time, it’s affected behavior.  It’s factor make significant changes choices.

You're also correct. Somewhere along line believing science became hate country. lot dumb people place. people age 70, dying catching covid-19 usa 10x less likely person 70 dying living USA 2017:

God`s Gonna Cut lyrics © Universal Music Corp., Song Cash Music show must go on! &lt;&lt;insert Mickey chuckle time lot youger deaths simply sheer amount new cases. (% still low, count wise higher) might right, many small sample sizes.  left Taiwan list, that's it. One problem though may people, possibly even large subset, exposed fought without ever testing positive. many 25, 10, tested positive places?

In case they're broadly consistent serology studies have. Lol smug real folks.  No. people came Mayflower. would advise following Asian countries instead. weekly numbers Americans needing aid work far exceed the previous record 695,000 first-time jobless claims made during severe recession fall 1982. Nice mental gymnastics 🤸‍♀️ unemployed people available states could hire speed process up... early April compliance still poor May really seen many people without masks Letter grades unofficial, sometimes useful patient communication. However, dentist/hygienist noting chart state hygiene. help take better care better result, shame you. always say, aren’t teeth, don’t get angry it, really should. Yeah could worded better, idea same. need daily anxiety attack covid also going one car accidents heart disease. Trump right, tired winning. None matters enforced either state action (fine, arrest) social pressure (shaming, shunning, turning people away stores, etc) Another giant waste taxpayer money stroke ego. 

Dozens federal employees working two weeks hate (campaign) rally. weak. really good points ☝️ good sir, matter fact, moved states together family last November! 

I know well situation overlaps yours, however - went family home family home, obviously lot easier moving somewhere without connections. Logistics ended difficult, thanks several-month-long #konmari beforehand agreeing dump 90% remained directly storage unit (we brought bed in-house). also able pay friend hours help lifting things. 

The unexpected problems ended ""the house crowded"" ""the new job scrounged pay bills Hell earth, find another everything went shit"". COVID-19 happened months scrambled things - attending church, starting make friends, course closed. trying arrange play-date family across street, kid age - still happened. ended locked house family members still love dearly, unfortunately share values (want nothing child, which... can't help take personally). father moved tent backyard one point could home office. appreciate much, *so* disappointed brother. mixed bag. 

Let's see, climate different enough interesting - rainier also hotter summer, difficult husband far. again, overlapping COVID-19, knows long-term outcome be? husband also misses family lot, even though onboard move. economic refugees - hometown got expensive even 2 middle-class salaries could afford stay there. 

I would say would need drive Maine, fly - COVID factor either. save crapton money time things. course plan route carefully, confirm there's place arrive. would suggest best practice something rather difficult: driving Maine advance scout potential locations. Though... hotels etc. reopen. decide go ahead this, there's lot #konmari need anyway, time wait open back up. Also - tell anyone Maine visiting from, possible :/ local rental car might good... given circumstances. 

That's everything head might serve advice. joke, moving states. It'll one stressful experiences life, even turns best possible choice. calm wife keep oriented positively toward future. hiking trails near are? long walk nature might nice option. again... good luck.  Salons/spas etc luxury. staff right protect close contact unable social distance work. I'm industry. slightly different theres mandated laws us. one suffer undue hardship due lack haircut. Go bed, friend. late dem Vaterland ;) Even without deaths long term issues coming pretty crazy. got statistic today!

Well, least), Italy? Thank you! hope too! thanks laugh. 🤣 ...Dense... wish Trump would tell us need wear masks part wear one set good example. shouldn’t political. saving people. mask controversy (for lack better term) makes angry upset world. set good example.

College saying reopening ""hybrid"" like anyone knows fuck supposed mean fight Fed, last time checked corona care Fed fighting corona. Oh got yeah, cancelling chemotherapy monitoring tumor completely elective immediately life threatening. That's elective thing get cancelled hahaha.

To honest normally attack people seeing responded condescending way really quite despicable, bottom barrel trash. someone family die cancer certainly assure getting chemo elective. someone like came suggested something like elective regarding family member, let alone daughter, would bad day you. Thank giving good laugh, good night. 👍😅😆 Sooooo, like rest fucking world are. Welcome enlightened side, doc. anyone else tired winning yet? Also definition sociopath ""15 cases soon become 0"" - Donald J. Trump long Covid picked Tulsa give painful diarrhea? I'm looking forward part. guy protests???

""70% occupied ICU beds Texas Medical Center system currently taken non-coronavirus patients, 27% occupied people tested positive Alrighty. chart itself.

Obesity yes, medical condition. girl doesn’t look obese even doesn’t mean DIE? 

Why people mean fat people? Shaming people losing weight never worked fact research found opposite affect. Losing weight hard especially don’t resources help you. Everyone says obesity bad one wants find programs offer affordable assistance obese. 

People chose take drugs even though know it’s bad(and illegal). people end addicted. help recover multiple outlets support covered insurance know one can’t overcome own. 

People addiction food know it’s killing don’t know stop. least drugs likely go without seeing/being offered recovering addiction. one needs food live,and support without reverting back old habits. 

Either way it’s none business it’s life. Don’t act like care strangers health regardless bc don’t. Offer condolences move on. *shoots America face daring ask wear mask* darn protesters gathering groups tens thousands

Are sarcastic better ways show support massively spike minority death rates COVID19... Seems counter-productive almost suicidal point. Return? us never left quarantine.

In NYC lockdown since early March. Food shop every two weeks. Starbucks (pick-up only, they’re open again) dinner delivery week. Aside outside apartment thing sitting park, chair apart everyone N95 mask on, twice week get sun. That’s it. travel, shopping, haircuts, contact. Saw mom since March. Working full time school. life endless zoom calls. 

Yes, sucks. 

Can’t stand people wear mask tucked chin, worse, none all. way get rid thing everyone wear mask. Stop babies. faster everyone gets board faster thing gone. Yes dont technically wear one also dont allow business provided make reasonable accommodation them. Eg, ordering via phone pickup etc hate lump latin america together y'know, let's cancel funding basically nothing tho, since wont ticket fine. washington, 1/3 people still wearing mask like used to. left house today people food pet food wearing mask. mind blown like 1 10 people wearing mask. ashamed American sometimes. I'll put way, vaccine administered someone already sick much like putting condom sex. nothing help. 100% proactive. possible scenario vaccine could help someone already sick truly vaccine normal use word instead drug system antibodies developed person gets sick antibodies used fight virus. would vaccine likes never seen before. However, successful vaccine never developed virus nature would irrational could possibility. Long answer short. No. would help all, entirely proactive. Testing funding done state level

Explain scientific and/or medical rationale this. $10,000 total cost government. 13 sites still nothing. Even one state that’s nothing comment? It’s sad, part reopening university requiring anyone going campus get flu shot downgraded “strongly recommending” due backlash got announcement.

Gotta keep things going people clean water, drivable roads (for emergency/essential workers), electricity, etc.

Things break people’s homes; can’t expect someone stay quarantine without working toilet running water either. I’ve working mess since April. Doesn’t look like me, looks like random sampling I’d guess online responses. Either way dumb survey study is, again, misleading guessing going worldmeters.info. information wrong places cases/deaths different days reported. Hawaii? mean concentration Pay lockdown. Fucking, essential bullshit. major issue many people I’ve talked personally it; feel though reacted masks simply aren’t necessary things can’t bad. cite numbers talk actual stats call sheep thing I’m following large brotherhood people want see economy fail. No, Deborah, want make sure don’t see huge wave death; hey, time bar beach clearly important lives around you. is. whole point easy get now, abused it, govt gonna find later rain hell you.

And it. govt workers dedicated point future, people took advantage they'll expected pay back money alongside hefty fine likely.

I'm govt worker, live shit. Finding fraud feel good work. people deserve get nailed get power root out... boy nice. Even basic understanding would great. way degree biology, I'm draftsman. tried explain replication process others work stared told flu. oh it’ll i’m sure. don’t WANT one gives flying fuck. goal start saving money move another country. What's going Canada?

Plus many Americans making money stimulus checks working 40 hours week  Nice know care break lives around you. makeup.. masks fuck want look bad  much would gave friends? Yes, know chose focus half forecast line. That's point forecast entirety still shows decline, temporary bumps common occurrence kinds graphs, something that's common occurrence graph. Yet despite bumps, trend is, like forecast, net decline.

In short, worry much. Read half forecast next time. What? Lol people making unemployment Covid weekly payments working 40 hours week. can’t spend money, it’s funneled businesses. Big businesses able survive cutting wages, furloughing taking advantage government handouts, overall liquidity have. Smaller businesses struggling, LOT.  want save couple minutes, I’ll summarize. video infuriating expected.

Running math income loss five month gap pretty sobering.  better lot people, too, terms able still work little home current position.

I begrudge payroll help small businesses $2.4k wife .gov helped... *people* instead really big businesses would really helpful. guys there?

Partying odd... Seems totally counterintuitive, mind higher RH equals lower evaporation rates, thus higher virus stability. Wish explained it’s opposite. Thank good link, though.  one else alarmed ""only"" 65%? 1/3rd people would happily go bars even massive spike?? really, one single localized outbreak pushed numbers slightly, there's good reason believe that's start second wave anything reopening weeks ago never significant increase anywhere.

And reason would even notice one incident numbers low already, end lockdown would lead increase numbers would seen way sooner, way often. makes sense draw conclusions entire country one localized event.

Edit: Also, new daily cases already back proves argument. “This isn’t vacation owner’s fault,” said O’Dell. “People may made reservations four months ago can’t get money back.”

This peak sunk cost fallacy.  ""If""? ""if""? I’m sure. know schools couldn’t even that, think starting see rest first wave goes first Imagine living whole life, becoming adult thinking businesses assets dissapear said business goes bankrupt 



Moreover, industry vital nation can't handle simple reorganization, industry business hands private interests incredible fast happened.

here are, June 24th.....and either highest 2nd highest.

completely erasing 12 weeks progress. figured. But, information ideas new means.  never said long lockdown go for. hell could make comment without stating this? said says absolutely nothing! water treatment another field. also done month decided well coronavirus gone let’s open back fully. Wish stayed alternating shifts. guess what? people going get tested since we’re full capacity testing capacity ramped up, important contextualize results looking positivity rates hospitalization rates.

CA 1500 confirmed suspected ICU old incomplete estimate, CA 2800 ICU beds rate creeping up, definitely worrying, still TX FL 10% 80k+ tests/day, TX sporadic closer 40k, FL around 25k. Normalized tests/population, TX FL behind. 

More always better, relative CA, TX least 60k FL 40k.

EDIT: also highlight none ""good"", lesser shades ""bad""...from understand, people Cal giving 0 fks, SF seems taking seriously ppl wearing masks, etc.   problem length available for. Canada program got extended already likely extended unless SERIOUS second wave doubt happen (it'll happen curbed effectively think).

In US already lockdowns support lot states halfassed whole time. problem worse ever they'll either close let virus run rampant. whole damn point closing make big sacrifice economically curb virus US former without latter. gonna make us suffer

 Everything big Texas! Stop bullshit fear mongering. 99.74% survival rate.

Quit bullshit. 99.74% survival means .26% mortality rate, 120k deaths implies we've 46 million active cases United States far. really believe 330 million people, 46 million COVID we've noticed 2 million it? reality deaths likely even higher tracked well beginning, many 75k higher, would give us 75 million cases. know we're behind testing that's really hard believe, idiotic claim .26% mortality rate can't PROVE 46-75 million cases.

With data have, even double number cases, we're looking 3% mortality rate pretty freaking high virus could infect 80% population.  fair, anything smarter people Yeah sounds right ;-; Dude theres 0.2 mortality rate, like said yall need turn damn tvs. guys manipulated. Like said you’re scared stay you’re scared ass locked inside. Ill living life. Whenever anyone talks Covid19 mentions word ""constitutional"", roll eyes. Like fuck founding fathers pandemic-level infectious disease!? keep seeing people say flu season likely mildest flu season ages? I've never even heard social distancing 2020, seen someone wear mask. Hell, I've rarely ever even seen someone wash hands eating (during normal times). Sure, lots people complying safety guidelines. lot - way flu season I've ever witnessed, none ever thing all. disease prevention measures already happening months months time flu season hits, track really weak flu season? say double next month. Go! believe means going around total strangers without mask. thought family members okay.

This actually lot people Maryland thought meant. Probably incredibly selfish abhorrent thing do. humans dumb also really hard make small kids socially distance extended periods time. Maybe rethink whole thing. inviting grandparents. Note happened grandparents OP. ""milestone birthday"" look lot different rear view mirror someone dies it.

Your business, life, decision, definitely try illusions situation setting up. Americans say, ""have good one"" (puts smile). seriously, can't people least bit clever? China great job covering up, lying, killing citizens, restricting free speech, locking people homes.

Oh, reason keep different cities still spreading. Also, good job blaming everyone except themselves. norcal, almost one wears mask outside, 99% people wear one indoor spaces. missing guy allergies gives people COUGH! know sick, thought cough usual allergy related cough turned that!

So, reality, vast majority people 70 healthy, Covid19 concern. course get really sick may develop chronic problems, death table. 50 healthy odds dying drop around 1/30,000. healthy 30, 1/100,000. far Japan, one person 30 died, pre-existing heart condition.

""As British pilot garnered global attention, (nurses) felt stressed fear committing mistakes would affect country’s image,"" said Le Hong Tham, 28, working Intensive Care Unit Cho Ray Hospital HCMC.

Tham five years experience nursing assigned directly care pilot, referred ""Patient 91,"" since May 22 transferred hospital lung infection treatment declared free novel coronavirus. Alongside Tham, 11 others nurses, divided three shifts per day.

The 43-year-old British man worked national flag carrier Vietnam Airlines returned dead experiencing ""miraculous"" recovery.

The patient 1.8 tall weighs 88 kg, average female nurse weighs around 40 kg. Therefore, always two nurses room assisting pilot exercise perform physical therapy. Even patient sleeps, nurses required monitor status, without distraction.

""If patient shows abnormal signs nurse cannot timely detect, consequences could unimaginable,"" Tham said.

At beginning treatment Cho Ray, critical patient reliant extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and, relatives, physical emotional support nurses.

Tham said pilot probably memorable patient career. Due language cultural differences, caregivers went way ""pamper"" him.

After patient exited two-month coma, one biggest challenges proved Scottish accent, nurses found hard understand, fueling bad moods frequent scolding nurses.

""Knowing pain caused react like that, felt sympathetic also little sad,"" Tham recalled.

Tham actively studied English improve communication, times resorting Google Translate explain certain health details get know better.

Also telecommuting BLM (in US) expect white flight.

Few people realizing world look like 3 years, going significantly poorer, authoritarian, politically divided. China built huge testing capacity several cities, they're going send samples Beijing 100s miles south Guanzhou testing. would take long they're trying case management wide *and* fast. see article working contact chain every day, tracing testing, isolating positive cases.

In Wuhan, China multiple cases community transmission, goes goal *completely* eradicate COVID-19 within China. China, ""flatten curve"" means ZERO domestic cases. can't trace source, lock test find it, strong assurance burnt out.

But yeah, idea test Wuhan, certainly started guy wondering ""what could test *everyone* within single R cycle?"" national government said ""OK, make plan!"" cheap, showed well containment worked, cases really were; identified cases needed quarantine; demonstrated capability scale country done.

### 'Testing blitz'

The premier announced 'testing blitz' Melbourne's suburbs with highest number of community transmission cases, Keilor Downs and Broadmeadows, blitz extend suburbs Maidstone, Albanvale, Sunshine West, Hallam, Brunswick West, Fawkner, Reservoir, and Pakenham. 

""There will literally hundreds hundreds - indeed, entire team a thousand-strong - doorknockers out there, talking community, inviting come get free test, whether symptomatic or asymptomatic.""

He said testing blitz key containing virus. 1.6 million dead (50% infected 1% mortality) seems probable worst cast. Wearing mask, traveling, testing/isolating infected joining large gatherings seems bring transmission number 1. It’s rocket science. know now, it’s difficult. [Look wasn’t willful ignorance, original comment poorly written. explanation make sense, think person response would agree. original comment arrogant written toot fart “smoothbrains” comment screams “I live mom’s basement it’s everyone else’s fault.” Slow testing please 35% can't afford eat go lockdown. also think ever lockdown fucking dreaming Summer sure!

Wearing masks like easiest thing do. AMERICA DOOMED

.... I'm serious, country fucked Give couple weeks states seeing obscene infection numbers seeing obscene New York death numbers also. Takes little three weeks deaths start snowballing, since already seen play multiple times... time sounds reasonable lock down, it’s already late. I've sitting ass home like 3 months now, King country whatever. Well, wanted great something... I’m gladly take haha Fox isnt news though, theyve said themselves. there’s dark pun comment somewhere Get outta u come west Fuck NFL. Oh I'm glad Math people read reddit. “The expects obvious.” Damn, fucking moron. ""Worst surge"" 33.

Meanwhile expat Massachusetts, I'm happy they've cone 149 new cases Monday. know absolute certainty much better US's. No, according article neither went. also married doctor, said wife refused go party due safety reasons.

Wasn't guy's party all. He's interviewed parents sister hospitalized. :( Normal compassionate humans think stop masturbating thought millions people getting sick, dying, something. Agreed. Anything better nothing. I've seen guys grocery store wearing bandana bandit-style, figure, hey, that's gets cover up, I'm it. I’m mortgage loan officer seen tons properties within 10 years Cali/Colorado/Texas/VA gain well 200-300k. need 25% income property, closing costs. That’s even finding tenant. I’ve also seen rentals carry little positive net income mortgage paid. It’s hit miss you’re entirely wrong either. wanted throw two cents Good news! Trump kidding slowing testing moving end federal funding testing sites! OMG say Big Mac.... haven’t one long. definitely wait get use fmla, workman's comp, sick leave Goddamn buddy fuckin torched ass love it. Thank service Could bad news rocks? humans upset collapse goal? Wrong. 25%(!) stroke patients younger 52, would astonishing regular cohort stroke patients. normal non-COVID-19 IQR (the 52-69 range here) stroke patients 65yrs-80yrs. 25% IQR normal stroke cohort, 16% cohort 52yrs 65yrs, leaving 9% ordinarily 52 yrs (ordinarily majority 44 52.)

But now.. 3500 COVID-19 patient stroke cohort, instead 9% 52, **25% are!**

These incredibly young patients strokes, discussed doctor. I've actually enjoyed comments I've seen. Thanks bringing humor grim situation. jokes I’m permanent resident i’m US citizen. brought thinking i’d better life obviously ~American dream~ bull shit. move wherever want don’t want raise family here. Sadly true.

""Omg poor me, someone think meeee"" become rampant disease society post country want take use intricate words something ominous. Accept point, still learn something new.

Finding diplomatic term past lingua-franca pompous says comment attempting mock. I'm tired stories ""Oh god thought \[hoax/like flu/only old people\], got it. real people careful.

There end info bad dangerous... yet people wont wear mask throwing parties like this. 

No wonder set new daily record cases. Wait feel bad elderly people young people? keep Switzerland. US always one ""just look bad there"" places. idea bad virus is. looked terrifying start clue. I’m seeing open pits anymore patients floor hospitals cases back then. It’s like CoD WW2 train. keep thinking “this thing derailed minute, there’s way cars keep exploding tracks right front me” keep coming. It’s almost unrealistic. It’s almost funny. remember it’s train wreck playing lives political points. Really can’t powerlift home  majority legitimate medical reasons people wear masks nothing medical fragility. people ASD, PTSD, claustrophobia, like. people cannot breathe mask, people cannot remain calm wearing one. 200,000 dead election? More? America's Covid response slow motion train wreck. Gee, didn’t see one coming. Yeah, weren't. lying first started reading comment made think people said would go away heat summer. favorite thing say 'You know winter/early spring already summer/early fall southern hemisphere slowed there'. 'vaccine would ready month' explaining procedures happen create effective vaccine. Cases can't spike test people. Big brain plays. happen, people selfish self centered anything someone else tells do. many ways government lied manipulated pandemic reasons making hard trust say anymore. time people asses asses abusing ADA excuse. Maybe Darwinism grande scale weeding society refused listen reason   Wuhan mixture everything said. genuinely still plenty asymptomatic carriers city found required test go back work. 10-20 new cases asymptomatic carriers, people provinces/cities still wary people Wuhan, policies specifically targeted people Wuhan. importantly people Wuhan begun blame Central Government letting provinces/cities “discriminate” people Wuhan, I’d wager that’s ultimately led mandatory testing. countries East / Southeast Asia Oceania wouldn’t even register blip graph point! fucked situation living in. need work also want get sick risk family getting sick. Money safety? think ""been studying viruses centuries"" even know viruses existed century ago. personally convinced case 2 Missouri hairdressers worked symptomatic wore masks one got disease. Everything leads conclusion. It’s insane, ridiculous theory. Water clinging spinning ball?! reason believe everyone brainwashed belief system since birth reinforced every aspect society. start genuinely challenging belief system, crumbles like rotten house cards. 

If you’re ready challenge it, cognitive dissonance going force perceive crazy lunatic. won’t even awareness recognize though. people completely hypnotized. work Houston area hospital, end interact fellow coworkers, healthcare, care wearing mask correctly, matter. Several think hoax. Leadership nothing, took field hospitals weeks ago. look country workout home front centre reporting cherry picks certain mortalities. cancer / heart disease / car accidents? look shocking volunteer EMT, married doctor attend due safety concerns, still decided party. Come on... slow testing. can't case without test. Delaware here. Can’t get anywhere without mask. Check yesterday 2 day ago data: 

Back 800+ two days back back Probably means something like he's responsible bringing first aid kit local tee ball practice. think social distancing means? China 80.000 cases two months.
The USA two days. Also China five times many people USA How's sick leave look industry? Someone highly affected place coming family next couple days suspect might COVID flout travel restrictions mandatory home quarantine rules eat time. Also, one still soliciting times like these. elders house insisting stays place acting like uneducated baboons.

Can someone post set studies, links, infographic etc relates covid viral load difference body response (i.e. touching surface picking nose lowers viral load body responds differently breathing droplet filled air someone showing symptoms body fails there) studies showing difference inside outside transmissions. 

FFs please need quick help. people even wear masks operation New York sell plasma rest country? NY MAKE TAXES TRANSACTION? obviously paying attention one tell much risk is. Missouri infected barber lead new reported infections masks, whether thats true time TBD. ultimately decide whether want take risk not. forgot /s spent trillions defense yet can’t get people wear five dollar mask save millions American lives bought heul stockpile last year vitamins r/heul r/preppers great subs read. recent upswing looks even worse graph. one thing hear Texas set record, entirely different seeing quickly numbers increasing.  deaths up? see news everywhere reporting increased cases graph deaths could find looks like still decreasing. 

 “Reddit real life” anything?! 

Like... rapidly increasing number infections quantifiable thing. Many, many article sources throughout political spectrum, comments people refusing wear masks - that’s known phenomenon. 

Literally major country, possible exception Russia, shitting bed badly are. outlier, 4% world’s population 25% world’s Covid deaths. 

Reality real life, numbers unnerving hell. much people could blame Trump, sad fact graph really shows American population see entitled rest world think rights affected magical unique way bs countries. 

Case point, Floridians calling city councils members devil voting wearing face masks. today. 

Utterly utterly bonkers. Probably can't read it... Look president. Even though I'm sure role model... people refusing wear mask leadership following suit. leader country wearing one, says something people. That’s true. 


[School Children Don’t Spread Two things, first case Missouri two hairstylists worked 140  
 clients symptomatic wore masks one got sick. Masks work. Google hairdresser COVID-19 see details.

Second, asthma appear risk factor worse symptoms. fact, take inhaled corticosteriod \*might\* someone helpful get symptoms. 10 million still fraction total population people care happens them. ""A single death tragedy; million deaths statistic. ""  Dumb, false narrative Seems weird they’d in-person meetings it’s gonna minimal. Probably something said least little real world interaction though instead classes online. happens four test positive? Topping 117000 point. Apart lockdowns ended countries things gotten lot worse. countries everyone wears mask N95s rotate go stores.. cloth surgical masks getting food groceries delivered. Right I'm working home. go back (probably August) I'll wear mask day. going suck. ""getting showing pandemic family crazy suck possibly getting lung damage"" suck. suck.I'm wear cloth ones. watt wear N95 many hours.

Just empty stadiums..

We’re UK beloved football it’s better nothing considering
You know.. we’re pandemic Except folks believe Trump lies everything Finally tiny bit sanity. Control Karens. right thing do. going home school child...something never thought I'd do. answer: politics. 

Oh ya...and leader tippy top. Specific targeting particular minority group expressed intention exterminating including actively building complex mechanisms accomplish said purpose versus lazy negligence magical thinking. deaths 120,000 people versus deaths 10 million people. line thinking isn’t helpful. ends making Trump’s crimes look paltry comparison. Using Hitler Shoah shorthand every crime cheapens it. Cambodia, Rwanda, Bosnia, fair comparisons. Trump isn’t committing genocide doesn’t mean isn’t piece shit. Well older homes still lead paint. people eat paint chips. there's something water. mean, sounds like conspiracy theory, think national security problem caught it, try get advanced treatments? even took Hydroxychloroquine basically wim. seem far fetched he'd willing try UW vaccine plasma. least plan prepared handle infection president vice president. dumb start going gym? Theres gym near opened say never 10 people time, elementary school teacher figure already doomed anyway... come fall. stocks u recommend? I'm gal stays away, too. Meanwhile, rest family says ok visit grandma now, since live we're allowed socialize groups 6. fact grams living stage 3 heart failure stopped them, welcoming tiny apartment.

Uh, no.  
Covid-19 coronavirus, influenza strain. 
Coronaviruses mutate adapt like influenza.

Spanish Flu influenza. 
It mutated much, much stronger strain summer.  
So, no, follow course like Spanish Flu. follow course like SARS-CoV-1, first cousin. evidence pointing towards that. buy N95’s? Also, person saying volunteer EMT. One would hope someone healthcare adjacent field would bit sense. Yes, COVID-19 well, they're left dramatic effect guess. January me. Well, didn't.

I posted data shows percentages/per capita stats important totals. dawned Zoomers, perhaps most, actually old enough go nightclubs longer exclusively tween Minecraft/Fortnight players.  belong group decides presidential elections - Independent, i.e. partisan, vote along party lines. Dem 22 years, left 2010. vote people parties including big two. That's swing voter is. indies lean left, lean right, scared cross party lines. Well done sensible sticking yourself.

You right looking mum. I'm UK looking elderly mum medical issues too. one seems care carry like holiday.

Our government atrocious btw citizens majority selfish. medical professionals exhausted mental health destroyed.

Please go near idiot 2 weeks. pansy. Fing idiot. Whoa no. eugenics. I'm talking shit like urban farms advancements hydroponic farming. feed world relatively small amount ground space. grow farms vertically. also still build many parts world utilizing space efficiently. would mean moving people around reeducating world. say technologically socially right now.  don’t read US news clicking Fox News link say isn’t true. Coronavirus BLM things front page..... It’s definitely unicorn blood. Trump learned best tricks Lord Voldemort.  Cool. many people would unknowingly infect homicide died? neighbor died corona virus smacking tree 60 mph motorcycle. COVID fairly deliver bag coins death imaginary world? Leaders 😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂 fucking clown ass leaders 🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂 puppets🤣😂🤣😂 leaders, fools follow leaders 🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂 shit sad, last year everybody knew, government Illuminati controlled, 2020 everyone's like follow leaders... 😪😪😪😪😪 Praises high, almighty leader, he's control creation moving world, Psalms 83 judgement... grow victory garden makes lot sense me, seems quite possible, given feelings toward recent events. least case, I'm uncaring selfish asshole. Individuals fine, people whole fucking suck. easy lmfao! you’re stupid wear mask, wash hands stay home till there’s room hospitals. Yeah except wrong. ended lockdown, masks mandatory cases nearly back March/April levels. 

Israel, like look up. support airlines, can't specify that. told business comply local state orders, currently there's none.

Never mind fact deal airline pilots travelers every fucking day country. people business actually live staff, everybody else comes state plane. masks own. *literally* said this. Close eyes open haircut done. coming home, wash hands first, wash face soap. idiot! 400k nothing! example even mild case make impossible go diving due lung damage. negligent US proves handling this, ridiculous blaming Chinese negligence problems sounds Funny countries getting live without virus already. Must magic! look demographics dying like this:

healthy 30, one pink M&amp;M
healthy 5, three green M&amp;Ms
healthy 65, seven green M&amp;Ms

Unhealthy 70, 10,000 M&amp;Ms

Shake bowl take one randomly. virus know become mutate less contagious potent things? change all? chance? We’ll build new Tent City Fuck would love give card back karen thrusts laugh her.


Shriiiiiieeeeeeeeek!  China continue China. pandemic response stellar. risk sounding like 50 cent army, goes...

But leader wear masks everywhere goes. put top epidemiologist charge. sprung action early stage kept it. mobilized entire healthcare system support worst hit city/state (Wuhan). re-lockdown cases rises.

Can say US? ok. COVID cover Fox News soon. Yeah, that's said ""someday"". break smaller asreas fight there.

The issue size US willing populus comply. 

Germany (my place) lot smaller US still hate folks claim hoax.

&amp;#x200B;

But mayor selling point Germany US 2 fold me:

\- Healthcare

No one scared visit doc since could ruin him. Covid treatment set back 10-20€ total (Even ICU bad case) Also send quarantaine deal income loss (You need sick 6 weeks get amll income reduction)

\- Social security

Our jobs secure. cant fire worker like reason. unemployment rate may 6.3% (June yet published). social tool pay part wages company needs shut (Kurzarbeit) - thats partial slice (like 70%) income think New York fairly well shut stage. wonder Texas look like peak. seems like it’s used right purpose though.

With GOP, every accusation actually confession.  Bad reply answered question large window add new informations all. charity berlin gave us serious warning january 3, means many details virus spread time every leader able plan prepare. Well won’t letting ass Italy October. makes less popular owners GOP, want people ignore pandemic continue going work like nothing different. think probably old/suburban people may voted Trump reconsidering since dislike chaos right now. ones care (financial) situations less 'culture war' things, bothered racism all. Old people seem love Biden, least lot liked Clinton.

Apart could see portion fabled 'Obama-to-Trump' voters unsure vote for: working class people disappointed 8 years Obama voted Trump mainly jobs promise since Clinton offered little continuation Obama years work them. Although think group far smaller first one.  personal favourite Americans still describe “the greatest country world” - greatest exactly? Cuomo ignore problem maybe kill many humans possible. point let ‘er eat care. Higher ed screwed think real issue politicians scientists. prophet complex yet normally equipped basic understanding know work types situations. conjecture political posturing, examination evidence. declining grounds losing it.

Can't get declined never looked it. *taps head* love everyone collecting unemployment getting shit massive corporations walking away half trillion taxes. yea keep blaming Billy Joe street finally able pay bills. Hopefully work cafeteria...😷👎😬 Also make sense operate bring staff limited guests. 

Fun Fact: Disney actually guests staying hotels right now. Pools restaurants open. watched video Disney blogger travel agents describing like. seemed surreal. Fuck dude stop spreading misinformation Puts ahead colleagues said anything all. said opposite matter... If? listen Bobby Boucher! weedbro lore continues I'm 99% sure could support 4 compartments 5 got filled... someone binoculars... Eh I've worn p95 gave someone needed wear blue paper masks cloth ones little. significantly easier breathe p95 paper masks nearly panic attack difficult was. cloth masks better little help. Trust Texas heat part gets me. yeah agree health care workers lot servers mind jumped ones hear complaining along restaurant goers most.

Trust definitely wear mask time go spend time around others well. agree people wear uncomfortable pointing many Americans think. Especially Texas. Wow pandemic put final nail coffin American exceptionalism though clearly. Delete account, Time elect sheriff brain. 30 chance dying 1/100,000

Under 50 chance dying 1/30,000

Even 65 still pretty unlikely. old, male, obese, major preexisting condition, higher risk group. People three extremely high risk group.

If drive Volvo, never speed, wear seat belt, avoid driving bad weather, always check changing lanes, unlikely traffic accident. hand, speed motorcycle, weave lanes, wear helmet, organ donor soon enough. 

Risk assessment, thing, insurance companies pretty well. hamberders Boris. Damn Boris! WHO. Smashing news. Outstanding research. Cutting edge reporting. 

Wait, wait I'm good too. expect hit 11M soon after. woohooo man I'm good this. wait, I'm going blow minds this. expect prophetize amazing deduction skills science, may hit 12M hitting 11M. Maybe hits 13M well??? 

Who could've thought things man I'm amazing must superest brain world must charge something extremely important. surging Utah rn people seem give shit anymore  seems bit much. Covid bad, people certainly enough prevent spread, fatality rate anywhere near enough doom human race. We're talking million people dying BILLIONS, end world. Meanwhile, large parts world clearing up. post actually laughing loud. Cheers!🍻 getting numbers? I’m part either side that......how get this?

I’m part % Il praise soon actually says trump room, actually tries change narrative meekly worm question interviewer. allowed remove mask eating drinking.... basically.. change bars. Additionally over-tourism likely contributed rapid spread across globe manifestation arrogance self absorption. 

They likely heard plenty people pleading online saying thing - ""I take seriously WRONG real please careful oh god loved one dead/i'm sick"".

They heard exact warning, disregarded it, fuck anything personal opinions experiences. decide big deal, decide dumbass birthday party important scientists dumb nerds know they're talking about.

BUT - get sick real THEM.....and turn around spew public service announcement nothing stop them. surely peopel listen THEM, make real.

And next round people care, also self-absorbed. Wow. done 2 months ago, kidding? God... shows automoderater totally control needs thread stop using it. I’m really worried America atm, it’s going keep going up, UK ALOT things wrong however got paid lockdown one lost houses mortgage break one starved. Trump never give Americans luxury thing that's scary viral diseases people overlook, one numbers hit certain threshold increase infections goes rapidly control longer becomes containable. Also numbers double, quadruple matter days. hit say 20 million infections, expect 40 million 3-5 days. That's kind terrifying situation slowly approaching. don’t watch Fox News read headlines...? Please delete one too, mod.

Purely political I’m wondering restaurants operate. Take only? Mandatory masks means can’t walk one take eat right? first started reading comment made think people said would go away heat summer. favorite thing say 'You know winter/early spring already summer/early fall southern hemisphere slowed there'. 'vaccine would ready month' explaining procedures happen c

oh news: 

new researcher xy working vaccine. COULD ready xy month. 

cant stand thats wish realiable data. hell would that? call phone without standing outside window like weirdo. gonna lie! state seems pretty dumb! I'm sure what's worse. delusional mind fabricated idea getting light body kill infection. brain turned mush actuality attempting explain genuine medical technique capacity understand explain anything resembles requires complex abstract thinking. I'm sorry fuck talking about? I'm far fan Fox News page linked literally Coronavirus FIRST thing bar top page, ""U.S"", half inch right logo.  hairstyle? honestly never good haircut entire life hair super curly behaves different wet vs dry. 20 years lopsided haircuts started buzzing letting grow back. option you? I’ll honest feels really good also kind liberating. Yup Let’s make pay it! Uh, wearing mask does't protect death, avoids infecting people. *literally* choose KILLING losing comfort. Killing grandma cash. It’s sickening. people aged 45-55 omitted? ""Rent cancellations"" put legally viable. violates takings clause US constitution. Oswald Lucky Rabbit underappreciated. chance. See famous two weeks. School office workers often grouchy doesn’t surprise fought Mouse Mouse lost. that's feel, would work - Corona virus not? sounds like bullshit rule. get need make sub neutral objective possible, huge political issue many relevant decisions made politicians. inherently political topic. Trumps lies Covid:  hope man carries guilt rest life. fuckin' thinking?! that's works all. intercontinental play off.

I tried add interesting tid bit fun discussion insulting me. Thanks. Hahaha, except simple list things telling people months, lead ""don't 25 person gathering hours enclosed space, ESPECIALLY cancer patients octogenarians, ESPECIALLY actively symptomatic guest""

Like, story reads like family going way kill grandparents. Yes agree, tuned dr. Osterholm. honest know virus, spent whole life fighting infectious diseases.

It basically tells scary story rest year might pan out. Thanks posting Shocker. feeling want wait till big 4th July celebration easy want good career there. key factors want successful, need corrupt, zero ethical values, need respect human life, need stupid. values, hell, knows one day may make top.  Woooosh probably already late avoid hospitals overrun 3 weeks lag less overrun sooner happens lol  Yeah, statistically proven young ppl lower risk Thank great answer! appreciate it. you’re valuable economy home nothing actually work 40 hours week, lmao that’s good thing get work. think bad now? economic collapse result way deaths long term problems I’m pretty sure actually them. Scattering ashes Bay Lake, sort thing. Probably package deal whole family. Praise right thing? Ummmm.. enough military stop millions people. people really wanted could storm white house. sheer number 1 million could stopped. shoot every person. Ducey dummy Among things: Plastic bags. Like garbage bags Ziploc bags. realize useful plastic bags can't get them. USA! USA! USA! Trump working harder kill Americans Al-Qaeda Isis ever did. Yeah, family member lives US slightest inconvenience really gets her.

In years, changed that.. people lived lives. Don’t give Celebration ideas... Texas Medical Center reports 97% ICU capacity less 12 days, unless something magically happens people recover quickly leave ICU, entire Houston area medical center beds staff. see becoming lot less 12 days next week (6/28 - 7/4) , nation going get slammed case reporting protests/riots going on. state run virus Shimps fault politicizing it? They’re starting force us unemployment go job searches lose benefits. things is, jobs hiring essential services due respect don’t want virus want get conspiracy theorist like he's intentionally fuck response this. Literally good response pandemic would made reelection slam dunk done deal him, finally big victory hang hat on. Instead constantly made bad calls, shifted responsibility, seems going way sabotage response every turn.

Either get reelected absolutely miserable POTUS certain class people lot benefit hundred thousand less people collecting social security benefits next years. Well one hell surprise indeed. majority wearing mask protects everyone else....  keep forgetting schools probably going reopen. can’t get grown adults wear mask, hell can’t even get president nation wear masks, kids going run around spreading like wildfire couple months asymptomatic. though everyone best stay socially distant

Did see photo? Surprise motha fucka Oh yeah like can't shit he's getting away front world. Czech here. wear outside several months. week gettting rid them.

Finally. know actual truth something people wanna hear. really, *convenient* believe says every exactly right DNA, despite IQ tests, organ donations, pharmacology, etc telling us otherwise. talk *non-scientific*….if there's anyone denying science you, me. good know sides saying. sides valid, important know opposition thinks. Opposition probably right word; we're theoretically team. Would nice everyone know understand said, implied, many refuse believe hear it; choose believe everything hear mainstream media talking heads, social media propaganda posters, even wrong.

The media really maybe stick reporting statistics (although misinterpret lot, use chart misconceptions spreads misinformation) keeping everyone updated latest social restrictions, airing official public health statements direct professionals, etc., etc. media also stop writing op-eds virus political arena. Tell 120k+ whose bodies, along aid modern medicine, figure out.

Tell bereaved. Tell maimed complications. MEMBER THE_DONALD CAUSE THOUGHT HILARIOUS JOKE! almost like leaders care lives economy. staying power. still make money recession

almost? wake up.... Trump said wants reopen cruises week ago. 

Anyone stupid enough book cruise right deserves trapped cruise ship Covid. mountains Midwest?... question. Lol Kyrie? Unemployment + Cares Act. Temporarily furloughed company taking back end July. far summer hasn’t bad past summers. Low 90s/upper 80s least Dallas. Better triple digits Disneyland's gonna switch revenue model charging $500,000 per ticket marketing heavily oil princes. take moment remember President United States Fauci said Americans need wear masks. fucking absurdly stupid that? ended early, never things control, put together infrastructure things needed safely re-open (rapid widespread testing + contact tracing).

This total failure, unfortunately think square one -* think we're much worse position started. thing happened US 1918 post-reopening caseload/mortality much higher. It’s little complicated that. state government Disney balls want to. Remember entire Disney world resort operates iffy agreement called Reedy Creek Improvement District gets tremendous tax breaks since grandfathered in. nephew one unknowingly infected, thinking slight cough byproduct working construction.   infected two young children, two grandparents, cancer patient Barbosa's parents, 80s.   hospitalized: Barbosa's parents Frank Carole, along sister Kathy, battling breast cancer. 

I thinking visiting parents one last time mid March decided risky, felt fine then. can't imagine slight persistent cough playing Russian Roulette good chunk extended family. Shutdowns happen again, Americans refuse mask, wash, distance. one woman whining *needed* go vacation escape last three months. Bc sitting home every modern convenience horrible. 

Stay fuck home! creepy guys? I've started demanding 100k paid it. wanna pay nose, might consider. became seriously, visibly ill 

Mike Pence: Trump feeling hot, I'm taking bit... he's farm north play presidents. Jim Mattis honestly imho one ,if the, greatest American alive today. Basically modern day George Washington personality wise, minus slaves obv. Stoicism, rationality, patriotism, respect greatly San Diego here. hit daily highest since started today 332

We consistent 120s-130s last couple months 300+ last 4 days Least favored Senator perhaps. think reddit begrudging kind respect Rubio. Reddit (rightfully) utterly despises McConnell 4 months. thing already getting America February know also puts everyone else danger..... contracts it! Karma. fair question. example, late March/early April NY went hard testing posting wild daily case increases. Yes spreading quickly, also increased testing capturing people infected earlier, like every days numbers brand new infections, brand new test results. 

But answer question, several ways know.

One key measures, positive rate per test. Say state ability 1000 tests day. Rationally would test sever, admitted hospital cases doctors already pretty sure it, positivity rate really high, let's say 50%. 

Then let's say state ramps testing capacity 10,000 tests per day. point, probably many critical cases, expand testing less obvious cases. people milder symptoms, people symptoms possible exposure confirmed case, etc. positive results less common, let's say 25%. 

Basically, things equal expect tests = lower chance particular test result positive.

What seeing states surging testing least before, positive results percentage shooting up. That's good sign, means case numbers going testing wide spread.

This confirmed metrics dependent number tests administered. Hospitalizations/ICU capacity, deaths, etc.

In Florida, Arizona, Texas, California least, metrics paint clear picture matter testing more, things really getting ugly fast. also report people infected surfaces alone, food delivery  really hate thinking like conspiracy theorist

Thing is, though, youre right. GOP definitely said. That's one fucked-up things Trump presidency. shit sounds like nutjob conspiracy theory, except fact 100% true. sound like lying speak truth President. 

Fuck, scary. Remember shocked reports said could see 20K day? moron. Trump isn’t racist. Hillary Clinton stealing tons money Haiti is. 


You sheep. hope things get renewed, I'll glad see $600 bonus replaced something actually helps stuck working everyday. many people making less working unemployed risking getting virus. Add social divide seen seemed misguided. giving money everyone making threshold, unemployed. person make unemployed working one month earlier. disable javascript chrome addon. works every time bypass paywalls. basically said airport suddenly became inoperable, would shame. /s I've wearing one well. like it, uncomfortable makes bridge nose hurt...but I'd rather wear one couple hours shopping potentially get sick make others sick. I'm thankful people wear one day work. 

Meanwhile governor NC announced mandatory mask wearing family back home mad. know going wear either I'm afraid spike new cases one get sick. Must Easter then! even throwing cash it. trump simply told people start wearing masks every day, least two weeks really reiterate it, would cost nothing brief embarrassment good country lol. 36 k 4k Switzerland got - whole period since February, affected country (infected per habitant ) long period.... countries stopped spread, we? Must Airdrie. mom use right headline, fuck's sake. long going keep removing adding flairs?, I've seen ""good news"" one removed least 4 times absolutely don't, let learn example.

They're clearly willing die cult, let I'm glad kiddo better! guess I'm infuriated little teachers seem count conversations....like... Teachers sick kids risk people home too. think major strikes likely dont make masks mandatory wise significant bargaining power people educate country's youth. economy cannot get moving without us. (This directed course, general stupidity situation.) Yep, I'm NM, too, definitely keeping uneasy eye AZ TX. Houston, problem. Number excess deaths Brazil 38%, lower UK, Italy Spain.
Source: Learn code bro tippy cup fall over? shortages even health care professional would’ve made worse. One become senior campaign manager next month sure keep jumping things like this, mask shortages issue easily homemade. don’t cotton polyester shortage worldwide we? Oh look, one feels like information butler. shocking. Live Vietnam n95 masks available everywhere people wore cloth masks surgical mask.

More foreigners seemed wearing locals. 87% hospital beds filled Houston due virus. rural arent going extend cares act dont think. lot people hate discourages people return work unemployment rate big part election. might see another stimulus though Keep mind worldometers resets midnight Zulu, unlike data reported states. true thought wearing masks last option. Rubio talking sense? What? Lmao dude don’t pretend like know anything genetics biology Haha Benton-Franklin board commissioners responsible community’s 130 new cases today full hospitals. Vote Justin Raffa Benton County neighbors. Get local, get mad. good parasite kill host quickly. Given best available estimate IFR age group, probably looking 3.8 million excess deaths US maybe 90-100 million excess deaths worldwide (depending complexities least developed nations) enough people acquired immunity recovery rate exceed growth rate worldwide, assuming never find cure, vaccine therapeutic intervention reduces fatality.

 I’m confident find one things, it’s gonna take us lot longer. staying locked delaying long possible. There’s reason couldn’t done New Zealand even strictly. Thanks saying thinking... Wait, Walmart girls!? )) wouldn’t count vaccine big decision, honestly. Vaccines case could cause immune response could worse virus. enough testing years research. Could late 2021 even later come one. Perffuckt They'll end w/ damaged lungs, chronic fatigue, potentially worse. death need worry about. Smart. ""good thing"" death rate low.  Go, lemmings, go.  parents told daddy Australian loves mommy tiger.... disingenuous way anti-vaxxers nuts tell ""stay informed"". everyone symptoms.  Healthy people far less risk. really lineup risk life Tell salon device run business. 

Again point loophole tested. evidence thus far protests lead spike cases. tell far, get it, there's lower chance it'll severe.

Oh yeah, planet? 
Come r/covid19positive see well we're doing. 28M here, virus taken easily. 3+ months ongoing symptoms, still fully normal yet. California We've 102,000 cases Canada total since thing started. fact guys exceed three days terrifying. KY 3.8% deaths compared total infected. /r/SelfAwarewolves Can't deny constitutional right unobstructed breathing! first thought, ""wait, 180k died"" realized ***180 thousand die*** sounds like New York March.

Disney think could board everyone day California said could announced date ten days later Omg yes! might really suck kids. thing would liked seen past 3 months: 

The US crushing testing targets across 50 states %positive test rate 1%.  Functional contact tracing. Proactive workplace testing. Random population sampling.  Universal mask usage.  large gatherings effectively beaten thing remission.

What *don't* want different rationalization every week ignore thing. Excellent! Thank you! Agh biggest fear. company switched remote March wanting start getting people end July. Agh...why? It’s posted many times last weeks, it’s start. entitled people history planet. better world. Youre clueless  United States freedom movement. Currently DOJ challenging Hawaii governor order requires thing determined likely Hustle. jobs always covers make real money. There's money there. Hustle. Haha republican bad

Also sub *reaaaaaaally* hates Mitch particular oh god I’m sayin facts, lol. racist? Ideologically?

The biggest anti-Trump voice right Lincoln Project, they're conservatives.

Removing Trump office ideology. removing clear present danger society. /thread agree thought process, could easily flipped: don’t want risk getting infected, don’t go out. Steak cut bacon difference statistically different less severe cases given survival rates. study pilot. cannot draw conclusion P value 0.14 unless they've suffered sort COVID-related brain damage.

Thanks NY Times another BS piece. Wait full study.  didn’t read assume got via wearing masks lol? get mask on, reduce risk zero would like people wear masks, wash hands, social distance. Yep! I’ve resigned fact idea happen; everything standard change time year. What? make BANK unemployment right now. many based quickly spreading. brainier. Fuck economy. cant refute shit cover it. Fox always done that. Stop playing games Foxnews/Trump/etc. They're endangering rest us talking this. Meh... see lot blue voting retards nation wide peotests / riots.. they're spreading same.

I DC every day Whitehouse.. wearing masks. want see life resume. want see young get lives futures back track.

Everyone would like see happen?

I think way Germany handling outbreak gold standard. dealt terrible hand got virus control testing/tracking lockdowns. 

Their economy going take less hit US fewer people die. 100% serious.

Then need learn stuff understand they're nowhere even close herd immunity.  Sweden attempted path many months far they're nowhere even close. #Wow. cow made butter. can't think single place US said well. NY well now, obviously before.

Illinois doesn’t loves thems sum pork. Bacon especially. IKR, steady hand that's all. Wartime presidents win elections saying 'go team!'. Hell bush started 2 everyone hated won! imagine Bevin this? Maybe racist... Occupancy limits based fire codes fast people evacuate building emergency. Every building open public entry US defined maximum occupancy. public accommodations like restaurants, there's usually sign near entrance stating number. Whether posted not, I'd surprised UK similar requirements developed nation. gave fast, people sure ever trying first place... Mfw large investment HIV/AIDS research help public, rid market problem select few. researchers hired/promoted based (often familial) connections others Industry invested continuation supply. 

Those researchers jumping COVID problem. see big picture Germs real thing, can't see therefore real. 


Oh lord. 34000+

so beat 4 fucking thousand. true American way aren’t alone. I’m talking lot people (myself included) seriously sick selfishness. Even complicated fact people care about, yet blatant disregard disgusts me. don’t solution... wanted let know still us part you, even though paths likely never cross. won’t last forever. get it.   hard Americans see actions might impact others heads firmly asses. quarter million dead, Donald Trump. watch. procedures I’ve seen would fall apart 3 minutes don’t staffing make possible/enforceable. know, certain people begin think never like anything say.

Then pops up. pill could take guarantee prevention coronavirus people would trample black friday style get “personally” enough lol shopping retail eating restaurants become people’s lives?

Ah yes, two things people outside homes. i'm guessing september realistic deadline then? confirm raising baby right fucking nightmare. Can't anyone come help drop kid anyone unless everyone involved including baby properly tested first, good luck that. take every conceivable precaution since kids immune. goddamn clue bad long-term effects are. 

Every trip outside potential cripple child life, maddening hard get family understand thing goes visits. like grandparent going keep distance. grandparent exposed, baby exposed, parents exposed.

Top spouse follow precautions without constant oversight headed nervous breakdown. Also maybe literal breakdown insides. almost every state spikes reopening...

God`s Gonna Cut lyrics © Universal Music Corp., Song Cash Music would much better children home FYI it’s “laissez-faire”!

FYI overused word 2020 Stand boss then, bitch. never touted miracle treatment. Luckily we're fine. kids, 8,4 &lt;1 low grade fever 2-3 weeks, plenty energy appetite. dad sick time chest pain, shortness breath major fatigue, energy started coming back 2 weeks, chest pain lingered 2 weeks. husband handled better cough weeks, little chest pain. 

My mom hit hardest, shortness breath chest pain lasted weeks longer ours, blood pressure suddenly skyrocketed. monitoring several months due family history always lower end normal. got dangerously high 3 times 3 months later still bp meds. please cite $2tn corporate bailouts instead went working class afford stay home could really driven spread. fucking shit show. 37 here, moved back parents 5 years ago. I'm single, interested dating, work home. US needs get used multi generations living together... wages economy be. Theres nothing wrong it. nice. 

My grandmother, 91, also lives us. help spread load caring her. became debt free 2 years helped parents needs. Like huge chunk towards building small retirement home.

... Anyway, stay safe! ""PLEASE"" Exactly this. love life. major things grand societal level wish would change day day life doesnt issues. thought herd immunity 15% ""Many teachers may die sacrifice willing make."" Yep. bad shutdown means needing shutdown longer... everyone started early time respectfully, got start economy faster Isn’t congress on, going on, recess? Hawaii law challenged, might stand long.  Bexauae see nature still close Walmart scooty poots.  Q Continum obviously. Qs fault. I'm surprised. Donald Trump probably Q Jfc someone link scientific evidence showing efficacy cloth face masks?

Everything I've seen shows opposite yet continues perpetuated fix-all solution. realize different financial situations many us actually fine enough child this. People right child without guilting them. What, listening science facts, empathy fellow humans, self-centered prick? GOP’s norms sure. know, source said US deaths would zero June 1.

They might tad optimistic. Considering current number case uptrend estimate rather good 3 months now. Also dislike Fox News least mobile grim milestone right top. going upset distort news responsibility unbiased facts. Otherwise we’re bad stop complaining. Fire him. CDC said really even need wash grocery items. Google. Mark Rubio still alive? one tiny hands? citizen America

we care. Big family definitely makes harder, mostly it’s carelessness I’ve seen. don’t like wear masks(some couldn’t afford surgical masks)and simply don’t want stay inside. dare bring BLM protesters thread Rushing studies unsafe. Millions??????  logic fine people wearing seat belt. life, choice , seat belt!!!! Imagine December &amp; January look like Trump loses goes scorched Earth us. still need vote think use coronavirus punish us so. Fucking morons. worries man Trump told everyone test less less reported cases. Im marine biologist think maths out. national total cases since beginning coronavirus Japan (The U.S. population twice size Japan) 18,100 cases -- less half single day U.S.

How even possible?? California smart 100% considered buying tickets, lmao. world sucks right now, Star Wars ride would bring level happiness experienced since 2018. going stick us though play teacher guilt. . taken year off. .  mean... kinda ngl. go lot places safely including restaurants social spots. ""What do"" stay home order. Uhh...

First all: Wait two months. US numbers way worse anything Europe has.

Second all: epicenter Italy. seen truly global pandemic scale years. Italy hit first. America hit first, would already seen million deaths. Easily.

Look situation Italy though... control. control US? can’t imagine point. alot major concerns, love life feel like could give child good life well. things suck day day life great wife's family. UBI lose workforce people wanting work, think overall productivity gain would enough offset it. 

With UBI people would able experiment try find something enjoy adept at. Hobbies turning real jobs even freedom move jobs current one good fit. People tend get far better put effort things they're passionate about.   Don’t worry trickle down..... day wages slaves need daycare. Na...just need 200 dollars go straight trump Yeah take long get there. right black lives matter stuff. Looks like page advice people increased risk complications. mutations mean stable noticable mutations right? Becaus ei feel like 20 pretty low dealing trillions cells chance mutate somewhere billions(i may off). Either way though thats pretty insane. numbers gonna go people become hosts right? that's get. abandoned that, flock Trump same. What's logic there? evidence protests. reopening family gatherings. science shows indoors people means death. dumbass told boss dont give fuck thinks said doesnt believe N95 masks effect anyways everyone might aswell go life usual..
Totally unlike me. Luckily hes got thick skin, doubt happy thought spoke. Hopefully destroys people caused problems first place less people trying safe. Unfortunately, trying safe simply live world deniers created. let's hope problem people either learn lesson final lesson, can't fix otherwise. Cant start rumor ""libs"" dont want Trump people wear masks die Trump lose. . make fucking morons wear mask? Covid? Tucker told total hoax. Sean told like Flu. would bother covering flu? Laura Ingraham told mention Covid part conspiracy, turned bat flew away. argue woman, clearly 10,000 year old vampire? lunatics seem confined good ‘ol Pennsyltucky. 

Governor Wolf perfect, governor has. given unprecedented nature pandemic, think he’s done damn good job thus far. Might true, states drove lot Fox views increasing cases ICU beds fill they’ll eventually something. Wot. That's deaths province Yes, exactly hate idea herd immunity letting virus infect whoever. We’re getting better fighting it. Lewis County Florida WA. called hypochondriac myself. 

When over, three types people: overcautious, lucky, dead.

I'm going first group.

Fuck morons. Nothing protests. masks? Ok.. start mandatory masks Friday. . . three weeks numbers start dropping again. . . looking July 17th numbers drop. . said like 4 months ago, LOL!!!! every day hear town non-local setting.

RIP kid :( NY allowed ultrasounds. I've everyone husband (do need wear mask). cant go appointments though masks people using right aren’t ones medical community uses. Could’ve said, look masks work need medical community, here’s make one. Would’ve easier transition proper masks (because sadly they’re sooo much effective makeshift masks) supply available. Could’ve easily avoided protests whole thing becoming political. trusting people sure fire way make people lose confidence mention much spread could’ve prevented, turn would’ve reduced hospitalizations, turn would’ve reduced risk frontline workers. can’t imagine stressful situation you. shouldn’t go this, hope you’re able get better protection support soon. It’s awful see what’s happening Texas, I’m angry behalf healthcare essential workers bear consequences people’s stupidity. Hello, seems run number sub! Perhaps sensitive possibilities inclination aware Covid that. 

It's true, really like saying mine disability - partially fully accepted I'm disabled (only diagnosed late last year) also mine treatment leaves constantly exhausted brain fog, anything leaves physically mentally incapable things. 

But definitely use tell people want ""mild"" case Covid could still longer 3 months cause neurological damage drastically affect lives like mine did. shame people pretending disability wearing mask people actual disabilities capable wearing one number reasons. crap hits fan, cases deaths start escalating mainland, neighboring states assist resources providing supplies medical professionals assist taking patients in. Hawaii alone middle nowhere. Hawaii suffers emergency situation, screwed. Pretty sure people talking fact. Lots people couples forced quarantine together. end it, half married half split. Factor delayed babies due recession could little bump. vast majority people arent wearing masks stopped listening paying attention weeks ago. told wanted hear( people like Fauci, surgeon general, POTUS, others). masks werent necessary shouldnt wear them. *no* repairing damage thats already done. 

Unless massive campaign reinform entirety public, including POTUS saying wrong leading example wearing damn mask. Even doubt people would it, would call tyranny rights. 

This problem US long subsided places world. screwed issue masks, also proper/adequate testing. People like Rubio realizing best do? enough. going tricky US, sure. read Hawaii seems ok way. manage track rule breakers. 

It tougher us mainland we'll trust humans honor system. yeah. tough enforce anywhere without tracing app. 

At least, honest visitors, r/NJ community, courteous enough follow quarantine ask necessary questions. Seriously. going take years clean mess. believe specifically said healthy people need wear masks, save virus. yea everyone wore masks, sick people spread way. makes sense since people symptoms even though virus.

Don't say defend selfish idiots though, please. Median age infected Florida dropped 30 years since March. 65 v 35. It’s hitting younger/healthier population. I’m sure lot it. 老是钓鱼，真过分(´･㉨･`) proven? There’s still little official information people getting sick USA! USA! USA! really wish could stay away work going longer. months isolating went trip days stuck mountains rarely went town. mask.

Still area begin riskiest thing done good bit lol. oh god.

Anyways months  practice shoved drain I'm forced go back work everyone super irresponsible. Im seriously depressed town live wish chance get soon Hey there. Canadian followed US news little bit.

I clicked story case rate/death rate ration seemed high. 

What's story here? killer job treatment keep people alive? recent spike death rate climb lagging indicator? rate serious cases testing finding asymptomatic carriers? exactly need police officers education high school diploma. understand resentment also read lines see point view. Medical professionals needed supplies, general public midst massive panic buying profiteering China already bought global supplies months prior forbidden export masks. good situation all. 

Many people even know correct protocol actually using masks either, want feeling invulnerability put guard. Caucasians age faster. 3k? gives hope November voting even truly make difference? long puppets running office corporations always ones actually charge. isnt giving ultrasounds? wife appointments NY State ultrasounds able go see (I stay waiting room regular appointments). even march April New York hotbed ton guidelines Neither. 180k deaths literally much compared total U.S. population. country (and world whole) already overpopulated; replacing 180k take long. know many people really struggling now. hope everything goes smooth get back soon. People screaming bars opened up, screamed co workers ""wearing bullshit"" pointing mask, fuck load service industry staff town sick. banning visits.  Canada's handling things pretty well, join in? Fuck that, everyone wear mask. Yeah get date check please weird Facebook people equate fear wearing mask. Sally Im fucking asshole want Grandma live. May ask field is? sad. many people dead.  population great job (so far) flattened curve bent way. took couple months things reopened, people mostly safe still part. Lots people wear masks here, lots people needed sign little push back one said that. NY blue state first state got thrashed covid *most* reliable. Community. Online. Okay? Hear that, folks? reliable. It's, anyone tell you, best. Period. Lock up! 

FTFY  have

buddy Let's split hairs. difference calculated negligent mass homicide genocide? enforced — Socially. 

Stores refuse sale someone isn’t wearing mask. business right refuse sale, based laws &amp; regulations. becomes law, whether temporary permanent, businesses empowered include requirement customers. Yesterday higher last week, today 1 less. 7-day average flat likely start rise next days/week. IFR flawed measure highly dependent age distribution population. Areas older population hit potentmultiple orders magnitude harder areas younger population. 

Saying hardest-hit areas New York exceeded 0.26% really saying much all. draw box around retirement home, go ""my god, IFR 25%! estimate two orders magnitude!"" 

I say minimize loss elders. using IFR general measure deeply irrecoverably flawed virus. love first thought upon waking 103 degree fever ""ooh man think I've got flu"". fucking dense? Sign TF up, business boomed hate people deal them. shame. good person. pay rent. always lived parents. willing messenger message know wrong?

Show citation number CDC. Really, show me.

At best, find projection use it. projection cite source number - meaning value pulled thin air give value. could equally used 0.01% 25%. fuck that’s why. problem mask wearing become highly politicized. agendas cause biased opinions matter. 

I'm curious ""agenda"" think pushed healthcare professionals encouraging populace wear true test, best way uncover truth protective qualities masks dig pre-covid literature find unbiased studies.

There many things unpack here. First all, think scientist spent 8 10 years post-secondary education labor days, weeks, possibly months lab order participate kind overarching conspiracy fabricate data Big Mask, highly recommend reach mental healthcare professional soon possible. I'm even certain goal think educated scientist would working well-being society widespread pandemic; actually think coordinated response global scientists get political enemies, again, bid complete sincerity get mental health checked out.

Putting aside, wearing masks largely controversial politicized concept US. Countries outside US conducted studies effectiveness masks post-pandemic, unless also think international scientists performed studies order create false narratives attack political parties foreign that, simply won’t find anything suggests wearing masks protects people public.

This true. massively misinformed. think adjust amount time evidently spend internet reading politics conspiracy theories invest time instead educating public health. Colorado tourist. Actively flights booked fly tomorrow Denver Orlando weekend. Plans including beach, outside restaurants, Universal.

Following reading case count horror stories past week, since cancelled trip. sad,but took chance. story read every person world,perfect example. It’s mandated state wide based guidelines 

Other time suppose distance learning means instruction even cash either lol Already slightly US deaths World War 1. Passed Korea+Vietnam combined little back. ""Everyone wash hands.”  It’s simple hurts explain you. original argument younger patients Covid 19 strokes. proceeded post study 3500+ victims strokes studied. studied stroke age 52. That’s fucking young fucking idiot. life expectancy America 78.5 years! 52 literally 26 years younger that’s fucking low end. STOP MOVING GOALPOSTS FUCKING IDIOT. I’m sick tired dealing uneducated people like you. posted 2 articles site dissected both. Learn read stop embarrassing yourself. seems making assumptions, spikes holidays (4th July coming up) national level events (extra $600 unemployment benefits running July schools starting August). conversely, national stay home movement dramatically decreases spread. understand word saying. *“Even democratically elected governments fighting pandemic amassing emergency powers restrict human rights enhance state surveillance without regard legal constraints (or) parliamentary oversight.”* Yep, world going really want Americans moving in... believe options destinations going quite limited time. could one bad apple, blame whole tree  guess 180, 000 Americans die coronavirus October 1st. lot Americans literally dumb live. absolutely right. constant travel 2 cities. wanted clarify headline vague. next week; probably Tuesday Wednesday. There's clear cycle week fewer places seek report weekends, Saturday - Monday artificially low. really reporting weekly numbers rather daily numbers. Remember, flu! 

-- plenty people know  Exactly, amazing cases spike really high say ""oh we're testing more."" shity fucking response Exactly. bullshit. Absolutely bullshit. people blessed big paid break crying go back already like...ARE SERIOUS MONTHS MAKING TRIPLE MADE WORK, SHUT ANF GO BACK.  like one gives single crap risk health pennies, talking unsafe go back lol.  Fuck government helping us out. understand hate doomsday person. Maybe see far distance? It’s tough, worth risk. unfortunate. Good luck move! ah, found dreamer get people take pandemic seriously leader country refuses mask up, refuses accept responsibility, refuses spend billions allocated COVID-19 testing(look up), muzzled medical professionals, seeking stop limited testing have, on. 

I'm exhausted. I'm heartbroken country. I'm angry! feel betrayed let down. 

Land free....home brave......really? right now. see many ignorant selfish people can't come together historical time need. United stand? Divided fall? one????? president impervious shit? I've got beat couple decades! loved lockdown traffic fumes, less noise, fewer people avoid walked puppy Nobody Houston showing care whatsoever JFC. surprise! Btw, family, we're Barbosas. college degree professional job. mindblowing.

Degree common sense always align. group projects college wondered even there. family money find way too. really sucks elderly mom got since said stayed distanced everyone porch. dang yall, 25 people? One kids milestone birthday we've invited 4 people, grandparents aunt. outside everyone masked can't distance. fucking sucks now. There's 190 days left year, we'd need average ~2.5K deaths every day hit 600K. reference, 5 days 2.5K worse peak. see figure highly unlikely. [RANT INCOMING]

I've living earth 21 years every single female met within life, would say whopping 5% ever wanted kids. Almost every single female classmate/friend/coworker/aquantince ever spoken expressed extreme disinterest, sometimes even disgust idea ever starting family, child own. understand bc right funds feeling able start family, lot people met choose abstain sort thing bc hate kids refuse even consider anything like that. anyone asks, yes know proper age range start family yet (I wasnt planning anytime yet lol), people told final decision life, amount aging changing sway that.

I've wanted life dad someone I'm starting believe ever want get married love I'll bite bullet one day accept fact I'll never bring children world, matter much want to. cant afford picky want date forever, one days might end children wife family whatsoever. know theres prospect adoption, totally fine (I'd love adopt child really), would love nothing life bring child world raise ground up. know total boomer way thinking, feel I'll always feel.

One additional note: yes bi, yes would totally marry guy, would either A: accept simply isnt possible child relationship (biological reasoning much acceptable ""I dun wanna""), either adopt move on, B: get surrogate mother help out. thought ahead yes.

TL;DR: want kid barely met anyone entire life would want start family sucks ass Fibrosis lungs great vocal career. Viral neuropathies arthritis really color way instrument played, too.

Speaking classical pianist developed meningitis covid.

Oh, meningitis cause deafness, too.

These people fools. idea got that. Everything I've seen suggests herd immunity somewhere 45 55%  tough US makes political. pretty simple listen scientists. replies removed time due political. Yeah still unclear exactly goes class important details know stories guy wears skirt protest air conditioning offices? People start walking around public without pants, holding signs satirize anti mask signs. went gym everyone kept taking masks off. asked refund... That's wild. serious would laughable. Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Ok love Rubio thought clarifying go ""positive hospitalized"" Florida even though hospitalized Covid. could matter trying infer testing right people hospitalized number example. whoever charge fuse box owns Dallas way better weather Houston. Tossing number going ""all models wrong anyway"" really reasonable approach. 

The scientific approach -- one _does currently support_ hypothesis 300k deaths September almost factor 2 -- incorporate new information time goes on. that's thing tossing guess based opinion. 

If people going spread fear, least let fear grounded reality. Duh! economy survives people wear masks! paying attention science?!?!? Fucking dolt. people too? I'll give hint: people countries getting really really tired bullshit Americans particular persuasion shitting mouths days. We're becoming less less inclined shake heads make polite murmers. perfect world everybody would really nice look one another, fourth, who's say perfect world really is? perfect world relation what?

No one asking perfect world. asking PEACEFUL world. WTF baby almost 5 months. grocery store since beginning february light blanket covering him.  met people family know sure cautious me. imagine bringing rally like mask. :( Rubio also weak illegals course looks bad age Trump Wall Anything west/south/east Minnesota Florida Midwest. Woody Harrelson played dad Country Old Men, something like that. talking ones furloughed, get months paid go back (bitching whole time going back mind you). dude, basically everyone know. happy fuck getting paid 600$ week nothing 4 months. Even customers would let know lmao. know hurts us.... extra people cramming place employment everyday boredom extra chance get sick. yeah, fuck people. Stay home getting paid so, bruh. wrong since started. 

And therefore country open country allow transparency. Thus US fucked. might little bit easier read Trump close anybody. Rubio also weak illegals bad optics him. seems partly blame keeping wraps. 

But still hard time believing intelligence it. mean, know people started preparing early January. citizens enough information think going be... least, rough, early, virtually real action 2 3 months? add up. wait till tomorrow. Exponential growth motherfucker. quarantine 14 days festival, what's big deal? aunt says she’s cases mom tested positive covid, baby negative. cases, it’s inhumane separate them. Though suck. Ah, get it...World Health Organization (WHO). Dead people dont vote tho. mean I've wearing mask months staying home much possible. Abbott needs step  long don’t believe anything don’t care. don’t go fly airplane. do, thanks  Seriously? 8 hours week going school? That's wild, I'm honestly pretty surprised that. statewide? think Detroit Free Press' main goal say uptick happening. link found local newspaper near county jump farm worker way death this. end scale 300k. back envelope calculation USA alone 300 million inhabitants 3 million death year. assuming ages equally probable life expectancy 100 years. assumption wrong, wrong. go, plenty evidence. antibodies last 2-3 months..will mean booster vaccine every month? almost sounds like onion article...

After five hours shoveling rocks family’s backyard, Jimmy Flores, 30, met close friends bars Scottsdale Saturday night June.

""This bar super packed. **I kind concerned** like, man, everyone's tight, limited cups. people sharing drinks, weird,"" said Flores, also shared drinks his friends bar north Scottsdale that night.   Rubio saying something total BS?

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Less overall strain healthcare. everything still popping, hospitals backed least ""slowed"", strain bad resulting less deaths. experience treating too, others said. 

But whole flattening curve thing express purpose reduce strain once, much completely eliminate many would believe  People gotten heads cause oxygen deprivation. saw one individual local facebook page say kids oxygen sat dipped 90 mask on—which generous interpretation means oxygen saturation meter broken likely made up. None people seem think doctors nurses wear masks many hours surgery adverse effects. fund conspiracy theory virus started. Prioritization. wonder Trump punish him? work traveling field support rep, pulled road late March, given enough work carry past months. got green light go back road last week. lot stores company starting crawl back, many make midst closing. 

The first stimulus check actually helped immensely. money I'd already saved up, paid last bit student loan, car loan. get pulled road again, worry I'd job late August... like cult South Korea 
was almost sole source outbreak there. tried evade testing quarantine refused wear  mean... look pic lol influenza hella fat corona looks skinny af that's spreads faster lmao true Well 180,000 less people voting Biden (what reps thinking) One exclude other. symbiotic. mmmmm think reading graph correctly. also vaccines developed University Witwatersrand Yea don’t think that’s good thing Ah thought clicking tallest bar small touched one nearby apparently Let article warning others...  
Everybody take hours least read first third it.    
Yes. I'm mocking it.   
It reads like Readers Digest de-condenced book. Everyone get virus eventually, it’s stay. masks lockdowns delay inevitable. quicker achieve herd immunity better. Luckily virus 99.9% survival rate. usually conspiracy theorist pretty much convinced he's getting plasma recovered patients prophylactic. many people around tested positive seem taking precautions. Fuck economy entirely accurate though. live VA also. Unemployment ""suuuper"" easy automated. 

Just issues VEC disregard millions unemployed families struggling resolutions statewide. Hell check r/unemployment. 

This ""not states suck"" situation either, national emergency. emergency leadership incompetent, divided, simply flat give fuck people. 

Red blue care you.  1% power flinch strains average citizen continue inevitable. China Russia right now? actually thought joke... cut federal funding today. there's thing swing voter, Trump going lose?

Dems gonna show uninspiring old ass white man thry show uninspiring old ass white woman? C’mon Wisconsin let’s next! say GOV EVERS? Calling out. So... 283,000? person needs understand dumb ass person understand dumb ass. Motherfucker responsible lot unnecessary deaths. sending covid patients nursing homes recover... Sure daily death rates dropping ,sense April . month past many states begun open up. Yet still spike deaths . Maybe corona virus behaves like every corona virus dies heat . one tell joking not, probably stop telling ""jokes"". see lot “I disagree it’s bunk” comments without backing statement. well MTA, don’t states close NYC terms MTA Dallas county mandatory mask policy. guess trying take control. jumbled sentence thread without terrible reddit joke Looks like meat's back menu, boys! little late asshole. said beginning wouldn’t constituents literally spouting bullshit. I.e Palm Beach. Very, don’t think that’s true all, according John Hopkins counts. Monday typically very, low. Tuesday typically highest, Wednesdays also compare. Economy struggling. Well, government response decent (they pulled restrictions early health minister god's work), president pushing places open up, health minister disagrees regards. Anyways, ministry health driving pandemic response mainly.


On hand, many citizens taking seriously. lot new clusters morons mass gatherings put blame Nicaraguan poblation.


I predict go worse, (on observations going lately) airport reopening may go halt. MILLIONS people tested covid it. often 10% tests positive. different flu testing. know anyone tested flu? push agenda


Ah please tell us conspiracy theory There’s way it’s gonna take till Oct.1st reach 180k. Oh, okay, that's interesting. Fed get money then? 35 still self-quarantining? Trump isn’t businessman. ‘businesses’ fail again. idea run successful business run economy. knows inherit money. whole platform fraud shows. AZ highest deaths today 79, adult ICU bed capacity [reached 88% We've [now tied #3 new per day behind NY NJ, quickly rising surpass NJ. 

Oh Trump held rally Phoenix yesterday crowd 3k+.

Nah man, things still busy fuck. I’m worried small businesses, even lot fail, new ones take place eventually. Big events might smaller awhile, can’t imagine returning.

Haha joking trump would never ever listen expert. Yeah, saddens me. mother’s side family. brother give away since parents/grandparents gone. lose wedding family too. Irony become life now. deaths surge facilities get overwhelmed. Like said hope right. Would bet one cent hope, though. disparity seems amplified global stage seems point toward difference access health care, frankly. Fuck elon musk, greedy cunt going sacrifice human beings non essential brand Without leadership Washington, best we’re going able do. State local budgets decimated, without federal aid state local governments, it’s highly unlikely we’ll see another lockdown even tightening restrictions.

i millions would clue media reporting story. NO, made everyone wear mask EXCEPT people color. Ah, think lose one pulls ""no checks = infected"", :D Police unions exact reason aren’t closely supervised don’t accountability now. Stable genius move right there. Don’t get I’m saying? Anyone get severely sick this. I’m saying need go full-blown lockdown, shit like bars clubs dine restaurants guaranteed spread it, people work often choice expose risks, regardless potential health issues. I’d lot ok necessary precautions taken, state eased restrictions even case numbers hospitalizations rising. Masks politicized point wearing one statement, state government completely unwilling impose actual restrictions keep general population safe. 

Plus people get locations risk spreading others responsible can’t totally isolate various reasons. Look Florida recently, Louisiana Mardi Gras. plenty people partaking risky behavior got others taking unnecessary risks. 

And people back office completely unnecessary risk. It’s wildly irresponsible many people forced situation economics don’t even come play.

A health system collapse cause far problems economic collapse. Including potential economic issues people shoulder healthcare costs (can’t spend money money going towards medical debt), people aren’t willing risk health things don’t need. representing portion interests, union creating incentives parties pro-union may otherwise. allows express interests without putting vote parts candidate's platform. benefit indirectly long haul. understand (though agree it).

This. keep hearing whole ""situation"" caused people struggle financially, people need go work virus stop them. issues arn't problem though, virus simply showed us problem existed along US, social safety net help shit hits fan. People choose exposing dangerous virus pay mortgage going homeless, yet are, continuing vote policies would increase taxes (mostly among wealthy) social programs might also rich someday. We’re world leaders twisting peoples minds onto profits coming I'm Vancouverite lives NYC. Like say, morbidly fascinating watch differences people government responded.

Canadian government (especially provincial government within home province BC) gave prudent transparent public health guidance, also essentially bankrolling shutdown specifically directing money towards people lost jobs businesses shutdown. communicated need stay home also providing financial means. people listened, largely followed instructions basis would help neighbors get relatively unscathed.

The US government weird hodge-podge things, including: $1200 sent nearly everyone (regardless job status), forgivable business loans demand far outstripped supply, leaving many businesses effectively screwed. Simultaneously, president continuously downplayed issue undermined need stay home (and later wear mask), federal government abdicated responsibility many things (testing coordination financial support, strict lockdown guidelines, stockpiles supply chain critical supplies, financial support states), leaving state local governments fend largely come separate 50 responses. limited financial support, businesses need open order avoid going bankrupt. Simultaneously, half people country decided virus exist, happy frequent businesses. Within half, mixed bag fear/uncertainty, boredom/impatience, (in opinion) lack understanding even parts country handled comparatively well... US never shut-down degree countries got number cases-per-capita levels countries. Even ""better-off"" parts country, people ""done"" virus. Yes! think there’s general lack regulation? Yeah know; infuriating, especially someone know like person they're exhibiting dumb behavior. 

We went lockdown people complained overreacting. eased lockdowns say we're ending fast enough. say 'ok, lockdown please social distance wear mask', say fuck that, lockdown virus over. symptom way country going divided years IMO. Right, that's meant - stupid top party pandemic suspect maybe could outbreak feel 'urging' residents enough contain spread virus ease pressure hospitals. people care... think amplifies rays OMG named project ""Project McAfee"" anti virus software. god hope backs DNA goes further...McAfee wOrSe many viruses...

At least read comments Americans like Michigan, Canadians. wording kind confusing think “aunt” infected hosts mother. guy article said sister sick nephew hosted party. kid’s going kill grandparents mother hosted party cough pandemic. Selfish idiot. Yes!

I absolutely hate online classes. Especially stay home much possible this.

All lists, alarms, reminders work starts feel like one long week sure day lose track time easily. Studies contradictory that. They're definitely *less* infectious much question. Cringe That's never going happen good really hard time believing surgeon would say masks good. reason 0% chance infected without mask case distance relevant factor. leave house (social/physical distancing) presence mask irrelevant. right next you, distance, mask becomes relevant perfect. Sufficient distance 100% effective. Even N95 mask less 100% effective. 

Distance Mask Ugh, I’m sorry you’re dealing too! I’ve made mistake dialogues people refuse wear mask. somehow think wanting baby live really less important feeling “The government trying take rights away.” won’t listen reason: hurt government don’t wear mask? could kill innocent person...YES Adult conversations happening comment suggested media reliable. live would call get reliable daily data HC community?

most people know, time. public health authorities PR folks, get important info public. public get info, newspaper, radio, local TV news. FL (Tampa Bay, specifically). feel like we’re serving example rest country? Like.. happens “open up, go back normal!”

I hate playing role rest country. hope good comes it, though. 

Would really like leave team Florida, I’m convinced states listen.

Link source please. WWE star(she’s interviewer) Kayla Braxton posted Twitter March apparently again. terrifying thing that’s case. Death rates remained steady declining, regions increased hospitalizations last weeks. 

Some places also seeing jumps % tests coming back positive can’t attributed increased testing. point tRump tried war criminal he’s done here? I’m serious. many tens thousands deaths hands now? agree you, sincerely hope I’ve witnessed merely loud vocal minority rather serious concern. Cuz don’t want live state more.

Shit man, I'm brewer US sales far we're literally working overtime like crazy, working 60+ hours week. thing really changed shifts staggered prevent overlap sanitize shit wear mask. Incredibly noone gotten sick yet. Hopefully stays way. What's funny people dutifully believe vaccine comes ""safe effective,"" ...and also zero scientific backup.  Yet believe it. part 80% population who've completely sheepified dumbed mainstream, taught think, think...they've taught ""science"" want believe without presenting peer reviewed studies demonstrates reason believe.  called suckered bunch charlatans.

Quite opposite way interpreted it. guess should’ve clearer apparently ""tomorrow"" would sufficient. May last month Pew pretty well known non-partisan data focused. That’s always going argument; you’ve still offered competing data even substantive argument beyond “wahh you’re wrong I’m allergic information it’s liberal 5 weeks ago.” 

It’s easy jump conclusions, eh? Defend beliefs otherwise you’re going get called out. Private prisons = modern slavery posted another subreddit seems like incorrect.

Thank you! far able to. felt sick fiends child who’s chemo canceled. good news kids getting active treatment well! that’s relief!  several viruses cause influenza Give us masks WELL, certainly headed direction. “But I’m greatest country world. it’s God given right big dipshit want be. can’t stop me! don’t like it, go back came from.” Seriously man, don’t know. lot us ashamed ourselves. thanks. don’t want fucking homeless. fuck Spy puts say?

Polio, yellow fever, etc. brutal then. Public health improvements (like masks clean water, hygiene) hence huge rise average life expectancy.

Point being, theres lots experience prior planning recent past. Govt focus getting shit done budgets hugely cut since 80s. People going Universal Orlando already /sigh Around 6 months depending type vaccine. use different technologies, e.g. Imperial’s self-replicating RNA vaccine completely new technology. issue certify won’t long term effects say 6 months Yeah that's San Marcos.

Most places central Texas driven past 50 something weight middle class people mask, attitude face going.

Why people quickest thump US Constitution always ones can't bothered read understand it? wow... March 16th feels long ago...  
i still feel like Easter around corner... can't believe already almost July... interfere God's wonderful breathing system! article linked said it’s determining whether false positive confirmed yet, we’re talking one test far. besides wild speculation, completely different country less, Vietnam’s claim debunked? It’s simple question. It’s funny it’s true agree 100%. terrible person minimum, going crowded bar, avoid contracting spreading virus. Despite seeing dangers TV, internet, radio, flyers, posters, doctors, nurses, politicians, scientists warn over, over, again.

The idea wants people pay hospital bills? Selfish. others infected bar?

Unbelievable idiocy selfishness. ask proof claims run good, since government making many regulations can't even afford open up. I'm pretty proud pa despite lot friends bitching it. almost green means we'll shut back month cause people morons. Yea I’ll get right back that, busy right Depends. quit work safety standards covid, still get think? 

So imagine people quit get unemployment seen single business employers following even simple safety precaution (wearing masks) correctly.  refuse believe real life. America alien civilization rest world Florida know.... always hero ♥️ Don’t let fool you. return vengeance hopefully local/state governments act accordingly again. stalled stimulus money, 1,200.00$ going much deposited monthly. people work since mid February still received unemployment checks. Millions evictions help sight. Scary times many.. Oxford vaccine manufactured give temporary immunity though “The study, yet peer-reviewed...” media need stop making click-baity titles based studies haven’t even published yet.  Aw. means lot me.

Like getting haircut sucks people seem forget bad actually economic depression is. misplaced pride end hurting wallets long term inevitably lead unnecessary deaths. Smfh. worst part that’s we’ve seen preventative measures work countries still incapable agreeing basic fact masks help. There’s still people haven’t gotten unemployment back pay stimulus checks. still called discrimination Aaaand William Henry Harrison left chat Disney amusement parks literally last things need open right now.

They’re asking folks conglomerate lines spread COVID. problem they'll spread countless others. possible love Trump, empathy fellow humans. live KY town minor league soccer game (outdoor stadium) 50% capacity (7500 fans). little surprising. Singapore one countries managed every country says it’s going do: protect elderly otherwise vulnerable populations. shows wonderfully low death rate.

However, Singapore also got quite lucky that, according article, 90% infected foreign workers living dorms. people don’t live older relatives, likely relatives visit Singapore, infections broke could easily isolated rest city’s population. foreign workers would also likely young, especially healthy able get job.

Still Singapore great success story. addition low death rate, number new infections found country coming down. hope historians remember success stories pandemic failures. Thank you. stupidest part it’s like bunch people color demanding exemption. 


It’s like saying “The new speed limit 65, Asians drive 75.”


“Actually, we’re cool driving speed every-“

“STOP RACIST TOWARDS YOURSELF.” start door door testing targeted neighbourhoods. favorite infected bacteria breathe out. Good.

Reopening canceled. Depends extra money (assuming any). I'm prepared dollar collapse, although think going Weimar style hyperinflation. wonder going past couple weeks could possibly creating issues nothing businesses opening up..... Apparently Arizona consulted survey Well either way don’t think reality matter idiots buckle deflection. dont understand models bad. Clearly cases spiking like crazy, would assume death rate going go way down. feel like lulls everyone false sense security. already cancelled activities next summer.

Me too, except Christmas, family planning us (half-dozen) hard-core quarantine 2 weeks before. Getting groceries beforehand last long, etc. way spend days together one place. Reopening already early. top it, none measured. Hoards people, little mask usage. Ridiculous. might noticing physical consistency public drawing wrong conclusions. Fat doesn’t equal stupid.

Everywhere else? masks, maybe 1 10 wearing them. Bars restaurants attempting social distance, seemed gave people started coming in. 

The funny things noticed, jackpots machines really low, since one playing them. Like low hundreds things would thousands usually. couple also go upgraded multiple room suite price original room, like $50. think Cosmopolitan, exactly sure. looking fountain Belagio though. showed empty desperate hotels seemed be.

I've also watching people go various Orlando parks, though seems least workers adamant getting people wear masks, keeping rides half empty. still think open couple months least. infectious still. lol Guess what, Elon might like cool sci fi stuff hope projects suceed they'll good humanity always remember he's still another ultrarich jerk care you.

Lol first time seeing people hate Elon. Wow. Almost 99% internet loves him. one post criticizes actions whole thread starts going wild him. Read article. Gives info keep safe know, reading :( immune system antibodies. actually don’t want ton antibodies floating around body every infection you’ve fought long term.

This isn’t something shuts idea immunity all.

If relied antibodies, vaccine would ever work. Less deaths *so far.....* yet buttercup.  ELON BAD! TESLA BAD! much incorrect info post bait Good point. That's seems trend Musk products. Sell profitability rather profits. really amaze huge companies without generating profit. think Netflix similar long time. stop know talking about.  Commercial applications already scheduled market US later Yes, country Denmark getting many tourists from. point. LOL Like major cities Midwest, NE, etc, PROTESTS without rise cases? Terrible analogy, babysitter parents know serious pandemic going best spread amongst eachother time literally obvious start understanding expectation economies currently low coronavirus case counts, i.e. Sweden, recover quickly. There's done stuff going on, e.g. Sweden's neighbors opening borders.

The advocates Sweden either stay quiet come new reasons Sweden's approach better, e.g.:
- Sweden's kids smarter school
- risk second wave smaller lol American Don’t much ambient temperature, rather fact it’s hot cold, people seek indoor conditioned air, easily spreads respiratory droplets. RNA Polymerase go GRAAATTATTTAAA Uh actually it’s gotten cult status “followers”. NC enforce law. It’s felony, want roll dice police? You’ve following news all? Right!? haven’t left gated community since March...2007. China tried hide data within first month so, USA trying hide data six months in. Hard say worse Elon seems fine both. lol, tesla actually detailed plan handling this, walmart none. taco bell none. home depot none.

US country like country constitution like other. stop countries acting responsible times? consistency constitution really important saving American lives? American constitution rule constitution apply cases like whoever wrote constitution made mistake. Interesting, even cases seem skyrocket, hospital patients numbers dropping hospital.

Great supplied proof all. Politician's denials facts change facts. Idc come across cold saying this, good. hope survive hope go hell realise shitty people are. CVS near you? indicate symptoms pre-screen able get one there. name dozen companies fire uttering word union mean target you, sorry unclear! I'd also something stay close bring change involve systematic messup. kind getting old stuck here, otherwise fine. think way, people taking serious here, war something see. physical invasion thing like that. people willfully ignorant. remember, ignorance bliss SE Asia different concept privacy compared US, too. went pre-school Taiwan middle school play yard bathroom squat toilets middle doors sides building right open two urinals. privacy take piss. things Americans consider invasion privacy cultures scratch heads over. I'd argue Americans take concept privacy dangerous extreme we're worried ""slippery slopes"" logical fallacies really comes different cultural hangups. Im saying possibility.
Just many people buy cars systemic problem. Seems either would fixed wouldn’t exist.
Definitely problem batteries though Yeah? said “please feel obligated so”. left part they’d get fired. Trump asked quarantine boss everything would worry seeing there's tourists middle May.

Also, I'm sorry, thought Denmark thread. Denmark exist relation Sweden something? person i've seen say true woman twitter everything right, self isolated, masks, washing, that, still caught it. compromised, knew risks, shit like still caught it. true. work somewhat true depends state. 

For example, Massachusetts law require employers pay employee on-call time employee required employer's premises employee able effectively use time personal purposes.

It's exceptionally shitty, that's works states. unemployment expansion actually could worked pretty well theory. extra $600 week, top average UI payment $385, ~$4200 month average.

Unfortunately unemployment handled state state basis, many states long backlogs, 2 months+. difficulties unemployment - everyone qualifies, number people get false denial appeal, works employed people, etc. would skipped means testing given everyone $600 direct deposit every week imagine would cut cases pretty drastically. correct. Many places can't even test vaccine actually control virus. It’s impossible. we’re talking absolute survival strategy, far strict quarantine measures keeping people 20 feet apart.  believe Wernher von Braun's Saturn V rocket developed NASA.

For years people saying China going surpass US AI, yet never comes fruition. Silicon Valley remains vanguard. think hearing less symptoms could negatively impact careers. Long term damage still big question mark company’s supposed announcing office reopening plans next week so.

Anything “wait proven, permanent slowing virus spread vaccine” totally reckless irresponsible considering work home.

Insane looks like we’ll probably vaccine December January people still want rush things back normal cause unnecessary deaths infections. family, think long don’t hug, everything else fine. Me: 2 minute half life summer sunlight

Would staying house didn’t mean exclusion mentioning police unions mentioned specifically due that’s going right main factor can’t fire bad cops (or keep hired next town 😠). Also Washington Post article omits important two people fired responded email planned returning since May. basically ghosted company got fired it, totally reasonable.

But hey, Jeff Bezos's newspaper hit piece labor dispute one competitors...must true. nothing Rivian. Nice piece shit move. mean tough choice would like purchase EV end day, Tesla bad reputation petro based auto company know bad reputation (doesn't mean one, highly doubt auto factories maker great qualities life) would lean towards petro would cheaper, less inconvenient refuel negative impressions brand.  


But let's real would get like chevy volt heard name think probably EV. tell I'm market currently. tell many people Nobody owes anyone fuck wild west dystopian capitalistic United States. Every dumb fuck own. country completely incapable protecting citizens global pandemic. agree more. countries same. 2nd infections would rare. Hell, can't even test vaccine places. basically know. People reddit don’t care inconveniences reality. ""Younger people soon spreading virus people requiring hospital beds, ICU beds ventilators""

The could also headline article. spin truth fit whatever narrative like I'd prefer reality instead wishful thinking. careful data available. work ""common cold"" rhinovirus attaches nasal cavity. novel coronavirus thought maybe enter nose/eyes etc attaches throat. Nasal irrigation may wash virus throat. Gargle, yes, warm salt water mouthwash, may helpful sure nasal irrigation.  Love username way! yeah, type attitude way common. many people ""well fuck you, can't tell do"" type attitude, even literally help stop people dying. Nope, always pocket people alive New Zealand, Iceland, Greenland Madagascar... I’d say game getting part right. 

What didn’t understand kill everyone win, feel like 99.9% population still means virus according nDemic... Natural Selection Totally unavoidable. Shame. coop chickens.

Sorry kink leave comments barring previous conversation. speak English English sub? Odd. 

Anyway, I'm talking [the rolling 7 day average Sweden cycling 1st, 2nd, 3rd places weeks now. 

Overall, sure, worst hit countries world still ahead Sweden deaths per capitay, hardly rining endorsement. Sweden #7 overall #5 micronations excluded: Exactly! point DeSantis even State’s hospitals stop saying “symptoms acute April good baby! Check WWE, GREAT here.....I mean NBA.....I mean Disney....I mean....uhhhh.....” It’s fucking criminal. Here's hoping. early tell 24h trend. ""Well manbearpig real. supposed it?"" something something virus something 120,000 something Testing limited back then. searched data bit find it, I'd interested seeing per capita daily hospitalizations locked compares right Texas specifically Houston. I'm sure Muskateers excuse reason too. designed say ""I'm fucking idiot give shit others"" Well tears it, never buy Tesla. point on, vow never buy Tesla product. 
Yes siry, they’ve certainly lost potential client right here.

Okay confess, never going buy anything Tesla anyway I’d never able afford it, 2 reasons. Well-behaved men rarely make history. admit, dismissal phrase much better mine. get people arsey wearing them. very, likely considerable utility wearing facemasks.

I say wasn't. yes, stay home can. can't insane wear mask.

Yes, wrote exactly already. reason stupid argument happening someone wrote unclear what's better, distance masks. said evidence clear distance superior, stay away others can't wear mask. Antibodies last forever (any?) diseases. body stops making antibodies produces t-cells memory produce encounter virus again. That's gives long term immunity union help here? think Tesla honest policy, fucking employees, fucking themselves. product become worse reap sow. Competitors easily scoop talent make Tesla pay shortcomings.  We’re getting much better data now, largest problem random sampling determine prevalence. can’t even estimate it. region right getting 30% positive results testing blood cells self selected, don’t know there’s large bike coming test hospital present system, it’s complete chaos.

Best available information right pointing something lot higher thought before, maybe 1%. don’t know purposely lining ourselves, Arizona governor pulled plug epidemiological study modeling. USA country world even debating mask use extent. Thanks Koch bros Hell think get trouble lying fucking report like rest us. Brianna Taylor injuries? don’t need Maury tell that’s lie. crime file false police report police it? bet party injecting those, realize hard manufacture those? Wake fuck up. Yep, think reason. People throw around ""it's free country!""... Great, mean literally freedom whatever hell want. Also add fact people general quite selfish, like said. give two shits actions affect others, affects them. They're spewing public service announcement, expect sympathy help, that's gets me. yes, I'm heartless, antibodies I'd still donate seriously, fuck people.  100% confirm. Life normal there. Grew there, shit post ridiculous. They're concerned ""violating rights"" comes masks social distancing. still think hoax. Multi billion dollar companies treating workers like replaceable livestock shocker correct - see influence skewed misplaced - unlike facts science (no sarcasm although assume could lol) Looks like they're getting Beijing control. Definitely good news. shows whether Asian European strain, still defeat way. leaving lot details make seem like Musk got rich nothing.

Payapl result MERGER Confinity X.com. Musk founded created X.com. one first online banks insured FDIC. big CEO PayPal 6 months fired.

This straight lie. fired. replaced CEO still board directors. 

I think Musk huge asshole. time need lie history. asshole-ish acts well known speak themselves.  SAID TOODLES! Yes. Non-Corp ones. employer understanding compassionate whole pandemic thing. Probably answer anybody. I'm lucky never work large corporation again. guess dwindling around thump three whole months instead reinforcing health system Bruh. Yes mean nothing. fuck government actually accomplished 6 months? That’s right, nothing.

We testing. Yayyyyyy! Back full blown opening time!

That’s it. Assuming seen video bat shit crazy people arguing masks devil wants 5G, Hilary Clinton, Bill gates deep state responsible.  SoCal here.work mall also confirm. neighboring store work 12-15 cases... (f21 ontario mills)their workforce 35 people. another store neighboring two people catch lady works kiosk caught well. yet cleaning crews mall, even store doesn’t clean like should. it’s also crazy HR department nothing. 20 person limit store managers constantly try push order profit. don’t count “employees” head count even though ten us. mandatory mask rule (the recent one lmao) would say like 60/70% customers wearing masks support Sweden's model, really know approach good, bad, horrific winter. impossible Sweden much less severe wave 2, hospitals neighbors become over-run. economy also look much better neighbors then, since open neighbors not. also possible vaccine comes early people Sweden died nothing. regardless, drawing conclusion silly.

Thankfully death rate Texas (7 day average) actually LOWER month ago.

Also number patients positive tests hospitalized LOWER weeks percentage positive cases (number cases corrected change tests performed) increased hope people practice social distancing. Uh, increase cases, assume newly infected part deaths soon. Given Texas seeing record new cases every day now, seriously ill, takes time serious illness become death. increase cases, increase deaths eventually follows.

This even something really provide lot supporting evidence for. common sense, it? also already seen story places like New York. sure incredulous it. THING HAPPENED NEW JERSEY KILLED 4 PEOPLE!!!! least NJ happened early stateside covid cases. family TX excuse awful. numbers scary. People need realize weeks hospitals see big surge admissions. Governors need part mandate stricter measures, otherwise hospitals able handle it.   Lumpectomies considered elective, think mastectomies go either way depending severity. wife oncology nurse austin, may areas policy. consumer spending that's tanked, someone company automotive supply chain we're around 80% pre covid volumes.

Per CDC. typically stay away types discussion. here, I’ve read responses COVID. measure done isolation, needs done measures actually slow spread.

Otherwise Friday would massive economy destruction day. vacations season. took streets Saturday, June 6, marching protests Cincinnati.  really important part history right now,” said. “I think it’s important everyone gets makes heard.”  next day, woke feeling bad.

So yeah, catch COVID protest. Incubation time longer 1 day. Farts airborne, corona aerosols much heavier.

Meaning hypothesis-generating findings study suggest role colchicine treatment patients coronavirus disease 2019.

- **Hospital Utilization:** COVID Hospitalizations skyrocketed 8% (another time high). ICU beds COVID patients 5%, (Overall ICU bed usage stayed 88%). Ventilators use COVID 2% (all time high).

Lol, graduated State I've done many times. terrible, need make sure hit DC Baltimore right times Oh I’m totally wrong. You’re absolutely right. It’s 10,000 total. 80,000 comes total infected. Minnesota epicenter protests even experiencing week week declines. photos protests show everyone wear masks. Stonks go up. Even Elon knows that. August lot states. Way ahead you. I’ve already nailed 7 strikes row. Waiting go. Except see next weeks entire country goes back lock not.

120,000 dead people. 2 people? That's all? Jesus christ, maybe ment fired? people fucking insane. I'd honestly consider moving another state actually enforced public. However masks mandatory PA sorta kinda really. mere suggestion everyone nothing more. family mocks wearing one, shop stores require mask can’t comprehend thinks things magically become catastrophic without closing implementing mask mandate. Literally avoiding bare minimum appease dear leader **Denholm:** *[answers phone]* Hello? What? Well can't work team fired. That's it, heard me, fired! Get things go.

**Denholm:** Dom, get recruitment. Get look security team work team. may escort current security team building acting like team. believe least one company said go healthcare workers first, makes sense need workforce administrating vaccine vaccinated themselves. vaccine works well elderly (some vaccines don't, phase 3 results tell us that) go next. Also expect Oxford vaccine go UK citizens first, perhaps Fauci means US release. get bullied name rhymes (or turned something rhymes with) numerous parts human anatomy.

You get bullied wearing cool clothes.

But yeah, I'm sure kid named ""(unintelligible gibberish) (type airplane)"" going coast unscathed....

... he's exclusively homeschooled. almost got hired Tesla one Service Centers. 9 interviews, plenty qualified job, maybe qualified, learned stress employees go meet quarterly targets, plus always opening posted area positions Service. finally got job offer another manufacturer took it. 9 phone 1 person interview absurd. 4 years ago. spent year ideal position working home another automotive position take medical leave health issue pandemic. essential worker. Next thing know get separation email stating due virus, services needed needed downsize. Still unemployed.  views **one specific instance 55 year old woman inappropriately denied care, dying horrible, tortuous manner**.

Again, 99.999999999% submissions msm anyone see submissions. truth can't win virus Sweden well countries probably hit much earlier first anticipated (reports today cases early January outside large metropolitan areas) thus making efforts contain trace virus naive best.

Totally false defeatist. Taiwan new local cases 70+ days one instnace. big companies like this, it’s unlikely HR leg work getting employees back work. it’s possible communicating managers HR also able reach them.

This happens lot employees get new phone number give managers directly fail update HR system. like cuban donates ton charity still lot questionable opinions. 

Oh no! *questionable opinions*!!!

What tyrant! Let's eat him! I’m seeing lot redditors acting like know multi-million dollar companies devote thousands man hours deciding investing Tesla/Spacex. Bad investments happen, sure, armchair investors call PR sham laughable. symptoms started appear day after. Symptoms take very, least 2 days appear. nothing happend protests. need opinions/guidance issue....

Should cancel? 3 us healthy like thought 3 yr old getting infected. masks wear knows everyone else flight too. son also hates things face period time (like 7 minutes lol) know keeping impossible.

Any opinions? way frame questions answers. people send questionnaires to. Like maybe send people owned dodge, swapped tesla, swapped back dodge. Making nefarious survey easy funny. especially becomes problem humans let worldview defined psychopathic morons. believe whatever want to.

When confronted believing person internet believing data available, choose data. Thanks.

Obviously cases going nationwide, data protests shows blip radar. probably....  That's right, patriot. Please make sure barhop 75% full establishments show beautiful new 'do too. economy ain't gonna stimulate itsself! couple counties mask requirements go business. Houston many counties spread out. It’s beyond mess. 75% capacity bars, restaurants. Restaurants busy. 

Baseball, softball, etc. games happening. Large family gatherings happening. People going vacations time. social distancing enforcement.

Okay I'm going hang now, thanks call.

Not sure call went like that, maybe stress? huge red flag. still got calls Tesla recruiters, even hear them.

People die far quicker federal government find it. you’re saying BAR classy? whole state nonessential LA seeing steady increase since started. Early intervention lockdown prevented New York levels, lockdown over, we're seeing would been. due protests, due Karens. That's crazy thing. Hospitalizations trailing stat. Wanna bet see hospitalization spike couple weeks? can't tell norm fans. seem think absolutely wrong world anti Elon agenda, every bizarre act making like USA nearly doubled flu deaths 2017-2018 3 months. fear that's making cautious. want people around fellow citizens getting sick. never 100% lock down, know need squash this. wife love care dreamed planned tesla one day, guess looking better company support. taken seriously now, see virus avoidance behaviors start improve. masks, less congregation crowded bars beaches.

Can't go hospital unless life death. crazy thing intelligent person heard argument, day 1, way save lives economy shutdown, test, contact trace, isolate. roadmap save lives jobs minimize suffering. 

If think governors aren’t stupid (debatable), explanation embracing roadmap politics. People dying politics.

This unforgivable. Good luck run imof shit tickets then.  businessinsider chart Feb-Mar causes death disease. Covid-19 third place \~100k heart disease cancer \~200k time period.

[Sierra locked hard, including banning non-essential movement districts. 

Masks contribute prevention, practically countries tried policy masks normal life, idea know policy feasible ludicrous. No, ones. There's difference common sense (you need hindsight figure spread would happen) saying ""it'll bad regardless, let's stay quarantine next decade"". Evolution still ongoing, apparently going backwards us. dust cloud happens every single year. God hate propaganda channels Report That's citation says.  Please quote correctly. Eh, said would gone August. best, plateauing. cases ever day yesterday. really really hope right end would less deaths, sustainable. happily ignore know since several decades: humans planet faster we'll destroy it. rate, (still accelerating btw) poor kids born nowadays actually live ""end world"", making unhinhabitable earth. seas warming thought dying eyes, might live too, next decade. Yes, dust major factor comes dampening storm severity.  Fair enough. get people though. butt thank you. lack critical thinking skills I’m sorry it. What? We’ll August rate we’re going.

   skirting responsibility pushing action states two things: 1) gives president plausible deniability; 2) speaks base's notion state's rights.  However demanding state's play game PPE respirators unconscionable. showing empathy tens thousands dead well. Buying bulk PPE reselling highest bidder criminal. Purposely misleading public treatment, vaccines, testing, etc. criminal. loses, thrown jail. There's one tri state area.

If so, well done.

If so, please take friendly “The Know,” douchey comment. shit gets wild, happy TP! Cooper getting power Coronavirus law. cannot unilaterally order laws made (or ignored) otherwise, come AUG 1 masks go back felony unless something changes. live Pittsburgh. crushed curve. better shit. US economy ruins

Compared where? whole planet going fucked raw virus years. US advanced manufacturing, tech, finance par superior Europe. Plane orders worth 100's billions flowing back US end year -- takes years fulfill orders. properly locking insuring infected quarantined..

The US opened way early want bunch lunatics. disturbed headlining? Nope still wrong...again. study killing virus airborne. ""He"" saying would one caught it... Funny, mention BLM/AntiFa riots protests. I've read studies say take 5 years lungs heal smoking. Australia feds refusing fully lock down, states forced it. Lol sub probably worst I've ever come across. almost exclusively filled radical liberals Chinese communist shills. added exception expires August 1st pertain Cooper's EO yesterday? Better eat cakes family beat people, burn city loot innocent people's stores. mean ever country needed purge stupidity US. let wear masks die off? love god more, sincerely New York Thanks. I’m worried myself, others community. house equipped electric shutters, backup generator, plenty low wetlands take excess storm water. won’t evacuate animals. survived direct hit Irma. 1,000x worse 9/11. Short vaccine widely deployed today NY deep deep shit. Yet ! plan IPO Q3-Q4 2020. entering pre-ipo funding round.

You follow us social medias updates :) Yes, matter time they'd become useful.

Exhibit A: &lt;Picture whole fucking world right People really good wearing masks MA. People bitching moaning it, they're it. result, numbers way re-openings still going planned . . . actually ahead schedule numbers low. people walking streets, almost always masks. Every business, masks required. Everyone it.

I understand residents, leaders, look states like MA, others well, see numbers going down, letting us slowly get economy going again, people see thing ""no screw we'll ignore virus instead"". get it. 

I'm cyclist wear mask bike. Instead bike alone. cross paths someone woods, pull get way, me. amount responsibility see really encouraging. know that's going jive months now, states get point practically eliminated, states pandemic full-on raging. national leadership. watched carefully thru mid-April, flip-flopping masks made give source wisdom guidance (also there's weird corruption heavyhandedness China erodes confidence statements). trust federal government consistent helpful, either. I'm pretty much looking governor state (Newsom) county health official (Dr. Sara Cody) guidance. 

Since mid-April, i've mainly skimmed headlines respect WHO. actually looked hood ""asymptomatic transmission rare"" comment, get briefing details less misleading headline, *it unacceptably misleading headline likely create false confidence significant number people would hear headline look details briefing itself* irresponsible, turned off.

Honestly, fuck guys. articulate thing done significantly helped crisis? Honest question i'm saying there's nothing, i'm saying heard it? interactive article: 22,000 deaths** New York City area could avoided country started social distancing one week earlier, Columbia University researchers estimate.  36,000 deaths** nationwide could avoided early May social distancing begun earlier, estimates say. 

And this: now, America remains dark.  infected people never tested. little capacity trace isolate contacts test positive. lockdowns expired, new cases spiked again.

The US bad time coming month(s)... ""bounce back"" ongoing pandemic though? worry New York given tightly packed together is. planning moving city literally March year now, can't see even traveling near future fact even existed racist fuck. Mask wearing minor inconveniences worst saves lives... black white thing.. believe scientists saying somewhere middle. BWAHAHAHAHA Can’t lie, pretty awesome live time people’s privilege backfiring. Play stupid games, win stupid prizes. sympathy dumb bitches. athletic least shape sit home day play video games kind guy? Definitely agree disagree. 

If antibodies provide certain level immunity virus mutates fast everyone could get reinfected, would render possible vaccine obsolete everyone could get vaccinated? Mostly asking vaccine always portrayed ""one great hope"" defeat virus short term immunity would mean continuous booster shots throughout entire year rapid mutations could also mean never get effective vaccine. food thought. goal? eradicate Covid? never got this. long remember never urge resist new facts, even views. Sometimes, took bit time adjust views new information, never came mind dismiss favor living Lala-land.

I mean people good lying constantly? can't dissonance would drag instead contributing positively kind piece mind. work manufacturing Honestly thought same, didn’t think five year old autistic son would ever keep mask day, third mask type wearing day daycare. 3 year old always liked mask made ninja. number deaths dosent get updated CDC automatically. info trickles slowly states, counties around country.

In weeks whining numbers high before.


No one ignoring rest world except you.


Deaths spike 20-40% ok that.

People worried causes death eternity.

But ignore that.

It's easier whine like child people think wear mask infect others. sounds like american thing.  Didnt explain denounce it? XD  doesnt alter DNA. puts mRNA cells, degrades goes away days afterwards. permanent genome alteration, improves theoretical safety profile. makes cells make viral proteins while.. like virus does! Mississippi here...

To hell handcart... thats best way describe here... one political party blame mess fucking know it. profitable arent reinvesting money grow company. Profits look bad startup, means cashing already done instead growth. Username checks out. get unemployment benefits friends Construction job social distance in. constantly someones business lifting something marking something whatever. people don’t like bossed around adult arbitrary rules change every day brother got 28.000$ Dad Zip2. That's TWENTY EIGHT THOUSAND MILLIONS.
Stop spreading fake news, Donald.

Edit: I'm interested sources 'millions emerald money'  mom watches drives nuts. tone sounds like he's trying incite fear paranoia.  Note anyone cares spin positive: don't. 

Possibly infectious less deadly changes little ground terms hospitalizations deaths, except *more people get roll dice.* Excuse me, call ""essential workers"" ""heroes"" applaud them. 

That's need, really. Applause, protections, PPE, hazard pay, better working conditions, better healthcare plans. They're heroes. What's company? mention it? Lol! going to? NO! told retarded sycophants fucking hoax told it'll go away.  Israel, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Kuwait, UAE Qatar examples well developed country's extremely hot seen significant outbreaks.

While numbers going higher actually testing far poorer neighbours.  also means (if true) average case far less severe initially assumed, exponential growth cases would smaller impact hospitalizations.

That said, I'd never base public policy assumption agree caution still best policy. learned nothing NYC. Literally one biggest causes death nyc encouraging people stay home lips turned blue making routine care impossible get. TINY bit forethought could prevented GDP Great Depression dropped 8%, covid dropped 20%. Try corona lets see run...try corona 3 times lets see even reach cliff regularly tried failed countless suicides..


Dont mind rockstar people..

He safe internet..

He say here..

Remember.. dont see ANYONE saying ANYWHERE normal world.. dont let get head..  Argentina lockdown crap economy, virus still control despite lockdown. Outside Japan country early hard response virus succeeded?  big issue UK recently, jobs required sleep workers basically told pay flat rate entire time there; want premises, pay hourly rate. Came someone home emergency basically told go fuck themselves, sleeping call call home, courts supported her.

I made argument everywhere worked nights; I'm allowed leave building minimum staffing requirements, pay entire period there, stopping lunch breaks.  India too. India top list, lack knowledge 2 words: Coordination competence. she.

Elon good reddit 100!!1! enough medical professionals staff? heard going allow 4 year med students work pandemic. quality care drop some, relatively.

I'm also curious high percentage Asian population Vancouver area helped contribute flattening curve. presume Asian-Canadians attuned what's happening Asia probably took seriously willingly wore masks. already see response. Stop testing. defended test sites. us first half gonna lie.  beneficial people color victimized centuries! deserve wear masks unless FEEL LIKE IT, that's equality works! Fucking /s, examples disgusting sad, I'd hope states mask ordinaces would obvious people masks. people wearing masks late March/early April events took place. believe Colorado also well led; we'll see get massive spike next week accounts reopening, I'm proud AF living Gulf Shores, AL small tourist town multiple cases infected restaurant employees. Tourism bread butter one gives 2 tugs masks social distancing. Tourists may brought may take back home cuz seafood beach Redneck Riviera. appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* feel biggest protests DC ever seen horizon? areas got torched initially population takes way seriously southern states are.

I wish true Michigan (Detroit Metro area hit hard March). Now, number people wearing masks grows daily, including patrons employees small stores, large retailers like wholesale clubs big grocery chains. perfect virus. time realize city trouble, fucked. Plan month flatten curve enjoy lock down. case many southern states, take bull horns, breath 'murica freedom ride hard. winning strategy. selfish necessarily bad long nobody getting seriously hurt affecting couple people. could potentially hurt everyone know want wear mask bit. Even kill, way health system set up, going left huge amount medical debt.

Just death comes everyone eventually mean run traffic ""we going die eventually"". Nope. I'm trying look beyond politics &amp; opinions improve understanding. Yang 2020.  Hey ""Remind me!"" guys, everything turn 2-3 weeks ago? 

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe call covid deniers 3 weeks ago. frustrates end people bring discussing US response virus. Yep, covered things up, know what, entire world knew still dropped ball, denied weren’t even part game. 

Here cases, deaths least coordinated response world. know matters here? US response. work construction tough guy mentality industry downplays sickness.

Really? I've found opposite. offices legitimately near dead called sick given shit weeks, construction called sickness injury pretty much always given benefit doubt. yesterday guy working notice sweating anymore threw bottle powerade told take 15 shade.

&amp;#x200B;

Meanwhile cough sadly quite common multiple different construction trades. Saw dust, concrete dust, dirt work, crawl spaces. lend coughs temporary chronic.

&amp;#x200B;

I believe work construction industry, have, havn't done long multiple crews. Nearly every crew i've puts safety first. one wants working scaffolding someone dizzy sick. one expects guy back spasm carry 100 lb concrete forms day long. Normalcy bias. Supposedly 70% global population might problem it. states within 25% exceeding hospital capacity already lockdown.

You feedback loops especially among poorly understood asymptomatic symptomatic cases continue seed new infections.

And positive cases lag behind hospital admissions around two weeks. Many positive cases see today may require hospitalization weeks.

The end result country decided kill people reason sub still enforcing rules political speech. impressive managed bring outbreak control, tbh. Considering virus spreading full month truly noticed. Yeah doubt white house like millions people mass panic. Riots one thing survival panic riots another. I’m honored given 69th upvote comment. Bro numbers much much lower agreed hysterical it. got left behind fanatical fear-porn sub really sanctimonious it. Kisses! “news”? fake news. China fudges numbers, one else.

/s needs publicized instances occuring strike fear God businesses everyone follows rules. Bc premise what's tried VA, yet see businesses skirting rules left right. That’s strange, mate invested TSLA 100k become almost 1M USD. dunno that’s money stolen him. boss sent email asking going coming back entering new phase allowed us re-open. uncomfortable thought phase came soon way worded basically said without outright saying, would fired said replaced waited long. coworker mine requested taken schedule fear contracting Covid forced shut almost got fired &amp; boss viewed really wanting job. Basically beg job upon reopening &amp; started severely, severely reduced hours. us longest &amp; probably best, hardworking &amp; reliable employees. money end day. mean ran child slave factory. Yup. pretty much explanation Bolivian friends well. One huge Morales supporter lost respect changing constitution etc. Looked like mess around. Certainly LAST. faced pandemic far earlier far less known. Overall, he’s saved lives. NY larger percentage drop deaths (so far) state significant cases.  

We’ll see quickly states drop (or don’t) current flare compare. Says governor state 31,000 deaths.

I'd worried deaths increasing cases, especially young. see point fairness listening president trusting CDC guidelines mutually exclusive. CDC drop ball, punted fence. yelling rooftops people listen everyone basically responding ""yeah whatever""

Not sure removed It’s hot hell! SE MI here..I necessarily agree. one highest death rates country long time top 5 terms # cases.  weird lie. Well yea! Gotta keep people shit hole countries (eg., USA) spreading filth everywhere. Yep need start building field hospitals again. hadn’t thought til isn’t nfl training camp supposed start next month? Would interesting Texans stadium used field hospital. Side note actually think American sports path shut back recent surges Walmart, company given thousand dollars worth bonuses since covid started suspended sick time penalties. 

I can’t help dude works shitty location. Sam’s pays great keeps throwing money going work. everyone would wear masks public. It’s much ask. Well, surprising particular spot I’m working hard list scientific research papers show wacky grandparents pandemic serious. lookout message. also general public accustomed term asymptomatic.

I would still listen advice 99% governments.  Work retail also confirm. amount people shopping nuts. Also every day driving home pass pool packed people every road store pass tell anything different. dumb better.. right? plant workers mostly young. know higher asymptomatic rates even symptomatic cases mostly mild.

They interact local community. They're mostly cheap Eastern European labour. work place, sleep eat dorms. Probably social life work long hours earn money send home.

Because live crowded shared dorms, one gets it, spreads like wildfire. see NC government sense SC government. Masks need mandatory everywhere, otherwise everyone wear them. also encouraging everyone wearing one, hate looking like odd one out. biggest failure US response C-19 refusal wear masks initial lockdown - person responsible science-denying occupant WH thinks masks worn ""make look bad."" 

That's political - quite frankly, mental issue well - pandemic get. old fat. needs front damn ass camera every single day life.

You’d know got it. Citation needed.

For what? Cops shitty every nation? Here’s start, feel free browse convenience. Thanks info. Church restaurant make sense. Hope patient zero found eventually. Americans smart. can't comprehend it. Funny exponential growth works. Well most, that’s basically true isn’t it? Three months ago, american idiots full shit claiming twitter US never like [any European country] good are.

When US doubled cases worst hit countries Europe, said comparable number cases per million vastly different.

Now, surpassed amount cases whole old continent show signs stopping it, fact, surging. guess now, evidence can't denied, start ""the virus fake"" ""the numbers fake"" crap. Oh wait, already did. America single handedly responsible second wave word unless band together keep Americans travelling countries.

Fuck America. No. huge “get tested” campaign here. Jim Jones 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue shut there's hardly cases get thanks that, get people saying unnecessary first place. 

It's impossible people deal well without criticised people think load fuss nothing. 

I read comment day said someone said last year America would shut millions people would lose jobs disease 99% survival rate, they'd say mad. sort attitude makes hard people charge government public health get control. time started, recall reading case studies prior pandemics showing areas shut quickly limited spread suffered much less long term economic damage areas businesses kept open “protect” economy. Fortunately, state done good job responding mitigating spread disease, see negative effects addressing situation adequately many areas US. new daily high cases six months pandemic extremely discouraging entirely predictable. “They often do” aren’t fit purpose. said asymptomatic change statement presymptomatic scientific uproar. got wrong. rub you. :-( Democracy mistake Citation needed. I’m working hard list scientific research papers show horny grandparents pandemic serious. lookout message. seems so! Congrats, one dumbest comments ever read Reddit. 

You it! progress made vaccines still think huge potential human challenge trials. Read point hit many deaths world starts seriously consider this? We're quickly approaching half million deaths potential vaccines currently ready phase 3 trials could find quickly worked instead watching world burn. Unfortunately see happening least unless things get much much worse. buckle people. Good advice, go talk folks planetdaily's facebook feed.


Maybe grow well learn theory mind people disagree with. install UV light air conditioners central hvac. think would lessen infection risk.  Cuomo lauded leadership literally sending people death... look statistics, would likely say no. coronavirus victims 70+ retired say. fair enough, take care 124k atm.
Yeah sure it’s gross underestimate continually improving treatment etc.
Don’t get wrong, I’m 150% mask wearing, still, advances science treatment slowing *death* rate. Infection rates rise though idiots mask wearing pretending like covid isn’t threat. Looks like protests time effect infections. Usually takes 2 3 weeks often do, huge organisation. many understand difference two. many arguments February people would use interchangeably, media definitely help using term asymptomatic every time. Haha! seriousness, required, r/Masks4All wants presidency remembered time great economic achievement, virus fit plans. can't control without impacting economy negatively, want decision makes remembered negative impact. Rather lead example, hides behind making personal liberties, leaving ""choice"" contain pandemic individual.  Unfortunately far many people understand risks complex scenario. want term defined crisis can't fix, riddled solutions head November, needs separate policies exist. acknowledges it, take full force. betting presidency going away now, people die scores.... bu least terms.  testing more! /s r/Masks4All \- work! browse around while. There’s stoping virus spreading. People thinking they’re going get coronavirus delusional. thing lockdowns slow spread, can’t stay locked forever. point people rather take risk continue lives rather live homes, jobless constant anxiety. think UK handling well. Brazil one worst, worst. one country actually cop killing problem, weird

No doesn’t. Police problem everywhere exist. anyway, protests brought numbers would seeing NY’s numbers noticeably increasing. aren’t. Something else driving new cases across US. system survive. Unfortunately economy State decided survival essential 200k+ deaths more. People seem forget Spanish flu killed 600k+. internet back than. ignorance bless human nature also. Murica Orange country CA Karens town hall weeks back too. I’ll wear mask chance  Actually, better specialist admits know answer question getting wrong, [like (It video watched months ago, think red bar real number.)

Also, hard low margin error something that's exponential. example, guess anything starts 10000 increase decrease 2% daily, estimate 30 days 5455 18113, ends similar margin error. gas peaceful protest could take picture bible ones handling better Germany, Norway, South Korea, Thailand. testing numbers death rates shows clearly. worst France, UK, Italy, Sweden.
If think way UK handling par better many countries there's point continuing. know numbers, coming from?

It appear random people wanting get tested Hard Rock Stadium, like early on.

Job requirements? Elective surgery? Other? Sorry, know that. Link? breath said one understands difference presymptomatic asymptomatic day after. Monday said asymptomatic, Tuesday said presymptomatic.

Let’s clear make retract statements weekly basis, luckily don’t listen shit advice. going disappear... remotely case. distinction Nevada vs Nevada. order covers ""private businesses"" state. Literally Oregon there's law exempts non-white people wearing masks 

Tell that's giving fuck public lmao Limiting bars 75% capacity, whatever ambiguous %, actually kind ridiculous. lot bars patroned pandemic never 75% capacity... furthermore, usually part restaurant! restaurant stops serving food people clear out, bars capacity greatly increases! people drinking going go sit tables, usually standing around bar yelling loud music! that, handwashing social distancing bathroom open trough basically non-existent esp someone 4+ drinks... establishment may 75% capacity, still going mass chaos. also help people literally places. ""Social Distancing"" ""Going Bar"" polar opposite activities.

Ok Fake news! Nobody knows 19 means. people say immigrant gang thing. Murderous immigrant gangs Chyna stop tremendous wall. mean need pants? want gun pants right out. many 0.5% figure, healthy adults 50?

Im serious, kinda matters show actually pertains everyone. wish didnt matter, realistic aka okay understand DV good casinos considered ""in Nevada"" governor really set good example wearing mask funeral. Yes, wearing masks part partisan politics, nothing public health /s trans person, careful shit. family invested gender ended friends family. American spirit seen America WWI, WWII, depression, recession, 9/11, middle eastern wars still alive deep inside souls American Patriots (not confused American ethnocentrics) hope. seem forget difference something unknown something happening. absolutely doubt mind stragglers currently spreading virus, like Beijing. We'll see. gave something like 65k 69k mean death toll simulations. Mind you, 95% confidence interval pretty wide, upper bound around 115-120k.

Basically 67k plus minus 50k?

That's like 80% margin error.

When 95% confidence interval wide relative mean, raising bells people err side caution. suggests high degree uncertainty figure. Even 67k plus minus 7k (margin error \~10%) feel like fool trusting experts rather intuition, turns much closer mark. nothing else, shows limitations modeling novel phenomenon (the virus) interacts complex system (the United States). Unfortunately also puts dent credibility experts.

The experts likely based models typically rational public response pandemic (most people wearing face masks social distancing non-compliant individuals sprinkled in). Unfortunately us, American exceptionalism struck (with regards mask-wearing social distancing lack thereof), made model applicable us. Friday night Seoul, it’s unusual see streets near Gangnam Station empty. neighbourhood famed club scene, [South endures second wave Covid-19 infections, gatherings banned, affecting 2,000 bars clubs.

I’m server Scottsdale every table east coast LA visiting wanted badly... Well, gonna spend two years muzzled. Thats sure. Brilliant Surgeons jocks medical profession. German study two weeks ago even said homemade face mask lowers risk 40%. Add 2 meters spacing even less.

Of course always people deny reality party hard groups. one blaming retards rioting rising numbers, blame everywhere shifted white people Trump anywhere look. 

Hypocrites Doc's fault trying get OG Marty back boat. always scared crazy world event prevented children wanted. finally worked confidence bam pandemic. make worse country dealing worse country. Embarrassing, scary, ridiculous. problem. WEAR FUCKING MASK. fREedOm wah wah wah. Americans straight fucking stupid can't handle anymore. PA, things kind 50/50 area people look crazy bc wear mask. Thankfully work still requires one, outaide people seem care, first complain lockdowns. morons, everywhere. cleary since already spiking. country. One country's parties. look cities like New York, Philadelphia, Chicago, etc. see tests increasing rates decreasing despite huge populations. 

Then look places certain politicians pushing masks, social distancing...
Cases spiking health officials panicking. parts country less eradicated infections. things places common. anus* cruise ships land. aint going anywhere soon, mentality would wear forever.

Until vaccination rolled mid-2022, yes. 40,000 yes still hasnt case community transmission. seem forget eventually even asymptomatic transfer result symptomatic case somewhere hasnt happened. Blonde looks like cutie pie. didn't. MSM journalist quoted that, came said that's true, news outlet issued retraction. Bill Gates\` latest 5G Covid Spreader else think? question is: understand? Resign MFer. That's cases deaths though. also strongly suggests Brazil ubderreoprted deaths. also much behind curve. Comparing cases deaths together nothing show testing.

UK cases/tests = 306k/8500k

If think way Brazil handling par better many countries there's point continuing. I've wondering weeks...  Well certain case closed it. Good job NZ. bacardi stopped making 151 tired getting sued fire.

other people make 151 rum though. benefits this? 10 days ago number infections started spike again. see death following couple days. want throw party high-five other. Well quite 100%. close. government also aggressive contact tracing, mandated travelers quarantine return tracking daily checkups, protocols developed prior experience SARS.

They also immediately started ramping mask production, manned machines military. made enough ration masks every one Taiwan's citizens weekly basis.

They starting JANUARY. Historically, rental markets done well economic downturns. Evictions foreclosures lead large surge people need housing can't qualify buy. Look back 2008 - housing market brutal, rent prices never even blinked. problem sharing. greedy would fine. Karen wild bullshit lol. 

I stopped reading downvoted. think point coming soon response spray fire extinguisher everybody gets close us. allow choice employment health insurance tied job? speed limits traffic laws either. impinge freedom. needs armed occupation like guy roaming county giving tickets ready blow heads off.

Marijuana - choice
Gambling - choice
Paying taxes - choice
Abortion - choice
Kneeling anthem - choice

The hypocrisy charts. Sure buddy. That’s it’s rising south northeast. Makes perfect sense lol worried

What mean?  liberal media? joke? I’ve waiting John’s Hopkins refresh data. officially insane now. many packed firework shows scheduled around country. Yeah, worried definitely stay home. photo, midst pandemic, says Oh Trump held rally Phoenix yesterday crowd 3k+.

Lmao really blaming Trump rally literally weeks mass protests? need instill fear. trump well enough.

cnn's goal make money. Even though everyone best stay socially distant, Barbosa said enough. ""It long. couple hours,"" Barbosa, volunteer EMT said. ""But brief time, somehow 18 family members infected COVID."" Barbosa's parents much tougher situation. Carole hospitalized since June 13, Frank hospital since June 17. Frank ICU life support. Barbosa told WFAA inches away put ventilator. ""My dad's hanging thread,"" Barbosa said. ""They're saying one last straws dad."" guess best point already passed Influenza. think lower data points could removed higher could added highlight COVID already catching big killers getting started. Can't argue stupid. people around silicon Valley generally smarter Ya put risk. Howver delivery properly, ordered first time ever frrom Ubereats never called buzzed apartment, waited hours food never came. gaveup reported ubereats issued refund. fewhoursi still really hungry decided leave building pick something up. Found food ground sidewalk. left there. ready give extra tip cash well missed that, contact delievery okay arent consistant it. They'll fine. US rental market remains strong, historically, economic downturns good rental markets fewer people qualify buy. Really fitting analogy all. Inhale deeply  shown account 7% deaths. would tell better story compared bigger killers, maybe that's impractical now. weaponize covid? Meanwhile, rest world (except USA, Russia, Brazil) follow advice medical experts.

????? 1) rental markets strong across US. Vacancies generally filled days, sometimes hours.
 
2) vacant property infinitely better property non-paying renter it. Either way, amount revenue, deadbeat tenant, landlord needs concerned utilities, maintenance, damage, vandalism theft. Thought wrong sub second. sure r/Coronavirus? crazy, 0911 comparison 3000 Americans died big big deal reason enough go made war. amount people die every week turned business usual.  Someone thinks it’s good idea give people like automatic weapons, flak jackets, old army equipment patrol streets looking speeders. That's pretty frustrating think clear general sentiment. sub nature going track lot people, especially people want downplay longer goes on. 

Now we're seeing things spike up, makes sense restrictions come back conversations. ""Sorry, locked keys planes. Oops! See 2021!"" *Hulas away* virus takes way longer tham 2 weeks meme show data. Blame government.  Nothing 2/3 government working Fox News purposely misreporting try protect Republicans. 

All wait inevitable mass deflation bailout bubble bursts unlimited trillions relief real option. think stock markets safe kidding yourself. floating bailout money that's ending month plan anything bout lies denial.

I suggest hoarding money jobs could collapse faster think systemic failure dominoes country. High population density areas worked hard limit virus going put constant risk lack government action public responsibility. 

People react money runs out. sense aggressive initial bailout, funding virus mitigation. loose money made people think things much better really reacting like going go away soon.

Most people also realize high chance re-infection course months end year vaccine sure thing, probably slow distribute pretty high chance requiring booster shots probably last long hoped. many people even scientists foolishly assumed would long term immunity, coronaviruses produce strong/long lasting immunity cases. Re-infection always higher probability guesstimation. Anybody talking long term immunity herd immunity even bother educate Wikipedia knowledge level, less acting like experts field.

The scientific conclusions know it'll probably similar coronavirus, means short lived antibodies long term immunity potentially harder make vaccines virus changing nearly rapidly flu (which flu needs new vaccines often). Flu reacts ideally vaccines, partly long term antibodies immune stain flu potentially entire life. Coronavirus MUCH different though accomplishes goal avoiding antibody problem, far direct method leaving behind long lived antibodies, seems like neat trick potentially problematic vaccine creation vaccine longevity least. 

The upside mutate fast FLU chance controlling significantly vaccine vs coming back every year like flu. However think mass distribution prove fast, least get level herd immunity keep long enough ensure circulation. also deal simple fact infectious flu small pockets get eradicated still easily causes outbreaks fairly short period time.

The solution? WEAR MASKS. repertory infection, knock infection rate WAY masks hand washing effect near immediate unlike pretty much every option. solution people brains yelling since February. 

I bet efforts combined less effective everybody wore masks working conditions adapted new reality..like people working hot conditions get breaks ventilation make wear masks, ideally money too, that's nearly necessary since raise make immune heatstroke. rights? takin' away freedoms? cough cough. 'red'iculous. can't breathe mask... cough cough Another trump failure then!  would agree you. I'm Spain, way back middle March said wife US would devastated this. Took longer expected honest. Please wear masks guys, work. areas. Rental markets across US strong vacancies generally filled within days - sometimes hours. Please! stop buying US products vote cheese doodle office! none haters would ever result would beautiful 40k cases 1100 deaths guess drink enough alcohol kill virus huh Source? Hahahajahahaffhghhaa US far diverse big answer this. me, healthy mid 20s male Pacific Northwest, I'm scared sbitless disappointed country. mid 50s Midwest empty nester couple, ecstatic get 1000 dollars week unemployment love trump back road rallies declaring victorious covid $1200 stimulus check supposed pay rent expenses. supposed to.. stimulate.. economy. additional $2,400 per month top state unemployment dollars unemployed people pay rent expenses. Public health issues inherently political. Whenever decisions gets made, that's politics. first 12 stories BLM/statue/Seattle DMZ stories - it’s fair point. completely agree assessment Chinese government. However, disagree point since Chinese government mostly done bad things, cannot anything good. devil deals absolute. ok acknowledge good deeds.

I also agree theory, decentralized approach much better centralized one, since open diversity innovation. However, two points:

1. Public health matter democracy. Decentralized approach work. Polio eradicated people want vaccination could so. Typhoid Mary put isolation rest life wanted to. public health, public good goes personal liberty. centralized approach work. look China response pandemic think China bad. Look Italy response case explosion. Look another autocratic government transparent government like Singapore. Look Iceland response. Robust, centralized, disciplined response keeps disease overwhelming medical resources. ""Flatten curve"" speak.

2. Democracy - philosophical. agree democracy long run would outdo every system. America even close democracy. Without well-informed population, cannot functioning democracy. mob rule populist rule.

To last point risk old preexisting conditions group. wrong there. way disease affects people, healthy sick, absolutely bonker. I'm healthcare I've seen healthy cases stuck ICU one two months. That's normal. Usually people get ICU one way (well) another (dead) weeks, lingering months.

Let's assume hypothesis risk group correct (the elderly typical diabetic/hypertensive patients). Even patients get sick enough get admitted, healthcare system cannot cope rapid rise cases. system can. See Italy [their anesthetists prioritize intubation/ICU - essentially forced hand death sentence patients 60 patients preexisting conditions. Look New York stories. lot well/non-COVID people also die due treatable disease, hospital cannot accommodate them. Think young patients perforated appendix, delayed surgical treatment newly diagnosed cancer, run mill myocardial infarction stroke, car crash bad fractures. cases may get adequate care. admitted hospitals, congratulation, also get COVID now. else? getting COVID ""preexisting condition"".

It difficult wrap heads around fact may vaccine horizon. normality returns, ever? Unfortunately, healthcare systems plan future. Many governments foresight planning contingencies. one who's going grain Sweden. see doing.

So, may forfeit freedom common good sooner later. people care suffer. Public health hard. might little that, Stuttgart Munich ;) can't believe people down-voting facts here, dedicated coronavirus sub. I'm going repost thoughtful analysis.

Actually also blaming wrong people. Look timeline, knowing 11.4±3 day delay events reported infection showed change points spreading rate affect confirmed case numbers delay two weeks (median reporting delay D=11.4 days plus median change-point duration 3 May 18, Florida's 67 counties Full Phase 1 reopening. state entered first phase limited reopening May 4. Palm Beach County entered Phase 1 May 11. Miami-Dade Broward counties approved enter Phase 1 May 18.

Also Memorial Day Weekend (which often blamed) ended May 25

But largest spike cases actually seven day moving average number new COVID-19 cases increased 1269 June 11 2408 June 18, 2020

So means significant cause must occurred earlier May 28 (factoring standard deviation)

What started suddenly May 28? haha let’s put successful Asian countries there. 

Europe bad, America everything wrong. subreddits dying  That's biggest fear bars restaurants, dirty dishes utensils. Rental markets extremely strong. Demand almost absurdly high, vacancies filled days - sometimes hours. Landlords every reason quickly evict non-paying tenants. isn’t ignoring it! He’s slowing testing means fewer cases! /s right...

&amp;#x200B;

Someone keeps telling voters kill themself (Masks farce, Social distancing useless...). loosing votes Wait? 44 deaths? That’s actually bad turn around leave dive science experiment?   
You don’t go in. Yes. weeks ago constant ""this sub loves doom gloom"" top every topic going become like metric system MM/DD/YY. ones? lot benefited lockdowns states don’t support cheese doodle would subject DOJ scrutiny. Florida similar executive order weeks. Yep, that's I've seen. Rental availability practically zero. New openings leased days - sometimes hours. rental market strong ever. Putin cronies looted billions dollars hospital system 1990s supposedly upgrading &amp; modernizing

The country way prepared this- wouldn’t trust numbers release either post post without words 'flagged'. I've done I've also started reporting automoderator removing 'purely political posts' damned thing! Half boubonic plague modern times would completely destroy world economy start numerous global conflicts wars famines cause pain suffering unlike world ever seen. People incredibly stupid. 1% already thrown world global recession. imagine even 5%. I'm talking general yea definitely true. Oh fuck's sake! Yeah know right side it. speaking generally agreement you.

And 100% agree that, it, aren't. least thus far. seeing lot greenhouse factory farming, making better use land. I've seen much way vertical farms thus far, economics probably justify yet except extremely limited circumstances. I'm sure many wipe back front too. sub specifically? I'm consistently I'm talking I've seeing site general. have, Democrat would ever result would beautiful supposed go 9 15 September, going reschedule late next year. I'm bloody impressed could type many political words without triggering automod. Bad bot. Meanwhile something necessary. evidence coronavirus spread via groceries. even mention Montana, beacuse lot places big Arenas even professional sports teams.

Hey clear, obviously people follow wrestling, they've taping shows ""Performance Center"" really large gym. still managed screw up. Fingers crossed. bought last house 2008 less third sold 2005 sold 2014 huge profit. I'd love repeat move! people believe God save Corona virus also say need AR-15 protect burglers? different constitution. movement states US can't taken away Killed JFK *and* every animal Zodiac. Impressive. R indicator current spread, also highly suspectible regional isolated outbreaks. example scenario zero existing cases one new case first day 5 new cases second day, R 5, automatically mean spread control? No, isolated R meaningful, combined numbers aggregation give additional insight infection curve. stupid shit people sometimes make wish born elsewhere 😭 else people going? Lol everything else closed. 



No masks restaurants outside make we,as long going ppl corona social/family circles (aka ppl see live - small group) distance maintained strangers. 


People yelling people sitting restaurant tables wearing masks ridiculous (gotta eat drink)


So whenever see comment like reddot, assume one ppl taking far. Nice try Winnie 👍 quite. include capital gains, 1% probably lose still lose much everyone else. People often say thing talking 2009, yet, decade since, 1% income group whose median income still recovered.

So crazy lizard people-esque conspiracy true, is? Well, public health terms virus consideration anymore. There's pretty even consensus quarantining prevent COVID deaths there've difficulties trying reconcile health impact virus health impact job loss. people still want lockdown. don't. live modestly expensive complex (roughly 3x cost 'cheap' apartments around me) talking property manager yesterday. said never low vacancy rate. Roughly 200 units one vacant property. One. rental market pretty well vantage point. fuck Russia common European Union? War? uncle doctor. answers better surprised since know lot work places people tested positive, yet places still open. lockdown place don’t care gets people mad again. one trying rush flu vaccine door keep rich people rich. France probably best healthcare world virus still found way wreak havoc. Fuck it. I'm gona create Brawndo Inc. bad trend. say ""Thank God Mississippi"" South nothing. close eyes it’ll go away Think moment, number coming from; particulars facts predicated. insufficient testing contact tracing, what’s going stop it?

Or even slow one country actually cop killing problem, weird  ""being smart"" sadly missing people. Sorry, brown enough terrorism charges. even TX?

If know im right sounds exactly like actions typical CA school administrator. think like, reckless actions could cause potential deaths infections people around so... experienced Tuesday Wednesday last week.

But deaths lagging indicator. early say, unfortunately. WE'RE # 1 

U A!

U A! Maybe 2 5, even paces it’s required. 

I hate state. get news updates Reddit, probably warped view actually happening. feel like insane one subreddit full hysterical people represent rest society. people sub arent woke, they're obsessive. heartbreaking think tone might someone numb death amount he’s seen. one numbed family members death look age range body weight average NFL Head Coach Assistant Coach, really bode well could happen outbreak occurs. giving much credit bro We'll make man! much people could blame Trump,

If Donald went said ""Make America Wear Masks Again"" handed-out Trump 2020 masks many people refusing wear one would. Liberal voices even agree point. protesting costume? Ah, taking high road wishing sickness death someone never met. Yes, let concern opinion. We’ve one stimulus $1,200, that’s it.

That $1200 stimulus check weird amount. people water financially, buys weeks best. people sufficient financial buffers, stimulus impact.

The group people $1200 stimulus turning point trouble holding probably exceptionally small. believe counting UK graph, potentially Russia. people herds herd immunity requires vaccine, right? You’ll probably survive - you’d scarred lungs compromised immune system rest life. Yikes Whats new RW media. true, nobody drank enough bleach died coronavirus trust tell he's biting tongue. telling us? US soon FUBAR - failed state Lmao. Disney shouldn’t even considering reopening right put misleading since person posted lie?

Under hot topics, currently second three, ""Coronavirus"". There's news stories moment related front page. 

[This link news articles related COVID-19, looks updated moment write this, Ezekiel Elliot's health update, death forecast October, Cesaer's Palace making face coverings mandatory response Nevada declaring masks must worn public times, Chuck E. Cheese filing bankruptcy partially COVID-19, Hawaii including pre-travel testing option beginning August 1st...

Moral story: automatically assume something true proven wrong 30 seconds looking site. say all! That’s easy. can’t that. might number unicorns needed produce vaccine. road trip middle nowhere would fine probably. road trip major city/tourist destination absolutely Ehh reaching. far strongest comment is, ""wear damn mask"" 


Then he's saying informed. Whatever. hope virus takes care reckless people like sigh Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Effectively handling pandemic easy. takes great political courage shut maintain restrictions economy.

This administration never task. way american way.. arms! automoderator quite broken, fix please. anything likely spread based fact hands, feet, etc constantly mouths general child behaviors. 

Maybe likely catch reason? I’m unsure. Lawmakers could likely saved countless lives. Another massive failure American government. Trump said would send checks he's allowed put signature foreheads. Because, know, money. miss scorpion bowls. R/woosh? thought people proud freedom think themselves. Obviously wrong. Make sure visit family friends leave *kappa* American parties this, no. Seriously, say amount stupidity?!

Given rules express ... lack sympathy family. hope noone dies though. literally never seen happen. can't imagine bar economically failing running things drink of. I'm talking herd immunity. type message wish leaders sides would actually present. “How many lives would willing give football games Sunday?”

America: “Whatever takes” It’s right thing (whether it’s patriotic idk) try help fellow community members could catch virus survive. Stupid stupid does. Trump probably already received vaccine, antibody injections, something nature. I'm sure gets wants time, unfortunately. $80 ticket spent 4 months ago tangible $800 might lose get covid

But takes strong logic get past argument It’s recommendation encouraging advice, order. Sounds like wanna complain. 


Hes giving advice. qualifier wear damn mask comment that's decided take it. r/wallstreetbets slow boring tonight, it? here. Casual click articles Covid-19 among others first view. public health issue, inherently political. made political one can't named. Change rules mods! I'm smh asking I'm needlessly marooning family 600 sqft apartment.

Yes. sub icon surprised pikachu point Essential services need remain open like going 100 different supermarkets middle pandemic NEED specific cookie. can't survive another cookies? without them? People wants everything, willing sacrifice literally anything, cookies crowd. need fucking crowd, need grow adapt temporary situation. right bleach though. though. 0,7 today. movement huge even numbers hundreds. forget talking country 80+ million inhabitants. Yup real surprised bad there. Yeah could bad especially zero support. end day, long taking precautions coming contact they’re actually favour. 

The best hope people get virus, become asymptomatic mild symptoms get herd immunity without spreading many people. Peoples social bubbles big. think healthcare system shows cracks pandemic? creator know use spell check. face shield n95 would protected. don’t think it’s worth risk honestly cut hair wearing mask Oh god dammit! (sweet dee voice) ""Schneider outspoken critic of childhood vaccinations, believing cause autism"" Japan shut events schools quite soon cruise boat made everyone paranoid. still lockdown here, waiting excess death counts see really happened.

 Also, mask wearing went up, buy recently. 

 However, think played part. nothing else increase wearing shows people taking seriously, whereas badly hit western places take seriously all. also say asymptomatic spread was/is happening Sup, Europe here, thx making us look good once. seriousness: actual fuck, get shit together there. O.o)  Joy Laughter Coughs phone? Let's go Dude! know second shutdown would extremely hard do. first one first ever. people time get used idea know handle it. course it'll take runaway increases happen, think happen spikes we're seeing. Large numbers cases even cases.

The first shutdown give us time learn virus prepare hospitals manufacture PPE. second one curb hospitals morgues overrun government utterly failed prepare first shutdown. 

I think second shutdown works there's vaccine horizon though, otherwise people say what's point. no, means keep reasonable distance wear mask stay outside. we're getting harm reduction stage this. get social time fucking freezing out.  war room....they tight. Uh huh. I'll get one go public urination card Uromysitisis. /entitlement Reddit’s obsession praising objectively shitty person always pathetic. that’s true: Society social media hopefully job... also international hub, one densely populated , among first cases. Granted , 0 support guidance initially federal government. Yes nursing home choice costed lives , subsequent actions NY took prevented becoming much much worse. look trend vs states. I'd bet NYC ends better major cities US, notably Houston, LA, Phoenix, Miami. need review data, wasn’t something like 6 - 8 weeks lockdown even drive curve down? ""Page found."" think president calling ""fake"" weeks really helped us  Sounds like Goodyear, done jack shit us. 4 cases haven’t heard updates weeks. lot shady shit going around companies. exactly closed?

minds... Oh absolutely, way Bill Gates collossal asshole nasty piece work wrecking alot livelihoods Microsoft. 

However also spending fortune trying eradicate malaria amongst humanitarian projects. raises bit quandary whether good someone outweighs negative.

Bringing back Musk, maybe collossal asshole work for. reason humans become multi planetary species, catalyst EVs one break internet monopolies, outweigh shitty boss. See NYC numbers. test per capita world. Texas governor fail implement policies, lambasted counties tried implement mask ordinances, he's blaming Dallas county judge ""rounding people jail"" (which damn lie) reason can't mask mandates. Wasn’t caught hot mic saying going lot cases reopening started? It’s combination both. Based numbers Covidtracking.com, average positive rate last week 4.6%. raises 6% week. Note national average. positive rates northeastern states dropping, meaning positive rates southern states raising even more. 

For example, AZ went 16.6% last week 23.9% week, FL went 7.4% positive last week 14.4% positive week, TX went 7.9% last week 11.4% week. bad TX looks, largest population among three. would worry AZ most, followed FL.  Politicians think either keeping strong economy healthy population. reality situation way nation's economy remain stable nations influence economy also remain stable. I'm 3rd gen UAW worker, never heard 15 calls offs reset 90 days. sure thinking FMLA? 5 call days period. 

It sounds like leadership shit though regressing contracts, best part union democracy. like current leadership, vote out. Pretty sure shop process cleaning house upcoming election. They’re asked enforce it. whole burden businesses require customers wear masks. Law enforcement enters customer asked leave refuses; cited trespassing. Same. Scientists rather engineer analyse data find conclusion. right wrong rather ""what mean?"" ya dummy Ask Mortician whole three-part series macabre side Disneyland, one people spread ashes rides there. really interesting actually (if stuff).  Target list. Grand Canyon’s entire men’s basketball team placed quarantine four players two support staff members tested positive COVID-19. Bezos without dick pics leaked Fucking idiots. Fire them, shame them, let hold power form, ever again. 

Just stupidity absolute worst. hope recover month illness remorse tell everyone see horrible disease people believe start taking precautions. Texas could bad shape soon. I'm sorry hear feeling lonely.

Get better soon. think called ""Woody Allen Syndrome"". Yeah, statistically people age group hospitalized would jump anyone looked stats Arizona. Right 57 people 20 whole state hospitalized COVID Arizona since February. 5 came party would 1. statistically incredibly rare 2. big enough store would make sort new could trace back to.

But since evidence, guess believe random redditor. like anyone reddit ever made anything before. will, huh???

oh yeah....we will...... says everything:
""You told people state, told people country, White House, ‘Don’t worry it. open up, go business, Democratic hyperbole,'” Cuomo said. “Oh, really? see 27 states numbers going up. see death projections going up. see economy going down. never politics. always science. denial, denial life strategy.”

Even seeing happened northeast, GOP governors south still pushed ""no worse flu"" narrative. politicizing virus, top down, leave us many dead terrible lung scarring, precisely anti-science movement taken hold among conservatives. hope one good outcome covid learning trust science again. learning mainstream media fake news. combination two ills deadly virus. rebuttal.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* would like claim biased ever speak Sweden's favor, hi. Nope, robust Test, Trace, Isolate infrastructure. Also, diseases (thankfully) seem diffuse spreading pattern like flu rather spreads cluster outbreaks. much easier contain TTI flu.

So sure *in theory* anything possible things unlikely epidemiologists think Nordics TTI big second wave, rather small ""ripples"" aka cluster outbreaks quickly contained.

ETA: Swedish translates very, well cases. use translator oyu want read article. literally says “second”. means 2, equal shit ton. least 100,000 Americans dead, 10s thousands dead countries. mention fact pneumonia deaths least threefold, lot states. state, Tennessee, 1,700 pneumonia deaths, mid May. 5 year average 600. probably 1,500 Covid deaths here, even though we’re reporting fewer 600. Realistically, could quarter million dead Americans end year, due Covid. Hell, could close right now. something isn’t smallpox, doesn’t mean isn’t serious. Dude im mexico, americans would call third world country aka shithole people taking serious. cant go supermarket, fruit store, building, 711, without mask. wont let even throw tantrum, people dont, wear mask.

Im actually surprised handling this. president idiot course, refuses wear mask reasons trump, people general right, couple incidents people refusing wear masks caught camera exposed national level, feel like helped lot making people wear damn mask lol. Yes. enough. sun belt wanted play game really didnt understand rules. Elon Musk really gone deep end.  Hey guys! idea!

Let's wear masks! Im sorry TX/AZ/FL going ""getting handle"" things now.

Texas here, know, lot us yelling governor's decisions going fuck us over, even lockdown order managed delay things month. bad here, COVID political culture awful. told literally go die save economy we're yelled people get back restaurants bars. governor blaming (Dallas) county judge ""rounding people jail"" wearing masks (absolutely true), that's can't mask mandate. completely gross incompetence. Wonderful headline, managing use ""Virus"" ""plagued"" Again, implying cost loss personal pleasure. would highly privileged clueless unaware costs people face. I'm making cost:benefit analysis, I'm saying one made. saying real cost. 

Oh even person talking to. Well, I'm gonna bang head wall today. good one. considered it, doubt would provide positive result recent reports antibodies fade 3 months. event, live state without widespread antibody testing. live California. reminds Rebekah Jones issue Florida fault. bet completely Newsom, we'd never eased lockdowns we'd still locked months. unfortunately, state fair share ""FREE-DUMB"" fighters complain masks lockdowns leftist conspiracies think Covid-19 sham. federal government teeter-totters back forth wanting fight Covid-19 time make light wants economy back feet. always going losing battle.

Newsom best without support, full lock never going happen forever. knew would case China managed lock Wuhan. knew thing could never happen here.

Well, surprise, that's sure. one socially distant photo, inside building wearing masks. shocking surprise. Probably long term health effect COVID, posts subreddit talk long term effect lung patients mildly ill recovered COVID okay? Let know spot mistranslations I'll fix them. saying suffer. many videos people sitting outside. Compared closing completely that't still big difference.

Says person referencing tweets cold hard sources Coming someone fertility issues started trying last year, empathy. people happened get lucky earlier get babies people unlucky don't. stable jobs incomes, lots savings, act responsibly cautiously. order understand look Amazon.

When Amazon first started late 90's took made profit, making billions profit require little capital grow. Bezos hailed visionary genius investors.
Because Amazon invested heavily sales software engineering cannot capitalized, real profits sort hidden. Amazon stock actually went 100x past decades.

So started hunt 'the next Amazon'. made people realize company always turn profit first, might mean simply investing growth way cannot capitalized.

So capitalized mean? Let's say buy car rent out, depreciate 10 years. means upfront cost car show profit loss statement. 1/10th (the depreciation charge). factories, real estate, equipment, boats etc. spent let's say $1 million software development research development past year, often 100% accounted Profit loss statement. Even though code probably last longer 1 year. true profitability hidden.

So could Tesla (and many vaguely tech companies like example WeWork) profit this? Everyone chasing next Amazon! Profit longer mattered. Cult personality matters. Fast revenue growth matters. wanted next Bezos.

This actually created bad incentives, companies straight selling product service cost create really 'fake growth', raise prices cost make it, revenue probably come way *cough Uber cough*.

So right loads 'next Amazon' companies way overpriced making profit. investors eating up. 

The problem Tesla lot investment costs actually depreciated, excuse 'well spending R&amp;D lose money' good excuse.

BLM Marxists criminals immune apparently, white people spreading virus. Yes. yet don’t hear anyone calling shoplifters “illegals”. arsonists, racists, murderers. least them, people refer crime committed. least know society isn’t referring “man”, “woman”, “person” terms acknowledge humans by.

I’d even cool “illegal immigrant”. It’s least descriptive crime lost privilege acknowledging humanity. 

I don’t know people insist referring groups illegals. don’t know it’s much effort say word “immigrant”. guess maybe folks lazy it’s much effort acknowledge someone human?

Or maybe it’s Americans remember we’re generations away immigrants. people recognize country built immigrants. cowardly person wanted dehumanize large group minorities, would hard acknowledged crime immigrating.

It could also people don’t really pay much attention actual meaning phrases say repeat hear others without consideration. I’m hoping you’re group maybe help better refer others bare minimum humanity. Best wishes! ""It long. couple hours,"" Barbosa, volunteer EMT said. ""But brief time, somehow 18 family members infected COVID.""

Somehow? We're middle raging pandemic, perplexed ""somehow"" 18 family members infected? use airpods? Wires hassle. Two things. testing rate actually consistently higher Germany's. Secondly went lockdown tighter Germany ever did, tighter European country except Spain, went 2 cases community transmission. last recorded case community transmission late April. widespread sentinel testing random people country certain zero community transmission. scary part, people get tested whenever feel symptoms, point spread virus people already well. Without proper contact tracing virtually impossible stop increase transmissions. 

So takes ICU's overrun make US citizens aware severity problem, already late. karma, wasted. get *beautiful* tests country? ugly. due fly Spain Orlando tomorrow 4-week vacation. Cancelled back April. Hopefully next year. Yeah, fucked already please save yourselves. „Ok Sir, currently two options.“

„What options?“

„A) something. B)..)

Disney give AF Orlando says. safe reopen. island , limited entry points , question mark...  countries avoid inbound outbound flights especially country receiving inbound flights quarantine measures flight. Another far brazen flaunting disregard social distancing getting *far* attention and, unlike Trump, nearly universal *praise* Yes, coverups putting people boxes. last.

Republican policy might lead reduction abortions depends mean weather. UV light humidity proven impact it. Doesn’t look like warmer temperatures make difference though (other people outside it’s harder contract). soon... Denmark's population density: 347 people per square mile (134 people per square kilometer).

Norway's population density: 38 people per square mile (15 people per square kilometer).

Finland's population density: 47 people per square mile (18 people per square kilometer).

Denmark's population density \~9 times higher Norway's \~7.5 times higher Finland's. expected also higher number deaths per capita. gender reveal parties freakin dumb. WTF Look worldometers.

3 months since deaths started gain significance. There’s guarantee likely ok. I’m super paranoid went salon fine. literally first day back work I’ve gone 4 months. know cast members say think going open. shit show far guests masks. *Europe, Trump tries get Scottish golf course*: fast.... chief virologist germany said money freedom trace #SARS-Cov2 china would go ""livestock"" notfood markets. breeding farms enviroment provides nursing niche animal workers infection. 8est, think. resets midnight GMT Less testing find bandana old t-shirt? think played part. 

Can talk variables controlled forming opinion? want compare scientific study. blame failed government leadership healthcare worker \*should\* able protect themselves, massive issues PPE available them. Testing capacity (reagents kits)remains places, small outbreak market overwhelm said capacity. big outbreak(which unlikely everyone still toes), they'll mobilize medical resources like first wave. Japan also got control better. percentage positive cases tests Brazil 40%. shows still sickest tested widespread testing begun. Thats believe virus also spreading cities. lol happen! hospitals cancel almost non Covid-19 related services procedures, think outcome? 

Honestly? wish well pregnancy. due November seriously hope NZ resurgence cases ( given politicians agitating open border businesses wants border open ) 


As people caring people .. hate break .. people care family further. tends happen broken local social contract due excessive mass immigration. sad thing usa also massive problem virus vaccine it, hundreds thousands people millions people go hospital hundreds thousands od dollars hospital bills per person, also something wish happen chance happening monetisation vaccine instead giving free They’ll called coomers post misleading showing causes death less COVID - whole point.

As side note, shocked found many deaths caused accidents US. thought lot Australia, US really something else contribution many just1 person awarding entire amount pockets. people see good act deserves monetary reward, people pitch small amounts, know it, grow. Look way. karen owned parlor business complained closed something due quarantine restrictions gained like 6 digits mulah. definitely deserve wrong. well getting slightly better last ditch hospital treatments curb death rate 1000 per day might go slightly 

but alternative lifelong complications crippling fatigue many months afterwards going small prize survivors, covid also activate lifelong thyroid diabetes problems previously healthy individuals

we need next-level masks, 3M R95s billions billions stockpiles need cheaply available public, hospitals well overstocked masks construction division medical go large public gathering then, no? Like every LA protestor quarantined? article Saint-Petersburg. Physician here.

It's astonishing ignorant people comes face masks.

Here perfect example [I expressed concern Home Depot sub saw front door greeter wearing know, ONE person almost every customer pass enter store.

This month ago.

Some genius thread goes rant masks makes reference single article ""peer reviewed scientific article regarding biologic viral pathogen protection 3m masks"", yet astonishingly **doesn't provide source.**

So genius provide following:

- [**Proceedings National Academy ""We conclude wearing face masks public corresponds effective means prevent interhuman transmission""

- [**JOHN HOPKINS**: Lisa Maragakis, M.D., M.P.H., expert infection ""Face masks help prevent spread COVID-19.""

- [**STANFORD:** Amy Price, PhD, senior research scientist Stanford’s Anesthesia Informatics Media Laboratory, Larry Chu, MD, professor anesthesia director AIM Laboratory.](http://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2020/06/stanford-scientists-contribute-to-who-mask-guidelines.html) ""cloth masks slow spread disease"" I’m Central Florida...good you. It’s real mess frankly I’d rather CO too. really need TP-tracker dashboard 7-day filtered poops/day IHME model projections. wonder people taking social distancing seriously could thought covering entrance exit virus would stop it. UK. knew Chinese match world-beating technology, world-leading scientists great NHS, BoJo told us so, boasted shook hands everyone met. month later leading world ineptitude needless deaths. virus almost perfect. hardest working president ever okey? needs time! sure 45000 deal. America brøthër! /s Sadly, that’s surprise point.  think I'd say best world, experienced 3 them, including France. it’s worth support extending outer border closure.

I issue US imposing ban Europeans travelling US, know international arrivals big source transmission, need stop spread returning EU. 

The EU needs work tackle one, far linked terms borders, trade population. Reopening flights world doesn’t help countries, could help ease burden rest world sure, isn’t going suddenly help stop spread, spread further. Normal folks: ""What little fun summer..."" 


Quarantine enthusiasts muzzlers: ""NO FUN ALLOWED! BLOOD, SWEAT TEARS!!!"" makes 3rd leading cause death USA, behind cancer heart disease. Im saying deserve type reward 16k? That's bit much 1 person job Can't believe people still paying attention computer models past several months shown wildly inaccurate. Even researchers suggesting 180,000 Americans die October decreasing numbers time goes on, people still listen them? Lol White people Texas special kind stupid. benefit people get karens, make real heroes shine. uptick cases people returned work protesting started Well deserved opinion. Man job right thing. need part pandemic all. Yeah difference 'less' 'lower'. 


Suppose number x


100 times lower x would (x/100) (0.01x)


99% x would (0.99x). 
The number 99% less x would (x - 0.99x) (0.01x)

Both mean same.


As writing this, realised might wrong reason makes sense me. Happy cake day BTW. 


Being risk analyst PhD philosophy, short paper that. kind evaluations important planning, go window faced unknown new threat depend human behaviour. 


My point stoicism Marcus Aurelius better adapted traditional risk analysis, ie:


We have:


the serenity accept things cannot change;



the courage change things can;


the wisdom know difference.




In particular, tell people protect forget pretending predict happen. US keeps beating record. can't imagine what's ending gonna like NYC seen increase cases protestors. 2.5 3 weeks already.

That's like someone surviving mass shooting saying, 'well, people say guns dangerous, people say they're okay handled sensibly, say right, I'm fence one?' ##Masks4All LMAO, hope NJ state trooper arrest toss state prison. Corruption budget cuts. Trump symptom cause. models shown ability predict impact things like mask wearing lockdown changes. They're projecting current trends assumption things function similarly. ""Stand Ground"" would stop quickly.

unfortunately think Venn ""Stand Ground + wears mask"" less overlap one ""Stand Ground + tears others' masks"". call hunch Keep closed vaccine available. run pension funds, want US pay fewer “handouts” poor elderly. believe eugenics think great way weed weak. know virus hits blacks, latinx.and minorities harder, think good thing. want keep making money citizens producing wealth spending capture wealth even endangers kills citizens, since easily replace them.

Those people. need stupid people densely populated area cause problems. people even calling ""trump flu"", good people. Lots people saying it. 

#trumpflu  wait northeast rejoins club. Canned jarred foods. Rice, flour. Maybe even bottled water case Note, make 10 times less deadly, probably 2x number confirmed deaths well.

edit: look CDC excess pneumonia deaths Feb. 1 June 1 alone Don’t forget trusty sidekick Dan Patrick! think general point pretty reasonable, say, *don't* think everyone would particularly claim they're interested investigating positions see they're actually correct own. see lot ""man street"" interviews people proudly say know need go investigate position already know correct one. 

So least far particular methodological approach goes, no, think ""no one"" denies following it.

That mean people immune bias unknowingly wrong too, hierarchies ways people act arrive wrong position, far worse others. use tik tok hate Chyna remember? Microscopic tombstone piledriver. x3 100% real. Disney people get *weird*. enjoy parks go every years goddamn diehard fans insane. 520 deaths per million - 5th highest world, still rising highest rate Europe. also live Sweden, go like unrestricted, lack measures killed lot people Swedes can't leave country summer holidays tourists support economy, businesses like own, coming. going countries control situation instead. I’m hoping it’s younger people getting succumbing disease. 

I’m hopefully naive. Meanwhile Texas like ""The coronavirus kills 40 people day. Never anymore."" 

It's pathetic much south lying. Ah.

That'll fix it. yes lets cautious cause next great depression Plenty people don’t luxury showing work due concerns covid, masks help prevent infecting people around far vice-versa. Texas reopened economy, forced huge number retail food service employees back onto front lines. don’t think they’re blame get sick large segment Texas decided take precautions all. everyone option hiding home. governor took away announced Texas would reopen, damn consequences. That’s largely supporters. Right careful; said something similar end long, informational post government funding unspoken reason every state blowing data-dependent plan reopening automod took “purely political.” One sentence paragraphs unbiased information. Sounds like may misread something believe anything chance get deleted. 

Edit: boner inducing downvote incuming. Tesla terrible company, hope people come realize this. 

Elon Musk trying eliminate people's ""right repair"" interrogating anyone calls buy part, even suspect might small fender bender even tree branch damaged something refused accosted. Even buy one used vehicle history omits something, blacklisted (this makes used Tesla highly undesirable worthless).

I recommend prospective Tesla buyer first watch videos YouTube [Rich Particularly Tesla said fine one repaired, inspected ""Certified"" (at cost thousand $ mind you) revoke decision, blacklist remotely disable Tesla's feature made worth reason Certification first place (fast charging home supercharging stations). dishonest lunacy imo fraudulent. state learn late Check state laws. many states choose wait year. havent seen much, dont really spend enough money effort generally people around stopped caring, idk elsewhere going. store didn’t actively try preventing people staying long credit. agree Target probably use always ammunition ever want get rid people though. 

The people ever saw fired “over redcards” also people would call regularly never tasks completed time. Despite state Target would always find multiple reasons letting people go firing Redcards always easy one one actually knew many supposed getting individually, never hit quota lol. Mom Pop popup hospitals ? think saw fucked state budget due apocalyptic unemployment levels shitty system set serve it. This, combined complete disintegration leadership Senate Executive, may proved unsustainable. I'm sure, seen numbers, know said last two months closures caused 25% shortfall state budget.

It's entirely possible shutdown actually unsustainable forced open back early order keep money coming system get people need it.

Like said, know sure. make decision. believe opening early wrong decision, also even know right decision made. I'm arguing semantics.

I'm saying politicizing needs politicians we've elected address them.

When treat like bad word, end here. US Gov used strategy downplay everything keep economy trucking.

Only time, think many people see right BS here. 

But take bait... It’s going make people feel safer cancel plans parties, family gatherings, etc. weekend. mean would they? There’s plenty hospital beds available! Nothing worry about, folks. Yeah, two cities different way population government split up. certainly agree massive amount collaboration promote rollout effective vaccine. Even several groups falsifying data producing something dangerous, dozens layers backup prevent shenanigans. main point work NIH met skepticism other. Confidence product increase NIH part oversight vaccine development production.

Yeah, scientific agency bows trump isn’t much scientific agency anymore, it? :’( ""Healthcare CEOs Texas Medical Center said Thursday press conference letter sent community Wednesday regarding hospital system's ""increasingly stretched"" ICU capacity level ""misinterpreted,"" stressed pandemic eclipsing hospital capabilities care COVID-19-positive patients.""

Misinterpreted key word. mention, incredibly fluid situation - things change hour. somewhat telling sub assumes flip flop positive attitude lie whereas flip flop negative one indisputable truth. anyone supposed manbearpig now!? Musk: “I’m alpha relationship” lot need relax

He also said: “‘People got complacent,’ said Dr Marc Boom, CEO Houston Methodist hospital system, number patients tripled last month. ‘And it’s coming back biting us, quite frankly.’”

He's stating they're prepared handle high capacity people worry end also stating population needs fucking part quit treating disease like nothing. 
You saying ""people need relax"" complacency he's talking hurricane season coming! Oh got see people verbalizing concern ""addicted disaster porn"" really sociopath. Nobody *wants* next Lombardy, clearly people like super it. Get bent. Texas becomes control group - suck Las Vegas Liberturds!!!!

 

Edit: Reference: Wednesday. clear weekly trend entire course pandemic, [more positive tests always come Friday one single week Wednesday even close top day.

Having shoot high *Wednesday* might mean weekend going see another record high number new cases. There's reason regulations.  theory wrong. never see cops masks. Might look cool combined thier mirror sunglasses. post removed cannot verify reliable source. Twitter sources may reliable. possible, please re-submit link reliable source (i.e. news article).

Me? see neither working human nature. So, rather shut save lives, rather stay open, lots people die people elect shut down?

Genius thinking right there! EMT family member? EMT?

I mean, i'm sure family member go (whose parents dying) told bad idea invited declined. right. leaders can't agree wearing surgical masks prevents spread germs.

No, purpose. want cause much harm death possible. look evidence far. Mind taking screencaps us FB account still want laugh? population NYC much dense Florida, 10x dense Florida's populous city. also much larger hub domestic international travel JFK LGA miles apart.

And leadership FULLY aware factors, still chose tell people go eat enjoy Florida anything, leaders unwilling even require people wear masks.

You absolutely clueless. FL shut large gatherings early March, counties high populations densities locked months. Restaurants operating heavy restrictions, there's movie theaters open, parks beaches closed months, well hotels Air B&amp;Bs anyone essential travelers. governor also took control situation nursing homes, biggest reason death toll FL ten times less NY sending positive patients back homes infect rest York heroic job face incredible challenges.

That's complete horseshit. They're epicenter entire damn country, responsible 20% total deaths US. screwed completely takes damn fool claim almost nothing ample warning precedent (including opening amusement parks soon hosting national convention). going tragedy.

People screaming FL going look like NY since thing started, matter wrong are, still STFU. pointed differences FL NY make rate spread completely different. mental gymnastics utterly laughable. Agreed.

But, know, 99% time coach takes blame players good reason. Americans ""will die "" massive coronavirus surge. Even someone little left center can't say something like Huffpost MSNBC unbiased. conservative decency say Fox. think that's point. mom acting extremely paranoid lately, I've never seen crazy before. talking deleting Facebook account nobody use ""cancel"" her.

I'm bit worried, deleting Facebook might actually good mental health. friend working hospital Galveston, TX. UTMB full lol, ok snowflake ❄️ different way think folks using PPE distant properly good portion get removed infected population side herd immunity. requires use herd immunity certainly lower threshold. confusing people approving Newsome's handling want asked reopening. same.

I can't believe repeat this, completely ignored it. Arkansas here. sent email Gov's office back April telling response improve issue mandatory shut down, he'd hook lives lost.

No chance something like actually getting enforced though. can't see Trump's little buttboy Hutchinson getting taken Hague time soon. Nope. It’s excuse. company tries contact employees come back work can’t get ahold don’t show up, going let go. Typically it’s stated don’t report work without contact 3 day, considered “3 day call show” take voluntary termination.

I’m sure else understand. even got jobs back finally contacted HR.

I think confused nature time off. wasn’t indefinite time off. Manufacturing slow extra employees, gave option take time without pay prevent lay people off. production picked back need people again, return work.

Which comments think absurd constitute self-induced panic? Literally second paragraph link: 


"" [The Public Policy Institute California released Wednesday night also found 69% likely voters state approved Gov. Gavin Newsom’s handling coronavirus crisis, 65% gave high marks overall job he’s governor. "" 


That contradicts assertion voters California behind he's doing. Except Pikachu probably could've handled pandemic far better guys matter - even whole remaining base still votes numbers. People keep pointing 2016 example unreliability polls w/out ever mentioning historical outlier still within margin error. 

While true exactly wrong time overconfident Bid%n victory fact Hill%ry get type advantage polls Agolf point time. least forget, popular vote 3 million votes despite 20-year record low turnout.

And? Aerial transmission won’t stopped that. effective measure seemed like stopping mass events. Something also countries got control common. nothing admitting mistakes. states like FL flat caring American citizens certain parts country willfully ignorant/refusing wear masks. Yep he’s royal c*nt Yeah, like said:

What fuckin' thinking? I’m nurse husband emergency room doctor. truly believe immunizations vaccines. I’m pro vax. I’m trying little realistic someone said wait children vaccine whole country isn’t retarded... certain areas. hard-hit rich countries, 60% deaths disease among people aged 80 over. America, however, exception. Data released June 16th Centres Disease Control (CDC) show country’s death toll skews significantly younger. There, people 80s account less half covid-19 deaths; people 40s, 50s 60s, meanwhile, account significantly larger share die. median covid-19 sufferer America 48-year-old; Italy America outlier? Part explanation surely lies fact America younger population Europe does. America’s median age 38; Italy’s 45. Another reason, perhaps, middle-aged Americans may less healthy European peers, eg, tend obese. exception health reasons. Stop spreading misinformation. feel bad relatives even go, like grandpa. deserve this. unfortunate others acted foolishly pay.. He’s always acted like sales bro. can’t stand him.
When first heard pushed release first Tesla, roadster, even though knew mechanical issues caused cars « completely unsafe » &lt;- words.

Anyone would launch ‘completely unsafe’ car public monster. respect time heard lost. Exactly, plus regions flattened decreased curve good numbers (NYC region), watching places like FL TX AZ shaking heads. Cannot generalize. Scientists working hard this. Maybe available 1-2 years. Everything read said almost one packed crowd rally AZ megachurch wearing masks. think pretty interesting one weird way. vast majority people never know like kill another person. experience lot people going get experience. socializing close quarters without mask, confident killed someone. Let us know feels. ORGANIZE. wont people know bollocks are? Influenza virus mutates faster nucleotide mumbo jumbo. ooooh good point surprised problem. shared shitter lid would awful (tho honey bucket means flushing, would better? dunno could done ""solve"" problem turns way spread. This. Inviting grandparents safe right certainly worth it. Masks come matter cake, etc. can’t believe people read article still throw family parties. Even they’re small ones, that’s takes infect everyone. people read articles like still think they’re immune? I’m trying judgmental don’t understand it. 

FYI missed milestones big family birth pandemic. sucks it, realize you’re missing much. still regret missing things knowing family safer it. point enjoy family life together again, time. that’s ok. many viruses trigger type 1 diabetes. kids suddenly get well 30 year old adults. Get cold, immune system thinks pancreatic cells look mighty similar, destroys insulin producing cells, type 1 diabetes. surprise all. 

Type 2 diabetes I'm little skeptical. organ damage micro clots thing maybe? Steroids causes increase blood sugar people normally receiving insulin might getting hospital. many people might pre diabetic illness exacerbate it. 

So none surprises me. people flippant disease.  Abstract

We correlate county-level COVID-19 death rates key variables using linear regression negative binomial mixed models, although focus linear regression models. include four sets variables: socio-economic variables, county-level health variables, modes commuting, climate pollution patterns. analysis studies daily death rates April 4, 2020 May 27, 2020. estimate correlation patterns across states, well within states. models, find higher shares African American residents county correlated higher death rates. However, restrict correlation patterns within given state, statistical significance correlation death rates share African Americans, remaining positive, wanes. find similar results share elderly county. find higher amounts commuting via public transportation, relative telecommuting, correlated higher death rates. correlation driving work, relative telecommuting, death rates also positive across models, statistically significant look across states counties. also find higher share people working, thus commuting either elderly, children unemployed, correlated higher death rates. Counties higher home values, higher summer temperatures, lower winter temperatures higher death rates. Contrary past work, find correlation pollution death rates. Also importantly, find death rates correlated obesity rates, ICU beds per capita, poverty rates. Finally, model looks within states yields estimates given state's death rate compares states controlling variables included model; may interpreted measure states relative others. find death rates Northeast substantially higher compared states, even control four sets variables above. Death rates also statistically significantly higher Michigan, Louisiana, Iowa, Indiana, Colorado. California's death rate lowest across states. Actually like 5,000 active cases (down like 50K May). 100ish new cases per day maybe

I live Mass too, dunno I'd kind indoor get-together (even masks), distancing outdoors sure (even without masks) trying fool? said said. You’re one acting like fool. Stay lane. protested like mad NY, don’t spikes. always lie administration. 

It spreading fast places like Australia, hot. Tbh sounds lit. Yeah, there's way would want baby now. Fortunately, mine September. already back work 2 months time told us stay home. bad baby need socialize go school. gets around every day! Well went niche market mass market. One would expect scale would challenging maintain quality.

...also Musk worthy hero worship candidate. still fail understand people's need that. Steve Jobs also great person happened lead well staffed corporation. doomers said ""this shit's gonna get control"" re-open imply spreading linear rate? Trump blame protests. Especially since media lefties medical people explained protests noble cause contact tracers aren’t asking tracking protesters. beach, bars political rallies .....bad! Well....SURPRISE! people getting early... doesn’t worry stories unless someone works Fox News goes rogue. One hopes among many issues pandemic shining flashlight on, need unions US stronger ever. [My cousin... quite literally you’re fooling one pretending otherwise. Always wondered isnt complete 6 week lockdown civilized world...we counted chickens right lot people around country think that. know. 1 500 1 200 americans die, almost every American know someone (our social network science average 300 people) died it'll late then. President told to? ...it's joke Pres. past said Mexican immigrants. Mass homelessness top massive unemployment civil unrest sure interesting combination first thing reality dawned early February (uk here) look life cycles coronaviruses general. 28+ days inactive types surface 10° high humidity (like UK winter) like 12 hours 25° heat. thinking lot people touch something 12 hours. Heat gonna stop this. Wear homemade mask try spit. 


Wear surgical mask try spit. 


Wear N95 mask try spit. feel like would seen itching PICC line now. Yeah, irritated people covering protests while, without really bringing risks spread it. Freedom? free many European nations managed become pandemic dumpster fire. Americans put we've propaganda beaten heads since birth along recent rise anti-science culture. I’m doing? Hm. Interesting. Tell me, knight.... ...it's joke Pres. past said Mexican immigrants. agree it’s right thing do. I’m curious see homeschooling numbers look like nationwide next year. spoken parents plan thing? Also, don’t mind asking - generally rural/suburban/urban district state COVID relative states? Yeah, see population-adjusted death rate flu epidemics went down? That's antivirals flu even 20 years ago.

The fact COVID killing many given modern medicine absolutely insane. think people realize hitting 1918 death rates mean unprecedented. One hope. I'm still seeing trump flags people's yards asshole boss still planning 4 years ago taking whole family rallies pump fists scream name. 

We're kitchen, sent text 2 weeks ago telling us dont wear masks uncomfortable hot kitchen risk. Someone family member getting tested yesterday, got text saying wear masks results ready dont wear mask 11 1 5 7 super busy might pass heat. Wtf! corona gonna say hey...its 7PM can't infect girl. 

The newest bit bullshit I'm hearing around town nobody died corona. deaths normal deaths counting virus deaths Gov't gets $ China...because china going reimburse us death?...lol. walked away heard one. CFR IFR?

and relevant data age group. Overall almost irrelevant 80+ old person 1000 times likely die 20 yr old. ""We go quietly night, vanish without fight!"" I’m surprised respect left lose. Americans demonstrably poor job complying regulation much less guidelines recommendations. need regulation teeth. need police (despite defunding initiatives) enforce regulations. Tickets actual fines. Nose exposed? Ticket. Mask around neck? Ticket. close line outside business (or inside)? Ticket. Oh, that’s sad. I’m surprised people still holding large weddings, suppose businesses opening may difficult cancel edit names political parties. It’s annoying.

Surely *this* pattern wont happen States.  Writing audience Texans, sort makes sense. still insane even suggest, even arguably *dangerous* spoken health official/provider. "" Zero deaths luck"". must read Patient 91, British pilot then. well. daily new cases still rise neighbouring countries well peak, Norway Finland single digits new cases daily Sweden around 1000. Deaths around 20-30 per day Sweden Vs 1 Norway. Gotta thank everyone behind recent riots. Ohhhh bro def wear mask guy , I’m fighting friend right social media it. Tried showing diagram reddit explaining masks using peeing someone pants vs pants , it’s pretty simple first grade shit still don’t get lol.

People don’t wear masks fucking imbeciles.

Just kind people either giving look anxiety going crazy gotta fucking cough public like normally do, ran grocery store day , could feel coming. It’s shitty feeling . average age infected people fell, death rate fall well. I'm looking country(Czech Republic) official numbers one death age group (25-34) 1553 cases(woman preexisting conditions). deaths &lt;25 y.o (1651 cases). gives us \~0.06% CFR 25-34 sweet 0% young folks :). Sounds like teenager trying explain fault wrapped dad's station wagon around tree square earth 6 sides. Maybe still best course action nation. America needs unified approach controlling pandemic. done states since feds Fauci lunch. Schools designed distancing. area normal class size 30 they'd able safely teach 5-6 time maximum 1 day school. dont like wearing mask either. additional expense whether disposable not, uncomfortable, dangerous prolonged period. Ideally line work set work home, probably better safer. That's stupid overstated analogy. Masks likely worn cautious, cautious also likely make sure stay 6 feet away, congregate large groups go near sustainable serious disease. MASKS help, caution masks wearers already practice? doubt even Scandinavian. made claims Scandinavian countries (not merely Sweden) really off-kilter well. Yes. I’m Italy you’re correct. Italians behaving pre-pandemic. Although say mostly wearing masks. businesses successfully adapted operations cautious others aren’t. don’t even go bar coffee I’m sure it. It’s strange weirdly older vulnerable ones quite blasé. I’m disappointed isn’t nearly bad people (Karen’s) behaving USA. Best wishes Italian cousins! genuinely fear everyone. Btw think Berlusconi’s private doctor declared virus weakened. Wait n see jam packed Italian beaches get come July August. Terrified! Ok serious crime then. right drugs don’t count. shirts shoes service?

All questions tough stupid. Americans know freedom is, buzzword like toss around we've run excuses clownish stupidity  still way anytime ""good news"" tag used. ""Only matter time doomers come explain blind optimism random science reporter's interpretation super preliminary press release study almost completely unfounded"". 

I get annoyed blind pessimism too, looking think anywhere close ""end"" coronavirus (if one new seasonal flu hits us over), need healthy dose reality. believe misreading that.

Senator /u/jeffjacksonnc -- wearing masks health reasons felony August 1?  sounds fun 3 months panic attacks causing shortness breath. acquired power rack weights canceled gym even though open TX month now. Investment life, saves much time too. mention cutting risk. America first again! Damm look America go :D current administration thinks anyone wearing mask dislike them, turn made wearing masks ""unpatriotic"".

I get hopes research funding Dr. Hotez. talking Desktop traffic, mobile users. November long way away. January 20 even longer Radio People U.S. still know masks necessary due massive failure leadership. Everyone could made masks 15 minutes simple instructions government. Instead got ""masks work"" months. impressed passing malaria. good thing purpose pump stocks nothing else. TL;DR: Sweden's unethical damaging [herd immunity harming tourism industry Gotland. parents also work 2 days week? kminder 2 weeks

I feel it’s matter time finds consequences holding rallies. whole view Covid change he, Ivanka, Trump Jr., Melania, Bruce Wayne Trump get hard time trying fight it? Would finally say, “You know what, maybe wearing masks!” starts line TRUMP INC. masks MAGA masks? Would supporters fall line criticize people don’t wear masks? Would go far make executive order people don’t wear masks get sent jail 10 years prison (like latest stunt statues)?

I feel something huge change moment happens. “Everybody’s gangsta happens them” pretty much slogan anti-mask people. reopeners, pastors, governors, etc. rude awakening get positive test truly see it’s like flu not. True, majority positive cases turn mild, there’s always chance turn south real quick. agenda provide data transparently? Arguing number feet silly. There's average distribution viral particles function distance person. distribution drops off, threshold (which zero), say distance safe distance people.

Different threshold values give different distances. 6 feet advantage least somewhat practical permitting society function (i.e. allowing grocery shopping without 300 ft long lines, outdoor exercise)

Things like ventilation actually important, poorly ventilated areas, aerosols stay suspended long time. situations one person walks another person's aerosols, even always maintaining large separation.

The safest thing always avoid public places, in-person interaction others, much possible. think teachers need hazard pay. student starts coughing, can’t leave room. can’t tell many 1st graders sneezed right face talking them. 1300 elementary school students building.

Now island's entrepreneurs politicians appealing help fall avoid mass bankruptcies widespread unemployment.

- moments blackest, think lot Gotland looks like 2021, says politician week Mia Stuhre.

Three months ago, Public Health Authority tightened restrictions countering spread covid-19. day after, Almedals week canceled. Tourists slowly begun return - take time repair damage.

In local media, entrepreneurs described message ""killing blow"" ""utterly devastating"". 

- came shock many, says project manager Mia Stuhre Almedals Week.

In one day, companies lost 70 percent annual income.

- worried hit companies cannot find new markets Gotland restrictions comes local neighbors. mean next year, use Visby Almedals week? companies hotels left?


Mia Stuhre emphasizes Almedals week canceled postponed next year. money many depend gone. Dagens Industri estimated 2017 week sales SEK 250 million. decision affects whole society.


- residents way involved hospitality industry serve ensure Gotland lives visitors. clear see breakdown. heavy, says Frida Boklund, Entrepreneur's regional manager Gotland.


Spring tough: Easter tourism almost completely absent, events canceled tourists closed out. decision screen island made taking account strained health care adapted 60,000 inhabitants overloaded hundreds thousands tourists arrive.


Mia Stuhre still says crisis welded inhabitants. hope. time constant concern future.


Open visitors not? issue characterized island spring.


Victoria Berge running Kalk Hotel four years 21 rooms across street Almedalen speaking scene.


- season usually is, feels like sky-long low season, says.


In March, everything stopped, says. 

- stopped comparing previous year disappointed. May September, usually full occupancy every day. gone 100 percent occupancy 18-24 percent spring.


Of course, put corporate hat, want Gotland closed down, dependent tourism. exist unless tourists exist. 


Some entrepreneurs critical tourists summer guests advised visit Gotland, residents wanted isolate island stop ferry. 


Victoria Berge split. Life health go first, says - hotel owner needs guests. Gotland welcome visitors, help needed outside, example, care needs resources.


- Help us equip ourselves. course, put corporate hat, want Gotland closed down, dependent tourism. exist unless tourists exist. divided. think important save lives, also want save business. opportunity like maybe rest Sweden kick start fall, not.


Gotland's hospitality industry annual sales around SEK 4 billion, much agriculture food production combined. Tourism important engine contributes ""maintaining service vibrant countryside"", municipality's outline plan states.


It important future, says regional director Peter Lindvall.


- restrictions removed mitigated, together industry make proper collection power come back .


Will manage recovery without government support?


- No, without state support.


During corona crisis, Gotland's vulnerabilities become particularly clear, especially three sectors: transport island, healthcare electricity grid. ""Extremely important"" usually, even now.

- extremely strenuous pandemic know long-term connection air, often ferries go, know stable electricity supply Gotland.

If lasts long time, hit hard place like Gotland. 

The specialization tourism makes places like Gotland extra vulnerable crises nothing else, industry, fall back on. That's Charlotta Mellander, professor economics Jönköping University, says. 


How Gotland get crisis?

It unusually quiet summer country Kneipp village kilometers south Visby, opening postponed. spring, management tried gas slow crisis time plans constantly bursting. 

- situation shabby, otherwise good, says CEO Bobbo Werkelin. 


Usually around 100,000 people visit facility - year plan much lower figure. Spring characterized uncertainty.


- used making solutions quick decisions, possible. Everyone missed pandemic lesson equally taken everywhere.


We summer destination, companies get big revenue May September. support hit right way. 


The hospitality industry provides 2,500 full-time jobs Gotland. normal high season, 6,000 people expected work tourism form. year, entrepreneurs waiting hire summer job seekers situation uncertain. normal summer, 200 young people worked Kneipp village.

- summer destination, companies get big revenue May September. support hit right way, says Eva Nypelius (C), chair regional board.


According Sweden's municipalities regions (SKR) latest forecast, Gotland's tax revenue estimated decrease 156 million. Government grants smooth loss, means less money welfare. forecast also based positive autumn. Nypelius ""very worried"" loss grow.


In June , government eased restrictions travel within Sweden. long-awaited, positive message, says Nypelius. situation remains serious. different summer concerns autumn remain.

- see many companies hospitality industry severely affected. reliefs mean may see bankruptcies threatened, different companies, lost large part revenue. followed up, important analyze continue work close business see develops. Good job Vietnam! like drinking. dare yu shut bars Z hurts most... like.. we've already made necessary choice suffer lockdown, let's toss progress window. think root issue average joe government offered terrible financial support. way sustain smart quarantine we're gonna help folks financially. Taiwan wonder think transitioning home schooling always option everyone. capable home schooling work making transition. Many capable home schooling due work requirements. Anyone know massive dust cloud happened year it’s curse 2020? First that's one specific industry. 

But even there, proves point. read methodology? ranking proportion size economy. relative smaller size, Switzerland Sweden lot innovating. Good them. But, much appropriate comparison would break US component states, way Europe broken component states. done that, list would read California, New York, Massachusetts, Washington, Texas, Florida, Switzerland, Sweden, something effect. definitely Americans stupid. Almost everyone refuses wear masks Sweden. Heck, even social norm wear one get stares kids shouting ""CORONA! CORONA!"" designed US, ran US US residents predominant users. Thus mostly talk US Rational people realized can't shut entire economy able function country .especially country like America many people dependent government. may work mother Wow! nice surprise! suspect beginning last week March (kids dad working essential time without much precaution) denied tests wont know sure, even got tested anti bodies theyve likely died since suspect 2-3 months them. COVID-19: ""SURPRISE!!!"" FTBA?! Ignorance costs. Ask afford it, acting stupid like silly Americans. Oh no. I’m picturing Trump telling everyone wipe ass rally. really powerful ass. Pure online, requires parent home supervise hope learning. understand see possible country transitioned two working parents dependence child care. Remember evidence person person spread animals could reservoir? Human transmission obvious point, cull minks Netherlands due humans catching virus them.

It stands reason say ""There evidence \_\_\_\_\_\_"". looks like possibility, safe know sure cannot vector. Here's hoping hit hard get better quick comments diving deeper deeper conspiracy territory. probably Illuminati along! use per capita helps narrative pushing.

Deaths...total number

Cases...total number

Tests....per capita US likely already close 180,000 coronavirus victims March 15 May 16 18,600 missing deaths US. likely thousands since then. think missed article highlighting 1) potentially *largest* 50 years 2) effects heightened due already stretched resources medical capacity seems like may middle path people f’ing masks.  children age 5 died COVID-19 Alabama, according data provided Alabama Department Public Health.   weeks ago, first death child age range reported officials.   
  say child underlying medical condition, we’re told child suffer Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome-Children (MIS-C), rare condition children linked coronavirus.    
  
Rest peace little one hard breathe right, edit comment. Insane. Indoors? lot people think want tests? go there! r/leopardsatemyface 700/day *now!* cases doubling quickly, math problem like first time. Understand exponential growth! doubles twice that's 9/11 every day! numbers April hard lock down! places dgaf still attending packed bars wear masks!

Contrary people think, still really good medicine thing. New therapies critically ill patients prevent death 20% time that's would call cure even great outcome. way think try manipulate people putting heads back sand bringing old sawhorse ""fayk news"" ""no not"" ""remember one time said two weeks instead five, completely discredits you,"" that.

I never said two weeks throw part anti lockdown troll brigade tactic.

The media lies sensationalist fake Wuhan hospital built 8 days. fake mass graves Iran seen satellite. fake crying Italian doctors. fake mass graves Brazil bodies streets Ecuador. things saw eyes, fayk news not. kindergartener put two two together ask there's difference people Americans. answer obviously no. 10, 000 people open area sunlight wearing masks vs people indoors close proximity without masks....hmmmm need pointed surge started rise protests ever started? Unions issues, much better power all. think important remember ""many"" still minority. [Twice many Americans approve labor unions lack organization openness idea that's screwing us. requires 85% population infected within timeframe immunity- scientists even certain of. plan wouldnt work many people unwilling allow get infected protect accordingly. Gotta steal people's money somehow. sure 100% accurate. workers rely sick/vacation time. government compensates then. 
If USA sick/vacation time get nada Except death rates.wonder big immune systems feel like it’s busy people going normal I’m at. It’s like everyone celebrating things opening. problem lot us fact red hats terrified, held hostage CHUDs suburbs. know improve Swedish image: apologize rouge state pursuing anti-scientific unethical herd immunity policy, institute stricter NPIs order get spread down, shift Test, Trace, Isolate strategy. 

Sadly, one three things likely happen. Let's hope enough since Sweden's herd immunity strategy harmful every way, least tourism based industry like cruise lines. odd reason one wants visit place has, relatively speaking, incredibly high burden infection. also regular people jobs... Doctors scientists aren’t charge.

Dumb bricks politicians Let's get excited leadership here. Easy say wear masks numbers spike, would prevented spike? Always reacting, classic Scott link literally says America fattest nation lmao. necessarily disagreeing sentiment, but, think person agenda well, objective.  Relax, brand political speech allowed. rules squash team Jesus people sound like ROOTING people die. 0% chance 600,000 lmao mainly showdown collective responsibility individualism around world. societies capable collective decisions responsibility shown ability handle pandemic. 

The individualist societies maximizing personal freedom not. US demarcation line seems roughly exist Dems GOP. are, masks seem one effective help contain spread. We'll really see efficacy masks protests trump rally numbers come pouring in. far seems like protests, looked lile people wore masks, causing significant spike, far. Trump rally numbers come week so. 


And mean US, Id like number N95 mask plug cant find I'm at. followed much Frederick Montgomery Counties MD? go store either two counties everybody wearing mask. Whereas Leesburg Ashburn, maybe 50% people wearing masks about. MD actually enforce something? “Surprise Motherfucker”

-COVID-19 Perhaps case test results may coming sporadically necessitating filtering data 7 day period? ...did guys read article? Doesn’t read like guys did.

Elon said could work home bunch folks decided take unpaid leave. There’s obviously disconnect there. 

If took unpaid leave, would fired too. lot people would right now... Fuckity fuck fucking fucker! Unfortunately, type protect inhaling particulate. even ‘murica ... could compare notes?? /s become zombie victim homicide turn kill people? Oh sure prevent viruses spread far, expense whole “don’t touch face” thing whole “practice good hand hygiene” thing, transferring viruses inside mask putting directly nose mouth. Home births safe professionals. Ontario highly enducated regulated midwifery profession fully integrated health care system. home birth outcomes show better result hospital births equally safe. thought paying $10-50 per paycheck something rarely use seems like waste people. 

I’ve worked couple union jobs. ever encourage register vote. would done regardless. 

I recognize unions benefitted millions workers. experience don’t rate highly uncle died covid19 back April. hold funeral back then, we'll July 4. really want go. think big risk, especially it'll take place extremely touristic town borders opened again, cases start rising soon. everybody wearing masks. think it. 

My cousins also want organize family get-together 20+ people mid-July. food drinks, masks. nobody gets sick, it'll sheer luck, risk huge. Definitely attending one myself. Stop lying .is china paying per post per word spread fear mongering shit. Archive link: border Sweden Finland remains closed while, Finland's Foreign Minister Pekka Haavisto announced Tuesday. means yet another tough blow cruise companies, want government work harder Swedish image.

- say? course, unfortunate many, least industry,”says Tallink Silja's communications manager Erika Janson message came Tuesday, Finnish foreign minister practice put stop company's regular operations.

""This peak season, hope solution soon possible,"" says Eleonora Hansi, Viking Line Scandinavia's information manager.

At beginning pandemic, Viking Line lost 98 percent revenue. Virtually staff laid half country employees Sweden notified. 

Now companies forced adapt operations new order. Among things, operate freight Sweden Finland summer start cruises Stockholm Visby. Despite this, companies hope open border soon.

- constantly waiting another message come. huge number customers every day ask us open line Helsinki. Finland says constantly reviewing situation possibility releasing restrictions Sweden, hoped case, says Erika Janson. 

She wants call government make efforts Swedish image. 

- **Of course, mainly curbing spread infection, also diplomacy. bit ironic Sweden's desire continue open society led us become isolated society**, says Erika Janson continues:

- priority government make sure change Sweden image damage business especially hospitality industry becomes great.

- hope, course, like everyone world, relieved soon possible. relationship Sweden Finland important, says Eleonora Hansi.  sad scary :(. Im person family seems way concerned virus. 
Whats worse intermingle, go cookouts/ parties/ etc. dont show actually care. Makes feel left out, also conflicted may well lose one virus anyway despite part potentially spread them. Whats worse dad wife involved takes care grandma aunt (that raised me) one done battle cancer morbidly obese diabetes 60.

What lose without seeing last months family members want stupid? agree. This. True change come everyone lost loved one. BIPOC getting disproportionately slammed. Think it, they’re likely working essential jobs, use public transportation, less access health care... I’ve told eat cake we’re hungry, too! ""mistakes"" intentional calculated moves Media: “*GASP!* Data suggests could TEN TIMES cases U.S. official
numbers show!”

How guys always 3 months behind established data? Press coverage pandemic complete joke. 2 weeks ago coronavirus new case rate \~17k day.

Today new case rate around 40k day. Well worst day April.

This around exponential growth 1.06.

At rate could 225,000+ new cases DAY end July. 

This well past capacity health system cope mortality rates going start rising well.

So, 'live with' quarter million new cases day maybe many 10,000 dead day higher?

Really? deal it? thanks making point.
Also, Im going assume english first language. Ill let slide. saying enrolled districts e-academy makes sound like separate program haven’t given details yet. Parents supposed get phone call July give info allow pick online vs classroom. Lol want do? Best get resume togetherx begin networking apply jobs. real world bud cant bust corporate office demand job back. Get real comment next time still sub? Less .5% lethality. 

Masks aren’t N-95 don’t work get N-95 mask run risks getting carbon dioxide poisoning least headache. Plus aren’t switching out, you’re putting dirty mask. You’re better wearing mask. It’s meant sick people. one day one. good marketing dept tho Meijer. deny climate change data. said absolute proof anything. There's never absolute proof anything. 

Your dealing deaths here. game. also, beds likely non-ICU sub-ICU, ventilation systems. want dude appendicitis next someone coughing vast amounts contagions - even next room shared duct. brain is like large super computer control not health also life reality experience

OK, objective, external reality, minds, us power control reality, us actually exist anyway, figments Lenka's imagination? Neo, sees matrix, cured incurable disease probably also immortal. right wing lunatic. Learn empathy. Kind dick move... Edit: misread. Two many people? still living bleeding hearts first duty government protect lives citizens. administration blood citizens hands, reckless inaction stop spread coronavirus. Plus, plans postpone reopening Disney couple weeks.

Smh. I’m you. work TMC hospital myself. Take care please. may seem like you’re alone but, promise, you’re not. True false: Elon Musk tried sell blood emeralds Tiffanys NYC. slammed head door maybe I'm sure I'm getting right, antibodies tests show 0.5-1.3% IFR test antibodies right? cells? Could actual IFR much lower considering lot people antibodies cell response thus they're counted towards IFR? Unfortunately Texas filled people say, “BuT mUh FrEeDuMs” Q1 barely affected, especially since remained open violation shelter place orders last week quarter. you’ll need change anon;  uniformed all. It’s called big brain. don’t have. Think people!

But also fix margarita burger want steak! Waiter, waiter! Trump going away

To jail

In months full shit point confirmed cases doubling, Asia things considered almost none, Africa well, EU 30% people 10% daily cases.

Full shit meekly accepting ""**hot spots**"" means **major cities**!! agree. would still make point include everything see Covid rising. would need reach top growth show. shutdown Wuhan China whole. UTMB part TMC. rushing open beds hospitals. also taken patients nearby Houston hospitals. tell this, several coworkers past weeks don’t even wear masks correctly, all. work hospital yet think it’s over. Stop trying make us fear kungflu [Why think hot takes truth is, nothing worrisome whatsoever going Arizona Texas beyond fact coronavirus started inexorable spread interior states later East Left coasts, therefore cresting slightly later, June 8, count infected cases Covid deaths Arizona stood 27,678 1,047, respectively. figures hot spot make, offer reason getting state’s boot-heel economy ASAP.


And fact, first 8 days June, Arizona reported 7,742 new cases – figure sharply higher 2,189 new cases reported last eight days April, gain entirely function testing rate some. Thus, June 1 June 8 span, state reported 62,825 new tests, implying infection rate contrast, April 22 April 30 state reported 15,185 new tests (one-fourth June figure), implying infection rate state testing lot more, instructed Washington, accelerated testing **generating falling infection rate!**

[Is going mean wouldn’t really call less half percent error checks sent hundred+ million ppl short notice failure. Would rather waited another 6 months make sure dead people didn’t get checks ? that’s well good regular people like i, again, trump cabinet claim citizen, therefore law due status. it’s ridiculous.

Depending order magnitude, duplicates might significant though. like 200 new cases reported there's 100, that's one thing, reporting 20,000 there's 10,000 would definitely cause concern. looked dashboard, yes, current numbers really impressive. wish CA squandered lead given. honestly think need bring back sports let set example following guidelines, like wearing masks. feel like it’s one things deniers actually respond to.

Require masks football stadiums, space crowds apart, show people sports teams taking things seriously. Kick people don’t follow rules, flat exclude teams seasons states guidelines lax.

Seriously, sports may way get idiots. think one going away months I'd still support cause proves tells like /s  Interesting. Many doctor’s office even house X-ray machine. didn’t pause anything.

Götterdämmerung definition - collapse (as society regime) marked catastrophic violence disorder; broadly : downfall.

Wow. like it. Wagnerian! think NY fucked up. whole new level gotta roll R .. hate Again, gives fuck cumulative deaths... nursing home otherwise.

Wow UK fairly well Well also still elective surgeries governor banned. also free lot icu beds. FREE FISH! Houston covid patients making 25% That's thing this, crisis already locked now. people soon flood system already presymtomatic early stage symptoms soon become much worse. disappointed? population that's getting sick generally healthier 1 1.5 weeks new phase growth. likely deaths begin increase substantially next 2 weeks especially Healthcare systems strained (again). last two days reported NYT lower 2 weeks ago higher previous week, indicating may reached inflection point deaths. could also statistical noise IMO case trend line going exponential starting see deaths tick real. mouth? would hate see evening news infecting family. ""History repeat, sure hell rhymes."" Many factors play really. Even though cure, doctors nurses experience treating patients likely saving lives able months ago. drugs slight impact terms saving lives well.

Another big factor much deaths early US coming NYC area hospital system overwhelmed, like saw northern italy. That's see deaths. virus rampant country spread across nation one small geographical area handle hospitalizations. Wow, last get (virtually) meet leadership Bohemian Club. subreddit, taking pulse proletariat? exactly people need stay home. It’s reduce routinely expected incidents... Cross-reactive cells, much profound part immune system antibodies. example, cells catalyst antibody production.

Does necessarily mean immunity, rather exemplifies immune system capable fighting virus successfully. Indeed, mild symptoms, bigger chance immune response successful fighting virus without producing antibodies. 

You've probably read somewhere, someone wrote 'I mild cough/fever/etc negative antibody test'. common. opposed 'I worst flu life tested positive antibodies.' Nothing good things, predict.
Too many damned mfs world. Wtf this? already got notice March? Like already know. Expect virus go till next year. underestimate many idiots Texas still believe democratic hoax masks way branded devil.

""They always enough capacity, people hospital already pre-existing conditions. whole thing hoax."" - C2HShadowban ""sustained surge capacity"" talking article expected run 12 days. saying ""100%"" capacity right 'misleading'. hook first. It’s time Texas, Houston particular take steps become like NYC hospital, double number ICU beds, put beds hallways, double patients O2 lines horrors. Now? Now!? Smh They've already started that. Someone facebook feed posted meme day denigrating Barack, Michelle, Bill Hillary -- anything anything year 2020. matches invented. do.

Pick disease. You’re delusional think anyone sees light blue surgical masks threatening. Living lockdown months definitely made reconsider 3 already have. (that's joke btw. Mostly.) last virus, know brutal virus be, look 14th century Bubonic Plague, thats ""benchmark"". aint so, though. painfully obvious masks worked. Japan barely anything, everyone wears masks they're shitfuck retarded.  Amazing mass protests nothing number, businesses opening grocery stores masses shoppers running full steam whole time. Yeah...R0 still figured even universal case case. Biology diverse. I'm sure trying say. Damn. state this? worry, people ""believe"" this, inevitable stock market crash (again) economic implosion going rock everyone reality *really* fucking hard. refrigerated trucks streets NYC mostly didn’t fill. 

They plumes thick smoke belching crematoriums four months. could see weather maps. media may say wasn’t bad, there’s magic-waving corpse fires away. say ok bailouts big companies. Let fail. Americans hate wearing masks?

[March 26th: SEATTLE – forecast based new data analyses, researchers find](http://www.healthdata.org/news-release/new-covid-19-forecasts-us-hospitals-could-be-overwhelmed-second-week-april-demand-icu) demand ventilators beds US hospital intensive care units (ICUs) far exceed capacity COVID-19 patients early second week April. Deaths related current wave COVID-19 US likely persist July, even assuming people protect communities strongly adhering social distancing measures taking precautions advised public health officials. 

“Our estimated trajectory COVID-19 deaths assumes continued uninterrupted vigilance general public, hospital health workers, government agencies,” said Dr. Christopher Murray, Director Institute Health Metrics Evaluation (IHME) University Washington’s School Medicine. “The trajectory pandemic change – dramatically worse – people ease social distancing relax precautions. encourage everyone adhere precautions help save lives.”

IHME’s analysis, based observed death rates, estimates next four months US, approximately 81,000 people die virus. Estimates range 38,000 **162,000** US deaths. CDC publishes information. mobile atm. said gave 1200 4 months expenses. Literally one receive unemployment stimulus would lie. Take unemployment completely equation literally give people money. lot it. questions asked. 

Lol. that’s I’m dealing with. would people still working full time need receive money? blame them, know Quebecers disappointed. years truly know numbers like richest country earth decided easier pretend nothings wrong actually financially support us I’m sick bullshit fear mongering idiots lap up.

Cases increasing literally 3rd important metric behind hospitalization rate deaths per day.

It doesn’t matter many new cases still room patients hospitals. live Portland fucking Oregon buddy got bashed wearing masks last week Tillikum bridge. Fucking wild. 

It’s rocket surgery, people. best number world, like miracle... CHOP. 

They change name realized actual life skills. Germany lets live welfare single able bodied person perpetuity? Yes. Almost people (if all) got infected first wave got released hospital, footage alive thanking doctors tv. ongoing cases people recently came back Vietnam countries get proper treatment. Also, almost every case diagnosed early stages. death rate 5.1% simply countries (not all) 
either enough resources treat every one got virus react soon enough let sickness get worse. case Vietnam. Plus, got pretty lucky. think death rate would really high every country taken virus seriously like us start?

I suggest research way country reacted virus judge yourself. wearing masks like article implied. took every caution possible avoid it. worked. comment age well. includes actual health insurance children doesnt cost $600/month. 6 damn staffers tested positive, he's half hair's width away getting himself

Miracle happened yet me, biggest thing masks protect stop mindlessly touching face. Like many others, never realized often touch face without realizing now. Can't flee Russia arrested leaves White House. 39,101 Well good luck that. half-assed. Scratch that, even quarter-assed.

What needed happen solid 4-6 weeks *hard* lockdown. Life-critical services only, leave home food, emergencies, nothing else. POLLOS late. 


http://magicalpassings.com/ don’t know. maker space town installed bathroom. nice, eyes stung while. I’m sure didn’t permanent damage, wasn’t comfortable day... http://magicalpassings.com/ Soon virus disappear choose locked inside avoid idiots see nothing wrong world today.    Shut People morons. India heatwave last week May temperatures crossed 40 C several states. high temperatures effect virus spread look numbers. Oh nos, oh gods, oh.. well okay. 

So pandemic hospitalization cases (the people tested, generally) almost reached 1% population. group affected 15.2% dying, today, rest recovering. 

Quick panic because.. because.. wait, less 1%.. total population United States. among less 1% 15.2% dying (this number drops daily people recover). Also, United States only.

Maybe panic bit less? recent news report infected hairdresser worked hundred clients, everyone wore masks, none 40 clients got tested positive. that's encouraging. additional precaution, may want inform barber asthma ask minimize speaking haircut, research evidence speaking produce almost much droplets coughing many super-spreader spread events linked excessive talking (i.e. call centers). simple, quick haircut also less risky long one exposure time matters, experts currently consider encounter 15min low risk, probably longer parties masked. Another precaution consider wear mask properly, YouTube videos right, well fitted surgical mask offer much protection non-professionally fitted N95 mask.  We're going ignore spike cases happening weeks mass public marches? Weird figure R0 real time death rate yet. 11.4 million representative 25 million though. seems mostly kill people past prime reproductive ages, natural selection seem play here. Well, let’s add Pope “people lifesaving masks.” Another thing keep mind (not if) COVID maxes ICU capacity, people need non-COVID reasons dying simply beds. Sounds right, maybe bit low actually many children killed? don’t understand logic “open economy” “no masks” protester types. Wearing masks opening economy mutually exclusive. matter fact, go hand hand. *Yet.* cast ballot Romanov hour researching race one red race could voted instead, problem pointing obvious flaw logic?

Yeah, right. reread article. WTF?

Several little communities rural TX county going holiday events. mention parties, BBQs, get togethers private property. community canceled official party leaving picnic pavillion, recreation area lake access gate open residents use.

South Korea, government run people morons, city comparable size/population new york city, handled without hurting economy, without formal lock down.

We richer many advantages South Korea. one worst performing countries whole world. deaths lag quite bit. Two articles. Non scientific. Ya got me. someone worked years healthcare IT, HIPAA hiding absolute bullshit see. People attempting hide behind HIPAA much like constitution comes wearing mask, really neither one relevant conversation enables people gigantic fucking babies trying come across righteous. challenge anyone opposing end argument actually cite constitution HIPAA act like pretend rights violated. sure day it’s similar me. 
I wish weren’t lockdown. thoughtful comments get blocked shit stays. Cause life still good live ignore BS Yes huddo ftba require send money gram us Middle East face jail crime! Would nice public officials, like Surgeon General Dr. Fauci, spend last three months actively dissuading people wearing mask. don’t don’t additional costs. 

I still don’t think understand people evict. It’s pretty simple concept  “I never kid” cost living coastal city much higher. make 125k, 75-80k take taxes, limited 401k, health insurance. 75-80k, need pay 25k-40k rent/mortgage, depending city. also need pay rest bills (groceries, car, utilities, phone, student loans, etc.), higher average live high cost city. need daycare, expect another 20k+ year per kid. include clothing (professional personal), dining out, entertainment, incidentals, etc. are, again, expensive live. Add medical expenses unexpected expenses there's nothing left.

125k goes fast outside midwest south. much lower middle class middle class lifestyle coast. saying people deserve help? Imagine calling Mattis coward. lock affect mom's job. hand, still working 60+ hours week. Still managed pay bills time let mom know we'll ok. rest neighbors lucky. :( Good lord. read decide squint eyes take ridiculous stance.

No, planes go poof, things good lose massive chunk institutional knowledge. say holier thou, terrible spot weeks ago worked correct would say current percentage speaks volumes well people worked ""flatten curve"".

We incredibly susceptible NYC area due people literally living top unravel again, take precaution maintain status. FL TX's spot months ago, know fast things go south (no pun intended) attempt thwart another meltdown, we're simply closing doors weeks.  state closed exceptions Exactly. Look china, know lied deaths things still running behind months opening. FDA good reputation put safety money politics. Hope resist pressure. maybe Texas say “hold cowboy hat”? 0% politicians would want doesn’t matter. shut back “again” applicable remember early March trumpets going Obama ""letting"" 12k die H1N1. quickly dropped one. Oh no, there’s plan support people hospitalized COVID-19, there? give up. America make safe again. reality need worry much vehicle someone. needs sufficient viral load getting inside get party started.

Wash yo hands, touch face!   Jews. fucker talking Jews. really need source thinking you? numbers many people laid many people died. math. week mean, help climate change preventing us able buy plastic. That’s feels like. I’ve quoting stats since beginning people circle still think I’m paranoid. gets worse go Redondo Beach Marina Del Rey Rancho Paulo’s Verdes, people look weird wearing mask. It’s really bizarre situation. 

Meanwhile work Santa Ana OC rates spiking even worse rest OC one office feels it’s necessary wear mask. I’m constantly disinfecting wearing mask hoping better since boss 80’s. there’s much do. Definitely. Reading city’s news page Facebook, comments people ridiculous. “Tyranny!” people sharing bullshit (see image)  support goes cause younger generations essentially savings imagine FOXNEWS actually reporting real news? work store sells video games, toys collectibles nothing essential. much normal products backordered worldwide right essential really made.
 
 would think I'm personally hoarding controllers fuck day. secret stash nintendo switch somewhere despite selling 3rd party sells double price selling fast

 city 1/4 countries cases worth 1/30 population. places people take shit seriously, nope morons day. Scarymommy? Certainly, handled well continue so, unfortunate reality not. we’ll face consequences that, even though could see coming mile away. Yea, and? None enlightening negate anything said. justify stock market risktaking supposed risk. Then, market crashes due something unforseeable, bail market piles upon piles printed cash big fail. problem. days, wealthy people cash. invest everything, that's way make money make money. downside supposed might lose money - anymore! We'll print money give lose much. rich literally lose. wait gets lmao Considering we're currently 128,000 deaths, would guessed number would We're averaging 1,500 deaths per day 180,000 deaths end July. one half country anti-science I’m going go ahead say die sure. could Trump call in, does, tell they're danger Americans suggesting mask wearing akin denying someone freedom choice.

It's fucking insane he's this. He'd win second term handily showed amount leadership. sure definition control is, found 7 cases Beijing yesterday Galaxy brain   entire family (that don’t live ) got sick tested. IM honestly deathly afraid 3 year old father. joke guys. Yeah NYC would $200 left paying rent, even cover utils let alone food. That’s interesting. thought visiting Australia long ago. guess I’ll stay away Americans disliked much. can’t imagine many countries really like Americans especially president doing. that’s I’m fantasizing leaving country. pay taxes president wants use tear gas peaceful protestors. That’s feel it. Oh well rate thank replying neat meeting you! *Baskin research suggests everyone wearing masks public correctly combined distancing measures transmission disease greatly reduced. unfortunately help restaurant/hospitality industry. Direct payouts instead paycheck prevention program would much better ensure money allocated appropriately. no. longer wants constituents live. governor's mansion still closed tours opening back would line CDC guidelines. Shity sounds like you’re comparing infection fatality rate COVID-19 all-cause mortality rate. isn’t really proper comparison, tbh. Also, followed link couldn’t find 0.4% rate 70 anywhere. Maybe I’m slave 4 U action. madness. can't ignore away. least I’m wearing mask distancing. I’d stay home wasn’t indentured servant. don’t feel safe work don’t care aren’t anything (no masks, distancing, cleaning). Given mess response we've had, think that's option. honestly highly doubt get much cooperation second lockdown, especially given death rate still decreasing turns deadly people initially thought. 

I badly wish coordinated, competent federal response virus ship sailed long ago. Herd immunity is, choice.  thing Texas amount obesity general population adds risk factors. Perfect storm doom despair


Economies shut weeks 100% wealthy people want go back work make money. sort reason couldn’t done both? I’m talking companies getting funding need stay afloat, I’m assuming case one work for. There’s reason either lose career given enough live can’t work. fact felt given choice upset about. 

What I’m talking corporations financial responsibility (and fiscal capacity) prepared period like getting millions dollars unregulated funds that, surprise surprise, effectively censored public eye. don’t even know much corporations handed. current administration feels unnecessary inform us tax dollars doled out. original name “kill grandma festival” didn’t play well social, revise name poor/mixed messaging. Improper advice. Overreaction beginning. Arbitrary treatment activities groups based political slant group. Politicians say one thing another. erode trust leadership, regardless party. 

I’ll wearing mask possible makes people feel better. don’t know works particularly well, there’s scenario envision causing harm (no matter Fauci initially said) frankly, it’s really small thing do, like washing hands, using hand sanitizer, staying home sick.  Immunocompromised Arizonan - people left quarantine? Handle what? Everything fine. Nothing fire. COVID norm. blows US economy always comes roaring back. Europe much always slow recover. Compare US recovery recessions EU. There's comparison. don’t get point post comments. Yes, it’s good news vacuum right current moment. also potentially harmful could lead people treat FL’s surging cases seriously otherwise would. 

A smaller percentage severe cases overall still extremely large raw number denominator big enough.

Also, future reference, champing* (not chopping) bit idiom you’re thinking of. 65%? That's entire population assholes morons. use issuing ultimatum blind privilege ignorance tomorrow? gold. They're talking meat. gross, never less, morbid curiosity. never happen. entrenched ""just flu"" mentality.

I cut ties friend said wear mask itches. said unless 10% fatality rate - isnt worth concern. said wouldnt even blink 2 million Americans died this.

His job drive around town delivering food. said die... wear mask. 

I mean least consistent... risking death country wear masks.  give Cuomo credit whatsoever. presided catastrophic outbreak coronavirus seen anywhere world point pandemic. disaster New York. Let’s completely ignore 600 week unemployment.  trust China, add three zeros, that's true number exactly think happens employees companies revenue?

A 6 month reprieve huge employees. Exactly. End handouts. taxes pay essential worker going someone's free vacation. wearing mask, ya gona started importing China.

You know, right China bought 3m's entire supply. 

I'm sure selling legit stuff back us, Texas breaks 6k cases. people brainwashed robots. Lack education problem think. nazis carried holocaust college educated many cases, Dr Mengele also known Angel Death instance. Lol get you. cut middleman? dispel fiction there's bug program.

Oh actually thinking youre saying delivery system end, regardless governments everaged already there, could seen systems essential goods handled much controlled manner always thought. 
 I've single content like that. live like 3 adults split household chores bills. Makes sense Considering we're currently 128,000 deaths, would guessed number would higher. 

We're averaging 1,500 deaths per day 180,000 deaths end July. Taiwan lives aunt uncle. proud. top story FOXNEWS right now. means 45% Americans absolute morons. That's part bugs most. even need date. qualifications say end lockdown? No. Say someone made 20 million January.... spent all.

Now need food. Give 1000$ month too.

If go back making 20 million month, hey pay back taxes next year.

Give EVERYONE. Means test repayment side later, pandemic. problem mask wearing become highly politicized. agendas cause biased opinions matter. true test, best way uncover truth protective qualities masks dig pre-covid literature find unbiased studies. that, simply won’t find anything suggests wearing masks protects people public. Yet millions sheeple who’ve bought shit; masks amount little cult symbols people wear indicate stupid tricked mainstream peer pressure. everyone world gullible. look literature find actual scientific answers scientific questions problems Interesting use estimated death rate (IFR) flu CFR coronavirus. Hmmmm.... Gracias helpful info! individual right life liberty pursuit happiness. region 600,000 persons put lockdown again. cases raising indeed. Don’t mean say median death rate COVID-19 infected people 70 0.04% 0.4% ? Well last week vacation, spent driving around town looking closed places. literally nothing do, everything closed. Thought flying Maine, flights there, lodging certainly wasn't.  Every place tried closed AIRBNB's would refuse let room even two days. 

We walk every day. ever moved states away before? That's exponential growth looks like. heard doctor t.v.say still first wave might continue like this. Dr. Michael Osterholm infectious disease specialist teaches University Minnesota says virus us 60 70 percent people country infected. estimates takes consideration mindset population far following health precautions, mask wearing, distancing, hand washing. Etc. Well, says all. anti-mask people fulfill prediction. arrogance outrageous. guess care infect families. 65% Americans introverts One difficult parts returning office... rona mostly able work nude. Natural selection, please thing. looked history making judgement stand it.  Yum! universities planning going fully online, see.

Schools crèche exception, children’s parents need work universities don’t dependency wouldn’t even space socially distance level people. Allowing Texans go bars right like allowing governor Abbott drive wheelchair Houston interstate. 

I vote allow governor capability- respecting personal freedoms all. Get well dude. I'm really sorry hear this. felt crazy cousin's husband died visit corpse. Since then, I've pretty grateful state assistance, reimbursed fostering dog, spend time walking dog, reading writing. I'm lucky. people lucky. get it. I'm also glad I'm alive. If? They're sitting 35,000 cases day, far higher pretty much anywhere else. much spike need? Trump fucked royally. mean people dying numbers knows telling us truth anymore. fucking sad  reached Masterclass contain outbreak. Authoritharism perks  said nothings wrong here? Strawman mf. Sad. typical. Saying everyone US socialized healthcare blatantly false statement lol. China's 90 million tests, population 1.4 billion 64,000 tests per million. less United States 90,000 tests per mission. America still testing China. !remindme 2 weeks reputation vaccines whole

You're right here. misstep could one important vaccines long time could completely devastating society. fuel antivax crazies, empower recruit many ranks. least central Florida, fiancé looking move every property wanted taken 4-5 days posted. plenty people still looking housing, least here.

A rough shot math puts ~2.5M cases. There's non-zero chance many deaths time over...

Even put us deaths per capita rate Italy, long way go... going one interesting ride. Astonishing leader act way, South. Measured decisions steeped science, adjusted based results. Politics taken back burner Cooper, working hard protect people, regardless political affiliation.

You creating legacy actions, sir. Keep good work. Awkward Yes. 50 year old cousin caught it. Lost 30% lung function told would lifelong. poll people. People matter US. politicians businesses proved pandemic. even poll people more? opinions, even en masse, matter. mean look stock market kind smells way, right?

Large national meat packing plants get special liability shields, Target, Walmart, Amazon turning record profits, airlines cruise ship companies headed massive bailouts.

Meanwhile Joes Coffee shop ghost town trying convince people getting served coffee behind plastic shield someone latex gloves mask totally worth getting bed remote job instead making yourself.  use neck gaiters close contact people

But getting better design always wonder get numbers like 58%. right mind would ever wash 💩 let alone admit loud washing hands afterwards?! kind shocking virus mostly bypassed Western Pennsylvania. state? dog weighs enough sets seat belt buzzer. Sometimes buckle behind shut up. 

But really you’re better buckling up!  bunch drive thru places get tested free symptoms? places now. 40% police officers abuse spouses. know. point, everybody going get it. stopping it. Ugh, sucks. I'm sorry!  Don’t forget mass protests pretty much made everyone fence say “fuck that” 1000s marching proximity everyone’s supposed social distancing, expect? 

I’m gonna blame fucking media this. realized weren’t making money virus anymore, switched gears started mass covering that. sensationalized riots claiming juicy ad revenue. knew matter time stop covering it. lot blame current issues virus. toilet paper shortages beginning people thinking disappeared. 

Regulate media! Natural selection...please thing. Realized comment disingenuous guess?

Here's argue good stimulus package lot different things loans direct support specific industries piece it.  can’t intelligent nationwide plan

Because intelligent nation. leadership unintelligent incapable planning. worst fucking bot reddit. majority people world *just* smart enough avoid “Death Darwin Award” reproduce. Wtf? O.o

I evictions .. stupid procrastinating moratoriums... thought guy explained EVERYTHING trolling.. answered agreed added system uphill battle least Omg would great.. dont tease us man. They're sure playing close. know sometime July, damn figured would announcement now. North Dakota - state 5th largest nuclear power earth. Exactly u think making up? thought common knowledge.

One time forgot wear one work, use one backups holy crap finding every excuse take thing day long. lockdown might come beds overwhelmed, might mid-late July states. think places putting lot faith masks slow things, doubt effective stay-at-home orders. Best case scenario would flattening early July, allows hospitals maintain high-but-sustainable patient situation. I've seen, great adherence masks places like bars restaurants negate usage. CDC maintained site heat map sewage sampling results every major US metro area? want know us 46-54 year olds don’t get fucking vote!? way see number hospitalizations due covid? know close hospital reaching capacity? knowing close ventilator ""shortage."" entire point locking ""slow curve"" overwhelm medical industry, ""stay inside wait cure."" think preparing lockdown cases spiking still plenty hospital space resources. cases going people getting handling fine without hospital visit, that's different thing believe. extra $600 week unemployment runs end July, although savings need job come back get going again. I'm fairly certain much larger percentage us risk financially dying even getting really sick covid. need women ruling class too. going waste 11/10 low level coffee boy. Jeeeeez. OK. That's like different planet. 

I thought people dumbasses see people walking neighborhood without masks dinnertime (Which sidewalk busiest). people still crossing street even walking street avoid coming close, half people outside masks, 100% compliance bitching last time ventured costco supplies.

Everyone home stayed home 100% since LATE FEBRUARY. mental health trash now. go every 3 weeks resupply single store (that way I'm confident get sick exactly caught help contact tracing efforts, know give anyone outside home.) 

It feels like everyone else reckless trapping us home longer needlessly increasing suffering name stubborn ignorance anti-intellectualism/anti-science bias. wish people gave shit, gave tremendous enough shit could get back something acceptable SOONER. look europe, look Taiwan, look Japan little apart masks - mask compliance taking seriously dramatically slows spread. instead 2 weeks away another shutdown somewhere US. get posting good things clear signs improvement? can't wait see good news. I'm chopping bit it. Take care! So... saying wearing mask effect? sobering reminder virus still circulating Michigan northern Michigan. need continue vigilant practice social distancing, wearing mask mindful far over,”    group visitors traveled together around Grand Traverse County first June 18 wine-tasting tour, followed bar-hopping outing June 19.

I’ll listen opinion leading epidemiologists, someone reddit’s friend’s surgeon allegedly said. stand corrected that. Anybody know government officials held liable way future dust settled? sort governor-size qualified immunity? Voting necessary, seems like really light penalty type gross murderous misconduct/incompetence. Yeh many would extra 600. Ireland, EU. insisted every airline refund full they'd bankrupt one would get saw theory, possibly /r/conspiracy, cut $600 off, protestors actually go back work since theorized bulk ones about. 

In odd way makes sense. go back job, get paid sleep day protest night. mom fucked last night xD confirmation vitamin link illegals ones keeping food production going sits ass watching Hannity. case already debunked. person initially tested negative, tested positive week Vietnam. likely got Vietnam. I’ll admit Jacksonville resident skeptical. However know better disappointed people aren’t taking seriously. Well-worded, friend. I'm real tough time holding safe course action see many making 0 sacrifices COVID-19 least feel hard done by. Everyone game lock eradicate virus long stable life come back done

I stable life *before* started one ""come back to"" over. health insurance I'm much worried getting sick medical debt would murder given already bad financial situation. 

I get point trying say please pretend speak everyone. legit views good erase them. saw too, wild, think also entirely warranted. kinds mentality privilege lead person believe willfully expose another human potentially lethal pathogen need met extreme prejudice. Seriously, people claim nothing would've better Hillary charge now? particularly bright earthworm would probably handled better Trump. like lockdown simply less work stay home. It’s mainly fear coronavirus rather convenience provides. Even astronomically unlikely event completely right grand conspiracy, making someone wear mask hardly ""crime humanity"" Restaurants really busy lot places lot aren’t even meeting compliance. Gyms reopened last week probably add spread. probably means people higher tax bracket might getting infected near future. that’s takes get taken seriously it. look like ground? people starting stay home still packing bars restaurants? Happy Cake Day! hope they’ll keep rallies Sometimes I’ll see nurse doctor grocery store look beyond exhausted. hope family well we’ll get sooner rather later. saw another one them. well covid. Why? long public wearing mask prove work though? serious question. Thanks, dude. Yeah, also use Hospital ship 21m dollar hospital elderly tested positive sent back old peoples homes instead causing thousands needless deaths. athletes seem never severe case? much great shape increase chances fighting off?

Has age anything. viral pic super ripped male nurse fought covid months looked emaciated end it.  sure guys at. week day there's still pretty much nothing rush hours. Weekend going Maine/Cape beaches much. Deaths usually lag cases, trend seem lower percentage cases leading death. think lot earlier cases hit nursing homes people vulnerable. Canada least, huge percentage deaths nursing homes. Now, spreading general population much higher survival rates. Also, I'm hoping treatment getting better learn virus. even then, certainly people downplay it, doubt it, disregard it’s happening one city. fact president very, likely one people terrifying. 

If still anyone doesn’t think would, better think again. anyone still hasn’t seen story, everyone entire country definitely should, openly willing suggest 75yo man buffalo got knocked police, fractured skill, yet able walk, antifa provocateur trying jam police scanners create setup police. video incident tweet. 

And person give hot take video determine literal millions, definitely 1/3 US, decides think it. feel like I'm getting irrationally angry people wear masks point.

Ever since March sub turned Coronavirus USA 9/10 threads USA. someone live there, feel sorry frontline staff busting asses everyday others show blatant disregard humanity semblance empathy MuH RIgHtS! No, would mean lying earlier said wasn’t big deal. pretends it’s still big deal, keeps ego intact, cares Congress extend late night close vote holdouts rewarded pork. hate politicians. understand flattening curve portion hospitalization treatments short term highly effective long shot. timeline year end vaccine impossible could see realistic treatment plan severe cases lower death rate would us nearly year spread.

It's emotionally exhausting watching lack care people distance mask wearing public really wonder many actually it. household back March due work wife seemed severe symptoms 7 people house. seen studies many actually much higher Feb Mar spread testing. 

I'm saying go back normal understand op's concern long hold need balance true leadership currently neither.  Lol, look past countries continent hardly lockdows, wore masks took seriously. 

If proof massive dumbing down, know give wake-up call desperately need. Still climate change deal with. Houston covid pts 27% 97%, see TMC graph ICU bed availability. 

BTW, Houston Medical Center biggest world 20 hospitals. Mostly think main purpose social distancing slow spread(at least people saying beginning pandemic) number people going get didn’t want increase deaths overwhelming hospitals. think vaccine effective due mutations(as seen flu vaccines) know may impossible eradicate virus(like flu example) unless dies own(there way you. 100 percent stop people spreading US unless possibly herd immunity reached(if that’s possible) live TN apartment complex make appointment use pool, allowed one hour time limit list long. think they’re letting like 4 5 people time. don’t ever use pool there’s lot families complex, kids annoy me, seems like even college complexes same. It’s literally steroid, steroids known toxic drugs worst side effects, something want prescribing frequently help it. little county Iowa seen cases last three days last three months 🤡  predict MLB, NFL, college football schools closed fall (and happen) people get clue. Watch. wonder what’s next. Something like: “We created powerful tests world. powerful tests make healthy people fill hospitals ICUs.” wouldn’t surprised still people would buy rhetoric. can't even include word ""protests"" amid parade horrors describe, comment dismissed hand.

And agree protests responsible pandemic, there's scant evidence they've contributed rise cases. evidence rest us privy to? Idiots refusing wear masks governments recklessly open businesses far likely explanation. geography spike cases rather suggestive poor leadership, inspired Trump, substantial contributing factor. probably unfortunately Explains lot it. sorry hear still feeling better. Hoping see positive improvements due time. 

Thanks sharing us. king dumbass know flu spreads schools? spreads like fucking wildfire bring home everyone. 1 case elementary school whole district would lockdown start game again, means states cranking unemployment credit cards again. financial responsibility contractual obligations suspended lockdown. Rent, mortgages, car payments, interest credit cards, internet... Worldometer it. That's case numbers peak, almost 10k. Nightmare. Things aren’t much better T-State either fear we’ll guys time next month. governor useful dog vomit. stay home order literally month April let restaurants retailers non-metro counties begin reopening order expired too. Texas 3rd tested state US. There's enough data. Even think that's enough, go California, tested New York, still closer Texas death counts. Brilliant idea   serious doubt record don’t want break. unfortunately, leader still want us break record every day Every country Europe save San Marino, Belguim, Andorra, UK, Spain, Italy, Sweden, France better US deaths per capita according amazingly well. Germany visible. Many eastern southern European countries done even better. can't think single place US said well. NY well now, obviously before. Joplin MO know dude said care unless 25% American die. Well downside virus could spread seem managing pretty well here. course hundred cases across whole country. didn’t even realize it. open calendar count. I’m 100 too! Asthmatic wearing mask Phoenix heat. Honestly, cotton mask much easier wear N95s I’ve worn sanding. 

I feel good protecting fellow community members, something others apparently went wrong life. I'm starting wonder infection lingers much longer people presenting symptoms. I'm talking month two. would explain cases highly contagious disease early January numbers explode March. Superspreader events definitely part it, too. fact find many asymptomatic (or presymptomatic) cases places know there's problem leads believe might lie dormant people far longer. really see someone calling cops black man looking “threatening” wearing mask? Remember dude GA gunned jogging, killers assumed must criminal.

What selective enforcement? Cops across country selectively enforce laws like jaywalking black people way fuck them. could easily see cop using black people without masks piggy bank municipal fines.

Like get you’re coming from, virus doesn’t care are... many people country, wearing mask could dangerous virus itself. oh wow, may problems grandpa working hospital. Yikes! Best luck family! Probably arguing caught mic Let's help essential workers virtue signaling jet fly-by, surely protect them! kid gets tips delivering pizzas. store bills untouched week, pay phone cash. lot smaller bills, usually pay cash without needing change.

Florida 5500 positive tests yesterday. 
20% positive rate. 10% last week. whistle-blowers already. may seem like ignoring things favor one virus. one virus something new makes can't breathe possibly die. healthcare system designed treat LOT people get sick time. one main reasons priority. Mental health, social fabric, economy historically suffered society people getting sick dying time. 

Does answer question?   order came wake discovery — hours president’s Saturday evening rally — least six advance staffers helped organize trip tested positive virus, **including two Secret Service employees**. Another two advance staffers tested positive Trump returned Washington Sunday real. spent weekend Minnesota Wisconsin Even Rochester someone civilized.... little mask use.  lol right unbelievable people aren’t thinking Anne fucking Frank trying times 😂 

“oh weak are!” NY? state epicenter?  don’t clue 214 million people doing. single clue. understand happened California. began everyone patting back writing hot takes California (LA particular) handling everything much better New York. beat us second wave everything fall apart opened stupid shit like gyms soon? Look, it’s job explain difference protesting racial equality wanting grab cocktail crowded bar. will, however, reiterate well-established fact virus MUCH less likely spread outdoors compared indoors-even less likely majority people wearing masks. upvotes one? Management knew yet another miracle treatment loses sparkle reality comes knocking. honestly wish people would slow roll things. media headlines NEW GAME CHANGING DRUG PROMISING YET give people lot false hope wrong impression. People desperately want latch little shred hope right hopping one major cope next can't mind lot favours long term. Thinking little hard this? Everyone wear fuckin mask, matter anyone 'feels' may make someone look. going that, point then: 


imagine giving 50% margin error (80k, +/- 40k) STILL wrong...


Just tell people safe (and how) accept can't predict... I'm surprised put ""MAGA"" mask make buck pandemic.  What’s scary ones getting really sick aren’t considered risk population. Like 17 year old Florida died. hypocrisy cringey. music, could *without* crowd. They're really looking music. want crowd. almost like states LETTING hold events there, that's reason coronavirus cases. Just... wear mask?! Hey man I've rough days, family issues new stressful job.

Cooler weather. Texas summers hellish people want spend time outside unless they're going beach pool. evidence U.S. increase cases due increase testing summed with:

“Trust me, you’d understand smarter.”

I think I’m gonna stick actual statistics one. Congressional earmarking banned years ago - actually big reason difficult negotiate bills. used needed sway votes, could find vulnerable Congressmen throw money bridge bill. way, could go back constituents campaign season say ""look jobs brought back!"" practice gone, Congressmen digging heels ideology refusing budge purity tests.

Nobody likes seeing sausage made, something needs done ends store shelf. go stick instead carrot. Since people shown logic empathy voluntarily comply pandemic measures, force them. Roll National Guard Lombardi/Wuhan lockdown, freeze rents debt payments, pay everyone monthly stipend essentials good head. many people understand magnitude coming supply chain issues progresses. virus exposing weaknesses. ill prepared.

100% agreed - everyone loading up. are, making actually easy right now. Reminds loading January. could describe practically point human history. Yes, everyone. Old young. Many young people acting invincible right now. fine get virus. they’re spreading people fine. think they’ll fine. realizing contagious is. Honestly I’m Toronto area say handled well perspective, opening back right going see effects next month so. I’m expecting partial shutdowns again. NZ now, quarantine (importantly) allowing people borders immediately go self-isolation (they going transmit virus anyone already NZ). Asked decision test agents presidential trips coronavirus, Secret Service official said protecting agency personnel critical Covid-19 pandemic.
""We want make sure healthy workforce protecting people,"" official said. ""This good common sense.""

Testing good common sense, eh? seems unlikely. would far simpler bring plasma White House rather bringing president Walter Reed. understand, White House pretty robust medical unit handle lot...seems like performing transfusion wouldn’t unfeasible, raises questions actually bad enough justify trip first place... Maybe defund police people onto something believe stimulus economic support relieved purpose- mistaken. Let clear- Feds well Trump ensure survivability economy costs. Look Cares Act extended overruled greater predecessor. I’ve literally never felt cooped up. I’ve quarantining decade. that's roughly 10x deaths 9/11, yet shrugs stupid fucking flag wavers deafening. Nevermind total deaths. Incorrect beliefs, likely thinks masks part larger sinister agenda ending mandatory niqāb something We’re paying anyways since given banks.

They don’t know gonna pay either. treatments everything surrounding pandemic. Hell last month every media source saying ""cases SPIKE x"" despite discernible increase increases testing. we're eating shit president saying ""Well like increased testing fuck you."" spiking cases people threatening less testing here. think media blame lot things pandemic, especially ""panic porn"" headlines preprint articles hard case numbers. Who's laughing Lucha Libre exactly continue broken. everyone precisely used dice pick single hour day try get through, lot people would probably able file... explains cali Az, florida, texas south carolina ? maybe packing spray bottle spray dumbfucks get away us, means, works cats, might work animals cant win obeying rules thats designed lose talk colleague today otherwise smart guy apparently (I found out) believes ""just flu"" mantra. thinks COVID real thing firmly camp ""I'm going back normal"". like guy lot too.

So otherwise smart reasonable people convinced ""this flu""...we're basically fucked. where's Alice? car brands encouraging people go road trips deadly pandemic? I'm betting 600k year's end, since March. put money way things going. "" *a staggering 47 million Americans filed first time unemployment claims 14 weeks.*""

Incubation time virus averages 5 days. going see surges. Yeah. I'd love stay home right now, tell job fuck off. can't eat  feel bad healthcare workers. People need help instead expecting everything go fine professionals swoop save miracle. People risking health lives help, least everyone else wear mask. “If” Yes please someone, familiar. I’d love live world 100% mask usage, don’t think it’s realistic. It’s also important note law doesn’t say don’t wear mask black... says can’t punished don’t wear mask. could easily see police would let “patriots” refusing wear mask muh freedumbs, charging black people “endangering public health.” It’s sticky situation pitfalls sides. There’s justifiable fear support exception it. Plus let’s real amount white people refuse comply (eastern WA fuck ton crazies) entire state’s black population. Let’s focus getting comply first. Good call.. wonder majority Palm Beach feels. Every place crazies wouldn’t want pass judgement entire city based them. I’m sure media didn’t bother capturing anyone level headed supporting measure. know keep asking explanations truly don’t understand someone would say this. would steroids work severe cases COVID?   mean, kind is.

I think lot socioeconomic issues largely fact communities likely low paid essential jobs, live cramped situations multi-generational families, lack access quality healthcare, trust issues medical field (due past bad experiences). mention generational trauma lack access good food time prepare stress means health probably worse.

&amp;#x200B;

They've also done studies show hospital professionals bias towards Black women...mainly take pain seriously. “partially Government’s fault”.

We laws, rules guidelines place, day-to-day basis, can’t trust majority general public follow without fear repercussion.

The COVID situation different. Governments job lead failed so, epically, Texas.

They held higher standard general public. Say is, government prints money end paying inflation anyway. Yea, 180k control now.

I’m talking social butterfly situation old peope think entitled everyone else’s expense. Everyone stay fuck home protect others.  listen idiot mother law rant carry him. told knock grateful shes region canada leaders defer medical advice. didnt likely wouldnt position believe bullshit watches YouTube.

The point he’s supposed undermine governors stop state’s residents dying. laws schlitterbahn week I'm honestly worried them. supposed go live NYC seen bad get, obviously canceled flight back. want risk health health others putting tons effort lock down. 

They're still going fiance distraught it. makes feel better, I’ve hearing sentiment Portland too. last projection hear 127k Aug first. looks like gonna overshoot bit Really must suck try point fail hard. 

Many cancers semi elective. Things know, yeah need keep eye tumor, try remove months monitor then. would elective. knew tumor cancerous removed, wasnt directly life threatening, would schedule surgery future would semi-elective. tumor advanced threatened death, elective would rushed hospital. 

Their daughters cancer postponed elective, immediately life threatening would danger getting treatment time hospitals dangerous. 

Idk elective hard understand.


E: losers lives stalk others reddit profiles gain ammo personal attacks since actual points value. There's truth that, despite sarcasm. Cases going testing increases. However, look hospitalizations metric, see much clearer picture spread, growth, retreat, rebound, etc. Funny CNN never shows graphs reports metrics, even though purply-blue Colorado governor figured out. bit disconnect headline article. accurate headline would “These different types vaccines development”. that’s contemporary journalism.  guy's giving Rubio way much credit. read article he's still playing GOP denial game saying cases hospital erroneously attributed Covid reasons happen positive. matters Desantis telling DOH every news briefing none counts. rhetoric reopen. Notice Rubio say masks mandatory... said people wear them, would attempt actually anything it.

You get pretend like right thing done nothing all. He's position power states failures leaders right now, one. Maybe comment would mattered April half assed comment typical meek puppet like Rubio. Numbers going big deal long hospitals overwhelmed situation right now. Please, forget every time see new cases also patients recovering.

""70% occupied ICU beds Texas Medical Center system currently taken non-coronavirus patients, 27% occupied people tested positive fact national tracing consistent nation wide strategy *not* terrifying?

The fact states fend like scary.

Are happy every state approach? mean less protection? Unfortunately, getting majority wear masks never happen US. used little bit hope humanity, last 4 months pretty much dashed pieces. weekend daylight savings, get extra hour recover hangover makes immunocompromised girl slutty ________ costume.

Oh yeah, full moon happens every 18 19 years. hand sanitizer? even masks? think hand sanitizer going help reptilians control minds? I'm so, sorry going through. literally can't see difference NZ US pandemic situation, point. think can, decided obtuse, hard pass. It’s illegal close state borders Lol, couldn’t truth tried. How’s limb doing? wife labor type this. absolutely terrifying baby world fire. really think word is. like someone likes play 3D shooter game DOOM? Far cal almost zero compliance /cries Portlandese That’s lockdowns. It’s gonna get lot worse. Serology tests demonstrate IFR much color enough color qualify..?

Hispanic? Middle Eastern? Asian? Native American?

Do Italians qualify? 

This dumbest shit I've seen week. Everyone involved decision god damn moron. Lmfao made laugh considered low quality? I’m genuinely confused. fucking stupid look rest world

as non usa resident, say look REALLY fucking stupid words nearly 180,000 Americans die coronavirus October 1. pandemic happened Obama's time even dozen people died gop would want lynch it. would like say double standards, honestly standards. allergies cause post nasal drip, turn cause coughing. nightmare hahah.  old people come contact old people either accidentally intentionally? honest you, unhappy projections released....over 1 million. . . . noooooooooo(picture beaney glasses).


7k nearly scary far covid goes. really relieved. Return? I'm still locked down. :-/ They've repeated lies long enough came believe themselves.  PA last year 1,000 people died car accidents. 6,400 died PA coronavirus 3 months. Sure seems lot deadlier me. really don’t know became political, yeah full rally protesting masks. Google it, one state reps even quoted “I can’t breathe” taking mask doesn’t shut couple minutes? That's true large portion Canada point minimal cases. example live opened businesses seeing 1-2 new cases day. US could much better shape people stubborn dismissive. Except want buy politician election, person purposes free speech. Good times. much. $20,000/person population 330 million equates 6.6 trillion dollars spent. go adults, 209 million still 5 trillion dollars. moron! 

The government asking wear masks protection. Sorry it’s health issue dimwit. Canadians generally wearing masks much USA. Sorry many dying you’re touch think it’s political issue lol. 

PS whole world looks USA like look Tiger King. hilarious laughter.  Trumps injected BS nation result.Man...what country. used kid wanted live US

Im glad live now...absolute shit show fronts. Every developed nation earth doesn’t single payer. single payer, don’t.  what, one time $1200 check good enough you? 

/s Sorry say bud, going get lot worse gets better.... yes course., provide relief... \*turns head senators, whispers\* go donors (or owners?) pockets  Right back you. don’t deny concern. buddy got bad news you, life full risks.  actually 200,000 predicted week two ago. So, uh, good news? Young people also likely forced back work places high risk exposure.

If society wants feeling fuck it. boomers government don’t like fucking shut us provide financial relief. They’re ones die. don’t like call fucking representatives like March April. would accounted selecting sample population. 2-week period March 23 April 7, 2020, total five patients (including aforementioned patient) younger 50 years age presented new-onset symptoms large-vessel ischemic stroke. five patients tested positive Covid-19. comparison, every 2 weeks previous 12 months, service treated, average, 0.73 patients younger 50 years age large-vessel stroke.

The papers show significant rate increase strokes. live lacked restaurants? province peaked 32 new cases 2 day allowed 50 percent capacity restaurants still think going lucky happen every 100 years now. think going happen increasing frequency. selfish asshole. People like care affects negatively. *""It's problem, happen me, someone else fix it""* mentality going downfall country USA..

It's sad see people life exactly did.   maybe Yup Really 50% 50% certain areas certain times... Really random  but...doom!!!! NEED DOOM!!!  mean? thought employers could make vaccines mandatory, i.e. tell people can't come back work they've vaccinated. 40% Anerican anti vaxxers

That's even remotely true. small percentage, they're unfortunately, vocal obnoxious it. Honestly think lot rise social media, too. conspiracy theories people touting absolutely asinine. popular one r/conspiracy coronavirus cover get us houses new world order/a comet strike supposed happen April. new story Dallas last night interviewing teachers possible student return fall.  One teacher said return high risk.... 

 Sitting there, 7 people, closed room, masks.. maybe 4-5 feet apart. supporters. religious. people put fucking masks.... need lockdown. would nice SARs-CoV-2 virus ears, would obey orders.

People, ears choose obey orders, stop virus cold. is, ..., wear masks, keep distance people.

The political leaders can, choose, convince people that.

But blame virus. people made choices, fault. guess NJ, Governor Murphy seems get little notice credit, I'm amazed we're state that's continues mandatory masks public. see wanting risk since densely populated state, seems like done nationwide.  % want quarantine live Florida. NC - I'm amazed got enacted all. I'm NC amount anti-mask rhetoric fb feed nauseating. feeling rapid increase cases last week finally made sink in. glad live more, also glad see pass health family friends still living there. 21 states reporting highest numbers cases, government failed get message Coronavirus kill healthy people, regardless age. 

The number people survive face lifetime disability still well understood. 

80% people willing roll dice deadly disease. *If*? If??

The US today second highest day total new cases 36,100 (and counting).

This thing blowing far control. least April topic news covering everyone sort still taking seriously. we're place serious ever people seem taking seriously all.

The US lucky hit 500,000 deaths rate. 65% Americans realize lockdown kills way people virus. look moving average worldometer John Hopkins clearly moving up. That's democracy works ideal republic though. whole point representatives listen loudest voices necessarily. buy first home, educated anatomy house.

Seriously fucked hard this. at? Seems similar me, central indiana Hahah someone comment this, happy happened 😂😁 think NJ+NY+New England zone states seem situation well control. It’s rough. Like, I’m sure things get back normal ONE DAY, vague hope things maybe possibly getting better potentially years doesn’t exactly get day day scary headlines quarantine. that's discussing. line could bottomed would still worrying see start go again. Osterholm Joe Rogan Mar 10 - Yawn Wait assholes arrive scream ""doomers"" Yes it’s probably last resort possible.

I guess I'm saying fuck Marco Rubio bag rusty nails. Here’s hoping. also heavily depends area surveyed. it’s urban centers lockdown support rises, it’s rural falls drastically.

It's pretty easy walk CVS NY get flu vaccine, appointment needed cases. course speaking now, Florida epicenter now. knows history make look like shit doesn’t even pretend act. come effect? curious. wife couple weeks ago. Arizona requiring masks public spaces. I'm gonna hose gets back... lol...just checking central Indiana ... like back forth masks... certain employers, workers required general public like 50% back forth... including myself... odd random mask where. surprised get mandatory laws end summer...  want shut little bell rings every time I'm wearing one.  I’m feeling lot despair today too. ❤️ Interesting, continues, places took chin March fine vice versa  6 months long time, delays inevitable American Patriots: ""I'll DIE country!""

America: ""Hey, please wear mask?""

American Patriots: ""{crickets}""  mask-less shouting enclosed space.. *shudders*. Careful. thing tells planning gut ss services this. see writing wall.. something good true always catch. Shit really bad. think actually happened, least states making attempt lockdowns, federal government asleep wheel running money.

We could managed lockdowns federal government took lead gave money states. never wearing mask. Beat it. True. live 3rd world country many people can't even afford buy long term culture strongly opposes idea wearing masks. Yet people starting regularly.

US crazy mode rn. Trump said last couple days deaths falling cases rose testing much. idiot, rise cases take couple weeks start increasing death figures... Sorry political please ban me. imagine ""lockdown"" everyone received kit government n95 masks, gloves, hand sanitizers. lockdown stores business remained open, extremely strict enforcable distancing measures. San Francisco seeing steep rise parts state. Ok read diary? that's exactly it. test anyone nobody confirmed positive. 🤷‍♂️ amazing people care enough people country suck what's right....must nice. China Jan 23 seeing instant reaction small town gov anything something amazing see...then stupidly came back US essentially rest country need tests, apply testing resources whole country one small area. Whereas US test 0.2% population day need everywhere locally (and course, organization coordinating help), China also surely test least 0.2% population day focus tons tests city Beijing want to. 

I wondered tested Wuhan (1% country's population) earlier. publicity stunt? Building public confidence get economy back track? Spending lot find one typhoid Mary contact tracing catching? Maybe things, maybe practice next major city outbreak.

(* edit - 0.2%, 2%, US) consider people want watch world burn.  saying 180k total, graph: difference USA, Canada handling situation unreal  That's 100 days ago? Damn, sense time really went haywire. counting total number people infected, number currently infected.. *when read dudes post history, mild cold said everyone else dying virus bunch cowards. Kung-flu match texas cowboys. thing could possibly make difference humidity, makes people cough more. warmer temperatures worse. None experiencing person. even close. You’re delusional haven’t actually participated things IRL think going concert watching live stream concert thing.

I’m saying sacrifices shouldn’t made don’t full shit. lot countries populations don’t really make point pride party papa papa’s papa voted for. lot vote person, party, person runs on, party 100 years ago. places, makeup government proportional representation, etc.

 22 years able vote, regularly gone back forth candidates supported even members party disliked three candidates prior, on. may consider socially left, won’t “claim” one party, “right” parties still left, won’t rule supporting “right” party actually may lean socially left fiscally right, etc.

American politics whole different ballgame, apparent team pride party, lack parties, electoral college, on. 2.5m 70% country infected assumed fatality rate 1%. literally nothing. electing adult president important. Trump's ignorance abdication responsibility turned national crisis complete disaster weaponized ignorant among us tools destruction. inconsiderate people thinks joke won’t get sick. America...  LA huge increase protests far larger NY. NY’s contract tracers asking cases attended protests. There’s nothing handle, apparently. country refusing acknowledge there’s pandemic. problem US already lock down, many states half assed never properly, support less adequate federal govt. making problem better, even impact, they're actively making worse.

Now either lockdowns virus run rampant. lock work go party over.

The US like 7x many active cases Canada *per capita.* Canada perfect example happens provincial government control problem even federal help - like 90% active cases Québec right now. Everywhere else dramatically improving. UK; optional 15th June, less likely catch coronavirus 15th June. 
Some shops closing 6pm, likely catch virus 6pm. 

'Vertical drinking' (standing drinking alcohol) pubs also banned, likely catch whilst standing sitting. [3500 COVID-19 patient study says different. 0.9% ischemic stroke rate all-ages hospitalizated patients ridiculously high (because young patients typically large ischemic strokes,) mortality give idea high is, stroke admissions, historically, 195 per 100,000 0.195% really. isn’t committing genocide. However, extraordinarily fucked worthy scorn derision. question really distracts. isn’t literally Hitler doesn’t mean isn’t mass murderer deserves jail “Ask country you, ask country

... unless involves piece cloth mouth, that’s much” Cali more. 37 519 now. Interestingly goes 38 534 7 day rolling average hit record. 50% Americans can't pay emergency $500.  It’s probably already killed lot people would die flu. Similar demographic. virus care grocery store, essential worker, either, eating keeping country running also important. Managing risk goal, 100% protection. Yep. need overthink it. Nope. wear one. want. Mr. McMahon Triple H literally burying whole roster. alternative people die can’t take prolonged layoff? trying dick here, serious question. Biden. He’s total clinch! Totally different Hillary! /s Keeping mind fact current administration trying keep people mail voting, think hindrance? I'll blame protesters rioters. 10 pounds dumb stuffed 5 pound box. Isn’t personal responsibility going you’re ok risk staying inside aren’t ok it?  That’s weird problem pandemic. everyone totally locked barely cases, people would mad “nothing”. don’t realize numbers would protective measures taken Money put stocks disappear. goes person sold stocks. buy stocks, buy things.

Money put savings disappear, either. banks leverage make loans, like mortgages, etc.  Sadly speculation mostly likely true. That's excess deaths best measurement.  WW3 tier event

We quite literally even remotely close event. You’re overly dramatic.

This pandemic isn’t even “that bad” terms pandemics, it’s worst we’ve while. meant Easter 2022. Simple mistake make. 1. 1.4 think initial denials hurt right disbanding epidemic response team Awwww, hurt feewings? Trump calling Xi test less. much worse situation politically hands.

It infuriating lose 3 months wages, open everything “phases.” meant phase 1-4 one fucking week. new plan, pretty much #yolo. 

I wasted three months work quarantine, owe ton money credit, reason we’re seeing spread more, complete fuck up, cowardice leaders. They’re “debating” mask mandates. daily cases higher forced quarantine. fuck debate? Whether small crew inbred fucks watch Foxnews think you? must pander dumbest fucks country, constantly. 

They’ve lost trust, good people. Cops violent ever, us completely tapped money. Fuck country. Fuck moron anti-science red hat fools. Fuck self entitled idiots can’t troubled read, perform simple act keep others getting sick. Honestly, think might best shit rips America, decimates population everyone realize reality tv stars, religious nonsense, apathetic fools control narrative, leadership. Europe talking suspending travel Americans. Unfortunately true. increase hospitalizations represents lag least 2-3 weeks compared infections. means virus spreading time now, almost uncontrollably, numbers show yet.

I won’t surprised projections hospitalizations Texas Medical Center underestimated... boat. filed, approved, received funds. Cant get automated system. last 400.00 bucks. dont know going yo rent month. Good find! found states 68-72%.

There also this, specific Houston area, showing “moderate concern” range show normal occupancy around 62%, think, math correct, probably isn’t.

Thank you! see numbers now. much 🌞 fried brains. people always stay hurricanes need saved.  “I don’t take responsibilities all.” —Trump Always been. Puerto Rico? God speed.

Big ups fuck ups. lmao Jesus auto-redialer? everyone people get where. cluster fuck. really want get it?

Robots everything yet. People need work ensure folks eat, electricity, indoor plumbing, etc. I'm UBI, NEWS FLASH, everyone's proposed UBI less roughly equivalent(as children getting 4k/yr makes perfect comparison impossible) 7.25/hr year, folks still need work live unless choose move place unlivable wage illegal.

Having companies pay less liveable wage government subsidize efficient losing meaningful percentage jobs people surviving completely welfare.

Additionally, federal minimum wage livable wage medium high CoL areas. low-mid low CoL. Local stare jurisdictions handle higher CoL.

I'd love live Star Trek world, arent yet. yes, system in. Medicare 4 would great, ain't going pop overnight so, yes, need handle pamdemic system have.

And, finally, yes, need keep critical industries afloat. Letting companies lifeblood economy go belly reckless idealism. would great could survive without aid (well, no, really companies sitting massive amounts cash hand terrible growth economy), happening eventually new airlines would rise up, letting shit hit fan interim terrible. fuck? literally worst thing could position. Cases multiplying like crazy. states approaching 100% capacity. ground impeachment trial humanitarian crimes. What's complicated understanding virus care reasoning around people close proximity. post clear, ignoring wrote, adding random interpretation. 

Maybe read people wrote, dont like 80 morons board brains. proven outdoors protests people wearing masks caused spikes. sad part: 
When first start many traditional (religious) cultures want wear them, particularly Islam Evangelical Christian groups, though know why.

Most places see light. here, political struggle you, dumbass, going cause way spread deaths virus ever needed be. Holy crap sick seeing idiots get kind attention, “let show YouTube vid explains throwing literally scientific medical data hoax” 

This crap serious consequences. Way many professionals actually trying right thing stepping due increased threats morons like one featured tweet. state is:   It’s Florida. videos Orange County California city council meetings much same.

A dangerous level crazy ignorance taken hold country. learn live it? 
You make statement got recovered. mean, There's always LEAVING Florida, nothing offer. worker protections tenant protections Florida hot garbage pizza, even compared cheap states. know people stay unless frankly trapped. Politics globally needs fixing. need competent, strong leaders, people play well social media. know illegals committed crime point? Perfect time defund testing sites. Violence begets violence.

Peace goal, ""winning"" Still chronic conditions 180k could turn conservative. ~10 days 800 daily deaths (current rate) brings total ~132k. 
Then happens current infections turn deaths? daily death rate likely climb near previous high 20 days brings us 180k middle August. 
This even taking consideration effect testing delays multiple high infection states. delays likely leading lower infection numbers population. Hopefully make Labor Day fewer 200k dead, looking good based current reactions. CDC guidelines plainly says states re-open unless there's downward trend, certain somebody who's ultimately charge CDC says LIBERATE! state shut down. 

What we're witnessing criminal neglect. Mattis/Fauci 2020 Fuck 35% People don’t want wear masks. Glad hear places taking seriously. process following exactly we're Spain. asthma masks give hella anxiety makes asthma worse, mf bet I’ll still fucking wear one bc don’t want person next possibly exchanging something could kill us family members. Like it’s simple theory action, don’t understand wanna fight hard. know IFR 10% would changed things here. Trump cares economy. Unfortunately law cannot made mandatory. actually federal case law subject unless working lab, mandates wearing X ixnay'd federal courts though never made Supreme Court. put anti govt party power course govt ineffective. effective get elected I’m news 65% people lose income lockdown.... Oh lose faith lot that. thought school worker deliberately coughing 1 year olds face enough today though...what actual fuck wrong people?

Instead, think done something along lines of..... look, going go lockdown give $2,000/mo next 3 months every tax paying American going enforce strict lockdown 3 months. Everyone still pays rent/mortgage, cell phones, cable, water, power bills. money left could saved isnt anything spend money food, medicine. upfront beginning reality situation. would kept money flowing economy people would comfortable knowing bare minimum essentials covered. Landlords still get money, Power/water, wifi companies still get paid people less worried least feel like roof head food fridge.

But instead, kicked road hopes Covid float away gets warm we'll 15 cases summer. coming back bite everyone ass. People work, states going broke able continue pay UI many months landlords banks want money. 

I could completely wrong take April. 
We left house, except groceries since February. wife grew poor, relates staying home time life. agreed lowest risk vacation could imagine, current spikes questioning it. 

 
She insisted renting cabin week July 4th. fair, said cabin kitchen, 20 miles nearest town, agreed, long got cancellation insurance. much things spiking, insurance looks like better better plan. Slovakia went lockdown time Italy. time virus hadn’t spread slovakia much. got contact tracing virus could spiral control. Japan also saw approach trying find clusters trace stop spread.

Sure countries also used masks, thing brought virus. Lockdown contact tracing did. tough path go virus widespread  really strange legal definition understanding agreement decades ago. basically government property certain things state uphold like fire elevator codes. imagine public health orders would among included agreement, that's legal battle.

Disney want imagine they'd close Florida's state government ever gets head ass. Maybe close volition, knows. seems like reality set public consciousness government going protect us meaningful way. one 1200 stimulus check enough. eviction restrictions expire could potentially see mass homelessness. People given trying strategy Americans know do, rugged individualism. one wants one countless impending cases homelessness. grim time America. recently outdoor dinners family first time. felt wrong. I’m still super comfortable either  read study weeks ago researchers bought like 80 cloth masks Etsy, etc. found particulate-filtration ranged 1% 60%.  Damn ton. don’t even eye protection. mask neck gaiter, too. know stylist wear mask wash hands check in. Figured first appointment day may reduce risk. But, hair control. want buzz cut. I’ve never long. Man, brutal. Actions bear fruit two weeks. People already infected hit hospitals increasing numbers even clampndown. didn’t know 0 10. Vietnam almost 100M population. Sounds like lot ""intake/release"" happening days like covid globally... 0.03%, lose faith :-) bet it. 95% people 65 get coronavirus mild symptoms. 5% left run gamut ""Can stay home miserable"" like ""Need ventilator"" like unlucky 21 year old New York category. Hahaha corona cases spike US cases continuesly high level? one knew health care could hard I’d rather save sick time mental health days honestly lol, get actually nothing recover Fire lock Alcatraz. WW One virus, less cell, instructing trillions trillions cells replicate exact virus. Many chances mutate mutations break virus, original virus stays intact keep replicated.

by mutations they're talking virus mutating new strains (like ... parts virus details. training, let's call SARS-CoV-1, 2002/2003 one less harm; SARS-CoV-2-Original, one that's beginning pandemic, developing SARS-CoV-2-Italy, SARS-CoV-2-Bronx, SARS-CoV-2-Sydney, etc..).

In former virii, we've less mobility infected people (they'd stay home/go hospital early generally travel less), virus quick killing host.

As seen, ""this virus"" extremely apt spreading. time even killing host (but 0.5% billion infections still results lots trouble), reducing physical capabilities. Mind: virus care, spreading. leaves host able physically survive long time spreading, good virus. us humans relying physical performance, say truck drivers chronic fatigue, irrelevant virus ;) post didnt age well: Well said blink unless 10%, even 9.9% make blink. culture well. mandatory people insist wear use mask half-heartedly, much change. bullshit. Look, it’s acceptable pissed stupidity people can’t quarantine. It’s acceptable pissed people denial virus. bullshit using worst case scenario means pointing weak everyone else is. There’s mass amounts unemployment, sexual abuse, divorce, suicide, sorts things this. impact people’s lives real, cause act predictably strange ways. People meant undergo type isolation, people it’s breaking usually hit limits. I’ve mostly okay this, even endure tragedies, I’m okay doesn’t mean call everyone weak that’s done this. Must orange county fair balanced. every station covering virus, someone cover heroic gyms barber shops fighting freedoms! Makes sick much money given super wealthy corporations making record profits years. whoops sorry nothing left you, get back work. government cant bothered protect public safety forces citizens choose risking lives becoming homeless completely failed opinion. killing men much women, killing old much young. reflex turn racism misplaced. Blacks tend live urban settings, lower skill social jobs, significant number unhealthy/obese. fit, telecommuter, salad eating Black person good chance fine. can't point specific law regulation 2020, imagining. 

I point one:  irony wearing masks supposed right thing do, people like believe racism everywhere (if everywhere, nowhere), exempting Blacks would end killing Blacks. ironic racism, coming well-meaning Whites. seeing racism everywhere does.

Also, significant majority leaders old, unhealthy, high risk. every incentive lower death rates. They'll fine lockdowns, poor can't get free government money hurting most. group want go back work often can't government dictate. employee company found it. Mandatory 14 days away work cleared come back. Tracing found hung employees outside work without care masks distancing. also received order 14 days work cleared return. tell they're 44 52, people among least likely statistically stroke,"" Dr. Mocco told Post, adding link COVID-19 stroke ""is one clearest profound correlations I've come something virus either makes blood thick causes sort inflammatory response causes stroke young people,” said Dr. Josephson, neurologist JWM Neurology Josephson said seeing people COVID-19 strokes 40s, 30s - **even 20s.** right wing press made much mess, rebelling every stage, lockdowns possible. US. Back Feb... “Whatever Chinese number is, double it”. Pretty sure there's strong correlation among people wear masks, seat belts, helmets. two grandparents, cancer patient Barbosa's parents, 80s.

This end well them. Except Japan basically everything else wrong except masks they're pretty much Sierra Leone quickly adopted masks. Zambia, Venezuela, Slovakia, others around world.

None countries especially known stellar COVID response apart masks. Well can’t really force people refuse something like wearing face masks. [How could possibly No. slammed like badass 9 year old. see Tulsa rally? surprise sure, welcomed one

-Covid-19 100% spot on. However, would push protest spike start 2nd even 3rd week July - level 2 level 3 spread may cause next spike. hope not, it’s metric I’m personally watching see protests really numbers, anything. I'm surprised gaming put something along Sisolak's mandate. It'd really scare casinos enforcing it, considering affect first round regulations had. Remember church claimed air vents could prevent covid?

""On Sunday made post congregation inform everything foster cleanest, safest environment resume church services. heard Coronavirus COVID used interchangeably. **Our statement regarding CleanAir EXP units used word COVID said Coronavirus** COVID surrogates. hope alleviate confusion may caused."" been, prior this, believe He’s actually dip shit. Meaning he’s dip shit, Incase wasn’t clear. 

Enjoy comment it’s removed mods  go well Kappa well majority users american GG America People wanted go beach, walked bunch people wearing masks, spoke someone ""we're goingbto get anyway"" attitude, etc. Oh *NOW* people wear mask authoritarian enabling sellout Judenrat... behind wheel test, wait august??? SD great downtown recently restaurants bars opening... made sense since requires people indoors without masks. tourists coming back aren’t even remotely respecting mask rules anywhere. % death higher hospitals overwhelmed USA! USA! USA! got impression, thanks pointing out. Still sure Disney shut volition though. numbers way COVID way up. There's amount waivers guests sign Disney able shut lawsuits coming way. know Universal getting ready close gates furloughs week. broken clock, right? cleaning subways first month half. Sorry hear happened, hell expect? Well, know younger are, easier deal disease. And, well, considering newborns, let's take optimistic route consider they're sleeping fine. 800 tons coal burned power Titanic every day. Something consider. Congrats America, fantastic keep up. Breh  Honestly much could prevented government support. We’ve one stimulus $1,200, that’s it. course people dicks decided actively worsen extent virus, need fucking work live. I’m even hearing active discussion government support, it’s absurd. I’m still unemployed I’m fortunate expenses relatively low, that’s case everyone though. bad grew hearing this, minus trump part? Also Obama gay since Michelle Obama dude? Jesus Christ man people believe junk deaths lot. comparatively, pretty decent.


But nowhere near slowing down.  final tally counted.  happen know we're timeline wise compared then? Well, boy howdy, who'd thunk it?

Seriously though, way reminds Y2K. working department 1999 saw enormous amount work went making sure nothing bad happened rolled 2000. effort, popular perception became Y2K hoax nothing happened. No, nothing happened many people busted asses, working late nights weekends, make sure it.

It's similar COVID. everyone they're supposed do, making small sacrifices, much happen. everyone get panties twist say fake, realizing reason nothing happened appropriate actions prevented it. Yeah think they're saying through, makes sense that's important thing. agree mostly zero chance actually took HDCQ. Perfection mobile, open menu top right corner, Coronavirus first news category listed. It’s right search US. #Shit, trump better hurry stop testing make coronavirus go away!!!

/s  Fucking arts crafts Karens way much time hands. Everyday hate society bit 30 strains according Iceland study done 2 months ago.

I dont know information suppressed.

Im sure 50 strains plus now.


Whoever thinks 2 strains wrong stuck back February China START OUTBREAK 2 strains. 


This makes think vaccine futile. point. Unless strictly vaccine spike protein would take care theoretically.


Also, PEOPLE STARTED TAKING VITAMIN MAGNESIUM ZINC VITAMIN C, whole pandemic would months literally.


In many countries, LITERALLY GIVINH HEALTHCARE WORKERS DAILY VITAMIN ""TO PREVENT INFECTION""!!!

The world needs wake up! Mortgages paused. Forbearance forgiveness, payments need get paid back one lump sum end forbearance period. horrible message bunch CEO speak. Basically, CEO saying know crap hit fan soon know exact day going rely weak government response requiring masks businesses (which dumb minimum wage employees required security guards enforce enforced) maybe vaccine soon \*shrug\*. Also, maybe people start wearing masks quarantine see lot people dying. thing CEO mass email employees positive messages teamwork caring home office River Oaks guys knee deep sick patients 24 hour shifts. Also, marketing team put festive banners guys heros maybe open budget everyone gets cool TMC branded koozie t-shirt.

Covid unknown hurricane. already studies spread stop momentum-which mass testing quarantining spreaders. already know future based happened China, Italy NYC. specific measures quarantine spreaders mass testing, disease goes unchecked hospitals start rent refrigerated trucks bodies medical teams get stressed max decide lives dies. 

The CEO needs push specific city wide hospital procedures address shortage qualified medical professionals, require testing hospital employees. Also, needs support teams procedures help stress medical teams endure-both physically mentally. wearing maks slap face 120,000 people family friends mourning.

Like come on, suck wear one. Literally nothing bad comes it. forgot “sad” end. I'm working 2 times per week, worth risks. Well bills. Stay safe! Wellcome Spain last March. going rough april. Hawaii highest R0 nation. need get spead control takes away one tools it.

LMAO Tbf Romney's done that. ""R word"" spine vote ""I word"" iirc. No. decision California refused give guidance reopen theme parks (because clearly good idea, SoCal surging right now.) 

Florida care safety anyone, need tourism dollars time feed everyone economy. Disney also wants money give fuck anyone.

Because ""From Disney"" rather state CA itself, would take either Disney Florida suddenly giving shit close WDW. 

I know Florida unlikely grow conscience anytime soon this. given salt Disney's press release big meanie Newsom let reopen CA, doubt they'll take initiative themselves. 140 people one got infected! Possibly. hats larger others. Others smaller others. right size usually pretty significant though. agree? Im back work. work public. coworkers panic attacks quitting. honestly might join them. Good luck there. Stay safe Tbf Romney's done that. ""R word"" spine vote ""I word"" iirc. Change how? Like America's order slow testing? can't count test! I'll first say super uncomfortable especially intense work server underlying disorder. However saying absolutely suffer means less people get sick might potentially keep someone feeling loss loved one dying.

Now Americans worried ""freedom"" ""rights"" willing care themselves. matter anyone tells effects personally continue go parties, wear masks, and/or social distance. got lots dum dums Yup, I’m getting sick seeing playing shocked card honestly. act like fucking idiot global pandemic exactly think going happen?

Now Americans worried ""freedom"" ""rights"" willing care themselves. matter anyone tells effects personally continue go parties, wear masks, and/or social distance. telling 35% want lockdown? prefer death suffering? one re-entering Taiwan overseas? struck incredibly lucky far? Yeah, impression before, India really strict lockdown. theory, everyone government said, would close zero now.

Unfortunately, hear huge number Indians follow rules. perfectly explains numbers keep going up, instead going down. trying three-peat? Dumbasses. Siri: “Searching.... Alexa, nonzero chance mean?”

Do we?

Sounds like giving me. hospitals low cases moved covid patients ICUs regardless condition it’s easier contain. sure common though. Thanks source. Yes, specifically talking need haircut protest. protesting even though told would open weeks wait longer. condolences. really wanted learn masks work would look up. think work wanted someone debate that, unknown reasons. honest. Historically, basically M.O. don’t even teach truth nation founded. Manifest destiny, slavery, Hiroshima, Vietnam, 911. basically try shroud/ignore/reframe truth every fundamental issue we’ve had. Mistakes basically considered “un-American”. 

It’s disgusting, shameful embarrassing way live. Actually idea Karen coming starting ruckus needs mask something look forward to.

I'd happily make viral video. people forecast 60K total. worry, wait long enough virus spread rampantly we'll fools together Thanks source No, asking provided service, like owed something. opinion actually matter all. [I drive time. it’s 5 Yeah, fried chicken awesome.

Static-X sucks Wait - senior trip!?! to?? Tbf viewers ones believe anyway. Northeast CA isn’t?

Or dies run cycles 4 weeks talking resurgence Bronx I’m libertarian conservative haven’t business around groups without mask 3+ months preach masks acquaintances. 

I’m minority around area can’t believe mask wearing become polarized. okay become medium manslaughter. know long get away it. heartless lacking empathy seems continuous thing lot people  Dybala seems fine. scoring goals. course do. want stimulus (aka free paid vacation back). possible close pharmacies grocery stores absolutely essential. stayed open even Spain, Italy, New Zealand. crucial thing testing contract tracing enforcing quarantine infected individuals begin reopening process. Deal new outbreaks swiftly can’t grow. Yes, perfect world mask shortages doubt would law day 1. Several Asian cities come mind. thinking 500K total vaccine. Apparently happens there's negative feedback loop local deaths reach certain rate. point people start believing threat cooperating hotspot arises somewhere else.

But particular local area hotspots 50 miles away, enough local people believe enough cooperative. *all* local areas hit basic rate eventually. people become cooperative get habit cooperating area goes lower level. zero.

If feedback loop would right 600K year end. Idk know quite people who’ve recently announced pregnancies... Entitled what? discussion thread. anything add discussion, don't. I'm asking question. thru photos see people wearing masks model expect death rate trend lower , Hopefully case. Thanks source. would make sense actual case numbers much higher reported/known, exponential growth people infected new people get infected new people end ICU. I.e think there's 100 people infected expect 200-300 new cases next 2 weeks there's actually 200 people infected see 400-600 new cases timeframe(roughly, exponential growth spread modelling complicated I'm using completely made numbers). CARES?! flat surface /s Mine even get sued that. 3 cycles BEP chemo stage 3 mixed seminoma.

I athletic, 30s... covid gave viral meningitis *four months.* I'm able return work time soon. That's thought. watch earlier daily Cuomo pressers, beginning one would take mask. wear speaking generally ok look panel 6+ feet apart. least NY that's rule, wear mask can't maintain safe distance. No. Yeah, think people generally going practicing social distancing wearing masks + protests (to degree) seeing here. Outside protests, people seem generally reluctant wear masks public. 

I say, images protests I’ve seen show lot people wearing masks - far visiting bars restaurants places like old town Scottsdale. think protests contributing numbers, lot community spread people stubborn and/or stupid. 

Our governor FINALLY relented rescinded executive order prohibited individual municipalities enacting mask orders. Maricopa county mandatory mask rules, I’m interested see happens numbers...in two three weeks. 47 million... Labor force something like 165 million before?

47/165 million translates unemployment rate 28%, already exceeding ~25% peak unemployment rate 1933.

Who knows much go net gain jobs. 30%? 40%? Higher?

Of course, rough estimate napkin math (since account things like fact file unemployment hours slashed, still unemployed, people filled claims yet job, etc.). Could quite bit, fact somewhere ballpark numbers concerning. choose wear N95 mask work sign waiver get specific training. Ya it’s still like 3% so. going I’d prefer. choice. 90% day? I'd go find again. think University Michigan study said requiring caused harm good evidence prevented spread caused people neglect social distancing touch faces instead.

If new cases increasing, number deaths generally follow couple weeks later. mean actually infuriating. polarizing everything days, pandemic one events would THINK would come together country over. nope.

We're calling that, they're big face masks room air circulate. cone top air leave mask. Translation 35% Americans idiots selfish (idiots) wondering going spin states others overwhelmed weird bimodal distrobution - fellas seem either suppress acknowledgement mortality/illness, else full man-flu meltdown/tantrum. Never mild cold that's admitted quietly treated bit rest tea, either full blown denial declaration one dying. Nah, still Oceania there's Oceania qualifiers. get half spot play fifth place South American team.  I’m thinking quarter million time elections happening. thinkpeople whinging quarantine conditions deserve ridicule. 

This serious stuff. 

Deal it. Trump threaten countries nukes accept Americans? lol welcome america Geez. hope not. Slow testing please!!!! fewer cases..... 19 bit mean? 5 year old child basic arithmetic could tell hit 10 million. stopped serving purpose years ago. need replaced proper health organisation paid Chinese government. didn’t panic told drink bleach inject sunshine

Yep, made voting November much critical part CA well, select counties simply followed directives - Orange County big one. global pandemic growth exponential, linear, really fuck things rest us.

Speaking anecdotally, also think may lot people secretly breaking lockdown hang people's houses too. That's I've seeing IG stories, little bewildering. That’s mom keeps telling pretty dead first one thing is, deadly skin rash example would probably seen acceptable risk, given far greater percentage people would die covid get rash. medical conditions. Exacerbated heat. It’s called need breathe. #Blame trump. always wondered got people **willingly** drink poison Kool-Aid

[Most drank kool-aid Everybody drank it. drink it, forced drink it. ran, thought we'd shot. Yea maybe clarify - getting food going store, I’ve seen pretty strong responses. walking around block, obviously much much less. Except med get 75% sick get herd immunity. med keep number infections low possible vaccine deployed. talk ""well everyone's going get antsy"" fuels resistance madks preventative measures. wait everyone gets this. med slow much possible vaccinate. there's readon assume get ""herd immunity"" know getting sick gives lasting immunity. time get 80% people caught it,the earliest people could lost immunity.

I know mean well pushing false narrative, everyone needs get stop it. unscientific dangerous begging repeat assumption fact. prevent outcome. Username checks Winnie Pooh. USA!!!! USA!!!!!!!! USA!!!!!!! USA!!!!! tired cooped up. Theyre actively disobeying safety protocol Joo Dee? BLM protests ended mystique covid left. soon hcps we’re saying protests great, go it, attitude changed everyone else. Put high school gym, everyone would still watch lol wish anybody die, family either learn hard lesson life change ways nobody die it'll reinforce faith God narrative Coronavirus bad. never know China's true numbers. amount emergency prep concealed WH got real high. Good hear. Perhaps enclave sort? Im east bay. Compliance fifty percent. Joggers dont use them. Basketball games young adults wearing them. really tossup area whether person walking towards wearing one not. Like miracle! need Kenneth Copeland blow ... work first time :). Can't alcoholics drink home like rest us? Absolutely not. Hospital workers higher risk critical protect people like grocery store employees delivery drivers. Essential workers line right behind medical staff elderly, ahead rest population. crystal ball tell that? Lastly, need remember COVID 19 new disease, world population little immunity it, almost everyone susceptible it. Hence, need high ratio people immune order halt infection.  


That formula going end lot damage. gross oversimplification useful teaching undergrads concept herd immunity, anywhere near accurate enough used basis global pandemic strategy.

Susceptibility binary. either ""susceptible"" ""immune."" continuum varying levels resistance. People strong immune systems good health less susceptible people without. Children definitely proven less susceptible, infected lower rates even households known cases adults identical living conditions infected.  Certain blood types proven less susceptible others. proven there's cross-immunity coronaviruses, hinted suggestively lot study results. course lifestyle number social contacts influences odds infected.  


It's reasonable say level prevalence inside society would cause virus become unable spread naturally probably sufficiently high attempting achieve number would likely disastrous decision. need continue fight disease prevention improved care every axis find.

But trying put percentage involves make many oversimplifying assumptions resemblance number gets actual answer probably lucky coincidence. Trump people bad estimating crowd size? I’m sure asked multiple times day - badly need haircut. I’m taking COVID seriously. wear mask, haven’t seen anyone since started, etc. worst all, I’m stuck South Carolina. However...I’m starting get really uncomfortable. hair longer it’s ever been, it’s 90 degrees, it’s itchy I’m used (yes, shower). barber’s current rules everyone wear mask, can’t come it’s scheduled time, wash hands coming in. So...is enough? I’m taking precaution, huge risk? scheduled appointment 29th 9am. First appointment day one barber. I’m tremendously afraid. don’t want one single time go give this. I’m sure strong immune system - asthma gotten really annoying year. I’m uncomfortable. anyone tell flat out, yes no. explain help choose. don’t want take risk, annoying. hate afraid things planet support 50 - 100 billion people, live way conductive go that. Like efficient farming, dramatically lower meat consumption western nations, better use renewable power sources conservation energy. probably push well beyond geo-engineering, really need.

You're absolutely right, agree completely. perhaps differ you, ever see happening. way, believe, globe overpopulated. 

As possible solutions, would depend definition ""damage,"" suppose. I'm support temporarily limiting reproduction, men women, completely disallowing without first meeting certain requirements, one would expect allowed adopt (in idea perfect world, is). encourage spaying neutering animals help control population; see reason humans excepted species principle. eye want. going anywhere possibly get infected infect them. like replied way live virus by, know, handling situation rational way. say rational else supposed pandemic worse? Bury heads sand pretend doesn’t exist? hope affects someone else yourself? 

I’m beginning realize America suffers toxic neglect aspects society. treat shameful. ignore plight women, people color, disabled, uneducated, sick, overworked, homeless even prisoners. downplay ill effects society affects us world ignoring root causes. We’re people deserve dignity, it’s cooperation get this. Maybe look inward affect real change. Sorry rant need get chest. pandemic given time think bigger picture. Well, asked swing voter . . . rocket science. long guy says it, choose believe lie five lights, Even belief costs anyone else lives. straight forward. Obviously get point, balance risks. down-vote me, everything entails balance risks. Else every hospital would MRI scanner state art ED. heard wife ugly also? catch 22 one hand great Dumb old Republican Fox news watchers die virus hand spread people take seriously. Imagine killing grandparents cough ignored... 

It’s months fear factor gone. People becoming way complacent it’s good. Missing mortgage / rent payments pretty fun. go round 2 level foreclosures evictions? thousands medical professionals claiming protests A-Okay way diminish covid minds people Fox could ever hope do. soon Doctors experts said biggie, obliterated fear Nice try 😂 Well meant everything exists scale, one die anything need go extreme everything. coronavirus think mistakes made Sweden it’s bad people sub try pretend is.
It worst flue season 20 years Sweden, 20 years ago one made big deal Sweden reacted. Every quarantined bored crybaby kiss essential overworked underpaid ass! Worldwide US? much hand sanitizer(on hands!) causes alchohol poisoning

Lots young migrant workers, fewer elderly percent population. Every woman rethinking kids, given disasters they're going face climate change inevitably progresses chaos. 

Today's children asking parents ""you KNEW? anything? brought world anyway?"" 

The world can't get shit together fight Covid keep people perishing, lack all-encompassing, globalized response climate change nowhere horizon either. anything, think talk needing N95 professional-grade masks may counter-productive may led believe worth wearing simple cloth bandana nothing else. article supports too. portrayed Kelso idiot Wisconsinite 70s Show, thought satire fact SME businesses, even large businesses, go business lockdown prolonged. example, Gym bosses getting angry hairdressers pubs getting limited opening July 4th, going scientific advice.

Good thinking! Thank captain fucking obvious course not, reality facts bother kind people blame blm? yeah that’s he’s doing.

/s approximation available many cases could world total, besides official tested ones? Vast majority cases likely going unnoticed, don’t clue big portion undetected cases could be. Definitely. husband keeps trying convince get try getting pregnant now. already toddler 2 couple months, speech delayed. that's another reason want another. 

My husband bit agitated thinks tried getting pregnant right son I'll 30 end year. son born definitely PPD while, still bit sometimes. want hop another pregnancy.

This obviously related simple competence people serology surveys. see issue they. would think address thing test itself. 

My point tests would systematic errors, return results say levels similar. real, real, infected 18 people family.. take seriously, willing risk infecting 18 people single family stupid birthday party. think I’m gonna stick actual statistics one.

There three kinds lies: lies, damned lies, statistics.

Have fun that, motherfucker! RemindMe! 30 days far uneducated person I’ve ever encountered Reddit. truly unbelievable stupidity made question intelligence. 

You somehow turned argument young people high risk stroke Covid people 52-69 young people. astonishing. Pfft... no, that's sacrifice worth doing. lockdown protests, protection. Hell perform transfusion presidential limo. surprised could full heart surgery White House, case. Methodical approach reopening working wonders Michigan, summer great far arriving death rate low? Based purely CDC numbers, 125k dead 2.5m cases (roughly) 5%. Granted, may under-reporting numbers, 5% pretty high. you’re thinking 125k 330m, logic wrong. thought sure would Jeb v. Rubio major story. Trump came along activated trap card ""incite racism"". here... I’m due September (so got pregnant pandemic thing) I’m getting frustrated people wearing masks. obviously plan pregnant pandemic, deal people’s stupidity putting unborn baby’s life danger top dealing pregnancy. Ahh..hyde park oak brook :) Lubbock also per capita leader churches don’t get issue Americans wearing masks. country wear masks [i]and[/i] gloves. wear masks. What’s big deal?? That’s part confused “Oh it’s COVID, work construction it’s probably mesothelioma, nothing worth seeing doctor for” Triple experts say... Time stop counting, guys! here. really sure, know chosen ago though (likely least 3-4 wks ago) probably correlated around beginning reopening thus lot uncertainty. booking large venue large metro Phoenix (6 million+) might decided (vs. lot out-of-towners Tulsa pop 400k?). dont care playing show. people party top skyscraper Independence Day. Can’t bad second wave first one never ends! like liability dodging saving bucks maintenance. Welp... Trump rally’s... concert.

(Please know, think rally’s concerts pandemic ignorant irresponsible.) local bars I've observed. masks, even though bars removed half stools, people grab chairs tables. Nobody enforcing stuff. 

I restaurant, throughout dinner people came went bar, nobody wiping sanitizing. definitely anything cleaning bar stools.

The outrage I've seen people (including tons bartenders servers) reacting order nuts.  🏅🏅🏅 go champ!

Edit spelling Good boy equipped transfusion right oval. Whats edited? last two posts clearly show signs edited. I.E. (last edited x time ago.)

You like called factually mathematically wrong, clue norms stroke prevalence are. That's okay.

I'll keep track try spread bullshit around here, ready correct facts, debunk erroneous arguments advance... since answer next thing post want topic younger ages shown strokes.

I've already demonstrated 50% stroke cohort least decade younger.

Admit wrong we'll continue. New York times removed paywall Corona related content, try opening browser. reason open directly Reddit app still sometimes too. Took 7 days AZ Death count wrong - get hit car, die way hospital get corona, thats counted corona death. 

&amp;#x200B;

[George Floyd counted coronavirus death. killed him?   Conveniently want bodies cremated asap even collecting samples lot doctors (and successful people) false assumption smart one area knowledge smart areas knowledge. doctors idiots comes politics personal finance. People willing kill maim others music missed point. impression party power since independence. Despite elections.

And impression wrong. party amazing charismatic leader (Lee Kuan Yew) better part 30 years. difficult election continuously win. People happy let continue opposition (aka political party) become token existence. 

That leader since passed successor equivalent... opposition active massive lack experience, current feel good factor ruling party done. rather unlikely they'll take time soon. again, current US president. One never say never. Devin Nunes process server wants know location. high court ordered govt test deaths..and govt appealed supreme court... level hiding faking... dirt poor 80% India even counted.. ""my side?"" I'm even American. I'm one countries able keep dick pants long enough get virus control. is, like, pretty much except yours. Since beginning scientific polling, incumbent one point sub-40 approval rating Election year.

So far.... Yeah, pretty sure beginning would baby boom. uncertain times, people likely use birth control. less.

Can imagine idiots actually responsible something? would tacticool-gasm intense would visible across country half would dead end rehearsals training.

Also somehow two trucks would fire Tiny would jail again. Nothing. exactly nothing. haven't. understand grocery store employees need prioritized, frontline health care workers highest risk needed care people get sick. Plaque inc. headlines.... Source pls major vaccine hopes already manufactured already able roll quicker mean. We're already 124k deaths.

50k millions infected americans doesnt seem like far mobile, first try took scrolling (25+ stories) find story mentioning coronavirus. Second try one first ten stories, Grim Milestone one. checks within minutes, algorithm clearly random element.

Every headline BLM rioters. They're prioritizing stories audience care coronavirus. understand hate doomsday person. I'm certain people tried spread ashes loved ones park grounds. become lot less scientific. Mostly political coronavirous news, much less actual virus, transmission, potential treatments, etc. obesity epidemic accounts estimated 300,000 fatalities per year. 

Add corona top gotta 400-500k sure? Mexico death rate sadly super high, 12%.

I think people India healthy here, general. ignorance inexcusable. 

I survived covid. included four months meningitis. I'm still well enough return work. Fuck anyone holds concert right now.

I've cut lot ignorant people life can't. can't. Seeing people blow gamble others' lives *for nothing* triggers me. Occasionally something horrific enough win Conservative Month. surprising stumble barely onto correct side ""decent"", we'd like congratulate Marco Rubio faint honor!

I've wearing one months! reason anyone politicians *this guy's party* telling too. Fuck idiot everyone like him. Studies don’t materialize thin air, especially it’s outside lab everything controlled. Let explain best 1 AM.

First, they’re expensive funding slashed maliciously necessity depending field. data would need answer key questions masks likely already exist, gathering take lot money, planning, time shit already hit fan, economy taking nose dive, research institutions universities financially uncertain futures.

Second, context study matters can’t treat people like lab rats control every detail environment (and good reasons). ask volunteers join study expect valid results, would way randomly sort people control treatment group, one wears masks doesn’t (as example). Besides super unethical, enforcing would 1) impossible, 2) intentionally jeopardize lives. freedom people sort change behaviors, less likely capture anything meaningful data. produce numbers, sure, won’t mean anything.

Many studies happen retroactively, YEARS later, I’m sure hot topic foe data come out. Natural experiments would good examples this, places context outbreak 1) surprised people behavior change event, 2) reliable, high-quality data already gathered reason. It’s needle haystack.

With much COVID-19 data absolute crap (too little testing, reporting inconsistencies, misclassifying causes death, etc.), solid strategy wait compare deaths pandemic years after, already former. knowing many died estimating misleading numbers isn’t useful addressing form prevention own. 

And even you, whatever reason, found needle haystack managed conduct kind analysis worth damn, peer-review process edit ATTEMPT publish work (if makes through) would take long time. got pregnant day first submitted manuscript/research concluded study, it’s possible baby sleeping home learn research published. 

Now better hope someone 1) access journal published in, 2) gets attention, 3) remains relevant useful despite much time passed.

So far human behavior concerned, it’s hard lab rats likelihood. Research already exist, quality varies may relevant specific people, like Americans, context populations different. Scientists estimate experimenting lab animals simulate wearing masks, etc., actually capturing impact human response much, much harder.

Alright There's disparity proven positive untested cases. I'm sure India loads simply cannot test. trust word china numbers ( anything else matter ), need head examination. Can’t read article without creating account, thanks sharing though People answer polls expect pollsters want hear. Yuh DOiiiiii Fuck mod case could large ramifications. Justice Department wins, means state could impose mandatory quarantine? haven’t done much research it, always hear health officials recommending wash hands constantly. constantly touch surfaces hands. you’re saying it’s true, it’s mean don’t wash hands either, recommendations health officials wash hands base usa selfishly hijacked subreddit. Shows egoistic are. 

You’re pretty gross. would fit America great. Sure 60 much higher death rate, much lower comparitivly. change overall death rate though it? 

Worldometers estimates using antibody testing adjust. doubted people said people wouldnt feel safe returning restaurants bars would much less. Americans forget fast. absolutely doesnt surprise me. Maybe go fuck yourself!! ;) Maybe way slowly drag reasonable behaviour. Like training dog give treats something decent try get bad behaviour out. Saying ""happened"" America misleading. This, irrational defiance cloaked sort bizarre patriotism/exercise personal rights, manufactured intentionally. ""done"" America. 

This done America politicians care polls lives. guidelines disclaimer avoid liability, nobody follows know it. You’re risk somebody else wearing mask even you’re wearing one. can’t force everybody wear mask keep on. Temperature screening also largely useless spreading occurs people don’t know it.

Dear people, know vaccine. surely remain inside homes go extremely required. Also, please ALWAYS put masks going out. reduce chances getting COVID19, effectively helping reducing rate growth. I’m state democratic governor. open. decreasing. don’t care friend discussed? relevant. I’ve this. survived. I’m fine.  is. Gets forget listen everytime.  CDC claimed IFR .26%. Blame government.

Idiot think I’ll wait bit... joke. levels infection skyrocketing states, wasting country-wide Lockdown. 

But yet, people still cry ""but freedom!"" talking mandating masks. people merely insecure think they're admitting weak wear them. Sad thing reality quite opposite. strong secure ones wearing masks. week results largest antibody study far published Spain. Spanish study, took blood samples nearly 70,000 people tested SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, suggests around 5% Spain infected, figure 10 times higher 0.5% based official number people testing positive RT-PCR 5% Spain’s population around 2,350,000 people. deaths 27,400 study suggests IFR 1.2%, figure far lower WHO’s early Same. cases rising exponentially. surprises consistent ratio killers are. would think things like influenza would flare down.

Yes, I'm sure handing fines like candy Halloween anger communities all. can’t figure people live there. environmental standpoint abomination. think power scale numbers every time report like 14th 5 power something assume paying attention. perhaps looking different things. instead assuming ask.


In current environment USA, think would good idea send cops enforce mask law? dont want wear face mask, dont go out. Simple that. serious bull people make excuses pandemic. shows care themselves. I'll bet you. Boo thug mous. Bad cartoony. Less quantity. Yay Kelix Khe Kat. Lol okay. People argue borders states can't completely closed, stop flights state. use police officers (apparently) unable stop hurting civilians nice individuals ones working border checkpoints. actually limit people coming back forth ones essential jobs. Nobody has, Fauci. call novel coronavirus.

Does guy actually anymore state obvious? Wanna bet? cover ""Hurt"" amazing. one interconnected countries globe California increasing cases disheartening 

We distancing almost 4 months kids school find quite remarkable (in bad way) many deniers hoaxers still remain. cure get sick watch someone close them. Even broken clock right twice day. Isn’t goes? fucking Surgeon General literally told us masks useless save healthcare professionals cloth masks wold worked fine save N95 masks healthcare professionals.

The blaming public thing bullshit anyhow, clear start examining it. like hospitals going fucking CVS get PPE. million things could done secure PPE hospitals directly earlier supply chain. 

I think whole ""err uhh said want guys hoard like TP"" thing backpedaling, initially wanted keep narrative big deal, business usual, want people wearing masks. 2 cents. Meanwhile, FOXNEWS (the watched cable ""news"" outlet) even mention Corona Virus page 1 2 homepage. They're fuckin' prob. Smug fucks. another point contention incorrect. Sorry.

Trumps major domestic achievement jobs economic growth. virus would stop cold. denying bought time maintain facade. truth eventually rained re-election parade. hope so. It'll lot better place lot fewer idiots around. 1. Outrage tv station pushing delay elections prop false government. 

The commentary politics unnecessary part outrageous. Need elections maintaining high social distancing hygiene standards. Plenty time creating greater number polling stations spreading election hours possibly several days voting. rhetoric pure racism indigenous majority likely reclaim executive power ever election. 

2. Otherwise - Agree needs shown. People taking seriously also people risking lives they’re living pay pay. 

3. finally, wish US balls show something like tv. 

Feel bad family, think death good tv people understand, another quiet number. 

I wish would show 1 Florida — someone’s parent dying due 30 40 year olds going summer vacation lazy river water park. might change things.  dont think heartless, anyways best luck try decide too. hoping find answer got clap comments. Apparently, nobody else finished it. Going Google Rick rolled kill time now. There's 30 - 35% number popping again. may true. according data, percentages cases young people consistently increasing. I'm favor everyone staying home. massive impacts us financially, I'd rather get financial trouble die require lung transplant years. heaven forbid mandate masks nation-wide infringe people's rights (the ones care convenient them). poetic justice Michigan one strictest virus whole way through. People actually protested going governors office guns. result measures, one lowest cases totals per capita. It’s almost like science tells good idea. Actually California postponing opening Disneyland, theme parks.  Seeing Disney World still slated open, I'm sure Disneyland would carried on. report restaurant employee wash hands leaving bathroom. report one employees patrons exhibit behaviors 300x likely kill dirty hands.
Leave Google Yelp review. Call healthcode violation. Use key words like ""unclean"" ""unsanitary"" ""grimy"". also means everyone least cushion rely regards basic needs met. Food/Gas/Phone/Utilities cases even rent. Imagine stress relief would hundreds millions people never worry ""what lose absolutely everything?"" anymore.

Could imagine much could progress nation without sword damocles hanging heads? know anybody would UBI done reasonable manner. Rookie numbers. Hahah we’ll still come bunker  mean die things corona virus* Ummm no. Try NYC starters. Massive BLM protests! He's real Dick, know. getting exponential India beyond imagination. People roam like careless beings realize going unless really necessary wearing masks necessary go out, keys keep oneself safe flurry. numbers going drop much unless effective medicine vaccine developed. So, then, keep safe. Unfortunately Bidets work Coronavirus should. Thoughts prayers 🙏 orange Pol Pot decrease testing testing causes covid. recently cut funding EcoHealth, US company US scientists work bsl4 lab Wuhan together scientists. working together surveillance- going out, catching bats, checking new Coronaviruses risk spillover (capable infecting humans), trying develop vaccines/therapeutics work viruses ready day comes wer need them. field work happen China that's bats live.  

Now cut funding....right now, read this, freezer China that's filled hundreds different species novel coronaviruses varying levels ability infect humans, **that US scientists longer work on**. Specimens tax dollars paid put scientists there, dressed expensive BSL3 gear, explore caves gather bats/bat guano years.

3.) Mask wearing reduces transmission COVID-19 public places

Peer reviewed inherently insurmountable problem. makes quite difficult virus new many papers peer reviewed -- yet. 

But would construct **experiment** **public** **public setting** using **deadly** Covid-19 virus? impossible ethically construct. 

You demanded impossible. irony course, image, people wearing masks. ok lets look probability perspective instead statistical perspective

I losing patience idiots. causing society harm. hope everyone keeping track idiots social circles hammer fools mercilessly things get worse.

They need know suffering selfish asses. already give we're paying it. 3...2...1...and....yep, there's next panic attack. clear though (or sold us being) case count rising flattening curve hospitalizations/deaths. case count rising places may mean health system overloaded. I'm suggesting eliminate mitigation measures reverting back ""lockdown"" significant downstream effects make sure actually warranted. seeing many hospitals across country overwhelmed moment may function younger, healthier people making new cases. Thus, new cases today may inherently different new cases months ago mostly really sick people tested hospitals. Lastly, another point consider learning treat deal Covid patients better lessen need strict lockdown measures. Homemade ones HEPA vacuum bags using like furnace filter inset two layers cloth miles ahead T-shirt bandana. good N95 still effective. Wow didn’t realize 2.4 million people those. Stop peddling fear little guy. revese discrimination? Spike? gone since spiked 2 month ago. 30,000 cases day everyday. guys locked now! I'd love Texas that, nope. Oh fuck me. Floridian resident physician checking in. fellow interns tested negative covid thus cleared start work next Wednesday. Thoughts n prayers plz matter?

If people getting sick colds flu expect positive tests increase?

Even test 100% positive 5 cases many getting sick better testing 10,000 getting 1% positive.  many people complying? really type this? Take step back examine lack logic post. parents live TX showing videos proud line food social distancing. can’t stand them. Yeah blame must do. people would wear stupid masks wash hands things would lot better us. Easter though. mathematical knowledge. least counties worse percentages - Maricopa Harris.

Bullshit fuck outta Base traffic etc totally agree. People social distancing well That’s announce predictable long term income solution people know coming free spend things. Getting debt actually good economy though money made spent easily debt gone. It’s don’t want lot student loan debt there, slows spending group needed degree make better money want economy. Im going doctors two days first time.  Ive extremely unhealthy due stress, anxiety disorder crohns flare up.  Even though im normally great health, 170 pounds, 6 ft play sports year round.

The lockdown probably saved life.  weigh 145 pounds now.  Lost 25 pounds since march... Stress , anxiety crohns easy... 

Im worried someone behind bills people dying fear dying.  work home now. Many jobs stay open pandemic.  dont mind people working lockdown wear mask follow safety rules.  second lockdown needs focus unnecessary gatherings. Restaurants bars need indoor seating closed vaccine available.  mask way.... Idiocracy part 2, revenge Karens Oh, hasn’t “debunked” lol. matters incidents like that, among others, don’t anything help China’s reputation honest what’s really happening. Supporters current American “leadership” sees demographics dying Covid-19 fine it. dont americans. masks take freedom away! [Here statistics place couple states Lincoln County officials smoking weed, trying commit genocide Onion buy CBS? what's going today, doubt even voice matters much. California masks mandatory, people still care. best, public lip service.  saw /s
I won’t lie, got first! Even better!! Thank you! think 65% go back lockdown own. issue peoples jobs/incomes. say was. What's percent positive? like outstanding 40% before. know Reddit loves &lt;insert fucked, Brazil actually might be. Jesus. SMH. taxed tax rate income bracket like income. considered income taxed yet.

If higher tax bracket gonna get taxed examples bottom lay well. Oh get it, way see PoC self demeaning.
 
It's another label makes separate group. 6k new cases day... move along, nothing see here! literally gym opened city I'd happy like rest foreseeable future lol. I'll probably start missing real concerts next year, free online streams holding now. ""Faust, also emergency room doctor Brigham Women’s Hospital Boston, said “silver bullet” preventing infection Covid-19. stressed importance wearing face mask keeping capacity restrictions effect public places."" Make people blue collar jobs fill polls results different.

Ofcourse person white collar job doesnt mind lockdown doesnt effect person. Yepppp. I’m expecting anyone subject matter expert stuff. basic knowledge... think that’d drastically change response whole thing :/ People lost jobs got hit COVID medical bill hospital could use money bills. doesn’t sound selfish all, sounds like healthy self-preservation concern wellbeing. It’s exactly you’d expect — protection, hens hire, smuggling illegal birdseed. get paid crackers, it’s tough way make living. Trump blowing lead massive choke, like guy inherits millions yet finds way go bankrupt casino business.. oh wait.. Real breaking news this.  think short, localized shut downs happen. guess rollbacks openings anything. Hopefully surge get people take little seriously get situation Europe in. Somehow France went ""just fucked are"" 30 new cases day. feel like everyone required wear face mask people arent going cause racial issue around person color wearing face mask. dumbest rule I've ever seen. racially discriminatory make one race wear face masks others not. I'm white supremacist anything feel like ig wearing face mask needed slow spread covid everyone one. doesnt matter race pick, picking one race something different another race racially discriminatory dumb repeated points folks back. ""They say wearing masks right now, I'm going wear mask. wear mask too"" Nope, behavior affects others' health. Part personal responsibility responsible *towards* people society. Trump's America. going gets tough, sacrifice order look one another.....we bury heads sand pretend nothing wrong.  Exactly. borderline narcissistic  Carter high-key underrated. quite bit preserve economy wasted push reopen quickly. 

This serious depression lack leadership. People brainwashed believe need move out, college debt, live apartment. feel embarrassed live home even though financially responsible. west go VA, worse people wearing masks. fair (at least area I'm in) really bad far spreading It’s race bottom. averaging 1,500 deaths per day 

We are?

I'm pretty sure people start die current infection spike, dont know seeing 1500 oer day average time dont see one...  California like word  letting anyone business without mask, dont care color struggles going through. Mask fuck off! reserve right refuse service anyone reason. Thing point view essentially saying ""FU"" everyone around want get sick, especially immune compromised interact frequently. way see past projections. I’ve wondered early projections mapped data  basically saying mask-wearing scientific.....aka, zero science showing wearing masks stops slows transmission virus public. massive shit-show thrown someone claims know they're talking -- we, sheeple, supposed believe even though zero science proving benefit whatsoever.  I'm amazed thousands people forum snowed bullshit. never provided substantiated evidence got China. could likely got quarantine facility Vietnam. president doctor, he's business man. better worse, Trump views job keeping economy crashing. people voted him. good thing pandemic? Nope. platform ran sticking (probably great idea, things considered). are.

I wear mask go public. I’ve working whole time commute best ever since lockdowns. it’s killing economy peoples lives financially. handing money relief isn’t answer. We’ve flattened curve part except areas goal lockdowns defeat virus. Don’t think go back lockdown hard point. One ways stop racism quit making everything race. as, media says ""cop shoots black man"", first usually mention cops race atleast half article racist. articles read ""cop shoots man"". mean hard understand either Americans, not. need get rid race statistics, known nationality are. I'm citizen Mexico, well I'm Mexican. I'm citizen America i'm American. one. (It doesn’t always either. seems random). Cases going states open quickly.

Protest states going seems.

Some states also seems less social distancing masks...

Virus shown spread indoor close contact. back work could risky outdoor protests. Here! here! Yeah mean, they're talking lots young people transmitting disease, lots young people live alone can't really self-isolate. need build time quarantine infect everyone live with, people get past infectious. took like 2 months northeast. alright, can't say see coming. gonna now? Throw money hope goes away?  We're 6 months thing, give time come around common sense. one thing saw awful lot protests? Masks Since OK mass surveil people’s movement based cell phone data? FWIW, brother high school said friends pretty much hanging like normal now, trying stay outside keep groups small can. doubt they're masks distancing though. sure applicable high schoolers across country I'm sure uncommon. least they're old enough go bars. confident never vaccine. shared evidence hundreds thousands researchers actively working developing one—you could save lot time. 39000 atm could figure way get UV light body, either skin way ... nobody talk California? It’s also setting new records almost every day. /r/LeopardsAteMyFace Thanks kind words. Houston alot take population large spread out. given time road, surrounded 40,000 new friends seems.

We Houstonians tend inviting people hope heat stop enjoying city. heat unruly August, everyone smiling reason. 

Thanks kind words, know persevere im worried cost id rather click block user Yes — masks :/

This going get bad. Real bad. Say louder people downvoting defending China saying don’t fabricate data worse countries I’m talking specifically entire country shutting one time rather based case numbers certain regions. make people tire mitigation measures weren’t necessary regions. I’m saying wrong thing time based knew, think hindsight poor strategy.

And things like Whitmer telling constituents couldn’t visit second homes husband calling getting boat launched weekend. true. school Paris attend, made first month half term online. wonder change whole term. Also private university I’m sure expect Thanks kind words. Houston alot take population large spread out. given time road, surrounded 40,000 new friends seems.

We Houstonians tend inviting people hope heat stop enjoying city. heat unruly August, everyone smiling reason. 

Thanks kind words, know persevere im worried cost People go work? I've gone every day ""lockdown."" looking kidney failure lung damage?

That real concern lies vast majority people. highly contagious. Regardless source record, bad outcome. local news like Texas? panic minimal fanfare? Well would never work, 35% would rather coronavirus cases spike wear mask. Agreed. see people covering nose that's ridiculous. Even bus enforcing rule that's place since April. Lmao case anyone wondering see comment, /u/lifesagamegirl anti-vax, anti-mask, conspiracy theorist Arizona.  

Sad come state raised people stupid this. ""manufacturers"" get stock China fast enough air cargo market exploded. Yeah, hard read. Literally hard read. I'm still entirely sure got sick first how, really care. Wear mask, wash hands, distance. Idaho. Speaking guy city numbers growing rapidly large cities, I’m biased. You’re crazy. You’re right thing.

My wife venture occasional drive thru meal, grocery pickup. see retail stores full be. see restaurants full be. see traffic suggests people going maybe be.

For us, there’s much risk going out, frankly, don’t trust anyone right thing anymore. Masking up, washing hands, keeping distance, etc. work assumption majority people stopped caring, going 100% well.

I’ll acknowledge lucky. I’m working home, job secure. wife self employed afford stay shut down; get fine pay. know it’s everyone. know folks go keep afloat, respect that. 

But no, you’re crazy. You’re think right everyone else. 🙂 Things may ever back normal, pre-covid. example many businesses adapt work home get real estate business. alone send economic ripples multiple industries. Car rental, hotels, airlines, list goes on. Less commuters could really hurt local municipal revenue (no speeding tickets, parking tickets, payroll tax, sales tax.) could quickly lead nasty things like parks libraries closing, reductions police firefighters, defaults pension programs.

Fast food could crash due lack lunch hour revenue, loss rush hour revenue, etc.

Stadiums packed full people, concerts packed full people, may never return pre-covid levels.

We may donning masks public spaces long COVID departed lives. flu season wouldn’t still wear mask example? Google blm protest covid... nuke planet good measure

nah, states. orbit... That's one knows covid-19 Trump. Legal/crime consulting scene. one wanted strangers across country visiting them. majority people see wearing masks look 40 Ex-Army general responsible many wars doctor? Less 24 hours ago another article said hospitals 90% capacity would take two weeks exceed capacity. 4 deaths away matching last Wednesday. Yesterday, exceeded total previous tuesday. May exactly seeing death surge yet, downward trend stopped. Go away. mess Corona. Corona messes you. Individually maybe no. exponential power shared fandom? Maybe? Lol might want read whole article. “CECC Spokesman Chuang Jen-hsiang (莊人祥) added Taiwan contact Japanese officials determine whether test result false positive.”

And way supports claim case Vietnam got China “debunked”. they?  US big. Northeast sees massive spikes again, would second wave.

The south experiencing first wave. Australia same! One primary goals propaganda dissemination miss information. putting doubt everything question trust nothing. America receiving end one successful sophisticated propaganda campaigns ever. results front you, real time.  Wow, that's smartest things he's said years. hasn’t gone missing, wealthy tax evasion unit IRS bet they’d find exactly went. put IFR 0.7% line studies areas. Option 3 Caveat: extrapolating data single county (King County since 1-March).

~6% test positive die. 

If 33,000 people saved dying, 555,000 people saved testing positive. real headline (I’m sure extrapolation margin error, would still 100,000 people testing positive even conservative estimate). back early/mid-March fewer 2,000 cases entire nation

You least 10x number confirmed cases early-March get reasonable estimate true number cases. Maybe even far 100x. words, late avoid NYC situation Houston. Yeah man, something.

Other lockdown measures already proved work.

And testing tracing methods rest world proving works.

Or wearing masks like last 150 years medical science proved works.

If something could do. Taxed 10%, becomes $540. Bangkok second home really hope situation somewhat normalize soon. so, many people whose income heavily relies tourism social system strong enough support them. There's increase suicides, especially poor people absolutely devastating see. Came say Okay fuck uploaded?? I've never voted one things feel like % would alot higher knew posted Also, long, long time dropping, 7-day deaths rolling average gone two days row. left house since Feb. FeelsGamerModeMan.

Everybody forgets conveniently said bs emails again. first thought went head saw was: “yeah trump probably won.” Return lockdown?

If cases spike?

You never went kind hard lockdown cases barely dropped first peak, lol. really consider known characteristics virus well observed possible clinical outcomes, pathogen deserves serious respect. No, fear, respect done - options future awful potential.
I worry six months.
I sure Fauci boat.

The dillusional thinking American society astonishing. Ah failed experiment , gotcha went check literally one button. expected fill bunch info nope. reason never clicked button saw comments Reddit easy accident checking site. - think simplistic argument trumped simplistic, win-all Death Card? cry it, saddlebags! think maybe that’s considered top level entertainment Wisconsin. worth noting excess deaths still low estimate, lockdown car related deaths surprised virus cases(flu etc) due lockdown. ain't kidding. goes ways. pointless. Vacation? serious? message White House. reiterated wasn’t Monday. Meanwhile big religious congregation. sued highest court land allowed it
PS - Failed law school Everyone make intelligent decisions Corona approves that.... care says 2 months ago said nothing. mean shell neck right? back square one let politics guide decisions. 
 
Assuming lock again, fast. seem like something assume. that’s happening. People pretending doesn’t exist. appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message*  Oh good. Thank convincing scientific facts face 12 kids 6 staff getting infected child care center. would allowed serve outdoors. also would expanded current outdoor seating restaurants already partially reopened sit-down service.

Gyms dumb anything outdoors fine. Let bars restaurants serve people outdoors. Let people go back work. Give people reason go spend money local economy. blows mind amount ""Doctors"" coming videos interviews saying masks pointless make risk different illnesses. Wearing fucking mask go grocery store proving much ""the greatest country world"". disgraceful frauds. Probably trump rally If? happening.

Honestly, blame falls federal government book. Proper action could eased people's financial concerns lockdowns. 

 Also, lack assistance states many reopen early. Many states unemployment running out. already bad, people unemployment checks started bouncing would gotten way worse. california resident, I'm starting worry. hospitalizations test positivity rates starting creep up. Share hospital ICU Beds use still low, see TX AZ change hurry. K RemindMe! 30 days guess testing needs reduced further? lol mess. too. Thank you.

I know actually. Maybe issue? never heard it. 

I wish same. Correct - saying 40 BMI real problem point isn’t near that. People love hate. Follow money. want reopen economy. Killing grandma cash. short-sighted see denial makes economy worse. never know true numbers. like diseases history. massive range wikipedia page. Ban Americans latest coronavirus projection University Washington’s Institute Health Metrics Evaluation shows 179,106 deaths October 1 nothing changes.

Not scientists perfect, probably defer unless data back assumptions. 70k weeks ago? article April 13th lmao. virus U.S. month point. could know long-term effects covid one month? They're obviously wrong, since tens millions people contracted completely fine. Wish could see June. gonna much worse. flu ain't. can. used wear masks they're not? Like, ""quarantine's boys, burn masks!"" something? Talk first world problems. American's complete utter refusal make even smallest sacrifice order help contain thing absolutely disgraceful. March. Surface transmission proven huge concern. 180,000 more? sheep believe kind crap choose wear mask somebody bullied wearing one. seeing CDC commercials telling stay home virus never eradicated. countries well threw first wave mostly still closed. see open process start again. Bootlickers Heroine overdose killer, one banning heroine. Wait, shit. Outside vs inside. 

One worse it’s outside. No. course not. vent, ICU. 1900 show declared 'unconstitutional' staff members families might necessarily able leave alone. can't shut people places employment blanket action like that. ask volunteers, get handful people. people would rather stay home either alone kids/spouses. genetically compelled wipe indegenous populations germs opportunity. CDC. elections generally pretty, personal experience. mean Americans aren’t brightest ain’t stupid Excess mortality indicates either we're undercounting coronavirus significantly, something else killing lot people. 2nd comment read site:     
   ignorant. Doctors warning people health risks wearing mask like breathing carbon dioxide damages lungs, weakens immune system making vulnerable getting sick, causes hypoxia (low blood oxygen) causes blood clots lungs cause infections go brain. Rubio puppet corrupt medical establishment. Top scientists told live it... wear fucking mask. countries shown works. can't believe even issue. slight inconvenience people acting like whole lives ruined. 

This insane me. Probably gone graduation party birthday party people supper... Similar parties: Blood Rave. country buy N95 pharmacies, problem. peak, even buy Leroy Merlin, similar American Home Depot. They're flimsy ones, hard shell ones, they're 5 euro each, adds fast, least protect ourselves. 

When second wave comes, we'll probably see shortages again. say that?

 illegal US walk around naked. doesn’t mean expect customer service employees physically disarm effect citizens arrest naked guy walks establishment. false excuse public health experts. us first half though. Well, help weed unfavorable characteristic gene pool. Even everyone wore masks. There's 1 probably infect world...  supposed show contradiction two things I'm pretty sure I'm gonna get coronavirus skating like 7 people guy hugged without warning Someone else suggested probably already got convalescent plasma. he's safe give fuck anyone else. talking school sports. one last week.  new version “LET EAT CAKE.”

Where fuck N95 masks Marco? shitty green masks ain’t protecting us shit! Asked? Lol like “ask” wear mask. worked well. I'm smart enough know truly know nothing. Constantly keeps trying learn new things, love it. Ok, long win! great man cant lead poor man pulling down.

there much cuomo many political figure denouncing him, people actually believe bad rumors him, cuomo's work never 100% efficient. ""Yeah know China handled well."" /s Shit got weird there, thanks input. 

Also note: song lyrics solve covìdiots. country built lies ignorance. foundation. surprising completely botching this, all.  unreasonable expect customer service workers enforce law. Local sherrifs police issued statements fine people wearing mask well. Washington state. places experiencing second waves ? would never financially recover comfortable Trump's vocabulary  think beginning truly bad times.

I hope I’m wrong. discrimination

Please stop using term. called ""discrimination"" Narrator: 'They cant' rather get covid listen crap! pill financed Bill gates, conjunction lizard people containing 5g inplant? DONT THINK SO! body! mind probably thought weren’t harm virus *isn’t real*. yeah, pretty bad. I’m guessing hearing protection either screaming drank cup water one hand. watch Fox..

Boston March. first 2 weeks general traffic really reduced. hear echoing ambulances. scary part though peak 3rd week April. last really starting ramp up, yet could tell frequency sirens going fast. fault first place looking Washington leadership That's Twitter, trump said heard 50% would virtually eliminate virus *take note know it’s rough year Marco Rubio becomes voice reason sudden Gaetz isn’t even human being. don’t like Fox News either, you’re saying isn’t even true.

Tell 'em God's gonna cut 'em down
Tell 'em God's gonna cut 'em down

Well goodness gracious let tell news
My head's wet midnight dew
I've bended knee talkin' man Galilee
He spoke voice sweet
I thought heard shuffle angel's feet
He called name heart stood still
When said, ""John, go will!""

Go tell long tongue liar
Go tell midnight rider
Tell rambler, gambler, back biter
Tell 'em God's gonna cut 'em down
Tell 'em God's gonna cut 'em down

You run long time
Run long time
Run long time
Sooner later God'll cut down
Sooner later God'll cut down

Well may throw rock hide hand
Workin' dark fellow man
But sure God made black white
What's dark brought light

You run long time
Run long time
Run long time
Sooner later God'll cut down
Sooner later God'll cut down

Go tell long tongue liar
Go tell midnight rider
Tell rambler, gambler, back biter
Tell 'em God's gonna cut down
Tell 'em God's gonna cut down
Tell 'em God's gonna cut down

God`s Gonna Cut lyrics © Universal Music Corp., Song Cash Music boggles mind. People living pay check pay check income compared cost living isnt enough dont get shit go bankrupt almost lose everything. ""welp, spent money better. poor, TV?"" Fuck shit. multimillion dollar company, didnt put money save incase something bad happens? Welp, asked government help here's billion dollars. Like managed business poorly dont get keep fucking up. mean projections severely wrong far? That’s hard pass bodies?! American wears mask taken seriously since February beyond embarrassed fellow citizens ignore basic health guidelines. believe that. way. definitely think rice, flour, yeast, beans, soups, pasta, tomato sauce...are good me. Also, Lysol wipes, hand sanitizer, toilet paper (haha). existence virus political opinion N95 properly fitted quality standard let air sides. seen pictures nurses wearing shift? said Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine that’s currently phase 3 trials. I’d hope would sort way fast track it, I’m assuming prediction would taken consideration.  sure thinking IFR? CFR simply fatalities/cases caught. actual death rate much lower, believe presenting. IFR prediction know everyone actually recovered. estimated well important number obviously I'm simply quick math based hard numbers know.  what? enough panic porn go around elsewhere. Mexicans! Chinesevirus art war technique. else communist China rule India iron fist? Make submissive business partner leech them.

Trump told XI like China 2025 meant bad business. hard time believing numbers. state, South Dakota, seeing active cases drop quite site shows us 1.12Rt value. click “show cases” overlaps cases graph Rt graph. cases line trended Rt line goes up. doesn’t make sense. Black card exempt, least part Oregon  mean, fraction death rate Belgium, UK, Spain, Italy, Sweden France? 

You best hope virus take Germany geriatric population there... they, 3rd oldest population world? Going online absolute calamity.

But also opening absolute calamity Nobody asked me. I’m physical field know obesoty caused excess calories. Stop stuffing fat face. last option there? Napalm? Worldometers Numbers show daily deaths dropping 1000 600/day June exactly signed this. never stopped. I’m not. Americans idiots mean there's one really stop you.

Except shitty roads.  right read this, ""He's probably already walked comments back ..."" He's moron gets news facebook probably shitty qanonconspiracies!!!!.wordpress.com type website. hes calling anyone wears mask ""sheep"" they're ""followers"" ""leaders"". 

Basically hes claiming people wear masks falling greater conspiracy controlled. He's dipshit. Curious question mind hard ask. enough enough? govt screwing us decades seems like us Americans take it. literally pushing agendas fucking kill us. can't afford healthcare. barely paid. start truly protesting, rioting, rise up, whatever people want call start making people make shit get better? also think people underestimate hard shut NY. 

There huge UN event month went ""sorry cancel flights, locals attend"" ""nope"" within days. there's trading floor.

I seen good case taking long schools though. NY took incredibly serious? behind Washington California shut timing despite much worse situation. sure good job sounding serious press conferences actions joke. took 2 months realize “hey, subway thing millions people ride daily, might bit risky. something that.” Or, “hey, nursing homes full vulnerable people, probably shouldn’t send recovering vulnerable people back them.”

I don’t know going play out, unless Texas/Florida/etc. really completely blow it, think NY outbreak response going go truly epic disaster. don’t see happening states, even things start look worse worse. don’t high risk factors NY sustain accelerated growth cases NY saw. Sounds like need militarized police ever then. Well thats wrong. Cancer kills 10 Million people worldwide annually. May 23 graph extends would 4 million deaths vs 300k covid related. know want believe people going work face starvation. hear people protesting things like removing lockdown let us free mass gatherings blm starting think people care corona anymore. Also blaming government everytime help bcoz spread corona caused people taking precautionary measures acting like everything normal, getting infected risking everyone else around cant imagine furious intelligence community Tax-payer funded self-quarantine. Love it. 
A said exact thing weeks ago heavily downvoted. 300k August 31st. CDCs last estimate also change. right isn’t Ebola sub loves fear porn. ""current environment"" mean coronavirus pandemic? Yes agree would present risk officers enforcing laws.

The *existence* pandemic creates heightened risk public safety officers. Resources already stretched thin. However, masks mandatory beginning **we mess we're right now**. epidemic keeps spreading unchecked unmitigated, risks chaotic things going become, stretching first responders limit.

Manpower enforce mask laws issue, *but* need dedicated ""mask patrols"" nothing else. That's law enforcement works. Make something law, make clearly known officers *can* enforce it, people comply would otherwise. Restrictions go place public mask-optional gatherings. Employers lose ability compel employees go work coworkers wearing masks. lot things come making law simplified version envisioning cops go block block forcing people wear masks. reason opened back rich bored home needed go shopping. Come on, everyone know that. Worldometer adjusted 38,386. 2nd highest ever. They're spring training complex though Toronto. fact sentence true makes want kill myself. Land free home dead yeah sure. people wear masks, likely virus continue spread. COVID-19 give fuck color skin have. 

You said putting face mask, makes look much like criminal. case applies race. Thank God brave woman believed telling truth. Ask Sweden herd immunity worked them. Every school opening plan I’ve seen (from doctors, officials, school admin) laughed teachers know. It’s like people making plans never around kids, designing multiple levels complicated procedures absolutely fall apart third day class Despite upvotes, OP flat Genius follow artists like Twitter. Holy shit mistake. many hot takes turned pissy ""I'm objectively right, fuck you, blocked."" shit.

Totally ruined image people, yeah follow anymore important note stopped going though hopefully start uptrend. deaths Arizona today concerning followers still blaming China claiming Dems denied it. I’ve thinking too. everyone think best stockpile? Shelf stable foods? vaccine late 2021?? starting think want win. way take wrong side EVERY argument honestly want win. think wants go blaze fire core supporters still waving banner follow new TV network guaranteed viewers. r u p supporter early on, become clear interest actually winning improving country. came thread Facebook bunch affluent conspiracy nuts telling nurse blood oxygen levels recorded hospital irrelevant masks make dangerous breath something. 

This gonna happen. see 200k dead. work WHO, though work partnership them. see others see corrupt useless. comes place mainly ignorance actually concerted effort seeking political advantage scapegoating WHO. sure saying agree that, saying successful staff corrupt value human life. Postnord? Well, might get half year, ever :/  That's fair. see middle aged wearing masks going large mass gatherings like protests way young live. experience “ketchupeffekten” uncommon term Denmark. vague non-specific study doesn’t really indicate anything use adjust needed behaviors stem spread covid. Takeaway stay home whenever possible put, distance wear mask. gaaaaatorraaaaaddde Well know seen way walking lately I'd say he's painful diarrhea time now. N95 blocks 95% particles, 1/20. Use inverse square law find blocking 95% anything equivalent increasing distance 4.5x.

Wearing sunglasses blocks 95% light putting light source 4.5x away thing. wonder point road Covid testing common since need plasma people recovered help severely ill. mom (high risk; isolating since March) choked water clinic everybody’s heads spun around like deers meadow. wanted laugh make joke decided might go well, lol. issue union times, protect lazy good nothing worker last tooth nail, average worker sees gets pissed feel shouldn’t way. understanding that’s union supposed everyone. Also lot non union place brainwashed employees anti union. I’m guessing word “my” server bartender. know people refer favorite watering-hole “theirs” think commenter isn’t dumb you’re implying. falsely prop profits give rich time divest sectors expect get hit hardest go short. think know can't ignored, hoping ignore long enough make moves need make take advantage situation. Elevator worse sure. much easier spread keep distance stairs. stairs also completely open-air show virus less likely spread outdoors.

It's completely risk free. still people grabbing hand rails, think better option. 

It also crate natural limit number people visit since many want climb many stairs get top. feeling hugged porch that’s social distancing did. Umm, think need research. Heritage Foundation (certainly lefties) doesn’t even rank US top 10 economically free countries earth. Several European countries ranked higher. 

Technological innovation happens reason economically powerful - following World War 2, manufacturing capacity rest modern world destroyed. We, meanwhile, created massive tech industry (almost entirely funded taxpayer dollars). continued thrive decades Japanese finally caught us almost 40 years end war. Let’s act like “freedom” incubates economic power - far less happy historical accident geographic isolation massive worldwide conflict. fallacy going around reddit. honestly, HONESTLY think economy works, largest group people would dying really hurt economy much. would negatively impact travel leisure industry largely supported 55+ group, outside see nearly dramatic downturn seeing today. Maybe 10% decline certain industries service industries would still operating 90% versus zero operated long time. 

Death horrible course, really think overestimate viruses initial impact consumer fear. live abroad haven’t received it. PostNord? Maybe that’s it. it!!! Watch 'American factory '- Elon like Chinese boss would think wish article stated many people attended. Correct incredibly brainwashed ... How? go. Seriously care coworkers get away with? like boss going bonus lost productivity; employer's problem. take advantage free days rather upset coworkers are? Go USA!!! Number 1 everything. proud 👏 get brainwashed management. Also, there's history union corruption gets brought up. Dallas here. social media feed shows friends mask wearing because, freedoms. Lots conspiracy/political memes. Restaurants stores businesses usual! depends store customers masked, stores look pretty good like Sprouts, others like Academy Sports, disaster. neighborhood kids knocking play kids I'm mean mom parents told Coronavirus over. altitude hasn’t gotten higher past months, yet patients still better outcomes. wife’s family planning November family reunion. haven’t one years, guess best time...? 

Now I’m send article them. ask oldest one least *read* article deciding attend. 

Sigh..... Lol Fox news censoring Rubio another 4 letter word starts D... Ideally lungs melt fuse chest cavity, happen, btw Actually, would fit well reducing number people ICU: can't high ICU numbers tell people stay home admit ICU. That....did address literally anything said, go Karen. NEED to. Elon modern day oil baron, people need voice Same! Learned doulas stuff. see conspiracy theorist. 

""Do rEsEaRcH"" wife hit 19 weeks we’ve appointments person (San Diego). stay car, though. Unions awful (except good ones remain) truly believe need unions america havent worked one. anything good say unions are/were part remaining TRULY good unions. lead story goes: ""... one family shouldering health crisis never expected face.""

Why expect it? whole country talked months. Everyone expect it.

Yet stuck millions fools think they're immune absolutely basis believing it, get diagnosed they're completely stunned. think virus fake lib plot, thought distant abstract force hurt THEM. 

It's like driving 100 mph without seat belts stunned injured wreck. ""Injuries never expected face."" 

Morons think way US remain forbidden zone long better-organized countries gotten lives. He’s troll, hanging baits got electrolyte. Nice get political sub politics can't discussed much moderated. Either go politics subreddit go hide one Trump troll subreddits uniquely American problem; even countries far greater safety nets facing reality right now. Absolute beast car. Insanely luxurious speed! came close dual Germany. I'm envious Boi Surprize!

*People taking pandemic series surprised all* Exactly. People U.S. highly competitive independent. wants hear union going take money return defined pay schedule emphasizes tenure merit? Unions create race bottom little effort put job continue employment receive meager annual raise. always meager spread deserving undeserving alike. many people know spent years talking prepared zombie uprising nuclear winter freaking wearing mask able get coffee driving. Bullshit! halved number ICU patients 33 days show world rapidly steadily declining death rate far ahead rate global decline. Unpopular opinion: people need die US take seriously. no-mask-my-freedoms people missing less money TBF, Jimi Hendrix experiencing things *higher* level others, catch drift. Nevadans getting deserve. known better worked someplace classier one side tight still trying pretend pandemic control testing isn’t important right now. Also Turing blind eye unprecedented corruption like what’s going Flynn career officials fired lapdogs constantly. Quarter million election day optimistic... incorrect assume focus figure ""like"" form personal attack suggest do. Concern =/= like. look PUA? think may healthcare system. 80s chances better healthcare since made far already. see that's stupid question shaming moms wanting fully informed helpful. could referring anesthesia used, painkillers, excruciating pain holding baby feet hitting incision 10x day feed. mean supporting politician that’s likely opposition politician opposite side binary actively trying suppress union activity give even leverage employer? screwed? Like, means herd immunity never happen get soon 2 months later? 40 cases one small town outbreak monastery happened. Controlled propaganda!! ""Ranting bullshit"". OK, good talk son. I've made point, go back echo chamber. think it’s funny lot people (not saying you) don’t realize stock market doesn’t lot lower class communities. Unless invest stock options literally effect. people say “the stock market going up!” they’re excited either luxury owning stock, don’t realize can’t really judge economy stock market. Well, personal economy guess. guy hosted.  they’ve announced possible conceived lock down. obviously wanted disease could sing tune Come Eileen Yes, revert back original law included exemptions. I’ve never heard enforced motorcyclists though NC mandates motorcycle helmets well separate law. Costumes coronavirus masks would end illegal though. Ventilators contribute (further) lung damage acute kidney failure, it’s likely decreased. Avoiding ventilators unless absolutely necessary won’t completely negate risk, could definitely lessen degree leave less lasting damage. People also don’t realize person-to-person contact isn’t hugs handshakes. know, thought that's weird term! According best Danish friend term he'd heard before.  knows. We’ll know around 3rd week July IMO protests impact. Ah. Well we'll see. still scheduled open weeks. 22 year old research assistant injecting vaccine authority, virologists involved effort acknowledged they're involved... Got it. Thanks! completely agree. Emphasizing death toll projections probably mistake, even act publicly releasing figure going affect outcome. think probably referring model comments. I'm sure model useful way behind scenes, I'm still kicking credulous enough take projections face value, I'm kind mad epidemiologist guy basically laughing 200k figure. bit humility called circumstances, think. 100% compliance, 100% time niether realistic necessary. need enough keep R0 low enough level stop exponential growth. imagine Oncology team?

Like wtf, tried save life repay us?

Are joke you? Denmark quite well. relies heavily Germans tourist industry many places bookings normal levels. RemindMe! 3 weeks Plus Constitution has, oh (27), amendments try clarify original document founders omnipresent. people still fails obey law really openly write talking about? “scientists still know exactly dwindling antibody levels mean, lower levels necessarily imply people already recovered COVID-19 vulnerable reinfection within months.” Thanks, also looking I'm assuming people merely paying lip service necessarily taking seriously, possibly think half ass it, since ""really matter"". OP sounds like decent person, royal ""you"". husband getting vasectomy tomorrow!!! Yay! two kids isolating months made decision easy. Except police unions. Fuck that.  Prime example Intellectual Yet Idiot Lol someone already copy pasted Thai comments nobody reads people’s posts anyway. Exactly think unions place point time patterns emerged federally regulate shit like stops happening. Offer better protections employees companies would gladly fire reason added dollar profits. Cellphone data?  He's mad 30 year olds parents going die; 80yo mother made decision, chosing show party.

We isolating wrong people. goes show. smaller pile shit still pile shit though. I'm honestly surprised I'm sick morons. know people legitimately advised doctor can't wear masks. morons making look bad hurt disabled community. truly understand people refuse wear masks. makes look like toddler throwing temper tantrum. How??? smoked weed Joe Rogan's Podcast. mean company lay people recession. would thought.  Yeah. mother law got sick lockdown even though lots covid symptoms told tested unless got lot worse. That's case cities texas now. I'd expect 10% positivity rate probably equivalent like 20%+ NYC lockdown.

Texas never really case numbers even go down, though. lockdown effectiveness looks like moderate best, still smoldering embers infection everywhere. soon added fresh fuel fire burst flames immediately. Exponential growth gets hand quickly starting seed 10,000 active cases instead 1. covid doesn’t get you, ghosts former convicts almost certainly will. making mistake focusing dismantling unions rather adding institutions impose accountability.

Workers afforded protections collective bargaining workplace representation. Police also closely supervised state government entities employ them. know lockdowns tracing numbers low working keep check. isn’t pleasant solution countries like US social safety net control spread


Masks help way things. People still attend grocery stores work cannot always socially distance people contact tracing ""muh freedoms"" masks.

Numbers numbers thats damn mask. need start socially shaming people arent wearing public. Well. . .surprise Good! Kill infancy. research yourself. Read past. saying agenda solely nefarious vindictive. saying read headlines miss nuance. nuance case pertains character something objective person would consider instead accepting everything face value per MSM. F7cking morons probably thinks hurt Trump's feelings.

Such mind cultist. USA one worst 1st World couuntry handle pandemic. Worse lot 3rd World countries.

The mental gymnastics people trying defend 120k deaths special kind stupid. rest world looks USA sympathy country could much better buy won't.

Its anger pitty dossapointment  Lol, sounds pretty selfish. Like... *their* wedding. Many people around showing self-centered thinking sad see. I'm thinking either virus mutated already making less deadly hosiptals data knowledge treat recover patients now..its beyond crazy see hospital visits yet deaths ventilator usage numbers following trend all. Correlation doesn’t mean causation. don’t hard stats. Houston didn’t even large protests. many places huge protests still low amounts cases. Kansas City good example, big protests boom COVID. 

Also applying 97% stat meaningless don’t tell us many folks went protests. 

Also explain places Lubbock midland Texas didn’t large protests insane amounts cases? 

You’re making claims little data. posts indicate seem bigger problem protesting COVID-19. Surprisedpickachuface.png aimed person, responding ""at least they're better Americans"". That's state, y'all! Sometimes I'm Chicago burbs. havent really issue contactless delivery. never ask text ask leave porch declining *steadily* though *rapidly* claim. compared countries, relatively slow decline becomes evident. 

Forecasts one thing hope trend continue downwards, untrue *rapid* decline. northeast U.S. well right now, wonder long keep up? increased traveling summer season July 4th coming up, infected people suddenly cause mild resurgence? Elon Musk always piece shit. huge stock stories former employees his, talking shitty person horribly manages company. entire brand marketing. reason companies function well lot people buy cult futurology accept terrible conditions normal. necessarily unions issues, general lack regulation. better come ban passangers US.

Friend mine went Caribbean private atlantic crossing sailing tour charter 6 weeks hard lockdown right hamburg harbour. Fuck Elon. Man asshole done nothing show true colors since pandemic started know weight loss efforts trigger body’s set point go higher? body actually works losing weight.

Fun fact: none true Stay home you’re scared virus. Simple that. Worth noting regarding observed number deaths across population, rather rate death among infected individuals. Yeah, kinda understand then, pretending like everything fine go shit insane, really shame people try careful  Summary... Don’t use public restroom. Precisely. human challenge trial current vaccines ready phase 3 seems brainer. Obviously human challenge trials anything let's throw wall see sticks kind approach. Oxford example know safe based past research. point matter work. Unless I'm missing something allowed human challenge trials point would know worked could already distributing using it. 😂😂😂
This made day. Thanks! No, mentioned herd immunity something accomplish 2020, something hold hope say 2023 case find vaccines working summer\fall 2021. happens, could least maybe comfort 2-3 years think maybe slow many people would then. can’t counted on, really screwed vaccine work. would basically spinning roulette wheel 3rd 4th getting COVID-19 wondering one lands ventilator.... That’s bingo! company’s inability reach them.

Because available 24/7 even working. Fuck this. Honest question: Dont atleast 3 months worth savings? are/were hoping go World October. Still making payments get email week services/activities cancelled.  I'm starting doubts it'll even open. know reopened week. think writing wall. got convince rest family. inlaws gonna fight think serious. reads, guy stay home... infected guy host party invited everyone place (doesn't say specifically home, implied saying hosted it). mostly way west VA county 8 reported cases. hospitalizations current cases. REALLY hard convince people comply literally one sick. keep mask pop go businesses, number really low people wearing them. one reasons hard manage US, different location location rules one location overkill others. Oh shut boomer  Bezos rockets too. like Bezos hair. Bezos implants. maybe locking people homes seem like bad idea true! 0% chance getting infected mask, 0% without mask, 0 * x% = 0. chance 0%, numbers start matter.

Why fuck explaining primary school maths adult? Sure, offices agents trained protective detail? Secret Service also law enforcement agency conducts investigations such. Oh darn person never say thought agenda was.  Forecasts one thing, actual real world data doing? Cases California averaging 2-4k suddenly shot 6k last two days. spikes insane type comment purely personal attack. adds nothing conversation. Man imagine hwat I'd de ith extra... 200 year think key here​ *they* never suspected. double standards sides aisle remarkable. Dems see police unions basically turn mafia handcuffed country, want apply concepts every employer country. Amazing really. 

A big problem unions type wage raises, maximum hours, mandatory benefits great, eventually get work quality, absenteeism, HR side it. Basically meaning hard discipline fire employees either terrible work, nothing job, even showing up. Lol JD power... lol dude, come fuck on. read piece shit? Dodge rated near top...guess happens give JD power money? many stupid fucks buy publications make money folks rate? Actually fairly correct. need replace ""Family"" household.

&amp;#x200B;

If visit parents right also outside time - following social distance isolate fairly well. (Neither wife need leave house work)  Yeah probably right. Family supposed beautiful thing, sometimes things like back stabbing, distrust fighting inheritance makes wonder cruel. Police unions can’t fire shitty cops fan way. record almost 12k state NY course Texas Florida could push numbers couple weeks. Insane. south getting washed Unions Auto looooooong history Typical American: ""Just 33k? Forget it."" can’t even get guy crew ride line truck wear mask they’re truck together. 

Tell put windows way down, tell guy wants windows up, wears mask. Otherwise windows down, regardless hot is.  Yeah, overall cases rising rapidly, lot midwest (he's NE) pretty much control *for now*. single case 2 months get people thinking over, like they're even paying attention states cases skyrocketing. horribly morbid, I'd love could learn experience tell others importance wearing mask keeping safe distance, kinda want know many die. Statistics would suggest could 1-2 people group 18 right? Masks stupidest hill die on. It’s piece fucking cloth, get it. add 2020 list Surprise! Y’all got RONA! Stay safe there.  mother Miami.  good situation, hopefully careful OK. Listen. Covid give fuck from. contest sucks most. fuck OP felt necessary disparage Americans GLOBAL pandemic know. simply pointing there's shortage dumbasses world can't bothered wear mask stay home problem solved. want believe Europe beacon common sense unparalleled world it. want bet hugged people hugged her?

Because I'd take bet. biggest fear order lockdown works told unnecessary worked. Professional Gamblers: Well work too

What cruel mfing cold blooded sob fuck bastard true course countries like Taiwan Vietnam avoided significant outbreak (as long keep way) viewed best examples pandemic responses.

I mean Singapore example manage massive outbreak one occur. kept deaths low worked tirelessly test isolate infected without losing hope. unlike US people keep saying lately we’re going get anyways us live oh well. Colorado bub. I'll sitting back popcorn lol nipped bud part, full confidence Governor protect us crops again. He's done once! work well state. Yeah, pre-pandemic best friend would share stuff double dip time. Unless one us sick, didn’t care. 

Shoot, don’t want lot alcohol, sometimes I’d split drink friend. glass, one made us. weren’t going drink two whole huge margaritas would rather split one. 

That’s pre pandemic, though. kept sleeping usual fakery till centre... like KKK power...total science denier cruel mentality. Hell yeah people want another paid vacation.

Is think felt? know either, also working whole time, suspect lost job would freaked fuck worried family, saving every cent could could find job again. think people were, like, living dude. really bad? hurt us. Well America got distracted something else May 28, even many health experts started encouraging mass gatherings, claiming dangerous long something important. Nothing surprising people's reaction recovery people returning work filling jobless claims. Basically whether overall unemployment goes not. crystal clear Trump want help.

He's guy charge. He's dividing us, starving us, killing us, crippling us, lying us, erasing us. states support Trump showing poor numbers! approximately 70 days till 1 Sep. 124k. 180k need 800 per day, close now. However, 300k need 2500 per day. current increase cases per day make disbelieve 800 per day, would hope somebody reacts 2500 day. Christ. I'm supposed flying trip next weekend... sure do. 😔😷 Thanks correcting error. lol working unemployment + stimulus? Well third Orange County seem give fuck double major biology microbiology. classes lots pre-professional types(pre-pa, premed, pre pharmacy, etc) general premed types particularly intellectually curious. cared something going mcat. would ask question ad nauseum.  

anyway, left fairly dim view intelligence medical doctors Masks 2-5$ everywhere, use one give zero fucks.. deniers would say faked data. cites really obscure source. people cant saved. masks needed made mandatory. understand job depended corporations votes. keep making stupid comments sources. stop that. Yeah think that's gonna par course workplaces almost everywhere. Good intentions that's it. know low. test deaths Shame; I'm fan Static-X. new album delayed due legal reasons, can't hold tour? $174 gonna enough convince otherwise. nothing public slap wrist mitten. surge plan start using. TMC Houston stated could 10-14 days stays course even surge plan exceed capacity. also stop elected surgeries well. find hospitals area still room. heck broke loose would open field hospitals back NRG stadium. would one heck surge go far. Hope people straighten would get far. Actually, epidemiological terms worst death rate possible. much higher response would much aggressive would situation we’re now. IFR 10% example would triggered worldwide panic causing every country close borders international travel - still done said beginning. say stupid things. excellent video. Dr. Bauchner talks Micheal T. Osterholm virus going back Professor Oaterholm started tracking coronavirus back December.

 says knows less virus 6 months ago- meaning knows nothing. virus keeps surprising him. says thought would follow influenza pandemic model trough 3 months.

Now, likens “forest fire” burns wherever wood. gives examples virus keeps transmitting even Germany, China New Zealand.

He literally says doesn’t know know. lot testing isn’t effective. Contact tracing issue high level virus transmission symptoms. 

He advises social distancing main thing. Masks: he’s watched footage studied use 25% people don’t wear correctly. Shriners. fucker talking Shriners. USA! USA! USA! WE'RE #1! WE'RE #1! WE'RE #1! WWE performance center they're pumping 3 shows week Florida. Go back read parent comment answer question you. get medical advice doctors health organizations. spend hours looking whether masks work. Also reason (even though proof do), lost?

Ohh God months walked around piece cloth face bother hinder life way! God why!!!! tell fellow cohorts House forgoing testimonies today.  gotcha. misinterpreted know Michigan reach 100. That’s great uncle started get retested. annoyed greatly. I'm sorry y'all deal that.

Certainly still crisis, 47 million right 180k total 180k more? Although virus dangerous MSM making seem like it’s absolute end world kinda shit. chose waste time resources finished making waste. population urban guys bum Donald Trump. Catch 22.  Okay everyone asks question asking provided trying learn something. Okay. Sure. Let's go that.

And wonder people stupid days. people like you. Would please take step back, take deep breath, realize anything known mitigate transmission, degree, worth implementing?

But also, time, virus ""just"" discovered, we're still barely able function - rely data similar situations.

Regardless;

 

 

 Boo subjective. I'll judge bug tub lard asking? TeStIng = cASEs. 

It's simple math right? Actually, long people protesting wore masks, virus spread much. answer question: yes never include TB these. Please *please* let go doctor worship. MD’s take two years classes - masters programs - many years clinical training lot rote memorization learning repeat means diagnose treat things already understand. Every person two letters name leader academic medicine, trained understand deal emerging pathogens yet well understood. med students epidemiology courses taking part public health side program almost always struggled statistics modeling.

When comes understanding happening *inside* body domain physician. Stop expecting MD’s automatically epidemiologists, statisticians, virologists, environmental health experts, biomedical engineers, industrial hygienists, profession beyond purview you’ve always believed doctors supposed “smart”. big brain. genius. Theyre invested sensationalism. Trump loses take ratings hit. Always follow money. 62 median (the middle number set) strokes means huge increase incidence strokes among younger people set.

That's median works. That's average. one stroke lower age (let's say 40) enough put median much lower supposed much calculate average. earth mean? countries China US, options could taken.

That incredibly dumb thing say.

Who cares tested, pop positive virus...

Its almost like cares making state's numbers look much like Wuhan back January think find air conditioning plays big role, also NYC hit hard least partial herd immunity. California's early success means people getting fatigued lockdowns/isolation/masks going get hit. Copy Limited size venue valid firearm license forbidden wearing mask public carrying weapon.

As March 2020, EEOC declared COVID-19 pandemic meets direct threat standard, based guidance CDC public health authorities regarding risk community spread institution restrictions. IMPORTANT – standard may change businesses must stay up-to-date.

Since COVID-19 pandemic currently considered direct threat EEOC, business would likely solid ground require customers wear face masks covering entering premises. said, business would absolute right refuse provide customer service based upon customer’s refusal wear mask.  faced customer refusing wear face mask covering, businesses likely limit questions following:

• unable wear mask disability?

If answer “Yes,” instead additional questions regarding disability demanding documentation, business consider moving engaging customer interactive process determine possible alternative methods service would allow business keep employees customers safe, still providing service/goods customer.

Trying help. trying jerk. God bless. think mean 99% lower projected. 100 times lower doesn’t make sense. “What’s me?” logic egotism doesn’t work pandemic like this. people survive fine.

Well yeah. problem NY, NJ, CT done doing. problem 50 states rather three states working together.

I obviously expect state low spread go full lockdown, expect take common sense distancing measures banning mass gatherings mandating face coverings indoor public places. spread starts, expect halt indoor dining reduce capacity public places. That's happening, states flattened curves take extreme measures avoid another round shutdowns. comments Houston mayor today...

“We monitor situations move weekend.”

And Turner also called crackdown mask occupancy violations, going far proposing ""board shame"" identify non-compliant businesses.

So we’re inches away going full-in outbreak... countless people dying COVID many illness would taken care hospital beds... going monitor situations move weekend proposing “wall shame”.

Lol pretty easy reach people, telephone, email, letter, emergency contact contact them, boss could gone residence check them. Ugh, damn allergy cough.

I've mild ""clear throat every dozen minutes"" cough since March. least, that's noticed it, right US hit state emergency. every headache, every scratch throat goes away sip water, every cough sneeze, wonder end. Well, appears grandfather go. Maybe hope survives first, hope punished death? I'm pretty sure that's previous job tried ""punish"" me, citing ""poor work ethic"" even though performance stayed consistent even improved longer worked there. (Arby's)

They kept trying call get cover certain people never showed told got upset noticed towards back half time there. Twas stupid it’s starting come true. Sad indeed. think even hours cut covid qualify harassed continuing reply People around complain hard even thinnest masks worn loosely gaps. don’t understand. 

I go make sure thick multi-layered masks braced otherwise sealed around face. go home marks, minor pain, and/or cough don’t complain. 

But still breathe fine. Wearing loose paper mask adjustments seal gaps way feels like standing behind sheer scarf. 

Other people serious lung / asthma issues, don’t understand it. mean companies treat employees like this?

I let go boss gaslighted owner. Suddenly, need me. image he’s even wearing mask correctly. I'm I'm also casino worker. far restaurants casinos get closed due positive covid results. Even casino work already positive cases servers mostly. 

Every week since reopening 300+ cases number dropping. tourists coming Arizona California two Kaji l mano l major hit states.

Whether we'll going another lockdown month July. Number wise look bad 600 000 residents 13 000 sick change dramatically keeps going on. immunocompromised family going back work still dice roll. get one test get back work monitor health see symptoms we've seen symptoms take time manifest.

Those working tables serving restaurants, takes one sick person infect many others. Depends flu.

Spanish flu much, much worse.

I think I’m going drop “ultra-part-time”, maybe 5-10 hours per week. get $800 level. could imagine supply chains matter more. healthiest country still suffer that. Walmart? mean company bullies fuck suppliers vendors lower cheaper prices dangles non-existent carrots in-front get drop pants?

I flat told asked work security solution LP. lab Florida scammy joke. One Repub friends said get Trump 2020 masks “then whole fake virus stuff would go away.” Apparently Dems see masks, halt evil plot. Got jabronie yesterday, told repeatedly put mask wouldn’t help, said going sue taking condition consideration. condition may ask? Claustrophobia.....I’m done idiots lol fans? what?

Go harass someone else leave alone. corona-parties Ischgl actually overwhelmed contact tracing started epidemic Scandinavia, Sweden included. I'm sorry, ""not expect"" this? like February early March unknown. possibility, could US accurately reporting 80+ deaths? mean would also explain lower total death/M curve. might us forever, dying? Eh. Pretty bold claim something death rate substantially lowers large percentage planet. I'm aware single vaccine track that's targeting cellular antibody mediated immunity, I'd enjoy educated point one. exactly virus exploits. biology circumvents, also takes advantage belief one enough intellectual capacity accurately measure. develop vaccine counteract biological aspects, ya can't fix stupid. blame many things: racism roots hyperbole, war Iraq, Dictatorships Cuba &amp; North Korea, Hilter's rise power rooted inadequate use hyperbole induce fear so...what death rate makes people go ""wow...that's lot!?"" 200,000? 300,000? mill?

M’y wife HR. state saying it’s okay go back employee must give return date. stayed touch managers doesn’t mean gave return date. wife term someone EXACT reason. say would come back could provide doctors note. Alternatively another employee would provide return date understood signed termed. company can’t indefinitely hold position pending pandemic one time. agree. got cold back February, nothing since then. COVID can’t get me, nothing else able either. actually intriguing point make, would genetic variation ACE2 shown impact morbidity. Interesting nonetheless. Trump never let Pence power. don’t want say it, hope I’m one thinking it... Man, get it. Musk ruffles people's feathers others think he's Tony Stark whatever. I'm trying get clarity profit comments. hard believe he's billionaire become way via zero profits, rather duping investors. I'm def expert public trading that. God comment gross. arrogant entitlement willingness throw human bodies onto little freedom campfire.

Is really country become? Arrogant willingness sacrifice thousands lives guarantee one’s freedom fully self-actualize living “free” crumbling càpitalist dystopia?

Jesus wept. Getting NFL season going real challenge. lot change get constitution, suggesting ignore constitution? fuckoff come back. give fuck question was. Plus hate reddit ignorant racist culture. That's many people hate you. there? know, private start-up early stages. think profit rightfully high list priorities anyway point. left 2000, went public subsequently got bought Ebay 2002. baby lockdown amazing. Today I’m third day back work :( Earthquake Mexico will. high enough. average IQ goes 100 100.5 that's helping much... new York state whole April. obviously higher since preliminary results survey, 21.2 percent tested NYC antibodies, compared 16.7 percent Long Island, 11.7 percent Westchester Rockland counties. rest state, 3.6 percent tested infected recovered nearly 14 percent sample 3,000 people tested positive antibodies. Also , you’re young person persistent cough think it’s job REALLY thinking cough going like 20 years career. time use car, go vacation, eat meat non organic veggies, buy disposable stuff, causing wreckage initial bombs would (you mindless consumers).

Our lifestyle *more* harmful nukes would've been. We're making planet unihabitable *during lifetime*, beyond stupidity, fucking tech gadgets. happening right now, sea dying, know long insects die off, follow suit ... couple years ? decade maybe? could stop it, idiots want yet kids bring vacations using planes, fossil fuels, plastic shit, use AC instead building passive houses.
 decades ago, could've limited one kid like china did, within couple generations we'd stabilized liveable sustainable amount, instead bred bred, we're deep shit *still* bright enough species take limitating steps.

Kids born nowadays ashamed angry parents. ""Should"" OSHA eerily silent lately... Shut. It. Down. checks balances want police, don’t unions. court system whole problem requires public large see police infallible. get hopes up. unlike Sweden, Denmark actually exponential increase testing. Further, one looks data last days trend going downards again. always said cluster outbreaks would happen. happening. also said would contained. also ones can't afford. People seem realize going safe visit family another year two. owe Company life. willing protect workers, one show also use masks religiously stay away other, quarantine shut down. 

But sure. Asia full athletes. Elon Musk baddie? happened tells people lies like fuel reputation genius businessman, reality he’s human garbage that’s worse Bezos. fans refuse see that. That's Germany Denmark Thanks pointing out. tired complaining subreddit constant criticism people leaving homes. still leave go work everyday. everyone privilege staying inside 100 days (and lets honest, really necessary? can’t go occasional drive walk??). know Zoom, Facetime, duo tech make things work someone typically gone along Sweden's strategy, wish country would make mandatory rule masks... feel like article needs go viral virus itself. Lots idiots taking pandemic seriously might reconsider see pictures people look like things like getting infected. Well gotta magically disappear US days people go buy fireworks beer! know opinions meaningless echo chamber fear. oh entertaining remember never wanted participate graduation ceremonies, kids weird lol We're similar situation. partner 40 now, clock definitely running out. I'm glad get pregnant started, we're willing accept risks (both older first-time parents ongoing pandemic) going forward point time.

Granted we're Canada city 1M+ we've handled things reasonably well far, handful new cases day last 2-3 weeks. Obviously change summer continues things keep opening stages. Stupid families, yes. Nah, Grimes always like this. pretends woke shit, people worked accused nasty behind closed doors. really care enough stop supporting work though, done anything particularly bad music good.  remember watch TWO anti union videos March 9th, right? still 2-3 weeks people started kind waking going on, panic buying grocery store notwithstanding. first admit know fuck unions police unions I’m probably list president one here, asshole, don’t like make generalizations anything, much less things don’t know. 😂  Superior Court judge actively remove Sheriff. homemade mask materials make difficult breathe. people using vacuum cleaner bags, pretty good filters make damn near *impossible* breathe they're designed air pressure human lungs easily generate. people over-layered masks point smothering.

But banning masks people made stupid ones like banning bleach dumbfucks injected it. Love blaming people willingly get tested instead providing enough tests... Wicrosoft? Tonight eleven, Elon total dick

In news, grass green water wet. SHOOK. US testing strategy. Children taken away fuck?? Go Florida Man! Go USA! Keep Brazil away gold! Many employees recently tested positive, spoke terminated...Elon turd touch coworkers? Depending location company, companies allow external email access hourly employees employees abuse clocking overtime. would hourly factory worker get said correspondence? new record number deaths today that's trailing indicator. % positive record levels state state government list current hospitalizations. mention state actively trying influence ICU data. 

So tell number matter. typed lot words there, actually make statement merit.  also universal healthcare + sick leave! Right. I'm saying valid reasons vigilant privacy Americans tend think concept privacy 100% based logic reality there's lot cultural bias goes along that. see example open-air urinal Taiwanese pre-school. Americans feel need privacy taking piss? What's logic that? Truth none cultural hangup need privacy that. course, include there's *way* I'd take piss full view strangers myself. :) admit 100% cultural thing makes feel way.

That's say SE Asia's concept privacy different. simple, binary thing less privacy. issue far complicated. smaller community alone LA County 2000 cases, mentioned elsewhere, definitely seen correlation lower income areas, Covid cases unfortunately. think we're ""we're going ignore pandemic federal level, millions die, oh well, can't really anything economy"". least know names probably result sort mind altering substance instead pure billionaire ego.

""We got high mushrooms hitchhiking across Mojave Desert 1978 that's got name"" much better ""you got name father pretentious dickhead"". I'm even supposed here. ""common sense"" debunked, ""younger generation,"" son. Big Lots one going buy car based ethics zero options. I'm sure done nearly enough lunatic cultist followers worship much I'm gonna lie, dairy part draw keto. Kinda hard hear give up. I'll take consideration might something work to. Ty advice though. I'll decide forgiving cheese worth get hair back... Agreed. America would never let happen infringe upon rights horde much wealth. start til friday. agree, required mean people listen. 

Miles better ""suggesting"" mask use though. shut whole store getting rid everyone else there, people start talking evil U word. I'm 30 partner 40s. really stressful choice us.

If can't child naturally, I'm willing hardcore fertility treatments (I think could still keep job), adoption agencies might willing adopt older couple, really can't wait long fertility testing figure happening, doctors fertility testing normally trying year (and might even longer). feels like lose-lose. Nothing personal, sorry. feeling salty. can't decide place enrages amuses me. Yeah I'm coming. Living hour outside NYC, completely control months ago. county 10k cases still crazy close city. want bring something back go backwards. Plus, tri-state area states announced mandatory quarantine travelling 9 states including NC Publix thing. teams aren’t allowed disclose health information players? We're exactly things perfectly UK,

Worse America, fact. sounds like total chaos disaster there. Brits pariahs around world very, long time. Probably sent minimum wage employee lol brought lunch work despite time. Idk man whatever say. either go back work hire someone else. It’s governor allowing bars/casinos open again. work absolutely need unionize. I'm pro-union understand lot jobs need unions anything, blanket statement ""every job"" wrong. Wearing mask properly? knows, see people wear face masks wrong way, it’s like staying without face mask ""in worst regions"".

AKA Florida, Texas etc. Anywhere freedum important personal safety safety others.

The protests, outdoors, lots mask use, shown real bump cases. That's ""nothing burger"" claim. EEEELLLLOOOONNNNNNN!!!!!!!!!! could def riots. people bumping shoulders, 1000s idiots rioting. way man. Lithium reused can't it? Yes - social distance w aunt older lives alone. comes over, brings folding chair sits car w fan running. sit 6+ ft apart outdoors, downwind her. visit 30 minutes. put groceries trunk label fridge items, prewash pack produce wearing masks/gloves. goes back home, wipes cold items, puts paper sack back fridge 5 days (virus dies long). Everything else stays trunk 5 days virus die labeled sack kitchen.


We also go groceries, medicine, cleaning supplies, walks/exercise early morning one outside. Oh no. ok? doesn’t violate either those. HIPPA effect unless Doctors office. ADA requires accommodation long endanger others.

The reality anyone really unable wear mask right now, COVID almost certainly kill get it. out, would super glad stay outside let employee buy groceries. unions able operate coherent manner? confirm: work guy owned BMW, talked working weekends, bought Tesla I’m guessing haven’t seen photos floating river looks like actuality. 

A bunch strangers tubes bumping other. Sharing beers, beer bongs. Clusters along shoreline. people drink willy nilly gets. Hays County Texas (where lot people float) shut river floating numbers spiking.

Someone know, ER doctor interacts covid positive patients, floating river almost every weekend since things opened back up. Also attends parties. Idiots. Even highest medical levels occasionally. teach Jacksonville. Also keyword article ""want"" .

School year 6-7 weeks away. districts make students go class 6 weeks, prepare bunch students getting virus bringing home giving everyone else. inevitable. need till least Christmas break. Good. It’s bunch 70 year olds working pussies I’m guessing workers referenced American factory workers child slaves working cobalt mines Congo? THREAD LOCKED DUE POLITICAL CONTENT understand states like Texas 4 opportunities (China, South Korea, Italy NY state) watch happens careless unprepared proceed careless unprepared.

Cancelling elective procedures measure taken didnt surpress transmission basically backed corner.

It caused lot collateral damage done places unprepared...But Texas states ample opportunity watch could prevented rather desperate measures like this. keeps rising, basically run script hotzones:

* distributing case loads due capacity limits
* converting non-ICU beds makeshift ICU beds
* emergency training nurses physicians stuff dont usually handle
*staff shortages felt need say ""well Europe messing too, see!!1!"". fact we're completely blowing first world country similar experience.

You defended US response even though simply worth defending. untouchable - deserve criticism need take without ""no U"" response, one made. Testing went mid-May flat since percentage positive continues trend up... downvoted here? people either need wear masks not. Currently pandemic people need wear masks? know masks aren’t total 100%, even N95 isn’t foolproof depending treat it. anyone surprised? know someone got protesting I’m shocked. don’t disagree you, impression (perhaps error) technical work getting started (that’s said he’s credited with, didn’t know people think he’s involved end now). flatten curve overwhelm hospitals? point past 3 months?

Well, sure. flattened, would kind neat stay way, rather turning back upside-down V. i'm sure /u/endthelockdown202020 real poster might less effort let fanboys think they're right. ghost 'em blast mars together. That’s reasonable, see start spike two weeks so. Fourteen days upper end incubation time. fair, think they're struggling understanding 1st order effects nailling 2nd order ones bit ask. leadership feel lacking? Man, hoax virus sure looks like fucking lot shit up. Walmart? company basically PAID US GOVERNMENT operate business - - walmart pay employees enough, government fund food stamps subsidies, exist country? seems implying cloth surgical mask protect COVID. said people protest wearing masks. probably one unlucky marches came substatial contact virus.  mean reason stock high people money general don’t support lockdown. article won’t hurt Tesla anyway. It’ll also benefit people ready willing take place people feel unsafe return work. Tesla. companies. We’ll see happen many people. Chaos favours bold. It’ll give different type person access unemployment. 


It ain’t right ain’t fair reality. known corona viruses region. funding research would early alert emerging viruses ability independently verify information, rely Chinese government tell us wants tell us. part wile global network identify emerging viruses/ diseases. protect us- because, obviously seen, diseases travel. earlier aware them, quicker respond limit spread.  


I would think would obvious, apparently not. It’s enough. Try driving hundred miles one trip. surprised see anything meat plants. quarantine social distancing measures taken, meat plants closed. Then, costs, economical way get rid animals would put down. Reason costs money food keep alive, supply chain food limited everything else shutting down. Another reason since selling animals, money spend food. Trump altered rules allow meat plants stay open closing would ruin supply chain. became known virus hot spots. CAN'T, problem! speak language... Stay strong! nuanced argument go well Reddit. But, areas like Texas, AZ, etc. locked time NYC NJ. still time track trace. But, also lockdown made much sense. outbreaks time March April. people pushed re-open cases there. extremely hard keep society locked longer months. Sure introverts Reddit society can't. would better start SIP later cases developed. I'm sure necessarily make ton sense actions took NY started time. could done soft type actions like masks right bat. Elon cares money. got big bonus year. rotten man. Well... knew going bad seems going catastrophic. better start standing temporary hospitals Olsteens Megadome. cancelled order way back March claimed corona hyped. Saying fuck nothing article. Engineers get fucked 6 ways Sunday barely get anything return. Seems like well balanced commentary/analysis. Someone already down-voted course. cared sort thing, probably replace wrote ""Welp, we're fucked"". echo chamber likes stuff. Im pro unions.. dont think argument applies union?  ____ unions cant fire shitty ____'s Yea, trying find article explains aerosolization risk infected people breathing 3 hour thing. Oh Tesla enlightened company right? doesnt make work open public keep payroll.

That point PPP loans forgiven instead paid back.

You getting fucked. know. Owning Tesla actually one goals next 5 years. continue move forward career rate been, within price range. But, way handled, along things Elon done past couple years, made think twice.

I hope another car manufacturer produces electric vehicle would like own. moving direction, currently reasonably priced ones interested in. mission sell luxury cars rockets air force. image ""people's billionaire"" façade jabronie

Did give people's elbow? little lot...? Good point. MPH graduated top program last year wondering this. CA imagine like Pennsylvania don’t want go full lockdown again. perceived risk threat community going back period try avoid can. people really thought elon musk good guy. wait cities start crumbling tunneling watch he'll take credit ufo's start appear frequently. goverment using musk fall guy. Although yes technically Australia, cases 1 state, Victoria. 5 states 2 territories reporting community spread weeks months. Borders currently closed Victoria states. means Australia actually remains nearly free covid, except Victoria. Western Australia, covid restrictions July 18 due community spread 2 months. Exposure time cut drastically reduce currently acceptable power levels far-UVC. That's big bottleneck thus far: regulatory standard allowable exposure based shoddy study rabbits 1980s use clean power source. FAR-UVC manufacturers produce right data convince regulators lights could cranked require seconds exposure. 2nd attempt:
Well wishes healthcare workers without hazard pay like telling u ur good job metaphorically taping u head. See, u feel better totally dont feel dismissed. Keep up!

Absolute absurdist meaningless garbage. People like u, ur faith gospel mindless positivity, aggravate. 

In world order, money talks bullshit walks. Holy fuck entirely missed joke. okay? healthcare unaffordable, perhaps people may seek help already late all.

But also different strains one hit Italy NY considered worse regions. city moved fireworks celebration airport advising people get cars. That’s awesome! 

We live three hours away relative. local family, though. don’t distance her. (somewhat) fair them, actively resistant distancing them. Wants babysit grand kids, wants old relatives visit, etc. 

We can’t control her, control around her. Walmart? mean company whose employees rest US supports welfare benefits pay poorly? guess I'm anti-mask conspiracy.

I'm mostly commenting emerging consensus masks alone enough, need anything else, that's proven studies look countries lockdowns curfews social distancing masks, somehow get result masks.

There evidence that. place discussing evidence, choosing sides. like say, either group group. stop testing we'll nothing worry about! Look 0 new cases! could stayed outside, anyone ounce sense would suggested lieu indoor party. Better yet, party all.

This 100% negligence. People right pissed. Kkk hoods better mask all? NY got better getting really bad. also understood logic governors order people compliant made sense. That's function NY. coincidence. Also, NoVa one richest areas Virginia, right?

Wasn't point lockdown first place? flatten curve overwhelm hospitals? point past 3 months? previous long time employee Tesla, surprise all. Business usual. without details word mean anything Given causes blood clot mild symptoms some, seems possible. I'm Calgary

So saying Calgarians apathetic ignorant? count young patients cases still counting cases? take two online classes stay track associates degree still needing go work, I’m mechanic, nearly lost mind within first week. ended calling advisor telling wait go back classroom. bad grew hearing this, minus trump part?

In generalized sense old conspiracy theory framework that's around forever: ruling class different rest us best intentions mind. People sort instinctively know feel matter year is. specific plotline changes -- cabal Jewish bankers trying eradicate white people, Hillary Clinton running assassination human trafficking ring pizza parlor basement, secret Kenyan Barack Obama trying institute Sharia Law send grandma FEMA camp, etc. Surprise Grandmafucker! Thanks  Maybe. know lot idiots doctors, however. people... Also help USA propoganda vultures. performative language

Agree much. Somehow constant casual lying became socially acceptable, point seems like people think things say become real say them. fully rabbit hole. don’t know anything Enron then. Thank displaying ignorance  I'm South Florida county I'm bad. one COVID hotspots Florida. Unfortunately, stopping gatherings. next door neighbors either side partying family members masks sight. social distancing either. least twice month. took drive around neighborhood, spot piles cars quite houses. They're partying asses without care world. Wingstop.. bastards ""When I'm dead, throw trash.""  *any* decent billionaire industrialists? think sociopath one.  another invention greeting card industry.   know, people SARS still showing immunity 11+ years later. know coronaviruses generally confer immunity terms years rather weeks months, think anything we've seen yet makes us think one different. 

There's stuff coming lately antibodies diminishing \~4-6 months. said, people much smarter r/COVID19 sub say surprising, real immunity T-cells, finding patients tested positive recovered. may little mixed up, that's gist. 

The net every reason believe COVID immunity, likely forever, probably least year two more. one saying immunity lasts two months. Antibodies may begin receding time. Antibodies may recede undetectable may still immunity. questions don’t know answers (but based total lack evidence don’t believe people getting reinfected two months would well documented) truly insane Arizona people waiting 13 hours tests prioritizing \*symptomatic\* individuals tests testing sites. Symptomatic patients -- cough -- contagious asymptomatic patients. sickeningly selfish people ""just flew plane want safe"" blocking \*actual sick people\* getting tests.

The U.S. testing strategy absurd. No, I’d look places like South Korea Japan dealing much longer. South Korean stories reinfection ended detectable traces dead virus. "" OSHA SaYs DoNt WoRk!!!! "" Yup. Pretty close. Still surge way, like 2018 flu go insane restrictions high emergency room volumes filled hospital beds ""not uncommon"" Ha! see I’m one corona math...

Did wipe take package enough? Two weeks. 

Did leave package long enough? Two weeks. 

Did runner get close? Two weeks. 

😂 Haha Elon fucking asshole clearly don’t know hysterical means, really stop using it. said anything spacex I've worked enough sales bros know listen engineers they'll opt ship half-ass product 3/4 time opposed ship whole-ass product correct amount time. financial products - can't imagine something like car. Jumped today, always lag numbers increasing. Florida desperate, love say bad insanity started week ago. Ah yes totally unexpected Walmart government assistance numbers employee bulletin board pay enough? 'Cos that's say BEETUS It’s starting go back again. 

There 34 cases tied bar Lansing, another Traverse tied group went winery tour hit pubs restaurants. NEVER THOUGHT LEOPARDS WOULD EAT FACE know it? guess Elon got tired Tony Stark decided Bond villain instead. Castiglione D'Adda, 1.7% population died COVID February April. one point 70% blood donors antibodies. 20% population (mostly older people) them. pretty conclusive study imo, timeframe 2-3 months antibody loss people. still tells us nothing actual immunity.  got tested isolating possible trip back home see family Ohio also moving new town.

I'm depressed see reopening, especially there, know soon. I'm already reevaluating travel I'm trying take many precautions others can't even bothered wear mask. Friends telling I'm overreacting ""are going go back Thanksgiving?"" Well yeah there's still PANDEMIC Surprise! aged well One dude office rigged supply line elderly mother's apartment balcony. sticks stuff basket pulleys balcony, spray Lysol leave outside while, pulleys trash. *are* ways still help elderly relatives without putting risk. 2 people fired people never stepped foot back factory, told press factory conditions bad.

If provably lie press, think expect fired. people want quit, else would lie press?

What company know fire people lied press company? know any.

It weird many people missed part article home people told press conditions factory bad. stood dumb original article still stands one. RemindMe! 2 weeks He's egotistical arrogant drug-dependent asshole, would've known? helps, believe idea antibodies begin decay, body 100% vulnerable again. probably still resistance virus. obligated work companies obligated pay nothing. Don’t mad company, need money paying hire replacements willing work.

Yeah totes unpaid leave works. problem! remember gobsmacked first read many years ago. fuck got pancakes breakfast? correct. definitely exposed misinformation sub.

&amp;#x200B;

I think Covid-19 going give 1918 H1N1 Spanish Flu run money, we'd daily deaths averaging \~2,500 get 600,000 deaths (medium estimate Spanish flu's death count US) years end...

Or averaging close 1,900 deaths day March 4th (date outbreak really started ramping US)

&amp;#x200B;

In first round outbreak, March- mid May, deadliest day (April 21st) around 2,700 deaths total. could. could also mean using higher dose similar radiation described article require protective gear. Even far UVC light produce tissue degradation high enough dose believe. personally suspect US healthcare system large part - lot people US - even ones form insurance - actively avoid engaging healthcare system financial reasons. ""high levels pre-existing conditions"" another facet this, since many people US put things become actually critical. It'll actually safer, well-tested, autonomous features.

Assholes like give ADA bad name. ADA, work support myself. Without accommodations, I’d living SSD, i.e., tax dollars. every asshole takes advantage makes harder people like productive citizens. plain fucked here. still question accurate numbers portrayed are. One thing guarantee numbers, skewed, side caution worst case... Virus? virus? Similar situation here. work large regional company thousands employees, though quite bit fewer Tesla.

I surprised learn fire someone abandonment every month so... certainly newsworthy.

The think it, actually surprising 2 people got fired circumstances, probably something happens regularly anyway. Yeah exactly it’s easier plebs downvote feel better Thanks. didn’t know this. Climate change making worse makes sense. Ok, fire hire would uphold law. can't tell boss I'm going job want whatever reason... mean I'll lose job. think mainly people states never locked down. state(PA) 3 month complete shutdown businesses non life sustaining.

People afford buy stock value economy most. Lockdown anti thesis economy. babysitter doesn’t show up, don’t pay her. It’s simple. Imagine showing next day also wanting pay night didn’t sit. Imagine shit talking neighbours, offended don’t want babysit anymore.

Except situation all.

Elon Musk told employees could stay home felt unsafe penalized it. employees stayed home, told could, penalized it. expecting paid time work--they opted take unpaid leave, know bothered read article. 

Here's fixed babysitting scenario: dangerous situation house. tell babysitter show comfortable babysitting job still danger passed. Per words, babysitter show up. fire showing up. 100% agree there. funding system public schools (being tied taxes collected locally) archaic, perpetuates inequality. country desperately needs reform education system top bottom.

Twitter man-child tells plenty companies leadership. Betting Trump brag it, loves best old woman saying wear underwear mask well....things need breathe.

I zero faith country able control this. eye opening upsetting. Good thing plenty historical examples respiratory illnesses suppressed vaccine available, examples back scientific claim. Light up! That’s way better anything could come with. Wait 89 new deaths coming from? Miami Herald states post quotes multiple people officials private citizens, opinion herd immunity. misinformed like you.

And claims Tegnell said herd immunity, heres direct Sweden's strategy herd immunity

[Tegnell, State epidemiologist - lot *nudge nudge* direct quotes. face mask never protect person wearing it. It’s protect everyone around you. Someone face shield able go place requiring face mask still exposes everyone else. look history then. They've NEVER good workers Tesla. Ever. He'll good saw FL fired COVID-19 data lady, bc wouldn’t compromise data. Much respect her. Can't read paywall.  425k, many positive? think positive% number testing better metric. sincerely hope you’re age 13 commenting something ignorant generalisation 2,000 people. win stupidest comment day, congrats!!

I’d stay late come early time needed too. make plans days even plans sitting ass playing fallout. Go away! ‘Batin! Florida already +1755 reporting from: Miami-Dade (most populous county), Broward (2nd), Palm Beach (3rd), Hillsborough (4th), Lee (8th), Collier (14th) counties.

Orange Duval set new records setting new records yesterday (554 730 Orange 217 305 Duval) Pinellas shown decline record yesterday (354 282).

So rest counties show increase Orange Duval could see yet another new record today. maybe rest show decline like Pinellas. Or, know, vast majority people asymptomatic healthiest humans planet probably aren’t severe risk.

You brother. risk incredibly low. virus nearly impossible spread outdoors modicum social distancing. seem much spike thousands people protesting.

Also, life spent cowering padded room life worth living. Nah. distributed ventilators states hurt feels. hospital ships needed actions governors course hospital workers. also distribute PPE fairly, ventilators.

He used pandemic gain political points, blowing face. Idiots. [See NYC half population entire state though. newer wave lot young people ignoring social distancing mask wearing, initial stuff March/April hitting old people retirement homes.

So cases, less hospitalization less deaths. Still concerning, bad numbers bit less. Wow thanks really exploring mentality. think nailed head. don’t know chief resident personally (they started dating right quarantine never came meet him) buuut probably like a-political views. describe general apathy. Thank you. whole air “because we’re doctors know” *arent* scientists epidemiologists.

I wondering inside info, ICU around others are. 310 million go Elon musk turns another billionaire, already know yet love theremin. Consumer confidence car registrations? real economic data? Hey Elon, don’t schmuck like Bezos. mask wearing strong divide political lines. gallup poll, \~97% says they've worn masks outside last seven days \~67% R says same. Also notice percentage people says worn masks outside, always wear masks outside.

There also big divide whether one believes people without symptoms stay home. \~95% say yes \~32% R say same. Less half R says social distancing last 24 hour.

So whether see lot masked people outside going strongly depend locality. Since anti-maskers also likely less socially distant, also see street out. really surprise? would imagine expected thousands maybe millions protesters streets past month ( wearing masks all).. Even worse, highly survivable disease- overall- relatively young healthy, know likely going survive, even get it.

Imagine thinking plays mind someone already mostly care others, also highly suspicious hoax, part broader conspiracy unseat trump/damage US, etc. could actually enforced I’m sure would effective.

We don’t vote assist brain surgeon fighter pilot certainly shouldn’t rely cart full morons guide nation. Thanks, see now!

From understanding, tests confirmed cases ratio something judge things accurately by. Basically, 10 cases 50 tests one day, 20 cases 200 tests next, number confirmed cases doubled, halved case/test ratio.

With Denmark's high number tests compared relatively low number cases, imagine many missed cases, confirmed cases judged stand-alone. Thus, increase cases worries me.

For country higher case/test ratio, might better look easily tracked excess mortality judge situation, nearing average, means either number total cases (confirmed unconfirmed) decreasing, they're getting better keeping people alive. Racist. Preach! exact quote. obvious lie.

Nope. missing word ""stop"".

Advising people wash hands attempt *stop* spread. telling people feel unwell stay home.

We know large proportion infectious people asymptomatic. staying home spread virus. know virus spreads air well surfaces, washing hands stop spread.

The methods described link stop spread virus, every nation earth recommended methods.

At best, *slow* spread virus, exactly Tegnell planned doing. even explicitly said better allow ""small trickle"" infections short term prevent greater number infections later.

I know never admit it, already turned huge mistake cost thousands lives, fact: Letting virus spread always part plan, herd immunity unspoken goal. Chinese looking Italy thinking “we welded homes yet weren’t ready”. Italians looking NY thinking “we made direct passionate pleas yet weren’t ready” New Yorkers looking rest states thinking “WTF people really incapable learning”

At point maybe deserve it. wish could elected sheriff say, wellll won’t enforcing marijuana laws  Sad article quotes workers saying maintained correspondence management. see would lie that, since would easy call lie. Maybe certain areas, nearly everyone wears mask least makes effort social distance. think ford better policies workers right now? reopened factories Tesla did. missed point. used Musk trying colonize Mars evidence caring human lives, person responded saying Musk legacy ego rather actual concern well others survival human race. ones saying can’t good things also care legacy, example evidence Musk caring people. chance conferring sort immunity extremely low. every known coronavirus circulation confers immunity. also old, given plenty time learn I'm wrong ;-)

This possibly important example something people can't learn schoolbook, real-world experience.

Humility one key differences intelligent wise. mean Desantis prioritized protecting nursing homes back March. Comparatively, Cuomo sent virus patients back in. usually work out? People learn lessons different points different ways life. whole thing wake call lazy. Excellent demonstration universal healthcare needed, too.  likely guy would gone seen doctor/been checked out, co-pays, insurance all? husband never got either..  he's *lying*, hot spots.

Just wait week see at. Can’t say didn’t give us tools opportunities take better care ourselves. Wow. /r/selfawarewolves Really well? covid death rate 0.5% right? that's 2 million deaths. rest us 298 million people still left stimulate economy vote November.

For one, hypothetical scenario exist Tesla. use Office 365 half-baked version Exchange Online email. I'm familiar IT. email accessible xmail.tesla.com employees trained add mobile phones.

Second, article linked specifically says received ""voicemails"" meaning tried calling person purposefully ignored calls. 

Third, number companies want hourly employees checking emails exceedingly small, instead *much likely* would simply ask employee log hours spent checking email. super likely Tesla set expectations worker employees needed check email regularly.

Everyone wears masks L.A. go shopping. store let otherwise. actually laws require employers protect safety employees. everything, unreasonable employer exist must ensure safety employees (within reason). Hospitals Houston's Medical Center move ICU patients beds normally used critical care.

It’s good extra room but, article indicates, run too. 

This real mess. damage control. hard watching friends relatives lose everything nothing.

99.5% people die this. know that. Kroger union employees don’t get maternity leave paid vacations. Plus pay actually worse Walmart’s.

Having worked one time another Walmart honestly better Kroger clearly labor worth $13. worth more? Maybe. see that. 

But currently isn’t. offer $13, people (who labor) accept exchange labor $13. 

Your calculation labor value is, better worse, one free market uses They’re age group it’s highly unlikely anything severe happen them. you’ve heard 10-20 athletes getting it’s statistically likely none severe symptoms. Two people terminated. stayed home. I’ve seen says 85 percent population needs infected herd immunity kicks in. That’s like 200 something million people. don’t know that’s right wrong it’s late game we’re screwed. Thank responding something I’ve really trying ask around here.

Snowflakes can't put mask on, claim ""but allergies"" bullshit.

Wear damn mask. I'd like see sources ridiculous claim. According cars safe even better rating Tesla. They're dead, suck seances. could recognize discrimination tell Trumpy snowflakes fuck off. We've got country run pandemic manage. I'm tired letting ignorant snowflakes get hundreds thousands people killed. disease alone 40 9/11s counting. start spelling lying right anytime now. dude self worth need boost, quit lashing we’re team. Blacks Latinos wear masks! 

Increased local Corona deaths among Blacks Latinos. Surprised Pikachu face. Federal Reserve published study thing like 2007 historical reflection. complete lockdown healthiest thing local economy. Partial lockdowns nothing lockdown bad long term. 
But instead reading literature govern based feeling sense happen. So....Continue.... think means since you’re social distancing cases continue rise Yep. I‘m glad quarantined last 3 months, slowly started going 2 weeks ago, again. HEYYY least people didn’t wear mask. travesty would been. B-but Elon good Given antibody tests considered useless point, fuck knows.

And it’s raging south, expect 50 million either fast approaching, already there.

My boss told today everything failure, it’s almost like point everyone going end getting failures completely unacceptable response federal administration. Look back crisis February March see patterns dismissive attitude approach health crisis, followed White House attempting rewrite history period backpeddling. instead getting ahead controlling message dismissing crisis throwing fate wind.

You want keep economy going cannibalize efforts letting virus spread stoking fear consumers keeping economy afloat. Even content letting people live comunication public needs stress importance following CDC prevention measures assure citizens working state local governments help mitigate crisis. Yes citizens take responsibility others, need cohesive messaging starting top mobilize people action. “We lose 40k people” Roy Moore spreading mall again? This. New Zealand shut early restrictions work living aside closed border.  Holy shit.

Woody Allen make movie guy, he’s expert subject matter. guy forcing nursing homes take covid patients NY lead deaths thousands elderly. room critical.

Coronavirus spreads New York nursing homes forced take recovering answer question dodged it. 

So yes made up. zero idea ""it felt years"", made up.

Furthermore: huge pandemic strikes area, course makes people go out, hurts economy well. takes longer lockdown. What... he's allowed opinion?  Perhaps would way get UV light inside body? injection perhaps? IFR? Certainly 3% estimated early on. Regardless, crappy now, anything made concerned next one. Given sit right virus high mortality rate, one 5-7% mortality rate equally infectious? lack preparedness inconsistent handling/messaging make prospect scarier one. Thank you, doctor. warned: “We consistently underestimated virus.” 

 “We consistently underestimated ~~this virus~~ stupidity American people.” - fixed him. countries lockdown, nearly 100% mask compliance rate much better US, locked down, less 50% mask compliance rate, that.  might want look graph cases states you’re wondering you’re getting downvoted thinking coming “waves”. evidence looked. means nothing. point camp even consider Swedish strategy worth seriously speculating about, article funny me.

Which supported case, meaning speak people, represent viewpoint quite well, leading ""corrections"" wrong downvotes justified. 

Speaking which, PMing something dare say comments mature thing. Divided conquered slavery dollars. linked stats show many ICU beds occupied COVID patients. number risen 120 three weeks, trend upward-exponential.

There’s way they’re “normal capacity” new patients, unless happened starting unusually low capacity surge. Either way they’ll saturate quickly rate.  It’s almost like top 6 valuable companies world American. Indeed, certain group people ignorance selfishness.

But another group forced go jobs reopened, unemployment ended, need earn money keep roof heads.

Unfortunately, data showing ignorant group #1 economic power keep victim group #2 employed.

Now makes half opening frustratingly pointless. economy continue tank, groups get sick.

The Americans shot surviving unharmed work fully home, willing stay inside avoid becoming part group #1. data proving economic power is. we're coming vaccine. he’s supposedly going NJ weekend asked quarantine 14 days covid hotspot arizona. denied request said regular citizen, extension, presidential authority bullshit... Yea, Like leader !! Haha remember like year ago 90% Reddit quaffing Elon’s farts like social karma treats? wonder, article people sent home, completely different circumstances.

Well, thanks articles OP posted last couple months point denying intensive care vulnerable population routine Sweden.

It obvious Swedish health watchdog opened investigation people denied care apparently ICU beds available.

This metaphor makes sense. 

The apt metaphor would be:  attempt catch flies bait Vinegar great bait"" summarize, people watching conservative news less likely wear masks. news water wet, sky blue pope shits bears. course, I'm disagreeing that. I'm pointing correct draw equivalency someone grew upper middle class someone grew heir fortune.  saying mitigation measure? honestly sounds like preserving resources oncoming crush covid patients. Errrr nobody died. plenty US immigrants ready bite price time. worry. shitty company work makes shitty cars. still relevant?

Elon seems like one people look past man consider accomplished. think accomplishments legitimately impressive improved society that's would stop. would never praise personally due stories these. order get views across resort right wing media? That's called bias proves trying give merit views world tagging ""right"" sources. 

The truth can't win virus Sweden well countries probably hit much earlier first anticipated (reports today cases early January outside large metropolitan areas) thus making efforts contain trace virus naive best. Sounds like many big companies. Another add list large communications company starts A. Well, two hospital going reminded long time bills start coming pull through.  5% warning flag, ten.

People protesting anything disregard Yes, yet still see poorly Florida doing. I'm saying fudging happening.

Exactly this. friend's father's life-saving surgery still considered elective postponed start shutdown death imminent. Thankfully country got proper handle situation electives province/city resumed month ago, got surgery needed. Yep. Almost like Sweden realized rest world went lockdown, going lockdown going save them. Still poor decision making either way. Remindme! 2 weeks “Universal close back down”

There chance close back down. dunno reported, pretty calm ATM. hospitals coping ok ATM, cases deaths march

I'm mainly concerned we're easing restrictions early, that's different different countries. we're locked England, control health service, ramp lockdown without Westminster approval, there's support that.

We'll see, think may see second lockdown. you’re drinking casino floor, mask either then? 

In fact, strip people drinking? get wearing one drink hand, don’t see much change happening Vegas. anything stop virus, force hospitals continue hemorrhage money furlough staff stay open due virus anything stop.

FUCK YEAH   called distribution. Let's say US averages 10. means might states around 20, others around 10, others near 0. average 10. let's say Europe averages 7.5. got countries around 15, others around 7.5, others near 0. European countries beat US average 10, compare apples apples us states European states, find many us states top european states.

I listed innovative states US top head example, even thinking covid. pretty funny consider states ones handling things well. aware happened New York? Massachusetts? Whats happening Florida Texas? Maybe soon California? Now, clear, think nothing innovative capacity. funny thought making case. Tony Stark real person, Reddit would hate him. understand hate doomsday person. Idk.

Oh forget it. average American fetishization punching down. Nothing makes harder seeing 62 year old woman hunched counter clear visible pain, said customer breaking full sprint complain grandmother's posture boss.

Meanwhile countries browbeat shit mentality, ignore cling it. maybe realized covid19 isn’t exactly boogie man TV politicians made be? Awesome!

What contributed space auto industry? european leaders solified leadership crisis. example Finland, PM's party crisis change PM. time, 13.2% share gallup votes. thr new PM pretty ok COVID-19 response (most restrictions already gone cases still dropping, even 0 cases day sometime ago), PM's party gained lot popularity, 23.2%. Meanwhile primary opposition party gone 24.3% 18.1%. probably one fax machine too, bet. bad? can’t collect unemployment otherwise. had?

Yeah, good Tesla? see what's wrong this. say, ""if uncomfortable working Tesla times to."" people said, ""yes want work you."" replied, ""no problem!"" funny ""early days"" 3 months ago west :-P

But yes, we've learned lot 3 months. use broadly supported

Ah. guess that's 25% people area use them, county health director house surrounded people guns received hundreds death threats family tried mandate them.

It sound like live real world all. China want Americans go regular business die weaken competitor? Ok. Thanks. see mistake made idiot. life come reason that. still re-open?? Again, answer question:

HR tried reach 2 (TWO) people multiple times couldn’t. Wtf “rights” think have? Everyone else returning work, HR tried get ahold couldn’t. Wtf expect do? can’t hold position forever. Tesla gonna like “o bob sandy dodging calls, guess we’ll wait till decide want contact us come back”.

You can’t serious lmao least make patently clear nothing *ipse dixit* offer. don’t think it’s updated yet. ........ Joe Rogan Uhhh.. No. False. USA #3 population. two front us India China.

You'll enjoy twitter better head far ass

Edit: I'd luck talking wall you, honestly waste time. People like really insufferable virus mutated killed people certain baseline intelligence level person 25? Would sweet

Literally word word, dude. article? Why? Hmm figured would even higher, ton friends gotten antibody tests CA almost tested positive antibodies. anyone know threshold population w/ antibodies herd immunity starts become effective? offer save anyone, publicity stunt got pissy actual hero saved them. Thanks! guess would days actually started show symptoms. wonder long exposure start test positive? I’m wishing that’s bad karma, many around tested positive, don’t know he’s avoided thus far. Unless make point follow varied sources groups (like myself).

Even travel world - it’s human nature gravitate towards people similar mindset/beliefs unless make point otherwise. hoping, hoping...that’s now. Hoping isn’t become NYC again. mean daily basis? Daily new cases per capita daily new deaths per capita? dont see argument supporting deaths staying down. matter time rises continues plateau....is im thinking...... waste. need unions guess question many dying many critically ill. 

If deaths still low positive sign, means young, poor populations whether virus achieve herd immunity - good news countries like India, Nigeria, DRC, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

If deaths under-reported, calls herd immunity strategy question. don’t know Wuhan it.

Think logistics implementing this. 330 million people US. Think essential workers needed implement this. Think people still leave house fir non covid related medical care. Think people live various housing situations. There’s homeless, people dense cities people living mountain tops extremely rural areas.

Think special dietary needs.

Think people refuse government food want arrange meal delivery (ie many people).

Think people need prescription medication.

It’s logistically politically possible. Costco requires everyone wear masks shop there. appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* Stark dick almost died weapons got captured. prediction conference games happen non-conference games canceled quite naive.

One part wants vaccine soon possible part like, sooner comes likely possibly well. (i.e errors work well.) :S 

Also posted question different reddit pages people told that, apparently articles talking different vaccine going Dr. fauci talking about. articles talking ""Oxford vaccine"" Dr.Fauci talking the""Moderna vaccine."" clue whats difference either maybe that's confusion comes from. Walmart? company asks employees donations co-workers? Selfishness deception among ideals. care morality ethics, concern lying, selfishness believes. Get in, burn there's lot people want work us. Imagine caring ""muh burden proof"" comment replied specifically saying HR said couldn’t reach two employees, making reference employees proof correspondence. weren’t replying point, sounds like much trouble reading comments articles lol.

Unless trying make general point people reading articles, case need work communication.

You’re pathetic, dude. Take L go bother someone else. White collar worker here, too. We've told go back office least Labor Day (early Sept). Even around 1/3 us going first.

It could likely older family members pass complications, that’s written stone. lot deaths across age spectrum. recover fine, move lives. feel sorry them

Ya hope case. Covid 19 give life altering side effects too. Strokes, heart problems organ failure name couple. virus real weird effect blood making clot cause emboli, bad effect body. still lucky surrounding countries diligent, get protection proxy.

Literally someone Facebook yesterday bragging skipped work without saying anything go restaurant friends get fired claimed 'taking leave' without notice.

But again, none us know exactly happened point trying analyze deeply guess use metaphor say lockdowns doesn’t affect economy either? think right now, help Swedish image. ok different views things, ok think differently, ok journalists write negative articles, write flaws, errors, corruptions etc, etc, ok press think goverment bad job making wrong decisions, ok. 


And also part ""Swedish image"". posting articles daily bases, part ""Swedish image"".  Slow, disorganized inadequate used critique literally everything government does. thank god. photo folks restaurant gives willies. cannot imagine reading sentence ""97% intensive care beds occupied Wednesday. 27% ICUs coronavirus patients"" thinking ""huh could go brunch public location!"" Opposite, get upvoted shitting him. drive freeway legal safety features.

Nice name calling though. Reddit bought it. OK, I'll indulge stupid replies. let's assume I've sucking Elon's balls long. Please explain auto manufacturers seem wanting suck Elon's balls? think idiot can't see past today's date, shitty troll.

VolksWagen call wuhan virus times problem solved. It’s everybody making shit political. One biggest problems America every last damn thing political prevents anybody power thinking rationally care making “their side” look good. Europe didn’t politicize shit and, look that, actually beating it. Yet, people refusing wear masks “it infringes upon free will”. aren’t asked wear masks “infringe rights”. You’re asked contain spread things actually go back normal, everybody wants. company treat community, workers, people interacts with. really sours perspective Tesla.

Oh Boy, wait till learn company made whatever electronic deice using treats people....or whatever company makes coffee drink....or food eat....basically product service interact with, got treating people like shit. look SARS specifically. general half life antibody depends ability bind things like FcRn, tissue cells, dependent structure protein, isoelectric point, pH sensitivity such.


Also SARS somewhat distant relative SARS-CoV-2. similar. expect went crowded bar maskless ordered Mountain Dew martini glass. ""moves"" made ""lockdown skeptics."" understanding workers want drop compensation package would come unionizing.

Tesla offers workers large amount stock part pay. UAW, main union people talk joining, requires employees receive ""X"" amount pay, Tesla far X include stock, X look cash pay.

UAW consider stocks value looking compensation. Therefore, Tesla would required pay cash, case could longer afford pay stocks employees well. current cash-plus-stocks larger cash-only would get UAW, financial interests unionize.

Ultimately, unionize, workers would get angry enough point compensation reduction worth improvement work conditions. right now, people hurting cash that's priority #1. remember people U.S. saying wear masks like China back around '02 SARS. So, whatever preventing Americans caring way, something new.

It's sad, Chinese government appears care welfare people Democracy does. Summary:

Pixatimod drug mimics biological action heparin sulfate - potent inhibitor blood coagulation

That’s danger every worker, also every worker’s family. enough people feel like security isn’t sure enough risk job over, enough people join strike fail. workers ability refuse go work feel conditions unsafe.

Firstly, safety never come first laws. Workers’ rights came general labor strikes ended laws passed. would nice politicians took initiative passed laws improved workers’ conditions without strike, doesn’t happen.

Second, workers don’t choice, choice it’s enough one. Companies care one thing: bottom line. Legally, anything hurts bottom line, shareholders sue CEO. workers’ rights beyond takes keep plant staffed. 

Secondly, if, instead treating employees poorly would rather destitute work there, threshold you’re talking would get to, Tesla treated it’s implores well enough actually wanted work there? that, even power barter collectively, agreed treated fairly? Doesn’t sound better string failed companies treating workers like shit?


Unions kill markets. stop workers slipping slavery. that, turn, causes people money. causes economic motion. helps markets. marketplace competitive long corporations see reason treat employees better desperate sliver unemployed accept. Nay. Hard nay. It’s graduation party honestly NBD miss IMO outdoors recirculation, open sunlight, outsized effect limiting exposure.

The locations rapid increases correlated biggest protests. They're correlated biggest negative reactions lockdown mask use. New York, New Jersey etc seeing tapering case numbers. literally said “He’s pedophile, I’ll put money it” zero proof (and plenty evidence contrary). straight revisionism going on, whatre daughters musk-federacy? guess kids call Aunty Grammy? Like said one's perfect, see Bezos Musk foundation trying help developing countries? least Gates actually trying something. great PR need, everybody hate Bezos, probably one richest men planet? US UK propaganda/imperialism buddies British Columbia Doctor Bonnie Henry. Got ideas there, Adolf? also discovered water wet sun hot. know want hear this, properly fitted surgical mask effective N95 professionally fit-tested. See Table 5 even small gaps render N95 surgical level protection no. end. dont get person Elon without stepping people's necks. 120,000 (not 100,000) people died reason. preventable. alleged lockdown!! go back ""everything normal"", million could die. Many millions permanent health complications.

Smoking personal choice, that's difference. smoke, kill yourself. anyone else.

With pandemic, might kill others too, that's acceptable. can't understand difference, least know selfish ass. think Cook much higher population density, though? (Cook) one point kind assumed density part reason. idk sure. Reported. Ignorant snowflake outside safe space fairness wearing outside parking lot nobody around completely pointless, unless want virtue signal Ford like McDonalds car companies. Shitty Ford cars last like 5 years. suspect FL never gone 30k tests unless counted antibody tests (and never say include do).

The data absolutely wonky. way 2x tests one day rate never reached previously. Reminds another person cult. Hmmm, what’s name again? Can’t recall. reputation within tech PC hobbyists *terrible* 90's due Microsoft's business descisions. I’m supporting anyone. don’t care small reduction testing regardless reasons. I’m looking advice idc get anyone. minuscule reduction meaningless. Death rates falling, could million cases deaths would bearable. Death rate matters. it’s becoming less deadly data suggests it’s important log every individual case. total number cases irrelevant death rates falls close nill. id hardly call closing 13 testing sites nation 460 million people corruption. Worked alright cousin’s birthday. gifts delivered opened camera, played remote games, everyone stayed pajamas, got see everyone’s pets, usually doesn’t happen party. again, we’re introverts. Might less fun extroverts enjoy loud music crowds. guess dad gives couple million blood emeralds time cut life. Legit whistleblower hero model drive regularly self-assuredness? Oh yeah, totally. yeah honest, *was* exact moment head went ""he's probably terrible boss... least might get us Mars"" ""ohhhh he's shitty person around, he?"" Nevadan here. I’m gonna argue bad idea terms spread, want establish little export little commerce, officials hoping save residents reopening casinos early possible. said, lifelong Nevadan, really wish could figure another economic base, like exporting solar energy. Thursday, state recorded 5,004 new infections, bringing total infections recorded March 114,018 cases. state also recorded 46 deaths 203 additional hospitalizations.

How could happened? disagree. still useful visual. letting perfection enemy good. chart helps show growth epidemic, rightly shows curve flattened. 


My issue simply smaller issue. seemed like incorrect numbers. Guess require citations evidence.  end hospital, move goalposts deaths Sounds like something low intelligence mouth breather would say really. let stop crowing black people affected more. know buses pollute less? It’s way efficient cars, shifting transportation efficient methods much larger environmental impact slight improvements efficiency cars. daddy muskrat actually cared environment you’d think he’d use “clout” actually encourage change. bought founder position first major funding round (he external time.) went Rogan downplayed corona virus deaths, saying states reporting them.

For someone supposedly data driven ignorant excessive death stats (hint deaths reported) speak confidence staggering. 

he obviously spreading bullshit Tesla plant closed hit DERP Combined Syndicates America  place end like new york. unique situation mishandled Cuomo&amp; De Blasio ways aren’t present now. mean, win. failed contain it, won. sensationalist all. disagree you, also like fact solution lead example. people like want safe ones persuade others think &amp; follow simple guidelines?

Unfortunately, leading example many flaws plenty room error. people take others wearing mask automatically exempt wearing themselves. ""Everyone else wearing mask, to!"" I've seen mentality action. 

There also others think hoax. I've spoken people scoff employees wearing face shields masks facility despite County requirement. think ridiculous.

There people facility still move chairs closer use wrong doors despite plenty signage employees telling multiple times safe way facility. met eye rolls sometimes non-compliance pull ""if ___ we'll ask leave"" card. 

I understand educating people huge part this, we've educating people months *still* people take seriously. numbers reflect reality. That's can't agree leading example sure-fire solution get number cases down. 

We resort enforceable tactics else numbers keep climbing people become sick reason governments wanting us push forward reigning things back in. Gotta keep em addicted somehow. imo autopilot something it. advanced driving assistance flaw got overhyped thie fans led lack situational awareness driver thinks autopilot cover reckless driving forget ""unknown pre-existing conditions"" step.*



*Not applicable countries universal health care. happening states reopened early enforce social distancing masks.

NYC steady decline cases, hospitalizations, deaths month two yet large protests.

NY surge new cases wear masks outside. think make huge difference reducing infection. Especially states like AZ, FL, TX, AL, etc. majority population wearing masks cause ""mAh liberties!"". VW huge scandal? sure better Tesla Let's assume, insult person lives. That's mature. Remember guys, Surgeon General two months ago reiterated:

""Seriously people, STOP BUYING MASKS!"" left downplayed virus's danger? need stop shit. 

Walmart pays 13$ hour.

jk thanks letting know

edit: say hope week goes well. :) Elon successfully developed cult personality enhance business operations. correctly identified Americans weakness cults reaping benefits.

I'm denying he's smart person. *am* denying he's ethical person.   Team Six

That's good, come yourself? werewolf went away, people village went create beautiful economy world ever seen, much better economy previous mayor, least that's people saying. beautiful story. Water wet good fall back statement stupidity tesla VW lying emissions, trust VW. lot people show up. Florida. course gonna try fix numbers advantage. ""It's garbage CAN, garbage CANNOT.""   trump went TV back March/April time advised people wear mask, isolate take coronavirus seriously, untold numbers people would gotten sick died. Trump blame staggeringly large numbers right now. Fact. losing bit real though hope okay man. Meanwhile bars &amp; restaurants still open. Dumb sob [In contrast, Cuomo cancelled elective surgeries state-wide tens days first 100-new-cases well ICU capacity got anywhere near maxing out. experience lol think trying protect yourself, realize trying protect him. Oh jesus. I’m happy could cry. hope opens way developing countries Southern Africa receive doses vaccine ready, without wait inline behind entire developed world. probably don’t care searching truth

So exactly find “truth” every institution world (since research institutions agree US research) wrong makes sheep? Sounds like something shitty Elon would employees.  extremely rich person stepping lot people's throat. 

That's get extremely rich. RemindMe! 4 years Oh. zero evidence accusing employees lying safety conditions factory there's daily work place injury caused part Elon disabling noises vehicles make backing up, warning signs taken like aesthetic? 

Are well trained Corgi? glossed whether dog, important. record, idea whether well trained Corgi not, seem like could someone's lapdog. Oh shit! don’t work Tesla, happened too. boss told stay home stay safe suppressed immune system, terminated coming in. Fucking crazy! Oops, meant get long runs 20 miles! form viral marketing uses bots and/or paid posters (gallowboob) promote content tailored groups internet, masked organic content. Add healthcare cost that.
It real mess hospitals now. Three closest friends combined birthday Saturday bail? Eh. people reasonable page others think probably legit need help well this. I'm currently told several people different post I'm going potentially kill family 4 family members attend kids outdoor birthday party, wear masks sit 10 feet away lawn chairs. plenty people trying balance life still taking seriously seem become full agoraphobic accuse anyone leaving home murderer. That's concerning. He’s guy complains “unelected bureaucrats” US keeping plant closed pandemic time boasting plant China reopened

Take will. one days week higher like 6 deaths, I'd definitely say flat still falling slightly. AFAIK thats true. What? Why? 

Completely unrelated shit

Elon's fuckery negated dad creep. 

Very weird attempt ""whattabout"" situation.  better treatments. understanding I'm saying, I'm saying unimportant, I'll drop one last attempt clarify. society structured way always people bottom. Telling someone develop skill get better job great advice individual micro-level, impossible/useless advice societal macro-level. Nonetheless, I'm happy bettering think social media makes world much smaller. Obviously, get lot different perspectives.

I assume they’re varied. people never got first check? got mine friends never got used drink 3 bottles whiskey day, made feel bad. stopped fine. celebrate drank 3 bottles whiskey day, feel bad. be? could happened? nav autopilot available people pay extra full self driving little less common. Russia cases Covid record number pneumonia March. doesn’t take much reasoning say missed cases. likely North America. begins... good luck Arizona, ride. 

Stay safe Wesla? Makes reconsider buying Tesla trying turn tides hate given him, hate want. certainly say quoted verbatim. context gave impression stands also proven via court case. 

[Here's article show said, 100% Another ignorant disgruntled employee. 4 percent death rate, three quarters one die. Señor Frog's Unless pear reviewed paper bother, there's lots aimless theories going around moment, take care kid man.

If want clear evidence I'm saying look Europe, socially distance, wear masks stayed lockdown months, US opposite happened people still interacted like normal Europe cases dropped like mad, US high ever been.

I agree mental toll pretty heavy unfortunately US fucked half assing lockdown, meaning stay much longer Europe. Fuck Joe Rogan. Yea sure, like aids virus /s Trumpism death cult. Yeah real, Russia killed 180k Americans we'd shrug off. Muslim country? Nuke em. I'd like see full letter sent again.

When first heard news, assumed meant would fired. actually think unpaid time off. called back, longer furlough choose work, may impact unemployment benefits determined local government agency — Tesla,”  
.....  CEO Elon Musk said internal emails employees feel uncomfortable returning work, stay home. However, latest email puts workers crossroads — return work risk contracting COVID-19 stay home lose unemployment Return Work Play 

I really see anything saying they'd able choose stay home, unless they're sick.

Edit: Removed ""uncertainty"" added actual quote accurate. Disney Ice could use rinks morgues. Ok gotten wrong then, thought said something much worse. Makes Elons reaction strange indeed. specifically talking US emergency supplies complained expired rotting molding. 

Maybe inventory now, dont enough every single person US. That’s horrible. probably designed for. Keep people cash-poor enough can’t afford worry working conditions they’re treated.

I mean, people actually sell stock they’re given rate compensate lower pay? Home Depit shit company. refuse go working two years getting $0.26 raise year. Fuck place. Forgive giving shit. philistine friend that's biochemist he's recovering ""edibles"" explanation short. Basically enzymes particular raised sickest patients targeted blocked lowered via targeted therapies patient improve - theory. you’re wrong. They’ve made money. None anything you’re saying factual. can’t wait ones providing cars industry years you’ll telling everyone knew always knew would abs always supported them. Abs lol calling flaccid little man. irony here. I’m one that’s salty? don’t think so, I’m living reality weird ass reason, aren’t liking reality, you’re substituting narrative. Also Ponzi schemes definition product, unless I’m going crazy, cars road Tesla emblems?

RemindMe! 4 years “MinderBinderCapital, Tesla” Xyrem - it’s working like charm. devastated nobody took seriously re: fatigue 15-20 years ago could treated back then. try dwell much, it’s sad think life would look like slept half it.  saw Rubio say wear mask day. 

I’ve never agreed before. pretty sure happen -- January 20, 2021. 

Until then, shit continue hitting fan. Trump imagine stories superspreader rally fallout go over? that's quite possibly coming. think ruin image beyond redemption. Let’s stick dicks blender it. Well stupid lasted 2 days. due respect, Americans nuts really want that. ""did best""
Bullshit. figure training wheels Tulsa. knew could fill it, probably sure could fill larger one. it’ll another week time tell, far significant spike NYC, site largest protests country. Yes sure man, blame immigration. true though vast majority protestors (no need quotation marks) reliably wearing masks. they’re good reason, people eat cake relatives feel like thought viruses slowed warmer months? Right? even birthday party child, birthday party fully grown adult. Hamberders Yep. Plus hospitals racking huge amounts of.profit billing government covid everything. Toe nail dinged bill covid ICU. thought onion article. thought whole fight end racism. encouraging discrimination? thinks diagnostic tests, many diagnosed cases. want count test results, actual sick people hospital admits. thing happened New York. one problems enforcement, one reasons always squeamish glib ""just fine arrest anyone breaking social distancing!"" solutions lockdown. Whether social distancing drug laws even sexual assault laws, minorities disproportionately targeted. despite, instances, whites things rate non-whites (such smoking marijuana). Everywhere outside apartment. 

A standard cloth mask virus mutated killed people certain baseline intelligence level person 25? Would sweet mean US surpassed 15 cases total? Easter yet? Man got halfway wish could unread it. Love make entirely add little quips may 4th random niece’s graduations? even write president cannot mandate masks nationwide. could say mandatory mask protocols place states get healthcare funding.

Curious fellow panic attack haver literally second haha. mom used smoker's cough smoked, went away soon stopped. realize everyone. hereby retract misinformed joke lol. 

And congrats quitting!  I’m assuming you’ve posted above. It’s definitely good keep perspective. Spanish flu deaths 500k U.S. population 100 million. 1.5 million equivalent population impact now. said that, covid isn’t exactly finished. beginning wrestle epidemiologists haven’t gone captured excess mortality got missed suppressed first count. don’t believe global fatality count covid million point, probably decade better stats. Lol “5g rays death” Strict lockdown?Bruh literally wedding April state(Karnataka) held ex Chief minister less lol.Come may majority people gotten fed given whole.Nowadays,especially common see lot people walk around without masks(especially evening idk why) one could care less. businessinsider.com may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage, post automatically removed. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* I'll take under/sooner. Ducey actually wore mask Trump rally. Hell SC. governor opened everything said “it’s stay safe” Maybe need ton US flag masks made? people love showing patriotic Alright let's see here, pandemic, stock market crash, ""dust bowl"" literal sense coming way. need war we've gone full circle. cell immunity questionable best. couple studies focused found cd8 cells largely inefficient clearing virus. saw people wearing them. Mainly threat fines, national sport pensioners old folks general snitch people everything possibly can. No. need government supply masks need people get unemployment benefits medical: Interesting! I’m glad copied paste bullshit claims scurried night... 20k Deaths/Month going forward... we're really knocking one park. Probably college town. sacrifice they're willing make? Ok... starting look majority infections happen ""super-spreaders"" even people infected particularly contagious. takeaways currently means tell super-spreader best approach still limit group sizes, especially indoors, enforce physical distancing, mask we're going inside. 

So, words, we're supposed along. shocked appealed. Rick Scott may scammed Medicare system, knows natural threats avoided. AC inside. lol mean, def forgot regan , maybe name boat something ... forget history doomed repeat it. grandparents dying hospital.. Exactly everyone said.. fucking killing parents/grandparents nah bro, phone shit

/s Well, people sudden ignored went protesting rioting... They're taking whole ""Everything BIGGER Texas"" thing way seriously time... even GOP like ""hold horses idiots"". makes sense. swine flu back day asymptomatic. Caught another asymptomatic friend. spread dozens dozens friends family within days without knowing even always wonder asymptomatic stats. Even compared Euro, USD less value. US economy ruins, massive unemployment, debt increasing massively, plus making everything worse economic warfare China. that's tip iceberg. wear N95 mask 9 hours work everytime go store. want stay healthy. Battleships? think rules also instantiated early lot China bashing going on. Hey, least Im honest. mention first impressions vitally important.

Texas locked early, COVID little impact spring impression insignificance stuck.

Now shit dicey everyone already decided COVIDs big deal people generally hard time admitting fault/changing course. NYC

Yes, read wrong.

It's NC (North Carolina), NYC (New York City).

Apart that, fear read correctly. Wearing mask forbidden North Carolina.

It seems exception civil defense emergency declared, may go wearing gas mask (but normal face/nose mask). affect gyms U.P? local YMCA open since June 15th. We’re Phase 5. Narrator: *you know i'm say right now...* Thanks Texas, Florida, Arizona medical people come something works. called ""masks"".

But one influential person said required, would wear one, discouraged others wearing them.

I blame health officials. blame people chose follow medical advice. choice.

Blame Karen Similar 7-Up, scientists looking catchy name. Covid 19 took beyond anyone's expectations, ripping US! friend mine auto immune disorder found place like this, guy thoroughly cleaning chair, etc. customer rigorously enforcing rules.

 make sure operates says. walked store three huge “no masks, service” signs 2 languages least 3 people wearing masks. actually watch press briefings catch headlines happen upon? preparing possibility self-quarantining home event test positive Covid-19, also hurt things like Gatorade, broth pedialyte staying hydrated supply basic medicines. comparable. Asian countries already preparing since SARS crises. EU USA caught unprepared. Considering matters, EU performed surprisingly well. problem, cough entire year allergies post nasal problems, could ever know I’m legitimately sick late? That's counterpoint. deeply stupid thing said.  wear mask, also researched remove store them, avoid touching outside inside, wash hands touching outside, put on.....

Nobody this. People compulsively constantly touching front masks fiddling them. supposed collect viral particles job, contaminated. touching doorknobs, everything. take off, put pocket transfer viruses mask pocket, use pocket likely transfer viruses inside mask since crumpled there, back right directly face again. 

They touch face constantly raise lower mask passing people. catch viruses it’s job, fingers touch face every time put down.

And see countries like Denmark flare results without masks, US terrible results masks. Granted people reporting compliance isn’t high are, definitely high am. Pretty much 100 percent inside crowded indoor venues like grocery stores big box stores counts most. One would think even 50 percent compliance places like would dramatically alter course disease worked, isn’t US seeing. Wow. whole system impressive. single person maskless public. dealing people feel violated wearing piece cloth. Yes. Like FBI, Secret Service offices U.S. compliance policy? Czechia better Eastern Northern European countries otherwise similar things, masks. Good RIP Mask Exemption People Color rule June 23 2020 - June 25 2020. r/Masks4All mistakes intentional? 4th July parties 1 week... Exactly virus needs.. nice booster shot peak levels.  /s/s/s/s/s article said low exposure enough - know translates would good research avenue guess. Lmfao harm reduction. hitting lock levels TX go serve entitled asshats co-workers dropping like flies. TX next new York. Well least good news totally pointless topic. Oh reddit, ever cease amaze me. releases hour long briefings multiple times week speak current state virus around world. press outlet covers one two statements many said briefing. Reddit seems think thing said. 

I know there's huge anti-WHO bias maybe try look less stupid it. *COVID go brrrrrrrrrr* varies household household. seen parents since prior hearing illness. I'm Virginia everyone following governor's orders. 

My husband working home. I'm board ""safer home"" campaign. 

I friend post pictures ""socially distant"" extended family vacation. distant pictures. 

Reading comments Facebook cancelling local 4th July fireworks infuriating. People still planning get together blow things up. babies happen. felony, specifically exempted motorcycle helmets recently. law meant stop KKK, basically enforced random winter joggers, robbery suspects tack-on anyone else like wearing hood. steps taking vain, would better followed thoroughly think already evidence anything better nothing. keep talking ‘unprecedented’ it’s not. quarantines new - frequently necessary many pathogens treatment for. word comes Italian means ‘forty days’, shutdown used slow spread Plague. actions global scale, neither human movement communication time. would doubt effective been, seems like wasted opportunity better coordinated globally now. 
The reason reacted differently covid-19 hidden list - every pandemic influenza virus. coronavirus, similar common cold. vaccine, unlike flu, much way treatment. Saying ‘it’s like flu’ ‘it’s like flu’ fixed minds recent points comparison, reality it’s like common cold steroids. look examples flu recent epidemics, dealing something quite different. 
The epidemics subsequent 1918 flu controlled vaccine. currently cure common cold, essentially researchers around world frantically working on. find one, astonishing breakthrough.  
I’m happy fatality rate appears less severe originally thought, morbidity rate yet unknown. long-term effects infection clear, although apparently difficult convince people caution still needed. fact U.S. high infection mortality incidence shows possess knowledge tools science, don’t help refuse use them. vaccine treatment still hypothetical, quarantine, washing hands, keeping distance wearing masks effective methods proven time, yet somehow even neglected many people. certainty covid, many risks. Striking balance caution without human reactions panic also careless disregard appears eluded leadership U.S. Hey guys, idea! Let's wear masks! Thailand 1/5 size United States..... Much easier enforce things and/or get majority comply Anecdotal evidence, doesn’t seem true couples know. bunch gotten pregnant recently. I’m afraid ask whether accidental purpose purpose opinion drastically change. happens course often not, play together (some fighting may happen, builds character) Agreed. Counterpoint, people needless fearful Yes. People dumber dirt Good eye sad. Honorable citizens harms way Godless fucking orange treason-pig Dotard Drumph.  May have? wanna see Cuomo DeSantis fight wrestling ring. *THAT* would something enjoy. wish answer...there isnt. really. dont meds yet vaccine proven help. good news all...


I wish good news. REAL fucking good news....   Oh, definitely did. Jeff Bezos Bill Gates, mention Donald Trump. fact, billionaires (self-identified well) came nothing zero financial support. Even minor billionaires one heard like Les Wexner. like ban travel states well, states arent.

PA, NY, NJ, Michigan, Etc super well, sacrificed months this. feel way pants god-given shitting apparatus. like

He owns Tesla Turns accomplishments matter someone else would've done anyway  news water fact, wet. need get. control way"" - Anders Tegnell speaking ""herd immunity"".

Well read rest article find part point herd immunity achieved vaccines.

But also Tegnell far superior Sweden's strategy herd immunity

[Tegnell, State epidemiologist - one _technically right probably wrong_ statements. case, going remain technically right least someone research. too.
Stay strong.
We'll get thru one way another. know that's true, information suggest might right now. like they've run tests every population everywhere. I'm sure data margins different confidence intervals, I'm sure there's factors may included whatever extrapolation they're data have. I'll put way, absolute surge deaths protesting that's going on, chances we've mislead.  lmao plenty hoaxers there. Go watch video woman front florida council talking 5g masks killing people. speak customer come yesterday said virus real used get trump office mask policy come business. 

The hoaxers definitely exist. GOP local control except aren't. we. 

Deaths way 

We crushing it, especially people take ny debacle equation.

How many excess deaths ...it sure shit isn’t 130k Covid deaths 


Your fear irrational, illogical

Muh 26% Covid patients 

Yawn Yeah Charleston Horry bad positions right now. majority economy tourism shutting would end closing lot businesses ruining economy years. time opening putting locals danger. need mandate masks see effect shutting stuff again. Voters really failure.

The federal government collects *our* money uses get rich make employers richer. sides this, way.

Both sides equally bad order sides bad promote harm.

We keep electing people care us wonder meet needs. Actually, LA \*used\* extensive public transit. tore 50s 60s.

Stop buying priced junk. Lol stalking me, creeper interfere God's waste removal apparatuses wearing pants, wear mask months. Nah, saw coming first reaction floor it. started hooking beautiful girl. know isn’t social distancing friends. stop seeing her? sex thinks continue see now. She’s really nice don’t want risk family...super conflicted. TX general sense. going wish mask &amp; shield get hit pepper spray. tread me! Well stage 4 Illinois starts tomorrow. give 2 weeks forced back stage 2. Stay safe dude. 19?"" Trump said. ""COVID-19, people can't explain 19, give me, COVID-19, said, 'That's odd name.'""

jesus christ Okay, time fuck off


Says guy claiming adult room. Super interesting man co-host made hard listen to. South Korea closed schools Japan closed that's Singapore you. 

I'll pass trust, thanks! feel people texas, maybe lean right, still different respect social distancing mask usage versus states. 

This wrong. There's huge percentage people ""lean right"". *not* taking seriously. aggressively rejecting COVID safety intentionally undermining measures. get harrassed wearing masks trying stay distant. know. have. Agreed, except Cuomo trying directly compare two. course NYC better now; already went hell. don’t think global health issue politicized anyone, wasn’t people politicized issue. going say word political member party particular want comment actually stay up, leaders went way 100% caused countless unnecessary cases deaths. 

One even came recently said “people wear masks sign disapproval me” something along lines. Like fuck? People wearing masks safety around them, make political statement politician. AliExpress. Search ""KN95 fast shipping"" pick ""ships US"". last shipment took couple weeks.

If hurry, see Amazon $2 (10 pack) tomorrow delivery. Around buy outrageous prices non-chain convenience store.

KN95 asian equivalent N95. work well little bit resistant airflow. CDC FDA approved use N95s available. Apparently updated permission yesterday. read here: They’re duplicates they’re reported twice. counties sometimes report directly state federal system counted twice. Tbh don’t super great system since it’s state/private lab partnerships. Nobody saw coming. Right? agree, man. Nothing celebrate year. Makes sad. think two individuals good cases suing hope get every penny. think closest port hour away. sure much help would be. saying. would give essential Liberty, purchase little temporary Safety, deserve neither Liberty Safety. exact part constitution prohibits masks?  got huge argument w sister bf took trip Pennsylvania refusing quarantine even get tested, simply saying “we don’t it”. went cry 2 hours bf threatened house, literally lost grandfather covid even month later went FL post graduation vacation. It’s absolutely mind boggling narcissism selfishness people. like colendar container. Europe seals borders. Otherwise rise again. Great means came state here...they care begin with. fucked Shore...great...guess go beach end August point.  personally buy nothing Trump steaks, Trump booze, send kids Trump University. want something trust around forever. Stay home bad go:

www.google.com neither...... Incubation time longer 1 day.

Tried tell sister. works bar tender Dallas TX high end steak house. exposed tuesday (day 0) got tested Saturday day 4 (negative) day 9 getting dizzy light headed, cough fever. Almost passed work, yes still working first test test positive antibodies. going get tested today (day 12).  someone waiting hear back nasal swab test results, stop smoking weed? Would harm benefits turns it? holdin NY.

the south RISE ... whoops, think meant this! Death good guy. Tesla stock basically crypto band mate wanted throw neighborhood concert told irresponsible anything encouraged people gather, given rising cases texas many people don’t wear masks. said wasn’t problem audience chooses wear masks. sent TL;DR attractive nuisance doctrine.

Then conversation asked prayers son sick symptoms son’s roommate tested positive Covid...

I it, questioning risk assessment since parents willing host grandma 10 day visit branch family normally cares super careful, friends going try hang one friend’s house smoke session... took something stop panic attack took two giant rips bong... don’t care it’s middle work day - working tomorrow’s diary anyway can’t handle reality right now. Probably didn’t expect someone would go birthday party CoVID19 symptoms. amazed patience lol. That's FL. Look got us! would completely killed cooking process. Wash hands handling raw meat. not, repeat, not, aerosolize raw meat fine.

Washing poultry, especially, spread salmonella kitchen. \#Cuomo2024 sure people always describe wave 2, plan stop wave 1 US.

No, heard immunity option. barely population system already near imploded. mention, strong signs antibodies consistently built may last longer months. sentiment might meant something every country struggling Covid. Truth is, countries gotten virus manageable levels reopened economies. America's dismissal virus means economy hurt long run, less. Swede love read comments outsiders say ""Sweden bad, Sweden stupid"" insider cant see clickbaity disasters media portaying Sweden has. learned elderly mother - he's like us! trying kill old people? Thanks wisdom . best ? Gambling already risk, take another risk? wear mask casinos require wear one. Also fat people. literally goes diabetic fat old. Like designed make America better. like global warming...  met Corona? fired, also dont understand psychology. Mandates made 100% enforceable. made fuether show seriousness issue thus get compliance... full compliance. Nothing 100% enforceable. Tesla profitable last 2 quarters, despite factory shutdowns due Corona. highly valued stock market, valued highly far tech company traditional car company. waiting lists get cars, literally can't make fast enough meet demand.

Sure, Musk asshole. stupid pretend Tesla successful company, especially innovating much getting electric cars charging stations road.  many interviews I've heard even big cities people say ""if God says time go, time go"" brain starts yelling ""That's preventable death works!""

Often info lines. dust cloud full locusts? murder hornets?

there.. nothing say backwards thinking randy Really? think numbers sustainable? That's great, even governor seem agree. Well read rest article find part point herd immunity achieved vaccines. 

Tegnell never talks vaccines article. time whole article vaccines mentioned ""fact box"" explains ""herd immunity"" is. Tegnell saying relying vaccines.

Here Tegnell say big mistake sit say ‘we wait vaccine’. take much longer think. end, don’t know good vaccine be. It’s another reason sustainable policy place.” 

 

That makes obvious waiting vaccine. clearly intended achieve ""herd immunity"" much sooner vaccine would take also Tegnell far superior Tegnell: 

But Tegnell anticipated Tegnell:

""**We little cautious using word** **for breathes little given up**"" 
 \- Anders Tegnell explaining refuse admit persuing ""herd immunity"" strategy. Afraid July Augest numbers going look like. like organization supposed telling us facts, telling us opinions. Manufacturing cannot work home. OP fucking moron trying compare companies industries. guarantee large majority manufacturing workers prefer getting paycheck opposed nothing. awesome story though. hope make movie it. amusing.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* age mom's opinion hook matters, guess better ask permission. Nothing 100% enforcable... even laws. getting compliance. serious stances officials lead compliance. practically free means so. cause enforcement local news report it. That's interesting idea. powers trying pass legislation prevent happening though? hold hope scenario, unfortunately. loses election. make accusations massive electoral fraud refuse step down. base cause civil unrest prevent Biden claiming victory. Total shit show either way. law firm would gladly wear logo suits bottles. I'm sure people thought safe too. Remember though: “it never happen here. Texas nyc”. thought prepared I. Nyc too. Spoiler: weren’t.  situation continues spiral control across country, Trump's numbers continue go down, I'm curious change response. Obviously gives fucks people dying, care reelection, continues, chances reelection going continue plummeting. Partly politicized, loudest message ignored science experts. rest case. economic fallout Great Depression didn’t even last generations. Nah.

All Asia disagrees Personally think California done decent job til now, careful numerical comparisons exponential growth, it'll extremely easy CA catch NY. think likely CA death toll exceeds NY long term due level complacency population reluctance lock again. love podcast much. Water wet, analysis shows pull data covid tracking get bear mind number positive tests constant. 1,000 critical patients might lead 50 positive 9,000 tests testing critical anymore testing lower percentage people getting 50 terribly unexpected. clothing industry got them. That's Chinese Connection Italy. 

Italy sources lot cloth China. Nah, old. I’m actually assuming California’s daily deaths double.  NJ NY closely interlinked economically, physically, socially (tons people NYC grew NJ family there) unsurprising infection curves basically went hand hand. also smart Cuomo leading regional approach NJ CT, lesser extent PA, many people travel them. Yes, depending job (that’s employer) might want sick notice 3rd day. 

Also it’s Problem go doctor. It’s like pay it. don’t understand many still mentioning “herd immunity” data showing antibodies last months possible get infected again. Research still out. definitive yet, since beginning felt immunity myth, especially mutated strain contagious, China freaked mutation found - could infect everyone recovered before.

I know... touchy subject believe get virus you’ll never get again... dealing much different monster here.

Can agree disagree let’s see data shows months.

I wish one done deal, don’t believe based mountain data studies I’ve plowed 5 months now. US locked fully enough. never nation wide lockdowns. US started easing lockdown still 20k new cases per day average. could done 2k new cases day.

In germany masks mandatory stores public transport introduced weeks lockdown. Outside people wearing masks to. yet covid hard. 

The US idiotic leadership lack compliance madse response catastrophic. worst yet come US. waiting while. clarified comment already someone else misunderstood me, that's say matter. mistaken virologists epidemiologists believe disease. Yeah, did.
But maybe could get back up.
The way things heading might much needed. Im pretty sure everyone knew lockdowns isolation key early on.  watched Italy China needed do. think that's valid excuse. New York shit job could learned Cuomo last person country lecturing another state COVID response. Usually hindsight 20/20 case foresight 20/20 still dropped ball. People way dumber originally thought Cuomo/Murphy 2020. Wait what. globally connected society, we’re going get something like First Plague Pandemic, marked relatively short outbreaks (under decade) specific cities slow spread cities. Limited trade mechanism ever spread pandemic generations. Elon tough employees companies ever. things. successful asshat looking change. 

That said certainly thinking. 

Since Tesla released parents. wonder hard would round fired disgruntled employees start worker owned electric car manufacturer? parents released helps r&amp;d. still tone engineering work design development industrialization. gives heads start. make business like work make worker owned treat workers right would huge. ideally take Tesla's designs make cheaper versions without bells whistles. Like electric car may need best ever every category needs practical affordable. even need compete Tesla keys face it. Tesla largely makes luxary vehicles. That's marker. Even cheap ones still cheaper luxary vehicles. 

Of course ramping something like takes huge amount capital investment. moved different state found quickly needed new state ID bars would let “no real state ID would good 44 years” need instances tickets health dept shutdowns liquor licenses revoked order people follow rules. happening, please, explain ideal scenario me. nailed it.

UIX people looking best way display information.

Take [this great example. tell raw numerical values gives context states trending.

They could done county map think would meaningful.  fly, make sure get respirator, fabric surgeon's mask.  Bible Belt gonna Bible Belt date person said ""medical team"" i'd bail. said ""medical team"" gave ""thumbs up"" Holy shit, talk lying statistics.

You write article economy even cite growth rate economy. Hmmm...I wonder might even dishonest, flat lying. rename sub ""LOL we're fucked""? I'm suggesting vaccine well tested completely safe, signifcant amount front end work done many vaccine candidates covid. designed based MERS SARS since they're corona viruses ""easy"" transition COVID-19. I've read. *yawn* Still rebuttal, huh? Obv. It’s dream city. seen many AZ papers don’t say name should. hope deep trouble dozens thousands lives could saved. Also thousand lives could saved future effing president would stop child wear fucking mask tell others so. Infuriating. Give two weeks fam, cases gonna start resolving you’re gonna start seeing death, unfortunately giant CDC meeting 2 years ago. Every state health authority representative major hospitals there. CDC sorta google drive share info states. email share advice warnings. CDC think it’s one simple important tools.

The Mississippi State health authority called using two years. lady head Mississippi state authority stood said cdc site worthless didn’t like it, 5 mins uncomfortable group grilling could explain bad parts ....she finally admitted said password (that made) hard, couldn’t figure out.

It password problem?? could easily reset.

This running Mississippi.

I’m highly skeptical Mississippi health informations accuracy believe it’s probably worse. Please stop proven theories. making look bad. /s Florida's main ""income"" comes tourists. tourist right mind would come Florida now? wants stand line Disney, Universal, etc .. ? lack leadership rehashing GOP talking points killing people spreading virus.

Answer - wearing mask invasion ""personal freedoms""? wear pants public, wear shirt/shoe's go stores. 

All non-mask people - sign waiver get virus, hospitals refuse treat save resources next person. Kudlow. guy said we've got mostly contained back Feb. want know fuck Tesla knows talking unions fire Holding #liberatewhatever rallies causing spikes, threatening state government guns, disgracing constitution country. Didn’t already take back down?  Nothing 100% safe - calculated risk

But low chance us infected (all us seldom leave home, wear masks, etc) , low chance outdoor spread (protests showed difficult spread outdoors, least summer, even lower chance proper distancing), low chance spreading via bathroom (few use it, space visits spray down)

I guarantee situation much safer people eating restaurant patio - want shut too? 

Again, find relatively safer ways engage - say nothing many people opt 'all', look got us. originally Pursuit Property, realized would perceived bad public changes pursuit happiness Amazing say unions problem billionaires pay taxes. one disputes closing earlier mistake... time largely flying blind b/c simply testing. went [13 cases 4-day period reported March shut-down 2 weeks later. Shit moving fast, feds fucked testing.

No doubt Cuomo/deBlasio pulled trigger week sooner, remotely comparable dereliction duty seeing governors. point either NY NYC disregard CDC guidance virus/risk.

edit: went ~30-40 deaths per day started shutdown, 300+ per day within week starting plateau 900+ 2 wks later. would want find would like without shutdown. Imagine thinking calling something Ponzi scheme backing argument needs rebuttal, pseudo intellectualism finest. yes, one knows, yes one knows when

the big question personally handle emotions coming bastardy Musk gotta tech bros stop slurping dick like ice cream hot summer day? Units, Units, massive crowd gathered beach, less six feet apart, shall send backup? article says two people terminated returning work HR attempted contact them, presumably ask they'd returning work. knows else went decision? Maybe already crappy employees.

The article said able prove consistent going communication managers returns work, maybe missed part white House cares voted Trump, rest country die. know sub partisan level-headed post buried way bottom thread. things never change seems, boy story tell that. lawyer actually reaches let know. got plenty testify myself. Looks like covid warming well, shouldn’t get downvoted stating opinion. don’t necessarily agree 100% doesn’t mean I’m downvote saying it, especially stating respectful articulate way. 

My counter point city population burn thing would areas got torched initially population takes way seriously southern states are. PPE distancing much higher said burned areas, it’s impossible really say that’s factor slowing areas currently form immunity due already largely exposed. Either way I’m gambling it, there’s much don’t know virus. cases people recovering catching COVID weeks even months later, different strains mutations *now* go whole get you’re immune thing. That’s well, aggressive contagious virus it’s possible even likely it’ll continue mutate it’s said done. Elon Musk sociopathic piece shit like vast majority CEOs large business owners world. Tipp, say sure sure 10% trailing 7 day average.

The buried data worse:

The 1 day Wednesday 15%. When? 2 weeks ago said wasn’t non affiliated scientists said ‘bollox’. liberals busy protesting crying. way spread disease all... race this? virus, care much melanin skin. legit everyone qualified unemployment Tell ""protestors"" also People like think India similar China huge populations that's literally it. That's it. Darwin also take immunocompromised everything keep getting naturally selected.   asthmatic nurse

Originally Chicago, I'm living UK seeing outsider's perspective makes sick. grandparents live Ft Myers family continually trying convince leave house. 

Thank you, keep fighting good fight. Yes, evaluations done eg help hospitals predict impact. 200k 4m factor 20, eg hospital says ""you get 200 4000 patients"". take lowest number, run risk lacking resources (same use average ~2000). Using 4000 means spending lot resources might need.


It's balancing act.


Now, maximum number evaluation (the upper limit) under-evaluation, planning window.


So faced unknown threat, think specialist explain context better, careful giving numbers. put focus protection/prevention. Would rather die good hair bad hair? Get real dude post 4 upvotes medical system collapses, death toll go roof non covid covid contributing cases Australia can’t give shit anymore cause COVID surge 33 cases caused second wave toilet paper doomsday stockpile prepping. Shelves empty low even state Victoria surge is. ""No one saw coming."" important note that, without federal aid, CA state facing tremendous budget deficit essentially forced decision reopening shutdown government. They'll get Meal Team 6 rookie numbers racket. Brazil cases/deaths = 1,192,000/53k

UK cases/deaths = 306,000/43k

""That shows still sickest tested widespread testing begun UK.""
See works? Lololol well addiction disease we’re treating COVID. I'm aerosol scientist guy know middle school called sheep believing COVID dangerous.

Yeah, common people accept uncertainty. Majority unaware analysis paralysis would like comfortably navigate black white decisions. Like works work, ""how likely work circumstances"". Like said I’m talking article title true. “we lose antibodies 3 months!!” stupid media kept reporting based single study 40 people. people going think vaccines corona don’t work. lot em refusing follow measures? That’s point, plus simply call illegal aliens criminals instead (which are) left still get angry. Plus arsonists shoplifters still legal citizens despite criminals. It’s hard concept. don’t mind immigrants all, that’s ancestors got here. It’s simply people disregard basic laws country people practically spit face actual immigrants get mad at. I'm really sorry, that's fucking horrible. Right Wing Conservative ""Christian"" Authoritarian regime White House country verge collapse...


Isn't Handmaidens Tale start? They're gonna tired winning government something stop protesting say "" Trump Hitler"" ""In America freedom"" 

STFU seriously 💀 Make america grave 💀 well,.for one, 'conspiracy theorists' right masks Deus Fauci saying need them. 

and right human huma transmission. 

and right along China's numbers

and American un huge denial. ... feel sorry good people abided rules good community. virus showed egotistical self centered people be. Yep, smug actually listening scientists needs done save lives. gone, troll Cant ready? Greatest number dead infected people think what's underrepresented unique nature virus itself. weirdest virus there, far unique hCoV. pathology, immunology &amp; pathogenesis strange quite complex. We've nonstop protest capital VA yet Rt keeps going down. People's wishful thinking got us first place. Wear mask. getting information subreddit, think four states country. Yeah, millionaire apartied South Africa. swear white people think everything self made, making own. could kid billionaire people would say “he worked hard!!” , “he own”. Welcome land exponential giving.... I’m North Alabama, dont list facility due social media rules. Don’t wanna get fired right now. Yeah reddit loves tesla hate hardon. told come back work. didn't. End story. like kind game chicken get see takes recalcitrant idiots wear mask. current surge due young people going bars (and beaches) etc know death rate steadily declined cases gone up. 

However, due Trump, supporters trend old, particular Florida imagine, issues wearing masks social distancing likewise young willing take much lower chances serious health consequences (and perhaps due politicians playing corona)

Eventually, due infected young, many wearing masks,it eventually/slowly spread demographics point they're going collective ""come Jesus"" moment a, ummm, lot literal come Jesus moments probably time watch respond daily basis.

It's essentially horrific self-imposed medical experiment lethal consequences brought political expediency taken often willingly people literally apparently stupid live care.

All vs wearing even light mask. Outdoor bbq style think another 60,000-person protest rally. pandemic really science-based, fact-based theory vs political public relations theory United States. Governor hill choose die seeing Governors picked hill now. friend twins o_o Check rule 4. Sadly, COVID-19 protection become political. One would think preventing death would bipartisan. Whatever, post fine news value, Good News tag questionable. Hurry cut testing already, ignore weird pneumonia symptoms death never understood seems like people actually no-call/no-show get reprimand slap wrist, they're harassing employee *wasn't* supposed work today covering. Makes sense. think people decent extrapolating guessing 250-300k. know models consistently underestimate.  last 3 quarters profitable. Granted, assume change end quarter, that's Covid. Porsche, Audi, Bentley, Bugatti, Lamborghini VW’s luxury brands. Yeah, state’s whole policy basically “people wear masks, we’re enforcing way cities/counties can’t enforce either” warning flag countries, like Italy Spain, started spiking. warning flag New York became hot spot. warning flag Abbott decided open state prematurely. signs along way, yet are. complete lack leadership disregard basic human decency safety. Ohhh careful now, you’ll disrupt Reddit circle jerk voicing opinion New rule.

Everyone doesn’t want wear mask needs sign waiver medical treatment duration pandemic. yeah platitude repeated ad nauseum people idea organizing actually entails. explicitly asked expansion responded another platitude lmao. people actually involved labor literally make fun people say ""organise"", actual meme.

It remains seen technical success actually help industry advance though. Cheaper satellite launches fine dandy, they'll need cheap enough allow space economy start up, grow, thrive self-sustaining, there's LOT things need happen that. bit state breakdown given society. Incredibly frustrating Hospitalizations according MSDJ website. reading Twitter person fired changing data whatever back supposedly saying they're going report consistent drop July 3rd 4th July holiday weekend impacted guess we'll start see whether that's true imagine comments written, author kicked back chair, smirked, thought much smarter reasonable common rabble, took long refreshing sip Mountain Dew martini glass. US hospitals also jotting deaths almost anything aslong virus person, blamed. hard literally compare anything statistics skewed around world. Like said, didn’t think came everything even really involved side Tesla. Anyway, googling wanted find actually come anything, stumbled across tried read it, bad didn’t make far, skimmed. I’m unfamiliar site, could written questions himself, knows. Wow, guy whole level egomaniac! re-integrated neighbor - families WFH. mom started posting facebook ""social distancing!"" kids sitting right next other...

Prior us talked it, risks could involve, thought OK. showing freaking clue. :-( Yep. here.  Asking Indoor outdoor? give *Trump* ego boost? don’t want either. time Americans stop murdering something else murders them. May odds ever favor day Walmart job ever quit without leaving sort notice. stopped showing one day. get exact amount respect showed keep wondering ""what's worst happen Trump wins?"" folks right now. fucking disaster getting started. Yeah, virus? went away Easter! ""Nobody could seen coming"" Good point. Though Ford partner EV charging network that's actually larger Tesla's network. think chargers fast superchargers still pretty fast.

A friend studied abroad Italy year. Flew back Chicago *fucking blown away* fat country is. totally forgotten. Still waiting pal literally doesn’t happen. story NY doctor lie. charting patients knew positive due presentation tested negative. referencing “undercover nurse video”, belongs jail due massive HIPPA violations literally lied misrepresented throughout. She’s investigation license revoked. tests horribly inaccurate multiple false negatives patients definitely covid positive. treat patient, test. We’ve dozens deaths unit know covid, recorded cardiac arrest due negative testing. know personally wrote death notes, took care patients. since Alabama posthumous testing since money. mean, go resort, masks. go here, masks everywhere. like, c'mon guys, over, know? Okay we're talking averages, average body temperature 98.6 rise +/- degree throughout day... [explains guess Usually there’s way like contact manager union one. Also they’re using email, employee able reply. not, that’s huge grounds getting sued. imagine it’d ridiculous form contact. Obviously everyone applies people anyone would previously suspected, expect. operational part sentence. rest window dressing.

Not rest sentence 

""because thats doing."" Yes. lack empathy understanding prompted comment first place. It’s just... adults would recognize bad thing. mostly deal people outgrown petulant “if don’t like don’t care” defense. get people life care you’ll figure out. I'm bay area located. Tesla KNOWN terrible place work. make good money overtime. anything except tow company line 110% totally agree management let go quick. Friends brother got fired asking change shifts wanted different schedule. Obviously that's second hand info I've heard lots similar stories. Exactly this. ""Despite wearing mask."" understand mask meant protect others him? seems basic me. 

Thanks goodness wore mask. already incubating, mask protected around him. get link? gotta mow afternoon sounds like good listen wonder people start taking pandemic seriously learn someone know passed away hospital. No, I'm saying molecules transmit odor smaller virus particle. data sourced state/county official sites, LA county site exact suspicious number it. said, seen one two mistakes Worldometers site number different source cited. case, check state website Worldometers lists. safe musk jobs market way, isnt people it. also accident. company planet fired them.

/r/shitamericanssay

The US span entire planet. I've never heard water meter inside unit. utility company access able read/repair meter. sure meter sure INSIDE house? “get fuck away me” ? Also remember someone gets sick Covid, don’t immediately need hospitalization. tends lag (two weeks?) cases get bad enough require hospital/ventilator. 

Seeing hospital system Florida decreasing hospitalizations Covid would reflective previous bad cases clearing increasing case counts means next weeks seeing number hospitalizations rise. hope overall proportion hospitalized/sick decreases reflect us better treatment. US anyone charge. Unions like charities. lot work impoverished (ie worker) spend money administration. Watch documentary, ""The Lottery."" teachers union great example terrible union US. Yeah weird, like 3 months since thing blew America we're already 125k, hell another three months we'll get half many deaths number cases exploding? 180k total seems extremely optimistic 180k seems like would right money. even actually smoke either! Like I'm gonna gatekeep someone smoking weed, Reddit fucking showered guy memes he's huge stoner take cheek puffs blunt.

Calling Elon Musk stoner like calling founder Tesla paid title. seems like government overreach.

It’s better think river keeps flowing. It’s going show wherever people infect. using Germany, China New Zealand examples. Could probably add Australia.

The whole wave scenario virus doesn’t fit way actually behaves. It’s like influenza pandemics. fuck OP felt necessary disparage Americans GLOBAL pandemic know.

anyone sitting america disparaging americans going on. folks still even wear mask crowded indoor area parts country virus taking off. wtf. 

folks want blame china covering up. attack critics president claiming would shut borders. etc, etc. hindsight stuff outbreak fault govt, simple shit mitigate extent coming. 

The virus going treat arizona different new jersey. mean placing blame current situation hyperbole ridiculous. C@pitali$m   Hm, family knows went down. anyone give Grammy hugs? initiate hugs? We’ll never know, I’ll reserve judgment one. 

When went elderly mother-in-law’s house pick equipment yard, would easy sneak hug. doesn’t socially distance family. told ahead visit socially distance everyone safety. 

It especially sucked dog passed away days before.. yeah, little cry car able offer comfort sad old lady. 

I hate virus, want go away. surely get down-voted, politicians are/were encouraging people go en mass protest? are, seen hypocritical. diabetes, What's point? comfortable exterminating people believe one people gets permanent damage. 

Also, they're ""fine"". Resurgence shown multiple areas thought they'd recovered. There's still vast amount people antibodies infected, appear immunity lasts long all. federal government doesn’t authority that, EU done well despite decisions made national level.

Having Montana full lockdown Houston serious outbreak silly. big problem unions type wage raises, maximum hours, mandatory benefits great, eventually get work quality, absenteeism, HR side it. Basically meaning hard discipline fire employees either terrible work, nothing job, even showing up.

That's true ""unions type"". Unions well integrated workplaces various Nordic countries, suffer nearly much level corruption happens US unions.

Of course, countries also already strong worker protection laws, there's actual negotiation takes place company unions. hate compare everything Trump he's human trashcan.

Elon Musk type trashcan. basic reproduction number exponential given enough time susceptible population. 

The coronavirus R0 like... 5 6. Even they're nurses see issue it? Employers already started report people unemployment office getting kicked work. everybody unemployed states got unemployment, especially FL. Ask health professional it’s better homeless health, since landlords started evictions process. People aren’t dying span week wear mask.   Iiiilli8o9i9li l p cat enough drama. can't see difference refraining bring yet new unasking people world, saving alrady here, serious mental health issues, man. majority people driven emotions comes forming opinions tend form single blanket opinion everything related said topic (eg Elon case). 

If they’re thread showing he’s scum bag business man, apparently everything he’s done life also worthless. they’ll use mental gymnastics justify opinion organization like Tesla, probably innovative exciting global company world right far products go, dumb pointless. 

It’s even debate. Like Elon not, company putting shit ton electric cars road, massive step right direction good environment. cancelled cybertruck order. also first humanity power wipe life earth mutually assured nuclear destruction, world stop kids moment dropped atom bomb.

Having kids scary. always scary. future scary. always scary. 

The future also full hope potential. children. few, said virus laying dormant never went away. happened aircraft carrier, also lady symptoms twice.

I'm saying cases result loss antibodies thus reinfection, I'm scientist. bringing sake discussion. OK, who's shocked Miss health official? horribly written article - address obvious question: mean 180,000 more, 180,000 total?

Not matters either way, really -- there's many unknowns estimate/projection shot dark. remember saying 60,000 total, 74,000 total. union employee really believe getting anything union, really need take vote leave union, first need ask accurate belief is. I'm currently union employee lot co-workers (especially newer ones) feel like union anything collect dues, totally ignoring everything they've already done. lot signed cards slightest idea like before. there, getting fucked.

In last years since voted unionize, starting pay increased 30% management longer terminate people whim. (At-will employment state, serious problem joined union.) Working conditions definitely improved able hire employees even workload. got annual boot allowance. went away small percentage annual cost living increase began negotiating yearly raises. Company 401K match remained 4% company tried reduce it. They've done way help us people realize.

The company bought back, new company's attendance policy, Vacation/Sick time policy, pretty much everything anti-worker gets. union, would lost 15 days vacation sick time. still ended losing 3 vacation days, that's lot better 3 weeks. course, nobody pays attention amount damage control Union pulled off, focus lost transition have. 

There's lots talk right voting union seriously realize we'll losing. union provides health coverage company option straight garbage, we'll lose that. Since we're right work state, protection wrongful termination window. Vacation time go toilet. Annual boot allowance, gone. list long can't remember top head, get I'm going. Like, really willing risk losing save 20 bucks month? I'm not. seriously icu right really similar thing happened Washington university St. Louis. custodial staff departments got letter saying furloughed 90 days 2 data later got termination letter Coupe two doors.

If we’re trying figure stimulus pay people’s $2000+ month mortgages $500+ month car payments, we’re attacking problem wrong way.

This always real concern Covid. symptoms think slight cough go business usual.

One figure heard somewhere districts face potential 20% tenanted properties impacted severe rental arrears — surely housing market couldn’t absorb level hit? doctor claimed viral power Covid-19 virus weakened time one cautioned national medical association. clearly outsider opinion reflect majority.

Anyways, fell radar GOP stopped pushing eventual nominee 2016. great video watch whole thing force you, trouble words mouth getting foamy. pretty bad.

Since started reading financial sections newspapers 80s, there’s always 2 figures reported GDP; official figure government gives out, closer real figure economists work given glean what’s happening inside China.  

Right start this, 14 people infected new coronavirus known travelled countries, epidemiologist maths calculate truer number number infected Chinese government giving time.  recall correctly epidemiologist said true number 15 times official number.  

No government right mind using CCP figures deal China, using Intelligence Academic resources make policy. clearly. Well research ... may like opinion put effort either way

I think Life goes beyond statistics though... Soliciting??

My gut feeling deaths probably start rise sometime next week probably get levels seen April (58857/30=1961.9 deaths/day) Wow that’s fucking Woody Allen shit. Nobody see future people adjust priors re: ratio daily new cases deaths. Hard imagine uptick deaths, Texas Florida 50% NY terms peak daily new confirmed cases, yet deaths remain flat 5-10% NY peak. speak swedish, certainly impossible - Spanish flu wave 2 killed way wave 1. 

&amp;#x200B;

Its definitely possible later fall neighbors need choose either 1) close economy 6 month, harmful 2) let virus spread winter/flu season, likely overwhelm hospitals cause excess deaths. don’t even know that’s fired. says that’s doesn’t mean it’s true. Gonna need source that. telling 20% positive cases need hospitalized? call bullshit. Give source owes job.

This big red herring issue discussed here. employer hires employee become subject state federal local laws statutes regulate employer's behavior work place. employees Tesla took unpaid leaves absence fired inappropriately false pretenses Tesla.

Nope, that's what's happening here. general expectation giant company thousands employees required follow labor laws, including recognition employee rights work place. right employee demand safe work place demand better pay. simple.

Of course simple situation red herring also strawman logical fallacy situation described nothing happened case. 

Everything simple design analogy make position many people employees entitled days mind numbing.

You understand people rights? people continue rights they're someone's employee? people work place rights? employers obligations statute certain things protect employees rights, right?

I think wait another month unequivocally declaring Cuomo handled well others didnt (not mention catastrophic nursing home decision). situation lot complex that. You’re telling sun hot? Consider mind blown...it makes sense. course so-called “solar power” industry behind this. bet COVID-19 hoax cover aren’t actually producing energy. bet glorified mirrors nothing blind planes. Spread word! looks like Karen Easy talk shit lack tests, medical equipment, knowledge, experience, ppe. 

Someone first, honestly even bad job considering against. Let's see Florida, California Texas play out. Look table section 2.4 here: see testing increasing cases found pretty stable prevalence positive cases declining slowly. 

They testing finding more. Unlike Sweden finding lot more. 40 times positives per test (12% tests vs. 0,3 % week 24). Sure, course. We're talking whole states though, difference isnt nearly large. 

That's also attributable forces outside control governors. [I gameble, Live with. Die with. Whatever. White House give fuck. get antibody test.

Secret service official != Government. (maybe unintentional) dig trump reducing testing secret service power test personelle, can't increase testing elsewhere, that's seperate set politics(though obviously ideally common sense(.   I'm kind confused articles saying vaccine going phase III would released October Dr. Fauci saying wont Vaccine til spring next year. 

What i'm thinking maybe vaccine batch coming October vulnerable people next year masses that's thoughts. :) anyone better idea whats going on? least antibodies tested for, B cell immunity maybe difficult test. make farty sounds armpit! virus decided nothing. people NYC took action, series hard actions, paid off. still deal economic hit, part cost action took flatten curve.

The protests outdoors wearing masks. Two factors help explain lack spike. something people could wear face help filter dust particles... Norway, Finland, Denmark one wears masks there... sure see correlation. Must factors involved masks alone. Italy we've spent like 2 months seing relatives.

Thanks clarifying. :) It’s funny party fighting tooth-and-nail legalization “Thr problem making crime it’s hard enforce” Texan voters elected Abbot really fucked too. Elections consequences voters get leaders deserve. 

I sympathize voters knew better didn’t vote fool. small range month now. Ohio started free inner city testing week. I've looking daily case numbers. seems like every site look says somthing different. accurate site? Yeah think 10 days average already adult patients Texas Children’s Volkswagen Polo pinnacle luxury vehicles That's ageist. old gods new? pretty typical tactics companies use terminate people, create situation terminate employee thats discrimination, Look excuse get rid employee. even user posting unreliable, coming KUOW, NPR's radio station WA. article authentic. want that, radio 96.9. NYC 30 40% cases, testing extremely limited time, people showing hospital tested. like, AZ Titanic, lookout see little bit ice sticking water, likely similar results.

NYC around 1% positivity right now, testing aggressively widely. Everyone Asia masks worn sick quite now. US zero culture it. Imagine people initial panic buying hoarding phase masks. seem like great move? 

The right answer US preparing producing masks distributing virus hit China even Italy. current administration incompetent. little late got here. 

I envy ability see everything black white, ignore context situations, whole heartedly believe opinion 100% correct. Lot less stressful trying tease nuance difficult situations difficult decisions. staying home socializing option. Even without cough, people cannot keep gathering like right now. folks understanding this? (m)any contact related spreads actually documented far I've seen. enclosed air space would definitely problem. talking close proximity would enough spread it, even coughing. concerned, consuming disaster porn. ok, human nature. 

if think houston next lombardy, going disappointed. Idk say it’s projection someone said “I’m going X” say “you’re X Y” absolutely zero actual basis thinking Y. reason you’d go you’re stuck mindset X can’t understand someone would X reason Y. Unless somehow explain knew person buying things companies couldn’t afford short comment replied six words to? *plenty* reasons people don’t buy companies can’t afford item, can’t think reason wouldn’t realize able see past experience play whole blood clots thing too? Didn’t already cancel elective surgeries? Damn, that's lot cops. mean. Okay. see point you’re trying make, you’re not, technically speaking, wrong...there human factor too.

120,000 120,000. come. That’s part focusing on. friends, families, coworkers, acquaintances. loved ones dying. something could stopped (or least SUBSTANTIALLY curbed slowed down.) Q1. That's January March. Sweden took almost measures March, others did. looking Q2 Q3 since linking economy impacted covid yet.

""Talk lying statistics!"" Except people above, become collateral damage people don't. I'm waiting Covid-19 test results, I've left house months I'm high-risk group, germaphobic husband service industry go back work weeks ago. wore mask, washed hands frequently vigorously, much good hardly customers wore masks. That's strong projection there, son. would like see Florida governor quoting scientists instead erroneous sayings. No, would work hygeine wear mask.

Brushing teeth washing mask much. cannot stand stink faces. Fatality rate may low seems, given huge gap year-over-year deaths period, accounting covid. Strokes, particularly among young people, happening much higher rate, thought connection COVID.  Tesla nut jobs accept reality. It’s damn cult.

Very odd similar trumplets musk cult is. He’s x cop  ever go look comment history ask comments double digit negative? Maybe means time think things. mean, unless living. showed true colours long pandemic, people want see excused it. Dating rule #1: Liars usually give many many almost silly detailed lies back lies. go hospital. set makeshift bed shortage doctors nurses care you. think better chance survival take care instead someone looks like might die anyway. can't wait Elon usual ""minecraft good"" everyone forget it. Report shit.

Echo chambers cancer social discourse. I'm starting see normal amount people stores, maybe 1 30 people wearing mask either... beginning V Vendetta? America hit hardest pandemic devolved failed state? may stupid question data contact tracing shows statistics getting virus social isolating following recommendations CDC, etc.? whole time we’ve luxury groceries delivered it’s gotten expensive going shopping food only, unnecessary visits stores. aren’t even seeing family. I’m worried contracting virus shopping likely masking up, washing ha frequently, etc. basically asking there’s way knowing majority people contract COVID following proper precautions (or healthcare workers constantly exposed)?, husband runner asthmatic two toddlers I’m sacrificial lamb going public. Thanks advance. Lol ignorance [long list court uphold health safety personal freedoms, local federal leaders choose exercise them. innumerate false precision state 6 digits. 2 digits probably reasonable. know start Tesla right? Nobody really knows. /s would say twice week schedule. Lots Americans vote him. Dude, that's fucked, im sorry man PErFECt StRategY, SOLelY bAseD PuRE SciENce. Trash cans actually useful though. He's human shitpile. Wave 2 going issue Denmark (or Norway), I'm sure. centralized health care systems roaring gear supressed first wave extremely well focused tracking new cases surpressing infection chains aggressively.

Currently, testing ramped 20.000+ tests day population 5,6 mio. capacity issue. Everybody order (time a) test online. contrast Sweden 20 new cases today, 1.600 yesterday fewer tests (absolutely relatively).

Test access tracking option early days first wave. centralized system people trust enormous advantage now. Due tax financed healthcare benefits really class poor working people would go work even feeling sick. Social distancing still even lockdown easing up. think Florida really choice. I've heard, pretty much entire economy tourism hospitality, shut they're risking pretty much total collapse. income virtually anybody, tax dollars state, God knows orangefaced dipshit going help out. I'm pro-mask fuck (50+ KN95s within six feet me), point. already CDC flip flop masks, need potentially bad data right wrong reason. convince anyone. Yep. Whatever happens plan. We’re living it. It’s scam able market autopilot tm Fucking imbeciles Okay. where's $498.6 billion? better classroom they’re forced wear mask (and listen classmates argue teacher it) stay facing forward assigned seat entire class? start worry? Since seem answers. okay people like you, become concerned verbalize it? Okay, cool, that’s I’ve making too. wasn’t sure special fabric people started using. Thank much!! 💕 No, stick bum. Hopefully non-covids going there. Hopefully... Maybe so, that's conversation led us. also important point, willing honestly analyze strategy, lose opportunity differentiate numbers strategy caused, numbers caused actions possibly countered poetic

Don't worry, understand. felt need vent getting downvote, yet want comment deleted. much time hands. That’s American Nah haha like soon get serious one I'll stop seeing swear. Can't put eggs one basket something 😂😂 Okay you’re saying none automakers egocentric narcissists near top companies??? heard really tasty wine ~$2. Unfortunately, state grocery stores can't sell wine, figured I'd put there, case someone know theory hold water. large protests Illinois, example, spike Illinois. due opening up, stopping social distancing, wearing masks (like Arizona - check - Texas - check - Florida - check). personally think changed tune hopes governor wouldn’t ban elective surgeries. Yeah can't really healthy economy workforce consumers sick. 

It's sort obvious lol. sick, neither shop work. achieve similar result morning November 4th.       
Maybe ""The Day After"" ways one. Soooo... Canada's border closed everyone US dual US/Canadian citizens exempt? It’s narrative much it’s exact opposite said yesterday. corporations telling workers form union, THAT'S need form Union!!! Please aware rights worker!!! fire retaliate talking wages/work conditions coworkers CLOCK, call NLRB they'll let know next steps. care controlling others feel superior. Humans cannot lockdown forever. wave hit Seattle, NYC, Chicago, etc earlier hitting NBD

Clearly nations handled pandemic well, like South Korea, Vietnam, New Zealand aren’t real. 

No big deal, right? government power unless given power federal state constitution.

The federal government claims power anything pertaining interstate trade. Pandemics affect trade, bam. authority. Whistle blow who?

There need Unions. can't Unions can't trust lazy workers, trust Managers, never make mistakes!  Autozone this. quit. matter dude, employee always right. Yeah, I’m saying LA county wasn’t hot spot initially weren’t sniffing other’s armpits way work every day Cleveland Ashtabula. wouldn’t happened southern states closed beginning too. took coordination, nope, would’ve easy. Seems like pretty straight forward reclaim Yeah.
This beginning nightmare. 1700 deaths New Jersey? reporting probable, check. bad. whole idea ""sick time"" sick ask me. fuck company regulate many days sick per year?

If sick, stay home get better avoid spreading disease. 

I really can't understand fuck Americans live like this? Hey, go yet. might good shit you. sub pro lockdown-forever.. one convincing people doom? provide statistical figures Great Depression mentioned now, refuse acknowledge it, lol. sheer ignorance stopped gas station town even employees wearing masks. speedway. cops pulled went inside get shit without wearing masks themselves. Word Oh shit! learned something, thank you. Wow puts things better perspective  Presidente mexico delegation flying commercial DC meet counterpart. direct flights, take connections layovers. 

sounds like bad idea time covid Seven days growth, red flag.

Eleven Days growth, red flag.

ICU beds 90% full, orange flag. 

With exponential growth would seem last orange flag going red shortly. suggesting people needing emergency beds sent home? 

You plenty masks hospital. Dying surrounded store rooms full PPE seems comforting that. say.(pay wall) NBA plans proceed even players test positive. MLB MLS. isolate positives carry on. suppose death cults religions. Seeing enormous jump daily deaths freaked min  That's POTUS it. whiplash change topic ok lot people come north south reopened. It’s fair anyone. understand rationale governors nothing hypocrites freaked states attempting them.  Vegas begging major tech hub; got ton infrastructure already casinos support industries, also miles empty fucking land expand housing business. 

It could like better, cheaper bay area. One coworkers huge biker guy proudly wearing “girliest” fabric patterns face masks I’ve made. rocks lavender polka dots! Fuck musk Tesla skirting laws safety ""Trickle Negligence"" It’s shame can’t build hospitals week like Chinese dumb bureaucrats regulations. Ohio? I'm Columbus, nexus this, still see pretty commonly I'm out. BLM protesters also really diligent masking. fairness, almost exclusively go need, like grocery store. even metro parks, maybe 30% people seem masked, mostly need there. said 9 days away 2 days ago. sad... 4 upvotes. seems right sub. fit narrative. mean come fuck on, dude.... sadly can't deny truth. people ignore terror attacks brown Muslims answer irrelevant shit.

I wish everyone could live peace possible races. can't mix everyone together like that. work shows everyday.

I want people Europe live peaceful life, 80 dead people France truck attack 20 dead children Manchester bombing (many examples could say) can't enjoy live anymore people still let everyone happen again. 

I want European lives eliminated one fucking cares. Another failure. 24 day old account...
Btw, claimed said fact, give source source?

You argument misinformation. 

Source please. RemindMe! 2 week Halts reopening


Reopening what? Everything's open like nothing ever happened month now. Lmfao... Hey give love Connecticut, right vs left issue, it’s wellness vs sickness issue. There’s absolutely reason make right left thing polarize everyone it, coming together working solution right now...not divided absolute absurd idiocy. 

Mask wearing political. People concern compassion others acting name safety political. Science data virus political. Transparency numbers cases, hospitalizations deaths political. can’t believe others actually taking stance politicizing global pandemic right thing do, dumbest thing imaginable could’ve done yet people still stick guns so. first sign things come:  revenue donations? God, federal govt know dead, hell know. paying 12 automated weekly monthly credit card payments services years I'm gone. so, wonder rope ""convenient"" method. Oh hey look! scripted response adds nothing conversation clearly attempt change subject! States lowered numbers control virus may need step help. still haven’t gotten mine. guess needed die get Stopping elective surgeries help this. surgeries require ICU bed unless goes wrong. WORDS ACCEPTED See honest people, I'd bet whole lot people blink eye scribbling back sending it. Northern Florida really southern Georgia. He’s probably turned mask horcrux already! remember when, bit, every article coronavirus would include stats annual flu last paragraph.

It's while. would thought killing people would bad econony? can't even get people take even basic precautions like wearing masks. politicians actively made situation worse one side tried politicize things like ""muh freedums"". Scandinavian banks done projections predict Norway Denmark better year Sweden.

Who knows, that's current estimate. Who's saying anything doom fetish? Seems like biases interpretations events. article TMC 100% capacity. That's it. op-ed Texas burning ground anything i.e. doom fetish making boogeyman. 

And guy felt necessary say ""relax..."" negative anyway. 

If want step back look objectively, numbers Texas rising. largest medical facility world's ICU hit capacity. Houston Methodist already 90%. Sure, 100% COVID issue if/when COVID ICU patients need room eventually tipping point Boom worried about. point they're close forced create make-shift surge ICU beds. 

None good news. Nobody saying panicked. However, point concerned. like boxy compact cars. like cars look like previous gen Leaf. actually pretty typical alot corporations. Firing something legitimate reason pretty hard prove targets part, unless rock solid evidence you, probably claim wrongful termination. companies high turnovers reason, cant afford someone staying 1+years, otherwise would pay benefits. Trickle baby! surgeries (unless go wrong extremely complicated) require ICU beds... young child (and adults unfortunately) cover eyes hands, believe whatever see gone. back jacking impending 10% mortality rate

Mature intelligent. wish well. return work order. thing staff want come back. ones, plan conjure doctors critical care nurses thin air? Yakima County WA running ""hospital space"" due staff shortage rather bed shortage. hate Fox News much rest you’re liar fishing karma. Anyone click site almost instantly see made up.

Thanks part problem, fuck now. Welp, coworker working week text he’s sick fever. He’s trying get COVID test. I’m getting one tomorrow. haven’t felt sick, last night strange pain chest, almost like tightness chest (never experienced tightness chest sure that’s call it). lot patrons already deterred point without mandate. think statement towards still going casinos. 

As I’ve seen reopening videos, there’s quite handful patrons (call ‘em will) without masks. mandate stop feet? think casinos might end hang free masks patrons point. Heck, read Caesars giving $20 patron mask recently. many also saying ""It's flu.""

Which, even true, would put situation could get flu? fighting normal bout flu great experience. TIL left-wing media type news-source bias one allowed have. point Houston going shut regardless. question whether government mandated people refusing go outside. outcome, one requires fewer graves. also means (if true) average case far less severe initially assumed, exponential growth cases would smaller impact hospitalizations.

Hmm. takeaway.

First, think always true. tracking January, China warned hospitals could easily get flooded lag time. 

But also know understand severity COVID-19 comes double lung pneumonia cases. good understanding case fatality rating disease state. 

We know little long term clinical outcomes cases originally classified mild infections. 

But emerging research, we're seeing even asymptomatic cases associated organ damage. know prevalent is.

How many people ultimately require dialysis, stents, transplants? many people heart attacks strokes? get you’re saying, agree Sheriffs enforce something like this. However, see they’re not. 

Marijuana still illegal. wearing face mask isn’t. It’d slippery slope, Sheriffs required uphold mandates Governors. 

I get it, it’s also incredibly stupid inconsiderate taking stance global pandemic. hit nail head. district survey. 43% parents willing send kids back. Smh Definitely, fines need publicized strictly enforced. Chicago pretty good job people masked doors experience, honestly totally sure city/state enforcing Miami-Dade leaning blue every election. older vote hard R, younger generations much likely vote D. people keep Rubio office northern counties, remarkably red. Appreciate response, hesitant respond quality post semantics. flies carry? Disease! WANT DISEASE!? That's stopped Elon fan. Previously knew shitty person overall companies good things world. know he's piece shit entirely outdated told OP continue smoking pot even though increases risk COVID complications?  saw comment could tell main interest smoking pot. kind succubus sub? right sub this, anyone think truth reconciliation project could work America? mean, we'd agree truth first.  attest ONE wears fucking masks work. Sounding DFW

I don’t want fucking COVID cooties

I always masked up. Idk people see crowding restaraunts, bars, wearing masks look average TikTok user hate can't make political posts sub. become abundantly clear response covid become purely political able talk that. Yay!
Our government continues fuck us ass. good leadership breeds loyalty. give workers reason loyal abandon moment's notice. get paid enough 5 days last 7. can’t get paid enough 4 days last 7? time 3 day weekend.  I’m Cleveland Lorain quite bit, many people actually give dirty looks wear mask. Many food service employees (except local Taco Bell surprisingly) masks around chins nose mouth. would say 30-35% people wear masks public I’ve seen past three weeks. It’s common perception either sheep wearing masks masks completely ineffective curbing infection rates. see happened Memorial Day? Smh. Extra beds extra icu trained staff help patients? bed doesn’t shit don’t nurse staff jfc. Mary Antoinette popped mind. wonder why? it’s undisclosed location? Sure guess people could find starts spam social media can’t stop idiots like that. least won’t near craziness typically is. Great... Thanks agreeing First far universally accepted conclusion. Sweden's economy actually grew last quarter expected better neighbors. [1]

Second, matter Sweden's internal policies, going take massive hit unfolding worldwide depression exports sectors economy get battered.

[1] would logically follow even less deadly. late now, right. correct answer. Declare federal emergency. president gives Oval Office address saying, ""There way sugar coat this. going rough period. experts agree need do. country needs right now."" Nationwide lockdown. Seal borders. Mandatory masks necessary trips outside home. Compensate people businesses duration. would *really* sucked...for four six weeks. would over. Sounds like they're refusing jobs. Critiques people like Osterholm exactly kind critiques I'm referring well informed rational. comment intended directed people like who, expert, trying make sense complicated world geopolitics epidemiology. certainly inefficiencies WHO. often target criticisms past.

But much I've read pertains anti-WHO sentiment reddit last number months, particularly issues surrounding Taiwan, flat wrong. much politicized, particularly Taiwan USA. sound like young, stupid. wish well. NY shut late. virus already realized it. Plus, NYC immensely denser Sweden. consequences voters get leaders deserve.

Sort of. 

The people California want things reopen fully, Newsome anyway small number right-wing mutineers wanting deal governor Michigan dealt with. 

The voters California support deserve this. People world, think UK handling Coronavirus? realize 100% fatality rate right? Even comorbitys higher chance surviving dying. know 6+ people it. describe like head cold. Without care, deaths probably higher rate placed pneumonia pile instead COVID. No..are u new reddit... stated fact.. need refute  grandfather got joint check included grandmother, passed away last summer. bank would deposit due way written (it needed signatures) send back. never received another check right information. Ha funny cause everything else digital SO's paper ever reason. lot great ideas future, proving people's wellbeing non-factor vision. fair, work.

Tesla Elon remembered. They're remembered first relevant ones, *first* first, first *working* alternative energy.. uh, conglomerate, thing. honestly shows Nobody saying personally it.

Typical Redditor, arguing nothing. wanna see Dr. Fauci skinny-cut jeans lip-synching Justin Bieber. Make shit happen, it‘s 2020, anything goes went shitter prety quick.  X catches it, comes home infects everyone household, blame? this, play number games. 

There 328 million Americans (rounding down). takes 80% population antibodies reach herd immunity. 80% 328,000,000 190,400,000 people. We’d need least 190,400,000 Americans catch COVID start begin hope herd immunity. 

Really, it’ll higher death rate .6% take people herd, let’s pretend 190,400,000 infections, reach herd immunity. 

With death rate .6%, group 190,400,000... approximately 1,142,400 die. Really, that, rounding down. 

If 328,200,000 Americans caught COVID, approximately 1,969,200 Americans die. 

This kills see people say death rate “only like .5%.” .5% US population refers million people. far protests led spikes. Outside. UV light. people wearing masks. 

Compare full restaurants bars without masks. That's hotspots are. could effect they’ve never exposed? Death rate spike enormously ICU capacities maxed out. one, everybody needing ICU able get one anymore. Also imagine work, imagine workload constantly 130% everything taken care of. We'll, situation medical staff scenario. triage hand due anymore free ICU, top ICU full, ICU usually top that. quality care drop mistakes made. addition nearly unavoidable medical staff get sich ultimately cases take despite capacity handle less staff.

Thats drove mortality Italy, NYC, Spain... Plus side property taxes lower think everyone take many precautions can. someone cough 8 months straight least 3 years, understand could dismiss something consistent like that.

Ive seen doctors years answer solution. 

Here's another source. Basically sent letter yesterday interpreted extremely dire, goal letter encourage distancing, masks etc, scare public. backtrack appears say capacity getting thinner, plans place handle it. 20x Step 1: get covid

Step 2: rack huge medical bill

Step 3: die

Step 4: medical bills written off

Step 5: profit post death stimulus cheque We’re Götterdämmerung phase Trump Presidency. loses let country burn spite rejecting him. Must exceptionally healthy person even make 114. fair, also sometimes happens laws *actual* bullshit, we're grateful it. Unfortunately goes ways everyone different idea bullshit. Lowe’s sucks monkey butt Well could start working staff provide safe working conditions.

That’s solving problem presented. collecting partial unemployment reduced hours. Bet company tell option. 

I actually can’t. purposely didn’t say details arrangement, already assumed worst possible interpretation employer evil corporation here. Nice see you’re arguing bad faith. Hmm kind sounds like unions formed first place government stepped mandate workplace protections now.

The irony (which hilarious) argument work **for government**. wouldn’t fit narrative, would it?


Look, I’m way defending Tesla arguing them. **all I’m saying is, stop trying judge employers one scope. unprecedented time employers different abilities disposal**

**this multi variable problem. Stop judging it’s binary**. Omg made mistake downloading app watching video... Fucking. Stupid. brain never recover cringe, mean 99% videos.
Even educational ones stupid gives fuck. country crisis incompetent, evil person office. many people end ICU elective surgeries? Rss took funds ISI invited Pathankot air base... That's fact conspiracy want know there’s podcast episode shitty justice? Trump Administration responsible deaths hundred thousand Americans. criminal would go jail this? Shit like happens China time prioritize quick construction health safety. regulations prevent shit like happening extent possible. walking what, people get fired every day. go Elon Musk media day. Without assurance immunity, matter? sick enough consume scarce resources issue. China? That's I'm saying. ""remind me"" used whenever someone said Covid19 hoax. wanna see anyone used ""remind me"" reminded. confusing people approving Newsome's handling want asked reopening. Chalk neglagence show door No. serious? entitled cynical, yes. also seem think loan like free money. someone loans $1M, means owe someone $1M plus interest. might capital need start business, little starting profitable business. called story ego let come hill made stand Oh 'thanks'!

(Finally someone got joke. lot downvotes lol.) little people don’t matter, don’t know? they’re hurting cause isolating! /s Even so, employees work notoriously long stressful hours would likely higher risk result. gather close quarters work increases odds virus spreading, including vulnerable people. Quarantines lockdowns work start making exceptions everyone business owner wants stock go back up. Agreed someone's gotta sort dream let's fair. 


I seen anxious people take alarm irrational heights (and tried talk down). Due multiple failures, long haul. would hard psychologically unhealthy avoid meeting anybody 2-3 years. yes, people letting alarm carry things away. Also yes, gathering creates risk. can't pretend none. 


**I consistently seen 2-4 people spout ""doomers suck""** cliches many posts sub. Half million dead. easily approaching million dead end next month. anything seems irrational period history, people equate end lockdowns end social distancing. people waste time minimizing true crisis. 



Risk assessment calls weighing risks values. let's pretend people logical. people are, end day, social animals take risks perhaps scientifically necessary. seems overall, people right wrong. expand conversation, literally explain another poster sensitivity use word little attention Rohingyans gotten Hey. I'm fellow gamer (hence tag). sucked last quarter year?  like - normally I'm chomping bit get tore serious game time. Nowadays? There's joy it.....can't even bothered finish game I'm halfway thought awesome last year. 

Fuck 2020. conflating things, like many others get called out. I'm arguing state Texas - agree serious. original commenter's issue, mine, sub comments. commenters look like group people trying make terrified, or, taking type weird enjoyment it. think comments trend towards absurd, fundamental disagreement constitutes self induced panic. Ok read article conservative friends back. Gotcha Maybe call grandparents share concerns, see risk tolerance/preference is? decide go, try keep interactions grandparents outdoors much possible, keep physical distance conversations, must indoors room, keep brief, keep windows open, keep far possible, wear mask must speak them, studies indicate speaking generate almost much droplets coughing. Good luck everyone involved. 

Jan 24, Day bought masks Amazon. Westerners still singing flu song. expect he's also enormous amount pressure reopen business interests may factor ignoring guidelines. Even takes 2 years? Make mask piece electrostatic HVAC filter. long form fitting (you'll need piece metal nose) seal around edge tight, protect getting virus (as long kind eye protection too). You’ll fine. Grandma toast, though. shit starts hitting fan. lockdowns flattening curve supposed prevent. opened soon, and/or wasted time bought squabbling fucking whether idiots wear masks instead actually preparing handle pandemic. Lol true statement Americans society *long* history prioritizing ""personal freedom"" objective greater good. Basically would rather face kinds dire consequences somebody else tell us can't do. 

Look examples like gun control. country refuse trade even smallest impediment gun ownership saving lives mass shooting school shooting victims.

Similarly refuse put health safety Americans profit motives private businesses regard environmental regulations cleaner air, better fuel standards, cleaner water, lower CO2 emissions. Ditto healthcare. 

We can't even agree strategies reduce waste like plastic bag bans mandatory recycling programs. Actually governor required face masks state California. I’m surprised (and relieved) people taking seriously. outcomes infections random. way dice roll. game; reality. cashed? ask editorial someone thinks Newsom wrong.

I asked citation "" people California want things reopen fully,""

As two weeks editorial printed, 69% Californians polled approved Newsom's handling coronavirus would directly contradict assertion. California particularly close ""fully reopened."" fraction public businesses allowed reopen, open open restrictions that, read them, logical science-based reasoning behind them. link work me(UK), says permission view page, region locked? 'Congratulations'. impossible. virus plan best approach long term sustainability deciding mutate. mutation occurs coincidentally makes super contagious deadly beyond 5% Dr could theory happen. kills efficiently many waves, instead killing lot host initial outbreak, many little would able even able catch again. deadly sure aftermath health issues survivors would worse too. bad prepared bet one twice deadly everything else (and impossible think could happen again) would twice many dead looking struggled one already. leaders seriously get rushing everything forward like nothing’s wrong bringing healthcare system brink overwhelmed actually economic damage long term?

Doesn't seem like it. They're dumb. FYI morbidities counted Covid deaths now, know speaking without citing sources. Green Lantern it?  I’m Baltimore, MD, want say proud city average person’s precaution. partner recently visited Savannah see mother sister. appalled area’s complete lack social distancing/mask-wearing. 

People packed restaurants. people (other servers) wore masks. returned, knowing risk potential exposure, self-quarantined, even me. 

My brother psychiatrist Texas. reports even hospital administration’s lack concern matter horrifying. grown Texas, embarrassed. Hopkins reported 5000 new Covid cases Texas Jun 23. 

In Texas kind cowboy anti-establishment culture actually quite charming different circumstances. However, think mistrust government led populace take guidance seriously, fear almost like rebellious 16-year-old, lesson may learned hard way. ICUs 3% tens thousands cases? Yes, specifically COVID19 good news. watch 2016 election? we're buckets. there's much water buckets have. Lol! already has.. one office assistants work tried that. wife told pull stupid mask up. 

Wife doesn’t want building, she’s decided pain ass. Good. Downvotes defense. get it, disgusting apologist. How's boot taste? He's still million times useful society ever be. likes Trump (the guy also times successful you) mean worth respect. Learn respect people better you. That's I'm taking voluntary lay offs. Company might use justify actual lay offs. ""Well obviously NEED work they're willingly staying home"". See hell, ya lazy bastards. I'll gladly take promotions. least two North Carolina sheriffs want people die. Yeah saw numbers today dumbfounded. Idiots technically, getting nearer peak everyday, matter happens. anything question?

I asked whether endorsed mother's opinion. That's asked. answer that. reason refuse answer that? 

Back december came werid cold days walking past group people, one wearing mask.

It like normal cold nose elements werid tiredness it, combined lessening reaction time awareness.

I believe COVID-19 theory called 'Jet-Theory' theory based commerical airlines operate, many commercial flights airborne, virus existed since least October-November 2019

All commerical jets use bleed air engines air con cabin pressure, combine many passengers large airliner accomodate, makes perfect breeding ground virus, even worse ships, get fresh sea air those, airplanes, air recycled.

Then realise commerical airlines operate, take off, bring passengers one location, disembark board, refuel, rinse repeat, virus spread plane also stops plane made, next person getting plane would contract using flight entertainment systems, recycled air, virus could even spread cockpit, contaminating controls infectring pilot pilot, pilots fly mutiple aircraft could even contaminated mutiple planes airlines fleet, spread air, airliners basically ran stop back then, plane would ground hours most

Even private pilots light aircraft could contributed.

Imagine thousands times, look flight radar late 2019, doubt speed air travel biggest cause.

It's easy say that, virus everywhere middle December January  already happened Illinois, hospitals safely running something like 130 percent capacity Again, fully understand you’re saying. identifying temporary peaks. You’re bit caught semantics, real issue close hitting new high US (regardless want call it). Well cases news people vocal conditions there.
And vocal wanting form unions 

And I’m sure non publicized ones tatted suck ball coworkers posing trustworthy. one constant contact management. keep glossing that? Love proactive attitude.

/s  elon musk overrated fucking douche nozzle. I've saying years years. amazing see statement highly upped Reddit. crazy times. Uh oh... Trump's gonna mad him. enough people dying. Serious question... I'm looking links, say looks right... look trend:

I see new talking points distributed. print another trillion send everyone. 🤷‍♂️ world anything china building makeshift hospitals?

A hotel collapsed. served quarantine hotel like many others China, wasnt makeshift hospital, Building working hotel years forget ""it's testing""....

I can't believe people dumb enough think rising hospitalization rates due testing. 

This whole pandemic shown absolutely stupid people be. everyone ignoring death rate? virus mutating getting less less lethal, one talking that. There’s 85 hospitals Houston. 21 TMC.

What’s capacity 64 hospitals?

How many % COVID patients? I’ve read around 12% article two days ago. mean isn’t good news all, don’t think alone paints clear picture. support Tik Tok. support TiK ToK Kesha. that's impolite, asking valid source impolite who's dictionary?  way

Hard stop. think misinformed sub place share expanded understanding. 

First, true aerosols created large quantities specific medical procedures. evidence clear that.

It's important remember that's *only* way they're created. Here's [example aerosol generation speech. go quite bit detail emission rate affected phonetics amplitude. husbands family throwing surprise 60th birthday party aunt next week. really trying get us come, budging. why.

I’m planning much anything except listen neighborhood set illegal fireworks. Oh thank god. took 120,000 corpses reality forced away party line. 

Men. Of. Character. unconstitutional restrict travel unconstitutional require quarantine upon arrival. I'm stunned that.

Why consumed presuming know people think? This. Florida Arizona would disagree Still cure stupidity/texas would properly dealing pandemic result less popularity? 

Obama's administration prepared volumes guides handling pandemic, realizing one way already. Trump disbanded task force disregarded manuals. Wuhan locked ten weeks. Yeah emphasizing zero people wearing masks reality LITERALLY millions people wearing them, dumbass. Thank Better three months late never? likely take months, longer, American tourists allowed Europe anyway. contrast, Canada us can't work getting $2k month since March (total amount $12k still can't return work).

We went lockdown hard starting reopen heavy measures including requiring masks many cities.

We're watching guys morbid fascination growing thankfulness government takes seriously.

We're running huge deficit, we're scared us loved ones going die. Easy trade-off. Abbott, they're same. 3 types people:

1) People think basically flu

2) People think lockdown forever leaving house makes murderer

Got it.  totally agree political States. 100%.

Where else would wearing mask become sign political party support? shame America split party lines this, governors wanted sensible, strict lockdowns disrespected President, encouraged protests supporters Wall Street could recover quickly.

Test, trace, isolate proven way deal this. correct. time President railing it, never going get better.

This virus going away time soon. lots people seem get it, look rest America business usual people refusing another shutdown.

People need keep mind get together anyone outside household, also sharing germs people they’ve contact previous two weeks. You’re choosing misread I’ve written. Good luck beliefs. Bring argument, emotion means nothing anybody. 'recovered' 'virus'. model swings wildly. June 15th, projecting 200K deaths Oct 1st. we've much good news since then.

In end must done. knows right yet act. People die. negligent mandating masks public accommodations enforcing fines suspensions licenses point. We're talking saving tens thousands lives here. arrived close figure (1-3 million dead US worst case scenario everyone infected).

But Americans Americans, even death toll enough guarantee they'll take COVID-19 seriously.

People take COVID-19 seriously affects inner circle. inner circle likely less 100 people - probably less 50. 3 million dead, that's 1 100 Americans.

Sad say, people wearing masks likely change ways guy end neighborhood block dies COVID-19. 


There's decent chance typical American's inner circle see COVID-19-related death even everyone infected, way disease struck past months, means us might make without losing family member, people lose entire families thing. Shave off. Buy clipper it. EXPENTIAL GROWTH looks like.

after slow start numbers start compound point doubling every 2 days.

Texas slow start, geographically isolated , low density, particular vector say like Cali China NY Europe. got little scary beginning Gov. shut down. mainstream Gov's time.

So numbers Memorial day pretty good. gov relented , reason easy imagine, people acted like never CV virus. took month get now. That's exponential growth. happens media health officials say OK protest. Even less worry death rate continue plummet, even case numbers increasing.  experience growing siblings. Maybe eat it? Somebody check that. Yes, lot PPE US stockpile expired pandemic, replenished right away like been.

That's rotate stock. Send expired PPE hospitals need (maybe sell reduced price), buy new goods stockpile.

#Translation: 

The Stockholm Director Health Björn Eriksson argued prioritization [triage] needed. raises lack space occur hospitals - prioritization may needed.

Eriksson several occasions stated prioritization necessary vacancies throughout pandemic. doctors testify opposite - prioritizations tougher usual made.

In e-mail DN, Björn Eriksson refers document region developed aid communication consultant support priorities intensive care, Inspection Health Care, Ivo, started examination this. 

He emphasizes lack care arise all:

“Local regional situations may arise need greater availability intensive care units. cases, priorities may applied accordance National Board Health's ""National principles prioritization intensive care extraordinary circumstances"".

He also states Ecmo - advanced treatment blood oxygenated artificially outside body - form care exists Karolinska therefore example local deficiency occur. 

“Each individual caregiver responsible following focus intensive care priorities. always clear intensive care tough treatment. always requires medical assessment patient benefits receiving care treatments judged better individual patient. assessments take place time covid-19 pandemic ”.

“However, prioritizations exist long vacant intensive care places. doctor DN spoke with, near quadrupling done intensive care capacity partly done expense staff density. **The number employees per patient normal intensive care performed premises normally used intensive care**,” writes Björn Eriksson. 


When comes question reporting shortage space chimera characterized culture silence, Health Director responds full confidence hospitals prepared ready many intensive care centers reported several times daily regional health management. 

“If culture silence department health care providers, strictly culture encourage. good non-conformity reporting errors occur jointly improve develop care. normal conditions covid-19 pandemic”, writes Björn Eriksson. 

Johan Bratt, chief medical officer region, refers document priorities email DN.

“Ecmo form care exists Karolinska University Hospital Solna places care. example local shortage occur. First foremost, healthcare tries find similar care elsewhere, may also arise situations prioritization must take place, operations must follow National Board Health's principles prioritization”.

Each individual health care provider responsible following focus intensive care priorities, Bratt emphasizes. 

“We always clear intensive care tough treatment. always requires medical assessment patient benefits receiving care treatments judged better individual patient. medical assessments happening time covid-19 pandemic,” writes, continuing:

 “I aware types medical assessments always occur occur good patient. However, priorities exist long vacant intensive care places. doctor DN spoke with, near quadruple done intensive care capacity partly done expense staff density. number employees per patient normal intensive care performed premises normally used intensive care ”.

 Bratt states full confidence region's hospitals.

“IF culture silence department healthcare providers, strictly culture encourage. good non-conformity reporting errors occur jointly improve develop care. normal conditions covid-19 pandemic ”. lol reddit full trolls morons love it.

Why think doctors nurses wear masks?

Cause look cool?

Why people prefer sneeze tissue instead directly another person's eye?

LOL people mask argument exposing 
A) Trolls 

B) Cretins lowest order 

or C) want watch world burn people die.

None good. another 728,000 claims pandemic unemployment assistance another week 2+ million state federal claims emotion? Lol amusement. Crazy people still seem think affect actions, eh? Like dude's friends going home infecting grandma absolutely nothing encouraging said friends gather infect other. put nails street - could possibly guess people would drive them? Fucking morons. Wtf.. people *literally commenting thread* without shred irony plan hold “milestone birthday” party kid grandparents invited. it’s “ok”, try wear masks “when distancing isn’t possible”. Idiots continue idiots, *even* reading story. Brazil, among others. Maybe fraction point.

The grim estimates predicting 1% population dying amount much terms changes average IQ.

Also, one consider lot smart people also dying thing nature work makeup inner circle (ie. doctors, nurses, smart people stupid family members, etc.) also ignore treadmills salads, adds looming disaster bills primary intended purpose funds

And guidelines told primary purpose funds?

Or make argue needlessly? favorite thing even tho masks “mandatory” NC, literally said going enforce it; people didn’t wear mask start going wear one now. Whoops? sister who’s fighting cancer?! word. seems like chronic cough dusty job something still read room dude isn’t time guessing dry cough means around elderly parents cancer patient sister. Jesus. Right, like New Zealand, South Korea, Australia, etc. exactly purport impossible. people stupid? Tesla must really mad grave Elon using lastname shitty company. one? virtually major innovation occurs US? Feel free enlighten major technological revolution occurred outside US last 100 years.

Hi, Canadian here. us apathetic ignorant. Piss off, eh? C'mon Texas, measly 1,000 away beating Russia! C'mon now! Get Russkies! Ghyeu ghue ghue!

Ahhh, messin' ya Texas. Stay safe. It’s back usual September though? dow futures right New Yorker here. can't help chuckle state rest country right now. Especially transmission rates make clear people wearing masks. 

Even massive protests ongoing, large increase cases here, definitely would've seen now. mean... exactly hospital workers supposed get work? know told average person 20% chance death it, KNOW 90% people would mask up.

Its selfishness.

Arguing efficacy masks like arguing underwear doesnt keep cock flailing around walk. government could put millions work mask enforcement. Give em Super Soaker filled cat piss deter offenders. He’s trying mask order month. keeps getting struck down. He’s also trying slow reopening economy. Harris County. Harris county stay-at-home order Abbott another Abbott started opening (through end may) deemed void Abbott told everyone could ignore it. temporary icus field hospitals, redirecting new patients, transferring patients closes hospitals nearby, gets way bad, people getting back tagged and/or dying hallways. Hey, crisis, dumb people another reason inferior - possible permanent damage bodies. Summer classroom teaching going weeks Sebring Florida SFCC. Cafeteria open too. Nevada hard case considering biggest employer MGM half sates relies casino industry. dont even collect income taxes casinos support large part economy. sound like conservative talking policing black communities. Yup. Pretty sad likely going gym anytime soon extra happy bought much workout equipment back march! Dr. Oz getting facts from? Take grain salt. Everything west Urals Europe  Think perfect environment spreading death pandemic ... would casino. *“The usual excuse men visiting room salons ‘just there’ went ‘someone else paid’. people buying excuse more.”*

Honey swear, idea... I’m mass even though cases going still wouldn’t this. That’s “second wave” could start. need keep steady summer prevent another continued shit show fall. Absolutely! biggest problem that, friend girlfriend roommates. one person, 6 total. point, there's much potential community spread one house, want one give either. I've skipped family reunion upcoming beach trip. think I'm taking seriously. I'd devastated accidentally infected family, I'm terrified would infect (which likelier scenario). say freedom come cost. fact, said opposite, price pay live free society. I'd argue price worth paying. Europe lucky benefit dynamism innovation without make sacrifices do. world lucky us shouldering burden. Title maybe say 65% americans tested? Obviously 100% population survey, maybe im nitpicking think important talking percentages easily used mislead Michigan can’t believe numbers dropping soon stay home orders diminished month ago social media feeds full photos people traveling partying across state together least liberties weren’t violated teacher friend mine said would rather go pure online try make online + person work simultaneously... easy solution Except protection infusion months ago would unreliable, gone, now. also urgent, there's reason risk trip hospital getting leaked could Oval. 

It's likely least one mild stroke needed full hospital's resources available determined extent. We're pretty desensitized antics being... unfiltered, seems like there's ""some good days, bad days"" aspect faculties. people can't truly internalise risk unless first hand experience it. like telling child who's never burned touch hot iron, idea risk except told. Lots kids touch iron anyway. 

As adults learn listen safety advice lessons learn touching hot iron even told to. covid highly politicised America people ignore warnings got members ""tribe"" telling risks real stated.

Thankfully phenomenon goes ways. finally impacts personally lizard brain kick tell danger real. instincts friend foe comes dealing something like this. honestly believe people lost focus. safe hospitals N95 masks, shoulder shoulder makeshift mask chanting reform somehow make immune. BLM protests, rural people protesting reopen, parties Ozarks, every single person thinks they're exception. Stay inside unless absolutely necessary sound judgement work basically undone. going another shutdown people going die become immune. defining everything racism dude. people making reasonable discussion impossible pushing us closer violence.

-- you, apparently threatening violence lumped racists Texas muh freedom. free country whatever want, that's why! /s 

People take freedom wayy literally country. like yeah, free country extent whatever want without consequence. would also point people concerned ""me"" rather ""we"". military told get mindset ""we instead me"". means focusing team's need instead own. Tried plead wife's family wear masks. told nothing create breading ground bacteria around face. firmly believe Covid hyped media bad massive conspiracy play. rise getting trounced like NYC. Can't say treatment better, worst strains died out, weather (or those). Yes, EU banning tourists multiple hot spot countries. Surprise! doubt staying away others best. efficacy masks, particularly cloth masks, still relatively new subject comes pandemic response. Physical distance well established non-pharmaceutical intervention plenty supporting evidence. good idea wear mask go public there's doubt effective, distance masks. Distance wins hands down. Dumb mfs Obese, diabetic, hypertensive middle aged male female Karen's United States care virus rude awaking. Black Lives Matter protests shifted media attention states beginning open up, covid basically dead water media. Americans slaves news cycle, focusing miss rona, American attitude generally seems pandemic over. ...what shock. live Wisconsin, Milwaukee. People wearing masks, gloves, anything. elderly lady works nearby church one people know wear mask people constantly coming going office, seeing saying: ""Oh, need wear account, I'm perfectly safe!"" stares them.

I feel terrible elders, *too many irresponsible children running around bodies adults days. killing us.* People need also understanding almost every testing site running tests noon. numbers severely underestimated. Well America fattest sure people around brain. use display MAGA hats Great comment, thanks. work Oklahoma cases spiking, asked job couple days ago could stay home like April.

They flat told can't even take unpaid time stay home pandemic.

So much everyone saying choose stay home want to. Fascist pig, tourists marginalized discriminated too???? doesnt help medical professionals wear them? 


You're making sound like masks useless lockdowns effective. I'll estimate 200k mid August could try, shuffled people around NYC NJ, easy, compounds distance. first thing would probably direct new patients there, could lead fun multihour trips get ICU space. Well know put light body disinfect, according president reason work keep sick people spreading germs far. room sick person wearing mask healthy person wearing mask, sick (absent n95 proper procedures describe). sick person wears mask, far likely spread germs other, mask not. fine fuck worth posting wtf wrong sub "" claims went higher expected, least 20 million!!"" interesting see markets today, I'll kitchen making popcorn. rest 2 years old  Lead Paragraphs:

Bad message top make damned fine mess 19.5 million still unemployed receiving unemployment benefits. learned protocol SARS / MERS data outbreak, plan, enacted plan minimize risk allow work proceed.

It's opposite US handled it. organized plan, changing protocols, ignored suppressed data. End result US fire economy impacted many months.

Lack leadership kills... would affect new cases, deaths.

I theory. Vitamin deficiency associated severe respiratory illnesses, including COVID-19. think Sweden benefiting far North right now, general people get sick Northern hemisphere better people get sick six months.

I think we'll see deaths South Africa, Argentina, Chile tick around September/October, death rate US places increase next January/February. recipe disaster. People already unemployed. $1200 check going nothing. rents least half check.

Somehow West got stuck either ""let's lockdown stay home much possible months"" ""if locking down, I'm going bother masks."" places prove (objectively, absolute numbers) middle-ground could worked. Instead, two extremes. really boils Musk dick core being. Australia police border crossings literally turning people away. Sure, people might get many. saying immigrants usual now, due highly effective wall? still reckless decision, reopen tourism make masks mandatory time. understand wanting lockdowns value money human life. masks make sense. sounds like anti-drinking-water pro-swallowing-cyanide.  seen looks like China, Italy, NYC, countries around world.

We yet.

Sounds like win me! still accurate website bus system LA extensive, fast Putting mask see people late; already spread respiratory droplets air. assume exaggerated headline, means number deaths last 24 hours twice number previous 24 hours.   record, literal dictionary definition peak “to reach highest point, either specified value specified time“. specified time.

That's 5% population enough overload hospitals least once, twice locations.

This also consistent early estimates IFR 0.8% - 1.2% using repatriation flights China back January/February. probably slightly higher using 20 million number since many cases resolved yet excess death statistics show missed quite least early on.

Air typically floats around occupied space 10-15 minutes, drawn return duct. duct system high-velocity. Air typically duct system less minute, heated cooled, returned occupied space.

First off, important note downvote posts disagree with. also downvote factually incorrect, topically irrelevant, crudely worded. may want reflect suspect I've downvoted post - time due something trivial disagreement. fact, lot posts disagree downvote. Unless meet reason, course. 

Secondly, take pleasure downvoting? answer, hope disappointed, simply ""no"". evaluate posts almost subconsciously read them, downvote reflexively meet criteria listed above. even get time needed find pleasure I'm way.

Thirdly, even hypothetically get time needed potentially feel pleasure it, I'm neither attracted causes downvote, downvoting response criteria.

Due this, thus honestly say no, downvoting give erection. I'm sorry ruins nightly fantasy yours.

I slight, morbid curiosity interested penis stranger, ultimately, want know. you. false come said around 28% daily reminder lock downs prevent cases, delay them. Shutdowns need timed really well. can't done late obvious reasons, also can't done early. Shutdowns obviously massive economic psychological cost them, one shutdown much harder get people board second, cases economically possible. necessarily putting money lives; parts world literally economies completely collapse extended shutdowns. US theory economic power whether shutdowns, say big deal people government shit job providing assistance inaccurate understanding affects people. this, psychological economic costs much greater Americans compared counterparts developed countries provided better assistance.

So, said, top ways administration fucked up, I'd also make argument one size fits approach shutdown really dumb idea. US huge virus contained better beginning, could rolling shutdowns addition better financial assistance. something sane American public health officials talking beginning. paper capability pull off, instead agencies would able running shoe string budget coordination terrible level incompetence appointed officials would responsible giving fuck actually jobs. style shutdown would mirror Europe responded. country, good proxies individual American states scenario due size, shutdown based local situation coordinated eachother reopening. Obviously fuck ups like UK Sweden. also countries like Spain Italy hit beginning lost opportunity contain virus. lot success well.

Now situation US localities hit hard right already used ammunition enforce social distancing. federal government intention helping restock. half people would take help anyways. honestly federal government going do, idea places like Texas going pull without letting fuck ton unnecessary deaths happen. 

This situation basically happened India. shutdown way early forced reopen number case skyrocketing. healthcare system basically collapsed parts country.

Jesus christ whole situation frustrating really, really way US. I'm PITA. place gets core sometimes, hence posts :-)

In previous thread capacity issue, orgy doom. Things like ""it's next Lombardy"", ""Total nightmare"", ""Hurricane season too, fucked"", ""Saharan dust storm too, fucked"". turns story inaccurate, changed ""Hospitalizations lag infections, deaths blah blah"".

Despite claims see leveled (even responses rational comments), lean left, family wears masks, going parties restaurants. take virus seriously simultaneously doom obsessed panicky little girl, lapping MSM headlines DESIGNED stoke fear. people even actually read articles here. people sound like either rooting it, trying validate locking mom's basement hiding away world. ... know, look hospitals call say *How it?* Well 7 day moving average cases going past week two. looks like cases actually increasing. Deaths tend lag weeks good chance deaths likely start rise see till like mid late July probably. Although depending catching virus time round death toll may may severe before. time tell ignorance we're going dealing virus years. 

The takeaway wearing masks outdoors means little risk transmission indoor gatherings without PPE means high risk transmission.

It nothing politics protests. FFS. “You going die.” - Joe Rogan  Lot mixed signals here. Seems like damage control anything else point. Almost “All well, remain calm!” moment. Next week telling NY squeezed lot extra capacity ICU space thin air, I’m sure systems going follow model tricks learned Europe. equivalent point definitely started get really scary NYC however, likely helped drive many folks indoors weeks end. 

Those folks protected job loss eviction point though...Godspeed low income residents South SW South Africa international news all, seeing massive exponential growth cases also opening lockdown. Today ranked 5th overall new cases correct I'm wrong, population 60 million would put us number 1 2 per capita world growth today.


These numbers backlog numbers. Possibly three weeks old. massive backlog testing reporting issue right now, top also test kit shortages again. going government eased lockdown absurd ways could imagine. Schools open two weeks select grades, grades added 6th July. public transport system basically 14-16 people crammed minibus, basically operating fully. Churches restaurants cinemas opened more. Supermarkets stores filled brim people following proper distancing procedure all. many issues give overview.


South Africa road catastrophic consequences. know we've flown radar long look numbers look headlines understand big shit brewing here. Never mind death rate. many survivors going become disabled COPD, cardiac conditions, chronic pain, strokes chronic problems yet discover clusterfuck virus. percent number beds same? probably beefed beds case pandemic preparedness. one raw numbers much better percentages That's great outcome. hope hidden surprises health continues okay. know it? inadvertently infect co-workers taking sick day know time it? followed strict guidelines. got confused whole thing. first ""flatten curve,"" get hospitals overrun. people disregarding everything entirely others staying inside refusing get within 6 feet daylight. actual objective? eradicate covid? flatten curve people slowly get it? I'm legitimately confused see lot different information lot different places. ""[This disaster something predicting future people hating easing restrictions fast enough gonna good physical example reason shut fuck Thats exactly happened NY. midway peak really got testing adequate levels. curve looked linear.  Per http://91-divoc.com/pages/covid-visualization

Not really. government step help shore small business citizens. costly, long term, healthy population understands elected officials work keep alive help build future chances prosperity less costly we're doing. plain dumb.

Watching video fireworks deeply inferior watching fireworks live sounds like waste money bother done. lie say setting fireworks edit together existing footage.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Reading article kind wild. Yes, hospital 100% ICU capacity, yes plans surge. guess what, surge goes far. overwhelmed 3 backups, left low options. TMC alarmist, completely transparent situation. need people take seriously believe not, whole world make COVID make president look bad. much hate say it, Darwinism work. I'm pissed people wearing mask accidentally get close also getting affected. 

&amp;#x200B;

People really irresponsible. Tiny island nations comparable. non-tiny island nations fatter US list Kuwait.

The reasons known phenomenon introduce indigenous population Western diet: balloon enormous size. Millennia genes evolved prevent death starvation suddenly cause death obesity droves. similar impact plagues infectious disease brought outside world. many people die gene pool local population selects remove now-bad genes two three generations.

People like reason knowledge hidden idiots. Years ago visiting Houston pulled side road try panic. trying figure going loops going 10 speed limit people still honking giving finger passing lol actually believe that... oh, ha Intelligence? Right, likewise, people would hard time driving state license plates. 

Sure, 100% effective, would've close enough, especially penalties significant. learn? see dead people. Americans represent humans.

Most planet dismissing hard facts science, even Catholic church. COME DOWN! fair say... ""Houston, problem""?

Also anybody remembers gem? Really needs 2020 remake/sequel.

""This disaster preventable!"" page epidemiology sending infected nursing homes? Asking friend. mean legitimate someone probably offering service, it’s Disney Co related approved. evidence primary spread visiting families friends indoors social gatherings birthday parties, anniversary parties, barbecues lot indoor contact.

Stay fuck home. better nothing put 5 months could never quite got Elon got cult following. SpaceX Tesla bad reputations among engineers years exact kind thing. Lots unpaid overtime, shit management, high turnover rates... would floor playing them. lot people...

I theory people believe things like call ""optimists"" grasp basic science math poor can't imagine anything except best scenario. 

It went like this: there's weird virus going hog wild eastern Asia. Nothing get worried though, never come US. virus here, first confirmed case. disease stopped dozen two people get heal fine. hundred people NY CA, NBA players may it? thousands people dying NYC. virus deadly though, I'm sure we're closing sports venues, movie theaters favorite bar. I'm sure everything fine weeks. 

etc, etc, etc Thats 21% fatality rate hospitalized. Learn read. Yes know, terrible we’re handling this, fear future. seems like we’re prepared plan pandemic all. America :YOLO

Covid: yep trick pay unemployment.  Loldumbpeps 88% ""520 deaths per million"" age sAyInG gRaNdMa dOeSnT mAtTeR ""Dead set.""


I see there. hell lot work lose 150 lbs never booze exercising little day. crazy decade. believe Bill Gates built world's first computer built computer ridiculous like rest statements Loll keep em partying. said Nj/Ny getting pummeled ""they're ready pay consequences."" This. think people realising many deaths avoided thanks ventilators. Specially young people, death rate skyrocket longer available. Fortunately, though, states may able help time. Cool, cool cool cool. Wait they’re saying lockdown crashing economy nothing? even realize many people unemployed right Lab? trying copy Target's forensics lab? like 5.1% mortality rate moves 0.5% Can’t even imagine microscopic &lt;65+ Yeah smells fishy. Someone told stop telling truth.   Guess we'll die 🤷🏽‍♀️. Colorado's lockdown incredibly effective. month built CDC testing/ contact tracing infrastructure scratch. mean, would nice spent February instead April, hardly see that's fault lockdown.

I certainly see poorer states might able build CDC month. 

We'll see states lock down, like Texas Florida, compared us economically. Yeah, enormous aggregation hospital capacity. There's lot obstacles overcome. Internet available everywhere, total remote schooling kids fall cracks. certain age adult supervision required. families unable work home, families parent afford work. personally believe companies get back business, even kid gets sick outbreak happens company essentially say fault kid.
Some willing send kids back, could also stated choice. would heard impossible tested it? one seems understand testing shows whether works (and safe). Currently, know ""it might provide immunity"" ""it probably kill people outright planned dosage"". That's it.

I'll edit add: would expect six months reasonable understanding vaccine available mid 2021. rolling January positive news, need think next 3 5 years (minimum) look like. know Target forensics lab that's good enough law enforcement agencies use it. Maybe Walmart tried emulate that? flU Congrats! finally it! Scandinavian banks done projections predict Norway Denmark better year Sweden.

No last ""Now phase revise GDP forecasts year, poor less bad. looks like GDP fall 4 percent year [In Sweden], rather 7 percent consensus previously look Riksbank National Institute Economic Research. reason domestic economy proved resilient,"" says. point sub talk virus, another anti Trump sub

Alas pretty much politics Makes even frustrated people don’t wear masks don’t take seriously. job life, loved it. Large gatherings hold people think sports teams themselves. People don’t think venue managers, camera operators, trainers, Union groups , ticket sales , partnerships, security , much more. Sports allow jobs even it’s reduced capacity.

I could imagine it’s like education profession. terrible education student. wasn’t teachers taking time tutoring school getting involved wrestling team would different. hope system won’t fail upcoming youth difficult like me. biggest international travel hub always going get hurt fastest biggest. That's epidemeology 101. question react now, NY got shit control. That's whats known ""dick move"". It’s effective way reducing demand ICU beds Bay Area really trajectory Arizona, Texas, Florida? trying quantify fucked everything get here. [De-AMPed Nuke it! Nuke it! Nuke it! Nothing. state shutting again. They'll muddle increasing restrictions, maybe extreme closing businesses. two bites lock apple. really matter bad gets (or say, nowhere close bad needs try lock again). Talking good enough emit droplets.       
*“The big mistake US Europe, opinion, people aren’t wearing masks,” George Gao Fu, director general Chinese Center Disease Control Prevention (CDC), said.*

*“This virus transmitted droplets close contact. Droplets play important role – you’ve got wear mask, speak, always droplets coming mouth.”* I'm sure properly quantify threat commensurate sacrifice, make rough comparisons:

* sacrifice ""liberty"" ""pursuit happiness"" many ways drive.
  * willingly drive red lights, example, would drastically increase threat lives drivers.
  * allow ""liberty"" humans certain age drive certain psychological trends younger humans would increase threat life unreasonable level.
  * also allow ""liberty"" person drive without first testing licensing so.
* sacrifice arguably liberty pursuit happiness pandemic scale, reasons.
  * see driving, license them, generally mitigate threat life overall interest utilizing incredible technology ""driving car,"" cannot said COVID. fact source infection *prior symptoms appearing* huge indication radical sacrifices need make stem spread unusually dangerous disease.
  * I'm sure comparing COVID driving *in general* would best comparison. might better compare driving drunk. Normally constant threat life *both* diseases *and* hurling highway 80mph steel can. But, generally, know mitigate threat acceptable levels. COVID *so* virulent *so* life threatening, would better compare driving drunk: something bad *extremely likely* happen either infected COVID drive intoxicated.

So, tl;dr - give numbers, preventing spread COVID worthy sacrifice liberty pursuit happiness driving. better comparison would be: Illnesses general driving, COVID driving drunk. So.. happens now? Maybe I'm pessimistic partisan everything I'd imagine Pence Trump wore masks we'd even worse higher population areas would decide masks dumb.  long sticking Libs! assume almost production automated. problem factories physically can't produce enough -- US gives around 300M vaccines year want double that. vaccine production, looking highly skilled labor. I'm friends bunch PhD chemists/engineers setup manufacturing plants new products takes good six month year get project starting scale. Elective mean ""optional."" means surgery schedule advance (i.e. result someone appearing ER needing surgery immediately save life.)  increased testing revealing positive cases people without serious symptoms? Methodist TMC yesterday—Nurse told 300 employees Covid. tests administered asymptomatic people young healthy people caught early better job protecting risk category. deaths decreasing. Haha always welcome man, everything calms ;) Looking forward day visit other's countries again, hope sooner rather later. 1% Americans want everybody go back spending money. still going open anyway. came directly petition employees open yet. No, that's case fatality rate. IFR INFECTED fatality rate. Considering mostly likely 10X amount cases currently counted, one knows true amount infected therefore accurate IFR. can't tell IFR tell certainly 5%.

Serological studies seem keep pointing IFR . 5-1%. Needs typo That's seen. time year malls usually empty, past weekend nose bleed parking spaces occupied.  grand scheme things racist all, clear. thought would called super duper vaccine, may something. breaking news, moon made cheese. Yeah, Covid. Real shame. response insightful. Thank sharing! 100k pneumonia deaths half confirmed covid.

Source? Almost certainty. Casinos later open within ""Phase II"", right schedule increase cases. People simply give shit coming here, people coming give shit COVID-19 anyway.

The casinos follow strict best financial interest stay open long possible. already mandate public facing employees needing masks since reopening, think help mitigate further. 

We seen positive trend 4 weeks now, thankfully hospitalizations stayed same. proactive measure like great. Sin City, requiring masks going gamble life. new slogan.  scroll way far find really interesting article that's also quite informative positive wonder anybody actually read whole thing headline.

Sorry point error. still would steal living days auto accidents. 

It already has.  Except actually control part - especially western Canada - idiots likely never see consequences stupidity.

Of course, wouldn’t put past lot people go Florida california vacation next bit. Oh still go see parents. We’ve quarantined respective homes whole time. crash pool hot tub weekly lol. haven’t stopped lockdown either.

/s I'm scientist, mom immune compromised kid looking forward entering freshman year high school attending school like normal kid first time years may continue homeschool. find news FUCKING FANTASTIC! want nothing best fucking high school experience ever everything else ripped starting age 7. Fair. Yes, many people refuse wear masks property management anything it. richer countries providing things like financial aid businesses individuals, food aid, rent mortgage freezes, along regulating business enable work home prevent mass firings. always without issues, large enabled people remain indoors.

It's perfectly doable economic/financial perspective high income countries, likely makes financial sense given costs associated run away pandemic.

I see lower income countries things much difficult achieve, financially terms infrastructure logistics needed implement them. I'd interested measures places could take instead. I'd suspect usual combination social distancing, hand washing, masks. Hey, ""knowing half battle"" *not knowing* must half, right?!? Ask tomorrow, maybe day tomorrow. Gee, thanks. shouldn’t have. time stock basic items. Things available.

But supply chain issues coming nationwide next six months going huge.

Not downplaying cost lives, smart masks etc, might well smart prepared what’s coming. Virtually groups funded people connected Trump hoping 'reopening economy' would undo bad job numbers effort salvage Trump's polling.   life matters
-Coronavirus, 2020 hope you’re right think optimistic. Listen, many people like don’t want look facts. That’s choice. US struggling country it’s pandemic politicized. Look CDC/scientific recommendations. states following science recommends that’s virus contained getting worse. People wearing masks social distancing main problems right now. might get hit car crossing road. personally blame everyone myself. Here's link website tracking R0 values state Newsweek article  never imagined wearing mask stop spread pandemic would crack unified GOP front. things Trump done, things party hurts country, moment actually speak constituents' ignorance Lots testing workers there. Obviously fail containment completely going incredibly hard, since test 0.2% population day. Perhaps ""hope"" accurate ""think"". Yes, yes believe lol. like use word believe. Go look another planet telescope video earth space clearly see eyes. realize look google maps see bad traffic is. get using phones location... country better worse. like putting numbers perspective. want choke guy. still doesn’t understand didn’t catch much spread it. Fuck. This. Guy. hope you’re reading this. FUCK Lol true. rather president Independence Day"" right Supreme Court willed happen first term. second term beat John Kerry. Jeez fucking wine tour pandemic.... jeeez humanity ...... sigh  That's really low! little reason think continue get worse least another 2-3 weeks.

I would argue get better 2-3 weeks new control measures go place, currently really happening. terms daily deaths we're still late March/early April. Funerals literally /r/LastStageCapitalism know?

If fly via direct flight, it'll pretty easy. take connecting flight from, say, Ohio?

Is everyone crosses border going required show ID? might work airport highway, people drive way, take back roads cross NY, NJ CT via regular streets? 

Well, car AZ plates, making easy spot. drive to, say, PA, stay hotel rent car final leg trip?

Even get stopped ""asked"" quarantine, go 14 days? hotel? hotel wants identified, out-of-state potential carrier wandering halls? ""asked"" even mean? politely refuse? ""I'm sorry, Mr/Ms AZ, would mind quarantining next 2 weeks?"" ""No thanks, wanna.""

It seems like could really difficult enforce someone hellbent slipping one states without inconvenience quarantining. feel you...it would nice see right decision made ‘because’ it’s right thing do. 

Their statement whiff passive aggressiveness.

Ummmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm [Is Rubio suddenly going Trump approval rating wonder life Senator much easier, right Governor, Abbott DeSantis would love exchange place Rubio, imagine able act responsibly offending Trump. China lied!!!!! nyc lie too? hear 20 thousand people died month half nyc. Let guess nyc lied filled bunch doomers saying move forward ""Human Centipede: Musical""? One debilitating physical addiction. worse.   strongly dislike Cuomo Wolf state reasons really matter here. still do, fact, general statement. want gone offices ASAP.

I feel same. like Cuomo one bit. actually think great job handling Coronavirus. shutdowns necessary (and still go back forth whether excessive --- currently think appropriate) transparency really good. Whole new meaning Snottsdale Brats.  it’s worth, average person America high risk dying since many us overweight, smoke, etc. 

So even deaths likely unhealthy group, America belongs unhealthy group. doesn’t bode well. 

People japan much healthier risks smaller. 

Sorry hear mom. lost mom pancreatic cancer decade ago. Life’s tough let’s get we’re here. know going back lockdown right thing do. wife Nurses life family life same. hell us. :( joke. .he making fun people call ANYTHING covid 19 add list reason went everyones head  5 months seems firmly established 2 groups people beliefs regards address virus/lockdown. 

Try friends refer document group section number see fall spectrum.

Group A: 

1.) modified TEMPORARY lockdown (I.e ability lockdown rapidly event hospitalization rates reach critical levels)

2.) essential businesses remain open

3.) gradual reopening non-essential businesses based regional cases/variables. 

4.) federal state level financial support affected businesses populations. (Divert spending defense et. al. crisis pretend maybe virus like global terrorist

a.) yes means pay long run,

b.)yes nation done before

c.) it’s end world take loan ourselves.

5.) use masks distancing places business standard practice. it’s:

a.) widely evident effective virus.

b.) Based peer reviewed data (scientists proof checking scientists google searches).

c.) based concepts PPE, BSI healthcare providers effectively relied since modern medicine.

6.) science based

7.) similar approaches shown work used world.

8.) repeating steps effective treatment (plasma therapy, antiviral etc.) vaccine widely available.

9.) science based

10.) based preserving much human life reasonably possible. means:

a.) accepting everyone saved.

b.) accepting put measures mitigate loss life money.

c.) accepting life important money.


Group B:


1.) wants keep nearly businesses open sake economy. 

a.) fails realize war attrition economy loses people hospitalized die I.e can’t show work.

b.) considered sound strategy actual economists long run.

2.) argues government assistance long term plan, sake economy because:

a.) wanting “debt” even though accumulate nearly every war defense project necessary unnecessary. 

b.) fails realize defense spending cited makes half entire US federal discretionary spending every year.

3.) wants things also want wear mask social distance either because:

a.)doesn’t believe works (not scientifically supported).

b.)doesn’t want “forced” to.

c.) doesn’t want inconvenienced to.

d.) led others believe one above.

4.) downplays ignores/refutes science without providing alternative peer reviewed data. may see examples as.

a.) “I don’t know anyone virus.

b.) “it’s practically thing flu”

c.) “the death rate 0.5% I’ll take chances behalf everyone else”.

d.) “what one time when.....”

e.) “do sources?”

f.) “I don’t believe sources...what about...”

5.) fine accepting however many deaths unnecessarily occur long it’s economy ok. *see Group B: 1-A, 1-B

6.) again, based science. Faith humanity took hit watching that. Clearly referring IFR McConnell: ""Please wear mask"" Surprised low state (virginia) others. lifting lot restrictions next week, interesting turns out...  We've done it, we've lost Halloween. one weekend. I’m either. best case people panic cause shortages don’t run crowd.

And buying bit extra every time doesn’t mean “hoarding” me. 

Hoarding connected panic buying trying profiteer.

Supply chains disrupted. can’t go two months without coffee. :) smart thinking. July 4th holiday. Also, it'll 2 weeks since Tulsa happened.

I think pretend everything fine july 4th want people celebrating spending money. guess shit hits fan sometime july 15 July 22. 2 weeks 4th everyone parties. 

Also, tax's officially due 15th Congress gets back recesss 17th. people dying? Thats thing matters. every single person infected, 0.26% would die. fewer infected, fewer would die. Ya mask would smudge makeup Realistically, today already pretty close 150,000? (Assuming states undercounting, obfuscating, straight lying) Creating fake card get permission infect people really something else. That's get education pathetic business Florida. bunch insane witches believing right Also, working heavy duty PPE (ideally) strict decontamination protocols (again ideally) makes job harder difficult. idk paradise turnip supporters certain ""news"" completely banned crimes humanity (propaganda brainwashing) would amazing. People would stop fucking stupid believing PizzaGate George Soros running everything behind scenes. )

You dropped this. Sometimes can't save people themselves. Trying get people wear masks harder getting heroine addicts stop. confirm, driving hour loop interstate decompress listen podcasts, bunch awful drivers full force last Sunday. Protesters holding signs say ""Free All"". Yeah, let move next door you? Awful comparison smfh Imagine people without masks throwing fit allowed in. going many viral videos Disney opens modifications. trust data hospital occupancy nah?  Ya employees petition knew wasn’t safe it’s hotspot... know right, even like one month think would've okay...mind blowing real epidemic many stupid selfish assholes country. kind crazy badly Trump handled election year. Literally handed second term silver platter listen experts CDC shut up. 

I still voted guy principal, know mom likely would without second thought. really driven home every ""moderate"" idiot is. symptoms go? Everyone ok? Good. Apparently U.S. work drop. Dead. worth, Titanic sank tried turn. iceberg ripped hull prevented ships design actually working intended; could stayed afloat 4 5 forward compartments full water gash let water many more.

But yes, Texas dumb fuck.  country

Part country. specific party drag us refuse act like grown ups. Shit! resisting peer pressure. McGowan too, much respect.   It’s MO - pop pathetic head every months score brownie points look like he’s growing spine, he’ll back old gutless self. Fuck Marco Rubio. Tbh thought going picture Trump Sorry hear that. Rubio re-election? thought 2022? Didn’t win 2016? see, makes sense. ICU drive thru, covid using dine in. sums perfectly think keep nursing homes US profit low paid staff models? ""globe-denier""

What sound like might be? It’s pretty self-explanatory. True.  supporter protests, saw dangerous could be, regards COVID 19. Last option? options think left? weeks 10k infections daily plus knows many deaths hospital system crashes. “Defund police... increase funding better training, bestow necessary financial resources address quality issues personnel shortages” counterintuitive gets, get point. least social distancing follow signs person gets sick, rescheduling could option. July 6 late. Newsom needs start locking things starting today/tomorrow. deaths? stats see still show number deaths falling.

If people getting deaths increase within week two? happening?

Maybe virus spreading faster less lethal. maybe testing before. younger people getting dying.

All things seem positive. mean 7 day average deaths 2000s, compared 600-700 we’re seeing now? test percent positive 15-20%, compared 5.6% today? 

Many areas doubt much worse, countries numbers whole trending bad way, we’re still ways bad April hopefully people adjust behavior prevent really ugly numbers happening again. Old middle-class white people lose minds another lockdown gets placed US  guys even know strains ur state? recently found Vancouver area Washington/California strain Quebec Toronto NY/European strain. mouse starved cheese long time hungry...but I’m 100% agreement Newsom Disney’s park employees (whose union’s wrote letters Newsom asking wait).

The mouse needs come rungs. Offices shouldn’t crowded masks worn. Try open states early corporations could gain money ""bring back economy"" cases spike again.

who would've would happen except sane person.

I surprised planned way bleed americans poverty.  clue: “Wearing face mask *posses*” all, wants know graduated High School last menstruation was. get know first, see. cannot ask questions right away!

[reading article rich people are. That's stay rich. reddit phds told young people mild symptoms!! lies reason to. fucking bizarre. Y'all remember Blue Angels flew beat COVID?

Well COVID's back pissed. Lol ""Suggests""

Such headline Perhaps lower risk people tested higher risk people careful.

Also, morbid thought, risk first die Yup want economy get back running realize need get virus control actually get economy back. “Written iPhone made Chinese forced labor factory” 

Meanwhile Tesla employs thousands Americans, follows labor laws, done almost anyone fight climate change us stayed outraged throughout...

I like fact I'll spend 2020 self-imposed isolation, I'll needs done. continue heckle idiots throughout. poorest hit hardest lockdown social
distancing measures there’s that. Lol,
Not surprising.

Here's thing, there's way much misinformation going around be. care opinion, 
I mean, you. 

But confuse facts w opinion. rich already bunkers built everywhere. decently good business too. Covid-19 hit, many simply retreat hiding villas watch world unfolded. Many tickets reserved space travel such. sounds like ridiculous conspiracy true. SoCal Central Valley definitely need time out. However, still 17 counties hospitalizations several others few. might productive (and instructive) order regional shutdowns. 

Counties transmission low need wear masks test like there's tomorrow. might actually comply see counties shut knowing could next.

In general, Newsom needs take page Angela Merkel's playbook explain importance keeping transmission rates one. reopening, transmission rates need well one wiggle room allow transmission go bit reopening. 

So far impression even understands important is. probably does, give impression. Really important statistic talk really want beat back virus. Otherwise de facto herd immunity strategy. 

Now we're finally testing people, might possible calculate transmission rates positive cases specifically positive rates. depends many still missing. However, hospitalizations may still best proxy. suppose calculate ways, positive rates hospitalizations, go there. 

Regardless, talk anything transmission rates drummed people's heads. What's unusual quote marks?

Let's honest - one's gonna speak protests given current social climate. articles like automatically suspect basis alone. NYC: hospitals SLAMMED Covid patients.

Houston: Hold beer. 500 cases death early estimate. so,  125,000 x 500=62,000,000+ cases. larger serology studies came roughly 10x estimate month back. Again, 40% Covid deaths NY listed nursing homes (I don’t trust figure refused release stat right away prompted made sure get ducks row reporting, think reporting). NY 3 straight months lockdown, delaying cases, deliberately say delaying can’t truly prevent people getting forever, lockdowns flatten curve (a lot people forget original premise). Florida open long now? knew cases would go up, fact aren’t experiencing run hospitals massive spikes deaths. People saying wait two weeks almost 2 months now. Yikes.

Or abandon stores shop outside? Left right, trust them. could good news would greatly lower mortality rate overall. ten times number people contracted COVID without need hospitalize without fatality see good news. 

On hand means virus spread even precautions taken implies ineffective stopping spread. would bad news.

So recently started birth control seasonal allergies bad rn lately pretty much always headache runny nose sore throat. feeling super great general

But point get corona test? Like general, I’m 99% aren’t covid symptoms rn I’ve month real progression worsening. know ideally would stay house go work symptoms way rn would mean never leave house. 

I’ve told feel significantly worse fever cough I’ll get tested know I’ll feel guilty shrug symptoms allergies end infecting others ""Breathing vital biological activity physical emotional well being. Oxygen No.1 nutrient every living organism including humans.

Why must dispelled over? sick virus symptoms, spread even asymptomatic. words, many people contract virus idea happened. everyone needs wearing masks. Get it. talking about? hoax right? right? /s Possibly also expensive, know. Everything bigger Texas ? wonder many people Houston ICU beds come outside Houston. Rural hospitals might ICU bed used get person stable enough transfer major hospital appropriate expertise. Yeah way he's acted coronavirus really made disillusioned him. looked bit deeper companies, I'm convinced he's actually evil. Australia -we pretty well Sorry, misunderstood fudging. many links would assume that's reason happened case I'm referring well.

Dude, what's wrong people?? Interestingly, even Colorado, *fittest* state US, obesity rate \~20%. states' obesity rates rise last scary fuck. like horror movie stuck house killer loose front door locked bars windows. go upstairs outcome sketchy even worse basement. Surviving supremely tactical.
 
That America time. 

Might horrible analogy - I'm stickin it. Yeah pretty laughable Europeans feel European exceptionalism comes Corona. US states hit hard right open longer, EU everyone's also running around like nothing concerned anymore yeah think they're gonna see huge flare ups August / September. Ok D00mer, even idiots get lucky sometimes. Keep moving goal posts around! Lower infection rate begin with. Ez. 

Let ask this; protests LA, densely populated, even warrant quarantine, would say lockdown anywhere long people wore masks? 

I mean gathering large groups close proximity safe long masks worn, gathering regular proximity (normal day-to-day life, including workplace) masks safe. 

I doubt would argue lockdown quarantine long masks worn. Yet, instance simply wearing masks makes situation safe.. can’t help see double standard. 

The protest safe exercise quarantine imposed protesters much imposed rally goers. two situations less safe going work. irony posting story **this** sub *\*chef kissing fingers\** can't put ventilator room. needs connected main oxygen supply hospital. ICU rooms set ventilator support. may bought, borrowed stolen many ventilators got enough viable rooms plug into. would wonderful could somehow make purely objective exam issues filter morons. Ugh... two roommates persistent coughs within past couple months. 

One damn cough since February/March still although it’s bad was. 

We live relatively small apartment too, thank god leaving within next month.

And one nerve bring one friends back small apartment national lockdown place; pissed off.

WTF wrong people little empathy common sense would take chance infecting anyone let alone family member. many people refusing listen doctors scientists topic. baffles don’t think I’ll ever understand someone behaves manner I'm pretty sure military did. need come together country make masks social distancing mandatory.

Probably bought engagement ring bet, lol. happened Wal-Mart Quebec well. Wal-Mart close unionize Quebec's Labour laws. reading article. says concerns unsafe work conditions. pandemic. Not, “i want stay home sit ass get paid”. It’s part article didn’t exist. Dead.

""No one could predicted this."" they're florida - preventative measures temperature check I'm starting think it'll happen regardless wins.

If Trump gets re-elected (not likely, remember fraud thing narcissists known accuse victims things themselves), opposition going react very, negatively.

If Biden wins, slower boil. Reps going blame Dems/BLM double notion Marxists (whether ultimately matter them). event start restricting rights people (and I'm saying Dems that...because parties complicit point), going angry Rep base wants fight.

&amp;#x200B;

I really see ending well people allow continue trajectory. :(

&amp;#x200B;

I hope I'm wrong. voting done quickly, 3 month delay results new government taking office. know put /s, that's literally position rich donors politicians. 30% shouldn’t even allowed vote wouldn’t pass stupidity test. knew there. Think bit. lol higher threats warrant less liberty pursuit happiness? &lt;&lt;White House Official: Americans “Just Live With” Massive Coronavirus likely die it. widely reported time, let's forget astroturfed fuck. better love too, remotely indispensable yet. Fair point. Texas still arguing governors order banning requiring masks means. problem is, 30% vote consistently absolutely matter swing states. rest us average vote much consistent basis.

There's also amazingly still lot people care. one friend always adamant voting matter (even though we're Florida absolutely does). first time voting, specifically vote Trump kid's future. that. Hey dingleberry, supposed suppress expelling droplets sick prevent spreading others. Nice show person care though. Exactly. always need hear sides story. Adding that, try maintain social distancing shaking hands / hugging also claim counting people entering leaving

The store I've seen counting people coming going best buy near me. Like full tent set outside entrance, 2 workers gadgets waited line (just me) someone walked Yes, it’s insanely stupid. Along fact voting always Tuesday workplaces give day go vote trained staff PPE this? Bezos play role shitty Amazon is? Real question. Like direct role vilified ignoring could change it?

Or underling like VP SVP, etc Bezos gets blame face / leader Amazon? waves. one big river.  envy find conversation unrealistic. Doesn’t Joe Rogan live LA County? They're telling people get surfboards. 

Morons. Italy locked hard ditto domestic terrorism

They're ones burning cities, declaring autonomy, pulling statues, attacking cops. Exactly! Remember weeks ago said cases would spike due reopening? look silly now, dont they? That’s 3 days ago. yesterday’s seeing human beings, outdoors distanced? Prepare imminent death!! kidding prepare actual comments.

I would go prepacked. Buffet seems leave room sharing germs. fake orange skin. guess better real orange skin. it’s even July. It’s going long terrible summer... broadcast safety homes probably access many tests need.   Im Lakewood. Every place walk too, employees wearing masks 70-80% customers wearing too. pro-science, anti-death party. Fuck Elon Musk. Florida next. Herd immunity?
Nope, like culling herd. Karens huh? Sounds racist me. know blacks play literally HUGE role Americas insanely high obesity/diabetes %s right?  January 20 Inauguration Day live Texas nobody taking serious. masks, social distancing, asshole Trump worshipping family STILL thinks democratic hoax. can’t believe ignorant are. Hear hear I’m turning 40 met partner last year. People like it’s never. probably regional shutdown. live Illinois divided us 4 sections areas shut case one outbreak.

Shutdowns like really expensive weapon, use painful, regional shutdowns make sense. work therapy clinic well. Get sneezed kids can’t wear masks mouth toys every single day. best clean much possible, anxiety every single day. Hey, I'm trying pull sources, seem dead end? Pay bills provide supplies food need I'd glad stay home. Proportional Florida worse right now? that's exactly point. one thing, likely current spike due mass protests subsided now. another thing, cases rise, people's behavior changes. weeks, like mid april, probably see cases taper hospital workers furloughed. Well said. telling husband people New England go vacation New England many people state come hang week unless they've got lots money. national plan. business told virus still long April, could taken steps necessary re-open way limits spread. They’ve consistently wrong overly optimistic months now. Yikes - don’t think it’s good idea see mother...  feel frustration!! It’s mind boggling human life isn’t worth preserving financial interests. type stupidity I'm referring to. Interesting see studies linked diatribe. Seriously stick conservative subreddits going convince engineer ignore science. argument masks negative effect children's psyche (fucking lol serious?)

The CDC botched development &amp; rollout pretty simple PCR assay. CDC happily participated 'don't test, tell' cover-up real # stateside cases. CDC FDA territorial pissing matches one another around test regulation. FDA hindered effective deployment tests therapies every turn. entire journalistic chattering class lecturing American public 2 weeks ago over-reacting virus calling wrong name dangerous virus itself. American economy spent last 3 decades moving every single manufacturing facility shred know-how could make PPE, ventilators, pharmaceutical precursors overseas save pennies, stopped government. we've learned Congress given accurate assessment pandemic threat months ago chose to... sell private stocks.

Instead acting hysterical, people strong together? people like here? Acting like isnt helping others. Fear contagious. feel bad cant handle stuff.  selfishness dishonesty American young population brought nation knees. soon young people knew people died covid-19 old, went party, ignore social distancing, exercise freedom, argue wearing face masks, protest BLM, reopen business, name it. social responsibility. Hack, that, openly shamelessly promote actions endanger others. America decay. I'd watch back American youth around me. missteps administration go one greatest fuck ups history, we’re still writing over. Yeah, I'm business praising people job.

You're supposed job. brainwashed puppets Thank you! would completely gone knew extremely upset friend didn’t tell beforehand... know careful though worked lockdown. sit traffic 3 months. beautiful. Kushner raided shipments paid states seized give cronies resell markup without justification. That’s __something__ Maybe wait two weeks two months CA fucking hotspot. 40% increase single day. Interesting, still poll via “random” phone nimbers supposed influenced articles follow. Right. see poll article, think, someone wanted write article called people. even call phone numbers random anymore? There's way numbers correct. Northwell health (new york state's largest hospital network) reports CFR 0.7%. getting 2.8% number? If? think misunderstand mean. see 1 person wearing mask correctly, business whole correctly. Like couple people it, consider still dangerous. Even people going beyond bare minimum 

I mean everybody following rules. easy see least people matter business Keep Arizonans travelling states leave virus Mexico. vaccine they're talking inactivated virus one. mature technology unlikely side effects, might give limited resistance require booster shots. believe also hard make bulk culture lot virus, might make spending lot.  tell needed wear time, lol guys also air condition hell everything gives pretty ideal place spread inside.

I'm definitely trying say good response, remember early models (maybe March-ish) showed 2 million dead US UK. find going back time, I'll link them. 

Definitely response awful, we've learned quite lot spread virus made us lower suspected IFR quite bit. important measure statistically consider well countries relation other, relation early projections much info Getting nostalgic April... say protests. official word yet. Unfortunately laying smackdown candy asses. This. lockdown job officially 2 months I've received nothing. Even consider lucky, friends who've receiving funds suddenly stopped well benefit ending dates. According VEC states outstanding claim need speak deputy. Others even received PUA. 

Its common issue. feel may pay funds back. 
 Partially understanding. Allow like outdoor classes indoor. could wrong tho heard passing Americans stupid, listen them. primary cause spread people indoors without PPE. Outside ppe lowest risk.

Listen scientists, average Americans. Americans think Flintstones documentary wearing mask tyranny. Yes largest developed country. scaled population tested plenty countries. Everything's bigger there, hear.  Work change, absolutely, don’t discount Bill Rights. make comment untrue stopped testing werewolves went away? states (i.e. Florida, Texas, etc) suspending alcohol licences types violations. think 60 day suspension sends right message. provides strong deterrent similar business, increasing compliance public safety. recounting battle lasted month 2000 one state. Gore conceded election december 13th Florida house legislature awarded electoral votes Bush. *still* people comments site saying coronavirus fear overblown warned hospitals would overcapacity never happened. miracle! realize prevented outcome many places taking action. like saying die infection due antibiotics- therefore infection bad. don’t even know would call willfully ignorant. It’s evil.

**February 1st** supplied [isolated Tesla Shanghai employees couldn’t get infected coworkers family clock. video tweet specifically says, “Apartments”.

**March 17th** told employees: best guess, worth, based latest Center Disease Control data, confirmed COVID-19 (**this specific form common cold**) cases exceed 0.1% US population. Moreover, think, look back 2020, causes death serious injury changed much 2017

Now correct I’m wrong Tesla normally enforce social distancing, supply isolated apartments, PPE, common cold outbreaks? so, didn’t Fremont back March? May? now?  still local enconony restaurants, bars on.Those suffer far countries... People poor, developing countries appear older difficult lives. Nothing race ethnicity. Life tough places. mention police pretty much blown whatever credibility authority have. pretty sure LAPD officer tried write mask ticket would get spat face think bad culture goes hand hand bad bosses work environments. exist companies size. important interview would working interview see good fit. people work make break deal. majority people breaking bodies living barely get minimum wage.

The one negotiated agreement pass ""better overall test"" - ie negotiated pay rates nationally legislated minimum wage...


The one used members contributions push stance abortion sex marriage without consulting members views were... (and change stance ""neutral"" received overwhelming evidence step majority members - may lost hold them)

Yes, please ""What sweden"" standing hole full shit level underlip. anti-tesla propaganda probably thinks great job today stopping elective surgeries. Sigh. problem bro. Example: government told us buy masks, masks work, knew saying something untrue. shape behavior (discourage hoarding panic buying masks short supply HC workers) shape perceptions (prevent immediate fury panic criminally unprepared America every level government). 

A huge portion ""it's fine"" messaging lying purpose prevent panic. remember Family reunions surprise B Day parties guidelines. saying leadership carry blame, think plenty go around. Brando Sando house could mask, that's apparently political. Hmm, know bunch like, though.

It's mere weeks since people NYC saying 'ohh no-one's saying wear outside - indoors, least do'.

Now daily shaming people outside without one.

You'll asking visors next. Get fucked. Hide want catch it. Masks. Hand washing/sanitizing. Social distancing. 

Some reopening could worked safely wasn’t done virus gone clear! symptoms Covid-19 something else. early signs get tested. absolutely way anyone sub tell whether sure without looking test results.

I aware contact tracing turning large numbers contact protests.

High prevalence masks and.being outside helped lower transmission factor seems Pretending like Tesla unethical company around retarded take hope... work Texas Medical Center. came home actually. fucking nightmare here. mayor doesn’t give two shits.  Nah. Luckily lot local jurisdictions started mandatory mask ordinances major cities since governor care. data contact tracers... transmissions linked protests outdoors mask extremely low risk. plenty people speak protests second trace outbreak back one... see mentioned every damn thread there's plenty governors mayors would love take heat police departments. data showing much risk protesting conditions. Yea reading article might counter-intuitive activate HSP...same blocking ACE II receptors covid attaches too... 


There earlier studies conflicting results blood pressure meds blocked ACE 2 receptors...it seems body kind over-compensates cases...try remember even unhealthy human body HIGHLY TUNED biological machine...when one part goes another part goes DOWN...

""TMC leaders"" stands ""Texas Medical Center leaders"". hospital system capacity become overwhelmed,"" TMC leaders **warned Houstonians *letter* Thursday, **four CEOs *signed letter* backed off**, saying level alarm ""unwarranted.""

How would describe CEOs TMC, ""leaders""? quote basically said ""4 guys signed letter warning us posturing like warning fear mongering.""

What fuck TMC leadership send kind contradictory messaging? ones issued warning, what? Fortunately Disneyland California seems delaying least. going put severe damper eager people get back shop

Yeah, you’re attend football games. 

Let stop  Nah sub liberal bias like Reddit (and developed world, matter), big difference sub blocks pro- anti-Trump content equally. Lock down. Yes that's one way could go. to.

From downtown would long way. Maybe finally teach us quit electing absolute dipshits positions power. Germany, established slowdowns (not actually lockdowns bc people restricted homes) equivalent county level. County 50 new cases per 100000 people within week? Close everything apart supermarkets, pharmacies doctors, pretty much.

Companies proactively send employees home. I'm actually banned desk (to keep minimal distance office) wfh since... Uh.. March? Disneyland CA has, Disney World FL.  yet medical professional works ICU ER, one impacted states, never devolved shit show levels like Italy China. Never surpassed max ICU capacity. handling far better Europe! Without testing fudging numbers!

But keep reading anti-American propaganda, I'll keep actually risking life intubating treating patients froth mouth situation actually understand first hand experience in.  cling myth self-made billionaires desperately? gathering thousands people vs normal everyday interactions.

demanding justice vs striving avoid poverty.

Your insistence painting side ignorant side flawless 'political' posts nothing irritating. Wish did. live county opened early require masks. top county state! 
To top off, people Quarantined states came county get “Out House” Um, Thanks sharing?!?! wearing mask here. Yeah. Get back us death toll. vote want. know several people it. One actually sat next infectious. Don’t know deaths. Fine excessive grossly disproportionate gravity offense designed punish. might think $5000 excessive example, many judges probably disagree. Also politically would look bad cops started hanging tickets seems take 2-3 weeks showing symptoms death, really make sense compare two daily numbers. Early probably lot missed cases tests harder get, Prove wrong. Bill Gates self-made billionaire like Jeff Bezos, Donald Trump, Kendall Jenner. Unfortunately topic quite bore JFC they're citing actual contact tracing data washington outside wearing mask leads extremely low chance transmission inside without one leads transmission. reinforcing already know. protest regardless political beliefs fine outside mask. often someone else comments literally exact characters wanted contribute, are!

Ive done minimal baby prep since can’t go shopping anywhere. would 100% chosen get pregnant knew coming. Yet know friends due early next year - CRAZY? expect go baby showers not. Hell no. I’m real hard time feeling bad people sitting home last months. working **making less people unemployment**, exposing virus wife cancer home.

Edit: wife cancer also work throughout this, also less people unemployment people still vote asshole. Like anesthesiologist aunt uncle. can't fix stupid.

Alberta I'm required go back work offer position back following covid-19 regulations..

 Yet customers grouping up, getting close you,pretending oblivious rules generally reckless. time back, havent seen 1 person wear/handle mask properly.

You replying comment southern US comment Massachusetts; topic. That's downvoted. 3 populous states CA, TX, NY reporting record numbers. rural go. people taking seriously.

Fewer patients ""needing"" ventilators, surviving. Coincidence? lot people also care affect them. virus killing white people much higher rates black people, think would handled differently. That's majority people risk beyond standard symptoms. went wrong; isolated healthy individuals, isolated at-risk ones. know increase death rate usually happens 2 3 weeks infection rate starts skyrocket. would say increase deaths say 2 3 weeks... maybe 1 month now... I'm South African I'm saying trying inject politics in. passing info money coming. didn’t give 1200 again.
Just it’s taking awhile process people doesn’t mean aren’t giving still receive money because, they're working essential job like grocery store worker medical staff, they're putting others risk there. 

No shouldn’t. government shouldn’t hand money people extremely low chance Covid affect Even they're working home, still get put money hands people use put money back whatever businesses still open?

They are. sad still headlines. depressing enough seeing FEBRUARY. Nice see results time. 
Viral Tidal wave!! thought reason get mad headlights face mirrors getting hangry. Rogan say him?  No, money needs come somewhere. Right interest payments national debt surpass entire defense budget. tens trillions future obligations funded. trillions added due COVID.

Taxes need significantly raised near term future pay current debts obligations. US flat broke massive debt right now; essentially chasing exponential inflation keep party alive. also seem interested pumping stock market actually future.

What's handed right directly taken future future generations. I’m grateful governor. need enough voters survive vote back office. Total bullshit. 3.9% Americans feel way. took data turned fallacy. Nah. US pretty steady ~5% tests positive last couple weeks (even trending downward slightly). 3 days ago 5.9% tests positive, yesterday 6.4% today 7.7%. spikin'. spikin' hard. many infected?

Is data comes close suggesting haven’t experienced kind spike despite mass protests, lockdown restrictions lifted, etc.

Don't social distancing measures established? face masks mandatory NYC? two factors shown help prevent transmission, surprising big know trust research regarding IFR estimations

Sure, I'm sold lowest end estimation, especially seems case countries vast majority cases (i.e. Singapore) among young healthy. true. Back March one grocery store overheard stock clerks laughing one saying ""masks anything"". rolled eyes ignored them, parroting hearing news. Two weeks later masks required public places state. Let's hope go r/Masks4All ! hope well. It’s change this, New Yorkers taking thing serious shit right utilizing masks well respecting distancing public part yes? ingredients success, people Texas please take control even leaders sending mixed signals so. 

Y’all pivotal moment right now. handle next week two huge, huge impact summer. believe well wish nothing best stay safe possible thing...it’s ugly hell gets control. 

Sincerely,

A Northeast States Citizen Take easy buddy...just take easy. We're crush lives. need dose reality exponential growth works. early March killing single double digit numbers nationally. logic 100k dead June would’ve farcical multiply 1000 deaths/day (way larger US experienced point) wouldn’t get 100k... yet (and real number likely much higher thousands states reporting massive spikes pneumonia deaths typical case numbers. weeks ago Indiana 2.5k covid deaths 2k pneumonia. previous 5 years they’d averaged 500 pneumonia period).

Now I’m saying necessarily grow fast appears things like mask wearing help lot. But, 1 mil dead Americans time next year absolutely possibility reasonable circumstances (as probably ~300k dead Oct another peak like April). Hell 1 mil year’s end possible states refuse lockdown again.

The fatality rate virus estimated 0.5-1%, multiplied US’s pop (only ~60-70%’s needed herd immunity), get million dead. Unless prevent disease spreading scenario highly likely. And, point disease widely dispersed it’ll take severe measures bring control. makes hopeful much hostility. mean, mad, look us Yanks see bad things could be. serious locking care life build temp hospitals. bring fourth year med students run them. Fox News anchors wipe, tell audience to. US plague zone two thirds deadly even horrifying EU plague zone. Deaths per million tells clearly. UK, Italy, France, Spain, Belgium, Sweden utterly failed. exceptions (Greece major outlier), EU criminally negligent response multitudes died it. said, US going give run money long game, that’s sure.

*edit* props must however given Germany well, may utterly failed first recovered prevent total disaster. It’s irritating. TX, FL, AZ, AL, TN, GA, OK, NC, SC, etc waited Memorial Day even week rushed Phase 2 2 weeks starting Phase 1, would fine. knew May 1 early nearly everyone Southeast open then. Go r/Masks4All ! lil rubes coming common sense. We’re living world smartest aged 18 24. God help us world good hands? anyone remember March Early April Texas Florida basically gloating NY northeast cities? actually thought somehow immune due population density heat/humidity. virus churning country. Unless going China style lockdown, make way through. slow methodical burn though people seem care. Could imagine animal biting 30k people day killing 500-1000? unseen virus, people care though. strange.  Quarantines enough. Close fucking borders. Everyone stupid.  three weeks ago literally posted article Michigan's decisions postpone cancer treatments safety patients explaining delayed safety daughter. unrelated?

And yes, elective means wait, literally elective surgery is. wait... life threatening. dangerous wait, semi elective part ban. 

But sure, go lack reading comprehension... Dumbass. Sounds like bullshit me. Good.  logic everyone flyover states move get paid better need extra money.

No, ""by logic"" money would mostly go luxury. Statistics show, 18 days average death.

4.5 days till symptoms.. 11 days till hospitalization. missed back forcibly separated children parents border locked conditions probably get fined subjecting animal to, let alone human child. 

I mean fuckups probably beyond scope single reddit post particular one never forgotten. Yes, did. cases it’s true... worries. It’s definitely topic us TTC community. hate this. disability. like make identity, claim it, tell people consider disability outside work accomodations feel ADA mostly created people struggle far need assistance many things. 

But frankly mind making point comes disability neurological, acquired autoimmune response illness, would sure hell like get Covid symptoms progress livable totally debilitating. I'm sure many people disability vote. 

The people using cards ones sucking wearing mask ultimately protect people really can't wear mask real disabilities. 

Imagine healthy person wheeling wheel chair employee would shopping know employee can't ask proof justification. Absolutely nobody would stand that. proud this? grades? glad know now. already hate going dentist, need added sense failure. number reflect newly reported active cases newly reported active antibody cases? anywhere reports active antibody cases separately? know might negligible would still like see numbers look like separated. course can’t stop someone hellbent way heard explained is: ‘hey discourages 50% people would travelled so, that’s improvement every little improvement helps’ mean, *yet* considered disability? Saying worth political view. mixing politics profession never right regardless side on.

And want talk black people dying sides situation. little 200 black people killed every YEAR US cops includes justified kills self defense, unjustified ones. estimates posted quoted virus expert earlier showed 200-1100 deaths per DAY protests US. There's already like 29 days protests seems continuing nonstop. 

The protests going kill way people possibly saved protests. way I'm talking magnitudes more, little more. hate it, too, *not* want get thing.

That said, maybe thoughts non-expert help. would sit watch barber put fresh pair gloves touches you. Make sure you’re wearing N95 mask (or even better, P100 respirator, specialty items probably hard get now). wouldn’t crazy keep eyes closed much possible you’re sitting (I normally getting haircut).

When get home, I’d jump right shower.

If first appointment day, almost certainly fine. course, it’s *almost* you’ll worrying there’s way eliminate it. word. 

But knew know...even distancing bit comical end...emphasize...in end.

But since usually attend big gatherings...or medium...or even small much...easy distance. surprising Texas' IFR? add 99 100, probably due rounding occurred make percentages whole numbers Theyre ""so bad"". use RECORDED DATA. taking account many deaths counted. Yeah maybe go vacation middle pandemic...just thought  People need afraid thing likely kill them- COVID-19.

Also, kill someone giving COVID-19 refuse wear mask, responsible outcome (yes saying face legal consequences that). slight story downside flexible testing mechanism make contact tracing stuff difficult since decentralized bit part yea- headline waaayyyy overblown - honestly annoying, cousins support trump point stories like say fake news (except fox still really bad reek bias editorialization like CNN articles- I'm still working showing wrong getting there) bring articles failures shortcomings point Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  im hopeing another lockdown buy dip  stop there!? Make 300k! Yikes.

Edited add: really think ‘debate’ internet change someone’s mind thinks way?  close! Yeah, wearing mask like wearing giant target. It’s frustrating! anti-vaxer, getting one Trump promoting campaign trail... Fuck that. US fucking joke. Fuck country Canada, anyone lost income eligible $2k/month ongoing. inside replacement people, enough keep wolves away. Ontario, Canada, provincial premier, Doug Ford, trying style populist like Trump. Coronavirus came, Ford let experts take lead, part let science lead.

He's tons political points folks loathed him. we're close, close, opening again. Facebook flooded q conspiracy shite can't believe level wacko people spew. Sorry dads wagon gotta tuff. it’s hot fuck here. 😂 fly north summer. best everything! fabulous? two waves one AMAZING one? imported cases people returning countries. Local cases people get Taiwan. 73 days since local transmission. Masks stop gap. Avoiding crowds people, basic human hygene (Shower wash clothes soon get home) literally staying home probably closest thing safe probably be.

Edit: okay I'll make GUESS. 77243 tested infections 16 days ago 2,293 tested deaths today. I've guessed 16 day delay testing death. I'll guess undercounting infections 75% deaths 55%. gives 308972 nfections 5095 deaths. 1.65% IFR.

What hell even talk Event 201? months back simple napkin math: 330M Americans, 75% infection herd immunity, 0.5%-2% death rate = 1 5 million dead Americans time runs course.

Black people country often treated like criminals cops vicious things innocuous actions (see OK kids slammed ground arrested “jaywalking” street sidewalk -by definition jaywalking, dude gunned GA jogging). Putting face mask makes people look like criminal (I know felt weird first time went store mask on), understand many black Americans would rightfully fear might get cops called wearing mask.

My job requires 900 sqft room ~18 people nearly 10hrs day, several times within 4 feet one speaking one another. required wear mask cannot maintain 6 feet apart(no one wears mask). 

My question even able maintain 6 feet apart wear mask confined room together day, would particulates air us talking day circulated throughout room completely expose everyone daily basis? That's bit gray area. federally run sites set months ago closed June 30th planned. wanted extended federal government moving different testing systems giving money states instead keeping current sites open.

NY reporting record numbers lol wat. 

California already started reporting Record Numbers early June, far see repercussions surge protests. 

We literally know fact tracers come reports saying protests caused surges. Pretty much everyone wore masks even lot wore goggles. 

Know wear masks? people rural states packed beaches month straight. reason rural areas hit spikes worst right now. Houston *does* bad right now, outlier comes city's current infection rates. 

Los Angeles's County one lower per capita new case rates today California.

Turn cnn, gonna iight keep wearing masks like dummy 😂😂😂😂 always win :) love President take security team.. think Trump gets power? He's poster child misinformation This. GREAT example.

That's thing that's infuriating this. convoluted complex thing stay safe, would least make sense people making effort. wearing mask? literally putting piece damn fabric mouth nose. That's it. no, ""muh freedoms"" thought read Brazil grossly undercounting deaths. could number real? people wear mask make uncomfortable wear mask feel like weird one they'll mask.

Just start fining wear one. “Thanks attending KKK rally, ordered quarantine next 14 days.

MDs supposed smart.  That's I'm avoiding stuff even though reopened. trust people keep end bargain.   little lackies want either. overgrown manchild throw temper tantrum it, followers think too.

We're long year everyone. Good luck, may odds ever favor.  know what’s crazy Trump told groupies serious shutting could do- would listened! people believe leader believe anything says. There's theory little surprise visit hospital months ago plasma infusions, presumably proceed travel precious rallies. interest looking [Houston area day, crazy.

They managed get positive rate around 3% month 10%! everyone starts wearing masks

Spoiler: won't. Yea, experience there. MIL response team lead hospital first SARS outbreak early 2000s, freaking one. recall city less 20 cases, size live, well 1000, amazing actually coming together community accomplish. People already seemed forgotten pandemic ongoing see lot people wearing masks. go stores require now. reasonable example China March. Thanks buddy. hope you. love reasons shutting everything would tank economy. though hundreds thousands dead people wouldn't????? Common Sense Dan Carlin. pedantic, would reducing R0. tiresome... I've responded keeps getting automodded dont know what's triggering it. Username partially checks out.

Also happy cake day  thing is, even shut every single thing right 100% compliance, 1 week lag time case identification death, 2 3 week lag time cases caught today death recovery. 

And grows exponentially, find current peak (assuming shut right now) extrapolate ~2 weeks exponentially (or however current trends indicate) compared earlier peak. could take earlier peak go back ~2 weeks compare now. we’re higher back 2 weeks earlier peak, peak worse. don’t least regional lockdowns, people don’t start taking seriously, also worse. 

Also since much testing back then, we’d expect lower test percent positive now. great we’re testing, you’d look absolute number positives make direct comparison.  like aesthetic look people wearing masks show.

Fucking hilarious Social distancing important mask... dumb understand anything anyway... hope not. It’s harder spend money (for me) it’s cash hand over. Swiping card, using something like Disney’s Magic Band, makes less tune much something costing. Whenever go see less quarter people masks makes angry wish full Wuhan style authoritarian lockdown. Fuck grown children wanting miss treats conveniences talking mom phone earlier today, talking potentially taking short family trip Labor Day, assuming coronavirus would done. laughed staff trying tell people joking, later went front cameras say wasn’t kidding. prepared. Multiple presidents stockpiled set agencies handle this. one came along swept preparation away. Drain rewamp Imagine saying cuck unironically. Texas really trying count deaths, simply guess ratio undercounted. know infections undercounted, there's huge possible range too. know deaths 3+ weeks infections, guess far testing delayed infection based contact tracing - know nothing, probably either - immature outbreak huge impact. 

California exactly issues.

For states, could probably get decent death count excess mortality. deaths overwhelmingly higher baseline, much larger error would applied almost anywhere else.

I'm sure hung Texas' IFR. afraid twice high everywhere else poor individual health? reason believe would different Belgium, best data? It’s funny “law order” dumb fucks use logic. “Patriot”: *checks Fox News* ... masks form tyranny, COVID China’s fault Trump saved us it, white lives matter, antifa terrorists everyone protesting injustice antifa, ... TRUMP 2020!

America: ima head out. There’s money pizza kitchen. Good luck. watched live streams Disney Springs Universal? Even limited capacity ""gUiDeLiNeS"" social distancing totally impossible. People wear masks correctly, eating drinking stop expelling germs over. people can't stay 2 feet away, much less six feet (which even 2 meters). scary watch. Well thank you. Lol Seriously...it needed happen sooner later. uneducated people asking it? Give ICUs operate pretty close max capacity times. beds used, staffed. anything, hospital(s) providing ICU bed space reschedule surgeries (which taking 71% occupied bed space) free beds.

The article inflammatory relying non objective thought. numbers dictate overrunning hospitals cases exclusive Covid. federal government blame management. whole effort set offload responsibility someone else (China causing states responding it), get blamed. Blame management fucking cancer.  thing UBI everybody gets whether work not. reason people want take position means taking loss. People would lining extra money could. people? what? Herd immunity anywhere 60-90% we're like 5% right Oddly enough 67% ppl getting unemployment making work....  troubling. Apparently, even small gatherings safe. Funny feel surrounded strangers worst thing going concerts. 🤷‍♂️ Conservative governors need go full Budd Dwyer fall swords. best news! Similar things reported Italy countries.

I think they'll trouble... Dallas far behind. said near top also said sneakily, Arizona obvious point case noticed, people sub capable critical thinking. know data time ago, 80% data also shown 2000 2005, national ICU occupancy rates ranged 65% 68% 2010, average national ICU occupancy rate 66% (*unpublished data*). 

 2010, hospital ICU occupancy rates 64.6% 68%, respectively. Occupancy rates vary hospital size, higher occupancy rates associated larger hospitals. 

 wonder many even get tested. probably many need lockdown stabilizers. Automatic cash injections lockdown.

It’s clear much country need return lockdown. need soften  Confederacy Dunces. similar one proves umbrellas help stay dry rain tact placed head Agreed. think NYC might actually 20% crazy.

Personally think masks bullshit cult symbols. I’d happy wear one present experimental science proving effectiveness spike? never dropped us  People chanting wrong information thought knew true. Classic Humans. taking frustrations COVID like majority idiotic Americans lmao. country politicized doesn’t mean political stance. moron? Well know access Netflix need. pandemic really shows sad people's lives are. idea actually real world. sad. Maybe. Maybe not. I'd shit ton regret going brother's wedding spreading covid elderly parents, gf's elderly parents. live little regret means protecting loved ones. sucks....Firefighters one occupation always revere wish 86 recovers fully! Oh thank god. Well that’s good know seen milder cases. Guess it’s overreaction. Let’s hope gives us information road. Holy fuck I'm anti-vaccine, cautious injecting rushed vaccine tried tested while. absolutely will, 70% commonly used accelerant wilderness firestarting.

*However* work well colder climates. Think flambe, warm pan first. Yeah haha. Thankfully Billy Burr put place. Well wearing masks. testing contact tracing infrastructure early, would've able likely keep economy open, especially people worse masks. learned Chicago, despite bickering fro. south IL insane well doing. cases steady, long ago testing state. many people really think either flat hoax blown proportion. think lot them, real concern family impacted. state (AZ) held anti mask rally scottsdale Move along virtue signaling. durr fake news” shut fuck up

bearbullhorns:  Waaaaa, shut fuck up, waaaaaa, waaaaaa I'm especially concerned colliding flu season. shit show, particularly Texas states spiking right now. Hey polled like good .001% percent US good chunk open vaguely worded question returning lockdown, people's support brainer lock feel like it. something said types people take polls. kills like .02% according CDC. Individual states still report numbers, online trackers pull states individually rather national government China revised death estimates (to include probable cases never confirmed swabs) two days released Wuhan antibody test results. think used antibody prevelance rates estimate total number cases, worked probable deaths backwards that. don’t stay home  Sounds like employers fault then. ask business open going I'd like nice break craziness able try maintain level sanity. enforced businesses. Hold business accountable they’ll actively enforce remove customer. don’t hold businesses accountable, can’t say “wear leave they’ll shut us don’t”. It’s taken debatable personal/political opinion enforced way. 😂 win I’m going waste time anymore. Must feel good idiot live orlando, work one major hospitals. orlando, near capacity. pockets florida met capacity. actually interesting confusing.

We also losing massive money didnt elective surgeries. catch 22 there... Adjusted population would 66,000 new cases US getting close double highest reported day I'm favor concert idea way plenty research validates people varying degrees physiological reactions music.

Yeah really dispute I'm sure that's true. like true people experience varying degrees physiological reactions everything.

The point I'm attempting make calling type people know gatekeep unless felt won’t understand

This screams like he's type dude go concert walk away smug somebody says ""I great time!"" counters ""Yeah *really* enjoy like did"" really zero clue he's higher physiological response anybody else.

Also I'm ripping guy I'm annoyed he's downplaying Covid lol feel you, 5 8 year old. numbers still around (in mid July), hope continue school home. Correction: happens, fact ~~trend~~ forecast line stopped going edging upwards.

At time, despite that, line still shows net decline. ignore bit. option pay tickets higher insurance premiums. makes sense, since you’d putting insurance company higher risk nasty medical payout. article basically says it’s rare can’t definitively say cause concern. New York study 5 people it. places studied said didn’t see significant “surge” types cases. 

Now thousands people going take word use fact won’t read article. 

I’m saying risks younger people def article argument don’t coincide. It’s disingenuous say “surge” it’s also disingenuous push fear stroke article saying numbers/cases aren’t even close recognizable threat.

Edit: thanks golds whoever are. nice you. CNN already discredited ideas better treat extreme cases now. read elsewhere know it’s safe give people nasal oxygen don’t need intubation much. So, people live would noting.

Still dumb tho even debate? worst wear something kinda annoying don’t like way looks. best, saving people’s lives economy. Got officially let go today. Fuck stupid virus. already need even 2 hours transporting them. haven’t even finished first wave yet. Wait till see explosion coming. Everyone spreading around like it’s Xmas. one cares workers forced it. hate country running corporations. hope get die, screaming (as best lungs dissolving). bearbullhorns: Waaaaa, shut fuck up, waaaaaa, waaaaaa people getting infected younger. States making mistakes NY made nursing homes early days virus information now.

Interesting see happens ICU capacity reached. Bet deaths start climbing  Yeah. I'm still angry Fauci even tacitly giving 18 month timeline vaccine development bypassing FDA vaccination protocols. undermines trust non-crazies doctors providing factual, trustworthy information. face US response Covid misleading really pisses off. I'm glad mostly went unnoticed, kind thing ends people trusting medical advice vaccination masks future. did! That's learned it, I've never actually Houston. mean that's still real concern. Improper usage PPE worse PPE all.

Case point - people wear one pair gloves day.

With little bit discipline, pretty easy touch face. would never think say God bless him. sucks apparently Parrot Mafia pandemic proof. kind business it? acquaintance lost bar bought year ago (which probably explains it, still settling basically) It’s 3-5 hour drive next metropolitan area. ambulance would basically mobile ICU. mean that's still real concern. Improper usage PPE worse PPE all.

Case point - people wear one pair gloves day.

With little bit discipline, pretty easy touch face. bearbullhorns: Waaaaa, shut fuck up, waaaaaa, waaaaaa don’t think bar asking people share. think friends sharing amongst wait glasses free get drink. remind profile picture hahahaha mean Trump... No, really There’s pandemic going on. You’re crazy. Nah, stop singling ones right. issue 35%  Probably 90% attractions indoors Ny currently 300k active cases 300 listed serious condition. Go USA tab, NY tab, scroll up. One would think would headline news hoping pleads people start wearing masks taking seriously. whole plan open hope people social distancing wear masks obviously happening. plan basically whole group people need step act differently plan. pipe dream. solution ever worked ever, mitigates blame. Florida get face gators...UPF sun protection breathable. best disease better nothing. is, tour tribute him. new album lot unreleased voice tracks lot guest artists. extremely excited last summer. support another lockdown, also think extend $600 unemployment benefits make sure taken care of. U.S. richest country world. afford take care people, contrary Mitch McConnell might say. always find way bail corporations. Bail US out.  don’t know. Go catch it? Validate skepticism? 

Maybe hop Reddit while? Sorry OOTL, what's MSM? 

And I'm guessing long 90 people outside wearing masks exposure risk bad

Although personally risk thrilled people did(I think there's safer ways like using car/signs/honking)  Wait, haven’t set covid specific wards? That’s like asking ICU patients get covid top whatever put hospital. Reminds OC covid meeting. people vote reproduce. Idiocracy documentary.  Admittedly read article I'm little confused group adults even sharing drinks begin with. look college age, keg-stand ice-luge group, aside maybe occasional sip ONE friend can't imagine heck even doing. 

Ew, even non-COVID times, that's ""no"" me.  agree you. mask issue one part thing do. 

Cleaning hands public places. coughing sneezing surfaces, distancing, etc. 

It's masks masks like easiest thing IMO. yahoo.com may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage, post automatically removed. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

Somewhere 1 2: stimulus bill make sure money flow markets. 2 trillion dollars baby.  110 today heat index FL. Nobody going outside. Summer like North’s winter. Pussies.  think nailed it. beginning, much uncertainty idea temporary, relatively brief lockdown learned sensible idea. know isn’t bubonic plague, also seen detrimental side lockdowns Rubio excelled flying radar since 2016, nowhere near Reddits least favorite.

Rubio wanted poster boy new GOP laid ""postmortem"" following 2012, said need relax dogwhistling stop depending old whites.

Rubio going perfect poster boy new GOP, GOP became Trump cult. day someone weaponizes virus means control entire global population, royally fucked Mad! Let others slowly wither die We're get number? one asked Apologies picking Nijmegen, picked random city closer border. part world yet, though hope soon. (after over)

For regions hope possible extent move patients around ensure best possible intensive care.

The main operating problems different region are:

* US open, roadways far normal traffic loads.
* Considering pace growth region would questions scalability well.

With many new hospitalized patients travel distance 100+ km longer (200+ going directions) really doubt affected areas able move everyone needs moved. much likely scenario seems overflow improvised hospitals nearby less intensive cases go, transitioning entire hospitals/major wings towards COVID care. I'd curious hear conversations hospitals sound like area whether triage strategies discussed. chance containing locked months organize worldwide effort lock everything time. then, organize testing contact tracing, along quarantines. countries well country (like South Korea, example). Others, like US China, half-assed even regions simultaneously. Hell, US, we're still testing adequately, forget contact tracing. Americans that. even wear masks. solution. way contain this, point, late. Cultures change dime, even Europe Asia right thing eradicated there, still North South America fucking them, we'd happen borders opened.

At point, plead people wear masks whenever possible, hope eventually, enough hospitals get overrun, enough people die, populations previously ignored science finally take notice right thing. point, it'll far late save people died previous folly, maybe deaths avoided. Brown lightly sides first, guess. difference hurricane definite end, see damage leaves wrecks town. opinion telling people lock close businesses livelihoods indefinitely 99% people going fine getting virus, MUCH harder. giant protests government people less letting happen, mention squandering initial lockdown, don’t see political capital again. wish people would stop blaming masks everything, shit absorb eyes parts body Agreed that, issues fine? FDA? HHS? FBI? It’s much easier enforce local level. Even state level, you’d create new positions investigate issue citations? done locally, cops could issue fines. Federally, would nightmare. Well spend half trillion financial oversight primary stimulus goes major corporations put stock market price employees, it’s hard trust won’t act like it’s possible. administration pass much hardship onto average Joe possible point. Trump already got win signing name onto checks pretend like he’s personally us service, doubt he’s keen another one point. wants reopen, stop testing completely, let peasants die must.

Here couple results literally seconds searching...

We going get hit double whammy stagflation rate. study lie? maybe missed something fucking protest lockdown???Americans real joke nice one 30000 + deaths isnt joke:') virus leak lab.

Got proof statement implying virus leaked lab? coincidences possibly, mean good hard proof Happy Birthday! Make sure proper precautions taken aestheticians. Maybe wash hair prior going salon, skip blowout, minimize time. felt pretty safe salon appointments establishments salon, us 2. I’m NE state that’s seen good numbers. know exercises degree exercise, feeling like I’m already gonna get come September elementary school full time similar boat. Kid born March. incredibly tough. Hard enough take care baby normal circumstances, crazy. 

We're black sheep family travel across state lines, one hotspot another, grandparents finally meet little one. 

For reason personal sense whatever important health safety grandchild. programming language it? India (slow) exponential growth since day locked down. single sustained decrease confirmed cases, ever. now, months later, curve starting grow ""big"" numbers, that's exponential growth works.

Those numbers could drop overnight, Indian people would Chinese - stay home 2 months, except one designated person per household going every days food &amp; medicine, government gets serious quarantine positive cases, symptomatic not. 

But takes lot coordination ensure food available people stay in, PPE avilable must go out. people need actually follow rules, government-approved exceptions.

Otherwise, same.

And India - America like this, too. Trump going big numbers again. Lol got miningitis COVID? confirmed health care specialist? Yeah also opened early. Hey Florida numbers growing larger every day yet still talking sending back school ok open Busch gardens universal. Disney wants reopen July.. truely insane Okay, 180,000 Americans dead October

Lmaoo guys we're taking FATTEST L possible volunteer tribute? obvious early bad. China eliminated like 6 weeks? know assume lied deaths seems likely didn’t bend numbers much. Probably reported like places counted confirmed covid deaths testing wasn’t rapid enough. Regardless though forced isolation significantly better anything anywhere else did. 

Does government want lock people apartments? No. stop virus? Yes. 

I bet westerns would okay barricaded home 4 weeks meant thing gone :p Im south bay (SJ) , time ever see anyone without mask hiking trails around complex Concidering majority victims rich importantly black, care. exercises, unless really want powerlift lol What's sad story couple days ago thing happening Cali family reunion... 20 people infected.

People ignoring want hear point. Terrible unless lucky enough union, which, uncommon state. come subreddit become mainly US? Covid effects almost every nation planet yet majority top articles US related. used cover different parts world seems states. sounds like cheat code never getting elected again. blame 0.01% Americans , blame whole lot could pretty much calculate deaths cases right ? headed towards another shutdown suppose get worse winter months? Tbf live music good crowd amazing experience. They're spot there.

They spot needing needing now. That's plain stupid. They're gonna get people killed indirectly.  ... thought saying stupid things said needed slow testing speech. think actually going close testing sites. honest heard infectious disease experts predict Armageddon past felt simply pushing agenda research funds. dramatic war worlds scenario, except HG Wells story ended dramatically bacteria killed invader. “How could happen us?” Superspreader events almost indoors. seen quote 18 times likely catch virus superspreader event indoors versus outdoors. they're slaves, slaves tired monitored day spending 2 hours commuting day.

They want respite wage slave realities. reason 80% Japanese people want stay working home too.

People tired slaves, almost nothing 'rona. one thinks way estimated? Try doubling number. Maybe even triple since school session.

RemindMe! October 1st, 2020 mean fair, sitting close people wearing masks quite bit different people outdoors moving constantly wearing masks fully expect go along when, right surgical procedure, surgeon tells everyone take masks stop sheep. asshole. ridiculous. need ride freedom rules, mask crap. Ah, feeling might suggesting. ""I cough, I'm going stay home, rather risk getting sick.""

That's would taken. wife driving home evening said may normal Wednesday evening commute traffic freeway. taking 20 mins right covid work took usual 45 must dispel notion virus harmful working age population. face masks work, make old people wear them.

But time, right, I'd appreciate smaller US population well. LOVED backed traffic freeway. LOVED able get gas station market. I'll first admit I'm selfish asshole. I'm also wrong. Exactly, math NYC see nymber bullshit. 180,000,lol. report downgrading hidden reporting/not reported cases easily already 150k more... thing end taking 1 million US lives people ignorant real dangers face country. Ding ding ding. Conservatives right wingers harped “less government!”, de-regulation, big tax cuts big corporations &amp; wealthy decades. 

So voila. Here’s “less government” action. It’s absolutely wrong thing country needs deadly pandemic. hospitals failing, can’t afford pay people stay safe &amp; stay home, testing infrastructure abysmal, economy collapsed, real leadership White House, leadership wants ignore crisis turn one measures would keep us safe (wearing face masks!) divisive political issue, COVID spreading rapidly entire country.

Here’s “less government”. Isn’t swell. point plain simple: USA win Second World War alone. Someone could even argue allies could without assistance USA. Breaking news: politicians decide live terrorist attacks killing hundreds every day.

If sounds insane right covid? Serious question, obviously public wear masks, small friend gatherings without masks infrequently? N95's emergency use go bad unless molded damaged mechanically. expiration os date manufacturers ceases warranty standards likelihood improper storage.

Buy one, now. Things gotten sane again. hope young people show vote.

Good luck that. California realized bad idea was, given Florida it. cut headline ""October 1"" today acquaintance complain family cancelled trip Myrtle Beach, how's he's sitting home months.

Yeah, have. special. let go long hug spending 101 days apart coronavirus. story Guido Stangalini, 100 years old, wife Maria Pagani, 93 years old, married 70 years originally Castano Primo province Milan (Italy). ""Due Guido's walking difficulties - explains Giuseppe Pignatiello, mayor Castano Primo, knows couple well - beginning year couple decided go live Guanella retirement home town first move February Guido himself"". Guido one couples old-fascion, everything together - says mayor - many years marriage never experienced long separation, days must seemed like eternity"". Look red eagle soar freedom! Whip Big Macs rifles everyone, ‘Merica! likely. I'm guy sitting top speaker tower earplugs, hearing protector full face mask P100 filters. I'll fine. blame govt everything. can't reverse 70 years deplorable health care infrastructure spending 100 days efforts they? Churches, bars food packaging places seem prime breeding grounds Covid. sure gyms also list haven’t heard massive outbreaks one. long tree still stands, Greg Abbot die. That's based idea welfare abuse rampant tons/everyone wants lazy moocher. There's never widespread abuse found programs created find/stop it(often costing little abuse find does).

Businesses right exist, UBI threatens shitty jobs corps automate/eliminate first chance viable improve bottom line. Yeah, one wants make shit hamburgers $10 hour to, maybe $2 hamburgers handed 5min.

I really think percentage people *never* anything UBI would break double digits. even half world wants sit couch day everyday, fine, really care. Productivity would still probably increase, way anymore. Girl bye! Ted Cruz least favorite. Hell, maybe even Rand Paul. Tell friend scarring lungs severely reduced lung capacity. 26 years old, non smoker, obese. 

Now tell boss requiring back office, even numbers infections hospitalizations rise. Even though I’d working home productively months. risk may small, it’s still real it’s still pointless. honest, Fox News. Media attention shifted protests. realize much media impacts reaction events taking place around us.  I'll take thots  And, confirmed ny authorities, numbers are, least week *behind*, goverment testing people almost confirmed it. Jokes you, lots people drink coke instead water hundreds thousands dead people

When Corona kills people, killing best. killing you. killing you. killing people lots problems, bringing problems us. They’re bringing obesity. They’re bringing diabetes. They’re immunocompromised. some, assume, good people. self-cleaning, worries. window visit them. stay inside, stand outside, use phones. around 120k dead, however death rate isnt bad yes spike cases deaths skyrocket bad virus worked way nursing homes young adults. still expect country wont handle well eitherway. feel they're salty want blame CA ""not letting them"" reopen, ALSO feel can't explicitly complain, clearly prudent allow theme parks reopen given current explosion community spread general failure give sufficient fucks American public.

This letter reads like trying make clear shareholders WANT reopen, big bad california let them....while also trying piss non-shareholders brain. finally came! cynical am, still want family day. 2 thirds mission already completed Contagion way LESS scary, government actually came across competent, quick act. Congratulations! hope everyone stays healthy well life. don’t understand mean that. need put purchase order ice trucks body bags. That's nyc dealt overflow. Reality even wanted to, can't cross border right now. friend lives New Jersey trying convince go Austin him. I'm like man I'd love physically can't. comprehend meant. explain border literally closed dude, where've last 3 months haha? guys even realize there? antitrust major companies thousand pieces. really funny might still alive. anyone care.  120,000 families surge protests yet arrived. crock. country turning joke. Postmodern, post-truth politics created post-truth government creating post-truth society thank much hate I’m part! hope. testing bottleneck point though. Oh ffs says article read it

the CDC clearly stated number subject change. 

You probably read article. media outlet took weird spin headline. different scenarios variety outcomes..26% one them.

Not disagreeing government lying a**es headline bullshit. does, even didn't, major casino groups started putting announcements mandatory masks couple hours this. That's part problem. Everyone assumes since death rate low there's nothing worry about. That’s point Special Ed different situation average kid.  Also, class sizes usually smaller makes slightly safer. Fair enough, you’re right say I'm still confused reading article.

Was canceled may proved Wuhan origin story false? canceled kind partnership foreign scientists? even supposed mean? Purdy please cherry top? American exceptionalism finest. leaders really thought could never happen us.  yet, put lot effort exact opposite. think plays large role vaccinations aren’t guarantee, that’s outside limited knowledge Seriously nobody saying things outside home. saying WANT accurately respond without getting thread locked?  previous lockdown nothing test, American people failed. lockdowns proven inefficient. long run, worth cost hardship. think we're past point onto natural selection. got way self-centered irresponsible people though. failure lockdown. earthworm doesn’t need bright. People still told social distance, even without lockdowns. What's ""globe-denier""?  Delete Texas; insert Florida below. (Comment post Texas applies). sure population numbers. lazy check. Going bed fml hope best states people. 

IF virus strong hit nyc, Texas par problems. NYC reporting around 5k new cases per day mid April. 20k+ people died. Many deceased nursing homes (credit Gov Cuomo). maybe specific factor offsets ultimate number deaths Texas protecting elderly, Texas still trouble. 

As far population, Texas 3x many people nyc. Given area size Texas, logic, sure new cases evenly distributed across state. 

But pattern continues repeat Wuhan, Italy, NYC, etc... Texas states bad trip - hope not, numbers lie pattern used predict outcome accurately. 

Godspeed, Floridians. Exactly. Look picture jellyfish exhibit Monterey bay aquarium. Pretty cool huh

Now can, go see it. one amazing things ive ever seen person. 

Onlines same. Im saying people go shit yet. “They know, don’t care” -Florida batman one! I'll provide soon post peer-reviewed paper demonstrates via experimentation Americans certain persuasion *cough* actual humans functional cognition.

It's probably best devise non-destructive experiments, case positive result found. Oh shit really wanna see that!! normal internet, mobile, would still expensive. care long part number  You’re problem think GOP isn’t cancer country right TOP 5 NEW CASES USA

1. Texas +6,177 *NEW RECORD*
2. Florida +5,511 *NEW RECORD*
3. California +4,966
4. North Carolina +2,384 *NEW RECORD*
5. Arizona +1,795


Worldometers counting system denying California 7k number. Florida apparently letting numbers get big week bury next week miracle July 4 turnaround narrative. 

Great move DeSantis.  instead using precious time bought lockdowns, federal government actively antagonized efforts prepare country divided polarized us process. Shortage mustard. I'm scientist think since coming China would take 'wait see' attitude. Time fire triage tents, suppose. Funny thing mention that. true. wrote also works especially them. challenge someone based ADA protection allow access legit (hint: verify are) sued oblivion. bullshit liars sue? don’t to. threat sued win.

Yes stores offer outside curb service. every business offer curbside swiveling (think service like salons, etc) think cases region one thousand now? One computer wizards need make cut dangerous fingers ears denial cowardly shit Fox News said March. It’s going hurt getting slapped face dick. Yeah, I've seen people claim actual death toll super-low, hospitals flagging anyone dies COVID-19 death money...

...but seem struggle bring [CDC's Excess Deaths tracks number people died causes compares number deaths we'd normally expect see, something long history fairly accurate, showing we've 111,720 - 154,575 deaths expected.

Now, things getting better, good thing!

......we'll see shakes coming weeks. really giving lower incomes first   Sounds safe one make it. anyone flying in? driving long distances? Public bathrooms really iffy... power and/or water many cases, travel central parts community food water regularly, increasing exposure. Cuomo least wants people coming states quarintine. accepting minor inconveniences like masks lower risks, willing lose family’s livelihood, access shelter, food, health care it. thought lungs - type wash..... Nope! Stores absolutely allowed ask customers, “customer” doesn’t want share, they’re required share. 

But!

Either way store allow access. ADA requires accommodate person way allow individual avail services, specifically creates risk others. keeps wheelchairs narrow caves prone flooding, example. keep wheelchair guy dying, keep everyone else getting stuck behind water rises. 
They might offer someone carry him, make accommodations, absolutely can’t take wheelchair whether reveals ailment not. 

At grocery store, stores/mask-disability-fakers emotional-support-ponies opt curbside pickup. There’s court that’s going say getting groceries isn’t adequate accommodation grocery store. 4 months this. letting 'elective' procedures surgeries. 

Thats beds 97% right now. huge backlog. think it’s seeing loved ones people comes “ living life”... whether family friends... Zoom fatigue real nothing like real thing. That's last thing want. mandating masks saying PoCs free wear masks without consequence. People different experiences. black person, wearing mask kind, increases risk getting shot police non-negligible amount. black, would happy requirement wear one. government encourages mask wearing, require it. That's fair compromise. Well us. northeast still decent shape. least now. Oh also biggest threat black lives right COVID-19, that’s statistical fact already tweedle dumb tweedle dumber running country. blame Trump massive protests wearing masks done token feeling safe?? That’s false. go out. Social distancing masks work. They’re fucking stupid. theme sub China = great job lol Restaurants bars. Damn dude people like shit. Whats fucking problem shitty thing? going impossible change ""x"" amount hearts/minds.

So, 8/10 people wear mask, case/death numbers spike (because ""80%"" mitigation)...the 20% going say right along, wear mask, they'll keep practicing dangerous behavior prolong even longer.... (not all) hospitals allowing birthing partners. (again all) making birthing/support partners leave baby born. support person fever, allowed hospital. mother would give birth without support person.

Meanwhile, people taking seriously recently earlier month parties, hugging, cramming bars, going beaches, otherwise carrying like none happening.

I've got explanation this. crazy me. know people want over, end result pretending past us either going MANY deaths another full lockdown. think people would damn foresight. actually start clinical trial medication autoimmune disease (alopecia, nothing serious) around beginning pandemic drug immunosuppressant time, immune response issues COVID-19 widely reported, thought would bad idea. 

I already starting ease keto! I'm cutting carbs ramping fats proteins week go in, avoid ketosis shock whatever, keep eye gallbladder case. Last thing need right hospital trip lol. I'm getting older, need keep fiber intake mind. Ok well long don’t think it’s anything we’re getting somewhere. we’re claiming don’t believe things it’s convenient, don’t believe people like exist. You’re probably foreign bot account. get it, easy! fun too! federal government deliberately coordinate response trumps orders. 100 percent federal government organize national response. know Florida attempting remove cases deaths stats approach July 4th weekend. Watch numbers move next days. You’re right. One worst thing lockdowns ended pointless. Total shutdowns nothing ended early. Look Canada see happens lockdown done right lifted based science. back square one let politics guide decisions. Yeah 65% people represent 48% electoral college, are.

Sorry, no. I'm acting healthy skepticism towards people who've demonstrated they're perfectly willing risk lives millions personal, political, professional gain. too. like everyone talking second wave.

To even second wave kinda need stop first wave first. Otherwise big fucking first wave. blame one doctor five doesn’t seem recommend anything hygienic. DEADLY

We first covid death month last week, beginning phase restrictions.. Everything counterintuitive harmful. Given 35 percent people thought Obama gay lizard Martian Muslim, I’m pretty sure know rest responded. RBT? I'm situation center work at. type event could possibly change constitutionality lockdowns. death toll gets think will, could absolutely see general public sentiment changing. shortly going become essentially impossible claim hoax ""just flu"".

And happens, Amendment might possible. Well that’s unusual! Maybe we're aware. grandmother lost sense smell flu teenager lived beyond 80, sense fear permanent damage back then. always small chance young people die flu. That's downplay nasty awful virus is; I'm trying figure sub always downplays dismisses shred good news indications behaves like previous coronaviruses, dog-piling every bad indicator. Dr. Fauci savior sub optimism vaccine completely dismissed. get it. OMG California good early nothing! guess we’ll see tomorrow. don’t trust half staff right thing even aren’t pandemic. dont like told do, yet love dictate others. Good. I’m done country.  Social Darwinists! I'd love quarantine. missed day work I'm among handful people wearing masks sanitizing workstation daily. 2.2m, absolute worse case scenario. Like, one even washed hands.

Different organizations numbers much closer 180,000 even March. Without lockdown, situation goes one direction - worse worse.

There bodies streets Texas next month won’t shit it. They’re definitely going cancel NBA season reboot right? can’t imagine making athletes leave families go play physical sport current Covid epicenter. [He's got serious damage control start Well huge state many different ideologies.

Areas like San Diego SF pretty contained, LA OC driving numbers due density public transit.

Per capita CA still awful. Lack education. Poisonous politics. Tribalism. least stocks surge investors *morons*. Children generally anything even resembling complete control diets.

In addition, people taught manage caloric intake/exercise habits culture health much US.

I think much complicated saying ""her choice"" overweight. Highly contagious? Yes, proper precautions reduce transmission risk pretty dramatically 

Deadly? Mostly you’re elderly immune compromised. grandparents elders going, respect social distancing much possible, I’m sure will.

Go wedding self quarantine feel need to, you’ll regret forever don’t Well gonna need provide sources gonna say wrong. know 35% are. sympathized nazis 30s. Supported believed Joe McCarthy 50s. Still supported Nixon resigned. Trump’s “Base”. Stupids. address needs done them, continue problems drive us extinction. plant usually shuts week July. Due everything going on, they’re actually working 6 days throw week. don’t think dispute 11,000 new cases past days. cuz compare worse case doesn’t mean Florida well thought still lock down, still lockdown? month it? lost afraid. Arizona's incompetence ironically might keep record safe today since managed test 8,000 people.

not sure going get there.... Cali done reporting? Can't wait inject something body called ""Operation Warp Speed"" financially go lockdown again. already unemployed struggling find work. start fining idiots throwing huge graduation parties etc.  lockdown dont risk spike, first wave over. fact, lets lockdown wave over, thenwe talk locking second, third forth wave inevitable country.  Protests police violence important, getting haircut not, complicated man. Well Facebook social media. perfectly knowledgeable friend totally convinced wearing masks harm breathing bacteria. would hope chef would take clean spoon, use spoon mouth. That's do. Deaths always lag new cases 2 weeks. known since March. Calling AlloStim vaccine misleading. live human cell line delivered another person akin bone marrow transplant. opinion, short term safety studies enough demonstrate safety product mass administered population order ""vaccinate"" pathogen(s). new technology surely profound unforeseen consequences (immune disorders, auto-immune diseases, GvHD, cancers, etc.). 

&amp;#x200B;

Most Covid vaccine candidates fall different set brand new technologies: Plasmid-DNA vaccines Virus vector vaccines. work similar fashion, insert new sections DNA human's cells (genetically engineering them) make cells produce foreign virus proteins, cell lines continue rest human's life (barring mutations death cell-line). severe known consequences vaccines observed animal models (severe immune response leading organ failure, severe auto-immune disease, systemic inflammatory conditions). way reverse genetic change cells. more, potential body become completely desensitized foreign protein resulting complete inability mount immune response pathogen future. also permanent. virus vector vaccines, specific virus vector utilized vaccine treatment, body mount response vector never used genetic treatment. could prevent candidates otherwise proven therapies genetic disorders able cured disorders. 

This whole rush create vaccine disease pandora's box could lead worse outcomes setting mass vaccination campaign brand new technology.  amazes people obsessed bullshit would count mask wearers. know selfish want gyms open up. I’m legally blind don’t like running neighborhood shit ton cases snakes people getting bitten snakes. 

I wish gyms would open half capacity, Force people wear masks gloves temperature taken entering. 

Just rant virus Costco 2 weeks ago felt much safe. one cares anymore, noses out, masks (employees too). employee removed mask scream colleague across store. fucked. dunno hell wrong people. love science immunity system? Sure, except they’re period rapid decline, whereas FL period rapid growth.  test ;) I’m genuinely furious I’m forced work this. American “leadership” got lot Americans killed, many die pandemic subsides. lot people would still alive we’d responsible administration charge. So... quite two-thirds supermajority ... definitely three-quarters supermajority. We're f*cked. stop pesky testing.

How else think able graduate Wharton?

Fred Trump Sr: ""Stop giving tests pass him. know option. pay handsomely"" Lol “people like me”. 

I’m literally asking point testing services point, since initial importance saw gone. Thanks points. Good know. Kinda sick bullshit tbh. blowhard clue, evidenced understanding previously implemented countermeasures (ie stay home orders, social distancing, self quarantine etc) helped flatten normally distributed curve result lead death count less prior projections hence projections keep changing near daily basis based upon current measures implemented time.


Edit: word   like said multiple times ordered to. said definitely wasn’t kidding it. Holy shit pandemic handed election blew it. Imagine us like countries opening rn better yet never even go lockdown. Tbh thought ego would made handle better. Instead he’s doubling worst way every time

Imagine properly provided working class quarantine gave unifying speeches together gonna beat thing. We’re Americans gotta fight together instead waging war guns well use masks fight thing. Dude woulda landslide live Greensboro. mandatory masks people take seriously. really depends are. Smaller urban areas like Fayetteville Greensboro generally fine big cities like Charlotte Raleigh pretty bad. flew Charlotte weeks ago masks almost non existent. Well, wasn’t really point wasn’t point. saying protests driving force behind numbers going up. saying protests certainly driving bit lions share source ballooning numbers people getting sick work extended periods time breathing recycled air. 

On whether economy feasibly stay closed? course not. Everything would collapse. it’s hard truth pandemic gonna make us suffer nonessential jobs open. It’s necessary evil, hindsight show path greater evil several hospital systems get overrun dams break. 

I’m type person ignore reality like lot people do. there’s reason kinda tone.  Yeah, sticking 4,500 coronavirus patients nursing homes effect elderly patients all. Google treatment gotten better lol. honestly think one learned anything 6 months? Smdh state state basis, makes sense. Locking whole country New York outbreak monumentally stupid. Isnt stimulus buyouts big businesses supposed AVOID? Universal Basic Income seems reality. love god hope right gets extended. trying rebuild life past 3 years new state post-horrendous divorce choice leave everything move back home state father. fucking sad. I'm 33 still trying get life together. husband got brought back lay-off today. actually cried happy tears. He’s different position old job opens back up, he’s getting pay. We’ll still frugal af case gets laid agai second wave. it’s really crappy week needed this. Read corroborating reports Italy. Even elderly people getting sick. speculate virulent strain virus selected out. second shutdown, necessary be, never happen. It’s become clear country fragile house cards. order keep collapsing, keep economy open, even means sacrificing thousands people. many us scared scientifically illiterate enough would rather pretend pandemic save lives lost this. could new fall Rome. honestly soon. Average time show symptoms five days, even developed symptoms quickly I’d assume people, especially people wouldn’t run get test first sign sniffle. I’m sorry. got called back 2 weeks ago. one wearing masks distancing. work Best Buy people getting don’t tell anyone they’re exposed anything. don’t follow enforce rules. hope better job work. number explode. Oh, here's something mayo know may standards degree Trump U many people saying got smart hombres Except unknowingly spreading parents/grandparents/immune compromised friends much higher chance end end bankrupt hospital bills dead. Thank you! don’t get goofballs wear masks say they’re protecting me. someone digs peer reviewed paper him, also find one says smashing fucking balls claw hammer every night bad future procreation chances! bunch dudes called dumbass night. don’t smash shit balls, kids, I’ve never seen evidence peer reviewed paper fucking devastating nuts oblivion reason that. I’m toughening sperms kids won’t pussies. Anyway, show papers masked goofs! study five people?! kidding right now? 5 people. stop. Stop spreading fear stop doubling someone calls it. Stock Market going love this. Lock shit down. 

Irresponsible states going kill thousands. No, actually I’m economist geographer. Maybe little fun you, Houston blew it. going reopening phases two months ago people would patience financial stability endure rolling shutdown figured virus hiding causing spread. could better protected critical care facilities (40% fatalities now). could done things system margin.

Now, people unemployed 1980s, federal aid running 30 days health care capacity - daily new cases order magnitude higher started first place.  tell business community care many times run exponential formula Excel - going want know **you know** shutting going different agree again. already know models proven bullshit (see Neil Ferguson glorious record accuracy), social distancing came high school science project - rejected DA Henderson CDC (he eliminated smallpox BTW) 2006 thought would never work. There’s reason similar measures weren’t tried pandemic subsequent 1918, either.

Personally, would give two weeks shutdown restart health care system I’d want know you’re going isolate protect vulnerable contact trace infections success 35% NYC getting Rn. Otherwise, I’m taking chances - don’t trust people power react reasonably without panic hysteria. much testing. guys winning soon post this, known eating shit. Goddamn americans actual dipshits?! took mask wearing seriously like countries lockdown bad is. Yep sure thing friend. 👍🏻 Even ""mainstream"" conspiracies like vaccine developed quickly inevitably lead brain damage twenty years, usual ""Big Pharma want know taking vitamin cure this,"" mask bullshit... Fuck you, cancer. many billion? This. acute respiratory symptoms february. sick 4 weeks early stages gp complete covid denial. come country on.

They admitted 2 weeks ago likely it, well geee.

No lung organ damage seems im damn tired time. barely make hours without wanting sleep. Looks like reopening going well! North Florida... stupid people everywhere June 3rd 500k+ people protesting, shoulder shoulder, San Francisco. 3 weeks definitely it. Hey Rodd, think emotes looking are: 😢😒 I’m down. can’t seem see day higher today

(Although data hasn’t reached week yet) Two million social distancing. 100-250k August moderate social distancing. Trump adminstration’s numbers March track far. NY currently around 300k active cases around 300 listed serious. Go click USA tab, click New York scroll up. places saying seeing less severity patients would assume NY giving us best view what's going active cases almost 200k state. not. fucking weirdest spam account Europe successful.

Health insurance tied employment.

Governments paid salaries companies fire people.

They got testing tracing running. made masks mandatory.

Americans need better leadership hopefully makes clear direction need go it...

Hopefully citizens realize cast ballots shrew**D**ly instead hitting mo**R**ons. Im reading comments see posted mask wearing two things.

There reduced chance breathe cant touch mouth nose. Even though know can't tell many times I've caught reaching public realized. go like CHAZ did? study concludes that: 
""The infection fatality rate COVID-19 vary substantially across different
locations may reflect differences population age structure case-mix infected deceased patients well multiple factors. 
Estimates infection fatality rates inferred seroprevalence studies tend much lower original speculations made early days pandemic.""

Your bad analysis probably knowing talking about. stop trying sell bad analysis here. 

I'm sure family think genius.

PS Everyone knows PEOPLE RECOVER FINE covid-19, dimwit.  RISK uncontrolled spread 5% people NEED MEDICAL HELP can't get healthcare system flooded.

Hence ""flatterning curve""

This right literally every government face planet right now. job all. make bad situations seem bad means necessary. includes bullshitting daily good old lying teeth. Seems way low me. We're entirely trusting numbers coming states right -- there's likely lot hiding cooking numbers going on.  That’s sentiment got us mess. Yea, agreed. One friends ems driver New York month helping out. LA checking - seems like people don’t care here. go work downtown now, seems bustling, commuter train full, mask compliance seems iffy best. say maybe 60% train wears mask. apartment complex grocery store, I’ve never seen anyone make effort distance others. always amazed see conclusions politically motivated people understanding statistics come get bold enough share insanity internet. Fractal ignorance. Rhode Island started whole state issue. extent, understand it, realistically Northeast way interconnected states act separately. New York City major hub, followed Boston Philly. three cities pull commuters states issue deal outside DC Boston corridor (with exceptions like Chicago Kansas City). nuke it? CEOs incapable performing small task hospital. deserve $500k?? October 1 before, after, speculated time “second wave”? death toll projection keeps falling initial estimates furthermore, death rate falling. amendment based locking whole country chance passing. Thousands people gathering protests despite bad may one saying word them. don’t know death rate thing. know outside severe health issues nursing homes doesn’t kill many. don’t think it’s another flu death rate general populous extremely low. 85% states deaths nursing homes. come people could died anything ill already. person contracted healthy died here. catching asymptomatic people stated rarely spread ever (and walk back claim scientist said said detractors present data showing asymptomatic people spread virus isn’t any). Thanks. top I'm Florida 😞 First Florida Man. Florida Women.

Oh agree 100% USA biotechs. Public ally traded pharm companies? Yikes ...the 35% willing single-handedly solve housing crisis.  believe Texas governor explicitly said ""Enforcing masks would send people jail, look happened Dallas!""

He referencing salon owner defied EXECUTIVE ORDER county's restraining order keep opening business. 

She sent jail failing adhere restraining order, mask issue.

Now, reasoning enforce mask want ""repeat"" Dallas. 

He's doggamn idiot. country full ignorant, selfish idiots. It’s really disheartening. Meltzer gave 1¼ star. Said story good, real heat, two failed get crowd.  lived failed state, we're even close.

What fucking terminally stupid. estimate “second wave” hits? Yup. Covid first domino fall. serious SHIT right now. Even vacine comes 60 days, opened box can't shut point. Covid uncovered much fuckery economical system. Classic red herring, China's pandemic response? people keep calling herd immunity strategy. synonym defeat.  ... did. You’re spent trillions prepared ground war China nuclear attack, virus makes president less popular politically election year, sends whole thing rails... still almost 200,000 active cases FL. ppl want bad can't accept good news? odd group ppl concerned human life question everything good go absolutely nuts eat anything bad, questions asked. specifically posted negative stuff today see reactions types news. results disturbing. ppl want get bad cheering Americans death. There's self reflection it, heard mentality chopping bit. sure  ""if happening happening""

this live Make 200k!!! can't wait catches everywhere. faster happens, faster we'll past this. control, exactly? Relax Look, people getting cost living raises on!y good years.

Part reason try harder go back work baby medical issues made daycare expensive, last ten years working, four years raises 'the economy', 5 years 2 percent less raises, one year got 7 percent told (obliquely grounds go HR, ever tried negotiate would fire me, others would).

We one department carried others - always profitable never showed raises.

(Most side department followed me. still profitable, breaking laws - side kept us compliance).

But alone. job searching decade (having wrong title work mean impossible get past filters applications) friends acquaintances unless programming degree, companies less COL raises also.

When food rent goes every year, wages effectively go down, really hard save.

I 1/5 yearly salaried saved, took Herculean effort knew going try baby. also took five years pretty awful living. teach school days? people already contracted recovered it, especially asymptomatic people. get live welfare world rest lives. Shit I’d rather die covid. Get already Disney's Kingdom unfair, Mickey Mouse there! label but...i bet live bridge turn stone sunlight Yeah, feel like current government assistance situation influences results polls. basically, would rather:

1. Go back work make $500/week, or

2. Stay home, work, get $900/week government?  Yeah, rise slow June 9 15. Change new cases going ~200 day. Last 2 days raising ~1500. 12 weeks lost week. staggeringly depressing. help start wearing extra mask one already wear?  still passed Phase III, traditionally 25% success rate. approved ready production could take years.  Return? I've home since kicked us campus. like 4 months ago. Hobbies.
We need new set hobbies. I've rekindling learning play guitar, Kalimba, house repairs, gardening, hacking old consoles, learning new programming languages, going walks around neighborhood. LPT: unionize. constantly ask I’m gaslighted doctor recall correctly... viruses tend mutate less lethal versions themselves. want live host, host dies ain’t got home wish still news 24/7. mask usage late May right . . assume number daily COVID 19 deaths stays constant 775 (what right now) rest summer, US almost 194,000 deaths first day autumn. trying convince mate. Well thousand people day dying today. 60 days we’d 200k rate, September. Seems super reasonable I'm 38, line hilarious. even go 20yrs ago. feel bad masks simply aren’t necessary things can’t bad.

I feel like i'm different reality. large mountains data effective widespread mask compliance is, PLUS large mountain data quickly shit gets dire continue pandemic.

Like, people ""Feel"" way, literally data support it. 

Is gonna another case needing personally experience hell take seriously? like even tho SEE happens, LA needs happen directly believe it? Der går lidt Basken festen når jeg træder ind på baren. WTH brainwashed idiots spewing wearing mask breaking God's law???

Insane! 

This happens political party takes religion. Everything like...taxes, environmental laws, public safety laws like mask wearing becomes ""breaking God's laws"" next thing know burning political opponents stake witches agents devil! Fight virus! Wear masks! cloth masks. homemade masks! Put whatever got *UP YO GRILL (DON'T FORGET NOSE)* That’s even enough bills. Muslim. many Imams mislead people asking come inside prayers (esp. Initially), one went mask. Infact would appreciated (religiously) put women saving lives general. isn’t, it’s literally unconstitutional deny interstate travel. Hence Cuomo telling Trump would effectively declaring war NY tweeting wanted quarantine it. Swedes could little strategy could put bubble. cant. letting covid spread risking neighbours lives too. worried. hard understand? strategy might well factor brings Us ( Finland, Norway, Denmark ) Second Wave like Abbott anything stop that. ones asked quarantine per doctor orders given time so. received lot complaints mainly staff thinking didn’t care thought contracts important &amp; tried turn racist thing. :( Tbh I've seen much bullshit sides point think single one anywhere see nose spite face. July 6 see California begin enacting local lockdowns think point president convinced enough people caring people Liberal value.

 going front row seat observe collapsed hospital system modern society. neither, I've never seen many hospitals steal much government incentives. hospital uncle co -manages generating much profit making covid cases. 😂 best part people actually protecting interests. Keep believing, need ps5 soon 🤘 make Fauci president point.  “The happiest place earth” force entry level employees interact mouth breathing members society want go fucking amusement park pandemic profit. like ""think"" ""the adults room."" actuality, every bit racist Americans. Everyone US socialized healthcare. America nation earth medical debt. Right he's right. 

I guess naive think we've panic since early March, schools closed; past four months would set great planning.

Instead, benefits extended schools (at least locally) set open full first week August actual school. person said 

'a mask harm good' Fauci February 2020   average currently mid 700s declining still. Major models showing decrease least weeks slow tick back up. 

We going average 1,500 per day July, full stop.

Edit: truly understand even remotely controversial. downvotes? want downvote this, I’d love talk understand more. really thought Southern Bible States, Texas would self sufficient self governered taking care Texans... reason thought People Texas come together come one fight virus. know ""Don't Mess Texas"" Corona... seems like Corona kicking Texans ass...   constitution that? New cases popping larger numbers due kinds public events, I’m sure death rate follow. Maybe 125K died covid19 could speak up? Let's see relevant think stats are... lets get small businesses get fucked mega corporations could eat over

That's much stretch considering people getting terrorism charges actions. cases began rise claimed left loophole allows cities require businesses require customers wear mask.

That's entirely accurate. One county tried thread needle narrowly could try get around Abbot's cowardice started catching heat spike cases.

The spineless sack phlegm claimed ""They figured meant"".

Because everyone wants Dollar Tree Knockoff Riddler governor rather someone gives clear orders.  Aren’t already 100k dead? sounds like GROSS underestimate. schools open, sports start, weather keeps people indoor often guarantee number lot higher “estimate” lot money go people went repaying debts savings accounts expected, means consumer side economy bogged debt precarity pop back like under-watered daisies throw money it. Wow. fucking wow. Watch moron get re-elected too. 20% NYC infected? course there's nowhere go improvement there... 

Yes, containment outbreak definitely worked. thank god California NY did, we'd much worse place.  lack daily covid-19 White House briefings creates impression everything control. need bring Fauci back TV asap. I've working whole whole time. would looooooove another lockdown. joke dude, hurr durr.

2) Respiratory departments Hospitals ask patients screen covid first getting treated,

3) companies ask people test negative returning work. People work high-risk jobs asked get tested regularly, e.g. food delivery riders.

Sauce - Beijing Pffft! Take China!

We cases two days now.

US #1.  means Disney World's next. Here’s question ya.

Where government get money prop big businesses military?

#Miss nonsense. aint Weimar Republic money tied gold. US dollar tied imaginary value sort agree on. Money stopped leaning anything went gold standard. go suckle fossilized teat Ayn Rand Money guess Dharavi control biggest lie. There's way Dharavi put control mate that's fact. virus contagious Doh. comment removed. Q.....anon.... maybe bypasses filter? actually counterintuitive. start showing symptoms become less contagious. 


[COVID-19 Might Transmissible Presymptomatic country, rule law matter. Yay? people tired shit. Employers started laying people, cutting hours cutting salaries. Government know fuck doing.

We still pay rent, still eat.

So what's point quarantine? They'll die hunger die corona. 

At point gotta weight options. Belgium data comes serology. serology studies Texas. I’m exceedingly jealous day people live countries already locked shit process it.

The US decided say fuck it, let’s see happened numbers started shooting up, many states scrambling trying figure options. bar set low.  Great time buy college housing. least 30% students enrolling fall. least 70% plan study home. extension July 15th taxes then? I’m starting think every nation earth going build wall keep Americans out. mean ICU's 60 70 percent capacity normally. That's pretty standard. that's problem - rest beds taken COVID patients stopped elective surgeries. IHME’s analysis, based observed death rates, estimates next four months US, approximately 81,000 people die virus.

And less 3 months later 50% initial estimate. think second shutdown would much fewer protesting conservatives, point, everyone known someone died.   Oh trust me, I’m extreme universal healthcare advocate agree. human right free healthcare burdens. Agreed. It’s big enough serious numbers. Disney doesn’t want outbreak bunch staff knows many guests getting it. PR would terrible. Plus probably need certain level staffing make good experience certain level people make profitable numbers won’t allow safe operation. better staying closed. least 

## 179,107  Oh boy numbers see India insane. America Brazil hold India's beer(Gaumutra) wait watch shit show we'll in. Fuck Modi went walk. Walked house party. Walked park, go (for obvious reasons). People place, masks. Ran acquaintance. Tried keep distance. subconsciously tried close distance talk. kept backing up.

Why assume that? I’d love police enforcing it. However even making law would stop lot people saying don’t depoliticize absurd issue. Trickle economy something totally believe in, seeing we've seen happen every time there's stimulus check. Trickle down, much. live Charlotte. half people wear even want leave house go grocery store. makes mad people care others lives. want freedom? Protect others around get freedom.

Total tests - we're testing most

Total Tests per infected person - we're even close testing most

Total testing per capita - we're testing most

Daily tests - we're testing most

Daily tests per new infected person - we're testing most

Daily testing per capita - testing last 10 days so

So, testing take one specific metric last week half. NY great. population-dense city country tons travel coming hub, got hit early on. got control quickly, managing.

Im stuck thinking maybe ""blessing disguise"". america stupid? getting original thought ADA laws supersede laws phased reopening protections rights refuse service. That’s about. People abusing ADA challenge ability refuse service non mask wearers. 

It’s loopholes law allow people “medical conditions” exempt mask wearing. con use achieve it.  think anyone Australia expected ever see approval ratings like either.

Objective evaluate viral loads different stages disease progression patients infected 2019 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) first four months epidemic Zhejiang province, China.

Design Retrospective cohort study.

Setting designated hospital patients covid-19 Zhejiang province, China.

Participants 96 consecutively admitted patients laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection: 22 mild disease 74 severe disease. Data collected 19 January 2020 20 March 2020.

Main outcome measures Ribonucleic acid (RNA) viral load measured respiratory, stool, serum, urine samples. Cycle threshold values, measure nucleic acid concentration, plotted onto standard curve constructed basis standard product. Epidemiological, clinical, laboratory characteristics treatment outcomes data obtained data collection forms electronic medical records, relation clinical data disease severity analysed.

Results 3497 respiratory, stool, serum, urine samples collected patients admission evaluated SARS-CoV-2 RNA viral load. Infection confirmed patients testing sputum saliva samples. RNA detected stool 55 (59%) patients serum 39 (41%) patients. urine sample one patient positive SARS-CoV-2. median duration virus stool (22 days, interquartile range 17-31 days) significantly longer respiratory (18 days, 13-29 days; P=0.02) serum samples (16 days, 11-21 days; P&lt;0.001). median duration virus respiratory samples patients severe disease (21 days, 14-30 days) significantly longer patients mild disease (14 days, 10-21 days; P=0.04). mild group, viral loads peaked respiratory samples second week disease onset, whereas viral load continued high third week severe group. Virus duration longer patients older 60 years male patients.

Conclusion duration SARS-CoV-2 significantly longer stool samples respiratory serum samples, highlighting need strengthen management stool samples prevention control epidemic, virus persists longer higher load peaks later respiratory tissue patients severe disease. Ethiopian 114 year old birth certificate guy probably 85 tops. Disneyland Disney World even started search come Asia last 100 years. China rapidly surpassing us patent applications publications.

American exceptionalism! think we're ones innovating n STEM; therefore must be! Yeah people social animals wont buck trend long. wear mask others follow everything else. fear many plant moved unionize. job without union better one without.

People love talk Toyotas Hondas built US, non union shops constantly threaten employees leave unionize. Hahaha, can't laugh poor sense humour. I'm Canadian also, relax. Wrong again, know many successful people wrong. There's chance would say face. Notrumpotomus rename Tesla Edison. Except average number deaths given year spiked Covid19 took hold U.S. spike well reported Covid19 cases added in. traffic fatalities dropping people stayed home 2 months.


So no, normal death rates let's call Covid19 reason. Read ot figure wtf ""ketchup effect"" is. Apparently context means rapid increase, like ketchup comes once. Mystery solved. *except police unions. economy back more. hidden agenda? seeing answer ranting bullshit.

Woman gets fired falsifying records..woman makes dashboard real numbers. talking Danish friend mine day. ""spandex"" bike trail heard passing paceline discussing pizza gonna eat afterwards. Danish. 

Danes LOVE live life. love eat, drink, smoke (ok less smoke before, there's still lot), sex, party, live. bite ass end life, though, yeah. 

So maybe part it, def whole story. dunno I'm middle age imagine aliens look us look younger generation - yeah they're bit weird kinda scary sometimes, super cringy bizarrely self-destructive really they're nothing new, every bit dumb maybe even moreso... Aliens looking us fond regret remembering simple things biggest fears deadly pandemics, state violence, cataclysmic climate collapse... Hahaha, can't laugh poor sense humour. I'm Canadian also, relax. Even though willfully ignorant, still feel bad family. shitty time I'd hate wonder stupidity killed grandma. wrong premise flawed. trying reframe weird metric nobody cares about. walk grandma's nursing home day would died anyway blow brains front you, say ""meh, one life-day""?

Normal people care number lives. many people dead be. start doing, assigning value one life another, really fucking slippery slope. That's people like. always believe Fauci. refuses give ill guidance president back lies. I’m honestly surprised he’s still White House. feel bad him, it’s gotta like walking tightrope. conference call yesterday someone said don’t know masks effective... excited local mall would opening soon.

No, really thing. tracker posted sub [just 14 days short time amount vaccines process grown exponentially stages. currently 3 vaccines Phase III trials. want tesla anymore things keeps doing. countries implemented hard early lockdowns didn't. look countries hit hardest lacked decisive action start pandemic blindsided, applied countries like China Italy simply already hit people really know going on. 

And demonstrations get virus control, kind lockdowns hard population. the? Idiots Canada? 


I thought idiots purely American phenomenon. Sorry. ""We would committing felony wore motorcycle helmet August 1st"".

Since saying exemptions end August 1st, helmets halloween masks would also felonies. They're listed healthcare masks well. countries lockdown problem tourism industri? Yes like Croatia! (new spike cases opening tourists) always called.*physical distance*. course, people understand means, can't arsed. get unemployment top that? I'm states federal bonus netting $900/week. country's refusal admit make mistakes going destroy us.

On bright side, one less country unwilling admit makes mistakes! highest recorded daily cases yesterday since outbreak started. assume people possess semblance empathy. People dumb. Every story like quotes attendees rhymes social distancing along pictures showing right next other. Kudos relatives didn’t attend. ::the ford pinto entered chat:: yeah worked union. 

Im union hell, co workers absolute bare minimum even less impossible fire ANYTHING! Co workers allowed 15 call offs ever getting fired 90 days previous call offs erased employees abuse call policy non stop. New contracts equal less hourly pay, vacation time, personal time previous contract(s). New loop holes jump qualify health insurance. keep going! 
Im sure strong unions exist majority useless anymore. I've updating consistently. articles late June. commentary refers ‘Circulating plasma concentrations angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 men women heart failure effects renin–angiotensin–aldosterone inhibitors’, I.E. Sama et al., 2020;41:1810–1817.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) resulting disease termed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) shows fatality rate greater men compared women.1 explain this, hypotheses raised, genes regulate immune system encoded X chromosome smoking behaviour,2 expression levels1 variants angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), receptor SARS-CoV-2.3

However, would like point ACE2 gene located X chromosome (location: Xp22.2; nucleotides 15 494 402–15 602 148, GRCh38.hg38 version). knowledge, importance ACE2 localization X chromosome explored previously. Often, two copies ameliorates deleterious effects X-linked diseases and, consequence, X-linked syndromes produce male diseases. Uh-huh. I'm done juiced projections.

Yes, help. entire nations crushed Covid curve without widespread use masks.

I've idea American obsession culture war, point. need shut hell up. fit entire covid19 genome floppy disk.

The greatest computer ever made still inferior human brain.

And floppy disk kicking super computer's ass... lots Covid protest action there, news doesnt show Get ahead now, could municipal water supplies bidding 2201 Q2. Bwahahahaha!

Instead killing population communicable disease starvation. fucking feed them... oh wait, profit margins, bad Radioactive mutant looting zombies super speed flying power. 2020 all. guess redditors used free press find strange, post every negative article find. nice Branch Elonians strange breed. looking like Florida going worse Italy own.

Where antibody news, new simple tests? already know appears.. Yes protestors good reason tell Corona. 

“Hey, Corona? need thousands people gather cities around US protest could please infect us? Thanks.” 

There’s good chunk people don’t wear masks correctly (or nothing all) day-to-day basis I’m sure protests. It’s likely Corona cases spiked time. guess 60,000-person protest wasn’t good idea. commentary refers ‘ACE2 X chromosome: could explain COVID-19 gender differences?’, E. Culebras F. Hernández, doi:10.1093/eurheartj/ehaa521.

The apparent superiority women men succumbing COVID-19 completely understood. Therefore, examination sex-distinguishing genetics angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), host receptor binds SARS coronaviruses, might help explain sex disparity.

The ACE2 gene located X chromosome expressed various tissues, including heart, kidneys, testes.1 Endogenous soluble ACE2 (found circulation) shed cell membrane-bound form enzyme responsible shedding ADAM17,2,3 also membrane anchored. recently postulated co-expression ACE2 ADAM17 testes (Supplementary figures 5 6 Sama et al.4) might partially explain plasma ACE2 concentrations higher men women.4

We agree commentary Culebras Hernández5 mere occurrence ACE2 X chromosome could also important explaining men would suffer ACE2-related diseases women. general, based gene dosage, men suffer often X-linked disease traits women.6

Ninja: Updated year 2017 2019 industry/company unionize? federal government offer protection citizens? Yep. saddest thing COVID China damn dysfunctional could nipped bud there. failing governments ALSO dysfunctional, could stopped regions. 

Some places successfully suppressed / eradicated virus. clear done. competancy lacking. Europe figured tbh, except Sweden degree Portugal Poland. quick glance figures report ECDC illuminating: live one harder hit states don’t know anyone died. Neither 2/3 NYC residents iirc. people know infected fine weeks. think virus falls unfortunate sweet spot lethal enough wrack large death toll, severe enough personally impact everyone. Who’s incredibly fraudulent brand future technology making world better place reality Musk trust fund colonialist anything daddy gifted literal gem mine. don’t get pretend savior base marketing type things business done. Last heard, want american walking bio-bombs there. Super Walmart Hawthorn pretty big, don’t think fit million people there... ..cases spiking cities large protest. Cities slowly rising pace riots. counties everyone must wear mask counties stay home orders. also lying number dead virus. Misattributed deaths things pneumonia lung related deaths strangely increased 5x counted total anyone brain could see could relationship. surprised around range already. Obviously don’t rely sick/vacation time. Sick time exist. you’re sick, you’re sick.

If it’s longer X weeks (serious illness) kind insurance starts paying, isn’t employer. guess we'll take one one. 

Your first link joke. Half things inventions made United States foreigners. leave home countries able achieve innovations.

The second focuses blue sky type scientific research. There're doubt talented scientists researchers around world. fact scientific achievements translate consumer/commercial/industrial innovations frequently countries US proves point.

The last makes mistake global rankings do. us homogeneous place. much clearer picture would painted breaking us compononent states, Europe broken component states. Youd find dozen us states top list, others farther down. alternatively, could compare united states whole European union whole. find us well above. comparing us whole european state individually apples oranges. think league creates one paraplegic person per year - it’s going take lot. age health risk playing football probably way higher risk coronavirus. don’t see strong evidence would suggest masks alome stop pandemic dead track. Maybe could get everyone medical grade masks somehow made everyone wear times, realistic. 

What know lockdowns tracing numbers low working keep check. isn’t pleasant solution countries like US social safety net control spread Yep, exactly going happen husband too. ❤️ sorry you’re going that. Can’t believe families don’t empathy realize it’s them, wow, it’s hard new parent circumstances. Beautiful country dude. Moved UK 15 yrs ago would never go back. teenage son wants move Canada eventually. let guess... **600.000** people? **SOFT** lockdown? Yes, compare today 33 days ago.

Source? millions dying every year pre-existing conditions, routine deaths nobody ever cared much about, suddenly need super obsessed every Covid death, applied everyone costs, except course impoverished mobs rioters looters taken streets since. Police unions fine imo, complemented professional regulatory colleges strict legislation. Wow! first article I’ve seen Sweden didn’t make Sweden. I’ve trying get tested- can’t get in. CVS, Walgreens booked up. Urgent care answering phone. Broward year site requiring prescription, televisions available. honestly don’t know it’s allergies corona, never eyes get conjunctivitis typical allergies... hopefull, it’s Saharan dust stor. haven’t seen numbers riots yet. San Antonio didn’t big protests it’s getting bad “Care for,” understand! got sick wouldn’t expect neighbor come take care me. “Care about”..I guess thought people might consider wearing thin piece fabric face don’t kill someone’s family member, cause lose child. Apparently not. 

I wish families even “cared about” baby’s safety. They’re guilt-tripping us pandemic anything, like we’ll keeping grandchild reason. 

Ugh. really hope things get better. Sounds like maybe you’re state done okay job far. ❤️ Best luck you! Yeah I'm allowed go appointments either need lockdown strick rules, Virginia strong ""suggestion"" people wear masks. Shaken stirred.


Hmm....gee masks social distance. get covid? envy you. wife shoved back office next week co-workers exact attitude. 

The defense come high masks absolutely mandatory. co-workers already calling “mask police.” 

I’m thinking making little sticker wear Monday: “Hello, name is: Mask Police.” May well it... said she’s fine playing hall monitor child-like adults. Thank you. Made day. spread word


Could used different group words sadly people refusing mask spreading covid, catching covid. Well wife teacher seemed think good question, whatever. Yes agree Italy done lot good things. I’m small comune Umbria I’m impressed serious well organized mayor been. Relieved, actually, rather home country Scotland. yes reopening businesses general attitude Italy definitely cautious countries see. Eg. UK, USA... Yeah, seems way. Wait vaccine, hope pray next years thing time mutates something less deadly. 

Sad times... Smear infections less 10% infections. Scientists said it’s super unlikely, someone pretty much coughed hand touched right coughed it.

It’s completely overkill means know yet. (Trying get herd immunity infecting almost everyone completely insane evil idea beginning though.) ^ here's true patriot. Police unions actually highly effective protecting members. Unfortunately that's detriment quality policing sometimes. Lol username checks ya show great USA done understand many I've met actively despise children I'm worried many actually change mind later hear Kiersten, GED Skinny Coffee “Business,” starts spouting studies don’t meet rigorous scientific standards starts posting unsourced factually incorrect don’t get sweet high self satisfied smugness whenever admit could wrong instead purposely going grain feel unique contrarian. different article states 25 scientist behind Sweden’s controversial Covid-19 strategy said he’s willing reconsider using face masks, previously seeing little benefit them.  Tegnell, Sweden’s state epidemiologist architect hands-off response coronavirus pandemic, said situations might advisable people cover mouths noses.  masks “possibly” recommended people using public transport, Tegnell said interview Dagens Industri Thursday. “We need think more.” masks “definitely won’t become optimal solution way,” said.  far argued [World Health recommendation use face masks social distancing hard do, justification there’s “very little scientific evidence” work. Instead, Tegnell warned masks may give infected people false sense security even encourage kind hand-to-face contact spread disease.  updated stance masks earlier month, encouraging people wear social distancing isn’t option.  Swedish Way  Swedish epidemiologist repeatedly made international headlines since advising full lockdown. He’s subsequently admitted restrictions might necessary, refused abandon strategy. Meanwhile, Sweden one world’s highest Covid mortality rates.  Wednesday, Tegnell spoke severe lockdowns appropriate response virus. podcast Swedish radio, said felt “[world gone imposing severe restrictions, despite societal costs.  shuttering schools, shops restaurants, Sweden left pretty much everything open. Citizens encouraged observe social distancing guidelines, strategy assumed Swedes would voluntarily alter behavior without need laws.  comments Dagens Industri, Tegnell said Swedes continue observe social distancing guidelines, working home possible, avoiding public transport.  think keep living little differently good while,” said. MILLIONS walking around without masks stores worry you? mind!!!!!! read sub .....Houston hospitals 97 %full 
Dallas 79 ...its Texas experiencing this. Cases spiking every larger big riot city true China seeing LOT 2nd time patients now? gamble part try ensure PPE supply line essential medical personnel remained flowing people needed most.

It based idea honest important masks are, even ask people give priority hospital staff, still millions people freaking buying stuff time enough available.

Unfortunately, side effect plan effective made people distrust masks entirely. danes eat wrong type food drink much alcohol

Never said fact illustrated food thing via paceline anecdote. 

Danes' life expectancy lower catastrophically lower seem implying. 

Yes, culture around bad food choices, much drinking much smoking needs change that's pretty topic sub tbh. Working Odessa Texas week. one wearing mask anywhere. guy work lives Houston said ICU beds 91% said hoax it’s liberals trying get people hate trump.... Burnnnnnnnnn crying loud. stupid birthday party. 

My birthday April. sister cake delivered watched movie. Actually don’t remember much middle “safer home” suggestion didn’t feel like celebrating. Don’t care. Didn’t matter. relatives still fine, better present. 

We extra special celebration holidays birthdays didn’t get over. mother like (not young, still). went visit grandpa stayed outside... sitting next bench. reasons outside magically protect germs guess? (She goes friends lot.) understand moronic reasoning process. dropped present Mother's Day, stayed distance away front yard wore mask, acted like crazy, catching anyway. Sticking Zoom praying since that's do. fine time coworkers lazy, work falls employees thus creating work. I’m job job someone else keeps calling penalized it, I’d fucking pissed too. **""Those waiting lifesaving MRI scans detect tumours increased 5,733 78,932""** I've trained cat army pee command.

Really strange stuff starting assume Chinese Russian paid professional trolls. matter, politician solely running platform, there's many issues running on, union giving money supposed used negotiations employer politician disagree want support. individuals union want donate money votes, that's freedom to, donating money without permission, union taking away freedom support candidate choosing. also recommend bidet? F it. I'll buy one government didn’t listen lot folks COVID. 

One thing thats consistent lack strong federal leadership regarding virus. one reason worried contact tracing apps. knew could, would, exploited eventually. Either malicious spoofs would appear genuine apps would hacked. Honestly still don’t data previously infected people getting sick assume scenario. Sounds like great news, might explain people seem getting sick groceries stuff buy. Sweden still [one highest death rates per capital rolling 7 day forecast deaths increase again. I've seen inefficiency. think depends union, leadership, even industry. I'd rather strengthen national laws workers stop increasing gross divide rich. problem big universal unions solve imo. Yall fail realize many unions corrupt like plice union. small amount, many messed up. system created people shit accountability generally corrupt. Really need unions proper reps accountability. simplest terms, work type entertainment venue. Since reopening, policy something along lines 'when public present, masks strongly recommended employees.' think everyone adhering policy. open, close anyone office area public floor, masks everyone. Apparently part 'public' work there. Sigh. Go back headlines lapdog. would catastrophic horrible. Apparently [popped face mask exempt card. covid spiking $600 stimulus checks top unemployment actually made poorest making way money back jobs.

As countries like Spain Italy show, things still live long. It´s danes eat wrong type food drink much alcohol. Maybe invest time researching danes stop dying early compeared nordic neighbours? Since you´re concerned swedish people dying soon, must even concerned danes dying even sooner, right? think arching point that, despite exceptionally fatal, Coronovirus bad news. Economically health wise.

Masks get us faster less harm, people still screeching like total dimwits (or trolls). 

Its mask, forever. Get wear one public.

I hope start fining people dont wear one public September 2nd wave going really bad. Reverse racism. newly afflicted flings going on? Send LA, FL AL. Best!

I thought going undo button two blouse think strange see fat old guys talking smack. virus sees bacon. coronaviruses. pretty well studied.  consensus Philly marathon (11/22) get cancelled well? I’m gonna bummed get 20 mile weeks cancel it!  Bold words pandemic. 

Lol... god news greatest comment time  Polls useless merica Holy fucking shit can't believe many people country fucking stupid. I’m Arizona. 

The rest correct though. forget globe-denier. EU speak can't Trump stop funding it. feel like I'm gaslight everyone lol. People afraid make mistakes, ""other"" side take mistake bury them. Instead healthy response would help out, learn let best choice rise teamwork. If? post like 2 days ago saying cases spiked hard new record cases deaths single day? already happened NY/NJ/CT coordinating start. closely interlinked states. Many NJ CT residents work NY, NY residents come NJ CT work. way get COVID control without states taking seriously. (And south Jersey needed collaboration PA DE, also happened.)

There's reason tri-state area act differently now. three states got COVID spread control, continue cooperate keep way. taunting front children, adults bullying children too? like why? Yea, instant 100% lockdown means hospitalizations keep going 5-10 days. What’s scary 4th holiday coming that’ll likely increase social contact lot. Parks Rec isn’t funny it’s real life.  2420 actually decent sample size, I’d like see similar polls question comparison. nothing stating governments force people wear anything.

Then means, don’t wear mask. poisoning country contagion ignorance, pls don’t wear one. doesn’t California claimed 7k cases? WorldoMeter reports 5k already 39k. holds true, that’s 42k cases day People selfish ultimately destroy themselves. human race doomed. TBH, warp speed ability, might sign up. Idk took comment shitting LA, didn’t say bad thing. live LA would much rather live 3 cities mentioned it’s less dense. Yeah should’ve listened president....oh wait... never mind. Lockdowns don’t shit except delay herd immunity Lockdowns ended protests started  2nd wave 1st one never fucking stopped accurately, 65% Americans willing respond survey. look MN see isn’t true. Cases decline weeks MN since protests. Yes. 5 entire countries reported 6000+ cases today (Mexico, Russia, India, Brazil, US)

Could get even worse though? Oh yes. Same. It’s making question life choices life seems pretty sad based 3 sentence description likes stay home go gym? Well took home page, guess Coronavirus according reddit. correct way present would say cases growing almost fast cases NJ NY 7 weeks.

jesus. 7 weeks ago. deadly account nearly half million deaths?

Just kills low percentage people catch it, mean deadly. incredibly contagious spreads like wildfire. issue. lot death tolls cases 3-4 weeks ago cases spiking. still 19-20k day we've reaching 35-38k climbing day day. said fact healthcare systems getting better better treating virus probably main reasons death tolls lower rn. comes heat true help much see southern states getting spikes countries like India Brazil getting increased amounts covid cases despite heat. You’re comparing mask use countries peaked 2 months ago declined ever since mask use country might set daily case record today? That’s effective argument application debate team rejected. Oi! got link that? here. It’s +60 crowd political leanings. mental european, government mandatory masks rule 5 days declared pandemic. country mostly reopened (we get 30-50 cases day) don’t wear mask outside still enter business public transportation. would say 30% people wear masks times, inside malls whatnot everyone haven’t seen anyone throw hissy fit it. Idk america everything political painful. say shitblaster. Thanks getting involved. really saved day. No. research target conspiracy theory origin new coronavirus. 
The research worked understand risk bat coronaviruses jumping humans causing devastating disease. Scientists speculated politics conspiracy theory played role canceling funding research, good scientific standing seen critical work. grant, titled “Understanding risk bat coronavirus emergence,” originally funded NIH 2014 renewed another five years 2019 receiving outstanding peer-review score. government putting responsibility keeping people safe individual. messaging clear concise beginning thus people got choose side speak.  seems handled: participate reopened businesses choose. wear mask nothing enforced. work choose (whether financially viable problem). get sick that's financial burden. people taking precautions public that's get everyone comply recommendations (stay home, social distance MASKS) social pressure. true. country needs leadership. Trump stood pleaded case masks may helpful, base may actually listen care thinks make look week. dear lord baby jesus invented masks reason. Jesus Christ mate shut fuck up. Ignorant morons like reason rest planet thinks country laughing stock. fucking hard put mask ensure safety yourself, safety around you? Stop acting like it’s political statement wear mask not, it’s preventative measure public health crisis fucking idiots like reason US handled pandemic catastrophically.

I understand saying now. Completely agree. testing soon people get plane. Hell, even day one, surprised initially. Mandatory tests border soon get plane, put quarantine facility released 14 days negative test result. one other, both. lot us follow say parents take gospel. knew announced - steroids lead bad outcomes early cases. Months ago. antibodies shown start declining within months. There’s substantial indication herd immunity exists this, simply it’s 6 months hasn’t enough time pass see well bodies maintain level immunity. best response people say that:

Also, insults eh...who calling OP jackass, hmmmm....  Everyone Alamo died. Wow, Great... Fuck thought process! Hopefully, parents fuck uncle get shit Fox pundit. already late, need hear moving forward. I've working it, need shit wake up. Hopefully, fuck-nuckle start. Shut ass-smug-face. environmentally travesty. he’s acted corona gassing protestors, would considered voting him. least maybe vote all. since two things I’ve gone “he’s idiot harmful” lecturing friends family cannot office more. I’ll voting Biden much don’t want either Also forget hurricane season inevitably large swaths folks emergency travel counties/states get path. we've also got going us, nice. Mistake #1...your reading fox news liked ted Cruz besides boring tone smirks debates. He’s really well spoken. 8.9% state, seems like better odds winning profit scratcher  able send photo makes sense. always seemed weird mail passport photo (and take problem long follow photo guidelines), DMV wants butt person.

Some people like extreme heat. idea why. Yes. demonstrates *can* prop economy somewhat cash transfers, may good data *social* impacts, enough get model UBI healthy economy. Less money moving economy, CARES really flimsy stick propping right now.

I've seen articles go ""We inflation now, UBI could work!"" missed reason cash transfers: make *decreased* income, rather bolster stable meager income. would argue job enact people.

James Madison discusses Federalist No. 57. Basically yes elected officials intended educated basis decisions meant made priority first foremost reelection makes fundamentally beholden constituents, tenet strong democracy.

But counter argument oftentimes populace doesn’t really know best less educated knowledgeable many issues public officials would be.

There balance struck feeling anybody says public officials saying screw constituents quickly change tune don’t agree public officials doing. Many models three months ago also predicted (even lockdowns) order magnitude deaths actually occurred though, hard generalize. true especially elementary level. people also think it’s classrooms worry about. Hallways, buses already crammed three kids seat routes, cafeteria, playground. little bit digging. Drownings higher lower middle income nations. fewer barriers dangerous areas (e.g. guardrail) fewer people receive swimming instruction. Two children drowned latrines South Africa since 2014. unsafe situations poorer countries. Also, floods account drownings. laughable. Protests absolutely contributed infections significant way. People shoulder shoulder, yelling, without masks. virus instantly die outside. still catch outdoors. Suuuuuure. That's reason. players. coaches, trainers, staff, stadium staff, tv production staff...either quarantined tested every game, every week, mention practices. 

Absurd think positive test happen, bring season. fair NJ quarantine order likely unconstitutional Including herd immunity.  Sounds like herd immunity may horizon.

Are actually serious satire post?   concern fellow man indeed touching. Angela Merkel calls too? Damn, that’s gotta sting! Gold lining? Herd immunity. exactly you’re highly recommend this. Airflow key. Distance duration too. job sounds risky me. watched cable ""news"" channel country they're properly informing viewship. anything they're helping propagate anti-mask sentiment. hear? went zero cases like president said would It’s mind blowing dense people ..I Pittsburgh county us seeing increases health department wants us wear masks people Facebook still saying it’s like flu masks don’t help won’t wear one.. it’s body choice. don’t even know say people. talked family? friend says doesn’t matter it’s old people die, true story. Fucking preach. It’s hard everyone wore one could lot faster. see that, sonsabitches?! dumb made MARCO RUBIO look like smart one comparison...

Wear masks. They're like $10 million goddamn hobos... one ever said would “beat it.” Flatten curve. Herd immunity. Enough ventilators (which ended used NY). Wish granted, tiny tiny piece arriving place soon hung 2 best friends wives times. 4 people last 3.5 months. continue ~~morale~~ numbers improve. talked best friend float nurse Houston. hospital working today 12 ICU beds 22 ICU patients moment.

Nothing done slow CA. onion article??? would anyone think pandemic over? never made real progress, 2-3 weeks partial reopening put us right back months ago March, like science said would happen. wrong. actually Jake Paul's fault. Covid surprisingly easy kill/disinfect. Even Windex kill within 5 mins. Probably 00090 million.  idea cases going up? Obvious thing would protests, said it? Going back work? Well generalize 35% population completely disconnected idiots certainly least percentage working government. Hell, look em bat shit craziies... two problems sampling. One must sample number people represent average population people come hospital show symptoms.

The thing test itself. tests diseases took years develop became reliable, case Corona tests used error rate 100%. tests got reliable time still far away reliable. state? Next mass graves. try finding nice/hidden walking trails around area friend. put mask see people trail. bad? older get, prefer dogs. even joking. Nope. exactly science told us would happen started reopening everything willy nilly without actually anything contain virus. limited 50 people per 4-mile radius.

If people using masks, less likely spew Covid everything cough, sneeze, breathe.

So fewer places actually need disenfected, risk missing spot needed cleaning drops.

So others wearing masks, people disenfecting surfaces decrease odds touching Covid.


Then there's washing hands, using sanitizer hands.

Then there's touching face.


But odds hands fingers Covid19 lowered none first steps taken.


It's like teaching kid take shower. Sure run around without drying off, bathroom get wet. still better keep shower curtain closed bathroom dosent get sprayed down. Thank you, genuinely appreciate that. Best also. Unpossible?

Selfish assholes, electing selfishness assholes. Simple effective messaging. “You mad, cow?” Fear mongering finest Genuine question: aren’t Americans pissed Jerome Adams initially told wear masks???

I don’t hear enough people talking that. Probably severely embarrassed government is. Also keep mind small percentage country exposed far, like 5-7 percent. still long way go, people spread across big country, w/ huge variance precautions taken. gonna w us awhile, need testing/tracing system let people get back towards normal. Big Jim Justice would well contracted coronavirus. Guys, bigger Texas. Everyone knows this. realize European countries residents wear masks, right? See: Croatia, Denmark, Netherlands, etc problem need cooperate us minimize severity situation. Even small fucktard population spread virus easily Sadly.  lot people would still alive we’d responsible administration charge.

No much irresponsible right malicious. Saying irresponsible makes sounds like accident. claim ignorance get it. No, acted decisively preparing golden parachutes finally bring entire country knees. trump nothing enriching ""friends"" let without challenging it.

The people coming part cabinet/team dont get golden parachute pissed it. dozen measures 1 2 ignore. posted day ago local paper cited ACLU groups behind exemption, stating something POC masks yet another negative profiling mechanism. 

I floored. everyone’s masks POC targets masks? It’s mask everyone’s using them. It’s still thing. 

But exemptions? trying prevent (perception connotation mask wearing POCs) new easier mechanism racism. Look people aren’t wearing them. 

Jesus Christ! world literally gone mad. That’s means. And... boom! pandemic? ended. Everything’s fine now. 🤪 link antibody percentage? believe big part reason bailouts made transparently protect panic. They'd rather people angry presuming went companies totally need that's scenario actually promotes confidence narrative companies economy whole mostly resilient. real responsible accounting publicly shared may clearly outline issue as: many, many companies -- continue -- danger either closing good file bankruptcy restructure immense amounts corporate debt receive bailout funds exorbitant amounts. one dropped factoid really care.

The number people laid tens millions number people died COVID hundreds thousands. need genius peer reviewed source guess much likely know someone laid someone died unless goal pedantic asshole shit like ""YOU X% LIKELY KNOW DURRRRRRRRR"". contentious.

You're probably asking source flex.  Every tracker slices day slightly differently, ends different depending times zones states reported. April many reporting multiple times day. 

So it’s almost certainly least tie. 8:22 EST US 109 cases away hitting time high according worldometer

Edit: 8:23, 75 estimated kill 1-4 million actually. yea covid much worse cause litterly destroyed economy it. major lockdowns countries even still death toll managed get nearly half million within 6 months. death tolls go 3k average day (it's higher 3k ever since end march) would easily still surpass 1 million end year well considering many countries underreporting now... someone who's unemployment New York state was... really easy? Logged on, filled questionnaire 20 questions, every monday wake fill another 5 questions (which little annoying, less annoying finding looking work.)

I thought sounded familiar, sorry digging history know - hello fellow narcoleptic! makes part problem. baby due early October time conception wouldn’t imagined would situation. Even harder believe could still could handled much better nobody seems care. Well, Fauci said March people didn’t need wear masks. Get ready lawsuits headline sounds like came straight Plague, Inc. !RemindMe October 1st Fuck I'm normal thinking liberal. least Germany point US say prevented far. friend said old people die, it’s right act like doesn’t exist. She’s definitely Fox News gal. Hold on, king. back stronger ever Yeah. estimate 6 months. prepped month first time haven’t nervous whole thing since start (and started reading December). nervous. Wait I’m loop, didn’t corona quarantine 14 days never get it? misconception? Husband supposed try January decided wait May. Obviously May smack dab middle coronavirus decided push August thinking shit would start turning around. Looks like August could potentially worse ever. live Florida I'm 33, clock ticking really want family, damn, really puts off. Sorry. trying say fat people dumb. I'm saying feels weird see act invulnerable likely co-morbidities. means Trump would admit he's wrong. won't. That’s Reddit become cesspool low thinking liberals. He's dumb realize this. He's toddler pulling levers make stuff happen. there? I'm seeing give seal approval. We're taking things hands. state government suceeded federal gov hasn't. Also, Florida imposed quarantine order anyone NYC tri-state area. We're playing fair, return, imposing own. 

Also, want know countries successfully cutting imported virus transmissions? Quarantine hotel, tracking app contact tracing. banned fast food home poor experience Wendy’s Stockton Ave Doubt it. Everyone know pay cut, reduced hours reduced business. pay cut 20% wife hours cut half. brother works sales commissions making 20% normal. different industries locations. mean, tbf, we've getting told months going happen. saw Italy shrugged, saw NYC shrugged. nation "" can't happen me"" turn nation ""Holy shit thing real hoax, please take seriously.""

And honestly think people grasp real hard fact way past point return. Im sorry TX/AZ/FL going ""getting handle"" things now. told us one shot half country scoffed &amp; said party want, get sick. told us stay lock down, opened country going fail stock market going crash Texas leaders saying people prepared sacrifice life dollar suppose ""CDC guidelines follow"" anyone whi ever worked restaurant knew werekt going followed. experts telling us wear mask fighting muh rights muh freedoms wear one. 

At point think anything short extreme lockdown, mandatory face mask (and mean like zero fucking exceptions) even remotely slow thing there's Way Hell go back lockdown again, without outrage across country. look forward 40 million unemployed LOT people job going start getting evicted soon. try close again, states can't afford keep demand unemployment, means people job place live societal safety nets place. accepted fucked point. It'd probably helped people started accepting preparing best can.

This result incompetent science denying leaders place dont give fuck you. mean ""return lockdown?"" can’t enforce law, resign. 
 
Or STFU job. remember there's twitter thot licking toilet bowl airplane prove coronavirus lethal ?

i fear stupidity already spread around US. tell us. Surgeon General tweeted caps ""STOP BUYING MASKS"" various 'experts' least officials parroted masks somehow making things worse. 

This simply government failing- actively killing people via lies. I've never even considered quarantine days point. go sew blackout curtains use properly every single night. enforced people flaunt order. Look lack social distancing mask wearing bars restaurants around state. Smart medically, stupid politically. Presumably scientific basis claim? Outside Trump rally Tulsa, guy holding 6-month old baby crowd. Neither baby wore kind masks. that’s reckless endangerment baby. can’t imagine someone would infant. Idk man, Lindsay unpopular people *really* hate Mitch McConnell. think Lindsay subreddits devoted removing office, Mitch does. that's functioning democracy looks like. Huh. May quartz you. literally unhealthy society Earth tax payer funded privately owned football stadiums. officially declared unconstitutional years ago Ever heard constitution? times like really hate governor. set Trump dick joke debate, rest history still flu. 

--Facebook news even constitutional? stopped last night. least ones weren’t prepped for. probably worked rest today. Mac DeMarco figure this? Basically, one wing wears masks, doesn't. wing wears masks wing protesting. Masks work well actually made reopener squad sort right (don't need stringent lockdowns everyone masks up) real goal pretend virus gone made one wing (coincidentally wing wear masks) look bad It’s conservative talking point. attacking rest scientific community. Washington done amazing considering popped cherry. (Thanks Carl Bergstrom grade epidemiology there!) 

Alaska done great recently- hopefully tamp things back down. 

Hawaii done bang job even advantages.

Utah surprisingly aggressive Kansas. 

All said none done great all, even best, fail &lt;10 deaths per million threshold competent pandemic response. 

Obviously none states mentioned high pop density- reason- US whole truly failed anywhere highly susceptible burned. [Freedom movement, like time people put mine barbed wire Um. assuming am. species abandoned basic survival instincts. believe, fucking horseshit science become common sense, people expected follow common sense.

but since alot people lack common sense ............ Like going believe word Big Government neocon say us all. rethinking climate change, we've forgotten right now. Yes, China 10:1 batch testing Wuhan, positive rate near ZERO - 200 10 million! I’m confused California, New Yorker, early March/April got scolded saying done shelter place faster, like California, CA infections much lower NY. NY great turnaround California creeping up? feel like lot noise numbers, it’s mask usage testing capacity. There’s something going don’t know yet. Trump thought going big deal COVID blown way proportion.

Then hit bad, worse, people said going Trump can't back admit made mistake because, mind, makes look weak. he's doubling down.

That's right: hundred thousand Americans dead Trump's ego. US govt stay home orders. FLu kiLLs pEOPlE! Yea, bf’s family invites people dinner drink every day throw family party every week so. couldn’t afford surgical masks go beach often without masks. bf EVERYTHING convince family, think virus fake lmao. also contagious... come too, don’t afraid come covid. open non residents right now. don’t problems Americans, us understands president doesn’t represent majority. statement framed give people another excuse disregard increases COVID numbers. people going spend time understand ""nuances"" reporting, would surprised reliable information even exists considering unstable response been.  started last night. Trying tell family friends different shutdown. controlled pressing brakes. engine brick going 60mph. 

The virus doesn’t shut things depending whether essential not. people friends family sick dying hospital, going quit going work. hospitals don’t room injuries, people stop dangerous jobs. $2 raise isn’t going stop it. Except lot people following rules itching get *spend money recreation* save live frugally focus health family neighbours. No. think it’s little late point, unless maybe Biden wins see something takes office. point it’s political people suffer. Houston, problem. need list terms use properly. 

Cognitive Dissonance, Virtue Signaling, etc. Someone needs make infograph lazy ass. Yeah can't cough someone give obesity. leaders always say greatest richest powerful country world. think see infection rate contest can’t fall behind in. Guess Science hard comprehend Look stats. pandemic. get votes yet? Checking friend feels like I'm taking crazy pills. arguments family friends time saying ""it's okay. restaurants everything back open go sit close anyone""

I'm loss want give trying educate family. Stay realistic. agree him. Edit : I'm dumb ideas, first two tried worked me, last one came now:

No knock dead drop like drug deal spy movie. (This resulted special text letting know eagle landed!)

No knock leave porch puppy / daughter / whoever loves magic burrito fairy

No knock wife ovulating ;)

Try report back! Trump talks people way adult talks child. much travel Europe states February March? densely populated states? PCR tests available March? available now? PPE?

We equipped handle COVID state March. mass introductions virus via European travel, virus spread essentially testing. June, there's excuse. live Savannah, Georgia. flooded tourists since restrictions lifted late April. past 7 days 11 restaurants shut due Covid positive employees, hospitalizations increasing day.  there’s way they’ll go back another lockdown. Even do, general public won’t care. terrible situation across south. Amazingly it’s almost half over...I can’t believe it’s July already. Ughhh rate Halloween gonna cancelled Reddit- Black lives matter!

(Virus disproportionately kills African Americans spreads exponentially)

Reddit- Black lives longer matter! There's round 2? survey 2,420 adults represents 340 million Americans??

Lol Funny doubt Vietnam's case came China, actively doubting whether Japan's case came Taiwan. Japanese tested **positive** right left Taiwan. Vietnamese tested **negative** left China. That's Olympic level mental gymnastic right forgot timer resets, isnt like 930 est 10? Still wayyyyyyy weeks ago. Yup. Government needs keep us safe protect us economic fallout. shouldn’t choose. I’m getting downvoted hard could open Disney ICU ward onsite. Disney Mortuary. Think marketing possibilities. [Except '19' means reliable source science academia wikipedia Every downtown core every city tons restaurants serve office workers. lot family-run businesses. make 90 percent revenue lunch rush 11 1 pm. lunch rush. don’t know survive. Oh wow, hard data. 10k 330 million people study done 2 months ago liberal website. Yeah people older support money many houses paid mostly paid off. us supporting families cannot afford another shutdown. first one drained savings unless pay bills literally can't afford shutdown. need study it. need test.

Good news! can't even talk 70 year old mother anymore refuses wear mask. give shit dies death culty level evangelical give shit infecting people narcissist. pro-Trump kind shitty came around. think drew kinds people woodwork identify flaws. 60k deaths July, Aug sep? seems pretty low given rapidly spreading right now. would wonderful 20k month lower, really doubt it. grandmother wheels, would bike! Canada - Alberta Well tomorrow Friday. day two prediction 6k day point think need help outside world. We’ve saved free world couple times - someone lend us hand?

Ban flights USA, stop buying American products administration changes. level infection treat us like apartheid South Africa. Help us Bono - hope!!! friend filed unemployment sometime Arpil got funds last week. 

It took month get mine luckily money saved help then. 

Currently making unemployment time state California hit new record cases. 

Not exactly looking forward work unless offer WFH since 3 family members huge risk get it. We’ve proof germ theory disease ~130 years. Pictures 1918 influenza pandemic show everyone masks. volumes written subject. Yet need government tell us wearing mask slows spread respiratory infection? We’re dumber nation thought. goal never get COVID-19 transmission zero.

Maybe be. Scientists HATE him! Find orange lardass reduced number COVID-19 cases ONE SIMPLE TRICK! Good job. dont know people Yup. Exactly this. Gold gold. 808 now, 1 last week! SARS-CoV-2 boofed?  Dude, Texans, Floridians Arizonans ones wearing masks, many/most protestors wore masks. Yeah, I'm sure conspiracy theory end-game would making everyone wear home made cloth masks. Unreadable. seems husband one got it, get. Thank you. could figure because...that’s stupid thing say. 

No wonder Slemp resigned. I'm saying protesting general, effect seen mostly young people, talked reddit they're leftist protests. spike rates TX FL also lesser restrictions, mean nothing unless hospitals get overwhelmed. Stay positive bro Inseparable cult behavior. We're lucky followers weak ineffective, lucky innocent people perish Covid 19 this. I'm used point. like working home 365 now. nature vaccine manufacturing distribution makes impossible goal. dead arrival? Yeah, see one guy left side picture walking behind dude burgundy shirt. He's talking phone unmasked. he's white. Comrade, think need hours “Introductory English Trolling Online.”   think Northern VA taking COVID way serious rest. Anytime go out, almost everyone wearing mask. I’ve heard every part state people don’t GAF Standard left wing thinking, nothing unusual here. What's record past predictions?  Nah. bribes keep stock market high. old news it? Like ever..? people know gotten flu. I’ve gotten multiple times get flu shot every year. Yes, cases spike test more. let's stop testing, bury heads sand, start burying bodies. Media big business separated entire degree. boils wealthy people nothing tangible contribute society, wealth fuckin' worked it, want earn millions dollars less expected year. go die make sure happen. family die. part machine. rich people vs poor people. 65% 2420 people.... plenty studies, absolutely interested. scientific medical consensus wearing masks work. immediately outed cited pseudoscience. 

Me showing wrong, obviously change opinion worth time let go grocery shopping. Either pickup orders shop them. Note word ""local"" title. case found mandatory testing outside country, locally Taiwan. common asymptomatic people tested feel fine (have tested? haven't).

There *no way* test everyone, course people infected know naturally recover mandatory testing (like case).

Those cases *are* included Taiwan's official numbers: scroll find source announce new cases. thought Pope Francis stated Church finally deemed acceptable? *I condition!* Florida like: ignorance constitution either yet, Gatez theory...not Bill Matt want continue get 600 week. neighbor selling house. 56 showings, but..A LOT. remember two days listed, two random guys shadily walked house. asked relator chuckled no. ring bell neighbor answers, chuckle ""we're buy house!""

like....I know thing? cares terminology is? It’s semantics. People keep getting held this. every state ebbs flows. It’s variable probably distinct “first” “second” waves. Source , please? Since haven’t read anything like that. gave Joe Biden’s campaign entire $1200 stimulus check. Pretty sure herd immunity, almost everybody contracted formed antibodies. Read guy’s post history. Chinese Marxist shilling China. pre-existing racism raises stress levels black people. Yeah it’s though lot people apartments school. one hand, facilities aren’t used. other, apartment owners mortgages upkeep pay too. 

It’s hard time.  Lol haven’t heard static X since 90s. Honestly I’m pretty sure people younger bracket voting simply aren’t able go outside, can’t work, work means money, money means food, food, know, means death starvation.

That’s good way go out. Honestly, stickier sounds. blame Kroger business: that's law enforcement's job. they're saying alert law, that's shitty, say they're going risk employees lives try keep unmasked people out, feel ok. We've already seen wide spate minimum wage employees attacked (and even killed fuck's sake) trying enforce masking. control virus despite lack democracy

As far crisis goes, democracy shown absolute 0 benefit forms government. add nickleback would actually good So? He's right. issue done. think going stop spread something contagious, ship sailed late March. need keep country running overwhelm hospitals. Sounds like hospitals going overwhelmed done recklessly. put people though. recklessness see daily shocking. think 40-60% country wants pretend happening. Nothing combat July 4th holiday big deal they’ll stupidly succumb pressure stay open it. best friend going get married September, cancelled wedding. feel bad her, also really proud made difficult call. gets biweekly antibody transfusion Yeah admit never really knew much guy, sorta liked innovating etc. he’s shitty human you’re dumb.

1.	Even powered fossil fuel plants, still efficient gas cars.
2.	that’s depends live. Canada, electricity green. even states it’s becoming green.
3.	so even it’s powered fossil fuels now, grid becoming green cars become green. That’s never possible gas car.
4.	electric cars exponentially growing sales.

Mind baffling dumb are. know majority people would dead 6mo year one foot grave already  fraud like Tesla Stay home best... 

I agree, people that's impossible. little protect wearer...

That's semi-accurate - there's evidence enough incredibly valuable resource worn (all without Covid). 


The ""controversy"" article addresses one academic study actually found valuable (in real life) 6ft social distancing guidelines. 


So very, likely considerable utility wearing facemasks.

So yes, stay home can. can't insane wear mask. call losing homes, jobs ability put food table selfish means. I’m advocate masks, I’m locking economy  Would 4th July surge trick? Bidet crew checking sad shit ton old folks livng there...... ""idiotic opinions"" reflection reputation. supposed matter, they're supposed inform whoever comes current image general public.

But feel free keep sucking balls Reddit, though. do. wumbo? wumbo? he, she, WUMBO? Wumbology? study Wumbo! never quality. apparently admitted roadster road unsafe still pushed release. even today factory defects telas frequent other, larger manufacturers. Like simple stuff panel fit interior trim. Baby dig man Also Elon 60,000 staff, course going good bad experiences working large set people. seeking talented motivated engineers across world order change planet. keep patents open company use accelerate transition sustainable energy. 

On top this, ‘The Giving Pledge’ signed 204 billionaires pledge total $500 billion. generalisation “billionaire bad” close minded imo

(Mb I’m continuing thread, isn’t necessarily directed specifically) People given lot shit JB gets credit ... right thing even wasn’t popular Say aint so! Underrated know that. Another person linked article saying owned 11% sold. assumed more. fallen prey Musk Marketing Memes Nothing. Literally nothing happens. Look got here. nothing. Death Coronavirus system unable defeat it! came this. There’s overt Trumpism Musk. said/done one two things questionable also completely ambiguous. made post “taking red pill” recently meme that’s absorbed Alt Right also completely different interpretations. defended political contributions conservatives… well people political spectrum expeditious. mandatory? weren’t BEFORE?!?!?!?!?!?!?!!?!!!!! No, that's broad spectrum UVC light. article specialized narrow band UVC theorized start cooking skin eyeballs. Honda Nissan set release soon, even like idea owning luxury car cheaper alternatives make popular overall guess? valid reason working, qualifies aid government, use that. That’s rules for. feeling comfortable reason. could seen coming? make history sociology priority schools. 

Surely mean biology, chemistry, statistics? needs bigger focus hard science facts, rather subjects prone subjective influence like history sociology. Remember get reexposed would likely build antibodies reset counter. places corona 3+ months ago now. people severe illness still antibodies even time, need people known mild infection probably testing even April.

If reinfection possible though, surely can't go much longer without finding out. guess people 45-55 count. Saying racist stuff Facebook? Nuclear Covid. Coming soon never said doesn’t? Like everyone else said, dumbass $3900 married 3 kids. put perspective. money definitely helped families. real story TWO employees decided let managers know weren’t coming in. That’s completely different situation notifying superiors still sent termination notices. 

Don’t get wrong, I’m 100% “big company bad”, also recognize average person also “bad”. also care economy way. point stop thinking endless growth recovery objective measure economies. Gaming stopped casino work times reopened. asshole coworkers quickly slid mask Gaming let things slide. back maybe 1 10 workers actually bothers wear mask. wear like necklace hang nametag.

Gaming worried shuffling chairs around casino floor actually preventing spread disease. morbidly obese. Put hands hips pretend really really fat ass. Seriously, impossible wipe.  corporations billionaires act like level. better putting attractive face. Others care see... Elon obviously doesn't. amass billions dollars worth never use level like this.

Laws allow corps behave way, Shareholder Value demands it, behave way. Either change laws can't behave way, change system economics increase Shareholder Value. Otherwise acting naturally designed intended do. Wow never heard this. Thanks sharing. Specific immunity last long since coronavirus mutates heavily. That's also vaccin useless. like non-mutating measles. specific strain think settled life.

Long answer: know yet. Amazon profit years years, make less valuable. Bezos richest man world past 2 years, Amazon never profit $3B (nothing sneeze at, plenty companies make time). 

Musk tons personality flaws way treats workers awful. sadly puts good company plenty successful CEO's there. CEO's narcissistic assholes, sure attracts lot them. thought so, people told keeping distance enough, believe them. enough one person wear it? swear people wanna went randomly internet

If problem it? Ur gospel mindless positivity encouraging words much infuriating simply works maintain current failures charge. mean nobody saying masks alone solve whole thing. 

It’s America, can’t get people even wear masks, basic hygiene requirement. 

America, makes lot users sub, put much effort masks it’s literally least people protect many people still refuse wear them. 

And yeah, side. Either you’re science not. Simple that. good news way. Netherlands slated ban mink farming 2024. Looks like that's brought forward now. I'm Austin, new infection numbers going roof. One thing see people still wearing masks distancing - problem 20% people packing bars, wearing masks get stores taking shop, etc. 

Which say Texas, Florida, etc people still smart right thing, problem ignorant minority enabled state leaders say shit like ""cities can't mandate masks."" Veryyyyyy  You’re idiot it’s memes. 6 months profitability shit anyway. much track record. gut instincts suck. Try mix Kimchi self-reflection. Florida initially didn’t report nursing home deaths accurately. read lower numbers now, though, older people moving harm’s way younger run around. 

It’s good question, though. Especially FL. That's interesting hell. Reddit really devolve lot nonsense really appreciate conversation. wild think Musk similar Trump aspect. profitable marketable. Musk brand investors want part that. never realized much investment comes subsidies tho. happens virus costs federal government trillions dollars put intelligent measures place? I'll admit ignorant countries slower adopt. surprised see kind thing showing Japan sooner Alabama. Oh explain it’s fraud, I’d love explain. Yeah, no, I'm really interested ending r/PublicFreakout r/FightPorn video NC cops, thanks! I'm amazed that, considering state things, would honestly crackdown law. seems like exact *opposite* common sense approach, looking around parts country, ignoring common sense seems something quite well. course still counting younger demographic cases recently push convince people virus suddenly bad without evidence.

All give people false sense security justify wearing mask taking precautions.  swear people wanna went randomly internet. though? say trigger much? Calm seriously   doesn’t mean damage permanent cause noticeable decline function. read people CT abnormalities indicated inflammation (which body’s way fighting pathogens), major structural damage. It’s also plausible asymptomatic viral pneumonia causes degree lung damage; haven’t looking it. Sometimes even get symptoms late. went Las Vegas friends several years ago. plane, nose started run, chalked plane flights dry air thing. 

By time landed pretty sure running fever. ended spending trip hotel room, miserably sick. went urgent care paid $110 confirm flu. Nope - flu negative, particularly nasty cold.

At least, going forward today, it'll less weird wear mask public bad cold can't avoid going out. Mao pull thing? Looks like drank Kool aid Well, least progress vaccines looks promising hits home think school shootings COVID-19 prevented! /s *NFL sweating intensifies* Care give source? want know site big difference compared rest. also question reliable things type since take data first site find source criticism comparison. Doesn´t really come trustworthy me.

Of course affect life expectancy, that´s life expectancy works. It´s based average people die soon average goes down. seem live delusion 3.9k death difference (which could change) would make 255k complete lifetimes. mean Sweden would kill 255k infants go Denmarks number think 3.9k people, lived 70 years already would enough? everything leaked admin - we'd know. said receive hazard pay? said site get? need relax man... believe participation awards, believe people paid work, believe people also need encouragement dark times.

Many Americans ""staying home"" longer Italian, Spanish, French, Chinese (Wuhan) -- need safely carefully possible. I'm going stay home another two three months, people mass gatherings (protests) know drink beer outside instead inside. it’s well known protect yourself.

I'm feeling lot parallels drunk drivers. know shouldn't, think happen them, usually end consequences even kill others.  sold stock day defied orders reopened factory.

 You’re right, posting March tested positive doesn’t mean caught twice, 3 months isn’t reinfection. Thanks clarification. Yeah too. wanted see people suffer die feel good turn news time within last 30 years brother. That's quite angle I'm playing here. wouldn’t risk it, think little pandemic trip worth risk go hog wild. makes perfect rational sense give President United States treatment keep getting pandemic disease.

It ""feels weird"" like conspiracy theory Trump. normal President, received said treatment, would continue act behave responsible way know got ""special treatment"" (many Americans would like Pres getting special treatment even makes rational sense) good leader... wearing masks, shaking hands, holding giant rallies, seen publically social distancing, publically announcing careful procedures take White House protect staff, etc. Trump kinda derp, ends screenings White House, visibly becomes less paranoid acting, pretty much acts like COVID19 longer problem... like everything else, cares things problem personally, longer is. distinctly see loss interest weeks ago... quite suddenly.

I bet laughing right thinking genius trolling. Sad really. Something learned biography Elon genius shitty boss. biggest case point lesson me. Letting July 4 celebrations go ahead would magnitudes idiotically stupid China letting Chinese New Year celebrations continue. China month's two months' worth data stats draw already stupid allow largest annual human migration continue; US half year 30x cases 27x deaths China's reported totals. already linked it. wish contact CDC dispute please so. show death rate 3% HR department Elon jeez. would give crap two employees thousands? I'm you. Police unions need abolished. I'm opposed rebuilding them, along protections workers, fire total bullshit. can't regulate police unions point game, they're corrupt hilarious. need start fresh, start holding police set rules apply, including different rest us. effectively citizens forced follow laws hold us.

Money talks hope says ""How know I'm fine?"" well far, thank you. That's really good point. remember reading interview early person said got-up feeling perfectly fine late afternoon / early evening bed fever. one solar company no, fantastic.

You done hugging Elon’s nuts yet? really drank koolaid, son Good you.

You know I'm sick of?

The people proclaiming, ""I'm sick!"" ""I disease!""

That said, think floating river would fine long they're type people disciplined it. Drive separate vehicles. Keep floats apart. Everyone brings cooler. sharing. get river bank, everyone stays apart.

Have fun!  I’m literally talking full lockdown. You’re constructing one hell strawman. 

Please stop putting words mouth. Yeah, can’t say you’re wrong. I’d like better data. based on? mean see Dodge ranked significantly higher Lexus “quality”...I’m skeptical. truth inconvenient, said? fact hospital seeing less people getting sever complications virus. :shrug: Yea I’m Canada CERB. $2,000 month 6 months. It’s kind crazy generous is. It’s causing legitimate problems people going back work. (Lots rural areas low cases opening malls etc)

I love Canada. agree social help right now. Disagree worth tied work. 

That’s world is. It’s meritocracy. paid you’re able do. Based value bring table. want spending money water hydro etc. Someone needs work along way things. that’s pay. 

The real answer poor people need stop many kids. say someone grew poor went college uni poor without phone etc gotta see people dying feel good don’t ya?

It’s proper reopening country people discipline self sacrifice needed control outbreaks. get advantage getting back race.

I think people know many diabetics lose sight serious condition is. 

I read misleading headline CNN last week said something like “healthy 17 year old boy took precautions dies coronavirus.” article, you’d learn blood sugar control. family didn’t know. kid like 300 pounds 17, didn’t know health problem... 🤷‍♀️ True!

Back Spring, tons people dying coronavirus United States, lots fear virus lots restrictions. 

Now it’s summer isn’t much fear virus restrictions lot less strict now. virus still spreading rate lot less people dying now. 

Does mean possibility virus still spreads pretty quickly summer hot humid, spreads extremely quickly colder drier? Attack? attack? lauded effort. proud accomplished! mean sure, returning normal, cases spiking. legitimate cause concern. 

I don’t think folks hoping worst, instead keeping cautious eye ever changing situation. yeah, access stock market? Yeap. live work Miami house Citrus County week May ones wearing masks about, plus older people everyone else like cares. least Miami-Dade mandatory wear mask business public space. job boss wear one cases skyrocketing mind tell needs wear one. single target them, part response that's targeted folks still wrong reopening cannot keep things safe.

Remember businesses reopening early. deserve survive trying trade lives health profit. Yep. NFL year.  Anyone watching happening AZ, FL, TX CA already knows this. enforceable? Anyone NC confirm whether they're seeing enforced?

Those idiots learned dead large cities, soon became problem people color, shrugged. cough, information needed know should’ve stayed home. grandparents aunt hospitalized you. entirely fault. nurse gets sick caring them, that’s fault too. Honestly, see major change happening country's leadership responding curb pandemic. like we'll suddenly figure whole clusterfuck fall everyone magically able attend school safely in-person. goes students staff. Somehow Americans think freedom solves everything. Yup, common ""Im enjoying myself, want add kid stuff pets, kid happen, matter fast I'm destroyingthe world greedy odiotic absurd lifestyle"" ... living example managed destroy world ONE human generation.

I'm sure future generations would've loved ""enjoy alive rather existing all"" put it, unfortunately, earth unihabitable time comes, robbing possible existence breeding like mindless rabbits Obviously obesity health problems prominent US Europe (and worse healthcare coverage). think also plays role fact Europe higher proportion older people US. 

Besides, Europe majority went total lockdown meant nobody went work. US, lockdowns short much less strict (if happened all), lot younger people getting exposed virus, elders probably stayed home higher proportion. Well America fat fuck Yeah especially agreed ""too generous vow stamp out. business' regular UPS driver taken route week sister contracted coronavirus boss. boss decided good idea go Vegas week reopened. boss' entire party contracted virus brought back coworkers families.

Forced almost pay go pandemic buy toys party get us sick. furloughed laid make 4x much safety house. [Looking back - Feb 6/June easy point blame people, honestly sound like pretty harmless people, albeit naive. put much faith authority figures bad job explaining severity pandemic people, let alone respond properly. Poor grandma thought sitting porch outside party good social distancing. people really respond authority, happens authority agent orange. Heinsberg-Studie inc. risk risk. persons right. Sounds like increase public gathering people letting guard. Unsurprisingly, Active Cases Denmark graph site shows appears beginning upward trend. opinions meaningless here. want conversation not? new records new cases hospitalizations several states, I’m shocked ex-husband's uncle's wife died - CT early 50s. attorney's husband (NJ) recovered. daughter's friend high school (NJ) recovered. know least one person friend friend (NJ) died (I believe early 60s). group friends attend protests weekly. PayPal 6 months. Hey surprise put hat ventilator!!! Again, opinion.

Try again. Best luck. We're exactly things perfectly UK, least relatively little objection lockdown things. demos them, local one 3 guys, 2 came see turned up! poster talking bbq sauce......hmmmmm

Bbq rich. long Americans ""cooped up"" average? say article nothing Bezos naive. Specifically diabetes. Diabetes + covid know cause increased risk. even evidence COVID-19 trigger type 1 I’m continue play Florida also experiencing largest spike new cases since pandemic began. feel guilty. bad things happen people something stupid information available, them.

Worse, though, stupid, selfish actions like consequences innocent bystanders (anyone else people come contact with). anything, opposite sympathy. people deserve shamed (at least somewhat - witch hunt style shaming easily go far). made point

you made points whatsoever overwhelming majority population gradually returning normal, you’ve got pretty anxious person sat Reddit essentially hoping worst. trashcans matter! owns 20% Tesla.

Good day sir. bore me. topic reliability, know panel gaps paint issues Historically families three generations together. Look old census records. Grandmother children families live sometime lived last years daughters’ homes. good thing 2020 time reclaim what’s important. sad things people contracted spread 11 people whose didn’t attend including elderly parents children. I’m justifying Elon’s actions, realize vast majority major company CEOs right? business world, especially tippity top, absolutely cut-throat. wouldn’t surprised major car company CEOs done exact thing throughout pandemic.

Elon popular one Honestly. think one big reasons folks increased testing denial. 

They’ve acted like chicken shit virus, testing, numbers go up. happens people might take responsibility something. 2020, bother looking forward anything. Trump come January said:  

“I’m suspending travel U.S. effective immediately.  putting place quarantine system travelers wish enter U.S. citizens returning.  

Once quarantine system place we’ll reopen travel limited basis. 

This virus can’t see, can’t hear, can’t taste smell it.  Anyone it, brother, wife, children, clergyman, co-worker.   virus started China it’s spreading (dog whistle stupid people). 

Based recommendations CDC, I’m instructing every American start wearing mask leave house.  [then puts mask].  

Go CDC website instructions make mask wear mask.  

Working CDC developing tests, virus, right it’s important limit spread virus.  

We’re together.”

Our numbers would great economy would completely tanked, Trump’s re-election would almost guaranteed.   

So I’m upset many innocent people lose lives, could afford another 4 years Trump......... corporates citizens. allow it. Walmart almost me,I argue 3 hours closed office manager come back work. tried forcing work cash register exposing everyone automotive closed said Nah. try stay away many people possible I'm back 2 months seem forgotten need slap register. honest name 😂 Eat rich! downvote. good point. talked it, wealthy means, system honestly broken would hard take anything away based this. OP said ""Ignorance costs. Ask afford it, acting stupid like silly Americans.""

Its point whole thread. I'm done I'll say one thing. 325 million people country. vast majority sensible people. Unfortunately stories make news ones shocking - course, almost always idiots. 50 states make country dramatically different. state leading country reducing cases, testing lowering positivity rate.

Average Americans well many years got complacent voting. resulted mistake Donald Trump politicized weaponized pandemic. federal (country-wide) response. There's way secure state borders. state well, border state isn't, eventually going fucked regardless efforts. 

Most Americans learned mistake voting new president soon. then, there's God damned thing it. Hearing act stupid silly helpful - especially nobody foolproof answers.

I would ask talking train wreck US is, consider us struggling again, calling us stupid silly really helping. anybody else kind hard time things open/ returning “normal” US? know virus isn’t gone obviously, still massive number infected folks, it’s like country said “fuck it, I’m tired this” continued like nothing wrong. I’m struggling moved new town obviously want go things, visit shops bars such, it’s still unsafe so. people acting like threat gone, makes feel like I’m missing out. one feeling like this? Ikr like feel read news feel like getting worse worse,I never feel ashamed idol,I like cus main mission send human mars amazing rocket beat rocket ever existed revolutionary electric car make feel sad like days pass worse get like forget main mission,he even sell computer software age 14 like wtf look im wasting time looking screen No. prove anyone, simply time morning, I'm Calgary, standing crowchild trail working construction, I'm looking east towards downtown. bow river looking high time, still mostly clear.

Even would produce similar emissions. Also, know batteries made limited materials also horrible environment? easy seems. seriously starting wonder botched pandemic response point intentional. second term beyond. I'm pretty sure they've figured light public transports. LED's emit wavelength. that's needed money demand. still another egomaniacal mogul care human lives. Musk get credit PayPal? started people, merged company, abandoned company's product, CEO like 6 months replaced. Elon musk piece human garbage.  overwhelming majority population gradually returning normal

Yup, that’s problem. Glad figured out. Nah love Canada, pissed Prime Minister, overall love country, love making fun us, makes us unique. honesty joking aside hackers probably targeted Canadians continue take COVID-19 seriously things like contact tracing save lives care fellow Canadians. many things exist within country reinforce fact healthcare equalization payments.

With that's going world joke expense seem like bad thing. Yeah they’re end-all be-all they’re sure step right direction. country said “fuck it, I’m tired this” continued like nothing wrong

What's amusing people who've gotten tired, never really taken precautions first place. They're ones self quarantined, worn mask, socially distanced themselves, stayed hell home. 

It's like....what exhausted from? I'm belief done national shutdown worn mask, would mid-April. late June, ....as CNN headlined morning first them.....""Apocalyptic Virus Level Surges"" Humans different robots him, except cost maintain due October. I’m excited man really don’t want go hospital Florida around time.. big free wear masks. science. /s I'm sure best stay 6 inches apart. spineless governor wont mandate masks would never upset Trump like that. It’s perfect yet it’s sure step right direction. without question, single electric car, manufactured lifetime someone driving it, fewer carbon emissions regular car. feels like drop dead soon go outside? I've never seen anyone like serious condition actually puts risk. Elon musk, proving time he's exactly like corporation shills except speaks millennial instead boomer. recommendations be:
- Stay home whenever possible
- leave home, stay outside wear mask
- absolutely go inside, wear mask

Good luck everyone else boat. that’s called leadership Based oh well since random douchebag bumfuck nowhere says walmart actually good Unfortunately everyone gets paid fairly. state pay minimum $15, Walmarts area start $11. see he's getting at. owns Washington Post? Judging comments, one actually read article.

Judging way misrepresented facts, read either.

""The workers provided evidence continuing correspondence managers. believe received notifications speaking concerns working conditions plant."" Reality well-known liberal bias.

\--Stephen Colbert brush bleach, you’re A-OK. people unfortunately enough justify post really point, upon inspection child we’re dealing Fine. newsworthy?

Should everyone wrongful termination complaint get article written them?

Again, headline paints picture Tesla terminating [many] employees staying home asking to, makes sound terrible. true, might discussion-worthy topic.

But blatant spin. ""incident"" appears couple people got fired fairly routine reason. ya go again, trying make Trump look good. don’t understand want polish shit sandwich situation Right. We’ve never vaccine less 4 years, we’ve definitely never several vaccines far along human trials less 6 months either. least enough sensors, tech vehicles usually prevent actual crash - exactly many drivers may lax. Honestly, one thing don’t hear many talking underfunded packed hospitals normal day. true story pandemic. hell hospitals operating almost 70% ICU capacity average? takes one mass disaster event like hurricane, earthquake, shooting pandemic they’re overflowing. nation 330 million, enough beds even 1% population unacceptable. !RemindMe 1 Month like said birthday party didn’t last long, “only couple hours” like it’s supposed multi-day celebration royal wedding Nobody likes generations suffered wars, famine plagues. We’re also lucky enough live world phones, videos communicate with.  Finally, Tesla also first build system EV charging stations around country. 

Which country? Sure hell goes autopilot. Yes, perfect, pretty commendable implement first automatic driving market. 

You know Tesla's AP 1 bought Mobileye, right? nothign could classified ""automatic driving"". max Level car company prior Tesla used huge touchscreen display

Yes, automative-grade touchscreens size. Model S's touchscreens failing left right. additionally huge touchscreen absolutely useless driving. Buttons much better driving. Incorrect. work visa accepted several months ready pick Netherlands. essential position temporary residence permit (mvv), told still cannot enter country. 

Hopefully option soon this!

Good luck, check country specifics see they'll let get immigration, assume work school papers let received positive decision application residence permit without mvv. travel Netherlands get residence document?
""Are outside Europe? need mvv gain access Netherlands. valid residence permit Netherlands another EU Schengen country. A positive decision application (notification) alone enough currently. IND currently investigating possibilities people exempt mvv obligation travel Netherlands. find solution, read page. then, will have wait European borders open (further). exception made vital function need."" lockdown also went Joe Rogan podcast said coronavirus death numbers incorrect manipulated. said people hit buses counted covid-19 death. obvious wanted workers return work benefit his. Maybe kind effort make? Maybe we're living lazy would...? huge germaphobe even Covid-19? Making visitors wash hands entering Oval Office, using hand sanitizer regularly? Neither one deserves another molecule oxygen. Rotten fucking core. point pretty much impossible neighbors worse terms death toll. posted above, neighbors bad metrics, many neighbors much better sweden: time goes becomes clear say Sweden's strategy well truly failed. It’s literally making excuses breaking law chaos. want media justify illegal activity time now? Uh sure world living in.

Some take advantage unemployment. unemployment percentage pay. example, someone know makes $13 hour $520 week taxes. base unemployment $283. 600 obviously 883. like they're getting 600 top normal pay. get top 
 unemployment realize argument unions, yes? keep hearing people call masks “partially effective” often people actually get/spread virus wearing one?

I'm date latest 'cloth / disposable' mask studies, suspect they're falling back extreme example: healthcare worker covid ward virus-shedding patient coughs you, intubate them, cloth disposable surgical mask block virus particles.

The general public intubating covid patients need full, perfectly fitted N95 mask help lower spread rate significantly. Another thing federal government done dispense money state governments. president portion federal government. think apt analogy would ""don't euthanize child heart disease"". 50K Tesla employees exactly 2 terminated allegedly failed communicate HR. headline misleading, proven connection staying home termination. common sense entire fucking comment section. I'd love hear many employees opted stay home fired. Would good time assassination attempt? 

Maybe China, North Korea, even Russia? competent world powers? Yep.. They're worker's rights, naturally they're anti-union. Target major grocers (or, worked jobs).

Corporations dragged, kicking screaming, negotiating organized workers. literally last thing wanted. organizers murdered, workers suppressed terrorized.. wanted everyone else got less. 

Yes, unions downsides kept check, way get voice. numbers, can't shit us. I’ll give Rick Scott TINY bit credit here. doesn’t fuck around natural disasters. 

Medicare FL unemployment fucked him, don’t recall pulling punches came natural disasters. acted quickly interests Floridians...probably times governor.

I also think Rubio Scott smart enough know sinking ship see one. fired going leave. worked Tesla. sucked ass. 

They basically want double work half pay. Hearing surprise all.  Atlanta waited long time test Georgia reopen. big dumb, biggest dumb, could likely last dumb thing ever do: coerced Vegas trip Father’s Day weekend girlfriend father. uncomfortable 2 days life regret every second it. I’m counting days July 6th begging god(s) fuck families shit up. Yeah I’m bartender. I’m back work fun. Serving tourists right trash. October? We're fast track mark August crying loud. Well, weather beaches. Obviously got PhD (pretty huge d**k) university Reddit. Yep. Even cancer surgeries often “elective”. Non-elective surgeries ones significant risk imminent death. ever heard going save world carbon emissions revolutionize use energy seems spends billions shooting models dick space Given known fact Elon refusing follow basic OSHA requirements factories, surprised factory conditions bad. step foot factory mean heard poor conditions coworker.

But can't surprised someone posts subreddit titled /r/RealTesla unable make objective analysis what's stated. situation probably get worse we're end quarter, means Tesla push hard meet deadlines. numbers meant “scary”. That’s people use don’t represent appropriately. 

Since end May testing ramped considerably, cases went 1.5k per day 4k per day 7 day average.

Meanwhile deaths actually trended since beginning May (50 per day around 30) slight uptick last couple days (40 per day)

We won’t see impact recent surge cases couple weeks, testing wider / younger population won’t see corresponding increase deaths.

If want real beat severity outbreak find data hospitalizations / ICUs / deaths state plot trend line. 

Any increase cases virus that’s 80+% asymptomatic indicates increase testing. given state understand 10x many cases what’s reported.

If didn’t test outside hospital would impact hospitalizations / icus / deaths? No.

Focus numbers matter. cellphone data must boring cellphone data ever. 
“This guy goes work goes home sits phone doesn’t move till next morning.” gets downvoted spam sub anti Sweden corona posts.... Yup, like we’ve thrown game monopoly, halfway through, property already owned pay rent. Borders populous German state North Rhine-Westphalia sealed prevent travelers German states. I'm guessing something vary significantly state. MA, 62% deaths people 80+. percentages age ranges also seem align showing European countries. I'm sure get demographic information states, must significantly worse. thing is, stocks economy. mostly benefit top 1% earners. Americans savings live paycheck paycheck, many faced layoffs difficulties paying rent bills near future.

It's hard imagine economic bubble created president Fed possibly continue much longer regular people money spend. craziest thing even basically pedestrian pandemic response would *guaranteed* re-election Trump. 

Biden's best bet sit back let Trump continue implosion.  astounding. Haha. good. way fun! can't end evil even try? also said HR called back disputed asked return dates seems like even clearly fired.  contradicts earlier statements made (which linked document).

This another misinformations pointed you.

What said like using herd immunity label would indicate given [on supressing virus.] haven't. could get together stop world hunger dont FULL STOP

Please elaborate, world hunger incredibly complex issue can't solved hurling money it. attempts regulate met police unions telling police officers job strike. Replacing entire police force process takes quite time time criminals would know actions would likely go unpunished. things like convince never get tesla. X dating. X’s mom also started dating Y’s dad proceeded get married? understanding correctly?

If so, that’s really thing marrying child ex, X married Y’s parent? see employee posts /r/Wawa pandemic? company better maybe terrible many front line employees. seems countries done well Covid pandemic three attributes. 

1. strong centralized government 
2. compliant citizens
3. respect science, it’s resulting recommendations

‘Murica failing three fronts Thank link! informative — especially since I’m currently located Europe, interesting see data. work sent similar notice. said something like time time dont feel comfortable might job ready come back work. SOMEONE WARNED US!!! LOL Sure. there’s much political debate everyone agrees. Good job, Florida!!! well said! perpetuate inequality. Plus, property taxes often hurt people badly rural areas, especially get desperate try rezone $$. really terrible system, never miss chance discuss it! That's said something, bc thought rude :) hope stay safe there, fellow Virginian! They’re incapable understanding 2nd order effects like that. Yeah take seriously do, least pays attention I'm really grateful for. Contrast brother give shit virus think thata analogy... evey one ""bottled up"" months everything reopens things get moving like BAM. keep hearing people call masks “partially effective” often people actually get/spread virus wearing one? seems like every study done shows masks incredibly effective. hardly cases linked protests, instance, usually people aren’t wearing one. amazing control virus crowded Tokyo without strict lockdown (only 0.1% residents tested positive antibodies I’m sure don’t wear mask 24/7). get scientists never want us forgo social distancing, many cases actually documented infected uninfected person wearing quality mask?

I feel like missing far easier way pandemic places. worry friend, stupid people across globe. Bearing I've saying years now, BMW drivers migrating Teslas. Yeah considering looking solar roofs comes time replace roof... much past months. 10% yesterday.

Mission accomplished!!!

Told nothing worry about.

Let’s open Disney World early.

-Ron DeSantis personally find Sweden fascinating watch society outside.

The ultimate outcome whole strategy still determined already one thing clear: parts clearly failed.

They explicitly stated beginning wanted protect care homes elderly letting everyone else space....yet death tolls respect elderly quite bad

They also tested way little, feel like sort gave halfway first surge focused efforts severe cases.

The economic effects still severe, consumer business sentiment depend lockdown (or non- lockdown) general economic environment world.

I think Sweden see normal tourism levels half EU world economic crisis.
I also think Swedish firms happily go invest foreign economies companies lot uncharted territories struggling. really, know people generally prefer live much possible die, take preference account count deaths. Thank much thorough reply! appreciate time. power 12 last 22 yrs impact previous world class analysis - ""Oh boy. really bad"". bad now? Also stock toilet paper. Hey, boss me, too. Fuck Tesla. misaligned plastic plans. That's know misaligned.

The lithium batteries get repurposed Powerwalls. absolutely correct both. thing people seen wearing mask wearing correctly either chin nose people need learn wear properly fit ""gotten right""? CA boat FL, state drawn quartered reaction pandemic. Can't praise roasting Desantis. 

That said, give Newsom Desantis day reasons unrelated Covid. Trump know science. He's best science. Oh yeah, facts. Definitely bias involved. nailed right head. called common sense. Granted, younger generation any, still... talking welfare two employees impacting welfare everyone's. people want quit content need feed families want gain job skills allow upward mobility?

Firstly, think safety come unions. law. Second, better work environment brings better employees inverse also true. care welfare Tesla, decline, companies step place. No, immediate, happens granular level, absolutely happens one person's welfare tied another.

Unions kill markets believe ultimately hurt employee end. competitive marketplace, employee power go wherever like drives companies dicks employees. using bad logic.

There's even subreddit Q casualties. People talk they've lost family members cult. Thanks, thats exact study always point link, great read somewhere else well.

Also, another important point study building mixed commercial residential - nobody seems caught using elevator, lobby, common areas. prolonged exposure proximity infected individuals one side 11th floor caused outbreak.

In U.S., news would shriek people causes outbreaks homes, never mentioning 8-10 hours spent office infected scientific. Yes, too, sake world. Altering DNA progeny though, that's high stakes. side effects passed generation generation it'll late stop it, especially could potentially administered world. maybe that’s HIPPA violation  birthday gift keeps giving It’s plants crave. Social distancing definitely helps without masks, office seriously opening possibility outbreak happening there. imagine one infected person comes walking around inside throughout day, breathing still walk desk..

Last heard, virus linger air 3-4 hours. Honestly, feel sorry individuals must work, understand pandemic. wish virus affected antivaxxers, people denying existence caring all.

This situation wrecked morale US citizen. old friends anti science, people respected bitching wearing masks. came US Europe became citizen, considering moving back Europe. Healthcare joke, safety net little. things really like saying goes, ""The reason call American Dream asleep believe it."" Lol cool!! I’m humanoid?  mean get live forever? There’s many things want big man upstairs calls home. study indicates athletes, general, likely asymptomatic due higher average body condition, etc? 
 
I know there's studies, considering lungs top shape, makes sense symptoms would milder. Also obesity key risk factor pro athletes generally opposite obese (pls Kelvin Benjamin jokes). said didn’t respond email company previously told OK stay home uncomfortable going back work.

I basically started skimming this. would respond employer sends something important like this!? reasoning Covid19 now... bad! Younger people ones affected currently true cases generally severe.

Now ..just wait month till younger infected adults infected elderly ventilators (if find one) ... sure able say then...?

I'm glad got people start wearing masks around here, idiots protested outside governor's office assault rifles talk going get vaccinated. Fair enough, comment also worded confusingly. Musk's father married step**daughter** (Elon's stepsister).

That said, would judge Elon (or anyone) father's actions context. Elon's actions speak themselves. Human egos. Power corrupts. Bravo, Illinois. Good job. Big Bang Theory needs edit guy out. think true everyone though - I've always mindset need least carefully consider things run contrary current position - simply never learn anything.

it's unethical much wealth world homelessness starvation still exists curve flattened, time speed reopening work almost same. furloughed us told us would return jobs end. Nope. 2 months furlough let go half department, included. 

Pretty messed considering healthcare company frontline worker eight years. mean, also exhaling bacteria. human body *disgusting*. We're microbial police state high crime rate cops make US' militarized police force look like Peace Corps. We're walking prosperity biome constantly go full Purge 2 (where police killing poor people) keep numbers check lest devolve anarchy.

There's valid argument didn't... exude bacteria get rid via air waste would get sick. Plenty ""symbiotic"" bacteria human body also infectious grow control. wearing mask going cause problem, otherwise Japan would see surge non-flu diseases flu season (when mask wearing becomes common there, leftover Spanish Flu *wrecked* century ago).

It *is* recommend reuse masks though. Cotton masks washed, disposable ones reused unless access specialized disinfection station. ""it's ten hour drive"" wore mine outside Idaho must two minutes walking car seven-year-old son yesterday. openly mocked group three people wearing masks public almost immediately stepped outside. understand people assholes it, especially I'm trying show son behave responsibly public pandemic. talk still try nice people mean instead, guess worked out. hope won’t arrest anyone refuses wear cloths public either. seems take month changes really start become obvious numbers. I'm surprised read people replying said... matter time, honestly. Ignoring cough one thing, think us tried ignore colds pre-pandemic.

Ignoring news months, specifically telling always socially distance, especially symptoms, especially around high-risk people... can't fathom stupid. I'm expecting downvote hurricane regardless. repeated wanted emphasize main factors. wanted mention things could also affecting data shown here.

Sure, he’s free dispute side, won’t believe he’s proven repeatedly awful human being. Also, things, quick engagement (I went back skimmed article) easily verifiable one wishes give benefit doubt. would think Marie Claire due diligence fact checked could, well. mean clear billionaires aren’t ethical Elon good opinion office require masks. safe everyone 6 feet apart?

But great know studies going on, generating useful information disease behaviour need info. Walmart? company forces employees watch anti-union training videos?

Say ain't so! idea trying say. jumble incoherent word salad. Again, dramatic increase Covid-19 cases large cities PROTESTS occured. responding, doubting, would like info.

1. I've heard mixed stories news fact true, damn.

2. could see happening countries, I'm unsure.

3. That's true.

4. could see something made may dent progress virus leaving damaged due rushing vaccine. I'm anti vaccine slightest.

5. Siberia hit 100°F. enough, actively defunding test sites leaving states. federal government abandoned us.

7. Get money politics, first step. Mandatory term limits every publicly elected position. know know done. ADA permits retailer deny goods services individual disability presence would result “direct threat” health safety others

Done done. know much smoked weed Joe Rogan's podcast. thought kind cool move actually. sort respect I've completely lost quarantine, he's reacted smart think are. referring selfishness “individualism” magically change something noble. 

You friends (and maybe even sex!) abandon current life course, stop terrified, swap selfishness kindness love.

OK, tiny place (total population 7.5 million), right next China normal circumstances large amount cross-border traffic could reasonably expected hit really hard. fact, 1200 cases 7 deaths - probably least partly memories SARS, can't help thinking masks helped least little. well wishes meaningful hazard pay? Agreed, personally used bottled disposable water. forget recycle! We've shows Australia outright say - nothing happens, lockdown worked. want tell kids boring nothing amazing happened.

Because alternative loosing half family. explain union protects worker staying home goes press lies working conditions plant, never set foot in?

These 2 people fired telling press conditions factory bad, never returned work, idea conditions like.

When company letting stay home, go press provably lie them.

It boggles mind people like defending 2 employees, company planet fire people 2 people did. went public school. Sure one knew trump would ask followers fling shit stage sign respect, secret service agents knew would pelted shit hours, signed for. use lights planes, buses trains. Dude, lung damage pneumonia heal fully. doesn’t matter virus condition causes lung damage. What's whataboutism? Makes sense bring companies. 2 fired.

You word way you. would know, stayed home never inside reopening. terminations absolutely justified lied.

Oh, vote every. fucking. election. possible. 

So, yeah. Wear mask fucking vote, people. Yeah sounds great. already citizenship. need wife. means operating way should, best have. Without it, would coordinated global effort fight infectious diseases. 

Germany great example country go fighting disease. Maybe US learn something new pox party? google covid shows data +xxx cases day, find list state state new cases? Idjit makes concerned spreading virus wearing properly. wish mobile teams like US. stomp could?

Because sadly, people selfish considering inconvenienced greater good. can’t even convince people wearing masks good. vaccine given every two months... can't claim ""immunity last"" clamor ""wait vaccine"". successful vaccine require immunity last. I'm still skeptical Dallas woman's story. claims February first confirmed case Dallas March 10 first Texas March 4. actually tested positive, would made national news. guess symptoms later false positive antibody test, probably actually infected first time. Nah, one intentionally trying derail conversation.

Stop bothering me. second time tell stop harassing me. shitty thing say Honest question way get back campus school/my job flying months. can't get back way. one selfish fucks? Adding Tesla growing list companies whose products never purchase  confirm this. BIL works Tesla, knew ( heard employees ) stayed home would likely terminated. Elon Musk making big fuss able open weeks back , making seem tho unfair ... little changes made safety workers. Also , thermometers use take temperatures around 10 degrees, way matter won’t fever! Ridiculous! beetus playing role. you’ve died COVID you’re longer “patient”. mean, mathematically works. 😞 Wisconsin here, plenty casinos, Native American run though tribal land. Interesting side note, pandemic made notice need find businesses survive things like this. casinos crazy. flash camera kills coronavirus /s enjoy beautiful sunsets (and rises) lol, 2 people fired staying home. 2 people told press conditions factory bad. could know conditions never came back work?

Those people provably lied, company would terminated them. idea makes elon tesla bad really stupid. 1. Antibodies protection know long protected

2. lot pressure food chains 2 months ago collapse.

You close proximity people COVID-19 got well? fuck would thought could possibly happen! That’s problem....people running businesses versus people listening scientists. totally understand contingency plans. also understand likely get worse fall winter. 6 games?  Awesome.

Immunosuppressants great idea normally, much less pandemic, good call there. beauty low dose naltrexone (LDN) suppress immune system, modulates it, kind resets it. Interestingly, many autoimmune conditions start issues diet, namely leaky gut leads molecular memory. keto try keep gluten dairy much possible inflammatory proteins.

Seriously, x10. still significant number people US wear mask can't even articulate reason (not though real good ones). bad.

""I'm wearing mask.""

""Why not?""

""I'm wearing mask. bullshit. it."" simple thinking. One guy spreading 18 people seems impressive ""appropriate relatively simple safety measures"" might mean everyone must wearing UV filtering glasses. Yeah, job agreement HR can't contact three days, assume job abandonment fire you. appeal legitimately incapacitated. comes one [least corrupt countries think onus proove lying. too, man. Stay safe there. surprising white house dialing back preventative measures. knows good care anyone else. true, state can't make reopen comment replied discussing. Okay, point nobody USA excuse wearing mask situations likely close people, fair government authorities literally lied us almost two months president, surgeon general CDC told us masks would zero benefit might harmful. lot people immediately identified BS, people used CDC surgeon general actively spreading false information kills people going winter? reality COVID going us years. Families going skip many Christmas gather indoors again. Okay also address fact lot protests? Two weeks ago would cause symptoms now

People let guard down, also ignoring big thing happened. stories always seem include social person - played golf friends/family, goes birthday party, visits relatives, etc. make kinds excuses, like long, outside, family! Anything except staying home. haven’t accused stranger pedophile feelings hurt. Unfortunately, take lot good people trying protect themselves, front line workers stupidity. 1.	Then listen media agendas, main goal make profit.

2.	I live New Jersey spikes NJ NYC, large protests. think demonstrates effectiveness masks lower likelihood transmission outdoors. events like marathons could utilize masks everyone would make safer. However, thousands marathon runners walkers wearing masks. Listening statistics, criteria science much important media. government 'advised' lots things barely anyone stick enforce it. Government vast majority people country weak, selfish entitled. 100% agree. However, governor lives denial known superb brainpower analytical skills. I’m sorry, TX really screw cases spiraling control it’s much less dense NYC. Social distancing easiest getting levels seen like NYC seems people literally went way social distance Solarcity bankrupt Elon board member significant shareholder.

Stuff like looking alternatives Tesla electric vehicles. overpriced, quality issues company treats employees horribly. Eventually 5k day may seem like small number.

I wonder one handling better... Hmm... Hard say... part reason. also supposed using time control virus non-lockdown measures (increase testing capacity, create robust system contact tracing, get case numbers really low community, come less risky ways conduct business). 

If lockdown done well, large parts US could approached New Zealand levels control virus early learned it. Instead, half assed lockdowns, didn’t enough prepare life lockdown. figure? ~700 now. ~4x increase would pretty big jump.  busy choking Elon's dick respond, wondering could explain think two employees right discuss work place conditions press?

Also -- since apparently unaware -- there's federal laws, significant case law, 1st Amendment suggest employees right discuss working conditions, firing considered illegal federal law. first hand experience it.

Seriously, i've heard many people say essentially ""Well, know anyone who's it."" brushing concerns. like almost lack object permanence something, can't see it, exist. remember someone reddit said hospital Houston still plenty PPE, patients divide segment, don’t need cancel elective surgery. happen that? don’t know say, certainly don’t anything nice say. said don’t really anything mean say wither. is, suppose! Yeah, skirt around differentiating ""engaged wait"" vs ""waiting engaged""...one medical staff, etc. get paid on-call, rest us suck take it. friend lives Houston said nothing place ad far lockdowns opens daily. I'm NY wife veteran ER nurse peak broke her. said much death ages, medical conditions fitness groups. wife seen decade long ER career overwhelmed. said politicians Texas Florida states saying ""it's fine deaths toll like NY"" said wait hospitals overwhelmed. That's death toll skyrockets!!! fuckin sad. way masks. recommendations followed well. Even mask, still recommended maintain social distancing. We're good Florida Sounds like like Trump. Good luck risk they're nurses, risking infecting increasing risk infection. important trip? wait months see things play out?  getting 80,000 participants from? That's mentioned article. Funny news blaming businesses (which following protocol), Trump (as always), citing anecdotal birthday parties COVID spreading rapidly, conveniently ignore THOUSANDS people encouraged protest weeks ago wear masks practice social distance.

It's almost like one takes seriously. Optimism: 2020’s greatest casualty   I’d love stopped using words “shaken,” “unexpected,” “shocked.” It’s unexpected, shouldn’t shaken shocked. title say “family takes unnecessary risks see one another ends endangering loved ones, may die wanted see one another eat cake.” Even guy married doctor family said skipped event knew dangers. youtube video? Please. Good news, masks work Honest question: use amazon? like corporations did? didn’t know much either.

This turn phrase made day. I’ll able delivery room though, wear mask times can’t leave hospital. wife tested won’t wear mask. We’re due November. assume people wearing masks. mind, mask lot good unless N95 equivalent. Honestly, expected more. shows confidence, that's great. week, Connecticut Arizona conducted 1.7 tests per 1,000 people, according Johns Hopkins University's testing tracker. Yet, Connecticut 1.3% positive, Arizona 22.1% positive COVID-19.

Over 3000 AZ today Spain, UK, Michigan, etc welfare human beings working company matters welfare company itself. employees would able say, “if treat us like this, we’re quitting” unionized worked together.

Sure Tesla’s product going get worse fires anyone engages responsible good faith, that’s going take long time, company isn’t going connect firing workers course years, it’s secondary fact workers right safe work environment. 5000? curve flattened, time reopen harder! understand it, caution called treated potentially much worse first appears.

Not approaching unknown threats way first place. 

When dealing unknown, err side caution. approached lockdowns *that* mentality fucked away opening moves, would ne are.

We coming pandemic like drunken gamblers sure win jackpot *them.* pull heads asses stop acting like already know things dont? Easy lawsuit win... would Tesla this? Elon musk dirty rat fuck people didnt feel need mindlessly positive, world would better place. example, u encourage someone mistreated? u tell happy reach heaven sad? u tell mistreatment bad deserve better? Seems ineffective, likely maintain oppressive state things push real change born anger injustice. Well maybe take all... Quality shitposting. Got second. *Golf clap* export-heavy country depends countries destroyed economies. mean, people sub aren’t worth longer exchanges.

But keep replying. mean much you? You’re sweet WHAT?!? GASLIGHTING REAL THING, CRAZY! worked company long time they're probably looking reason fire you. love firing longtime workers hire 2 3 people cost cover shifts. guess older people died one tested them. heard governor say assume states either. Look look link bottom article moved China. There's way China 80K infections, defies obvious. Every retailer certain size this. I've seen Target's Home Depot's videos. They're terrible. Sorry it’s unreasonable ask acknowledge point brush mine off. you’d like address it’s ok dehumanize large groups, I’ll happy address points after. sure politics matter no, never voted either people. definitely fit mold r/coronavirus. It'll disappear summer, like miracle going lie... lockdown pretty nice. Wear mask, wash hands, keep distance, dont go reason everything get better. seen people make argument less deadly etc well. understand people can't wrap heads around fact kids getting course live it, think kids going continue spreading vulnerable? 

Not mention saying deadly healthy ones getting yet hospitals filling up, happens get vulnerable people? fairness, know people severe claustrophobia wearing mask really cause panic attack trouble breathing. real thing.

But find ways deal. stuff delivered, handle out-of-house errands, etc. go whining City Council dIsCrImInAtIoN! Jeg lover dig ingen har lyst til læse det her. never said could compel force law. said state balls. VP Park operations doesn’t open resort, governor decides needs WDW open image, state Florida start making things difficult 1000 different ways. three months closure maintaining empty park revenue, furloughed employees getting benefits, WDW really doesn’t want expensive fight. Ahh yes well it’s angle perceived outside world. keep going little inner monologue thing way realize sounds like. 

You one bad example things going wrong somewhere. bad thing isn’t happening somewhere else. Somehow upsets you. reason New Zealand spending whole time difficult correct thing rewarded dying challenging you. 

In America get wear masks three years bury half family lack discipline people country. New Zealand didn’t bring guns state capital helping other. get play others don’t. point it’s inevitable gets Florida’s older vulnerable population. Meanwhile governor hems haws refuses close businesses mandate mask wearing. Fortunately Australian company close rolling saliva based test soon make testing bit comfortable. Australia, people post videos nose 'brain swab' laugh brings tears face. part protect loved ones, communities businesses.
It's bad, one two seconds. Much better possibly sick weeks/months end, that's sure... Billionaires could get together stop world hunger dont FULL STOP. Theres alot excuses like need 50th yacht FULL STOP. billionaires evil dont realize psychological child id say straight fucking face sheep Wostco would never thing!! guy told everyone wear masks pivotal time period epidemic. know now's probably time, feel like need investigation CDC's decision-making maybe kind policy place prevent CDC/surgeon general/president able give harmful, false public health advice without consequences. I'm saying rhetoric that's unconductive keeping country healthy, essentially undervaluing country's problems going ""but least bad place"". Like what, supposed react top infection chart? Devil's advocate here.

Tesla said workers could stay home I'd feel would common sense least tell employer staying home so--for job. give notice leave absence despite trying contact them. hard call tell work gotta stay home Telsa gave valid reason. Without saying anything, employer would continue forward assuming they'd come in. ""Correspondence mean anything""

""Taking unpaid leave"" without saying anything outside COVID would another way saying ""skipping work""

Obviously seem like big deal company like Tesla, I've known small businesses who's employees fucked staying home saying anything. 

Also topic: lot places ""lay offs"" people apply EI also gives companies opportunities hire back shitty workers fact. get new people actually job.

Lol hope wrote sound aggressive. I'm saying general obviously apply everywhere, loaded headlines tend get emotional-response fueled views = $$$

Edit: fixed language months. Went school couple who’s divorced parents met proceeded get married. stayed together seeing 1st hand knows situation. Every walmart I've seen operates unprofessionally yes probably hate me. okay France, Spain country worldwide implement Britain? British people 'weak'? Honestly agree government done great job, going comment history clearly bias Britain English people general. complemented professional regulatory colleges strict legislation.

Police union dont that. think batches 128. It’s reason here. It’s left entirely local states anything. federal government provided nothing beyond couple pop testing sites closed. That’s like saying “well technically child dead, he’s *brain dead*” - it’s kind wash end Robert Forster's Ed. didn’t say anything, against, unions police unions bruv. Fake news. Walmart, daily questionnaire, temp check. answer incorrectly, run temp, instantly get 2 weeks off, pay. Come it? get off, pay insurance paid, recover. guess select locations good something. 4 Birmingham Alabama. sad hump ton hoops protect job pandemic. video regarding Volt absolutely right, there’s almost always choice. possibly point options shit sandwich shit sandwich sprinkles kind become choice?

It’s easy enough say quit job, consequences circumstances really severe people living paycheck paycheck, lot prospects savings. people don’t currency mitigate risks enough hope pray others take action help bring risks down? 

It might collective responsibility people relying others make helpful choices, definitely sounds like personal choice/responsibility thing wear mask sake others’ risk because, you’re totally right, cost low. Especially relative general cost alternative.  read report headline? work Walmart customer service /money transferring ""hostess"" (tf even) especially right store they've gotten worse keeping things sanitized. try best counter see cashiers anyone else really keeping it. bothers I'm also high risk getting contact hundreds people daily... every time I've called fear feeling sick, get pissed me. understand we're short people I'm like others taking advantage no-points right now. sucks. feel you. store managers assistant managers keep top things either. Perhaps employees shouldn’t ungrateful publicly try attack company WORK FOR. sayin’ likely far story told. 

Can stay home work get paid next 10 years? 

The period question likely ended county changed advisories. everywhere else. making false equivalence. Protests first amendment right whereas marathon events not. risks similar, one argued necessary cannot. Go figure. That's getting comparisons made anti-lockdown policies. useful comparison. Elon Musk trolling lmao Over-tourism? Hmm...who decides is? I'm shareholder

Suddenly comments make sense Lag battery life. cannot suplex virus, knew... heard briefly addressed two experts JAMA channel. basic answer know risk groups - elderly frail, obese, healthcare workers, minority groups. 

People need assess risks make decisions. also say social distancing (obviously) best known prevention, means avoiding groups outdoors much can.  people expecting? feel unsafe person next won’t gladly take job. I’m saying it’s right. It’s actually evil, it’s expected. affect stock? Nope. Check mask ear hooks/straps Amazon. allow wear mask long periods time takes pressure ears. also adjustable allow mask better fit/seal. Yeah. definitely turned like edison. stealing enemies name profit total edison move. some.... 

Do people forget quickly cold, flu, even head lice rage school, family members, etc.... That’s hilarious think Elon spends time validating reddit comments, truly priceless believe mortality numbers way averages places. anything think numbers low can’t coherently substantiate point don’t stay topic. brought point, answered it, you’re bouncing every topic masks nothing said. You’re free bring anyone wish want finish conversation started stay topic raised. ""*Nobody could seen coming*"" Black people higher rates infection Covid messed up. don’t think that’s fair say. plenty people every state taking seriously. enough. protests also came bad time even protesting good reason. sounds exactly like kind douche baggery would expect company run Elon Musk. Sorry, friend. We're going surge CA, too, least leaders take seriously. can't imagine facing *and* politicians think anti-Trump plot time. county people far. Cook county #2 less half many people.

We would’ve stumbled across person r/holdmyfeedingtube eventually. Claim made without evidence dismissed without evidence. Ex-fucking-scuse me? gonna lot rioting Trump manages get re-elected. Fuckers seem think car blinkers you.

Well, autopilot does.

Honestly think whole luxury car average person - segment full idiot drivers car flex care people. Sucks electric car enthusiasts lumped like sucks car enthusiasts like German cars. kind cultural Darwinism. Maybe Dawkinsism memetic rather genetic.

It's humanity, certain ideas. countries effective responses COVID-19. American culture greatly consists set cultural memes well adapted handling pandemic like COVID-19. concern personal wellbeing communal wellbeing, drive freedom personal liberty, lack trust authority, irrational belief divine protection. things maladaptive pandemic like COVID-19. countries communal attitude, submission trust authority, respect wellbeing others well adapted handle COVID-19.

This reducing cultural power American ideals across world, liable shift cultural ideals America end killing Americans South Koreans per capita. 

This cultural, social problem, genetic problem. American problem Human problem. There's countries handling worse America. 

The problem actually relatively simple solve. Distance, wear mask reduce droplet spread, test enough determine might contagious take directed measures, share information authorities purpose contact tracing, continue producing necessities providing population spread controlled enough able reduce measures bit time. 

This requires obedience, trust, people temporarily share others without receiving anything return, empathy towards shared sacrifice. 

Where things culturally acceptable, outcomes positive. things unacceptable, outcomes negative. Much America indoctrinated strongly opposed ideas red scare. 

I'm saying one culture superior general. purpose dealing virus like COVID-19, one is. purpose developing culture excellence striving great things, maybe is. forgot add money important life anyway herd immunity strategy. Dibs commenting ""I believe them"" comment section posted sub Deaths people “with” covid19 “from” covid19. Watch fold minute orange moron tweets anti-mask scorn way. would say would get tourist spots attention, reality planes flying far capacity airlines cover this.  live Michigan, welcome come. great party. Don’t know you’re getting downvoted. 

The short long term effects people age negligible Reddit stupid hot retarded takes. 

Shits turning /r/politics   Sadly, held politicians accountable that, elect keep electing folks voted war. Yeah, saw headline CNN last night, sure meant 180k 180k total. Hard imagine we'll contain deaths 180k unless something changes soon. 

The past 2 days new cases since April 24. DFW resident, exactly paused? Everything's open everyone pretending exist, businesses either ignoring unable check percentage occupancy, well. 

The amount mask wearers still shockingly low. fair 600k Vegas Greater LV Area. Clark County whole 2mil. call jobs worth supervisory management positions salary. fucking low skill hourly, wtf. virus care voting history near much people seem think.

That's implication; voting history much alignment expert guidance.

While OC voted Clinton 2016, first time since 1930's voted Democratic Presidential election. spend lot time OC; parts high concentration Asians, also parts overwhelmingly white, wealthy, older. flew March, areas heavy Asian population (Irvine, Tustin) already masking. Laguna, Newport, Corona Del Mar not.

Whether OC spiking whole right kind moot; *the fact health official threatened guidance leadership* less forced resign county lifting mask orders next day pretty much guarantees (1) cases rise (2) strong opposition politicization following proven safety protocols.

This two weeks ago; OC continue rise. need lock state down. wont until, doctors nurses start dying white, affluent families start losing large numbers relatives. virus man it’ll get five dozen ways Feel bad elderly victims hospitalized.

Ah yes another person medical experience saying like flu. working hospital 2018 nothing like flu. near surge capacity, significantly less length stay, significantly less medical staff getting sick. remember create makeshift morgues 2018.

It's saving economy, hurting early make hurt less long-term. almost perfectly analogous procrastinators would rather ignore problem long possible rather face music early. Given what’s going now, think that’s probably low daily cases ever, US reopening. 

Won't lead uncontrolled spread till everyone infected? community managers (da mas) quite ruthless might politically correct sure care thing. Really?? Fake??? Wow, reading title alone clearly enough convey information, I'm glad someone wrote whole article thing ""Freedom Breathe Agency""! wanted stop say, case said, "" Well, shit"" has, still steer away storm respecting basic Public Health 101 principles.

50 years remembered real piece shit. stayed home worn masks THREE WEEKS April, would done already. wear mask nothing enforced

The problem line thinking mask designed help prevent spreading virus others. one's choice wear one public potentially directly harming many others.   120,000 people would disagree, could. Part like, yea, fuck fox news. larger part like, fuck going let fox news tell fucking think/act? fucking easily convinced? fucking difficult people think themselves??????

Because shares memes anime shit like literally intelligent input insulted Bc insecure are, least know I’m pot head doesn’t mean I’m lazy, work ass splitting wood I’m even 18 yet, that’s probably ever growing getting everything handed I'd worry air breathe, surfaces. biggest concern would restrooms need use way. Wow, even close. assumed one New York counties might population Los Angeles. different burroughs split different counties.

It's almost paradox. city Los Angeles half population city New York. Yet County Los Angeles twice population #2 county country (Cook County, Illinois). Ah see even issue. difference “live with” “deal with”. “Deal with” implies powers going stomp tackle hot spots happen, going happen matter (and agree. get viable treatments vaccines whole world going play whack-a-mole). “Live with” implies they’ve given might well join hunger games you’re own.

If trying instill sort confidence, “live with” wrong choice phrase regardless context far new hot spots concerned, even lip service. neither photo look happy......and good reason Yeah right.more excuses basically means could use surge capacity long ish term run issues supplies. Unsustainable surge means run surge capacity weeks max shut due lack supplies.

Sustainable surge planned extra capacity case shit hits fan. Unsustainable surge goes beyond prepared they're repurposing things last limited amount time. reporting numbers low, I'd bet she'd still job. need right.

I think ship sailed USA. live here. Masks illegal long specifically put sunset changes mask law. would didn’t mean let sunset? health safety masks EVER felony begin with? sounds like every American... Everything, really. automobile manufacturers never release cars completely unsafe? joking? Ford GM dominate recall list failures ranging tires caused rollovers gas lines break spit fuel engine.

Automobile recalls thing reason, always unforeseen unintended consequences manufacturing. Even Tesla recalls. sold ""unsafe"" cars long enough identify issues fix them, like every single model original roadster suffered exact issues.

At least Musk integrity admit wrong use push improve cars makes today, greatly exceed even best expectations car safety. Something neither Ford GM rights claim. dashboard puts deaths day actually happened. look graph recognize last two weeks continue rise day, bad....because it’s almost flat instead dramatic curve downward was. see next week deaths week fully counted begun curve upwards. 46 deaths today. Nothing link disproves point. It’s miraculous many governors avoided common sense misstep, de Blasio/Cuomo royally effed up. Tony Fauci enforce message? way many ass kissers middle management.

Just like dude American Factory talking shit workers new Chinese managers. Ventura, Orange, San Bernardino Riverside counties Please stop. reasons tell people buy hoard masks toilet paper time hospitals drug deals parking lots PPE. less issue people told get them. 

But let's even take argument aside. say surgeon general running statement based studies time. evidence come changed mind advocating it. Would prefer stick original statement despite overwhelming evidence? would prefer adjust stance based evidence? 

Like can't cake eat too. Everyone stupid sticking thier guns despite evidence everyone hypocritical unreliable change thier mind statements. Quite nice corner painted everyone critical everyone feel like knew along. Reading strong suit, eh?

I'm saying pig fucker, I'm saying record idea whether pig fucker.

See works? terms new cases / day, maybe. June 10th seven-day moving average 21,294; June 24th seven-day moving average 32,404 -- +52.2% two weeks!

Doubt. true takes one person report get back pay everyone Walmart fined. I’d like point Sampson county one highest infected rates state 1.5% relatively weak medical system/icu capacity. 

By supporting masks sheriffs put population risk shift medical burden onto counties.  

Ultimately though think/wish people would responsible enough wear masks without enforcement police. Cool...I’m worried future multiple people hours working. Powerful iraqi information minister energy Yet change technicality fired. people say “Musk got fired CEO job” leads false assumptions, sake accuracy, better considered invalid.  Dammit. really want like Musk work advancing technology can’t get past assholishness. wear mask stop spreading it. necessarily stop getting it. 

Wearing mask indeed matter. read one article doesnt make expert. Put pipe wear mask public. I’d rather go outside wear mask, exactly I’ve Er, yeah one. agree, here's thing. Who's going enforce it? 

The cops? Nope, take responsibility. refuse mask many cases. 

The heath department? HAHA. That's working real well us VA, people merrily go maskless.

Liquor licenses perhaps effective, everywhere sells alcohol. can’t true, saw ad Walmart great they’re treating employees Covid /s title feels misleading - read conservative media creating division COVID-19 Health Practices. hate say it, hate partisan. one side ignoring facts endangering nation. got sub days see anything new. saw comment (not course), way again. LOL I'm changing it. think saying tens thousands people close quarters isn’t problem Covid cases it’s good political reason bit hypocritical. course it’s negative effect. everyone wears masks masks aren’t perfect. Oh forget dihydrogen monoxide vapor breathe out! stuff kill you, too! Uh, clear negative Sweeden story.

True lol. actually use Wild West example sometimes. origins. simple idea supposed make way life. taken care of. employer government parents. get paid bring table etc. It'll actually safer, well-tested, autonomous features.

Source? Grief lasts long time. “deadline”. said different people grieve differently (silent vs not), judge long takes? 🤦‍♀️ seems click-baity. 

the real headline sub-title story.
 day employment threatened, two workers spoken publicly concerns conditions inside Gabriel Naro, told fired last week, believe Tesla’s actions retaliation appearance month news conference spoke conditions plant fear returning work. 


buried far article.


I imagine california better things, state, employer could absolutely would fire press conference bad employer was.  (I'm agreeing that, works right work states like mine.) Agreed. number sound outrageous considering slow death records make IRS fast rushed cut checks. want fast response based upon slightly date data, slow response accurate data. can't ways.

Edit: looked up. 2.7 million people die per year US. 37% people died last year got check. That's actually better would expected. Normally IRS need lightning fast death records. fact usually file tax return someone dies indicate person dies tax year. point probably cross reference death certificate ensure legit. Considering using 2018 tax return information stimulus checks, 37% pretty good. Weird match eh? Headline edit 8 hours: *was told us going send checks anyone filed 2018-2019 tax return expediency. 

We knew going case. 

Not news ...but article, _did_ respond HR. Multiple times. 

One guy asked record call re: expect come back, hear HR again

The person came back IIRC I'm baconreader can't refer back, hold on

Edit: said would come back COVID19 son's condition secured job seems Imagine people willing bare minimum protect around them. read article.. two employees impacted, told come back.. missing? high side dimension, called Individualism, defined preference loosely-knit social framework individuals expected take care immediate families.

Its opposite, Collectivism, represents preference tightly-knit framework society individuals expect relatives members particular ingroup look exchange unquestioning loyalty. society’s position dimension reflected whether people’s self-image defined terms “I” “we.""

It means say ""no country earth..."" that's pure made-up bullshit. Individualism broadly distributed spectrum throughout world multiple countries sit high end U.S., including Australia, handling virus quite well. ""High Tech sharks""?? mean seriously, wording drips distrust technology science That’s fair comparison according article.

It would like voluntarily declined stop babysitting issue cleared still talking wife texted didn’t respond. didn’t know wife texting didn’t hear back told don’t need services. show talking wife offer come back start babysitting decline come back. fact people believe anything anymore makes laugh🤣 must clean, rule, abiding citizens amidst rioters keeping numbers down. don't. plenty non mask wearing rioters, duh. Watch one daycare employees It’s amazing much opinion hasn’t changed. He’s always clearly self-aggrandizing prick. Doesn’t 10 million people responsible ones care most. agree. care. frontline workers risking lives everyday pandemic. want people healthy, want patients safe. I’m privatized world, hospital designed do? Make profits. hospital worried profits team staff frontlines worried patient safety, don’t conflict? Wouldn’t they? Wouldn’t frontline workers want best?? controls decisions? frontline workers? guys top? people worried patient safety? people worried profits? live NJ, last week though would OK visit dad (it birthday), since phase 2 reopening.

We stayed back yard (outside), wore masks, stayed 6 feet (or more) apart. still terrified still second guessing selfish.

That’s workers right! It’s also companies right keep people hired don’t show work. Welcome life! Yeah, that's actually completely valid - really get anyone thinks that's good idea, right.

Edit: sometimes grammar good 90% 5 days. Exactly. Im sure people think articles like anything. definitely spread farther 6 feet indoors, especially wrong sort air-conditioning. Take look great illustrations spread happens enclosed spaces.  state getting flatten curve. fair, depending long ago got call, stock options could made rich, important lot people's lives. also pretty large sexual harassment scandal within Mavs org couple employees. found out, kept one employees cause thought could control harassment better Rocket man pushing fucking agenda lies many, look Europe flair, live difference living wage $13/hr vast.

Beyond key decisions decision makers it’s less autopilot I’d assume. lay-off execs raise pay floor workers putting literal lives line keep generating profits corporate shareholders. China India 2 nations populations greater US. numbers go high enough, actually need vaccine. vaccine granting herd immunity by, basically, providing dummy coronavirus targets body practice against.

A vaccine would help stage unless everyone already infected. everyone infected, situation can't get worse.

So, either way, vaccine ready, either answer (finish achieving herd immunity), need answer (literally everyone infected). knows he's doing...

Masks first line prophylactic, actively preventing transmission.

Contact tracing gives information virus already spread. /u/outrider567
 long standing russian agitprop spammer. Admin knows it, mods know it. Reddit spreads hate twitter, facebook, IG put together. cars glorified golf carts Here's [Statista's amount death due COVID, pneuomonia, both. reference, [usual death pneumonia influenza 14.5 100,000, 50,000 Americans year. Almost 115,000 people died pneumonia February June, 46,000 reported also Coronavirus, meaning current death toll pneumonia time period 69,000, 19,000 higher expected 4 half month period.

If make guess, I'd say actual death toll Coronavirus around 50,000 higher what's reported.

Edit: concede heard discrepancy explained hospital resources drained led higher death rate pneumonia patients. ask me, that's still directly tied Coronavirus US's response it. like Musk, Edison Ford true innovators. great marketing themselves, despite shitty people. asshole move participate protest injustice, even pandemic. Everyone accepted risk. immunity unspoken goal.

It matter many times repeat it. still true. Herd immunity never Swedens strategy. hard enforce state borders porous.

And enforcement requires significant amount resources states already struggle Congress went recess instead job.

So, choose enforcing lockdown, pay PPE, expanding hospital capacity, state border patrol... opt evidence based measures ain't it.  idiom nothing pandemics...he's looking votes money. That's flies. I'd like know many 65% would collect stimulus cheque lockdown entered Maybe explicitly allow business liable damages (illness wrongful death) that’ll create internal enforcement businesses? younger boy girl thumbnail left happens ask someone draw white privilege. Imagine many would didn’t build 3 miles new wall Mexico border /s information warfare vote manipulation getting stepped around damage control purposes people would reach like, $10 million like, great! people reach point decide need $5 billion more, matter costs them, people, humanity general. lol nailed  dark ages thought disease spread magic... Clear plastic bag, cinched tightly around neck. Problem solved /s mean that's given. 25 million 7%. It’s obviously time slow testing Cool guy Elon 😎 Vinegar actually excellent way catch flies. Fruit flies fucking love it. 11 day troll account. Florida man Yes. Use densely highly populated city US benchmark... /u/outrider567
 long standing russian agitprop spammer. Admin knows it, mods know it. Reddit spreads hate twitter, facebook, IG put together. Masks protect wearer much protect others. That's states' fault, lockdowns realize compared density entire state one city? going get quarantine quarantine still place. doesn’t even try hide two fired supposedly among spoke lack PPE Exactly. multi-billion dollar decision place like Texas huge healthcare industry. Plus church Well, Cuomo's mom lives private residence. fuck elderly suppose That's issue police handling things rather need wear mask. Everyone wear mask law exceptions certain people based skin color. police need accountability instead people color less accountability Yeah I'm worried flights honestly. Wisconsin population 6 million they've 25k cases 750 deaths. lives fairly small town exposed much.

But yeah flights I'm concerned with. Woooooow mean saying months now? duplicate tests? mistakes made know going forward.

That's fair point. course discouraging mask-wearing one biggest mistakes, would nice remaining stubborn people would finally get program. Nah, didn’t grow fast places real mass transit bunch wrestling fan assholes gave Roman Reigns, immune compromised, shit months ago refusing apart WrestleMania. Correlation cuasation. Masks important thing.

Other measures testing, contact tracing quarantine prophylactic fact.

Masks first line defense. people locked long period time, first thing probably parts world. know policymakers surprised predictable behaviour took place. But, point face come contact someone else’s waste course regular bathroom visit?

Doesn’t seem like real problem use disinfecting wipes door handles, toilet, sink, etc. keep mask wash hands...  too. Im already detox drinking much. thats left mind.....jesus......im already ready go....ive enough. catch aids without condom one main difference though time time react New York late. virus exploded March, state shut hit 10,000 cases. gradually shut course week.

Florida basically Biff back future, knew ends, except instead choosing gamble winning team caution wind. 

Maybe NY win, Florida definitely forfeited. Gavin Newsom’s major criticism weakness Coronavirus hates standing opponents would rather quickly compromise shut up. lucky California legislature Democratic super majority.

Even though majority Californians support lockdown, gave re-opening protestors rebel county governments didn’t want Gretchen Whitmer treatment. 120,000 dead country apparently needs government tell stop congregating en masse follow Healthcare expert guidelines.

If people used better judgment need lockdown.

Tell I'm wrong. Better late never compadre. Wonder type people protests rally’s directly correlated actually believe science. really idea talking you? Enron successful due fraud. suggest read it.

So Tesla, hence 18 years without annual literally lied money making. guessing much investments would worth years reporting investors profit current year. bought Tesla stock today $1,000 said think 10 years worth 8 billion dollars. marked profit year eight billion dollars.

Sounds like Tesla using deferred revenue ""full self-driving"" even close drawed that's people kept throwing money realized bulshit.

Sounds like Tesla beg money every six months; $21 billion private investments Tesla sells tangible good people purchase enjoy without fraud.

[You certainly delusional, thats Virtue signalling concept invented people want make effort shitty human beings. Wumbo? What's wrong it? everyone drives luxury car. Wtf Elon would hate went viral again. doubt that. VW serious issue software that's suppose power cars. basically exist despite thousands cars made waiting Warren Buffet - fav 👌🏽 see. Others close folks here, shaken. yet decided take seriously. make them, death. 18 relatives survive, tells everyone ""See fine. Damn media scare BS"" Dude last 2 weeks friend (who manager also quitting) got us Saturdays Sundays watched anime dicked around part. fun job entire like 6 months worked Musk billionaire scumbag. feel uncomfortable coming work, feel free stay home (but expect keep job do). mean literally talked education system can’t even differentiate two adjectives. fuck missing here? *is* indication hardwiring. Seems perfectly reasonable pack always leader. Evolution weeds live pack follow pack. Yeah, mean, numbers hospitalized cases going up, going slowly instead quickly. listen burzum. Hey now, use directional signals constantly...a lot time sheer spite one seems know use directionals.

Biggest overall surprise many times soccer-dad-looking guy makes show wanting race stoplight Tesla SUV. mind blowing people downvoting this. honest, since we’re already doubting moon landing, 9/11, vaccines, climate change, covid-19 even damn earth round... doesn’t even sound far fetched. get correct info there, Arizona's stay-at-home order officially expired May 15th, 1st. originally supposed expire 1st, Ducey extended another 2 weeks. Sounds like Tracey 18, Fusco — mother 11, grandmother 27 — would sit pew church Sunday, surrounded nearly dozen members sprawling Italian-American family. Sunday dinners drew even larger crowd home central New close-knit clan united anew unspeakable grief: Mrs. Fusco, 73, died Wednesday night contracting coronavirus — hours son died virus five days daughter’s death, relative Thursday, another child contracted virus, Vincent Fusco, died, relative, Roseann Paradiso Fodera, children remain hospitalized, two critical condition, said Ms. Paradiso Fodera, family’s lawyer Mrs. Fusco’s cousin serving spokeswoman. know Elon also declared Juneteenth holiday tesla publicly, turns end use vacation days take off. Oh phew. ready listen local news spoke hospitals. friends seem much reliable. Thanks. like pregnancy. First two months see anything exponentially growing single fertiled egg. beginning pandemic, Viking Line lost 98 percent revenue. Virtually staff laid half country employees Sweden notified. 

This directly caused pandemic. must new since Diamond Princess going on, endless submissions incident cruise industry general. showdown reality religion “Who knew stopping coronavirus complicated?” Nope.

You never proved assertions, provided reams evidence his.

Tell me, happens allow virus continue infecting people?

Does magically disappear? keep spreading enough people contracted virus ""herd immunity"" kicks in?

If strategy explicitly calls *slowing* spread, making attempt *stop* spread, necessity ""herd immunity"" strategy. 43000 deaths within 3 months miniscule you? Lmao, clearly read article, considering correct begin with. Nice trolling though. 

And none saying personally fired them, he’s shit CEO, true. 

You work reading comprehension. why? that's point. I'm sure true claim Amazon also fit category?

Amazon's profitable 14 last 16 years, all. Yeah, I've always one people really mind wrong - really dislike *remaining* wrong. ok stay home, plant opened back didn’t come back. Also couldn’t get hold them. Suck buttercup. replaceable conveniently forgot paragraph, wonder received notices last week, Gabriel Naro said received calls HR representatives. Naro told could come back, though prompted offer date return. Manufacturing Quality still better Tesla free end homeless. Great trade off. True, Whole Foods organization anti-union well got bought out. It’s one many great equalizers human race. Stupid doesn’t care look like, language speak, much money have, preferred god, even college education. Stupid stupid does. results day come noon I’ll honest can’t believe it’s June 2020 people still respecting Elon Musk So, he's keeping status quo even though status quo causing current spike? half contagious outdoors, scientists discovered virus weakened highly sunlight, theory basically confirmed. There's reason Florida huge spikes beaches reopened.

Certain people readily believe scientific validity masks--which undeniably correct--but doubt scientific validity virus spreads less outdoors, get it. Fresh oxygen smells like fart. jinxed we? :/ music crowd different experience. hypocritical, ill advised. Oh yeah, China India classic examples way country be. projection bit hypocritical put airs helping humanity that. they're helping mankind..but expect help vanish moment find ""one theirs"", ""enemy"" state, like Falun Gong. 

Would accept vaccine made Germany Holocaust still going on? Yes selfish reasons. believe ""aim helping humanity"" spiel second. dismissed headline didn’t fit worldview! you... American? 😉    Everyone family healthy. grandparents late 70s pretty healthy. really point, upon inspection child we’re dealing with

Not sure complying argument sure missed opportunity educate younger person. Big oof here. pretty straightforward science: measure absorbance coefficient common proteins (doesn't matter ones, peptide bonds key ubiquitous proteins) various wavelengths light, notice decrease wavelength absorbance coefficient ramps drastically. means UV light starts absorbed pretty effectively lower wavelengths, UV light can't penetrate far wavelengths. key insight bacteria viruses orders magnitude smaller typical eukaryotic cell, theoretically wavelength band light barely penetrating human cells (like, even touching nucleus skin's outermost dead cells, much less going millimeters human tissue) fully penetrating bacteria viruses, destroying internal machinery. Scientists figured wavelength band roughly 210 nm 230 nm, labeled ""far-UVC"". love governor. vote election, certainly next time. wonderful job. Bezos rockets too. wants focus asteroid mining building space colonies rather sending people another gravity well. Elon Stupid Bezos. Gonna need put masks cocktails now. dear leader care safety they? Future historians going look back laugh. entire life could ignore problems throw lawyers bog make go away. first time 74 years, facing something won’t back litigious threats. one gaslight someone *another* person? That's works. diehard college football fan. weeks away deciding season going proceed (given teams report soon), cannot see total shitshow. many entities involved (schools, venues, bowl games, NCAA, players, etc) differing approaches handle virus Yeah im sure protesting expanded benefits. We'll go that. civilized world actually laws things like this. Elon Musk give shit people all. He's rallying quarantine shutdowns, also care astronauts exposed radiation - thinks ""isn't big MSM slander try undermine Elon like always have. follow establishment media narrative traditional media smears instead. **Who trust, Bezos Propaganda Post genius pushing boundaries space travel, science, engineering, innovation, trying make humanity multi-planetary civilization.** still totally fixed Leaf active liquid cooling like EVs batteries. “The last thing want state go backwards close businesses,"" Gov. Greg Abbott said statement.  

Um, maybe last thing want cost Texans lives? ""I heard Elon like this. He's proving rumors true.""

""Wow, Elon piece shit. least start consumer payment service steal 30 million people like PayPal customers. guess he's improving bit.""

""Elon Musk cunt. He's complete ass since virus broke proven he's different assholes world think human life simply something used deposed of.""

Now hard it?

But surprise since made past article tittle  Elon musk aka Space Karen 25% Arizona mean? submit ""Refrigerated Trucks Morgues"" ""Mass Graves"" territory. Agreed. Honestly, could ""just"" (I say like easy, but...) get vaccine healthcare workers, at-risk populations work essential public-facing jobs (grocery store employees, public transit operators, etc), would go long way seeing us sooner rather later vaccine released. Sometimes think decriminalize ass beatings see quickly things shape Elon neither things. 

He even found tesla; bought way forced original founders out.

Looks like Kool-Aid drinkers decided pop in. Elon really shown cards pandemic. supporter lockdowns early became outspoken lockdown going threaten business. broke law pushed California local governments labor unions around threatening take jobs away state. increased production without proper safety protocols place. workers felt unsafe given permission stay home. quietly fired them. leaked emails also know Elon aware battery design flaw cars could lead fire death. sold cars anyway. man thought would hero us, turned another self serving businessman like rest. pulled Woody Allen looooong way go. That’s like 2M dead whole country got it. effective PR campaign, actually accomplished incredible things. everyone forgetting sudden? Lol, nice People generally dumb. That's there's government government said fine, everything fine. ""Have had."" 


Of course. would follow path Spanish Flu reason ""they're viruses""? Literally nothing pandemics comparalbe. need every family US read story.

That would good. would also good family read widely reported story March 52 people (out 60) infected choir practice one infected participant. virus highly contagious, space someone shedding makes likely infection job getting slower think people wisening  *loved* last two weeks.

""Hey need come today day off.""

""Hey need stay 2nd shift.""

*Me:* ""Lol, no."" agree this, condition one's well hinge ability create profit company. need support Medicare All, people feel need continue give lives companies stay alive. No. actually look got ~$40,000 dad made rest himself. Zip2 X.com creations X.com company making PayPal merged direct competitors. new company called X.com Elon Mush CEO main product combination PayPal X.com's online banking product. Elon owned largest percent new company. forced year two company rebranded PayPal. still owned shares company sold Ebay billions. 

With money funded Tesla first ever round funding largest contributor far. became chair board due became CEO sold single car. Tesla Roadster headed towards disaster cost tens thousands make sold for. eventually fixed CEO.

He also started SpaceX time too. companies one point days away Bankruptcy Musk enough money try save one going SpaceX. Luckily SpaceX billion dollar contract NASA saved Musk could use money save Tesla. SpaceX ferrying Astronauts ISS Tesla launched 5 EVs plans launch 3 next years. washable mask. antiviral bullshit takes hours effect, guess means virus survives mask little less long usual. Still least 5+ hours. well duh I’ve done before. I’m resident US citizen always go back country origin save money go somewhere else go know works Christian Wood (who probably caught Gobert) flu symptoms. Tesla rotten brain?

Tesla employ 48,000 people.

Most employees probably received offer.

An earth shattering grand total TWO people run tell 'unfair' story.

2 48k. TWO people, think Tesla bad guy? Get hand it. poor lazy journalism best. worst underhanded conspiracy damage brand.

This two bitter disgruntled workers taking people fools story. numbers lie. Yeah sub recently? Lol Masks shit environment air circulation. wellbeing Americans seriously hope elect new president November. guess wellbeing others well. keep Americans ypur country another 6 months help touristic sector. know, protests thing changed, would agree you. came time businesses opened up, people going out, forgetting social distancing. Pools opened up. Etc.

So, blame one thing without blaming other?

It matter source, matters deceive actions need taken: mandatory face wearing. scared world could lock house rest life wearing masks? Wearing American flag face mask severely racist Let's forget NY governor sent hospital patients back nursing homes. forget thought ventilators best standard care. know may harm good. forget ""threw up"" makeshift hospitals well... use them. LOT know make addressing COVID significantly different going forward. Hopefully much better. ""nothing ever happened"", mistakes made know going forward. sucks see Tesla's side person's. want go pandemic staying home nice. Tesla needs workers can't hire replacements still employed. point companies forced make move eat lot money not. work Amazon, gave us 2 months penalty. took last week got warning Penalty. actually nothing though wanted scare back in. blame Amazon 100% get it. super short staffed time, great me, bad them. 😢 see spike level 1 spread alone mass gathering typically. Sure, it’s possible, reality higher risk would said event. family members around people may been. takes least 2-3 levels spread, could take good couple months see start spike.

And start see spike, danger thousands tens thousands people infected tested yet continue spread. becomes control fast, seen many countries NYC.  American's obsessed mask issue? Yes, help. least bit. there's bunch countries crushing curve without widespread use masks.

It feels like culture-war thing point people lost perspective.

Texas really far NY able imagine different world different types people different habits that. Sure, wishful thinking, hey, get bit. Elon Musk stoner like calling founder Tesla paid title.

Oof. It’s also like calling founder PayPal, creator Zip2, numerous companies he’s stolen idea paid way sweet sweet emerald mine money. hack. 100k+ dead “little concern”...  Buffet Gates. 

Yes, argue Gates using philanthropy get richer, change *avalanche* good work does, fact personal wealth accumulates keeps using fund projects. vaccine trials treatments mean nothing? Years seems bit stretch. worshipping billionaires isn’t ultimate boomer move lol Way straw-man. Nice absolutes. Sith, assume? Fuck, rough. Hope OK. Please consider talking professional aren't. reads like worse shape February we’re going anything it.

Like we’re driving Covid ice crusher cruising North Pole. Dude, secure childhood financially one important things child’s development. billionaires dudes started middle class upper-upper class (Zuckerberg, Gates). It’s much rare go lower class upper class. seem think saying father one helped SpaceX something. doesn’t take away that, recognize children start equal footing. given **chance** reach potential, many others don’t even chance. “Kids essentially immune, elderly existing conditions vulnerable. Family gatherings close contact kids &amp; grandparents probably risky,” Musk wrote. 

&amp;nbsp; 
[That's 7% COVID deaths include COVID cause mentioned. average COVID death 2.5 additional causes conditions. also overwhelming affecting elderly. killed people age 85 everyone 65 combined. Local high school Phoenix graduation pool party week half ago. 200 kids attended. 


Now 20 tested positive, least 5 hospitalized. 

Food thought. Good catch, even notice bit. even possible symptoms manifested quickly. Really shoddy journalism around. Elective surgeries paused afik. Anyone worked SpaceX Tesla tell that. never ""just rumor"". He's always treated employees like garbage  Really starting wonder leadership anything point ego would mean publicly admitting wrong screwed up. 60 percent population - 40 million people - infected, country build so-called herd immunity neither corona outbreak similar diseases future able take proposal government's scientific chief adviser Patrick Vallance criticized World Health Organization, WHO, among others, state epidemiologist Anders Tegnell positive UK's corona management believes Sweden works similar **We similar, would say, #I listened British say say immunity could thus also relevant little cautious using word breathes little given about, says Anders #But basic idea probably starting become relevant see virus, need get. able control way.

Tegnell literally saying herd immunity ""just Sweden."" can't see can't help further, anyone see could online shopping. Everyone looking items. people pre-shop suggestions.

A friend toured British museum way. found website, contacted friend ""went"" museum together. 

And people dinner long stay outside apart. Could ordered delivery. mean, person company, probably even know specific terminations, sounds like middle manager BS honestly. 

I mean, still twat, said public prove it, think one explicitly him. know fool mask single comment made claim two people fired. comments read??

if anything people didnt read article upvoting comment. Nothing personal, myth using odor test masks floating around months. Unfortunately ""pause"", he's already reopened point causes exponential growth. sounds like organization well throughout this. wonder though exactly you’d run car manufacturing plant without workers though What? mean everyone $300 lying around demolished economy go see doctor? Well fair, many alive disastrous response COVID.. seems like Tesla gave cart blanche far would willing return work. But, many companies would rightly do, Tesla needed stay touch get updates willing come back not. Budgets drawn up, payroll counted, shifts covered, etc. company going want know employee going come back and/or employee going come back all. still don’t get Elon Musk worship. mixed two different agencies, SKR FHM. stories need spread social media. Put faces names hopefully others realize risk real. 

I think lot people, risk still real read numbers know anyone immediate family affected it. So, easy dismiss. mean let's honest Tony Stark kinda works comic book universe villains perfectly catered towards them. I'm kinda surprised people still problem ""military-funded operative acts completely outside rules behalf law enforcement"" days. Looks like Abbott going herd immunity route. TX make beds nothing mitigate growing number cases. also sold phones defective batteries could start fire. weeks Gov. Greg Abbott began allowing businesses reopen, Texas exceeded another one key metrics Wednesday seven-day average positivity rate passed 10%, level Abbott previously called ""warning flag"".

Texas needs mandate physical distancing masks. enough *recommend* people wear mask. Half measures measures, virus needs aggressive response controlled. We're much worse shape. mainly NYC heavily affected. Houston, Dallas, Phoenix, San Antonio, Austin, Orlando, Miami, etc running beds. also tragic numerous medical staff face furloughs due loss procedure related income. fixing actual Problem

Genuinely asking: exactly Tesla supposed fix COVID situation?  think accurate statement would be:

“Send note utilizing services anymore try find pleb **is willing work asbestos filled house**”

It’s tough situation sides. Obviously, don’t want go work pandemic 

But time, understand it’s unreasonable say I’m going work expect employer find someone work. job needs done. 

Luckily, I’ve found middle ground boss I’m using saved PTO able work home. It’s weird mix that’s never done, found middle ground work asking for. 

But realize vast majority Americans don’t great employers willing work them. 

Employers mixed bag, financial side general management side it. employers take hit financially “ideal” employers. take hit management refuses to. can’t take hit. can’t take hit bad management. 

I think it’s unfair hold employers one scope, saying behave like ideal employer literally can’t, applies Tesla. Please don’t buy Tesla.  Thanks. thought referring NYC personal experience, didn’t want sound hostile. Glad asked citation. I'd like personally thank Fox News dumbing society.

That's right. one drops coin slot machine, accepting risk lose coin. If, instead, risk getting very, sick possibly dying, any, would play gamble.

It’s infect people infect. really need least 3 levels spread see beginning signs spike.

So that’s many others believe spike happen protests, would mid late July - vast majority people protests, friends family friends family protests. includes many older people higher risk people obviously protests, ended exposed someone protest someone around someone protest got infected.

If spike happens (hopefully doesn’t) dodged serious bullet many areas around country.

You getting saying entirely reasonable. unfortunate kneejerk reaction driven people posting shite hot takes ""data"". know, ones loved ""just wait 2 weeks"" snark Florida Texas they, course, abandon next minimization.

I think big question recent spikes handled, state leadership reaction residents ends being. Averaging 1500 per day July would probably require Texas/Florida/California keep spikes *nothing*. see numbers like NY first 2 weeks April one anything. I'd like think possible. Yeah. possible discipline address risks based testimony others.

Secondly, 45% Americans zero access public transit either way. way opt use super inefficient commute. That’s planning infrastructure problem, related kind power use. 

So cars heavier polluters, also large transportation-of-choice majority society, exactly electric busses “better” electric cars?

And also, Tesla currently developing electric semi trucks. Who’s say busses aren’t coming line them? cases = See, told hoax.

Lots cases = Fake news. They're counting people colds allergies.

They're prepared either way. married Companies driven profit want keep workers willing work limited US. countries implement laws avoid problem doesn’t mean plenty others don’t historically haven’t found ways around it. Eh. think you’re playing fire. While, true, vaccine business 10 years old- that's actually shocking considering timeline bring vaccine market, plus research development they've done specifically mRNA vaccines, extremely new started.

They vaccines trials, notably Zika one phase 2. also repurposed existing research vaccine never planned MERS prevalent enough trials.

A little context helps. also lot riding safe successful vaccine, considering closely scrutinized. managers fired them, Elon. can't blame name, picture, whole article based Facebook post. probably right. Could propaganda. Or-- people unstable areas often fake birth certificates make seem old go war. rampant Soviet Union. feel like broken record, people arent wearing masks either arent paying attention anymore simply care. 

They heard wanted hear, surgeon general told didnt need wear mask. moved on. heard wear one think thats right think themselves.

Unless massive campaign inform everyone entire nation, including huge advertising, POTUS speaking wrong wearing mask set example, much more, wont change. guarantee it.

We live age disinformation. People (companies) realised tell straight lie face repercussions. masses see first headline opinion (that often cannot changed) formed.

In America especially, timeline insane. First 'masks work' 'only certain masks work' 'wear masks protect others you' 'everybody needs masks' found reason people told masks work start want run out.

Sometimes see someone wearing mask - correctly too— it’s vanishingly rare. big exceptions staff (some, all) businesses open public. 

And keeping 2-metre distance joke. People Trumpian notion “it’s distance want be.” Shops aren’t reminding customers observe it. 

The reported rate COVID area plunged, think - plus warm weather, official message around “cautious” opening - made people careless. forgive somewhat people outside, naturally well-ventilated areas, indoors it’s dangerous. always, it’s health people endangering :( optimistic, would blown away real vaccination program time next year.

I'm also someone job home. one thing company nerfed what's going on, everyone able function home, there's excuse. county, flu very, bad (record bad) fall - since caught flu last year followed numbers closely. spring lockdown came also little flu cases. understand companies cannot force workers return work, rather avoid liability getting sick cannot say return work. protect choice return work must workers' ? 's raise pornhub SEO? mom anti-seat belt person took years start wearing one. Guess like wearing mask? Luckily lives area required reluctantly does. I’m sure would weren’t required. ethical billionaires Man tired black white rhetoric. 

“I feel strong negative emotions [billionaire]. Everything they’ve done bad humanity. Oh gave $100M good cause? MYCH NET WORTH THOUGH HUH! Besides, gesture completely invalidated [this thing businesses do]. fuCk ELoN mUSk, jEFf bEZoS, bIlL GatEs giving people CORonAvIruS  People neighborhood busy complaining kids' football camps cancelled concerned virus spreading. entitlement makes cringe. Leaf level compete. poor range exacerbated well known issue rapidly depleting battery life. Buy used Leaf lucky go 100km full charge Winter. Yet wasn’t “just” employee either. Seeing lot people bending facts don’t know anything don’t like anymore. shitty attitude. plenty reasons support certain business. Don’t condescending twat Bill Gates bro. I'm saying he's perfect, foundation, actively tries push healthcare issues help developing countries. US year, Covid already killed 7x people FAR year AIDS deaths US 2017. that’s far (numbers pulled cdc.gov)

While AIDS terrifying, figured mitigate risk create medicines it. People need act covid dangerous we’ve trained view AIDS (at least sort treatment). Well fair, even direction wear masks quite clear children 2 wear face coverings. Young babies (i.e 12 months) even supposed sleep blankets risks suffocation, can't communicate distress move mask away face difficulties.

Adult wearing one though. haircut thing fascinating me. watch men literally melt length hair. think we’re learning men care hair much women. 

I guess it’s deep.. like part identity.

When take father’s car away him, would thought shot him. felt really bad.. hooked Cadillac tow truck dragged watched wheelchair. sad. lot tied car. 🤷‍♀️ big number reality, especially see largely made nursing home deaths, ad unfortunate is. USA! USA! USA! I'm arguing Elon self made, people act like he's rich parents also BS. one really self-made ultimately unless grew wilderness something.  See one Tegenell said article quoting then. 2-14 days. Median time 5 days. worked training program HR people. One things learn ""union prevention methods"". literal title course. Wesla? Groups collect surveys manipulate results time, often clean bad data malicious reasons. 

Some ways shift data way results:
Count absolute number reports (makes higher volumes look worse)
Divide complaints number units
Count number unique types complaints (100 issue counts 1)
Group results year make individual model years look good bad
Group data across years hide bad years
Ask leading questions keeps things now... make anything better... Already past tipping point... ""China warn us time"" Sure, feds can't anything it. I'm saying defunding sites destroy world. I'm saying closing testing sites reducing testing capacity. Even reduction 1% reduced entirely political reasons, f*cked up. No, people absolutely dismiss things don’t fit views. America literally divided it. Michigan resident here. laughed. remembered overweight ""Meal Team Six"" squads parading around guns. white, got away that. sure Texas might take *that* display Capitol. Ooh, got offered opportunity leave supervisor found resume internet like, ""Why looking new jobs?"", like, ""Because I'm millennial long career ahead clear advancement standstill..."" agreed transition period replacement learned do...who quit 6 months left, prompted call, ""Hey, would willing come back help little?"" Yeah, miss it. no, impossible... post even proves it, tell everyone stay home, he'd loose tons money, even lose go bankrupt, that's end billionaire him... Let virus burn stupidity people. puts S&amp;P 500. Projections piss-poor far, makes one different? *The Trickster* Whatttt Redditors said epic wholesome 100! Agreed. Tesla's supercharging network certainly gives huge advantage people like taking long road trips I'd cancel. risk whatever case load town plus wherever stop agree that. reading thought main focus article conditions factories, two workers received termination emails HR. sounds like misunderstanding misunderstanding terrible workers treated Please Texas, please Texas.....

It's Texas -_-. didn’t write anything wearing masks constitution entirely new right? Elon Musk always piece shit matter much reddit sucks dick. CovidGraph.com

Note deaths apparent 3-4 weeks case increases show yet. Nothing wrong Thai cave incident. People accuse random people pedophiles time app evidence besides speculation. Better safe sorry. friends previously worked Tesla. basically said treated like ammo. Used depleted tossed aside. submission removed because


**Titles must edited source.** submissions must submitted original title submitted article applicable. article uses caps title, changed [title Editorialization via title editing kind likely removed. ([More believe made mistake, please [message moderators](/message/compose?to=/r/Coronavirus).* Big 3 isn’t force back Tucker days. real power back then, like Google now. saw market share decrease significantly since Japanese European carmakers gained popularity US. wouldn’t able bully suppliers selling competitors like movie showed steel industry. something significant survive new, independent car company. It’s clearly hard survive industry. Elon didn’t start Tesla though. guys Elon paid listed one founders. - literally terminated position CEO, firing. position board directors entirely separate thing, he's co-founder / owner transitioned positions remaining board way (just examples normally voluntary nature) that's corporate level prank. think Adam's graph good clever. could wrong, think Adam's method less accurate graph downward slope. (The forecast predicting greater addition based previous week.) could cause ""upward"" forecast. said, could well wrong here. Sad snowflake warning. Okay? mean company run sensationalized narcissistic jerk fired people said could do. refuse believe silliness. explain auto manufacturers seem wanting suck Elon's balls?

They don't. companies actually make money, Tesla year 18 profits (with last 4 years, loses close $1 billion year).

It's obvious salty, flaccid little man. 

Tesla another fraudulent ponzi scheme headed serial huckster. I'm sorry company integral identity, though. Oof someone automodded call me?? Dm Im curious People like idolize Tony Stark he's like rich Mr. Bean. stumbled successes bad ideas good ones.

Like hyperloop. sounds cool concept, really impractical engineering safety perspective. made essentially progress it, yet keep talking like built soon.

That's basically whole thing. Make crazy pitch based cool *concept*. Say reality sooner would think, let whole thing quietly fade away essentially impossible.  WTF Spin even *doing* reopening tourism NOW!? sports biggest problem right now, 120000+ deaths counting. sounds like every large company America, period. smaller ones too. Though Ford partner EV charging network that's actually larger Tesla's network.

Technically larger, often inferior slower charging tesla. There's factual way support argument system dad uses house - passive cooling big trees. costs nothing tree maintenance. works! unhinged all, really reaction v normal. equate freedom getting Covid 19 riot? Hmmm logic flawed sure meant well. Take extra Zoloft sleep home hosted. Sorry. looked like spambot posting. reviewing post history, appear spambot reapproved question. story repeat people can't think beyond sense normalcy. Since obviously read article, source headline:

""DeSantis Thursday announced plan Florida’s K-12 schools reopen full capacity fall.


Education Commissioner Richard Corcoran said that’s recommendation made Florida school superintendents.""

I understand superintendent final say, state level pushing schools open full capacity. Nothing soley Jacksonville per se....  sit vehicle stranger still can’t get within “1 meter plus” mother. mean touch billionaire whose daddy made fortune apartheid hero people?! Assuming he'd ever around regular people Vegas reopened two weeks ago said masks would mandatory inside casinos. bunch reporters went found less half people inside casinos wearing masks. they're saying masks mandatory? already said that! enforce then, they're going enforce now. 

People go casinos right idiots, know virus spreads air conditioning. super-spreader events know far (nursing homes, prisons, factories, food processing plants, churches, bars, gyms, cruise ships, call centers) one thing common: Air conditioning. coincidence Florida, Texas Arizona (the air conditioning capitals world) hotspots right now. Anyone thinks good idea go crowded indoor air-conditioned casino right basically bug chaser. Oh it’s party, I’m invited. suppose could bring hand soap tho Hivemind patch 2020: ELON LONGER SAVIOR thinking thing. think less people dying beginning since handle prevent COVID deaths hospitals. think cases go up, deaths small percentage outcome cases. Kind hard huge unemployment rates. Except Ray Kroc actually shrewd businessman founded company (McDonald's Corporation, hamburger stand) profit, merely charlatan grifter healthy dose sociopathy. Thank you, kind friend! Hopefully so! deaths last days flattened, increased bit. number new cases time highs, going hard stop death rate increasing. Slightly different. decency laws place long stores existed,pretty much. mask thing entirely new me, Texas' size, almost meaningless number. El Paso need bed, can't use one Beaumont, 10 hours away. use paid day off, given extra one time. gather provides list disease factors symptoms individually addressed targeted, done carefully, interfering bodies ability defend underlying illness. infected person provided valuable relief yet allow body continue produce antibodies without overly stressed.

And no, work medical profession take say opinion only. Stay safe. No.

This billionaires exist first place. much power single person wield nearly everyone turns massive cunt billion dollars worth power fingertips. 0-99 years death child continued grieve. Anything guess put big girl panties grow fuck up, right? mean shit baby. make those. What’s really sad following state guidelines 25 people gathering. totally avoidable. Sooo.. they’re hiring they? Hmm.. mention revenue sports helps drive economy excusing it, explaining behavior. feel like social contract civilization broken completely unfair you, looting logical result. many, looting seems insane crazy, feel like going killed police reason, normal rules society strong enough people horrible things. 

You provided evidence anyone ""celebrating looting."" wonder too. I've heard several states percentage COVID deaths nursing homes way article puts it. know state least, 10% higher article's average. that's nursing homes, anyone older one. know meaning word average, would surprise rate much lower states pull 45% overall. non-metro south NJ basically north Florida.  necessarily say skill. said skill. skilled trade, plenty require minimal cost. matter wanting work toward goal putting effort. everyone starts equal levels, everyone get potential level. Maybe someone who's severely disabled, sure, OP seem disabled, far tell. horribly demeaning chant start shift amazing still staffed all. It’s unfortunate never taught anything related science. Anti-tesla horseshit. dont like elon much next guy, lets make crap *provably* inferior self-driving tech somehow ""well-tested"" tesla deployed cars later. Thats machine learning, everyone it, works. chart deaths? owners, corporate kapitalists (and Putin), want ""the resources"" back work.

This control, rationality. perspective ruling elite, better fail control narrative succeed lose face (since, point, there's way ruling class comes looking good based facts). Experts need convince politicians make laws, since clearly people goodness hearts  Lol calling Enron x20 would found cars weren’t actually electric. stupid fucking take. think testing 3 months ago. 1 month ago think, real concern vaccine mRNA since interplay DNA RNA fully understood (if say understand conversation ends here), know making permanent changes DNA pass progeny.

We've understood something new RNA example wouldnt available 24/7 stayinghome? Oh yes. There's course detection containment portion. thought would make sense focus appears trump priority economy. 

The easiest solution actual virus containment would sign cheque let Fauci thing. mean experience previous coronavirus outbreaks. probably knows he's doing. get way? 

It's pretty much country ok pandemic. Go gather experts, let come suggestions implement one them, them. Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Still amazes American culture, economy, values could poorly suited handle pandemic. wear shirt pants store? unconstitutional too? Oh, horrible idea doubt. Trust me. 

We're pretty fucking mad. many? Wishful thinking, it'd ruin narrative false. Yes 8 year old taught wear mask long wear correctly? go see many people wearing masks correctly. Even restaurants. 

Masks absolutely worn feel enough emphasis utilize correctly.

People wear mask mouth nose. touch mask adjust mask without washing hands. sanitize masks.

Start paying attention go out. cautious correlated figures, correlation causation. People take disease seriously likely wear mask, take social distancing seriously, use hand sanitiser, etc.

Yes, masks may well help (especially ""My mask you, mask me""), also likely co-indicator common cause. See issue people, like person replying to, discouraging people wearing masks, effective way mitigate spread (if everyone wearing them). comment discourage anyone social distancing staying home. No, didn’t marry, child together. child his... step-nephew/half-brother.  Squawk lot shit everything? daddy’s blood diamond mines count ok?! like trump empire “small” 400 million dollar loan dont count either Why? say are. interesting see actually do. players staff infected every sport already. Hoping continues improve. know disease better treatment options. heard avoid ventilation longer poor success rate. Nevada's latest case/death charts, along running way up, deaths far. seem like forward thinking ideas here. I'm regulations seem like changes could really help wake disease. that? Sweden?

Personally I’d rather live place without strong centralized government citizens aren’t sheep. that’s me.

Oh yeah, world’s leading research universities US too, third “point” BS.

But probably don’t care searching truth government determine you. Elon living breathing Sour Patch Kid sheesh.. except sweet part comes first point, called TRUMP FLU. mirrors must commissioned government target pilots planes flew twin towers, towers melt steel. FITS! live km world headquarters, Bad Homburg, Germany obliged law worker's council. workers council representation supervisory board. Damn really thought good luck Gee, kinda sound like guy know spends lot time Twitter. know mortality rate localized area completely pointless right? number high you’re testing severe risk people. too, keep safe ! forgive take anything federal agency says huge pile salt right now. northeast U.S. well right now, wonder long keep up? increased traveling summer season July 4th coming up, infected people suddenly cause mild resurgence?

Probably, plan NY, NJ CT low numbers contact tracing set large spikes make things worse. 

That’s plan, we’ll see works way. Elon soon try ban handjobs Reddit breaks arm jerking off.

Ethical billionaire oxymoron. I'm sure guy absolutely credentials mostly throws opinion reliable. vaccine herd immunity constantly flex can, going 60 55 two lane back country highway here, behind farm dually going 60 well. guy behind Tesla fucking handle passed double yellows, endangering everyone... 

Dickhead cashier stopped hunting proper cleaner and/or paper towels. Hard constant stream customers(very masks/no distancing). suppose could use hands rub glass cleaner over, cleaner. I'm suspicious even soap bathrooms, whatever instantly dries soon hits skin. 

I've got hand sanitizer I'm taking care point. I'm outside Philly Delco.

In stores obv they're compliance 100%. wearing often removing them, too. recover rate around 80% currently, there's also townships great numbers (like nearly 1% Middletown township died it. 1% got it, 1% residents died this). Statewide recovery 78%. 

We road trip planned visit family also isolating. I'm pretty sure we'll return another hotspot. officially enter green phase tomorrow. 

Attitudes I've seen weigh heavier ""ready feel like over"" side. Naturally, anecdotes data. would happy wrong. speed, also range design. Like Volt also slow fuck least nice looking actually drive long distances (albeit gasoline). Respect. calculate way mask mask problem. wear mine don’t wanna wear fine ! kick standing next don’t cry shoulda mask wouldn’t get kicked. 

I’m fine personal choices. fine mine kick you. Good, choice stay home choice replace Naaaah dude Boris said one meter bit fine. swarm beach good time. Nothing happen.


/s  Literally impossible enforce without martial law weren't. place business set policy, basically. Wow, VT halted elective surgeries March many cases. Insane states waited last minute. risk medical work force need, PPE used electives, time could whatever room preparations. guess good least, dang. weird people understand *global economy* *global pandemic* global. Country-level thinking going futile effort long-term aspects. really mean Jack shit bc bars packed people throwing massive parties starve? Where's stimulus? Where's UBI? People can't afford ""Sheep"" wear one apparently, I've heard. Never forget surgeon general told us three months ago: ""Seriously people, STOP BUYING MASKS""

and Fauci told us two months ago ""There's reason walking around mask""

All facts. I'm happy live far family know would give crap visiting them. Right can't talk mom keeps insisting seeing brother lives multiple people isolate works warehouse. told mom sucks worry brother visiting giving virus kills know forgive him. told think way. replied brother special get virus easily everyone else isolating. find amusing. blame game way get people unite start playing team Absolutely, well said. hope wonderful day. hate it, got mandated wear mask NC they’ve already come basically said won’t enforce it’s less optional. many obese underlying health conditions.... US literally cannot Wuhan did. would unrest Try one ear saver things. wear clear plastic face shield much better off. Sorry, he’s preparing anything. He’s way behind curve. last ditch effort make seem like hero. work ER 1/3 rooms holding ICU IMU’s full. Houston’s ICU’s 97% capacity right now. He’s miserably failed dismiss politics economics public health crisis communities pay it. Either need sociopath become filthy rich becoming filthy rich makes people sociopaths. need cut cancer society. Ask Israel, instituted quarantines seems helped there. almost given discourage travel hot spots avoid contagion.  also don’t need hard data simply model it. I’m sure access models place like CDC. Lol Cuomo forced nursing homes accept coronavirus patients. NYC one worst hit places earth. Cuomo needs shut fine, [coronavirus Cuomo good say none states well well.

NJ, MD even CA's early response good would argue Ohio ok well. crazy assume I've already it? background info..

I'm Georgia seeing two guys past month half weekly. two mfers went eat first day restaurants opened dining mfers. really feel like wearing mask type. goes large gatherings frequently. One goes gym often. 

Go ahead judge dating choices. blame you. 

Now finished rightfully judging, back original question. 
How crazy would mfers somehow avoided getting gotten yet? Like there's way yet based them. got swab tested days ago going lake came back negative. got antibody test back April came back negative too. parties played politics virus. Neither side moral high ground here. Dems encouraged protests hundreds people packed together. bitterly fought stopping immigration air travel affected countries. 

The GOP often ignored science, opened things fast, told us wear masks first, lined political views. mean every job going $100k+

Unfortunately labor value, it’s reality. 

For amount experience required Walmart, $13+ hour really isn’t terribly unreasonable depending live. 

I know reddit likes live utopian fantasy jobs pay $200,000 year that’s labor market works. /u/outrider567
 long standing russian agitprop spammer. Admin knows it, mods know it. Reddit spreads hate twitter, facebook, IG put together. I've someone repeatedly defending around months. irony anyone knows professionally I've major critic many things think wrongly, inefficiently, foolishly long time. I've forced defensive position vast, vast majority anti-WHO criticism around reddit since pandemic happened founded gross amount ignorance and/or political propaganda. 

Of course perfect lot room grow change. even saying ""not means operating way should"" true. room change many ways large operating way should. also best moment, many people think is. 

Those criticize need place knowledge, ignorance. learned pandemic know news pieces probably know enough much opinion. CDC needs stop putting foot mouth, ffs.  someone explain way thinking me? really don’t understand Florida Governor want understand logic here. (You catch even flies poop breaks idiom guess) lawyer moron asked ridiculous sum money damages, essentially poisoning whole case judge jury. 🎫 ticket good one (1) yike, I’d like turn 4 couple big yikes.

Also, bathroom could use? need throw up. excuse though. Followed “well old preexisting conditions inevitable.” born raised Missouri lived west coast while. I'm sorry can't call glorified knobs ""mountains""! 😏 Jesus christ, metaphor killing flies either way. FREEDOM lost wearing murderous mask! /s Bless heart. No, no! way successful company pay random strangers nothing really really nice suddenly BOOM productivity goes roof everybody makes millions dollars. DIDN’T READ STUDIES?! I've read young people catching now. know theres current research older Americans CFR going staying steady start lowest seniority.**

FFS child, learn read fly handle like that. asked Florida seen statewide mandatory mask mandate, Gov. Ron DeSantis said Tuesday believes ""you catch flies honey vinegar.""

This far made article. Agreed. improvement.at least. Concussions spinal injuries puts kids hospitals doesn’t end season would this? said musk cares lives certain extent responded changed subject entirely. miss point, responding something nothing something said first place, tried include said merge two. Glad sent economic advisor talk us doctor like Fauci Birx. way know sure- like didn’t already- door chose go through. Awaiting updates new policy advisor Sammy Hagar. One every 16.5 people remember TDK came lot right-wingers drooling fact found Joker tapping entire city's cell phones spied everyone. 

Keep mind I'm personally bothered that, central gambit fiction world crafted around whatever narrative going for, considering saw people deadass complaining Zootopia Paw Patrol Twitter think funny one's raised stink superhero movies. stand comment ""When attach criminal penalties something, gotta enforce it,"" DeSantis said. ""The question is: parts Florida really good use resources?""

The answer question yes. pandemic. 

This terrible response probably Florida bad right now. linked contact tracers allowed ask attended protest. lol. least kept composure haha college football, is, fans stands, put end sports altogether lot schools. don’t make profit sports, football subsidizes athletic department. Power 5 schools probably fine. Maybe make cuts lesser sports, soon recover pandemic able bring back fans back stands large TV contracts. many smaller schools, however, death knell athletics, many desperate season.

[Here LSU’s balance sheet couple years ago. football team made $56 million whole athletics took $34 fake news. got exemption DOT suspend service due passengers flying cornoavirus.  land love heart golden Home, means Nevada me. every day shit. Yup. Think little testing beginning, many asymptomatic mild don’t even need medical attention bother getting tested, many could’ve diagnosed flu beginning instead COVID-19 etc combined we’re seeing south west right now. 

Tough put exact number I’m expert it’s definitely way, way higher official count. live TX.  damned do, damned attitude many people here. 

If we'd stayed lockdown kept case numbers people fighting screaming hoax, businesses defying orders stay closed getting huge amounts local support, people clamoring reopen defiantly running around public without masks, passive-aggressive violating social distancing, etc. 

Those people never going believe serious happened people knew personally.  forced reopening happen. think looks really cool Covid may triggering type 1 diabetes healthy people. OK fine, but, criticism journalism?

Are saying think he's lying OK play words increase sex appeal?

BTW - happened 2 weeks? 1 now? Masks also help LOT reducing touching face. play pick lips ton I'm idle really cut zero public! give lot credit. Although examples China Italy, New York really trial balloon deal go lot error found right formula. wonder color flag Arizona... we're nearly double positivity right now. used Tesla fanboy. Elon Musk's crazy erratic behavior went cool nutty. coronavirus happened showed us really is. love car love mission, he's still rich guy trying get keep money regardless cost. What? Source? agree. saying anyone anything. hope not. mean, become crystal clear people learn change behaviors except experience; still, may learn faster seen happened elsewhere. New York City critically steep curve, health care still inexperienced management. well-known ways people change behavior steeply cut effective transmission rate. Nope,

All Asia knew masks worked. entire Asian continent fewer COVID cases America.

This policy failure America. Fired. Plain simple. General deliberate insubordination would get rest us fired. disagree sentiment, addressing individual. \*cough\* agree, flippant. 
I replying link original commenter had, actual product made, rather worker safety. yet, Texas, Florida, Arizona California hitting new daily records. heat enough beat stupidity. Especially people going inside Churches stores unmasked large numbers. masks form tyranny Trump said it’ll disappear like miracle. Also, it’s China’s fault things got bad US. June/July 2018, Elon got slammed response Thai Cave Rescue accused first-responder pedophile saying submarine work. Elon unpopular social media month two Tesla's stock price suffered.

2 months later (September 2018) Elon went Joe Rogan's podcast puffed blunt. Around time huge amount positive Elon content started showing social media, he's regarded meme-lord internet denizens since.

Elon likely paid public relations firm LOT money intentionally craft image. would order seniority layoff situation? Retail sales US dropped 50% weeks lockdowns started. Cell phone data shows total drop overall movement that. numbers match number Americans supported lockdowns (78 80%) around number support locking (65%). Unfortunately, minority vocal visible. 

Out (PNW) we’ve clearly got rural idiots, mask use distancing caught shockingly well. went camping last weekend, didn’t stop anywhere I’m careful, folks could see drove small towns masked up. Every hiker passed masked gave room. know things currently looking ugly, there’s still hope. B-b-but deity himself, Elon, would NEVER something like right? thats actually happens Elon around Absolute nightmare fuel. Imagine thinking fake, responsible possibly killing family members. hear ya. made mask dense cotton, polypropylene flannel layered different materials combined add effectiveness saw. Better one worry oneself ones family...

if others wanna not...then choose faced ""no shirt, shoes, mask...no service"" simple. right business. wanna wear mask, fine. choose patron. people work customers rights take precedence. also little kid adopted. California American covid-19 hotspot Friendly reminder us pleebs suffer, rich got 500 billion oversight. Grandpa grandma stupid, attend party?? Would like see source google data mining you. that's friends do. read article? Two employees told fired one far told HR come back.

It's like went fired everyone come in. employees let go coming back follows reason two let go that.

This click-bait articles bad, feed existing bias allow people make thoughtless statements like yours. may plenty reason lose respect Elon, get baited believing anything says something disparaging without critical thought. contend state, county, local regulations conflicting.

Looking things spiralling control less three weeks started partially reopen things makes think foolish even consider playing season anything. Yep, simply aware human nature acknowledging flaws huge step right direction. Everybody kinds things time time, that's okay, human. self-aware skill itself. highly self-aware, admitting fault coming terms negative aspects human nature get far life. pretend like use science fully unbiased avoid human nature. flip side cancel season thats whole new shit show together, double edged sword libfart people belong jail Maybe read article you’ll understand.

Stealing another poster : Judging comments, one actually read article.

The headline makes sound like Elon Musk told everyone go home, sent everyone pink slips.

The article says two people terminated returning work HR attempted contact them, presumably ask they'd returning work. knows else went decision? Maybe already crappy employees.

Or maybe not. really think Elon Musk office saying, ""I want fire Bob Amanda scared Coronies, nyeehhahah.""?”

Wtf want Tesla do? Hold position call work say “hey I’m ready come back”. HR tried get ahold couldn’t. Except norm... exactly Walmart pays now. get 500 dollar bonus staying 90 days another 500 bonus staying 6 months. distribution centers also start $18.50 get new hire bonuses. 2 years pay $21.30. wasn’t way started however many years ago doesn’t mean it’s way now. Yeah, far 1% infected resulted 20,000 dead. Throws cold water herd immunity plans. #Translation

Denmark given new travel guides. valid Saturday.

The Foreign Ministry published
new travel guides valid Saturday.

This means 25 European countries opened, where, due corona epidemic, travel advised.

Travel six countries Europe still **not** advised . applies Romania, Portugal, United Kingdom, Ireland, Malta Sweden - northern region Västerbotten exempt.

- Today's relaxation travel guide shows Denmark Europe stand significantly better place dared hope short time ago. new travel guidance map also shows quite clearly varied situation still is, says Foreign Minister Jeppe Kofod (S).


The new travel guidances based objective criteria. Among things, number infected persons must less 20 infected per 100,000inhabitants
.

The list open countries updated weekly - probably every Thursday 4 pm.

#Travelers welcome Denmark

With new travel guidance, possible travel regions infection much powerful national average.

For example, several German states introduced ban overnight tourists German states, blossoming corona-infected citizens.

However, State Serum Institute regularly publish lists regions Europe particularly high rate infection.

If country changes color red shuts traveling here, Department Foreign Affairs’ advice ""you finish holiday"" take corona test back Denmark.

The color many countries turns yellow Saturday, also means countries landed inhabitants free travel Denmark - **if noticeably document least six nights entry**.

Although travel 25 European countries open, visitors must continue take precautions take extra care minimize
the risk infected coronavirus. It’s good news! that's exactly fools waiting for. someone know becomes sick take seriously, fail understand time gets gone beyond point return. Yesterday meeting press conference President Poland. well either virus, dont know say.... *pedo bear vibe intensifies* hope cohorting. kids mask one class. kids without mask another one

That's fascinating opportunity study right there. ""let's meet trail go hike"" bad? privileged? think cities end like NYC was? I’m IATSE well love organization.

Hypocrisy level: 100% reading Elon Musk biography, say dude neurotic expectations it, everyone else able to. excerpt working multiple 20 hour days row complete project early. Great, everyone. cases low, blow Exact deal Stop Shop NE. We're probably going another strike calms enough.

The culture horrible. contrast months ago, jumping hard outbreaks. German outbreak region harsh response, rest country go on. Elon Tusk instead... Genuinely asking: exactly Tesla supposed fix COVID situation? 

Well could start working staff provide safe working conditions.

From said Tesla failing follow social distancing guidelines, lax enforcement rules concerning masks sanitation machinery. also complain little transparency company new cases infection, well response.


I want address solution quoted below. Luckily, I’ve found middle ground boss I’m using saved PTO able work home. It’s weird mix that’s never done, found middle ground work asking for.

You collecting partial unemployment reduced hours. Bet company tell option. great let use PTO make pulling employment think it’s unfair hold employers one scope, saying behave like ideal employer literally can’t, applies Tesla.

Weird, global pandemic workplace safety highly regarded facet worker protections. possible without major cut bottom line that's good anymore?

Regarding sports leagues, used big fan, sports become politicized, noted story presidential visits, become less less interested. Since leagues shut down, even miss them. need ESPN them. Calling driver assist features aren’t fully autonomous “autopilot” clearly misled lot Tesla owners thinking car drives itself, leading unnecessary deaths evil. virus takes long, LONG time kill people.

“Only old people dying,” aren’t. (Maybe super popular, get lots nice emails always someone it.)

Efficiency Everything Huh? 80% spring volumes less back normal since close time high back then.

The main limiting factor ramping across industry right casting capacity that's slow get volumes back up. jesus h christ. mission getting rich. really hope US vaccine properly vetted. American institutions regarding gandering pandemic displayed less honest somewhat “compromised” respects. suggest getting sign says ""quarantine due possible covid exposure test results come back"" Yeah, spring breakers also lot sweat saliva exchange, great comparison.

That said, we've also studies effectiveness sunlight tamping infection, maybe hard them.

HuManITaRian SUperp0wer summarize wear two three sentences.

If emphasis making people wear masks, would also necessary instructions wear them. people wearing properly would show people arent doing. Instead stores workers wearing them, dont really care nose out.

Lets deal people wearing masks. Proper use easier that. Central PA - mask usage definitely tapering off. county entered ""green phase"" couple weeks ago, I'd say 75% people saw public wearing masks. number basically inverted like 25%. 

Can't speak Philly Pittsburgh, might well different states. rest PA (aka Pennsyltucky) basically deep south, amount ""mah rights"" arguments.

1.) still herd immunity, virus probably rapidly burned many population centers (NYC, Boston, Chicago, Detroit, etc.) burning population centers largely spared Wave 1.0 (we currently wave 1.1)

2.) fatality rate FAR lower expected continue decrease know treat severe cases.

What don’t know whether burn rate significant virus largely disappear like SARS-1 2003 whether second wave. long term immunity already exposed, harder virus find hosts Wave 2.

Churchill right. always count Americans right thing... trying every possible way first.

We nation gambling addicts think us means always end winning. “Ventilators big deal king ventilators. many ventilators.” They're dismissing facts, they're dismissing scientific research.

Science based theories, time good robust theories. theories based evidence. evidence changes collect better data sets, theories change better modern explanations. 

What we've done cede word theory idiots say ""yeah well that's theory"" theories robust. Relativity ""only theory"" well, mean Einstein idiot spouting opinion. so, entered never ending argument that's embedded jargon, destined fail lose. need stop ever want win argument science important data powerful. People correct question methods data collection, tell theory fact, makes seems like methodology 100% certain screw alter theory...then look foolish ""facts"" wrong.

Unfortunately lot politics gets involved decision. news buddy think worst pandemic / time human history you’re BIG shock... there’s many, many elderly who’ve recovered fine media chooses report recoveries advised would send wrong message. I'm shocked, can't believe this, omg........bro....omg.....wtf............omg... First all, allegations. showing one side story. 
But guess would like throw light fact Washington Post owned Bezos recently Elon criticized Amazon Publicly. 

Just saying consume information Pinch Salt. people dont read article way. literally quoted know issue is. supposed check schedule every day Internet existed?

Also electronic lock giving code. claim meter broken. already send Hoa blunt email, probably could’ve worded better told they’re coming house period. That's entirely false also far true.

Every single time deniers say something like that, somehow expecting it'll different time. 

*States start opening up*

""See, cases going up!""

*Weeks later cases start going up...*

""Well... see, hospitalizations going up!""

*Weeks later hospitalizations start going up...*

""Well... see, deaths going up!""

*sigh* Dunno anyone accommodate there. guarantee family loyal customers?  Deaths trended 70 percent 7 day rolling average May 1 compared rest word 10-15 percent time period. Doubt midsommer effect reporting way since May 1. National Board Health also issued clear far reaching recommendations distancing, limiting travel, movement social interactions etc. like people Sweden imposed restrictions spite government agency recommended. recommendations FHM like ""It would really great would..."", taken seriously part. isn’t first case unbearable dick employees. expects work long hours without seeing families like does. THANK YOU. remember AVERAGE Redditor like 21. get yet. Never kid assume? anonymous source mom fucking weird? seems like Cruellea Deville personified.

Less human suffering. mix both, actually. whatever want.  wife even able give dad hug last four months, random spend 45 minutes close contact. infuriating. problem is, favoring bold endangers everyone -- evinced coronavirus surge US, much states counties rejected lockdowns masks. Yeah know reading actual papers (and always news articles either, tbh), get claim pro-science, like masks. 

The paper linked detailed criticism pro-mask study - mathematical long (well 5 pages), highly recommend you. criticized study made elementary mistakes data analysis went make overblown claims based that. happens - idea science snuffed peer review. Now, peer review failed. Why? likely answer tribalism - reviewers ""with masks"" missed blaring problems. 

The criticized paper retracted yet, likely (and be). Then, headlines ""Major pro-mask paper top journal retracted, mistakes analysis"". probably see public mask wearing. keep hearing story different places; Cali, Texas, Florida, etc. one remember clearly Pinal County Arizona sheriff refused enforce mask mandate got Covid campaigning re-election *Despite diagnosis, Pinal County sheriff says still plans wear mask public enforce future orders requiring one so.*  "" 🤦‍♂️ dense short danish?

We’re 11,000 people, Canada. think maybe 30 people keeping servers running manning help desk. Otherwise, employees forbidden visiting offices, except critical support.

As someone thread stated, landlords managed apartment complexes afford strict requirements tenants, stable income(and extension, also often equals savings) among these. Apartment complex managers much pressure fill single unit units well known.

OP saying saw letter show correspondence manager going take said leave.

Just allowed 2 weeks vacation mean take vacation without approval first. gotta figure lot 2 employees decided take unpaid leave. hearing 2 specific employees implies something different others took leave. Yup, I’m worried visiting mine see going family events. I’m like come on! Stop! educated population thinks much harder influence control though. charge would rather make cuts line pockets figure. lol fanboys leaving earth Goes show successful was... people starve instead money government support get food pay roof head?

Either way, sounds like poor communication management. Lol alright bro No, deaths rise usually go fake get where's proof/bodies inflated numbers stance. 

See Ny details. No.

I add “probably.”

But it’s implied.

Out touch billionaire like touch billionaire. Wow knew. Gotta celebrate small victories. Go go buddy. horrible analogy doesnt even contain similar variables play defense employer exploitation. know are. Everything describing exactly every EMPLOYER I've worked acts towards me. Expects best want pay deserve, expects risk life puts effort making changes protect health, expects job provide anything needed job effectively blames it. really employees entitled, people finally opening eyes shitty employers are, treat disposable also expecting remain loyal them.

edit:

A relationship employer employee mutual one, helping other. Nobody expecting job, we're expecting treated like human beings objects company used thrown start expecting something return. yeah fuck Weyland-Yutani I've heard Austin nurses many doctors/advanced practice providers taken pay cuts keep RN/LVN, staff, levels stable. see Texas finally stopping elective surgeries, least counties. anyone think anything else productive slow spread week? completely agree. reality tune one prevailing rhetoric prescribed us, less I’m tune surroundings deaths normal deaths counting virus deaths Gov't gets $ China...because china going reimburse us death?

LOL!

Probably like Mexico going reimburse us every mile border wall build...

Any day now.... NY. Here's Mississippi's latest case/death chart (from pandemic tracker numbers jumping around, trend line look good.  Progress doesn’t care respect.

What good something like it’s even going enforced? I’d honestly rather nothing. People going ignore it, minor outbreaks least bound spring it’ll give freedumb crowd fuel say failed/hoax control tactics whatever hell they’re trying claim. wonder even enough medical professionals staff impromptu positions. think there's lot truth there, also stuff left out. dont think NYC went nothing ""too late react.""

DeBlasio said NYC would shut down, people shouldnt concerned, even encouraged people hit town go movies even NYC first cases, people died WA CA.

I dont think fair expect perfect. people want try keeping score best, got acknowledge mistakes people made.

Well, useless. “All data I’ve seen”. ain’t seen shit. Google friend. States listen feds, think nothing else crisis taught us right?

Was Andrew Cuomo one point said would act War federal government attempted quarantine New York Metro region?

 think also lot states said POTUS authority tell open right?

 acknowledge point wholeheartedly, seems case Cuomo picking choosing edicts wants listen Fed.

Oh Trump Junior, Ron DeSantis, able go recommendation save lives Mr. Cuomo? willfully ignorant. family hosted big BBQ father’s day weekend included attendance 80-something year old diabetic grandfather recently surgery. 

it like pulling teeth disown coming, hope they’ll okay amount information enough them. journalists keep publishing stories like there’s real risk serious harm. least they're getting close herd immunity think understand objectively even means Roll Tide yall! unclear well

either way i've already called charleston council express support mask ordinance

this shit control downtown charleston. battery + east bay streets slammed tourists, zero protection. f&amp;b industry dropping like flies. northeast part US ok?

Tomorrow rest PA opens back except parts philadelphia, lebanon. seem flattened 300-500 cases per day falling months. think country general loves shit Florida lot wacky things happen (r/floridaman) mostly old people Northeast go die. kind like states New England make fun New Jersey, worse. We're talking Florida right? national numbers, yes, older people still getting infected go hospital more, way younger people ending hospital people think. People need stop focusing death rate. live, fubar virus die Scared though? progressive northerners scared teeny little virus

\s that’s probably they’ll think Wait kid? even remember that. point dad things? Unless mean peter Parker “Good news: I’ve figured new marketing campaign!” really, surge capacity projected filled two weeks, probably expand capacity. yeah quality care definitely affected. Enjoy bandana

But sad 500,000+ kids die every year malaria? many places like that, last job union stated hiring policy join workers union fired banned store. time didn’t get why, working almost 10 years seeing fucked shit happen realized didn’t let unionized people work there, it’s save money cut many corners safety possible bastard takes two episodes. used work 2 years ago still got friends now. say happens public completely different actually happens. I'm sure like factories Elon cunt. friends told got back Tesla forced come back upped production 500% instead normal 150 model day upped 500. many people calling cause amount stress pressure employees right keep hiring new employees slower employees who've working 12 hour days completely burnt out. Right also 85-90 degrees everyday workers getting pushed limit another good payday. I'm glad left cause crazy there. also like shit Reno here, perfectly fine standards :P Actually worst figure (of country population million far) 0.1%. say current US government could break record. benefits society monumental, know agree want lay anyone doesn’t / wants get perspective topic. benefits include everything less burden welfare, police, social services lower rates medical debt induced poverty, higher standard living economic activity financial stability individual macroeconomic level includes higher tax revenue help pay it, less burden efficiency entire healthcare system 1) several competing insurers working provide exact thing different company different rules creating nothing dead weight loss labor higher prices could spent efficiently economy, 2) healthier population afford preventative care requires less long term medical expenditure. 

Universal healthcare unfortunately include loss many people’s jobs short term, longer term societal benefits IMO far outweigh continuing status quo, one could reasonably argue universal healthcare necessity nature healthcare public good. 

There ways ease transition depending fast far wants taken. easiest least intrusive government creating plan within healthcare system, subsidizing it, increasing Medicare can’t afford it. Obamacare basically, considering much hate vitriol got says lot ready political right change status quo direction. let’s move past this. 

Another incorporating many working companies national system. could basically like companies went mergers form monopoly, instead monopoly pricing, they’d funded taxpayers offer heavily government subsidized pricing automatic coverage everyone. They’d get choose best workers effective structure trim fat system, offer job training / compensation rest. Everyone’s existing plans get transferred, prices benefits standardized, whole thing gets subsidized, transition happens months years. 

And that’s say private healthcare insurers would even want shut doors. Several countries private public healthcare, private offers certain benefits public not, it’s doesn’t complete industry collapse. thanos showed IRL

Don’t give 2020 anymore ideas! think looks fine. everyone wants something designed sport.

Edit: grew Japanese cars yeah, sometimes they're boxier, compact, etc. they're originally designed tiny streets. like that. makes feel comfortable sometimes driver. There's nothing wrong politicizing something requires political action. drum support force politicians job. Sahara Dust Cloud hit weekend? New Zealand lockdown restrictions right now. warning sign rioting Hong Kong toilet paper. could tell disease getting Wuhan getting control. stocked started wearing bandana store. Everyone thought crazy.

It doesn’t take much nowadays smarter POTUS. matter many times deny it... I've proved Tegnell's words.

""**this need get. control way**"" - Anders Tegnell speaking ""herd immunity"".

It's fact. denials meaningless. That’s bought Goop products beginning Washington state dealt first, heavily clustered elder care facilities broad spread like NYC metro area. California acted preemptively really spread far afaik. Greg Abbott intrinsically incapable learning lessons. We're boat third world country who's President also actively denies significance virus.

Meanwhile, bulk developed world took seriously starting beat it.

I wonder things connected all. thats trashy. grew randy weaver north idaho. masks protect us. protect whats right family every day. doubled Fox News still saying shit, lol. No, ""widespread closures""

Everything still open stayed open. Even schools. Trust me. goes around 10%, like northern italy must essential oils come edges flat earth True facts lol Nobody thinks it’s hoax 

We’re earning living getting paid 

You stay home. Labor Unions reason middle class America. Without them, would *Rich* *Poor*.  Wu-Tang Clan gonna take long, virus quickly getting control, distrust police, ppp money running out, unemployment getting cut evictions resuming.

I'd say September goes bad, hopefully.

But hey, stock market looks great right? 

Righttttt? I’ve working entire quarantine can’t afford hospitalization rate sars-cov-2 infections 1%. 

Out 1%, fraction need intensive care.

How end 10% ? article also says one e-mail dated termination notice given reassuring could go unpaid leave keep job. seems tried get give date he'd return, said either wanted call recorded done e-mail, they've ghosted him.

The employee said would return coronavirus gone. Watch animated movies. Justice league dark much similar talking about. Even darkseid knows Batman earths strongest mind. seems clear could learned lesson, not. I'm 100% anti-lockdown even think incredibly stupid idea. Surprise! Enjoy hospital bills. you’re saying need move Massachusetts? 12 days sounds like optimistic approach current daily number patients experiencing. people legal authority would Feds It’s Klan. trying ban Klan covering faces. 

The law needs updated, came good place. sub nutshell. Agreed. Again, think talking winners vs. losers point kind pointless. still far, far likely died covid NY resident FL resident. Maybe change, hard celebrate that. Tbh dont think winners pandemic US, different degrees losers. many pedophiles Joe Rogan hosted? ...cause Clarence parents real good marriage! Yeah mean media around politicized pandemic. Even ones got right politicizing process unavoidable. Politicization really huge problem. problem knowingly wrong sake politics that's R media/leadership issue. they've extremely reluctant right spite narrative they're invested in. People saying exactly months lol April took 3 weeks get father's death certificate.  additional reopening? Im texas couldnt open There's link analysis comprehensive tally states associated mask policies. mandates established last week many places already rise implication mandate resulted surge misleading. 

I think particular states cavalier attitude toward masks social distancing thereby increasing trasnmission rates. Businesses take measures protect employees customers enacting mask policies regardless state mandates, responsible sound business decision remain open.

Moral story wear damn mask. walked broken leg five days hoping really bad sprain. wasn't. hardly unique story, many friends similar ones. enforcing seatbelt laws either. texting driving. list go stop enforcing safety measures affect others lives mean, told going go away summer months 🤦  [""How hell gonna get fired day shelter place given time harness latent telekinetic powers, I'm down!

Then again, telekinesis, use ball all? Yep. go watch one YT vids twice week get refill.

That interview Jon Stewart awesome. Here's latest case/death chart Los Angeles, including 7-day running look good. maybe eventually it’ll “well number variants virus lower number deaths, means it’s pretty much run course.”

because.... logic. Put mask. Spray deodorant air 6 feet away you. smell it, mask work aerial particles like 0.3um virus. miracle, disappear! gonna die!!!!!!!!! us toppled 100000 primarily unhealthy 65yo dieing. Smoking kills 500000 people every year shit that. Yeah. I'm along 81 corridor. require work, unless I'm demanding wear properly, around necks. Wearing public never really 50%, probably even 25%. like said, cases lower. That's probably due social distancing. tell fallout great.

That’s weird he’s cited press conferences source. also disapproved since it’s Swedish. Thank you. I’ve removed post. record high death count it? That's pretty huge news need change system. Many, many Swedish officials prominent experts outright said herd immunity strategy. *actions* Swedish authorities line herd immunity strategy. Therefore, obvious herd immunity strategy. Jfc talk sensationalized headline, made sound like whole plant received terminations. I’m sure employees amongst 48k staff took “if feel uncomfortable don’t come in” DIDNT get fired, there’s probably reason two did. What’s “night light”? ""is media creating division"" LOL!! FINALLY someone asks real question. That's much interesting discussion-worthy couple people getting fired showing work.

Anyway, sorry things shitty. hope gets better. Arizona Texas going end like Italy New York City weeks? lot American unions pretty corrupt fwiw. want lower numbers, don’t we? one way get lower numbers. Or, stop testing. Time open mortuary. It'll thing making money on. biggest nerd disappointment since phantom menace...

Here's latest case/death chart Houston (harris company inherently anti-human, allowed exist humans....

It’s depressing can’t comfort really need right ever.  

We aunt pass away (unrelated) first hit son struggling even get home state funeral. get there, funeral essentially cancelled anyone outside immediate family.  

Compared one brother couple years hundreds people came out, it’s rough time family. can’t get physically close, can’t celebrate anything. Weddings &amp; funerals cancelled bare bones minimum.  

And even comes risk. us want able buy food without anxiety attack, let alone risk getting infected.  

Or birthday. We’ve two home alone, along mothers fathers days pretty much bust year. Nothing celebrate, even 4th July coming up, staying home.  

I’m sorry MIL, hope guys find another way connect. It’s going really hard while. Tesla good company reddit always Elon’s dick Reddit fickle. can't intelligent conversations instead crass displays humanist virtue? Texan here: hey gives?! Texas -- Texas Gov. Greg Abbott Thursday ordered hospitals state's largest metros to stop elective surgeries order save bed capacity COVID-19 patients. Hell even Reddit. used spam lot links infamous Swedish far-right sites. dumb ones least likely worry birth control future, unfortunately. sounds like question [Ask Freedom expression (non verbal) reason burning American flag legal Hot take Edison Tesla. Tesla super overrated. made good contributions, sure, accomplishments pale comparison Edison's. Also Tesla eugenicist.  Thats optimistic  using personal attacks accusing lying. 

The gist said sound good. fine want look someone. maybe read them. Elon Musks terribleness well documented long time. 

Pick someone actually good. sure hell want able make profits, think shitting Tesla company reporting profits really right thing do. re-invest shit ton money themselves, playing long game. Plus get pay less (or no) taxes. kind like Amazon either reported losses tiny profits long time. 

I think analyzing success Tesla company needs go waaay beyond looking profits... Let's say years ago invested Tesla, one happy camper right now. 

Here's deal them... electric cars likely future, things stand right now, company people look first Tesla. mean, else going look at? Porsche? Sure, got $150K sitting around. there's bunch shit boxes (to clear, Tesla shit boxy many regards themselves). Tesla wants remain dominant player market, keep investing themselves. don't, somebody else invest surpass them. 

All said, Elon douche. way tries make look like he's solving enormous equation every time gives answer damn funny. He's trying hard look like damn genius. there's also new found love libertarianism whatever... meh.

I fought 3 years local union president one 3 different companies.

Ridiculous. Youve held position lot longer americans like admit articles solely drive stock prices certain companies.. science behind social distancing sound. know fact works. That's advice always stay distant can't, use mask. Honestly I'm little pessimistic respiratory epidemics usually spike middle summer.

Texas actually closed phenomenally early 1st time largely spared recently. Unfortunately, led people underestimating COVID simply refusing distance/mask here.

tbf already happening theory, might work add imported cases visiting region case count, recovered count. That, people quarantined show symptoms, recover tests come back positive, added recovered graph. 

Currently, number suspected coronavirus cases yet tested twice number did. That's still likely true. article saying asymptomatic people contaminate surroundings, always assumed true. seems like never develop symptoms generally people spreading virus part. friends also threw surprise birthday party.

I imagine people likely unprotected sex unplanned pregnancies low IQ, uneducated, low conscientiousness extroverts good social skills high sex drive. excludes 90% reddit. That's conservative model. assumes continue \~700 deaths/day, despite obvious uptick cases reopening... Really? Many even wear masks get another lockdown. Would shit control everyone board wearing simple mask couple months. Nope, we'll prolong ruin whole entire year. sounds fun give shit publicly wearing mask, wearing mask. Division manipulation goal. Making novel virus political hilarious disturbing time. And, masks? Americans gullible. Hey, might well make vaccine political whenever arrives. Good times, People. That’s people interpret multiplying .01 100. 100 times less says take number now, multiply 100 subtract number used get number now.  say headline said infections two times less week.  100 week, two times less means 300 week ago. using math would 200 week ago since 200x 1/2= 100. Better say infections week half 1/3 1% last week. Thats fucking enough. need total shut down. bring military blast dumbasses breaking rules.

What mean that? way put pressure move elsewhere lockdown done properly long. shopping stores shop. Saw homedepot.open emergencies aka broken needed stuff whole families bored shopping masks distancing. true shorter lockdown lots testing contact tracing. Take peoples temps work school maybe even stores. contact tracing. Oh rights said next.. EO's power comes law. expires AUG 1. 

PA's governor well also people march capital (i think guns wanted throw 2nd amendment too). think pretty well controlled already instances see bunch people without masks (once coincidentally state house senate voted move ahead governor's moving green phase). part see people masks go grocery shopping.

Side note work Lebanon County county still yellow whole state. one guy works (who's closet r\*\*\*t non-party ) pissed governor still yellow push back retirement social security office still need remain closed. blames governor local politicians restaurants tried go ahead green phase instead following along. told expect people around follow along green protocol can't follow yellow? Hell, even follow Red. cars road going work red phase worked holiday expected every day red zone like driving work holiday. like people going told to, I'm sure happened. dont think US many deaths given point time... mean, know deadeumberth toll number gonna real (if already), way hell guys gonna say official number even near amount. ""ThE wAtAh StRuCtUrAl DaMaGe FyAh!"" effective South Carolina governor's ""Palmetto Pledge"" STICKER plans put restaurants VOLUNTARILY pledge adhere new restaurant employee ""safety"" protocols

while we're putting 1000+ cases day, 25% positive rate city, governor saying ""individual's responsibility need prevent spread,"" come fucking Holy shit see massive dust plume space! It’s big gulf Mexico cannot imagine putting much energy effort justifying way wearing mask simple thing. simple thing shows care people, need public. part Las Vegas isn’t even strip say anyway? wonder make covid skeptics Also time mask unavailability.

I’m day 98. said another post I'm sure Disney need funds coming in, I'm also sure laid employees parks/aren't paying right now. also comes heels releasing disney+ content outright they're paying fees anyone use content bringing (at last subscription count) least 6 billion year. Minus cost servers whatever technical magic need, lets generous say there's half billion tech costs run year. That's lot extra income that's basically free money them.

There masks, cleaning products, hand sanitizer, isopropyl alcohol.

Since then, let’s remember past 3 months - probably mostly May - able buy cloth masks mainstream retailers nationwide became thing. 

I think told us didn’t need simply none us wear. Domain apparently gone now. problem police unions exception. said done without doubt workers better unions, pretend otherwise fantasy.

This sides wrong, BS transparent deflection. flying anymore...
The rights corporations rich strong protections working man pathetic. Unions force people get fair shake. Enough nonsense  Yee haw!! 'Rona gonna get em! They'll sheltering place like inmates. used forever mean good tool. finally lockdown. Elections cancelled, safety. know many people **honestly** believe COVID-19 fucking hoax....more 180k surely die. “Fuck you, I’m eating” lot powers relevant lockdowns reserved states. sad going. I'm surprised though. want get back life well, I'm willing wait. feels like drag much longer misinformation, lack leadership levels, etc. I'm trying focus positives, can't. state finally starting (slowly) reopen going since March. Watching South others explode bringing back mixed emotions. can't even imagine essential workers, especially healthcare feel. I'm sorry many ignorant people leaders would rather pretend things fine economy save face votes. continue part though feels minimal point.

Yeah, pretty ironic seeing people crying dirty cops whatever want get trouble it, exactly managers factories put time. there's less sympathy they're greedy corporations something. ""Big outbreaks"" misinformaton. outbreaks small contained. Denmark around 20 active cases added today, one lowest % postitive test ratio whole word. 

It probably increase spread, already going back last days. Yes also wondered UK included got bad start, though recovered. also avoid birthday parties family reunions cough covid?

This sticking point. Even cough allergies, still spreads droplets. asymptomatic presymptomatic covid, spread it. doesn’t matter cause cough is. 

Dude party cough mask. Probably shouldn’t even mask. assume NYer going bad attitude, approach bias, you’ll get wish for.

You could try basing opinion merit individual geography. based color ones skin would called racism. Think it. MLB NBA cancelling jack shit, really think NFL matter? rye initial reopening phase, masks “recommended” provided casinos people entering. 

It worked ok couple weeks it’s falling fast people complying. That’s they’re upping requirement. 200k people (. 0006%) USA population going die October change nothing. nothing start estimated 2 million deaths. (.006% USA population) 

What saying half assed approach stop spread we’ve reduced estimated death count 90%? I’d say that’s pretty damn good actually. slacking: 8 days machine translate article? Yes plants

You don’t know you’re talking about. meat plants Amarillo, Lubbock. 

You’ve proven protesting caused spike. It’s likely massive reopening campaign resulted dead protesting. 

Protesters also given masks many folks wore masks. 

Btw, HIPPA rules don’t exclude information going public. excludes information identifiable. public made aware folks sick. NJ here, wearing mask makes sense...I cannot fathom ignorant simply dumb one must protest them...but they'll find out. Since takes 14 days see positive case, States starting popping last 3 days, 11 days unmitigated increases coming can't stop, weeks remaining level bend curve.


""Wear damn mask"" Moderna never brought treatment vaccine market before. either going SpaceX Pets.com.

Swedish life expectancy: 82.31 years 

This *is* significant difference yes. negative, yes. 

However, anyhting made Denmark vulnerable Sweden yet Sweden 5,000 deaths Denmark 600. 

Clearly Swedish life expectancy need readjusted downward year due mishandling coronvirus. may end lower Danish one. terrible tragedy, agree? Lmao, fucking mentality that? known “culling herd”. literally basing opinion solely click bait. keep going, carry on!

Mass making electric car something big money claimed impossible. Also, US way get astronauts to/from ISS, spacex pretty much saved day, promises get us rock species. Lets least give props employees two amazing companies.

I'm several actions make seem like he's abusing employees though. dare say anything coronavirus subreddit...this subreddit literally worships coronavirus going get downvoted stating facts. hope global warming. Also impending disaster, disaster progress.


And US gets economically rolled handling virus... World economy go huge US consumer base goes down. drink lot constantly infected immediately show symptoms thus know self-quarantine.

I this. Read bunch stuff Elon like hate TRUE tbh Seriously...Who EFF thinks sharing drinks pandemic good idea?! 

What wrong people?!?  mean electric cars objectively good environment 

Guy sounds like asshole comes business Tesla definitely leading charge popularizing electric cars. don’t think even debatable. dad poor show evidence masks work better that?On intuitive level doesn’t make sense masks work better contact all. evidence lockdown tracing works. country tried masks approach 

Also shut stores people quite quickly don’t haveto work. need supply way people provide livelihood. germany short work companies reduce hours government pays 60% missed wages people laid unemployment.  Never forget Elon Musk always huge piece shit Lol..been hearing 2 months... UV parties! Screw Tesla, Hybrid SUV another brand thinking getting Tesla year two. Forget now.

So, protect sure, eventually need consider financial realities what's going on. economy exists reason: keep world running. Urging isn’t going make employers okay employees staying home. Urging isn’t going make government step funds sustain people staying home. really don’t understand “wishful thinking” phase current Covid response. miss first part comment? Right. know there's something called ""Renewable Energy"" come sun?
Also, people power cars solar energy, get energy somewhere energy probably harnessed many different ways, including sun, water wind buy argument.

People using hyperbole since literally forever.

Unless trying argue events literally forever led us here. like trying say water wet. said distance best, can't distant wear mask. N95 best, followed surgical cloth.  strategy makes attempt stop spread virus.

Seriously first point going blatant lie, anyone bother rest post?

Heres information stop spread. Sweden whose approach worst Europe? Sweden? countries much better approach actually contained virus took research scientists used it. we? No, unlike you’re saying, sheep believe government people aren’t wearing masks. Donnie thinks don’t wear mask? People don’t wear them. He’s figurehead US government right now. argument falls apart think way, doesn’t it?  British person, something understand USA.

I've seen Reddit before, people arguing Unions bad. I'm glad see opinions changing, like brainwashed company's work for.

Unions Universal Healthcare good! let politicians rich companies convince otherwise. big difference 6 months live 5-10 years live. probably received offer dry spell coming university.

Pretty easy settle kind recruiting desperate. entire brand marketing.

I dont disagree anything said personality management style, straight bullshit. 

No one making mass market luxury electric vehicles everyone is. litterally moved entire market. 

No one providing private commercial flights LEO, dominates entire market.

He barely needs marketing companies unique selling points market themselves. Things may rough that's reason make sexist backstories even shitty people Check upswing. manager seriousness said attempted organize, company policy close entire location, layoff everyone worked there, open new one another city. said job boss's jobs would eliminated equally. even bother showing us anti-union videos. Alright mr Psychiatrist. wonder factory Germany going work It’s funny right sudden admires Sweden hahahaha can't fathom anyone brain would watch Fox news. 

Fucker Carlson might somewhat bearable high drugs everyone else cringe.

Full lies misinformation. painful.  usually normal. plenty guys criticize florida. might good idea guy 10X deaths attacking DeSantis. charts linked dashboard show ICU usage ventilator usage. ICU usage gone 40 COVID beds early June, 160 now. that's 120-patient increase three weeks.

STMC says 4200 \*total\* beds, I'd surprised ICU made much 10%-15% those. 120 new ICU patients huge fraction capacity. find hard believe they're normal ICU capacity -- unless they've kicking basically elective procedures free beds (which doing.) 10th amendment. ""The powers delegated United States Constitution, prohibited States, reserved States respectively, people.""

The government power unless given power federal state constitution. would depend individual state constitutions. No. work ICU plenty ventilators might pulled spring thought ass cause maybe brain assumed would point would start dont know. lol 
I hope everyone vaccinated point doe. Oh man, hadn’t thought it, would explain mask compliance too. got locked 3 months watched NYC Seattle take beating. masks mean get move around again, wear stupid mask. can't get N95 mask, would honestly double mask you. Bars hot spots covid especially cases rise several states. citation live extremely busy street hugely populated city. Probably 100 people walk window work every five minutes. Thousands people walk window day. enormous minority wear masks. want, I'll set webcam something see yourself.

I'm anti-masker. wear mask everywhere go appalled people anymore. I'm leaving house even less days result.

I can't tell like places tell reality like here. SoCal really good mask compliance beginning three months in, gone complete shit.

Hell, got covid tested drive facility day thousands cars testing staff even properly masked. Zero police masked. sent pictures county health department, anything come it. truth really excessive death. false positives false negative. Disputes reporting reporting.

Idiots. boils blood see people throwing parties like everything fine. Well, result. Hopefully none family members die. Everyone blame though, one attended gathering almost 20 people time. Boo hoo. Blame segment society temper tantrum pathetic basic requests.

This one least important consequences collective inaction. makes sense. That's strange since U.S one worse virus cases U.S healthcare system isnt best. heard one person reddit, two vaccines going Dr.fauci talking one. maybe that's confusion comes from.

Yeah, that's bullshit. looking NY? FL NY population, yet NY TEN TIMES number COVID deaths FL. TEN FUCKING TIMES, want say leadership FL one poor job?! they're idiots  can't stand man, think started Trump either young ignorant. What?? telling Elon people's billionaire?? thought cared likes memes cat girls

/s That’s rough! I’m sorry it’s going way family. sounds like family least good sense risk caution. You’ll stand much better chance getting together. 

I feel hopeful life Covid. stopped polio, rubella, mumps, etc. moment calls patience, right?

And good steak fourth... even eaten alone. Haha That’s works.   You’ve posted exact comment multiple times... &amp; doesn’t change garbage. First, don’t make sense &amp; misused data. Second, virus fact harmful working age population (20-60 y/o) 

Most importantly, you’ve missed entire point wearing mask: prevent virus spreading someone infected aren’t. Masks mostly contain virus: prevent giving others especially don’t know it. Masks help prevent catching virus stoping spread important reason. Already past number COVID Deaths. Nearing 250k point. don’t believe count number deaths normal average states numbers get really frightening. Politicians generally lie OH SOMEONE THINK ECONOMY also claimed would new cases end april 😂  exactly using word “panning”? “turning out”? think I've already told weird feeling cause Tesla dream car first heard Musk, enamored him, thinking kind real life Tony Stark. learn company pushes people, makes want try another brand electric car. Aw shit. Another total lie. claimed all. guess busy right since active sub. Either way, post meant stir fear, political war mongering, make NC (southern state) look stupid. It’s bad taste. Like me. Fml “Phases” ass, Abbott said needed cover shoddily reopen economy without pretext entirely giving up. two metrics reopening; decreasing case numbers decreasing hospitalizations.

They two things required new “phase” ever since beginning reopening exceeded surging **yet Abbott kept pushing reopening**

Rising cases hospitalizations? open bars! Spiking cases reaching record levels? fun amusement part 75% capacity limits! It’s fucking joke response Abbott consistently limited local communities cities implementing life saving mandates masks lockdowns functioning. Abbott literally overrode lockdown order city one biggest hotspots world. Fuck Abbott find several videos doctors saying pressured list cause death COVID. Also doctors saying listing heart attacks covid related it. heart attack Covid kill you. heart attack did...but deaths added totals. CDCs guidlines labeling corona COVID-19 reported death certificate decedents disease caused assumed causedor contributed death. ""

&amp;#x200B;

""ASSUMED CAUSED"" ...meaning flu like symptoms etc assume covid related label covid even without positive test.

A good article labeling Don’t allow USA, UK, Sweden, Brazil, Russia: Axis Incompetence. sort expected lockdown restrictions ease? percentage increasing that's high? Deaths remaining steady means treating better. Everyone likely going get point. hospitals overrun problem. bad, I'm sure expecting something different. Obviously many people social distancing wearing masks, increase always expected.  Throw hammer LA City lighter hammer throughout LA county move away epicenter. State government needs work make sure pain minimized among citizens. going impossible without help Federal government. you’re right. thought dad married step sister would insinuate made Elon weird.

Lol. comment makes laugh. 

Musk handling Covid should; based realistic evidence logic. fired two people. Two... you’re reading like killing baby seals. Unbelievable. 

Go buy Prius. buying Tesla devalues brand. Remind never emigrate US least give Switch? c-section March, doctor said long feel fine nothing looks wrong incision pass follow-up appointment week later. Fortunately, saw 6 weeks later healed fine. Haha took one little part context original comment used call people disgusting?

Wow, profound contribution conversation! You’re even dumber originally thought. WTF wrong you? arguing person value themselves, then, kinda do, they're irresponsible earn... zero evidence.

Do get douchebag? additional context added - fired position CEO. still use condom

um...you're generous... yeah really hate Musk variety reasons, like SpaceX Tesla employees treated, calling hero pedo etc.

but mean literally everything comes mouth wrong bad now. he's hardcore drugs (as clearly sometimes now), he's smart guy. Reddit white black everything. miss part employees confirmed allegations? Maybe got Elon’s dick mouth long enough actually read article you’d know that. virus attack white blood cells, bodies destroy tissue virus in. Many covid19 patients die self destruction process.

They found molecules creates self-destruction remove virus bodies, want lower kill patient. 

That prevent patient dies self-destructing lowering molecules help remove virus patient. provide four quotes politician telling truth

Nope. provide evidence saying truth... simply post saying declare truth.

The evidence Swedish strategy relying ""herd immunity"" extensive extremely compelling.

1. strategy makes attempt stop spread virus. fact, recently even trying track spread virus, people even tested unless seriously ill.
2. spread virus stopped, eventually infect enough people herd immunity becomes factor.
3. Swedish government constantly made predictions soon herd immunity would kick in, proving major part planning.
4. Swedish government explicitly stated *only* way stop virus herd immunity plan based ""fact"".

I care many times someone says something... clearly it, denials meaningless.

So, simple question able answer:

What ""end game"" ""slowing spread"", ""herd immunity"" it? expect epidemic end? nothing?

Looking outside, US fuck contain virus. NO!!!! Considering rallies states masks social distancing answer eLOn sMoKEd jOe rOgAn point many people would pissed vacation beach canceled fucking guys floor wonderful way company secrets leaked companies. That's one way dodging question. Wanna try another? Seriously, see Asian countries trouble wearing masks sheltering place... ""...they denial, denial life strategy.” 


Wisdom...its almost like ""Pro life"" GOP give fuck actual lives, controlling money, voting process womens bodies. It'll come vaccine timing. get vaccine year, Sweden's neighbors lock several months disaster. get vaccine year, appear Sweden sacrificed bunch people nothing. good site tracks hospitalizations?  Np! Thats capitalisims fault, type business. 

Only insane idea must producing 100% time problem world, idea must ALWAYS 10% better last quarter, meaning 40% better per year, meaning 3 years youre suppose 120% better 3 years ago..... meaning 10 years youre suppose 400% better started, meaning 20 years youre suppose 800% better started.. end? need always getting more, even price = death two week quarantine seems.

Even shut whole area matter point. average time onset symptoms hospital admission 7 days people admitted probably infected 10-14 days ago. going rise next couple weeks regardless do. Honestly, bot overzealous. I've comments removed normal conversations, e.g. discussing merits Elon Musks companies. Fwiw, I'm happy understanding situation challenged. worry, he'll tweet meme reddit revert right back Elon Musks collective Simp. trying another Steve Jobs. Jobs like that, reason worked people worked Steve became fiercely loyal him...though know why. accounts, Jobs total bastard...yet garnered respect people went way try please him. whole ""reality distortion field"" thing. 

Only now, people like Musk Elizabeth Holmes others think ""hey, worked him"". Only, total fluke. There's one Steve Jobs, he's gone. It’s like nightmare. Elon’s turned corporate wanker. He’s proved go furthest make penis look bigger everybody else’s histories sake. company forced make lay offs economic crisis choose 2 refused provide time table they'd willing return work.

Saharan Dust Storm slowing hurricane season.  won’t discuss health affects breathing sand though.... average number deaths per day last three weeks 25-30, that's bullshit.

Also, brags wearing masks highest rate new cases day Europe. Like, legit reading enough make remarks.  People go store, else starve death.  get infected there, even careful, others careful. 

People go work else homeless. get infected even careful, others careful.

I believe falling ""just world fallacy"", people instinct blame someone person got hurt. psychological protective mechanism make feel better fallacy, right thing ok. spent night Munich hauptbahnhauf. bit intoxicated Oktoberfest, able sleep next bunch mail sacks free. something consider. Basically developed nations shown proper measures massively slowed manageable levels, even without draconian measures China often took. problem though, people selfish right thing. understand people work lot people fine financially refuse stay try safe want make wackadoo political statement. 35% refuse stay take safety measure virus going keep spreading. musk supporters much like trumplets.

Anyways back hourly wage job filled people third wear masks. Freedom never felt good. sure viable would far away nearest large cities states are. Phoenix, specifically, close major city California, Nevada, Utah New Mexico terms transferring hospital patients. Love username. 

But setting conditions deliberately inflict death large scale isn’t genocide. Setting conditions sake inflicting death large scale would be. mean Walmart, company found intentionally hired elderly employees 80s 90s could take life insurance policies naming company beneficiary, tune tens hundreds thousands dollars pure profit per deceased employee, stopped sued state Florida 2000? think vague makes saying less political. Vagueness essential politics all. there's nothing wrong political. People conflating political wrong sake politics, latter problem. I'm trying figure meant ""they"" mentioned letting refugees Germany spread COVID19.

Are referring mechanical spread based increase number folks entering particular zone?

Or saying refugees particular higher infection rate result infect people particular zone?

Or ""they"" refer German government spread COVID19 result allowing refugees zone. 

And refer ""they"" referring to? 

The refugees German government. Human capital stock Big fuckin' yikes dude. course, going obvious reasons.

I meant he's essentially luring loyal supporters viral hotbox, especially considering group purposefully wearing masks. It’s repost it’s information shared Yeah, vows said. He’d previously supportive ambition, gave impression anyway. see that’s scary part, there’s still people supporting him. 
I get people loyal political party all, man, people still blindly support him?

Like Florida reopen Disney.  obvious years anyone gullible enough reddit cult can't wait posts huge increase US today.  necessarily. jobs stupidly prohibited staff wearing masks. Also, masks greatly reduce chance contracting it, still possible get wearing mask - like lot medical workers infected. 11 mostly Eastern European countries shown virus surges. trying say was”misinterpreted?” masks invincible barrier. mean huge impact statistics new infections. Even masks 50% effective would amazing job eliminate virus (if people actually wore them). think like 80% effective stopping transmission mask wearer, maybe 30% effective stopping transmission wearer -- guessing, take word it. N95 probably much effective expensive harder wear long time. different article, different website. repost Dude gold recipient.

Like entire post completely, perfectly unabashedly describes ENTIRE reaction shit right now.

We screwed.  source People die lack beds. Thanks stay home order people still get car accidents experience life threatening situations. Since ICU bed full happen people?

It’s horrible government less abandoning people die. friend came direct contact someone COVID positive, go work risk going homeless. Florida brain drain problem. know tons brilliant people, *born* florida, would NEVER EVER EVER live florida.

It's Florida consistently anti-intellectual cultivated mono-industry, tourism-based economy. called diversification, Florida considered cultivating stable landscape industry. source Costa Rica one country Latin America would expect best equipped handle also daily deaths going dramatically well

Major Texas cities suspend elective procedures funnel people make room now. yeah, buy low death numbers second. answer isn’t nick Hanauer wrong answer. three people, makeup on? click bait.  bonuses still enough bring income minimum wage. Unfortunately hitting cities harder. really. Proper masks even 100%. shitty cloth surgical masks everyone healthcare workers wearing even less effective proper PPE. percentages probability. someone's sick mean fault It’s okay north NV thinks LV “East-East Los Angeles” population basis that’s probably wrong...

Check state rules, think point cannot fire you. say check state rules ""at will"" states. thankful store Teamsters representing us, work state values unions.

Edit: grueling maybe dangerous worth end. possibly result death.

TAKE SERIOUSLY JESUS CHRIST death rate (which killed half million people least already?) Italy NY 30,000+ deaths good examples? mean person .... people shame everyone else ""pro-life"" yet exposing selfish liars care human life. refugees high rate infection?

Are statistics back prediction?

I'm conservative I'm illegal immigrants refugees country general. 

I got idea: temporarily legalize weed driving black, use resources help pandemic. I'm going start crying. Fr. WH looked American public, smirked, said ""thoughts prayers!

One couples know jobs stable. think high probability planned since recently got married desperate get started. young, kid could waited died down. Another couple know already 2 young children. again, don’t see point adding additional child pandemic going on. Two couples first children young planned pregnancy could delayed months year given fact state COVID rates increasing. personally don’t think it’s responsible purposefully child middle global pandemic. Sucks them, shouldn’t gotten addicted gov dollar. dug grave IMO. Let crumble. appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* guilty misinformation, yes, even CNN guilty downplaying beginning. real! episode detailing [the bastard wrote American police training eye-opener too. Hospitals still carrying elective surgeries? thought hospitals throughout US stop months ago. Rate spread point likely largely determined faithfully people masking. Know would improve speculation actionable information? 

Testing. article roller coaster vagueness.

Headline made sound like update TODAY, total beginning. Article clarifies, still reports big daily number.

But article says numbers back-dated necessarily new cases.

...but says increase may due testing. cousin college graduation party last weekend bridal shower wedding coming next 3 months. sister getting married September. aunt 4th July party next weekend. refuse go let son go celebrations don’t know people (I’ve store every week since March that’s it). People think I’m nuts don’t know they’re blasé whole situation. Elon turns out, dick. I'm dead *inside*. that? Southwest flies point point time unlikely adjust models grab share United flights. Chances flying Chicago MYR wanted take WN would already. 

Jetblue mostly regional NYC area. Jetblue flies NYC ORD daily shift planes around try capture turf United secondary seasonal vacation market.

Network planning huge part airline's operations simple ordering planes start moving tomorrow. Additional landing slots, contracts maintenance, fuel, catering, staffing etc. adjusted increased flights. Yeah, may inherited wealth, made shit load money using creating things sell himself. Sure he's huge ass, he's done really cool stuff. happen weeks people see lower deaths (compared April) continue make worse. work Vegas casino. I'd say I've seen 60% people wearing masks far today. Granted, security going around handing pretty much dead right now, there's rush guests seeking out. 

Also, still allowing smoking, pointless. Yes, Bezos' paper writing that, must true. know. publicly announce help factory workers. There's also union factory works, Tesla workers have. met (remaining) conservative? real reason lockdown, serious force law coming everyone companies would accept ""deadly plague"" reason come work would fire people left right refuse pay severance unemployment. previous spikes due prison outbreaks. relatively confined one space. probably largest increase outside massive prison testing back late April/early may. Except one surge fill manpower gap. Imagine that... racial differences pharmacology: 

""In recent review topic Ramamoorthy, et al (Clin Pharmacol Ther. 2015;97(3):263-273), authors stated approximately 20% new drugs approved past several years known racial/ethnic differences transplant: ""Although organs matched according race/ethnicity, people different races frequently match one another, individuals waiting organ transplant better chance receiving one large numbers donors racial/ethnic racial differences forensic anthropology, too. identify race looking skeletal features alone. 

IQ tests: need look results Minnesota Transracial Adoption Study see race indeed plays major part IQ; blacks adopted whites average IQ 92, mixed race adopted whites average IQ 99, whites adopted whites average IQ 105, relative differences consistent across ages.

Now mind you, modern science works hugely unscientific assumption race plays major part human body. imagine could actually study racial differences using modern science, science become new politically correct soapbox show world ""progressive"" one is, instead trying find truth. know!!! wear mask day work(grocery store) ya know what, completely bearable. many people collectively acting ignorant 4 year old kids. 
Like grow fuck deal mask time actually spending public like get take get home.

Edit... sorry rant want think I'm yelling you. people.... many ICE fires since? many electric car fires since?

171,500 highway fires occur across United States every year, unless half Tesla’s 2019 production burns every year probably aren’t flammable average car. want cite source claims otherwise, feel thread shows, there’s lot things say negatively Tesla without lying, also lot common lies bandied whenever Tesla comes - positive negative. cops? Nope, take responsibility. refuse mask many cases.

I watching Watchmen HBO last week. like, wow, [the cops really strict wearing universe, Trump Tulsa rally happening. I’m also holding breath vaccine many, many reasons. I’m hopeful... don’t expect see another year more. I’d love wrong. also know long-term effects vaccine well protects slight mutations virus constantly mutating. 99% mutations nothing make virus better worse, every awhile do, like current mutated strain impacted majority world, countries virus initially.

At point, 100% hope viable inexpensive treatment allows people heal quickly, reduces eliminates long-term problems virus creates, shortens low someone sick, dramatically reduces death rate. figured out, everything would change dime. insane./ people locked long period time, first thing probably parts world.


No. Source: parts world.    
I theory happens people stupid give damn, could wrong. Good idea, thank you! things life fun good you. 

willie nelson still alive. main issue, coupled pandemic. can’t say you’re online classes protect students say need put group students situations constant contact travel order make money   people understand nice people don’t get rich nice? can’t believe Spain allowing UK travellers.

This virus never going away. disease covid *doesnt* cause? Lets put together list spin good news. article says ""best"" stay socially distant. photo shows bunch packed together. 

Words fail me.  might devastate parts economy, it'll save lives. fair Western countries scared genital herpes, objectively speaking genital herpes infrequent generally mild skin irritation; it’s also extremely common, 1/5th 1/3rd Americans even realizing. Saying genital herpes anywhere near level HIV outright insanity.  add discussion carefully sourced well written posts notice massive unnecessary downvoting followed ridiculous attacks character.

So mind shitting throats commenters find disingenuous. 

Less need wallow mud us.

You good work, collecting reporting sequence events. No, mostly conservatives. Leftists know still sharing scientific data refining opinions Wait.. ICU beds, means u get serious car accident something, u cant go hospital??? wtf IOC delayed freakin Olympics year. really, really huge news-worthy thing. feel sorry hospital staff take care selfish jackasses.

Edit: Also, doubt oblivious idiots even realize assholes look like, probably 'cool news house'. Name internet now, too. Fuck 'em. fuckers ignored fact forced overtime years cool dislike Musk. Now, shit coronavirus suddenly dislike trendy. rumors. facts events occurred. Also people already wore mask whenever sick remember SARS. ""How U.S. Let Virus Win"" daily death count gone single digits past week. also countries went lockdown path reimpose them. Sweden still able stuff open wear masks well yes. biggest one Texas, Addison Kaboom Town fireworks-only, crowds on-site watch it. I'm curious going prevent people congregating outside site watch it. city canceled 4th celebration reason. Wondering sturdy field hospitals we're entering hurricane season. This. economy closely linked gambling industry (we don’t even lottery addition collecting income tax) casinos closed indefinitely kill economy. course, diversify economy takes time meanwhile casino workers need money state needs revenue. wish casinos could stay closed know that’s going happen. Plus, ripple effect. industry, we’re facing cuts result shut down. easy answers. Christ. 

I’m Mississippi, it’s coming.  Oh well, lunch break over, back selling essential shoes rich people 😬 going see lot exposed noses masks around necks.  2000 Americans dead today count. god. Mink used makeup brushes, eyelashes, I’m sure it’s used clothing, etc. It’s extremely hard site navigate.

The poster responding talking map NBC4i site, news site article posted on. That's official map, he's talking ODOH's map. I'm assuming referring latter, saying hard navigate? God mean virus? early cults based virus? Seems bit short sighted dramatically decreased spread next weeks. Otherwise empty beds available Lombardi situation hands. He's likely troll, really bored really dumb. post history would prime candidacy r/agedlikemilk. literally posts 3 years, suddenly popped going absolutely wild china_flu well. even normally things like 3 pages went single post outside sub something seemed off.

...meh sold stocks. Fuck Musk. I’d probably make killing keeping don’t feel comfortable investing bad actors. Right... states got hit they're urban... innovate. God dense. Welcome Reddit.

Every news channel fear pissing people off. Fox day boycotting Keurig Won’t someone think economy !!! Yea. Let’s give America Chinese freedom never hear about.

China, country origin pandemics, responsible this, better job. Same. keep car work. Got like 50 point. depends definition exploitation. Mine definitely job choose accept decline alongside contract detailing terms employment. 

I’m defending billionaires btw, things acquire wealth disgusts me. don’t think it’s fair put label genuinely good people e.g. Manoj Bhargava [Billions Change Documentary 

Exploiting third world countries separate issue belief workers exploited, difference lies fact don’t share belief. respect sure it’s view scenario. Yeah, unidentified upper respiratory viral infection February lingered weeks.  convinced COVID flu strep returned negative.  However, time doctors said zero chance corona.  took fact hadn’t arrived yet refused test it. pay everything? Well, really either. achieved whole lot, engineers worked half death reason weird personal martyr complex wants employees least imitate.

Personally think workaholic boss even worse lazy one. nothing address cause hospitalizations, though. lead furloughing hospital staff. would DeSantis handled things NY March? Would done better Cuomo? employee claim proof ongoing, current communication management. leave part out? first one handle it. Anyone can't improve first strategy office say ""humans,"" much ""Americans"" choice countries. half world taken much seriously us including China (which certain news outlets would like believe case). know right? Let’s really proud direct comparison third world country. need troubling times - ambiguity uncertainty look lead County statistics different national statistics. Yup. angry much easier self-evaluating. way avoid self-evaluating throughout life constantly angry. continue understand meaning behind “six nights overnight”. seems like based nothing. replaced CEO means got fired. don’t talk shit people cutting check.  needs left deal, clear danger others.  yes, die inability breathe panik atacks heart seizures. pls die Covid. Someone isn’t fan Apple Apples comparisons - DeSantis months prepare this. 

Obviously, NYC one hardest hit gate population density, world travel simply didn’t know much virus know.

- mentioning multiple rumblings DeSantis pushed fudge numbers beginning

- Also mentioning beginning Florida Elon Musk anything Nikola Tesla represented,he Thomas Edison generation(businessman first inventor later) Wow, angry man invent infractions post thread. 

He must something right then. That’s sounded like marketing material. old filter filter similar rates, that’s what’s work. point particle filtered doesn’t really matter whether positive ions destroy since never got body begin with. would provide additional protection touching mask. said, Reno lot nicer 2020 2010 Right. sucks, really does. moved cross country know mom (had breast cancer last year, chemo, whole 9 yards) really looking forward coming seeing new place. much contemplating last month told risky us travel. 

This story tragic honestly people need understand virus dangerous precisely may immediate apparent. can't start 15-20 people get togethers homes. certainly older / compromised folks going involved. Frankly could seen mile family knowingly chose get whole group together knowing likely still working amongst people. Lol Personally, think well. communicated daily, kept date emerging science, toed line Trump quid pro quo. forget--at time Italy China explosions Covid like NY faced, guidelines CDC kept changing. mention FEMA stealing PPE. Trump sending Navy medical ship many restrictions impossible use. Oh sending tent hospital staffed anti-LGBTQ-ers. 
Considering obstacles faced, miracle NY lose even people did. Burn get concern, reality fair. leaders MIA, nearly matters serious concern nation.

Gates using philanthropy get richer, much does, mostly wealth first place came ruthless business practices unethical behaviour. bought companies ran ground get rid competitors. ruined lot families 90s. want ignore past mistakes favour present good deeds, there's still taxes complain about. Donating millions, billions, getting paying taxes way ethical even perfectly legal. there's counter that, ""He spends money efficiently government does"", agree means tax-exempt. Taxes agreed upon way contribute society part of, dodge favour donations charity acting good faith. That's possibly result engineering mindset though

Whoever dies irrelevant. needlessly condemned thousands care home residents early deaths horrible hospitalization release policies protocols. listen voted 16, drank kool aid, get it. want fake. can't real. is. idiots still support detrimental society Let know spot faults I'll correct them. think tweet puts well: thinking yesterday: seems like takes end football season \*one player\* get severely ill (as in, needing ICU care) COVID-19. Yes, % healthy \~20-year-olds get sick low. LOT college football players.  recent study said \~0.3% healthy 20-year-olds w/ confirmed COVID need ICU care. Let's say that's 0.1% testing. \~70,000 college football players. Let's say 10% catch COVID, seems conservative. That's 7,000 players. 0.1% 7,000 7.  lower 0.1%. maybe 5% players catch COVID. again, maybe 30% do. exact numbers wildly uncertain. But, first approximation, **it strikes fairly likely least 1 player ends ICU COVID, think ends season**  really think Elon Musk office saying, ""I want fire Bob Amanda scared Coronies, nyeehhahah.""?

While think happened, reminder casually accused someone pedophile unhappy. relevant, called pandemic ""dumb"" early part ""free America"" agenda. Mentioned article btw.

So although think situation hypothesised would indeed rather ridiculous, say I'd awfully surprised something like actually happens. Lol!

Usually one strain virus take become dominant infection. exception princess cruise infections, strains Washington, Europe, China coalescing northern California. issue. shit spreading, fast. 

Wear mask. Wash hands. Stay inside. That's selfish sentiment, frankly think lot denial bargaining taking place. map lot bizarre responses feelings onto statges grief (grieving loss old lives realizing much took LACK pandemic granted). 

There still far doctors DEEPLY CONCERNED doctors hand-waving away. close family friends' extended network (of non-epidemiologists, even pathologists FFS) anecdote, might dismayed learn ""no interest politics"" actually really harmful political attitude given pass. Apathy part got us here.

I ton friends MDs currently residents, several snazzy spots like Johns Hopkins, Harvard Stanford. say bad, MUST take seriously. also know least one doctor attitude report. cases, doctors dead COVID, cases doctors DONT work Emergency Medicine, DONT work pathology, DONT work Primary care practices actually salty LOSS work income non-urgent medicine fields facing (layoffs loss work/revenue happening, elective surgeries suspended. makes SALTY boob job doctors.) 

Of course people financially harmed claim bad. Oh still hoax them. Fake... need extra chromie believe Wow! that’s thing endure. 

And agree.. see people age died (42, super young ancient), try keep mind comorbidity likely work there. 38 year old stairs neighbor stroke.. watched carry McDonalds every day work. 🤷‍♀️

I’ve never met type 1 diabetic didn’t shit together. otherwise healthy people I’ve known. charitable claimed government nothing combat child poverty therefore tragic majblommans sales down. No, honestly misread comment. chunk population give shit practice guidelines around social distancing wearing masks can't distance inside business.

Driving bar Austin seeing look like Pandemic never happened good indicator whats come unfortunately. Welp time prepare months lock down. 🏅  people fucking nuts. joined Facebook group see saying. 

They actively refuse mask wearing don’t believe virus. 

These people threat.

Edit: I’ve linked wild ass Facebook page stand corrected. both, cus potential voters ones hoax NYT absolute best data viz i've ever seen topic ever. They've pure gold since start pandemic. NY state likly much worse due lack testing early. also sure possible get NY levels places due lack transit. vaccine trials coordinated NIH, they’re trustworthy. Can’t say anything CDC days NIH upstanding biomedical institution. performance piece, right? 

Aside labor law, employee rights, etc, shit spewing forth literally opposite employer best practices are. motivate people beating them, /u/supertimes4u citation live extremely busy street hugely populated city.

LMAO. citation anecdote. Got it. NY cases deaths state far... incredible? Yeah, lockdown 2.0 coming. surprised now. past weeks I've gone dentist, oral surgeon, back work, ER lobby, urgent care, regular medical office. legitimate non-COVID reasons life pause year fucking sucks. 

So need study ass. wish Germany would let thousands ""refugees"" definitely spread care anything. I'm Fox news reader/viewer clicking link see first item Navbar ""Coronavirus."" 2nd topic listed Hot Topics Coronavirus several articles without needing scroll all. people need sign something giving treatment. everyone else pay asshole spreaders. Listen know shouldn’t hope specific people sick die

But... 🤞 govt current environment referring covid. Although covid major contributor. cherry picking data make point. include causes, would less impactful. COVID interesting starts zero ramps within timeframe. Imagine replacing fauci’s name trump. friend Goddamit friends like this??? (looking comments). Mine nurse. goddamn nurse occupations.

No wonder US fucked. Well less deaths per million countries Europe locked id say went okay. social media, people learn feel sound ""intellectual"" using word, pretty pathetic. state exploding new cases course.

Apparently feds stockpiling ventilators releasing hospitals.  doubt, one literally protest wearing masks, ridiculous reason. gathered Dana Point chanting without masks on. Also, rest New York state get hit hard city, able shift care upstate. I'm sure rest Texas faring able help Houston. I've answered previously, outliers prior self-isolation corrected whereas Fox, Trump lockstep, downplaying beginning leading 10s thousands unnecessary deaths. New Zealand handled well, also relevant comparison. “Young, healthy people need working keeping economy going flu hoax cure can’t worse disease! Open everything gut pandemic unemployment assistance!”

“Okay, well need go work able live. months you’ve saying overreaction political, I’m going go back before. wasn’t safe, wouldn’t reopening.”

“These young people getting sick! reach them! think they’re invulnerable!” 9/11 happened every day 2001, would “only” 1.1 million deaths. Well could argued Sweden trying pull Ischgl? keeping lot sick people, inviting enerybody come visit them. fuck end like this?

Like world's nukes blow planet gets sucked black hole shit like instead slow, agonizing, terrifying way possible? Fuckkkkkk woman 20's otherwise healthy contracting Covid-19 required double lung transplant.

Warning: picture one lungs removed LOL 

You're talkin millions people need self quarantine get tested. 

We can't even handle testing ""for"" many people lmao. 

Who told them?

EDIT: added ""for"" one gets removed. rigged election tolerate anywhere else world, wide ranging denunciations across globe people latch onto anti-American talking point merely guy rigged elections anti-American. Like order troops fire protesters try replace officers Cuban officers (and whole time remember, military's that's left police abandoned ordering fire protesters), think going happen. coup merely military said ""yeah, shooting people exactly good move, leave"" Yeah... India fkked bad .. old uppercaste fogeys messed horribly 5.8% New Zealand's GDP tourism. that, 60% domestic 40% international. ""Relies."" except that's works? never refuted claim. Go read up.

Ideally people would wear mask. think around 24 hours since last statement saying things fine Snort it! meant Nissan Leaf song change hits pockets, boy change fast. parroted redditism comments fucking worthless dumb. well people following shutdown safe practices?

And tight shutdown?

One reasons southern United states poorly people ignored safe practices even tepid shutdown, course, opening early exacerbated everything. Surprise! detox drinking much. thats left mind.....jesus......im already ready go....ive enough.

I'm week two drinking, quarantine binge. got this! No. religious behavior. Ignore disagree with. blame religion. much dislike Elon much people shower praise, isn’t *stealing ideas*. 

Any entrepreneur knows it’s possible *steal* idea multi-billion dollar company. Hundreds companies tried everything Elon did, he’s one succeeded most. execution makes Elon impressive.

He sets goals high able get closer reality anyone else has.

No shit, “e-transactions,” “gas-less cars”, “colonizing moon” aren’t original ideas.

Hey thought ending poverty first, anyone stealing idea. Yeah glad see here, wondering suddenly reached 2000+ US. position completely lacks nuance. I’m currently working manager abusive bully. manager hired 18 months ago left, replaced absolutely bridge troll woman. Everybody else department miserable, they’re age 55. told refuse say anything HR they, due age, difficulty finding new jobs get fired speaking out. I’m person team willing speak up. What’s reward?

I'm operating position 'when someone tells are, believe them.'

In case, group dehumantized part population turned wearing mask political issue. Far I'm concerned, due sheer joy inflicting death 'enemy'. ""In beginning"" data became available, changed messaging. Unlike conservatives. old trope Florida, south go, north get. understand mean country, case southernmost counties state.  felt way read this. agree, % tested infected best metric, yet nobody uses it, why?

**Headline: Full it, Taken TACO.** Tons cases there, NJ’s testing atrocious early missed many cases. got 50% positivity rates first month testing.

Gösta Andersson, 81, going receive intensive care cared covid-19. children appealed, decision changed - training 33rd Vätternrunda [ [a long cycling event]( ].

Södertälje Hospital reports case according Lex Maria.
 

One elderly people prioritized away [triaged] care pandemic, [DN reported Gösta Andersson, 81. 

He trained 33rd Vätternrunda, became seriously ill covid-19 April, ""zeroed out"" doctors Södertälje Hospital - would receive cardiopulmonary resuscitation intensive care. children appealed, got place ICU all, healthy.

Neighboring Gösta Andersson lives retired doctor read Gösta's case. heard helped make complaint malpractice hospital Inspection Health Care, IVO.

- thanks children taken care managed live, otherwise would simply deleted. view treated arbitrarily brought zeroed me, tells DN.

Now hospital also made notification, according Lex Maria Ivo. That's Gösta Andersson happy about.

- illness done little benefit. great investigated, start follow routines. departed routines, routines wrong. must go age assessments, look whole. long room intensive care unit, prioritized away, even though passed 80. example able manage even though 80.


Christophe Pedroletti, CEO Södertälje Hospital, reports DN already previously decided investigate handling Gösta internally. Normally, decide possible Lex Maria notification Ivo, case choose report Ivo parallel directly, partly already reported Ivo.

- Regardless event analysis turns out, also think hospital issue important want external independent review investigation.

According Christophe Pedroletti , Södertälje Hospital, like others region, scaled operations enormously. 

- margins system terms site availability, careful routines decisions usual ethical medical principles care patients apply even pandemic.

- indication case, would like review internal investigation. Since issue also National Board Health, Ivo media one prioritize ways pandemic, also want examined externally acted.

Södertälje Hospital Lex Maria reports 81-year-old Gösta Andersson prioritized away intensive care, despite fact vacancies.

As DN stated, doctors criticized regional management denying tougher priorities usual occurred care pandemic.

Torbjörn Tännsjö, professor emeritus practical philosophy Stockholm University, believes great risks speaking clear language priorities implemented.

- risk doctors forced make priorities, higher authorities want let on. end usually called ethical stress, also legal gray zone, run risk subsequently held accountable done best sense word.

According Tännsjö, difficult current situation find regulations, among things based Health Care Act, believes contradictions. 

- However, soon catch breath think clearly, deal task. fucked last month gorgeous time year everyone wants sit patio. miserable time year porches hot AF everybody wants AC. gonna get worse! Musk didn’t found company. bought it, title “founder” two guys Lol household countertop harbour active viruses days time (depending type) make food stuff packaging different? Real life 10 percent people state wearing masks. weeks ago 30 40 everybody decided covid over. nobody wearing them. fewer people social distancing. virus marginally deadly bad seasonal flu Pay millions extra 600$ top making obsurd. 90% called ""unemployed"" young kids 20s making 900 week TAXES!!! I'm sorry insane adjusted. People blowing money, saving, blowing fireworks night. Seriously going wasteland extra 600 ends. I've never life made 900 week. abomination. that's ok sit ass I'll go work making $550 week taxes risking ass high traffic areas every. Single. Day. I’m interested that. Illinois believe law kids start age 5. 33 weeks pregnant live FL appointments. asked dr could appointments virtually wanted come in. Again, prove people defying order? Slapping anklet everyone coming states?  wouldn’t know. What’s like live perpetual fear? guess Trump’s sharing cure people safeguard life lives children grandchildren. really believe individuals places share types freedoms Americans do? American individualism unique philosophy. country earth values individual highly society whole. spend time living abroad find completely foreign idea. rest world views interests society superseding individual. us dissents view, country so. lets shut everything gonna die!!!!! Um, there's problems article.

One things swath dust makes harder hurricanes form. point time, weigh worse - dust cloud give issues lung issues, fucking hurricane knock power, throw everything whack, importantly, put pressure hospitals already now.

This would really minor inconvenience anything else. There's lot people aware COVID-19 body they'll probably mask stay indoors part.

Please use NBC News. obsession clickbait, fear mongering articles. think still people left wear seatbelts tbh says big gatherings South LA home. believes took one two family members stopping by.   takes conversation, breathing person’s direction--that’s one thing wanted share,"" said. ""It's real. wear mask. carry mask. wear it!""   says he’s sharing family’s heartbreak prevent others going pain.  
    guys need find hearts know real situation,"" Richard said. ""This real pandemic - virus real.""   added, ""I’m real person. father real person. Yeah going hard everyone, northeast let turn too. shutdowns prevented/delayed arrival south. believed virus instead overconfident saying ""it might happen here"" could careful done testing. low case numbers 3 MONTH HEAD START could done testing, contact tracing, marketing regarding masks reopening. could kept eye numbers testing population batches, looking virus sewage system, new York, Louisiana, Michigan, Chicago burning. instead got tied shutdown went ahead opening. thought blu stait problem decided ignore it.

Overconfidence. Dunning Krueger effect. 

When saw China build hospital 8 days shocked. saw people fainting Tehran confused. saw Italian doctors beg us GET READY realized different Chinese, different Persians, definitely different Italians. risk need prepare. 

But Texas Florida decided happen hoks. looked around neighborhood recruiting looked normal blamed media. media fake hospital built. media fake Italian doctors crying coworkers intubated. **Just media also sensationalizes mean there's satellite image category 5 hurricane must fake news.** cultural political issue caused leaders choose people die stupidly, many MANY warnings. Bodies street Ecuador. Mass graves see space Iran! fayk news? Imbeciles.  first plateau unemployment. soon PPP runs going see massive surge, wave major corporate (e.g. Airlines) bailouts conditions keeping everyone September. CDC wrong? happened trusting experts?

.26 percent death rate. Even lower people 60. Keep fear mongering. violate ADA HIPPA Show me. Show human innate immune system flawed Exactly listen government ALWAYS best interests heart questioning anything say dangerous know mean, confusing.

A load experts know sort thing keep saying things take time absolute best case scenario we'll vaccine next year. random journalists say could vaccine year mate Dave pub says there's already vaccine they're keeping secret.

I literally know believe. what's called ""trickle truth"". Originally officials denied triage happened all, refraim always ""ICU capacity maintained!"" [several high profile doctors come strong calling **lie** tune changing. admit [""active (as one high profile doctor called it) occurred. ever do. Disney pretty fantastic handling public image feel (scientifically) opening lead headlines like “people go Disney get sick”, definitely postpone. live close enough WDW hear fireworks night. really weird shut missed fireworks :( even know tried contact tracing Japan? verbally asking people remembered contact people. That's it. Bullshit that's thing brought virus, sure, 3Cs contributed substantially, masks made 3Cs able make significant impact lowering n 1. Oh sure, think wide confidence interval honest little knew time. fact we're upper bound 95% CI first wave infections even close contained suggests either extremely unlucky, fundamental problems model. think second point hits mark. model may accurate conditions reasonable public health response countries. think model may fallen assuming response US. April, abundantly clear US going completely screw coronavirus response. already harmed themselves, nothing it. fact, wish would stayed away one would’ve harmed. 

Sad remind you, pandemic country past four months. seem think love protects neighbors infection, NOT. 

We see assholes are. SYMPATHY SELFISH PRICKS. you’re fussing Facebook, hopefully you’ll someday give Facebook like smoking. It’s toxic there!

While Reddit also toxic, really great subReddits. Check favorite pasttimes I’m sure there’s subReddit it... may even multiple subReddits LOL CO2 exhaled anti-maskers fear. 
But CO2 poisoning cloth masks enforced bus terminals airports, mentioned article. try defy fines steep. Yes, said article. even imagine walking surprise party right now? I’d turn right around walk lol. 

We’ve whole drive parade parties kids. love it, it’s 15minutes 10x cheaper throwing typical kid party. it’s disappearing like president says. Round 2 spending couple years California (I'm UK), moved Portugal. first thing struck supposed poorer EU country *nobody afraid*. one. servers store, people take bus clean streets, waiters waitresses. Even (very few) homeless people afraid.

**The first freedom freedom fear**. even US. I'm going go say good bye parents weekend. wearing masks whole time sit outside. told feel comfortable seeing :( I'm threatening violence advocating it, history tells us heads. need proofread comment right. 

Dr. Paul Offit, University Pennsylvania pediatrician developed vaccine rotavirus: ""At point, Oxford researchers idea whether something not. get tired 'science press release.""

Schaffner, longtime adviser US Centers Disease Control Prevention: ""We usually see public pronouncements. We've grumpy national political leaders providing inaccurate information, hold scientific leaders standards.""

Me: ""pump brakes. There's nearly enough data imply we'll vaccine proven efficacy fall.""

You: ""but he's study.

*Him study proves nothing whatsoever. study see vaccine works safe. know answer either yet.* SURPRISE 🎉🤮 can. Many feel Unions parasites getting rich labor getting money getting nothing Unions due years seeing exactly happening Unions around country. panic ensue everyone run exit. Muh Freedumb! kids school literally provided Chromebook type (cheap usable) tablets internet families afford them. 

Not sure poorest districts afford there's savings online (or mostly online) model. might still need offer person classes need that. Know I'd still argue individual nearly free think. definitely moreso free countries. first world countries free societies. Italy said average 8 days hospitization death. LMAO deniers saying scientific papers studies favor masks peer reviewed unscientific months now. don’t feel badly slightest stories like often wonder says me. Thanks, is. love US, supposed fly Miami tomorrow wife kids 4-week vacation. Much love visit (3 times last year) way would live there. Stay safe dude. Newsom also gets credit going CMS recommendations...which led ton extra cases deaths nursing homes. saint. Unfortunately many, difference state numbers needs reach exaggerated point amount denial deflecting justified. left pick pieces learn painful lesson masks work.

Sickness disease political, affects humans. wear damn mask? Thought guys finally distinguished Alabama, nope. hilarious rappity rap song opens ""My name Redfield I'm say...""

works every time!  agree. know Murphy perfect, think handled certain things pretty well. Can't please everyone. least feel reassured stay top rather pretend vanished. worst pandemic human history one important saying that. source anyone importance politician making claim please respond I'd love see that. there’s many, many elderly who’ve recovered fine media chooses report recoveries advised would send wrong message.

What talking about? I've seen many news stories old people surviving.

And media showing survival statistics statistics show every old person dies virus. Anyone thinks many elderly people recovered beyond stupid. 

Not sure making stuff regard. I'll take word   covid death rate 0.5% right? that's 2 million deaths. rest us 298 million people still left

to deal lung issues foreseeable future. I'm full mask everywhere go except I'm sexing wife. part, LA definitely something wrong politicizing refusal something, politicians claiming hoax, precautions ""attack freedoms"", forth actively hurts effort contain pandemic. got people killed could saved. girlfriend thought entire thing overblown best friend best friends' sister got it. mask-everywhere person. frustrating. that's fine. people scared go outside 100% right so. government mandated shutdown something see feasible point. want let off, also want let individual off! good coach takes blame, good player blames too! People keep blasting 70% herd immunity stastical attempt finding number mathematically works never pans way. H1N1 40%, Spanish Flu, around 33%. know people believe magically number 70% fact that's one perfect scenario. many things change herd immunity vary area area. possible NYC see much wave fall since likely around 30% plants crave. Please hurry die. draining social security fast.

There fixed you. started tweeting covid stopped Elon fangirl. apparent, watching activity Twitter, interested science came COVID-19. 


I truly admire work teams accomplished, smart he's made seem. absolute asshole whole thing, probably asshole along. Arent cases leveling bit? This! someone tell read news online virus serious. asked link said find it. told check history said computer allow it. LIKE WHAT.  TikTok annoying. wear mask now, I'll opposite whatever say. CDC dumb Ok. ppl need stop blowing fireworks. Whatever case may be, ICUs filling bc COVID19. They’re going herd immunity, means 20,000,000 cases Texas - 100,000 200,000 dead state hospital care.

That's effective herd immunity works getting percentages aiming for. Sweden went route, tanked economy, fucked relations neighboring countries still came well 40% hoping now.

For talk saving economy opening back up, robust think that's going death rate we're going get? think kill One Lubbock's worth Texans, going put severe damper eager people get back shop attend football games.  Infection hard prevent hospital happens lot, also surgical masks changed periodically surgery even moisture breath makes less effective.

They really designed worn hours time, help somewhat situations puts extra cost businesses, inevitably make harder small local businesses return profitability. Makes sense since he's business owner Kind odd time new contingency plan So, totally understand you’re saying...but think totally understand saying too. daily cases far reported tomorrow, hits next daily high (probably next day), peak.  NY's population NYC much dense Florida, 10x dense Florida's populous city. also much larger hub domestic international travel JFK LGA miles apart. New York also one earliest cities hit pandemic, STILL able control situation month start getting numbers trend down. Meanwhile, Florida anything, leaders unwilling even require people wear masks.

New York heroic job face incredible challenges. Florida almost nothing ample warning precedent (including opening amusement parks soon hosting national convention). going tragedy. Citation? two weeks old now, last poll saw said Newsom's coronavirus handling 69% support within California. that's well within reopening phase. showing profit, however, mean successful company. profit something happens run investment ideas. growth better metric, assuming substantiated. Well, saying Donald Trump self-made, next going tell Matt Gaetz, Nancy Pelosi, Andrew Cuomo, Beto O'Rourke, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Rand Paul self-made. is? one, that's who. people owe success one, hard work grit. People entitled days. much I've read pertains anti-WHO sentiment reddit last number months, particularly issues surrounding Taiwan, flat wrong. much politicized, particularly Taiwan USA. 

I seen well. Everytime read something like tend remind reddit information platform leads biased thinking. much guess...  Hot tip: sort controversial. Here's found top pile you:  sad. Remember New Jersey family lost mother three adult children week Covid? scenario. Isn‘t pretty much everything aside large events open again? What‘s gonna halt? weird thing requiring masks barely anyone wearing them. know people cautious still really makes wonder much food response luck. Both. There's something called single cause fallacy always good keep mind thinking things like pandemic handling. willfully intransigent people people behave recklessly reprehensibly . confluence two reinforcing system bad behavior. HOWEVER, nothing binary situations like these, government made really bad decision telling peple wear masks work order try prevent PPE hoarding. catastrophically stupid transparent why, destroyed credibility among lot people. again, people can't afford financially.

Don't forget many governors made news circuit talking bad head state spent weeks telling everyone fake. I've actually met people believe it, even told aunt likely died two weeks ago, got swine flu hospital 2009, two great grandparents died influenza epidemic back when, epidemics real. change subject.

Tell people wear masks hoax believe you. 100% fault people refuse ideology seen people calling poison control centers ingesting I'm Cleveland Lorain well, electronics place business less 50% people wearing masks 15% people needing point joke  brave ignore class solidarity, common sense health concerns, defend multi-millionnaire. 

Seriously, amazing person. Great job contrarian genius /s stuff job doing. There's tons people wear masks either. take seriously someone know got it. Mine started slight cough. lasted weeks felt super crappy entire time. case ""mild"" kept thinking got worse could easily kill me. shit joke. ours, people actually go event site. drive locations good view it, watch fireworks, leave. problem places still packed. That's happened Blue Angels flew over. like opposite Legend. one stars Paul brothers. Wolksvagen think video broadcast it’s happening undisclosed site middle nowhere. least that’s read couple days ago. Yes. capitalization Soon really ties joke together. broke testing record, talking about? Thats exactly nobody wants open borders AFAIK govt still travel warning place. fucking happened me? came home running errands putting things away immediately start breathing heavy catch breath felt like would vomit seconds. Now, think taste anything. Ive tried pineapple, salt vinegar chips, soda, etc... sense vinegar slightly, pineapple sour even though fresh, soda tasted like foam bubbles. still smell though idk whats going on. made scheduled test im kinda freaking now. 

I took shot vodka taste fruit punch gatorade chaser. thought id try something stronger soda drink calm little. think im worried. gotta wait scheduled test stay till mean, it’s like mandatory quarantine way enforceable Well, lead German news site's interview Sweden's foreign minister wow, that's heavy denial defensive replies got. interesting. quite needy impolite... Go away Uninsured enrolled Medicaid paid government Medicaid rates. Local hospitals furlough staff run specialist clinics outpatient surgery. admit many people much get away with. would abused fast power, cant make unpopular opinion illegal.

We educate americans see shit. Watching stuff make laugh. nod agreement. Dude, read comments. Next Lombardy + Hurricane Season + Dust Storm + Aliens. fucking pathetic. Well - that, fact even ""locked down"" people continue frequent people, i.e. family members. going take at-capacity hospital system MONTHS clear COVID - 5-14 days.

This people seem realize. ""Locking down"" accounts nonessential trips-to-the-store, nonessential business aspects. remains seen much spreading factor activities COVID-19.

What happens lock down, period three weeks people *maybe* go screw around TJMaxx three hours (but still continue visit grandma, pick meds, make dinner three times week sister take gossip they're it, generally continue normal). literally morgue-semis trucking past windows corpses stacked like sardines, MULTIPLE local news stations giving ""inside glimpses"" LOCAL ERs trolleys full coding COVID+, thought even ENTERS mind ""gee, maybe I'd better go see aunt Mary weekend change"". Seriously.

And get loooong, dragging slow plateau excruciatingly slow descent peak.

Source: Watched New York. Monkey paw merger. early estimates 10-20 actual cases case I’ve always thought 10 accurate number, NY antibody tests confirmed it. Puts IFR .9 - probably high side nursing home infections.

I guess days would 6-8 cases confirmed case due increase US testing capacity - still puts us 200,000 - 300,000 cases day 1.5 million walking around infected contagious. Yes we're talking national numbers, likely indicative actual demographics, larger, therefore reliable sample need stop focusing death rate.

People focus rate mortality gives us gauge cost pandemic could spread unchecked. almost matter pride country learn lessons. appreciate candor maturity. I'll careful future framing make sure dont leave confusion.

And it’s like state governments make attempt make enforceable (setting government run quarantine apartments, actually monitoring comes comes out) Except literally one actually arguing masks 30-40% effective except guy admits it’s anecdotal (and like, even mean? implying 60-70% patients surgery hospital caught kind infection surgeon? case, investigated). Additionally, one talking effectiveness protecting person wearing mask. Across board, argument always most, every, person needs wearing mask effective prevention virus spread.

[Dialysis patients Covid, 3-15% hospitalized Covid patients require dialysis. 3% China, appears it’s climbed 15% virus progressed Western nations, possibly due number people poor baseline organ health infection.

Now ICUs 97%, means reach 100% you’ll start see preventable death due lack access, COVID-related MIs traumas everyone needs ICU care can’t accommodated. let’s pretend hospital beds equal. can’t start putting ICU patients med-Surg rooms staffing med-Surg staff expect ICU care.

That’s even counting financial burden patients, businesses (with lost worker hours) hospitals (patients disability can’t really pay bills). notion mortality rate matters disease demonstrates profound lack understanding.

Like like started new space race, working futuristic tech really changing world.

On hand dude asshole. article, today's press conference, talked positivity rate. Overall, 4-6% positive tests since end May. However, 20-29 crowd 10% positivity rate late subs' rules call fucktard? disagree. wondering. .... pause. would guess populations always increasing. consumers increasing demand every day born. 

Production numbers supply need ever-increasing meet demand. According article one got email HR need feel going lose job,” wrote Vince Woodard, Tesla’s acting human resources director, May email Gabriel viewed Post. “If time feel comfortable returning work, stay home without penalty take time unpaid.“

Granted month fired. got ""failure return"" emails said employment could reinstated assuming come work factory again. all, really

That's plain wrong. Plus, thing everyone keeps overlooking, likely less virus system therefore less severe infection contracted wearing mask. one wouldn’t want med student making decisions changes ventilator. fact, order preference, would prefer respiratory technician, pulmonologist, anesthesiologist, CNA, nurse (or mid level) years ICU experience, fellow, resident, attending medical student.

Also, even though emerging standards care severe COVID still fluid, shift putting many people ventilators. seems many cases high flow nasal cannulas preferred. Nevertheless, patients going need crash intubation. certainly wouldn’t want medical student running show. 10th time I've seen posted reddit today. Mods need something spam fair - effective manager/leader, least things. got EV industry started whereas basically exist previously - even founder, arguably lot good Tesla. also landed re-used rockets, one else managed (I've heard people claim get credit ""new idea"" - standard one ever done anything new innovative, except perhaps cavemen mushroom-induced fever dreams).

He may asshole, he's also effective businessman. always go line something like OP story comes out. wait. Well, honest, many us live this... actual fuck. response! think immune castle tall? Kid beach: ""Daddy, water go away?"" bet could guess many times store owner actually *in* store. 

Somewhere zero one wager. many vaccines speeding along, would think would heard vaccines would ineffective due antibodies. Like would BIG problem far really hasn’t mentioned scientific community.

Also it’s important note antibodies end immunity. Antibodies may disappear months infection body would still recognize virus either leading immunity sever case. worst covid deniers country know exclusively liberal arts university graduates. 

I normally shop expensive supermarkets. Since Feb go discount supermarkets working people seem take serious masks distance. Thank you. lol, playing karen called out. also, fuck dumb! LOL ignoring stuff pushed one part spectrum (early reopening, non-mask-wearing) trying blame another end spectrum (people protesting police violence) despite available evidence saying 100%, completely totally, big-time wrong. 

so yeah, trying advocate political agenda. quite difficult dead people get jobs, especially today's economy, checks really big help them. Treat respect dignity due human life, never question value, prepare go fucking war anyone threatens rights. psychiatrist, seems like control. little control lives. see something control do. People facets life whether good not. gotta get folks washing hands social distancing too.

This makes sad. I've shit whole 2020 year already (Seattle). like people can't learn something literally doorstep. Someone copyright name make part #BLM movement. put facemasks! think there's lot 12 bars following health protocols Texas Yes. dexamethasone effective treatment now, many cases happened prior June ended deaths could pushed (or later), effective treatments mortality rate lower. effective treatments poor souls never chance get since they're already dead. definition “life sustaining” incredibly broad barely anything shut down. easy either find way consider life sustaining, ask nicely waiver get approved or, company’s choice, stay open anyway face 0 repercussions. 

I work company serves construction companies MontCo. barely dent business. Every one vendors, ranging major equipment manufacturers old man street rebuilds alternators, open entire time. road technicians swamped calls tons construction companies kept working. 

It’s small miracle we’ve managed flatten curve. Still one work wears mask, neither overwhelming majority customers/vendors I’ve come contact with. Elon Musk bad Trump.  piece shit got go, Gee almost like person makes choice going shops spending money dont feel safe.... nothing rise Covid cases seeing SC. send hospital ship fully used enough hospital ships every city. bet they'd call guard set temporary hospitals. Correct. world surgery room. that’s you’re, your. Maybe learn little grammar want taken seriously. Test results coming lot quickly now, back-dating necessary accuracy due long results taking come in. wait ten days result, they'd report positive new addition total today, add positive day symptom onset. better method tracking rate, especially testing that's prone error. guy hospital knew covid, tested *five times* returned positive result, example. Mostly point, tests performed today result today. work essential. worker not. Weed isn’t physically addictive, it’s psychologically addictive, words compulsion acts like addiction every way. $ome $ay it'$ ju$t bu$ine$$ a$ u$ual run capacity. SARS-1 didnt disappear burned through. disappeared starved hosts. SARS-1 infectious symptoms much easier control much less intense public health measures.

SARS jr. burned NYC New England. Ab studies support that. burned Italy, Spain France. stopped interventions. Cases rise people get overconfident. look Israel.

My CDC-equivalent RKI says estimate IFR 0.5-1.0% estimate untested cases 5x-8x reported cases. European antibody preprints fall line that.

The problem IFR. problem spread. like Cholera. totally treatable disease (rehydration, e'lytes, abiosis), almost one dies proper treatment still CCDC risk category 1 (the worst). SARS-CoV-2 2 treated like category 1 novel. makes ppl sick quickly, ramp HC-system.

The problem ain't IFR optimal conditions. problem wildfire spread eliminate optimal conditions u cannot suppress even mitigate spread. friend Florida says less thousand people died pneumonia past 10 years suddenly thousands official pneumonia deaths state year.. sub gonna love headline, they're gonna hate also applies them. 

SIR models horribly inaccurate, herd immunity probably lower think (although really know low), fatality rate trending downwards, mask usage superfluous outdoor areas proper distancing, correlation Trump voting U.S. outbreaks positive explanation even strongest correlation.   mean physically throw beds watch health bar fill back up? sounds like political PR spin me. order consider credible I'd want hear current capacity available, many new hospitalizations expect given period time.

 ""***We ability go far higher that*** *in terms ICU beds utilize COVID-19 patients,"" Boom said. ""...We PPE (personal protection equipment) capability, (and) learned enormous amounts caring people COVID-19.*""  

Really, stated 97%... ""*Something rotten state Denmark*"" one flying anywhere? Uh huh. sent 1 billion dollars dead people. clue. know think fell marketing German must luxury brand, hell thing Elon Musk: Donald Trump Nerds

(Also known alter ego, Leon Skum) insurance says is..... think approaching worse isolated hotspots mostly NYC spread throughout country multiple hotspots getting worse.

% tested infected better metric use. Also hospital capacity. Agreed, Professor Chaos really responsible party tried crimes humanity.  feel way, in-laws high 70s think I'm scared getting bc visiting them. go everywhere use mask mandatory, still want know kill them.
I visit mask backyard. AZ what, 7 months preggo? effective immediately stop testing Whitehouse? more... still test important people shit luck. one flying anywhere. airlines keep schedules service cities pre-pandemic unless get waiver DOT CARES act proves us correct.

Humans cannot lockdown forever. wave hit Seattle, NYC, Chicago, etc earlier hitting places.

NBD Knowing know Americans individualism tribalism, I'm sure still subset people deliberately violate quarantine reason like told simply like communicated requirement. Yet go insane things like “Muslim terrorists moving us” “illegal Mexicans taking jobs” don’t know either, certain exist.

Edit: thought news story read recently. studies blue algae shown may cause diseases like ALS MS. interviewed guy fished lake full stuff asked concerned. said whole thing fake fished time didn’t MS couldn’t true.  whole field psychology says otherwise. seems making facts based upon personal world view therefore discussion possible. 1 internet search buying Tesla 4 years ago.

Bullet dodged Chevy. addressing one specific aspect comment. give opinion anything else. one updated soon. big deal (assuming factor end elective surgeries) case anyone wondering deaths soared 2,000 today nowhere. New Jersey started reporting probable covid deaths added 1,854 today

EDIT: worldometer I'm checking, 2000 deaths gone now. Today's count back 300 U.S. Never seen happen voted President Bone Spurs. think would happen put narcissistic moron charge? *live* with

Not long Thing is, people care massive loss life. care sports super illegal so. God labour laws really slipped away us. ancestors fought hard labour rights fucking reason damn near gave away. It’s fucking shame is. wouldn’t it. age ranges worrying. share opinion mate.

The fact evidence support side literally ""here's got opinion from"". support

A poor use time hating people know. never meet man who's successful dislikes people success.

Guess that's dislike Ohio week work hardly seen anyone wearing mask except food service. told different customers “Hey don’t wear mask”, declined offer. Global herd immunity outcome now.

There possibility. problem isn’t current level ICU occupancy, it’s increase patients needing ICU beds. goal replace fossil fuel cars... really deluded instance.

Uh, what? goal replacing fossil fuel card anything ever increasing production quotas? risking life lives everyone come contact acceptable simply place going status quo order monopolize expanding market? average. Oh, gotcha, thanks much clearing up. anyone know stats many added compared deaths today? Ironically, Trump putting loyal supporters jeopardy halfwit rallies. Freedom! Sounds like that’s *your* definition maybe. allowing differing opinions spirit tolerance? Pretty sure goal. company actually delivering promise

Give break lol serious? 'full self driving' ass can't billionaire without sacrificing people you. Someone always suffering bottom them. Yep, teacher stayed home schools shut March. husband essential worker wear masks, still level exposure customers we’re afraid infecting family members/friends. feels precautions taken nothing, cities hospitals get overwhelmed likely shut next weeks. city basically back started, fact even worse. 

I think people going assume everyone that, we’re not. people discipline stick along, last even longer others wanted pretend virus gone. possible stay safe, takes work. Yeah you’re speaking ex-NIA postbac. observed enough research misconduct months applied grad school left year, despite door open stay two. NIDA, hand... good work. They’re also popular YOLO college spring breakers type crowds. So, it’s perfect storm combination people likely catch covid purposeful negligence people statistically likely die COVID. youth think they’re invulnerable; older generations watch Fox think it’s hoax. forget designer face masks. wonder talked  Thanks saying first!

We changing rules. Alot states bend backwards, even allowing violate law worker safety hazard, dont get reported. helps injecting money state. You’re really bad troll Eh, bullshit. Americans average less scientifically literate generation two (or six) ago, level comparable European nations. 

Now want country whose citizens don’t value science point large one Asia kinds superstitions hold value scientific methods. Wegmans? listen experts look many articles (also care news happens outside America west) make decisions. I've known since 12 stupid lot people people choose remain ignorant. Looking trash media gets popular also shows lack critical thinking individuality mentality. Looooool Donald Trump self-made man. That's RICH. cause pandemic shouldnt problem Welp guess people gonna cancel Tesla now. Spending time airport airplane group people tied one nation's hotspots seems like bad idea especially considering spending time older relatives. Usns comfort like 1000 beds. listened great podcast weeks ago talked Sweden approach Covid. Yup, Sweden natural advantages, yeah still struggling: addictive, withdrawal systems persist 24 hrs experience. effects people differently. nearly poisonous destructive alcohol is. Can't true. America greatest nation planet. Everywhere else third world shithole. Thanks protestors minutes *lot less* 16 hours recent research found virus remain active aerosol floating around room. kill it, least make weaker, airborne, lot less worry inhaling. STOP CASUISTRY!!! 

This 50s, 60s, 70s, 80s, 90s early 2000s. 

Hard facts take precedent outdated belief. 

I believe God know end day answer yourself. 

Quit using pitiable excuses mask unending fear loathful insecurities!!

If good thing politicians pigs show us, conduct yourself. 
So thank you. could wrong believe CEOs hospitals don’t want elective surgeries stop since that’s big source income. public stays calm less pressure government and, turn, less pressure policies. guess using overflow bad press, they'll instead try redirect people hospitals keep non-ICU beds bit. Nothing see folks, well! is. research massive outside protests intensified severity pandemic. nobody daring mention BLM protests? Boring Company agree basically worthless, makes think SpaceX merely marketing scheme? guys bitching work shop walmart... bring downvotes theyre shitty, leave. saw coming ?!?!? Clearly reasonable folks outside Government Huh? Hmm wonder street live on?? 🤔    think lot (I hope lot too!) Thinking along lines, point enough physical teachers enact plan... Let's forget barring local governments implementing stricter controls state government.

Thats took three months AZ sort mask policy. fact, state still doesn't.

On Wednesday, Ducey allowed local governments mandate masks.

By Thursday, essentially entire Phoenix metro area, Tucson Flagstaff implemented sort mask order.

By Friday, Maricopa County (home Phoenix stupid high percentage state population) mandated masks county-wide.

Literally state government hamstringing local officials. Look anyone list. American dream. whole ""meritocracy myth"" line bogus. bitter can't hack without someone else's help. People always give shit taking dad's car dealership, cars sell themselves. I'm supposed sell business live rest life instead making money, people jealous? Get real. work hard play hard, easy life, one chose made myself. going data. cause something confirmed proof positive linked mean isnt. climate change. There's nothing absolutly proven either. csnt be, many variables.

By time is, late. quite. IFR going down. Places big outbreaks early always going higher mortality rate overall ones started China, Italy, Spain, NYC etc guinea pig work. ran company, long would let employees work still paying them? think sustainable company? Please explain works. reason commented tell right wrong. commented stance black-white. I.e. GDP isnt mentioned, definitely must lying purposely withholding data. agree arguable numbers used article may reflect reality, however therefore accusing lying purposely trying steer agenda steps further.

This really productive way find truth, say, mentioning part story significantly change it.

For example, source shows Sweden still economic growth, however article linked, showed estimated GDP whole year, estimates similar shrinkage compared eu countries.

In short, data presented thread may still correspondence eachother, better discuss discrepancies calm manner starting tell fraud. Thanks lord’s work good path, people stopped taking seriously. parties gatherings everywhere last 3 weeks. 

This people assumed started seeing \~3 infections daily +40 recoveries. small degree. needs something push population edge. Strong messages levels government, enforcement backup, combined walking back opening metrics went downhill would made difference. Can't go bar, share drinks spread covid 50 people bar closed, bar outdoor seating distanced tables. mean convention prevent genocide article 2, section b c?

Crimes humanity outline Rome Statue International Criminal court. 

They've already said America needs get used genocide.  Future economists depend it. pandemic, everything happens faster expect. That's important overreact. That's interesting side note take away prime minister's opinion. consider little disingenuous accuse thread jacking one understand fascination downvoting business. surprised much fixated mentioned it. Maybe little close truth?

Says one felt burning need PM it. understand downvote affects much. Besides, know ""quote conversation"" accurate way put it, seeing everything wrote written anything. unfamiliar lower Midwest, southern portions Illinois, Indiana Ohio Kentucky’s sphere influence, therefore COVID-19 trends cities like Cincinnati, Evansville Carbondale theory similar South Midwest.  easy hate one bunch Karens fighting haircut lol. Also many people live using air conditioning. going places virus survive using mask. big bar lots space, ok, go use bathroom beers in. many wash hands? Touch door handle. Pay credit card, touch pen. drinking covid? extra weight? (I know have)

edit - words guy posting old data claiming new, claiming good news absolutely zero evidence. Florida, California, Arizona heading path would thought building economy solely premised exploiting rubes bad idea? Im fan stuck house work sometimes swear first month houston stay safe stay home easiest best month working life truth political everyone cooking books favor. dont believe anyones “numbers”. found shady hospital practices get money puttimg people ventilators get money making cause death covid money lost me. Im living life Staying safe eliminating COVID reprehensible?  We’re American. don’t learn don’t want to. Masks contribute prevention, practically countries tried policy masks normal life, idea know policy feasible ludicrous.

If ignore country part: Hong Kong. Also, Japan, lot it. kind lockdown measure last months. detailed data, presentation bit dense though. Ugh, know coworker talking about. Italian doctor claimed virus mutating becoming less potent. one guy, looks like questionable news sources really ran it, perfectly displaying humans hardwired dismiss facts fit worldview (or case, accept unfounded evidence)!

Here's ""news"" cycle. Mask mask, go places tons people. hey pocket book looking lot better  Scott Rubio must part deep state lady talking about. /s literally ask thing.

If understanding correct Texas would hit peak 2-3 weeks locked today. dont want save economy. want rob every American every last penny think well something. Na bumm, das kann ja noch heiter werden. Hmmm... think antibody tests maybe undercount 20% bc people produce Abs (asymptomatics). also over-estimate cross-reactivity low-prevalence setting.
While Ab-testing lot uncertainitie seems align general progress virus different countries. correlate Ab studies different European nations. grocers union shops? Hard tell difference. Symptoms mild could come anything -- cold, allergies, whatever. Houston...we issue. modern science works hugely unscientific assumption race plays major part human body

That’s fundamentally untrue. You’re upset it’s focusing scientific illiteracy using outdated methods support racist conclusions desperately crave.

An example would medicine studies black people susceptible Sickle Cell Anemia. studied extensively.

Saying black people lower IQs something literally supported racists like you. 

Just case wasn’t clear, **you racist utilizing pseudoscience unconnected claims make racist points** that’s case least let business owners fighting chance. businesses big life sucking corporations. can’t again.  anything US juncture turn things around? don’t think I’m doomer seems like status quo 2 years so. Like we’ve thrown hands going herd immunity. Ok cases per million compared counties?  statement comes executives it’s usually calm people rather communicate helpful information. forced Abbott rescind Elective Surgeries.

GG, SARS-CoV-2. Well, no, we've thought since March. Well shit. Gabriel said responded email. Naro able secure job. Gabriel, declined speak human resources representative unless call could recorded conversation could moved email, said Tesla lost trust.

is it? literally chose speak HR. Obama, Bush Dubya, Clinton, Bush senior, etc. would handled much better. dropped this: /s  Winning!  seen footage people forcedly locked building though. people hard guarded quarantine true now, wont weeks even started mitigation efforts immediately. That’s TMC. 64 hospitals Houston 12% COVID patients (as two days ago). even tiny fraction numbers may see inch closer exponential

WorldoMeter reports US 33k cases Texas California fully reported cases. agree. 200,000 cases day? possibly good? wouldn’t call thorough academic report said makes logical sense. never fully committed staying open locking ruining benefits either sadly retaining negatives both.  Well guess Arkansas dumbest state union.  intrusive, effective Terrifying would someone cancer about? rather not. imagine why. Ski season Australia starting now. look pile bodies say fake news!  Yes Sometimes gotta smack cheeks, get cheeks smacked. Even deadly pandemic going on. Good luck mindset next weeks.  cards reference ada, osha Omg, no. Even 2nd year residents ready  norm many tech jobs Bay Area, CA. company well. I'm sure Canada, manufacturing retail jobs nearly amenable working home. Yep often overlooked problem. many people need care, long person needs care for. Often times person going ventilator occupies rest life, 2+weeks high resource consumption, lose patient, put another patient vent...

That definitely improved beginning pandemic, mainly efforts use ventilator response decline, instead trying improve outcomes things like CPAP/BiPAP, steroids blood thinners vs mechanical respiration. 

But yeah, would perversely much better mortality rate killed people much faster. taking long time die occupies resources could spent people might live. phase nothing safety. best precautions change South Korea pretty good job doesn’t wear seatbelt driving?! That’s literally reason invented! got feeling he’ll use money. Like “Biden won’t give stimulus two them!” Fucking minimum wage workers. They’ll fold. resume flights China... money money money would get fired job saying something like that. Well hello cutie. What's name? ""he accomplished""
Lol think mean employees accomplished Sorry, shrunk ball distilled cringe said ""class solidarity.""

You're revolutionary, circlejerking lowest hanging fruit ideas. Reddit lot. reopening seen rise cases deaths... woulda knew? SHOCKED wearing masks aren’t anywhere near 100% protecting virus isn’t enough. :/ I'm trying think trauma patients, heart attacks, strokes, cancer patients, etc. hospitals able adequately accommodate (with space, staff, equipment) top COVID patients. like people even take consideration. lot people going fucking die. Can’t help think spike age group due civil unrest.

I still agree need unrest. Wish someone high could use compassion understanding sooth wounds racism violence. message heard action taken crowds would calm. someone could that. responses pandemic.

Because pandemic. fricken disgrace. Please patronize big business unless really something **need**. If? mean confirmation bias? Conservative ideology dead. serves absolutely constructive purpose society. Trickle economics, Watergate, Iraq wars, labor unions, climate policy, shitty criminal justice, horrible education, wealthy tax breaks, anti-science, voter suppression, jingoism, on... 

It's dogshit. single piece real agenda helps majority people vote them. Every while, toss gesture like trying stop marriage equality. that's get mouthbreathers polls. actually give shit Christians. care money. bug, virus. morons. Kind does. example Tuolumne County religious services protest allowed. Tuolumne Lumber Jubilee changed name Tuolumne Lumber Protest. Making mask mandatory won’t anything all, masks completely pointless comes corona, don’t believe me? Read this, say anything otherwise you’re ones denial anyone actually read article? ICU beds 100% expecting units prepped. ICU normally functions 80-90% capacity, surprise. article literally states well equipped capacity. probably wouldn’t need one everyone wore mask public, pants. virus would still spread would way sustainable, probably level lockdown would prevent. TMC trusted faulty data? clearly 3 different numbers day April TMC. That's fault how? Find new job...in middle pandemic...while 20 million people looking work! major Texas urban areas experiencing similar spike cases. COVID patient counts statewide going 300 patients per day.

Is Houston bit ahead? Sure. days, weeks.

Help coming. Governor Abbott crippled successful local response (had local, Abbott abdicated action like Trump - wanted push reopen)

My estimate peak hospital use 4 weeks exposure. still done significant rollback.

Texas fucked, know it. asking something happened? article ssays 3 hospitalized. locking up.

LMFAO.

There months lovking here. said motorcycles seat belts. 

I said that's choice, said ""exactly, choice"".

Basically ""muh freedumbs"" argument. said law get caught.

Like wtf supposed that? point, run testing capacity limits labs, way case counts rise day day % positive increase. Even exponential growth, think end linear detected cases. mean **“Just Die With”** ?  necessary may be... COME ON! small town southern AZ Facebook group page every post Karen complaining wearing mask can’t enforce they’re gonna say special disabilities get away wearing one bed empty? Yep, should't need get deadly car accident know driving carelessly could kill you, apparently COVID-19 way people take measures kill virus almost kill them. ... want ICU numbers 64 hospitals. Reading 12% Houston area ICU beds used COVID patients doesn’t tell 64 hospitals left.

Ok, TMC 100% much capacity left 64 hospitals? That’s important, Houston huge patients could easily transported hospitals. missed almost 1000. Number Texas today 5996. find reasons tell won’t bad. I’ve heard countless people say won’t bad SC people spread don’t rely public transportation. ""survivor"" share experience, majority experience - severe illnesses - mild even take sick day it.

Occasionally it’s true, probably far often it’s (at least within lifetime’s today). worldometer reporting period different john hopkins, california stats updated incrementally. people wearing masks entire pandemic.

Every time go see people fewer wearing mask. bars absolutely ridiculous. reason wear gloves laboratory isn’t it’s sterile environment , it’s literally avoid contact pathogens, chemicals, reagents, etc. 

I one lab go strict wear two sets gloves, strip outer pair touch “clean “equipment thoroughly decontaminate it. happen fuck touch phone dunk bleach solution they’ll allow laboratory. 

As microbiologist working said, much less concerned bring might accidentally take you.

I agree completely, however, people using gloves correctly, hell won’t even wear masks correctly all. want now! Ignorance look good people believe garbage.

I'm sure already asked here, I'm looking advice people stayed informed recently have. currently living Atlanta significant considering heading back Illinois spend week family. feel like smart idea would better stay home here. reason I'm considering significant lives Illinois, take trip him, sure would come back. end world obviously, would nice stay me. 

Can anyone give insight advice worth making trip staying family? Want make sure I'm making smart, informed decision. Thanks advance! Welcome Disney China! Enter room. solder shut. See two weeks! 
*small world starts play* tried NYC. 3 days 600,000+ signatures petition. rescinded inhumane, is. hospitals hadn’t even implemented yet solo births happen according wife’s Mom group. God hope joking. Let know getting wrong:

The average age someone killed car crash 38. 38 40.37 years lifespan left according actuary tables. average age someone dying Covid-19 78-81. Let’s use 79. 79, average lifespan left 8.82 however, unlike car crashes, Covid-19 typically kills co-morbidities wouldn’t typically lifespan others cohort. Conservatively, say average 79 year old died Covid-19 4 years life left average. Covid-19 death represents ten times less effect overall average lifespan typical motor vehicle accident death. threat average lifespan motor vehicle accidents, death count Covid-19 would ten times higher. isn’t likely year’s end. Really sorry hear that... hopefully you’re decent treatment regimen, least. think assume that. 

At time, ERs saw drastic (in range 50%) drops visits things like heart attacks strokes, normally account high portion deaths even normal amounts treatment. show hospital showed later average. people recover home.

While I'm sure excess deaths due C-19, assuming necessarily going give us accurate picture. Lol move MI. 9.4% mortality right now. Breath CO2 realize much need breath-mint! America decided existence severity partisan issue 

Also fucks congress? Certain elements culture nurture 'victim' mentality. Read point fall apart. Yes right principle. 

Besides. pointing loophole people, certain people, try assert (bs) rights Necrophilia. Nice. could solve lot problems long period time kind capital. You’re backing wall Texas. hospitals full gig up. Throw 2020 trash! stupid hesitant rushed vaccine, vaccines tend take years good reason. stupid ""anti-vax"", obviously, I've got STEM degree liberal would take pretty strong convincing jump board vaccine gets pushed quicker vaccine history.

And pumping man-hours solution arriving something safe months time, problems testing control groups time itself, intractable. DeSantis must issue mask order, without delay.

Even does, least two weeks increase already baked in. 

It feels like looking windshield oncoming tree, driver blind drunk foot mashed floor gas pedal. hospitals ton ICU beds. big hospitals Houston little 11 rooms operate full capacity time. let's say 4 people recovering heart surgery 4 people pneumonia whatever, 3 rooms ready emergency situation like stroke, COVID patients take last remaining beds someone coming stroke sent another hospital, one problem covid19 patients took ambulance ready rooms. 

So normally ICU beds full capacity specifically allow small individual emergencies. really handle pandemic. lot ICU patients need room 2-3 weeks like COVID-19 patients. cant move different room stabilize they're still contagious. 

So short story version, hospitals normally extensive amounts ICU beds they're meant smaller emergencies rest beds meant shorter duration individual emergencies. Highly unlikely. Various areas big outbreaks total population death rates higher 0.25% Great enforced. major freeways out?  we're testing less right? That’s bad. also PI friends research coronaviruses funding hard come last 5-6 years. They’ve warning while. Plenty papers back SARS MERS rage like 2013 NIH wasn’t looking fund recently. It’s sad really underfunded basic science research is. [Aged like room temp Yeah, also! Also, January thought going war Iran. Also, last summer also thought going war Iran. afraid Trump starts shooting mouth off, threatening nations Twitter again, going piss wrong country wrong time. What’s amazing amount people think wearing mask doesn’t anything. correlation low intelligence damn that’s stupid. Could also people getting lower initial viral doses social distancing mask wearing, well deathly afraid anyone coughing/sneezing.  Think babies born girls stopped taking pregnancy tests read article speculated finding ended collaboration lab Wuhan. lab Wuhan alleged source covid19 acording conspiracy theory someone told president. 

As far understand researching source (as likely transmission bat) research labs still ongoing.

In (uneducated) opinion actually gives China way influence narrative since still providing money research. hope labs China good integrity towards finding truth. Ontario, Canada 3/4 population whopping 165 new cases. 

GET FUCKEN SHIT TOGETHER US! nuts bunch us US fully utterly understand we're sitting back watching rest country bat shit crazy tryin kill us all. Yeah might hard getting hang others much Someone bad math This. $13 left, received unemployment, $300 overdue bills. I'm afraid another lockdown set back even finding employment, even send another 1200 it'll gone immediately. friends even worse off.  i’d rather masks become mandatory americans could move lives, it’s silly ever think government would right thing point ever  © 🍊 moron worries. savings panicking yet. I'm sure knows. contingency plan needs happen. end day can’t force people sit homes 2 years anything. Herd immunity makes sense point Manufacturing. RemindMe! September 1 2020 ""...the soothing light end tunnel......is freight train comin yo waaaaayyyyy-YAY-YAY!"" Body bags ice trucks get filled. least option table, said Florida. God, feel much! get. would properly dealing pandemic result less popularity? president would literally great reason throw cash voters name stimulus. lot companies take hit that's money throwing help. one situations problem solved throwing cash it..

HATE FACTS agree nature ADA combined HIPAA allow verification. don’t want manager mistakenly bars access. store makes accommodations eloquently pointed out, yep. fakers lose. don’t, win.

We’re using store example. work say salon bowling alley anything service e outside doesn’t outside version. Another political lever conspiracy fuel? haven’t rolled in-person learning look like either! Kindergarten teacher, idea job entail come September. Well see, cases going up, thats testing more. long dont look hospitalizations going rising death rate, like nobody sick wonder higher would change things. remember reading somewhere 1918 flu still wear masks. Guess can't fix stupid. I'm back full hours work last 3 weeks governor Dipshit can't bother letting local officials enforce pandemic precautions. Amazing people wearing masks amid cheering. meh specifically targeted slow positive cases per Trumps quotes. Nahhh. I’m cool wearing mask work. Thanks confirm. weekend, smaller town,20k-30k population, hour half outside Houston. Literally one general public wore mask. social distancing restaurants. 

Coming Austin people even somewhat cautious, seeing mind blowing. 

These also people saying “just ready done.” Talking protests coronavirus. one taking serious smaller towns. 

It disheartening. Revenues losing jobs. Thank you! I’m going best give kids high quality education deserve, whatever setting may be. HS here. idea either. really shouldn’t thing.

Yeesh man COVID Tour something?? conspiracy publications recommend? Absolutely. Home births scary AF understand someone would make choice.  figure?  similarly, even know real number fatalities? I've biking almost every single day, pretty nice actually. Trump would gone vote bet anti-mask crew told could catch AIDS standing next someone crowded bar they'd masks lickety-split bent shape it, apparently they're too-cool-for school comes avoiding COVID. LOOKING CELLULAR PHONE DATA??? PREPOSTEROUS. 6ft under. Remember Panama Papers? can't understand logic going crowded place eating and/or drinking around people, part wearing masks middle pandemic killed hundred thousand people. almost feel like I'm kind crazy bizzaro world people purposely ignore logic can. loons again. mean IF. Cases could soon rapidly grow 200,000-250,000 months.  cult. cult leader crazy. crazy. Damn comment history shitshow understanding basic physics. locaton reference I'm central indiana  country went protesting 2 weeks ago (many still protesting). Seems right would pretty quick way spread it. post locked due number purely political comments. 

For information, [please review Oh😒 even CFR necessarily there's often large delays states catching recovered cases really deaths / confirmed closed cases they've gotten around posting. There’s enough information people cared knew risks. It’s people thought freedoms risk it’s hoax. flat-out release hospitalization data, changed ICU usage reporting days ago. I've flu shot 3 times. I've flu 3 times. time shot. believe caused it.

For much unknown corona virus. fact thinks says ""we open"" means anything shows dumb is. Look econony since hes declared open. Stocks keep dropping. Why? Beca economy rebound virus least controlled. say ge wants virus gone numbers show otherwise. know, ***only reason*** issue political first place one political party decided make political. 

This automod counterproductive. Least favorite? even close. McConnell least favorite ever live. Graham probably number 2. Rubio probably, like, 15 least. Thanks, sure. Holy shit, people really way making everything revolve around themselves. know back High School last menstruation was.

This unreadable. lot privileged view points here. USA done terrible job providing financial support poorest people. people still gotten stimulus check. people need go make money survive blame I'm convinced gets sexual gratification causing psychological harm people. got email surgical volumes back pre covid levels (I’m surgical resident). We’ll see long lasts though. straight murder black people, also actively support dangerous behavior infects black people disproportionately deadly, quickly spreading disease. almost like state-sponsored genocide. fucked. need move canada. CA governor government yet issue guidelines amusement parks. Disney isn’t necessarily because... watch get blamed protests going partly responsible, ignore buisnesses states opened quickly. fucked up. going take country care dead? knew closed, honestly thought/ felt like recently open back up. know still closed... doesnt surprise really either way... thanks putting back radar.

Entitled Tina would probably bring socks kids sick ass ruin everyone. ""The president United States civilian"" said White House spokesman Judd Deere

Has anyone White House read Constitution?

The President receives compensation services, rendered Chief Executive Nation, individual parts duties. part compensation paid sums appropriated military naval forces; equally clear Constitution President’s duties Commander Chief represent part duties ex officio Chief Executive [Article II, sections 2 3 Constitution] latter’s office civil office. [Article II, section 1 Constitution . . . . ] President enlist in, inducted drafted into, armed forces. Nor, subject court-martial military discipline. contrary, Article II, section 4 Constitution provides ‘The President, [Vice President] Civil Officers United States shall removed Office Impeachment for, Conviction Treason, Bribery high Crimes Misdemeanors.’ 

This means president must wear mask. I’m attractive wear mask  don’t think numbers mean anything states like Hawaii Montana due lose case numbers frankly I’m skeptical numbers all. It’s based super incomplete information great, needs fucks. give props Twitter reporting Jan. bro came back Canada Xmas headed back Beijing Jan 6. went dinner night saw tweet ppl passing streets Wuhan. told careful said Beijing's nowhere close Wuhan. kept sending updates flew back end Jan. I’ve heard mixed things vaccine it’s effectiveness. covid similar flu virus likely mutate vaccine may really stop spread much. speculation though. I’m sure would help some, maybe eradicate elective surgery still on? They're reprimanded spreading unproven factually wrong police believed virus confirmed SARS. believed spreading rumors. asked acknowledge fault."" think inhumane separate baby mother birth. put baby bassinette 6 feet away. Baby's need human contact. also interfere breastfeeding. Where’d get 50% from? doubt 50% country daily interactions someone sick old. do, wear mask practice social distancing. Problem solved ur welcome.  lot friends want wear masks conservative. Boths sides need much much stronger stance. couple years ago, unrelated Covid. unfortunately, no, never made home that. make ICU ultimately long-term care facility make long, albeit volition. Weird figure R0 real time

It's guestimated based number positive cases testing. necessarily mean accurate though. number cases artificially high due targeted testing artificially low due lack testing, estimated value going accurate. 4966 yesterday, record high. ....why keep repeated, old record 39k least acording worldmeter, back around april 29th. It’s almost like “front line” doesn’t give shit “cause” aka economy. Except Florida. ""That rona vires aint reel"". fed won’t help states, states won’t help citizens, citizens won’t help themselves. RIP uncle sam wouldn’t. picture ""ironically"" showing someone wearing mask country ""everyone wears mask"" actually showing foreigner wearing mask. IOW, really irony. hurts see numbers. Precious lives lost,people getting ill affects rest lives. wanna one people.

My gosh ,start taking serious folks....so sad.... I’m one blaming one political party, ignoring everything else going on. wearing masks social distancing main problems right now.

You mean like...at protests? people weren’t wearing masks (and definitely n95s) within 2 ft hours end every day? can’t trash one (working) ignore other.

Going Best Buy shop wearing mask keeping away others lot safe standing crowd 4+ hours. Getting teeth cleaned seems comparatively safe well, given gloved masked. Anyone wearing mask putting around danger, ie playing FreeDumb card.  Florida, Texas Arizona refusing mandate masks huge reason shit ton people going die, that’s opposite fair compromise. way see it, unmasked people threat health safety time.

On risk assessment level doesn’t make sense, people need concerned thing likely kill them- COVID-19. Disney World Florida still set open believe.

[Walt Disney World Resort Phased Reopening Important Information • Walt Disney World theme parks open beginning July good California, much Florida. Lowkey better game mario I'm well aware. trying buy N95 masks February got really freaked news coming China (I'm glad didnt, given shortage).

That's excuse anymore though. Cloth infinitely better nothing. Smart mom there’s company may household name operates 500M annual revenue, called AON. They’re risk management firm (insurance related) notified employees would receiving 20% pay cut working home. Apparently came light 20% breached policy statute without proper notice employees could file severance package leave firm. learned changed pay cut 19 percent nullified severance requests. That’s pretty shitty, can’t feel proud working company right now. realize joking, throw no, iFR 1-2% range depending antibody studies referencing. time said done, things keep going way we'd looking 3-6 million dead. liklihood masks distancing we'll probably keep deaths 500k end year, probably 1m time pandemic finally burns (assuming will, admittedly, great assumption). 

But hey, million dead another great depression fucking urge people stay home nonessential things wear masks absolutely needed go out. Well terrifying worst case shit isn’t ? Put masks people ! Yes it’s inconvenient however life could save maybe own.... ur parents imagine done everything right whole time. stayed quarantine, going grocery store pharmacy. catch careless person going applebees getting haircuts. get hospital die hallway. See fucking bullshit media portrays this. mean get sounds much worse scare people taking seriously (which people need) fucking honest say hey look quick filled up, could happen hospital too. wish 90 percent Americans would quit thinking political joke actually take seriously. SECOND WAVE TIME Throw California mix. Bay Area getting pummeled know sounds crazy quote provided actually disputes title.

The employees fired scummy move said leave fine fired them; firing publicly criticizing company covid response. seems case; government going offer bailout small businesses. want people die unnecessarily either, also want start another public health crisis form massive unemployment (more now), peoples' lives livelihoods destroyed government supposedly side. 

In perfect world, we'd ride lockdown there's vaccine everyone would go back world pre corona. live world, unfortunately hard decisions going made. Since less guarantee government stands today going bail small businesses, opinion hard decision stands riding out, ordering mask mandates, managing virus surges best come. Wait what? telling massive crowds reason large spike across us, many going state state. New York fine can't reason. Gotcha! understood love guy, man builds worlds biggest payment processor fund innovative technology mega-industry said possible, got doubted throughout entire process everyone continued succeed. Built solar power innovation, built electric vehicle innovation, built company goes fucking space something nations sought decades ago. amazing story, get party fucking lost mind, started Trump cheerleader endangering quality life workers. understand expecting excellence employees, many people hold accountable getting shit done, make considerations things endangering people literally breaking back you, reward beyond minimum requirement via payment contract really saying thank giving back them, kind dick. hope uses platform personal financial rewards something else major innovative benefits mankind there's type moral reward absolute bullshit decision end day, problems people employed problems whether chooses not. fucking people, people bought vision helped keep going growing response fuck die? loyalty bullshit anymore actively negative opinion products endorses unless changes actions. Sorry hear that. remember watching utter confusion rural part state responded (I'm Chicago us terrified becoming next NYC back March early April, reaction quite bit different). Anyway, sucks become politicized. people know support president acting like total hypocrites.  Complaining people taking anything seriously, yet day IG story crowded house party without masks. Death rate matters 

We quite well. article says following them. need remember people smart. mom dad stayed away. others told safe. States received $400B CARES Act. need leadership top down, aid state local governments shortcoming. support it. agree statement, that's message perplexing. Shit going get worse Texans change behavior. ""this fine"" opposite message sending. New Zealand beat Plague Inc. Serious question. religious folks hearing this? message uniform see people complaining KNOW Devil trying make wear mask KNOW God masks. messaging originate? ""Everything fine"" powerful country world! hear? That's like public officials. sorry, why? want get cholesterol count blood sugar order, chief. hear civil wars quite taxing. “All life boats jackets gone always use big doors stay water!” 

Should bright side... Abbott, Reality, Reality Abbot, Abbott nice meet reality, I'm still closer old friend political expediency. virus create multiple people gather. Someone bring party. 111 new cases today..64 LTC, 42 retests people trying leave hospital. actually look data head sand ""I thought hurricane season over!"" impossible. German friends told USA still covid problems. Help people ? believe ? way going Mars would help people ? nothing beside sand, earth would pile trash would still better living. Sending dozen guys would change anything overpop pollution. achievement... could say ""for science"" want show much great engineer is. sad see New York Italy England France and...

I think problem lack solidarity. ""Me, me, me"" thats thats important alot people. Stay fuck home! Technically speaking Government. represent consent. Unfortunately consented system allows minority rule.

They minority, make mistake that. know minority know getting smaller number. electoral college one dumbest damn things came with. Voters Wyoming hold way power voters CA NY. con love whatever necessary keep power structure place, even detriment Democracy. created equal, equally represented.

I think DT see biggest growth voter turnout November, vote him. way people feeling right shit going election day. try stop people voting riots.

At point adults need step frog march Pres out. matters? I’ve work, it’s like size huge mall. I’m sure find places shuffle patients, patient rooms huge, put 4 room comfortably, it’s start slippery slope. Still waiting stimulus check. Could really use I’m single dad two boys  remember Australia Fires like decade ago guys one two medically vulnerable categories? 70 years old?

Even would hunker are. Wear masks go down, wash hands get back putting groceries. odds catching virus getting sick enough go hospital getting even sicker needing ICU really, really, really low. Houston runs ICUs start medevacing people hospitals converting units ICUs. mention authoritative government. Sweden denied opening theme parks, exceedes 50+ people rule. Sweden’s numbers rising due 2 reasons. Graduation (an extreme amount kids caught it) free testing (covid anti-bodies) Greater Stockholm area. takes 3 months guys election?! voting done one night done? governor grandchildren? seem impression live democracy. Yikes. Plenty sufficient feel free delete one else sees it.
 
Good luck!!!!! Get ready pictures people dying hospital parking lots, alot refrigeration trucks bodies people angry government administration. coworker supervisor entire hospital three months ago, transferred. entire job assigning beds.

Edit: would include every clinic, sister hospital, urgent care r/trumpvirus  also saw earlier, insane graph. Shows many states massive increase cases; going stop soon One former coworkers Cincinnati, like “don’t call southerner” clearly Kentucky type drawl coronavirus shown many weaknesses Americans American society. But, lesson lost. 

Fox News parents? Cable news shows came decades broadcast news conditioned Americans news could trusted. 

Back then, news items restricted time people wanted facts relevance news shows. Producers editors mingle news opinion.

Cable changed that. News became 24/7 opinion news gradually mingled. Americans watched cable realize happening. And, real experience telling fact fiction. 

And now, coronavirus pandemic locked whatever political leaning ""trusted"" news show. really can't imagine hospital crew working max load keep increasing two weeks, minimum. know. might quit.. Nobody said average. Roughly 30% US population.  CDC large nationwide serology studies ongoing speak. real number soon. I'm guessing nationwide average 5% ish. However, number vary greatly place place. NE cluster (NY, NJ, PA, MA, etc) 10%+, rest country 3% ish (IN 2.8%, LA county 2.1%, last sero-surveys), rapidly increasing. can't wait actual data. never even got first one  Back december came werid cold days walking past group people, one wearing mask.

That considered risky level exposure. need sustained contact, order 5-20 minutes sharing air, larger burst virus, like close-quarters cough. Tesla stock go bad news? really care products? Florida specific comfortably get.

But I'm pretty sure sufficient explanation 😭 Add funeral 6 people allowed hugs. brings home Denmark Norway fine, region Germany fine well. UK Sweden hand.. Sorry say grandparents likely survive Well make sense economically thousands free beds  mean bars open elective surgeries closed? We’re China, we’re Italy , we’re New York, I’m sure we’re houstalantavegas next Sounds like racist theory me. known breaks linked protest? Either BLM ones reopen ones?

I heard spikes either. 

Being outdoors seems really good thing. wonder political rallies move outside Cant lock people cages though? Like kids coming America? theyre biological domestic threat dont see big deal One important thing remember here: people high elevations appear less susceptible coronavirus. important pay it. Same, company laid anyone off, everyone working home. Literally nothing changed. even hired friend contract work look work elsewhere. Fucking Tromp! mean, chances reelection like 2% anyway. far bets paid well I'm one like listen dangerous i'm gonna listen. oncoming freight train, exit. know recently Tucker son heiress Swanson Enterprises, TV dinners company. family wealthy set life, yet spends lot time complaining elites. 16th fattest\* bound happen Florida too? course guess governor attempting tweak numbers make situation look better, gonna happen too 

does anyone database site tracks hospitalizations? tried looking found anything clear consistently updated article interesting look back presidents handled public health crises. Woodrow Wilson might failed handling, although arguably preoccupied War. Ya don’t say... Texas Medical Center one hospital. 20 different hospitals. Honestly, I'm trying hard still like Elon, he's amazing things, everyone likes him. there's this, everything he's done before. He's ruined reputation already. Yeah man unlimited beds doctors surge, big brain logic work Holy shit *puts away chips* People find local hospitals surge capacity New York City has.

These past two days hospital hell today started diverting ER cases. Yet PM hinted today briefing thinks keep [publishing daily Quebec, still significant number cases every single day significant number deaths every single day,” Trudeau said. “I certainly hope Premier Legault would continue transparent open Quebecers and, indeed, Canadians beginning.”

So we'll see do. Yes. likely point... borderline r/iamverysmart

No comment, yours. knew point meaning made still feel delineation needed. social security disability part social security. many days Texans infected? morbid...

But things get bad, atleast Undertaker onsite. enough people 65 start dying, maybe Americans start care. Houston takes lead, blow 4th quarter? they're pandering moron constituents they'll reelected. could drastically change course people would listen take proper precautions.. it’s proven effective world stage point Love book. really similar covid. SK even said March tweet don’t fucking complain! That’s chances take. Welcome reality!!!

Even force Tesla abide rules (which one, don’t even know fact Tesla breaking social distancing laws, 2 employees claiming), Tesla find another reason fire them. That’s life. squeaky wheel gets boot unfortunately Imagine guy... I'm 34 year old significant risk factors.

I'm good person.

And would prefer people try murder me.

Thank you. Great comment. Time bend make payment. State government. investigate doctors nurses. think significant transmission issue West. Public toilets likely riskier virus aerosolised dispersed around bathroom flushing UV would also thing open. Generally speaking though I'm sure agree bad idea defecate street and/or play random faeces find there, without COVID-19 thing.  threatened funding pulled federal government. Arg! Fucking stay home! feel like going take minimum 7 days count mailin ballots swing States  If? Bro, shut fuck down! Living Fresno county surprised amount people taking seriously including employer. Wait...flu season over...why covid19 still around? News air victims stories like this. people physically see, might change minds, esp air Dr fauci's words right story, instead narcissist's 'gut feeling's'.

Were part 'not fair make us stay home &amp; wear masks' group?

 Meanwhile high risk &amp; get go party party even shopping many keep distance cover face (even cough). like Freddy Krueger takes waking hours. 

Not fair us either people all, 'ah ain't nothin', bug. one said immune. said rare.

It's true there's gradient risk, smooth slope upward. slopes upward significantly quickly get advanced age.

This yet another case government agency muddying scientific knowledge worry people interpret wrong behave poorly. ultimately, degrades public trust government science. Sorry Nana, president says need economy Maybe lockdown creating backlog ""elective"" surgeries finally taken care of, would less ICU begin with. 70% occupants non-covid.

Lack medical experience disprove points make. like flu

Yes, everyone 70 actually least 2x less dangerous flu:

Flu IFR: 0.1-0.2%

[Covid IFR: 0.05% &lt; got fired first job vacation state person got flu. manager said, “What think I’m gonna it? Come **job** don’t expect one get back.”

And that. That’s true gives us clearer picture what’s going understand 3/4 patients ICU covid patients. 

My wife RN. major cities like Houston ICU capacity always issue. significant drop florida percent positive ( 15 percent 9; 50k tests)  people get diminished level care even technically enough beds? I'd guess now. happens officials say protests important pandemics. Turns Corona care politics. I'll praying everyone Texas. What's gonna give people take pandemic seriously. leaders incompetent people care. disappointing situation. Given two super powers, one clearly evil other, it’s important side correct one. it’s either sheep suck find new job guts stand what’s right. Ok. I'd swim lake Covid water vote malignant tumor spores Congress. never stopping virus. Lockdowns vaccine impractical. say masks curb it, can't even find buttholes resist. Oh talking nearing another peak?
Shit end week fine, open everything again.
They said peak guys, That’s matter opinion. interests besides sports last months felt incredibly empty without them. enjoy even I’m stressed worried something, there’s usually game distract myself. stressful time remember, it’s option. I’m sure there’s lot people feel same.

And that’s even going many people’s careers livelihoods depend functioning sports leagues. nothing empty talk. Public stand another lockdown. Remember soon federal unemployment likely end. People need money feed family, pay rent etc  I’d say hindsight 20/20 still middle doesnt make sense, US Europe supposed enough doses produced January. Unless he's talking rest world well America!

Fuck Yeah!

Coming save Mother Fucking day YEAH 
America, fuck yeah!

 
Freedom way, YEAH! source that? believe you, I'd like share info others. feel now? Hopefully decide self insure employment practices liability insurance like directors officers employees absolutely sue win. people realize even right work states, getting fired things like often result lawsuits damages paid out. biggie. Lt gov Dan Patrick suggested sacrifice elderly. open room. Well? country? What's relevance Ireland here? look neighboring countries Sweden. Wow, didn’t know get triggered personal easy 😂ok bro like saying lava hot stupid bullshit Better 30s Nah, think gonna supernatural heat wave. Cause know virus hates heat, hates humitidy. ain't seen hot till texas. Pay credit card, touch pen.

you mean pin, touching keypad? bar amounts generally well pin threshold? impression paying card safest way days. true. wiki page: better gives information combined statistical area population Greater Los Angeles (the CSA population one almost 19m).

You really want get pissing contest killed innocent civilians? Get clue, one baddie time. affect young people may wont die still get permanent lung damage. People don’t wanna wear masks, people don’t wanna quarantine. People won’t listen guess rather die. It’s fucking sad could avoided easily, hard part nearly impossible thing get infected. high risk stubborn morons decided make death political. That's opened did! alas. really dust storm, dust cloud (a particularly thick one), dissipated Sunday. *disappointed gif* I’m really sad frustrated reading this. live NYC. really hoping rest country would learn us. successes failures everyone see. Nobody go here. breaks heart. Today certain country 5th highest increase cases possibly highest increase per capita planet last 24 hours country even shown international news once. Guess one is. 5 8 states bottom 11 population density country. That's cherry picking bullshit. Pretty easy socially distance real metropolitan areas.

And Myrtle Beach, sc source major outbreak listed website? think Disney sending lawyers fans’ funerals verify? Elsewhere thread someone said surge capacity full 12 days without lot prevention measures. .. or, know.. die. I’m Anderson week confirm outside hospital it’s fucking bananas. Tons people scrubs wandering without masks. going hell time. I’ve used much sanitizer week hands starting crack lol. People extremely stubborn. ... maybe  upset Supreme Leader.
All Well.
We wrong.
Totally manageable surely recognise reductive argument. Capturing droplets mask lesser evil expelled air run exponentially higher risk infecting people. evidence anecdotal anymore, clear community transmission environments, mask wearing reliable way reduce R0. arguing sake arguing - surely greater good paramount. kid developed type 1 diabetes, presumably due COVID-19 infection. BG presentation 1500! Died days later vent. mother long term care nurse. Feel bad family, kid fat known health conditions aside obesity, passed one day never woke up. People try paint COVID-19 death chances recovery quite good infected. Look, I'm fan news channel. Heck, even watch news here. 

But comment comes across someone either wants downplay discredit something, type blasting Fox News 24/7. -- IMO already things. sauna incredible [health including activation [heat shock keep hoping proven benefit sauna re: COVID, addition already know immune function reduced risk viral infections. think vary country country depending virus weaponised.

For example, Tr\*mp R\*publican governors taken virus extremely seriously start US successful suppressing it, American situation would like one describe country (I'm assuming name German).

Strangely, see quite level polarisation terms response England, even though political discussion unfortunately become similar America's. Maybe I'm paying attention. without shutting down. 14th time?  Yes. does. means care lives others. basic definition good person.

If refuse wear mask clearly care yourself. basic definition bad person. What's point? average age dead less countries. ICU 100% full, critical patients diseases/problems can’t access care need. 

It really doesn’t matter kind patient filling ICU, they’re full. Good news. Texas learning hard way appears. many go restroom wash hands? many go blow nose leave shit floor bins? many go swish mouths spit sinks? great Pablo Picasso War one people. admit mainly looking NJ bubble, it’s continued go despite soft re-opening.

I understand people sub talking places like Texas/Florida everything fully open, yeah obviously spiked.

But point still stands, re-opening done correctly clearly working. Big travel hubs get effected most, including cumulative deaths. 
 That's epidemiology 101. can't prevent outbreaks, control turn curve back towards 0. NY that. states mask haven't. flat best, skyrocketing cases. wonder it'll one two decades till there'll ""refurbished"" EVs 10k... Thots playas. ~~We~~ political leaders chose to.

FTFY guess forgot things Bill Gates 90s PR changed image heavily people see good. I'd say Jeff Bezos worst billionaire billionaire club. critical patients (who straddling line life death) typically ICU 2-3 weeks round corner get better, die. There’s likely fair bit patients admitted ICU small hump get transferred lower acuity unit monitoring. average slightly moderately lower 2-3 weeks, that’s including people need ICU treatment (car wrecks, sepsis, heart attack, stroke, many things). 

Also, ICU requires overflow units, hospital three choices: hire travelers much higher wage, give overtime current ICU staff indefinitely, recruit nurses/staff *untrained* ICU setting. New York saw three choices used time, cases still wasn’t enough. I’m nurse Florida I’m fucking terrified. kept weeks. Much efficient.  Celebrating 4th July honestly feels grotesque right now. July 4th independence day, celebrating always linked celebrating country itself. one celebrating America right now. ashamed country. point, though, politician adults job protect people unnecessary harm. Would acceptable approaching hurricane? Would acceptable anyone position responsibility people’s lives? Abbot say survivors died? people antsy needed party get haircut, took priority preventing people dying, people getting sick bars, restaurants salon. helping economy creating second peak first wave. rate, actual 2nd wave e like third peak first wave. I’d personally attempt rotate least 5 masks. Maaaaybe 3.

Texas WAY fatter Colorado. that's Colorado active state many outdoor things do. Texas LOT flat land, especially hellscape Western Texas. never understood love guy, always looked like self-centered man-child asshole me. heard many bad stories working Tesla many communications Eleon cringe worthy. want respect proper quarantine procedure suprise slightest, goes well pseudo-rebellious attitude. begining pandemic part people saying experts predictions wrong way overblown. governor say grandparents would sacrificed economy? 85 hospitals Houston area 19,300 beds, including TMC. facilities employ 100,000 health care professionals, almost seven percent Houston-area workforce. lol South Africa news short months. one single absurd lockdown opening strategies country planet. explosive exponential growth right government sent kids back school, resumed public transport opening places business gathering restaurant hair salons. also extremely arrogant ignorant populace gives USA freedumb crowd run money. province deaths cases stopped testing people 55 unless severely sick. testing joke sitting massive backlogs test shortages. top also apparently massive death reporting problem countless deaths accurately attributed virus abysmal public health sector corrupt useless. government population shit bed bad Brazil. Y'all might get lot news us there's storm brewing make global headlines soon enough. Dave Mustaine said best: "" *Hindsight* always 20/20, looking back still bit fuzzy"" experts said outset lockdown manageable cases would could happen.

Then happened. I'd argue way intrusive asking people wear masks.

But muh freedumbz.... One friends boat. pediatricians actually seem problems ... least compared dermatologists working next them, mostly pork seems protecting people calling bad practices work conditions, calling work. family currently invited 4 California, 2 Utah, family towns party straight week catching old birthdays. includes grandparents aunts uncles old preexisting conditions. I’ve tried tell insane one listen me. 

I got tested days came urged still waiting results can’t believe you’d reunion way things right now. Outside instead inside, require masks eating, way wash hands outside preferably, lots hand sanitizer available, open meal serving people serve like buffet. Pre-plate. ElOn gOoD gUy. literally need reason. sounds like big companies. Masks little nothing contracting virus, LOT SPREADING others. Azealia right! bet Grimes really smell like roll nickels too. Here's fact: dumbass protestors causing new spike. fit worldview? “Sorry love guys care well being. bad.” Believe?

How about.. Americans know protests large political gatherings spread covid-19.

It's beyond doubt now. Close human contact (and animals) spreads covid-19 fucking highly contagious virus. True, New Zealand pretty well. LOL really wild uncomfortable people reality situation.

I appreciate offering solidarity.

I get desire want normalcy hospital officially diverting emergency room cases last two days hell hospital. Contact tracing bread butter prevention mode. Lockdowns mitigation. won’t able prevention without contact tracing unless vaccine.

We also really don’t know well community masks particular work Antibodies last three months, many aspects immunity beyond antibodies, don’t let news scare you! Sports venue management tons employees lost jobs COVID. one got furloughed. Don’t get wrong agree isn’t biggest problem saddens venture industry +10 years venture something else. happens people think prudent virus response somehow ideological debate, thus decisions based prioritizing family safety instead become decisions based ""proving"" something.

The problem is, prove side right again, side medical epidemiological consensus. According self-reported data CDC’s website. looks like population Texas prevalence 34.8% obesity New York 27.6%

All states 20%, south Midwest far worst. rare autoimmune disorder/periodic fever syndrome called adult onset still's disease. Although take med cocktail (including two drugs tested covid19), Still's nonremitting active, every day 15 years I've spiking fevers, chills, sore throat, muscle fatigue, joint pain. Sometimes attacks organs. leaves susceptible pneumonia.

Hearing stories long term covid problems eerily familiar others Still's. disease considered 'cytokine storm'--also parallel Covid. Luckily get bloodclots!

Also interesting--everyone know Still's caught Covid, even comorbidities heavy immunosuppression, mild form virus. Maybe bodies already heightened immune response state?

I hope recover soon! he, rallies, sudden announcement reduce test sites need warrior waivers. lots beautiful tests - wants himself. Insert FINE meme. looooads different problems truely starts escalate.

Thing is: TMC reports 100% ICU usage actual Covid occupancy rate ICUs much lower, around 30% less. least now.

But rising.

Which means cancelled elective procedures, still bit buffer. Personel freed available covid stuff, usually takes time manpower. 

The true problem starts Covid occupies vast majority ICU needs beyond.

Covid patients take personel time, nurse suddenly starts care 5 ICU patients, staff running low key personel like anesthetist, Covid patients start use medical material like propofol, oxygen tanks etc.

There still people heart attacks, still people getting accidents, people seizures etc. everyone occupied caring covid patients, going heart attacks?

Which starts spill to: hospitals full. need arrange transportation hospitalized patients across huge area. France, started using high speed trains distribute non-critical covid patients certain regions got desperate. Agreed, *easier* hate them. However, virus give rats ass grouped up. going spread whether people protesting peace haircut. 

Mobility places returned pre-covid levels. Even post literally says opposite claim. People stopped distancing going counties \*even did\*.

As week June 15th, worst affected states back levels pandemic hit. someone rounded multidisciplinary team comprised med students, residents, attending physicians, would disagree fine. Critical care extremely complex, admitted single disease state manage cases. countries existed. could compare US's response them, adjust response needed. shame, really. days though state they’re near capacity already? Texas children’s started take adults. ~~THREE THOUSAND~~ bed hospital article says comparing 2 sets Data, Data sweden one extra month. yet people ignoring reason push discourse. DeSantis anything. leaving counties make rules masks social distancing pass ordinances say idea. Despite reaching surge capacity, four hospital CEOs said Thursday there's cause ""unwarranted alarm.""

Don't worry tsunami. reading Bahamas, like many places, requiring negative virus test entry. 

Most places saying 'within past 72 hours' seems like leaves fair bit time get infected, testing takes time scheduling. Bahamas saying negative test 'within past 10 days.' seems like ***eternity*** person could get infected test!

I assume cruise business. 7-day cruise, since Bahamas close US ships usually stop day 2 day 7. going get cruise traffic require negative test 72 hours advance unless first stop, ship administers certifies them.

Seems like theater. is, indeed. holy shit country insane. want freedom infect someone disease. Asheville checking in, people wearing mask Reminder Houston 4th largest city USA.  dire. means get accident heart attack lying hallway hope best.  ""Sir need order pipe unio-""
""You're fired"" government told us months wear them. ""Jump!"" Texas going 3rd country soon. would consistent IFR around 0.6%. Yeah, point think we're gonna go pray best. feel like anxiety continuing wait might worse. wish guys best luck healthy pregnancy!!! math way off. city NY around 8-9 million people. You’re thinking whole state (about 20 million). 

But yes, borough individual county. Exactly. idea take precautions collective society, protect thing best can. would slow spread drastically. “over zealous” protection don’t get it, signal right thing. Problem people don’t seem understand would feel like “it’s waste time.” It’s like wearing seatbelt. won’t totally prevent dying cases, get accident, chances survival rise quite bit. like someone never major collision minor collisions saying “why would wear seat belt? pointless.” People frustrating. submission removed because

More like meric aaaaahhhhh!!!! plausible, something take serious account number actual deaths Covid 19 likely 1.5-2x times higher confirmed number deaths, more. look CDC data excess pneumonia deaths Feb. 1 May 31st alone. believe 77,000+, almost likely Covid. look recent serology study Belgium, pointed IFR around 1.4%. higher countries, Belgium really European country count confirmed PCR testing, suspected deaths due Covid statistics. Pretty sure cart horse, current events gauge. QUESTION SERVING FOOD OUTDOOR EVENT

We organizing small event friend's house need feed people. wondering best practices this. Ontario, Canada allowed small outdoor gatherings.

Right choices individual pre-packaged meals everyone, buffet style table servers handling serving utensils.

We hand sanitizer hand everyone, masks/gloves servers (if go way). also enforce social distancing guests getting food either way.

Remember outdoors.

Any tips recommendations much appreciated. Thank you. presume probably suspension elective surgeries rerouting hospital beds ICU units. perhaps overforecasted burden hospital system always distinct possibility. good news surge manageable, know posts negative. catch flies dead bodies honey. least Kroger unionized. tried bomb problem. (Just watched space force) end soon right? mean assholes can’t win right?  fucking lame childish. shame Check flu deaths, car accidents, heart disease, suicides, literally type death. Keep hiding closets called like is

""Oh, lying. lying could show me. Mad I'm calling liar? show one link talking about. won't? liar then, fucking moron. Lol desperate.""

This conversations people go. Stop entertaining pretending reasoned with. mocked every way, shape, form shamed back corners silent like Trump.

Then keep silent eventually die mortality. That's proper way handle this. Look original reports German. werent asymptomatic, undiagnosed. Lot report typical symptoms like anosmia.

Y can't journalists work properly? Interestingly enough, actually happened protesters wearing masks...

Masks work! listened one doctors interviewed KNX news radio (not talk radio) today said dose using half therapeutic dose cancer patients. doubt unmodified X-Ray machine would work.

Also, treating seriously ill pneumonia patients hospital, doctors office.

Educate yourself. Here’s BS graphic passed around: doubt anyone gets 95% clean wipe themselves. Yea eating wearing masks hugged good bye end :(

Yikes. 

TBH I'd wager odds immuno-compromised BF getting sick COVID-19 event pretty slim, there's really way sure unless wait couple weeks get tested. Good luck! Oh believe me, fox news manufacture something September/October scare viewers voting deaths. Surely Disney World next. can’t imagine Disney would permit Disney World open deciding keep Disneyland closed indefinitely. remember media talking COVID-19 baby boom babies called Quaranteens someday. stupid. Demographers actually studied happens birth rates disasters almost always drop. needs thing called “GoFuckMe” assholes like this, also pay hospital bills everyone infected give zero F's why, political sides playing ability. One party nothing, party allowing it. also attach even money ridiculous things, instead giving money people need sides. know what? I'll accept it. deal defanged COVID-19 gives small cough days - can't deal something might give permanent lung damage. learned nothing. Thanks. mess Tell people got hours cut couldn’t collect unemployment. Better yet, tell people applied unemployment sitting around desperate income last months system completely unprepared handle situation. Complete lie ass Judging past, would dressing black, making throat slashing gesture using creepy voice say ""Rest Peace"".

Social distancing proper hand washing, mask wearing etc. successful without all-out lockdown know people would absolutely pay Disney funeral financially stop increase cases? going enforce mask wearing afraid muh freedoms Americas nearly 50 percent COVID-19 cases. I'm pretty sure herd immunity real possibility, second wave hits place like NYC big uptick opening think possible. level distancing protection measures contact tracing likely lower threshold herd immunity. think south west many infectable folks basically back March levels protections. know sidebar, 🗣️ CDC please test tissue samples fourth quarter 2019. started elective surgeries again? Yeah.
We got 6,100+ cases Texas today. county. county ~100 cases ~80 recovered ~20 still sick. 0 Deaths. Neighboring counties similar, 8 closest counties mine together 7 confirmed deaths, 3 counties.

These numbers barely budged since lifted restrictions month ago. . second lockdown choice print money purge. whole country looted burned. government forces company lay take care financially time inclined join hooligans. know money really going. probably happen people fall behind payments government give tax dollars banks instead giving back people.  sounds similar witch hunts, villagers coming pitch forks condemning doctor burned stake practicing dark magic... seem like according infection rates usage word 'mandatory' wrong. is, thanks. Positivity make true, realistic helps confront possibility worse case appropriately.  Might still funny - take get days Put side side accumulated wealth Brazil’s deaths continued worst. Well 200k deaths sounds like lot, still far fewer living days stolen Americans motor vehicle accidents, us willing take risk something trivial ice cream. even spread way herd immunity threshold, still wouldn’t likely steal much life motor vehicle accidents time took get there, would slow lot. yes, it’s dangerous, constantly accepting risk trade-offs actually live ljves have. Take reasonable precautions, don’t panic put important things life hold. Justice never smart man. Hes done nothing positive state get go rednecks fuxjing love toadboy I’m hairstylist Massachusetts announced phase 1 reopening, thought hearing things. 

The irony wasn’t allowed physically enter store buy hair color social distancing. allowed apply peoples heads. wondering groups add 100% don't. Donald attorney general deal Many things different. Compliance seems higher Bay LA, people vacationing LA, restaurants open LA, larger protests LA. I’m Berkeley currently couple restaurants outdoor dining here, meanwhile Facebook feed filled photos SoCal friends going eat every night different bar restaurant (some packed). first time since 1994 World Series could happen. oh starts. I'm sure politically motivated. literally way minimize death. Sounds similar friends Florida.

There pressure trace contacts, test. run around finding someone test u. u test positive tell u stsy home 10 days... symptoms go back normal. least test 10 days.... RIGHT?! Seriously, I’d worried *surgeon* disregarded importance masks. practice sterile protocols surgeries? med student, every surgery scrubbed strictly enforced PPE usage. seen people told leave re-scrub hands left sterile field. Stop ride want get logic everyone flyover states move get paid better need extra money.

Someone making $125,000 coastal city standard living someone making $50,000-$60,000 year midwest south.

FYI - live ""flyover state"" life. look around me. However, lived east coast several years know costs are. I'm sneering, stating facts. Taiwan #1! Fuck China! get time next year, would consider exceptionally fast. opposite actually true Maryland ? Well Texas, Florida, Arizona California opened we’re gonna straight records weeks. 

Yikes America car problems best solution turn check engine light. “It’s HOAX” Yep. mean reference people skeptical success believing news countries somehow faked. It’s North Korea... people china families countries regularly talk to. CT, MA, NJ, NY worked less sin sync whole thing shows now. I'm CT 95% people still wearing masks everywhere. They're even hard find now. Home Depot pallet them. believe states going require quarantine travelers hot spot areas, too. all, I'm pretty happy New England right now. Probably not. earliest could available goes perfectly September typical college student likely nearly last line get it. first doses likely go health care providers, followed people long term care (provided vaccine efficacy elderly), followed older sicker adults, followed young healthy population. lot minimize processing distribution time vaccine, given many colleges start August, hard imagine happening good chunk fall term already elapsed. Holy shit! Cases spiked Costa Rica deaths probably rise 100-200 July.  Americans find something blame it, comes surprise. Wake god’s sake. It’s entirely guys handled pandemic. Personal responsibility conditioned systemically mandated obligations fellow citizens. It’s culture care nurtured act leadership suddenly absent. I’d place priority blaming system governance blaming neighbor.  People married worse great albeit fake reason. said. Internet archive friend. live LA. I've read part increased in-home social gatherings since re-opening. people see wear masks, noticed people less people wearing since Newsom's order. city full deniers, although take seriously enough. yeah sucks LA happening like this, I've seen people trying cool following guidelines not, huge city county 10 million. “We’re testing much!” Yea eating wearing masks hugged good bye end :( That’s worked. banks give bonds fed exchange cash. Nobody got free money. headlines misleading. Good job Mother Russia eased social distancing 75th anniversary Victory Day. ABQ unfortunately seems less cooperative wearing masks lot state... still lot people wearing them, 90-100% like Santa Fe, Taos, Los Alamos, northern part state. think cases eventually rise again. huge!!!

Now R’s follow!!!

Praise be. agree, saw Texas huge spikes. feel like country getting hit worst divided timing social events. Troll? looked profile. Something definitely wrong you. Good luck. I'm 100% straight male, unfortunately me. 

However mean marriage can't faked lol I’m assuming Disney World next. There’s way Disney would indefinitely delay reopening Disneyland open Disney World weeks, especially given coronavirus situation bad Florida. 1 3 years normally.  Well doesnt say texas fucked dont know helps, right mask, don't. that, social distance shelter home. Fuck shit. Brazil soon reach 200,000 deaths COVID-19 mid-July. Hoping US slow death rates. Reasonable accomodations... i.e. to-go/ take out. law suit. anyone true medical condition trying get covid staying home. It'd funny companies owner.

Anyway, according article got info, *""far-UVC light (207–222 nm) efficiently kills pathogens potentially without harm exposed human tissues.""*

It looks like need special glasses They’d deem unconstitutional. 

You wear pants life-saving face wear. hoping find work see normalcy 2nd half 2020. guess time get used idea home unemployed while. stay safe two family members who’ve died far

Anecdotal, clouds clarifies. I've three male members (genetically related) died prostate cancer, I'm high risk category that. Oh, wait, evidently 80% men die prostate cancer, prostate cancer. Also, died late 80's, good run life. 

I'm afraid statistics Covid19 equally murky, relatives die Covid19? Age, preexisting conditions, general immune system healthiness, BMI?

Not much ass, sorry, statistics help lot. Saying healthy people die, too, really case. Japan, far, one person age 30 died Covid19, heart condition. So, really, zero healthy people. Yes, get people dying, people dying homelessness drug addiction, too. People die cancer, obesity, dementia. mom died dementia recently, guess that's another risk have. good way go out. Forgetting son looks like. Forgetting use toilet. Forgetting hold pen.

Life full risks rewards. Stay safe, also live life. scared hikikomori living. lucky get 80 years rock space. Use time well. Houston Dallas 3 hour drive, get you’re saying. President receives compensation services, rendered Chief Executive Nation, individual parts duties. part compensation paid sums appropriated military naval forces; equally clear Constitution President’s duties Commander Chief represent part duties ex officio Chief Executive [Article II, sections 2 3 Constitution] latter’s office civil office. [Article II, section 1 Constitution . . . . ] President enlist in, inducted drafted into, armed forces. Nor, subject court-martial military discipline. contrary, Article II, section 4 Constitution provides ‘The President, [Vice President] Civil Officers United States shall removed Office Impeachment for, Conviction Treason, Bribery high Crimes Misdemeanors.’ 

This means president must wear mask. read “washing car crash” also feels appropriate. people believe set fuckin nwo. Legit... sucks. many bus drivers contracted covid. scary. “Types” 

Translation: “phonesoap” gadget bought ain’t gonna work. practices abhorrent yeah. yes bound happen somewhere. numbers say spike ""unsustainable"" 12 days, unless something changes. Whatever means. Classic Elon jerk wad Hang on, 81% people may level immunity? reading right? cases increasing deaths aren’t anywhere close couple months ago seeing 35k new cases? (USA).

Ratio used something like 35k new cases 1500 new deaths. right, 10% better every quarter must 10% better base 100% also accumulated gains already made. example 100+10%= 110 first quarter *on top number another 10% next quarter* giving 110+10%=121. reaaaaally accumulates time. Seriously. One time old job, week really bad flu (way pandemic), still well within sick days, even gave hard time basically forced work projects home. felt like dying, thanks, guess?  Psssst... binary separation happened 2 options next presidential election. Voters pick side, compromise two. Except live it, lot Americans die. something White House understand care? Turn in. Stealing deal parents identity common one too. Especially comes pension. true Texas general think. Especially tollways. actually kind liked lived there. good thing aggressive drivers actually driving car paying attention. Nobody wants exchange paint want beat next corner. like mini F1 race miserable stop go traffic. Shoulda worn masks try sue state impeaching freedom. fun Texas! Need clarity, political posts relating Corona removed? political posts unrelated Corona ? could understand latter, former. Meanwhile, today Texas Attorney General filed end access Affordable Care Act. pandemic. 2,200 Texans died, cases IDK research used North east lowest infection rate atm. lockdown vested interests seeing company responsible 60% electric cars sales US failing 

News propaganda, say don’t say managed specific interests Source comment thread. Looking information states contrary give elderly family members.

Edit: Harvard source says 10 days symptoms Easy get away area people desperate jobs too.

""Welp, replacement within hour."" told quit. HEY! PA coalition also trending right direction. Governor Health Secretary deserve tons credit.

Very, very, frustrating watch parts country use time prepare fact anti-prepare. went LOT shit part country.

Suffice say none changed south backwards narrative here. People statistics, game. reality, people use agency influence outcome. 

Stop dis-empowering people trying get think nothing helpless statistics. HF GG Consumer demand return virus gone, way around it. That's hopefully good Respiratory Therapists. Plain &amp; simple.
GENOCIDE

We need protect . someone care ,or OTHERS= STAY AWAY. #covidstayneg Breathing well average defined 100, that's bad. Places general within 5% means really concentration dumb-ness necessarily.

I'd probably place blame sort stubbornness refusal reason rather lack general problem solving skills (which imo IQ measures). rural cities fine Damn, need intervention like, yesterday. well northeast put measures place contain virus. gone seriously reduced new cases deaths, like Europe. People going back work living level normalcy social distancing wearing masks. rest country can't follow done, idea. Really? that's case, measures successful ish? Again, know sounds like I'm douchey socratic thing I'm trying figure endgame us. Like trying get covid die linear growth rather exponential growth? trying continue keeping hospitals getting overrun? feasible get covid all, long term? goal? pessimism younger people take longer get worse shape... least that’s I’ve seen anecdotal information Italy China. Anybody remember smart phone footage Wuhan back January ran ICU beds? That's good way get fist face. Caring covid patients pretty straightforward. really need specialist, although students familiar ICUs operate.

Put line fluids, prone them, intubate, ventilate, wait.

It's pretty easy tell patient going make not. start see gradual improvement lung function day-over-day.

For patients improving put ECMO, probably 20 machine (tops) med center surge capacity reached likely use COVID patients longer (based familiarity hospital surge response plans). tier-one trauma centers 8 fewer. yes. Congrats that’s awesome Hard live something everyone's dying lockdown absolutely effective shall soon see. aftermath may actually still turn economically boost kill bunch elderly people due longer needing pay hundreds thousands social security Medicare payments. exactly comforting thought though. LA, right  Saw coming? Everything seems fine /s like joke project managers expecting 9 women get pregnancy done month, except vaccines. fair may realized infected. Still though, going awhile spend amount time bar business matter. sucks wife 7th anniversary coming days. Oh no, absolutely know will. people would helped comment write donation checks call made say ""Fuck them"". :/ Lowe's HR manager legit spoke first day ignore anyone coming ""soliciting"" union ""you allowed talk me, they'd middleman."" fresh college idea talking ""union."" Lol 
I meant reply comment *you* replied to.

I agree both, btw, need get defensive.

Still, believe reminder take care always considered valid input conversations. [You need shutdown, opentable data houston shows restaurant walkins reservations cratering back lockdown texas accomplished nothing means cancer patients won’t able get surgeries needed would know.. reals learned mistakes instead ignoring them. Yes, know I'm positive might sure. guarantee might though. Wish naive boggles mind. Literally least essential business think caters people vices like drinking smoking make higher risk.

After we've gotten back semblance normalcy, officials let happen need prosecuted. I'm worried July-August well tourism, far general things working far identifying controlling outbreaks go, people start travelling around vacation going much harder. really hope get control again. Hey! plan pray, too! haven’t found any, protests across world. articles talking protestors covid, waking symptoms hours protests. Meaning, probably got standing line sandwich shop 5 days protest that’s sensational Hi, totally get regard grokking visual information. similar issue due visually impaired. Unfortunately, graph load me. Screenshot maybe? Even ""excessive death"" statistics difficult draw correlations from. Also... gave scientists time find treatments work. Even cases climbing, mortality rate high doctors better options sticking everyone ventilator. Lockdown worked — flattened curve long enough increase hospital surge capacity (and body bag supplies). achievements, “we” risk higher rates infection. Continued social distancing, sheltering place, wearing masks absolutely necessary prevent spread it’s apparently everyone’s individual discretion. Choose wisely. Bunker boy even want fund research is. I'm sick crap lol. feel like constantly toyed months end. gaslighting finest. math way off. city NY around 8-9 million people. You’re thinking whole state (about 20 million).

The city Los Angeles 4M, city NY mandated mask wearing yet? Cause, that's important thing slowing down.  Gotta take break then, weekends mostly bury single player video game smoke lot weed. Gotta decompression time.

Stay safe there. local fireworks display still planning move forward. They're saying ""socially distanced"" still going nightmare. Communication isn’t really issue, they’ve told. Lots times. Enforcement issue. people receive fines wearing mask, like smoking seatbelts, they’ll keep selfish fools. know, people often say praise saying “a prophet” predicted this, fact, anti-science mentality America common thing back then. never cared address issues, laughed let fester. now. Virus loves party. know FLA fly problem. “It’s hoax make president look bad!” -My Facebook feed since pandemic began 🙄 Kinky! Subreddit mods Reddit admins. far it.

Mods enforce (or don't) whatever arbitrary rules set sub try herd cats abiding reddits terms, risk admins banning sub.

Admins nothing, unless potentially puts legal jeopardy (i.e. exchanging provocative pictures minors pirated content). even then, itd caught enough.

ETA: important thing remember admins get paid 6 figure salaries nothing, mods get paid nothing all. I’m glad protests least I'm aware implications, discussing those. K? serious? Lol 600,000 people still go restaurants outside without worry anything fight people believe whole thing hoax lmao even get started numbers like death rate, infections per 100k people, daily cases etc etc etc. it’s preventive measure don’t order dozens refrigerating trucks prevent corpse rotting. Covid likely third leading cause death US heart attacks cancer year. Oh well, guess we’re gonna die district provides chromebooks internet hotspots every child first point apply.  Also, rural district coverage works everywhere. family looks like grapevine... Elon Musk: shittiest piece shit ever shat think meant CRNP, CNA? area Certified Nursing Assistants. feed people, roll bed, change diapers, help basic life needs. incredibly experienced act nurses’ front line, wouldn’t want touching vent settings. CRNP holds Masters usually specializes skill area. Florida Texas New York hold beer. No, merely result testing hospitalization rates would going up.  Yep. guaranteed 2 week rises cases 4 week rises deaths. 

The highest death rate country state New York, 1 death every 600 people. AFAIK, total true infection rate NY somewhere 10-30%. means around 2-6X deaths NY herd immunity. Texas 1 death per every 12,500 people. means Texas \~20x current death totals rate NY.

Things get LOT worse Texas, rest US. entitlement people shocking. business private entity, people absolutely right access, business owners every right world deny anyone want, reason want.

Can't grocery shopping want wear mask? Guess whose fault children get food. Hint: store! Probably locusts well, right? thing done months ago. Strict lockdown nationwide six weeks. Contact trace contact trace contact trace re-open nationwide. six weeks everyone either dead recovered, virus dead surfaces. small pockets still exist isolated. Again, NY got hit first international flights Europe/China coming in, thousands individual clusters pop overtop capacity medical system, doctors figured better strategies like splitting ventilators using steroids worst patients.

Why places shitty compliance big population centers worse current 7-day-average deaths per 1,000,000 NY (and lot worse include excess mortality including pneumonia deaths?) used old data. conflicting data. Old data. Old, data, data that's definitely pining fjords. data cited climbed curtain joined choir invisible. ex-data. fudging numbers still recording 5k cases per day. Imagine real jumbers... mean, pathological liars do. made living snake oil salesman liar. else expect? CA: Hold cosmo. good job texas! it! wouldn’t go protest personally. think lot spread people going normal lives, hanging family, parties etc. got invited bridal shower wedding summer. Actually, lot articles reading medical professionals seemed argue opposite problem. you’re poorly ventilated room bigger risk Covid19 literally stay air come contact large cluster it

If you’re well ventilated, open area, virus less likely hang air, likely diluted point innocuous People still saying plenty hospital beds even this! think saw 95% CI misinterpreted that...with median incubation period 5.1 days 97.5% showing symptoms day 11..it’s likely lower 90-95% significantly. Oh, sure. I’ve reading stuff local subs nurses saying excess patients die they’re getting care need. Lol Alameda County well unfortunately.

I'm seeing hospitalizations happening. ambulances pulling houses.

It's really getting rough. way ICU supposed months ago media said never happened. Hospitals empty world.
But point saying censored reddit. wonder long comments taken support mainstream narrative/agenda could blame her? probably cheating second wife. massive BLM protests Europe, quite violent (Paris, London). anyone know often hospitals go surge capacity? unsustainable surge capacity? hospital system big?

It definitely seems scary I'm trying downplay huge red flag what's come, idea often happens since we're always looking it. That's dumbest shit I've ever heard.

Please misunderstand - tragedy highest order really, REALLY hope things improve get worse. was, however, brought sheer incompetence.

Make sure leaders held accountable - care political stripe. data seems suggest otherwise re: protests. rate protestors getting Covid roughly general population, actually good otherwise would caused spikes pretty much every state.

Philly secede protect citizens human rights abuses United States. action, inaction, Trump basically mass murderer point. Meh. Don’t get wrong, COVID-19 huge threat bad thing, King come said virus nowhere near threat read “The Stand”. Basically bad thing is, could lot worse. 

That doesn’t mean relax ignore threat COVID-19, means severity doesn’t match threat came King’s fictional novel. COVID-19 real life though, please start wearing damn mask taking thing seriously better  still good, hit total normal capacity.

Check *•.¸♡ ᎮᎧᎮፈᎧᏒᏁ ♡¸.•* (@38O9127469): Governor Lamont, done well now, kind throwing lap towns cities. ""You're going open, good luck safe.""

The article mentions safety protocols may cost towns millions dollars. schools CT funded mix local property tax state grants. Towns cities scrambling make ends meet, somehow expected come huge amounts make schooling work.

Our budgeting process happens spring, town budgets next year already voted committed. knowledge there's system deal emergency expenses like this.

I think social political pressure big say actually happens. tension safety economy palpable New England, wearing mask big deal. easily butterfly effect events something extremely horrible like dead bodies streets.  lots people Sacramento glare say delightful crappy comments wearing one. Yikes. Yeah, too. say though last couple shows whiny though. Thursday, Kudlow also said administration respond rising numbers encouraging another nationwide lockdown, speaks motive downplaying pandemic—namely, believes it’s job advance interests “the economy” defined short-term top-line indicators, damaged businesses close.  
 
So basically, saying interested economy people deal it! die that’s ok - working economy! wrong people? Really Trump states. Fuck em. Outright malevolence There’s little evidence, we’re midst uncharted territory think cost/benefit clearly leans exposing people, even lessened risk, unnecessarily Like told you, even places required lockdown things places lockdown precautionary measures I'd still get cause resale value good, OTA, standard Autopilot, upcoming million mile battery, status since currently iPhone car world people look car. threshold obesity concern lowered body mass index 40 30.

That's big shift. supposed sell cars buy back? sound energy efficient. No, fire anybody. I'm kind guy put someone job want look good people reddit. Lock time disability makes can’t wear mask may ask? Yes, literally said disagree facts it. far 356 people died Harris County 3.4 million. Per video, 28% COVID-19, already 72% capacity without pandemic. normal percentage time year hospital? Seems awfully high.  No, accurate. Fear kills economies. Fear exactly happens hospitals become overloaded people start seeing people around start dying. People fear virus, ergo, virus killing economy. year 2020 would likely fine economically without SARS-CoV-2. Oh look, straw man Interstate travel protected constitution Exactly, fucking deadly disease. fuck see irony/fucked up'ness telling people learn live deadly disease?

The widespread existence long-term debilitations continues long anecdote short science. ask, many fucking times see scenario play dipshits stop blowing off. 

""it's 26% covid patients"" Yes, critical cases lag 12 days behind cases deaths lag 15-18 days behind cases. houston area, halted growth new infections instant, would still exceed ICU capacity within next 1-2 weeks long virus takes incubate &amp; hit severe status. 

we saw play NY, China, Italy, UK, etc. many times see exact scenario play get it? willful ignorance? trying find coping mechanism stressful? dreading fact ""evil liberals"" might right? Dreading Trump fucked might admit it? 

I get it. wish did, understand fucking thick headed stuff. 

We're seeing spike initial re-opening, another 5-12 days we're going start adding protest cases top that. many excess deaths ...it sure shit isn’t 130k Covid 5% excess deaths total year far. go look state notice every area that's moderate large covid outbreaks 105-120 range, everyone else around high 80s mid 90s. So, roughly 15-30% deaths usual, vast majority going covid. easily 130k likely closer 150k bad states counting deaths properly. I'm sure African warlords hoarding food would love ""organizational outreach."" may even repay ~~child slave labor~~ free workers.

Yeah no, ain't it, chief. Well get deserve life. one could seen coming! Houston many hospitals, along state's largest, surrounding areas own. SETRAC dashboard see exactly many beds occupied county, believe update daily. wild - like disease actively culling people listen infectious disease experts. 

Is one ways things get less virulent time? people reckless catch first, spread amongst other, % die off, survivors social networks traumatized object lesson?

Because could see ripped thru ""just flu NBD"" population, future waves would less severe - Can't catch coronavirus already dead coronavirus. everyone wear mask catches either dies recovers, kind takes care failure wear mask, right? basically herd immunity idiots need it? way ICU supposed months ago media said never happened.

because places closed stayed home places open are. virus, someone beat 21? think Italy shut fairly quickly right? Chinese shutdown came 2~3 wks, Italian shutdown came roughly time no？ Feb 20th sure local transmission March 8th beginning became national lock-down, roughly 16 days? think anyone capable immediate shutdown, even China. Chinese shutdown came 23rd, roughly 24 days initial local transmission. Stop dude. misrepresented data, misrepresenting correct data. Everyone see done. Gaslighting us cool. Actually Americans act like team time. issue two teams, literally like religion days. Hive mentality strong ever. wish wish they'd report percentages, silly. pretty sure death rates mostly going people getting tested now. Therefore young asymptomatic people active cases would never spotted April. already working setting temporary capacity outdoors repurposed commercial buildings? Common can’t assume listen scientific evidence fearless leader! even said knows doctors. hate seeing people suffer hopefully people take notice isn’t joke, isn’t politics, isn’t going end own! people hiding downplaying severity need held accountable. Store every comment statement made idiots held words. thing self-made billionaire. blood money It’s infuriating even /s … going say, acknowledged months IFR likely 1%. it?

I mean, last time full?? 

I'd take warning, still hospitals left, reason worry, right? Sounds like Houston use hospital ship NYC get utilize... infected, even won’t kill you, recovery period rough. feel like shit long period time don’t want happen. Neither death pain friends. I've look guy wrote article. Seems tad bias towards hating Elon. done single positive Musk related story looks things. I'm literally Instagram argument anti-mask, science denier write this. I've provided 11 scientific URLs (in Instagram ffs) citing benefits wearing mask. asked provide links supporting opinion. response? ""It takes 5 secs Google bro."" We're doomed.... Hey Gov. Abbott, 

Why guys shut again? live Oregon, brother goes school Texas. worried brother going back. Gov. Abbot making confident brothers safety short sighted leadership.  NEED brain computer interfaces ASAP. society crumble don't. ""Yeah, sure, couple hundred thousand people die,"" goes thinking, ""and yes many survivors crippled. That's tough. hey, stock market great!"" every news report heard today large potential increase actual number infections made one comment impacts death rate Panic associated. logical conclusion first things mouth like they're trying hide it. yes take seriously wear mask best social distance I'm raging lunatic think absolutely need pay attention facts math science.  Trump gets reelected live Nation Imbeciles. Oh, forgot, live Nation Imbeciles. guarantee complacent, even smidge. stop New York man. Take New Jersey, California Illinois it. Boom!

Love taking vacations really want sound like I'm attacking you, ""lockdown skeptics"" still problem. first ""lockdown"" hampered cut short folks like economic damage lockdown none benefits. wasted folks got uppity haircuts still whine facemasks. put politics aside let science handle one - may never truly recover.

Crook no, liar yeah. understand people would skeptical masks handled.


Rational not, think folks felt manipulated resent that. I’m surprised honestly. student athlete already making fall teams football, soccer, volleyball etc.. start summer training within school facilities. seems harmless except add fact people different teams contracted corona yet still training congregating one space once. go school secluded part country although don’t see season following fall everywhere else doesn’t even seem improving great. Wow y'all gross claiming that. Crazy times know sucks personally don’t think right time. I’ve appointments ultrasound person. live CA. Texans largely head mountain towns vacation? Serious question. Also ironic, Trump went Florida he's Arizona tomorrow. chance believe non covid related. I'm real sure Florida. Arizona he's gonna visit two hundred mile wall guess. he's hitting date hot spots well lol... Two things that: neighboring state room, second, trying get there. It’s one thing move patient hospital hour away, 5 hours away?

The US pretty big. took 9 hours go one end Germany other. drive 9 hours even State! Traffic pretty much normal SoCal, God help us. retrospect may true, time scientific community still working transmission. may cdc alerted us might transmitted via surfaces thought. still would lockdowns. competent administration perhaps could known alot virus earlier. University Pittsburgh Medical Center I’d rather cynical baby medical economical crash pretended everything would fine. Fuck... fuck... fuck... North Rhine-Westphalia totally struggling. 7 day average Cali record high read elsewhere, imagine asking whining brats refuse wear mask inconvenience ration WWII. I'm sick y'all anyway. What's bad typical job? experience unless hard labor hot weather kind pinch little bit, maybe fog glasses bit wearing them. That's puzzle, especially Germany good virus app good test-and-trace. 

The factory closed last Wednesday (17th June) 2 infections. rest staff tested appear 1,700 infections staff 6,500.

The question whether community infected, whether staff led sufficiently segregated lives affected everyone else. truly successful would prevented even outbreak foreign worker communities Alright thats true lol

What mean *Scientists* dont get political passionate work, demands apolitical prevent partisan beliefs affecting decision making. understand openings everything America right ""until notice"" rather set dates, organizations clue safe reopen. 'zero sum' mentality control. Actually like told do, listening advice going get killed probably sick, they’re someone told wearing mask made look like Chinese, rather telling truth, wearing mask makes look like responsible person cares yourself, family friends. horrible force lead people astray best health. Honestly bet something Newsom hinting reverse reopening stages DeSantis said nothing sort. Florida tosses around possibility rolling back reopening; Disney World follow. masks work?

Look countries Middle East.... :) U might surprised...no news stories directly it...have original research! starts top. president could wear mask we’d tons followers wearing mask. could tweet day would also help. cant believe country made wearing mask political. I'd prefer hear explanation. Caught virus two days returning work tested negative previous symptoms. Doctor thinking got false negative. county limited access testing can’t even get re-tested confirm, we’re 99% sure COVID. annoying symptom, besides obvious chest pain coughing, loss taste smell. Like, really necessary? enjoy soup LOL either. People die, they're replaced. awful thing say. Proof? Exactly. basic math people done using calculator app using information Google 30 seconds. apparently moderators feel otherwise.

If even question facts threw means amount math educate you.

But hey even 10% unemployment rate country 330,000,000 people, assuming counting half population (ie people would normally working) 15 million people.

Fuck even million people died (it's 10% right now) math would correct, assuming unemployment rate skyrocket 30%. Oh man, deaths rising Headline change: Man acts irresponsibly asks others pay mistake. happening. Aliens definitely lock doors run red lights get past Earth. Like Nevada? governor issued emergency order masks statewide? Time vaccine comes. Oof! husband work friend (sorry story wasn’t clearest) - best you. vigilant trying keep people close us safe informed possible. lot people seem letting guard trying best encourage extra careful.

The walks definitely help you!  Yikes, angry piece garbage are. top completely lack reading comprehension. 

You said something completely false elective surgeries non life threatening situations. poster responded say daughters cancer care postponed. Instead using brain saying ""Oh wow know could cancel things like this, sorry hear that"", go spew garbage something completely different feel right. shit, could dangerous go hospital, never said wasn't. said non elective mean non life threatening. can't believe someone like actually breathes air decent people world, legitimately boggles mind.

Edit: read post history. see what's going on. get feeling right engaging arguments random people Reddit 😅. Man must nothing going time anger. Yes, anything many hospital occupancy rates bit higher reality. think that's Wuhan, batching 10 people test iirc. sure Beijing. mean, really *need* ratio COVID patients?

They're really demanding compared normal ICU patient load. give fluids, prone them, incubate, ventilate, wait. recover don't. 3/7/20 Trump said anyone wanted test could get one. tests suddenly? American way, though. :/ 65% Americans ignored representatives. Dad also killed JFK. True story heard Trump twitterverse 2016. Probably world go awhile. Various spots taking turns pariahs. Glad non-pariah interlude  3 months ago, ""specialist"" said ""from 40k 120k dead"".


I said ""might well say know, imagine kind margin error"".


I downvoted told shut up.


Yet, are.


I would loved proven wrong... guy shared drinks bar irresponsible.

The people going protesting irresponsible.

I'ts really unfortunate people endangering others' lives.  call unity, tell everyone wear mask, say words like “we together”, tell sob stories, show sympathy, later say “What happened George travesty promise never happen again. Let clear, black lives matter” 

Bam. approval would soared roof. It’s 13 sites. 10 times many state state run probably stimulus ballin. Still dont understand tf got paid much. “Mandatory”. enforceable law enforcement.

TIL mean *Medical*.

Doctors surprised well Trump understands *Medical*. Agreed. unavoidable matter battling virus effectively made political issue, likely robber barons really government (i.e. businesses large medium) million dollar question. indicator things come. sad deaths occurred. can’t imagine grief many people experiencing. It’s terrible US read believed this, we'd see 30% population think 5%. Yes.

And shouldn’t expect anything change.

Texas decided let burn amazing mass testing COVID infection numbers! Texans flooding Midwest right vacation. they’re largely heading mountain towns fuck areas little medical resources.  county openly accessible testing sites, go pre-screening, even take week-week half get back schedule test, takes 10+ days results point. county mandated masks, we’re seeing pushback everywhere. One staff yelled trying get adult man wear mask inside building. Still talks shut downs. handling terribly governor still won’t shut state down. I’m elective surgery next week NC. Please, please, please let mask order work! Idk downvoted. chuckled! Vote GOP area, north Charlotte, I’d say maybe 30% people stores wearing masks. go Walmart market today(after announcement)and number jumped 90+%, even order isn’t fully effect. country gone crazy. totally agree protests. add pandemic, crashing economy hopeless government makes wonder much last like this. Right you. people go resume normal activities, can’t help wonder sometimes...wait, overreacting?

I mean, know I’m not, people taking risks high alert long desensitize you, fleeting thoughts still there. Oh yeah, doubt California hell. ""Highest cases ever"" shocking headline run with. wut? Contact tracers country already said protests enough mask wearers cause surge spike cases. 

Its rural people gone vacation May June came back.

Also, even protests caused surges, literally could blame Trump unlawful bullshit demands protests. invest unmarked graves/mass burials? 
THANK YOU! /s one point, hospital 5:1 ratio ICU 7 patients floors. Nurses getting sick didn’t help either. Honestly don’t great answer you. Maybe many infected? haven’t experienced kind spike despite mass protests, lockdown restrictions lifted, etc. it’s like they’re contact tracing locking like Wuhan. maybe far widespread nyc knew 

All know trust research regarding IFR estimations, given every country worldwide produced independent study come range estimations million cases month. much. early outbreaks closely followed high death rates, China Italy New York. see almost two weeks detection growth death rates still low. Elderly don’t last long. usually perish within week two contracting decease. kids would worse affected hospital stay financial meltdown. 

In latter, money, former, amount money plus bill hospital stay plus continuing cost health plus, it’s far likely another member family could also get sick, compounding problem exponentially, also could die, really limits ability create income. 

I friend age another state, health me, hospital week, says breathing complications. Maybe go away, maybe not. 

I’ve broke before; it’s bad. 

I ain’t never dead before, I’m going try avoid it. 

I type critical mean troll, it’s different perspective “surviving crisis” means.

Edit: meant kids’ mom went hospital. Seemed unclear. Sounds like threat. I’m concerned. say there’s lot don’t know, true, here’s know:

There thousands recovered young people indication mild asymptomatic infections leave long term damage. 

There still reports people becoming symptomatic twice (yes, people reported test positive twice, people getting Covid infections bad go ARDS getting again). I’ve practicing dentistry 30 years, 8 hours day mask.... much CO2! 😷 No, assholitus considered disability. Oh okay, must completely unable support base level employees? assertion, worst mentioning.

The 10b borrowed (which represents 1/5 debt there's lot unpack there), company remains completely capable floating, reasonable extent, hourly park employees. don’t think many Americans really care....just look around public social distancing &amp; masks. People politicize want, really PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY.  act responsibly act irresponsibly gain kinds sympathy looking like victim? Welcome America. :) Spain's large scale testing came around 1.1% understand anger. get 1,700+ cases discovered? Can’t fix stupid I'm shocked! could possibly seen coming! JFC. Threaten tip you? smdh... definitely aren’t reliable sites data. also clearly support BLM protests would post anything make protests look bad. saying can’t true, saying may need better sources support views ""The call coming inside Whitehouse..."" fast! local band way throwing halfway Halloween party next month. Granted, PA haven’t seeing latest surge cases, still... Yee \*Cough\* Haw  Hmmmmmmmm......mmmmmmmmm.... Everything I've read suggests might tied elective surgeries main source profit hospitals. Take grain salt would make sense. 8 months plenty time know long term impacts outlive acute phase infection company 15% took option. people came back last week. I’ve working since mid May. one lost jobs know of. Terrible employers gonna terrible. Pathetic extremely cowardly. Dallas one convention center believe got torn mid April used. They'll share probably. Sucks you, USA. agree 100% this. Nah Disney delayed reopening indefinitely. haven’t given new date confirmed reopen 17th. 

Florida’s still screwed though, Uncle lives there, says restaurants urban centers stuffed full people without masks even resurgence. California avoid - act today. politicians. Frankly, one inescapable conclusion I've come people would prefer us high risk would hurry die, everything go back normal. almost like he's entire business career something.  whole point electing people vote every minutia policy make quicker (relatively) decisions necessary South Africa. That’s bad thought like 21%. said I'm disturbed alarmed folks. Obviously anyone calling hoax refusing social distance wear mask far bigger problem threat everyone. 

That mean OK demean people seeing families safest way possible leaving homes. I’m sure anyone surprised this. cannot work, cannot get paid. Pretty simple. It’s unfortunate vast majority people cannot work home. Maybe 50 years many active PSA campaigns? 

See also: seat belts, drinking driving think that's true, know lead need maximize dollars. system simply know maximize anything else health education community. People going forego buying groceries due feelings masks. 

Messaging public officials leaders impacts behaviors. suspect true masks well. like anyone real strong opinions March. I’m sure BLM demonstrations tens thousands shoulder shoulder Houston early June anything 🤨 agree. make small mostly insignificant compromises freedom order make driving safer, death toll driving minor restrictions freedoms, remains quite high. high steals living days Americans Covid, even ran free, herd immunity levels. driving, draw line significant freedoms willing give prevent deaths far sooner draw line covid, even though, took similar scale restrictions freedoms like mandating mask wearing certain situations, charging people like woman led protests, went home Covid-19 positive roommates knew Covid-19, went back protesting continued feeling symptoms, would fewer living days stolen Americans driving.

Why think? think ok covid-19 driving? also need clear consistent communication ""social distancing"" means. turn completely predictable events... pointing said wrong disgusting bootlicking apologist?  virus deadly enough.  beds. experienced health care workers needed make use beds. Calling temp agencies calling ophthalmologists remotely reassuring me. Damn hope really frowned upon around here. Y’all dark mother fuckers state government hamstringing local officials.

They thing NC. Red rural areas sticking blue urban areas. guess nature's way cleaning environment. Save ones using brains need general strike. Fuck Tesla fuck musk nightingale hospitals UK. Basically massive hoc ICU wards built arenas. needed use them, government basically cancelled lockdown imagine soon. streets Bellevue hospital/MEO NYU Hospital rows morgue trucks. Hell yeah Philly represent think he's fallen trap lot folks - *can't* things work predicted (long time vaccine even real treatment, slow return) hurts financially. he/they connect financial concern they're saying? Maybe. do, would admit it? Probably not. much less sympathetic version concern regular worker safety - go work can't eat, pay bills, live - entirely different.

I say little sympathy, people tend believe stated whatever affects bottom line. cases personal, like much. masklessly hanging groups

I feel like specifically what's causing lot spread. see close friend relative think what's harm wearing mask, look healthy sick. I'll admit something I've struggled times. go bars beaches etc refuse wear masks denied spot ICU. Wtf d\*\* Test drive Tesla would change mind. People never one never understand. too, man Texas governor right now: ""I force stay home, LOVE GOD PLEASE STAY HOME!!!"" Thanks! getting information from? USA tests per mil-92,000, UK - 128,000 Spain - 110,000. top 5 countries alone based confirmed cases USA ranks third tests per million.  Why? says so? Lol Test drive Tesla would change mind. People never one never understand. expect see articles running beds? 2 weeks? 3 weeks? Small margin error, yes. Precaution mildly inconvenient, ya know? disagreeing you, but, 28% people ICU treated coronavirus. got ass beat 21  mention aluminum shortage. cannot find aerosol disinfectant anywhere drink choices limited. live that. Stay safe tho. Canada’s fine press conference large spike week week 20-29 year olds. sudden.

What describing would likely gradual increase. Hi, already posted Thank you! ready sacrifice himself?  Yup.

I friend planning go along bridal shower, bachelorette party next weekend. 

Neither good idea, especially since bachelorette involves travel. 150 million (globally) expected starve death. Hi, already posted Thank you! Last checked don’t 2 million deaths. 100k half caused deaths coronavirus half governors putting covid patients retirement homes. killed lot old people. 

This virus politicized, hyping cases thing keep lock going people aren’t dying.

Be adult read studies memes. Well, sorry I’m pointing article talks she’s great friends Elon’s current wife kind made seem somehow kind behavior, really, it’s clear passage end doesn’t like her, respect least bit, making motives friendly highly questionable. 

She comes crazy Elon me, trying really hard sound jaded bitter. Let's start people demanding reopening Inside vs outside, life death vs haircut, yeah, that.... Agreed.   Narrator *But wasn't* spelled Costello wrong feel quite sorry blatant incontextual communication skills. that’s learned American news outlets well. Terror Management Theory Whitmer ballsiest leader country. Literally people storm place work weapons still refused give inch reopening state. Now, Michigan one places control virus. one 26 states, ""increase"" significant enough stop progress. Nahhhh said done tremendous job. fake news again. Next!!!! 
Twenty-eight percent ICU patients treated COVID-19, per article. Trump said states low cases early May took care early better. Therefore issue

/s Masks need 100% useful required.

Seatbelts 100%. Motorcycle helmets 100%. Condoms anywhere near 100%.

Still useful, though.  Yeah. know. think real key give people false sense security saying ""face coverings"" prevent spread. 

To obvious happening. *Possibly* individual behaviors like getting within 6 feet others about, making unnecessary trips whatever. *certainly* protests going around country - people large dismiss criticism violate local restrictions regarding group size caveat everyone wearing masks. new hotspots northeast get control. Though seeing signs today states accepting reality. wonder still dont believe using face mask fucking kidding. reddit see people performing sorts mental gymnastics support actions/beliefs matter end political spectrum are. Facts damned. could fix healthcare system don’t shortages. girlfriend's hospital Brooklyn overwhelmed obese younger people would recovered home healthy weight, drove death rate among elderly. black neighborhood, typically higher obesity rates. Houston fattest city America, undeniably noticeably fatter NYC prevalence severity obesity(yea there's 300 pound people NYC, Texans pushing 4-500 like Olympic sport). cities 25% black, susceptible demographic obesity Covid. I'm trying optimistic, looking like another tragedy making.   civilized part America (i.e. Northeast) canceling everything, we're generally responsible enough many large parties. Ireland pretty good no? Blah blah blah I'm nurse. Blah blah blah happen me. finish Today's published AZ numbers largely tests performed yesterday, reduced number due already testing capacity Presidential motorcades. Deaths way today. presume we'll go back 3000+ cases tomorrow. 

Looks like didn’t ask enough fuckin people don’t give fuck get sick take dozen drain them. If?  100% agree, nobody wearing masks getting close other. like ton compliance. Leadership stepped up, people too. gotta remember there's self selecting thing going on. leave house now, going see about? mostly going people care beging with. us still staying home venturing stores to. Thanks insight enough people died Texas, sudden count? sounds like bias anything else good sir. know full report wasn’t released earlier. 


“The drug — cheap, widely available steroid called dexamethasone — seem help patients dire straits, data suggest. also may risky patients milder illness, timing treatment critical.

The drug “may harm patients, we’re entirely sure patients are,” said Dr. Samuel Brown, assistant professor pulmonary critical care medicine University Utah School Medicine Salt Lake City, involved research.”

This need extremely cautious initial studies, especially vaccines. 

Oh need extra cautious perform studies. 

“Patients given steroid receiving respiratory support, however, actually died slightly higher rate similar patients given drug, although difference statistically significant.” Hmmmm... I'm doctor, given pretty sick go ventilator, people pretty sick likely die people kinda sick, seem like coincidence two numbers would related. lot deadlier people can’t get health care everyone gets sick around time. Tens thousands infections fills emergency rooms up. Millions simultaneous infections horrific. environment yes. Biden likely lock. b/c Trump botched response pandemic PLUS financial hardships etc. November long ways - long, unless pulls rabbit hat likely loses fall. ""35% Americans total fucking idiots""

Really I'm surprised number low.  Jpow likely get back. Pew pew pew pewnting money. sentiment got us mess important you. needs outweighs neighbors. selfish entitled it’s showing. country whole. like 25% crazies. maybe engage actual debate then, making ""side"" (not sides shit) look awful Except got right accurate said ""120k dead"". theres many possible variables change outcome. People wear masks? 40k, people dont wear masks reopen quickly? 120. bar opened back first day back tomorrow. 

I feel like I'm getting sent slaughter. Yes, been. like trumpette cultist worthless trash COULD one there. statistically impossible screeching morons desperately need tiny little possibility harm others stupidity. Yeah doesn’t seem like made much progress front. think definitely learned virus treat enough save people infection rate NYC also reported. Quite friends March, told come tests crazy here. Imagine using word ""literally"" retardedly. I’m saying would enforce office crowded boss doesn’t care? Illinois done pretty well, too. course that’s great numbers aren’t like beginning numbers going fast enough especially times reopening?? curious way make Texan hate Texas make spend entire summer Texas. think important question. get 1,700 infected without people realizing? thought Germay testing good catching half cases. 

If close 2 confirmed infections, get 1,700? One infected comes in, gives 100 people one day, couple days later 100 infected give 1,700? happened really quickly otherwise would noticed or?

Either something like testing/tracing effective actually waaay cases reported. think people always giveaway really are, crisis, boy shine.

I already fence guy, trying damnedest keep friendship, revealed truly realized destroying self worth holding on.

And definitely seems trend throughout pandemic, people cutting ties ghosting character/value reveals. spikes? anyone know N95 masks prevent countries data taken frkm? governor's 3 states lie announce building thousands holding cells underneath airports quarantine anyone 14 days cells fly AZ, TX, CA FL. would good deterrent. That’s like saying looking light fixture “proves” certain characteristics floor you’re standing on. 

Ridiculous. recently baby went every appointment plenty birth board tele appointments. 35% probably consists flat earthers anti vaxxers. ! remind me! Cuomo saying today may stop allowing people visit states.

It's going take much city like Manhattan flair again. stopping people coming stopping people leaving returning. locked mine months made damn sure don’t want another. ignorant fools flaunted wearing mask first 120,000 deaths, difference think another 60,000 make? intel January, try downplay administration worst case criminal negligence modern history credit. 

What sharpen dagger, write death poem chose second sturdy hands. 

Instead, goes dumbest coverup is. 

Some leaders brought unmitigated disaster people incompetence negligence refuse take responsibility that, worst, people actually let get away it. 

How isn’t #seppuku_now trend now? enough people died use statistics instead relying actual counting testing. find academic studies looking IFR New York City, Spain, Belgium, Sweden (weekly), many looking Bergamo. Get rational thinking let panic, dammit! that's want, yourself. I'm borderline retarded it. write Sci Fi fun. thinking outloud. Seriously. really mean small handful North East states, particularly New York, curbed regional outbreak May. Take out, rest country barely even plateaued. large country consistent national response, really look different regions separately, outlook different state state. south/southwest/west shut shit really hit fan, they're going nothing show it. suspect going lot worse, too--there something like 200 million people regions cases rising. sad, better preparation coordination federal level really could prevented lot this. How's toilet paper stash? Welp, goes Roanoke again... TIL Florida, Toronto. clear. Lmao get fr downvoted. People think mass protests pandemic good idea. Common sense lost Texas: ""We demand slow down!""

Virus: ""yea, whatever"" HA! It'll horrible. Yall compulsory masks like MD. especially enjoyed small details. think people need see reality living disease, instead simple ""yeah positive."" hearing nurse makes much hyper-aware severity situation. Fauchi shmexy me? Bull. Shit.

When go hospital surgery next week, tested covid. know providers employees screened temps taken twice daily, employee symptoms sent home negative test. know everybody wearing mask, 90% wearing correctly. Compare last trip grocery store tell hospital dangerous. ""There *was* one. more. similar note, see Dow back 25k? thank that.""

/s Small, simple weddings best. beach 10 people there. stress. Eloping even one better! baby 7 weeks ago freaking terrified started, think around 28 weeks. help husband works ICU. would trying get pregnant right now. Yet, see pregnant women fb taking vacations, one Florida. funny looking history I’m always like “How could doctors realize washing hands good patient!” I’m like “oh...that’s how.” Sad see number 10 main comments thread. waiting see someone called lack statistical details polling. Likely statistically significant. Called Chicken Little doomsdayer flu kept saying definitely already before, blah blah blah. Proceeds bash real science, allowing people show without getting test prior. real two-faced response. interested Dr. Osterholm show literally next day back pseudoscience theories. friends especially Eddie Bravo whatever name believes 5G Bill Gates chip conspiracy theory. show really turned shit. used actually ask real questions without interesting guests, nothing MMA bros talking badass are.

It's ironic even back then, pretty much everything Dr. Osterholm said came true, even given limited knowledge back then. that's ironic south seem want wear masks. well way 180k. USA #1 wooo stocks go shit? thanks remember reading AI designated treatment regiments better human counterparts too... wore mask day doctor's office. actually made easier breathe since stuff air Lincoln County rural think. extreme left portland is. think stupid error. ironic Yep. Scareymommy get news s:/ confirmed cases, antibody numbers. Well, ""in public"" really mean? Chicago metro high mask compliance stores open (though boomers like nose out.) 

Bars restaurants places people can't wear masks. I'm wondering else ""in public"" means.

And unfortunately houses worship notoriously bad mask compliance responsible tons outbreaks. know that's about.

Yeah. We're gonna problems. happen time? get worse worse nobody wants stay home wear mask? host rarely let live long term, generally improving chances reproduce spread. get host quarantined killed, spread well mutation doesn't.

Concern lot spread occurs presymptomatic, there's much selection process happens host spread. here's hoping. I’m AZ confirm idiots think inconvenienced thing oppressed. 

I know 11 people tested positive last week. governor anything except make mayors scapegoats tell us figure live it. Illinois - seeing surges cases different states, likely happening Illinois, too. local church first socially distanced mass since lockdown. haven’t cleared first wave hundreds new cases appearing day, would wise hold recreational travel foreseeable future. isn’t worth risk long-term lung damage. many opportunities exposure Atlanta Illinois, family partner... reliable treatment vaccine.

It stinks is.
Hang there!! I’m interested see well mRNA vaccine comparison think current numbers reflect excess deaths. also trend seen countries. That's great. That's good idea, too. grandparents here, might work. Except, grandpa works *at local hospital*, we'd definitely need go work 2 weeks, haha!  Bruh low-key miss lockdown. month straight work amazing.  precisely point along. Even recover covid, many brand new preexisting conditions organ damage virus, making susceptible new shit future...... spike? We're highest new cases per day since beginning April. We're there, maaaan! Deaths follow cases 2-4 week delay. virus also directly attacks damages heart tissue. Kidneys too. Testicular lesions also observed. Blood clots. list goes on... Mine might filter breath since MERV 13 MERV 15 filter (have kinds available use; tend use 15) Trump meant said we’d much winning we’d get tired it? sound like mom! can't tell shes actually changed mind, stays quiet knows I'll call reasons stupid. company reduced slow one second. I'm engineer, I've worked home day two week, production floor everyday. makes think better idea what's going NYC? anyone know replaced ones damaged Ya, isn’t end. We’re gonna need lot relief. 

If (when) go back lockdown, LOT people going lose jobs. included. Granted, I’m situation extend extra $600 benefits, I’d ok unemployment get through. that’s things extended added to. they’re not, I’m gonna fun time. Like mitt romney marched BLM? literally hard believe worst enemy, yet see evidence contrary. sad must folks “Greatest Generation” bucket see perpetual decline Greatness submissive cuckold’em. order mask orders came effect:

The virus really dosnt let anyone get away bullshit Thank resigning easily bunch shills forum pushing Trump rally possible source protest?

&amp;#x200B;

you guys could try harder... guess useful idiots believe need, transform dead body useless mask.  If???? spiking TX governor doesn’t care. Chyna Flu. /s Definitely. Cuomo sucks.  kid. millions infected, would expect someone make simple follow-up study couple thousand patients right? would helpful data disease? .... guess, report death numbers forget rest.

No definitive evidence nobody gives damn study, good indicators suggest 10-40% cases age 25 long-lasting issues. guess clear. Living im place median cost lf housing 3x national average luxury making solid wages. choosing pay obscene prices housing. Thats luxury. know people like hear that, thats housing expensive. Yeh governor absolute piece shit fault, hes making good show seeming care right now.. reakky really really bad, like, major cities bad.... surprise one ever there, really hope Flagstaff handling better. If? spiking continuously? think approach right. 

Point is, herd immunity achieved far less vaccines smart prioritizing targeting succeptible populations. I'm excited fall!! Sorry I'm used everyone like ""yeah well ok protestors then?"" even talking that. happening lot feel like want change subject G.Floy*d protests. nationwide case trend got really skewed badly well NY did. take look moving 7-day average cases, went downward trend upward trend around June 10th. 

Deaths generally lag 2-3 weeks would expect see average deaths per day start trend soon. double-lung transplant recipient told wear N95 mask whenever go public transport, hospitals drug stores. places everyone wears makeshift mask, non-N95 masks enough stop cross infections. Top experts lung infections lung transplant clinics. Authorities really listen guidelines Covid-19. woman fired fixing numbers broke day department surperssing deaths cases next week move next phase.

Disney open kill innocent people. insane conspiracy theory February spike sulfur dioxide Wuhan due burning millions corpses. However, SO2 map forecast model actual measurements. 

The map, GOES-5, takes known sources SO2, power stations, smelters, industry, combines weather conditions predict likely SO2 levels. 

I suspected noticed volcano erupted Philippines SO2 spike showed map, obviously measuring SO2 forecast model. However, nickel smelter Norilsk shows time. onus people suggesting wear masks? How??

If side right, people wore masks didn’t need to. side wrong, anti-mask people kill hundreds thousands people unnecessarily. think onus people taking precautions prove right first people put masks? Surely see logic holds zero scrutiny. 

Also, several studies demonstrated mask wearing reduces transmission rates. laziness excuse find several available. 

But since lazy use google, lets quick test. isn’t super “scientific”, it’s enough demonstrate mask wearing benefits obvious enough common sense. Ready?

Hold hand inches front mouth, blow out. Feel that? Cool. put mask, hold hand distance mouth blow again. See happened? I’ll ruin surprise you, breath travel fast far mask on. Okay, we’ve got million people walking around infected, least half probably don’t even know it. virus spread primarily people’s breath. think reason would beneficial infected person’s breath travel less far? can’t figure out, congratulations, you’re idiot. limo-dicked sounds pretty impressive, Two thoughts: 

1) 0% surprised. I've skeptical polls keep saying Americans want lockdowns intend staying home, that's sure they're acting area--and live large city state whose government taken seriously.

2) can't data I'd curious know \*types\* things people same. Like, looked cellphone moving around, see I'm almost much pre-shutdown, I'm low risk activities compared before. Before, might hung friend indoors sitting next couch, walk six feet apart masks park. phone shows still moving... risk level MUCH lower. There's plenty people stupid right now, there's doubt that, I'm sure I'm person behaving like either. we'd stop testing cases. Duh. Well told ""people"" ""slow testing down."" Trump's logic traditionally flawed much linking less testing less cases. man must really think people cease exist cannot see them. Ah, gotcha, thought Florida. It’s obvious cases day testing ramping up, virus getting worse. Downvote want, death rate proves it. Norcal too. go Target last weekend every single person one mask on. honestly impressed.  Agreed, darn protesters gathering groups tens thousands somehow people think traps much CO2 die traps virus makes spread easily. people focus misuse mask means effective without stopping understand level effectiveness better none. Bonkers. represents global causes deaths, US countries. wondering thing first TTC? Disneyland California. I'm sure Kushner's job save lives, re-direct money Trump assets news country touted chloroquine 2.0. news India thing. say paper lied, media certainly misconstrue misrepresent it. see word MEDIA clearly post right. acting media done thing every new treatment far? That's get views make money all. get tested, get call youre positive.....and really scary part begins sitting waiting.....waiting symptoms.....waiting bad symptoms send er happen not....

the hours minutes tick away....turn days regress...

and really wanted go store reopened.....to buy shoes.

I dont get it, whatever....gotta live life walk fucking fear guess..... contary, early lockdowns actually good, virus would eradicated.

The problem actually horrible, unenforced half ass lockdown, somehow perceived good one.

Just another consequence refusing admit countries better learnd Idk you’re US there’s large portion America trusts Fox News news source watch trust would think nothing worry about. mom fallen worm hole acts like I’m crazy ordering groceries online cutting hair.

First Trump president this, fucking stupid look rest world. *Insert SpongeBob 'imma head out' meme here* Everything burns. People like, takes away self-expression? Oh yeah, fucking pick fabric make masks express yourself! Probably full pay. 

Your tax dollars work. 180k total 180k addition already died? If? already have. ""CHL"" ""Stand Ground"" would stop quickly. thought read opening delayed? dealing climate change si ml play nature dealing us. whataboutism, agreeing.

- Red Skull number 2.5X higher current 7-day average 620. 

**source: Worldometers - Click 7 day moving average far situation one think US like 50 allied nations. Cultures attitudes specific one loosely. current states struggling covid went lockdown big spread happened, places seemingly far away. felt pointless see entire “nation” locked like new 100 cases day max.

Foolish? Naive? much so. within realms human behavior nation government can’t dictate citizens day day behaviors design.

Really big failure nationally Trump admin utter failure grasp deliver organized strategy state governments follow.

It left state much independent whims local attitudes US faced since 1800s.

The states didn’t act wisely learning others face music now. long states like New York already seen first hand opening surge don’t respike hard remain hopeful, despite deaths long term damage health many certainly ahead. Oh stage admit countries arent lying, they're better? Texas, Florida, Arizona never ""cooped up""

California state serious lockdown rising big cases. Headliner: Violently Coughing Phlems don’t understand Texas starting ween people unemployment requiring job searches now. essential services pretty much hiring....but moron governor telling people stay home. Wtf asshole Yeah, basically worst-nightmare level virus. hot spots? hospitals run? dont understand.. matter time? need lockdown need mandatory masks Gov said state shut last resort 🙃 *music* Hes wrong. know probably 30 ppl laid off. read ONE name might met passed covid making combined 150k year 75k alone savings want imply protests caused super spreaders spike. Reddit attacks imply that, reddit made clear protests cause super spreaders increase cases pro-work protests absolutely cause increases cases small businesses handful employees absolutely cause spikes. remember read somewhere last test, workers went back home potentially brought virus back. Tracing cross borders quite hard. This. narcissist *never* admits shortcoming mistake. moron even need admit mistake - could easily gotten way adults handle problem probably seen soaring popularity. gonna chance taking vaccine, I'll wait properly tested batch thanks. bad sounds, actually considerably predicting weeks ago. saying 200k dead mid September. 

Don't get wrong, still mind blowing. good see less 200k. sounds really fucked say.  live liberal Southern California , plenty idiots wearing masks too

This whole country disgusts education important. believe Arizona 50th whole United States. hate living here. I’m surrounded people like much I’ve left house maybe 5 times since March groceries, order pickup advance grocery packed mask-less people. live town 53,000 people, hospital maybe, MAYBE, 200 beds total, we’re already taking overflow areas close by. 

I saw acquaintance’s post complaining big 5 tried make wear mask went scamdemic dems trying wreck trump , trying save us illuminate. olympic swimmer early 30s got hit hard it, saw article ago. Boeing 777-300ER. Hellenophilia makes good point though linking length flight. Please stop

They bad but....one worse other?

Yeah, no. bad. Yikes, good look opinion Much lower rates international travel. Glad agree. bend spank you. King trump obeys nothing king trump doesn’t want Yes plz send help :( punishable law. 

Attempted murder.

Fuck people. ""Return to""? never real lockdown.

People spread viruses outbreak-style work.
The real spread malls, grocery shopping, retail, conferences, protests, etc interact lots people *don't* normally day-to-day basis.

Too many people took check continued engage risky behaviour.

American ""lockdowns"" useless failure.
Returning absurd.

If want fight virus seriously, maybe real lockdown would help.
But give funding people unless they're *really* staying home.
And ultimately, need move mask-based solution (good masks, garbage). Mans going 120 whole way lmao Dropping? Bro we're time highs lol Dental offices. Dentists heck tine due aerosols obviously dental patients can’t masked. Q? see point, don’t disagree; insignificant opinions, see current protests global unity, bottom-tier society cause noise possible. 

I agree extent, influence corps funding obvious, ever time people feel like voice actually matters would now. lot government officials hot seat every move dictates legacy, keep peace media backyards one could assume ever feelings matter effect politics, now. Yeah ur rite I'm retarded live surrounded people either
A) believe virus real ok attend rallies
Or
B) positive best intentions mean virus ignores protests attend

So apologies find poll result tad optimistic. 

I American say every country shut borders us. virus politicized election year majority ""teams"" making worst assumptions decisions far. Science flushed along logic common sense.  Nearly 18,000 Americans die CNN induced panic October 1 unless everyone turns notifications stream.  be... in... haven’t first several days rally.. ... discuss 6 months whether masks work not, RESPIRATORY virus. 3 half ish months...the Spanish flu took like year half things got kind normal. imagine, least take long. Americans short attention span though...you would thought COVID totally gone protests news barely mentioned it. I'm wondering make sure stockpile fall comes around. LOL mandatory? Mean every country back normal lol GG disgusted humanity, become strongest species ? How?

For long time, idiots would culled herd. 

Modern society tries save even idiots themselves. 

People given information, like mandatory classes per month even per week tell stuff like ""wear helmet"" safety rules. Then, ignore die, fuck'em. 

THIS DONE ADULTS !!!!

Children developed enough, rules must mandatory them. 22 25 years old, brain supposed fully developed, want wear helmet. 

Rules also mandatory risk hurting others. Like wearing seatbelt turn projectile body kill others. stays mandatory.  moronic governor anxious kiss liar's ass open early. voted him! exactly, millions Seems like lot new accounts going posts attacking masks lately. sort context I'm missing this? seems pretty reasonable, say big deal anything, everyone look numbers represented live. absolutely good idea - places may reporting, ""over"" reporting like this, either way valuable information know.

Hopefully find happiness life stop holding much hatred towards people trying always right. not, hide rock somewhere world much better it. like anyone would notice care. Fuck hope something works favor man  really need second wave? possible virus sit around peak fit go down? plateau speak? understand you’re coming from. Personally I’ve chosen strict isolation fear (I don’t want blood hands). understand you’re proposing isn’t realistic it’d impossible prove exactly infected someone virus 2-14 day incubation period... even left house groceries every couple weeks you’ll still interact least hundred people store... good luck identifying infected let alone getting charged/convicted. 

I agree it’s shitty COVID major threat, I’m trying say things people rightfully afraid don’t want see punished taking one fear seriously another. hospitals could know didnt wear masks need choose treat. Honestly East Asians thinking right  I’ve lost child-like wonder joys surprise.  Good luck getting sizable number Americans’ heads asses  that’s truth, I’d prefer least state(CA) charge covid response testing. God help people Florida, Texas, etc (which still don’t approve action) Oh god... I'm moving SC end July NYS (moving job). I'm terrified. going force back classroom maskless kids? school full STEM phds let happen right? RIGHT??? :( Wearing mask political. It’s basic public health hygiene. wearing mask political. point need conservative voices start saying *it needs law*. I'm conservative part Arizona keep hearing local politicians falling line governor, keeps backing like beeping semi issue keep sticking scary refrain ""GOVERNMENT OVERREACH"" mandate masks.

Laws exist stop negatively impacting others. dumbass affected, idiot God-given right American. Cloth masks far perfect help *lot*, stop spraying droplets mouth nose sneezing, coughing, shouting guy letting dog poop lawn singing immortal Queen song *Somebody Love* top lungs 3 honk neighbors.

*Wearing masks mostly protects people you. spreading virus know it.* two fundamental points critical know many ""freedom"" people know vs many care.

It's forcing people protect themselves. ensuring people *don't* want get virus right protected idiots anything different lives.

Think - government pass laws dictate people wear, grandpa could go jogging butt-naked Main Street whenever wanted. laws - guessed - would negative effect people want see it. what's important, protecting sensibilities innocent eyes protecting people *dying suffering permanent damage bodies entire lives* result coronavirus infection? know oil country be. Everyone use making way much money undereducated. Stay safe good luck us 45-55 y.o. say?  Well seeing America hold beer moment pandemic sure. mean cutting test funding cases continue rise see extending thoughts.  It’s kinda soul-crushing, isn’t it. Wow. Screw 46-54 year olds think. man.

Really? law says “all wear mask?” 

Is hard see?

How hell protect everyone Covid lurking about? Short staying home forever, mask wearing social distancing have. even works it’s ubiquitous. carve-out creates yet another truck sized hole Covid. honestly, really doesn’t fix racism targeting. Straw dog arguments (although may fact data point long list), It’s race one side racism. mask-wearing stereotype conjure signify “black”. go. stfu US hasn’t 1500 deaths single day since May 27th. Stop bullshit fear mongering. 99.74% survival rate. Even lower 60. dem governors aren’t putting covid patients nursing homes anymore don’t expect death rate go want justify gloom doom. US cities occupancy limits, enforced local fire marshal. start dying, want die

ftfy cases already spiked. Highest new cases single day multiple states various days past week. 

We really ""flattened curve,"" we? 

For fucks sake. 1. Nowhere comment say it’s deadly. 
2. never explicitly stated magnitude looking exactly. vague comment saying comparable bs. Look word comparable first research bc clearly understand comment. 

Edit: dumbass It'll disappear one day, like miracle? First off, agree analysis sympathise enormously predicament, I’m sorry hear about.

I keep hearing UK making predictions dramatically fewer international students, it’s obvious expecting many cancellations. I’m British, need visa stay here; daughter dual UK/Thai nationality. I’m assuming, like child, need stay UK we’ll make video calls, frankly speaking; least UK family around her, probably luckier students. generation massive tragedy, parent can’t inflict sort denial future her. trust health strong enough withstand virus. eating healthy diet, making sure enough Vitamin magnesium, exercising, getting ‘flu shot, etc. preparation. part, worried, scared even, determined; realises like wartime preparing strength psychologically. part, although I’m taking precautions, I’m vulnerable category health-wise therefore likely disqualify traveling reason, quite apart difficulty returning Thailand, I’ve lived 25 yrs.

As fellow parent, would say that, left UK 22 spent lifetime traveling living countries, often own. What’s happening family far ideal, experience make child mature, independent, braver stronger, qualities always superb assets her. vaccine sooner later things return normal.

If readers suggestions, I’m always grateful hear them. heart goes folks claimed virus might've survived they'd careful little while. frightens possibility mom catching dying effective treatment vaccine discovered.  Houston hospitals get overrun. Survey 2k people. Makes good percentage population huh.. worldometers, sort table Tests/1M pop search UBI meant people could that, know would lot families would one parents/caregivers stay home. daycare costs insane, I'm sure would happen (depending amount UBI). There's lots people would stay home could, can't. June 25, 00:00 (UTC+9)

+28 confirmed : total 12563

5 imported

23 local transmission

They would likely survived, plasma therapy. Couldn’t agree more. got laid today absolutely nowhere, got idea I’m gonna do. Thankfully I’ve given decent bit assistance thus far I’ll manage, sucks cusp financial insecurity. [archive link anyone trouble accessing article ](http://archive.is/jVt2v) means population IFR would 0.28% lower bound.

No, would case NYC representative entire population. Hope signed waivers everyone else did.  numbers match viewers watching Walking Dead? also found 1 5 make DOUBLE CARES Act unemployment currently.

That income equivalent least full time $20/hr job. double income still working full time $10/hr. 1 5 people seems low, honest. Maybe Chicago, go rural areas gonna like 50%. peak bc know properly treat stuck patients nursing homes

Nothing sources suggests this. big tits? include brain damage sick numbers? 120k death already, that's like 911 fifty times 3 months people give shit. What's wrong country? starters, prevent guy going continuing spread disease. another, knowing case counts crucial making policy. 

If shut testing one governors orders stay home, people like front lines saying extreme. president said words February locked country would maybe 20K deaths point. Total government disaster, opposite China first 5 months outbreak. Soooooo coward going order mandatory mask wearing statewide? large outbreak GE warehouse weeks ago led community spread. I'm planning all-online courses semester trust handled properly. school dragged feet closing March really started take off, even sent email saying cases confirmed county *after* case confirmed county. took forever decide finish semester online. also decided refunds given housing shut kick students middle fall semester. really see school different light seeing they're handling this, point trust keep safe, makes sad enjoyed going school there. 8 classes left, two final semesters over, worry it, I'm concerned many people get seriously ill decisions. Worse, 4th July gonna Memorial Day roids, millions infected Americans going AC parties. 

The spike 4th July going hit like truck, 50k daily cases CA TX test more. Nobody gas stations wearing masks see much foot traffic it’s insane better places, worse others. problem places bad much anything stop it. probably get back 2500-3000 deaths day going see rise sure. states cases increasing significantly (Florida, Texas, Arizona) hot right now. People likely indoor couple months ago get away heat AC.

There's good reason believe numbers explicitly manufactured manipulated, moreso major government. point leaders compensate lack individual responsibility. Stop testing? Thank you, leg exercises. ♥️ yeah, kinda helps stoking racism actually paper linked article...I'm sure though seconds research outweigh That’s one way slow testing. bearbullhorns: Waaaaa, shut fuck up, waaaaaa, waaaaaa 65% isn’t enough actually make happen. biggest concern states experiencing spikes lockdown again. Clearly half assed effort begin reopened things control. virus travels across state borders matter national security. Trump admitted wartime president. says vote? voted fully support governor. Depending age group even Triangle crap shoot. I'm Chapel Hill families right, younger college crowd large part wearing masks all. hang large social groups carrying like nothing different. Raleigh different, WRAL covering story bars clubs Glennwood open like normal evening everybody hanging without masks. 


And yea rural areas completely ignoring mandates. wife eastern NC FB feed family friends back east full ""Masks snowflakes"" ""I'm listening King Cooper"" ""Patriots wear Masks"". infuriating. Thank much changed mind. Borders states closed, not? Canada effectively closed borders provinces (notably Ontario Quebec). misinformation crisis.  average person protected herd immunity stupid gullible past - anyone would try pass bullshit real would get laughed at. complete network reinforcing junk formed chain reaction stupid across internet. Nice know care arguing peoples mental health. People aren’t wearing masks arrested confined home. Idc “freedom” “rights” comes safety. First zero experimental science there. Next zero evidence paper masks protect people public places, street beach store people generally pass other. Masks may help intimate setting doctor’s office people sitting close, talking face-to-face even clear. certainly demonstrated paper brief, maskless contact someone increased odds infected. suggesting masks worn public places yet cited experimental evidence masks helpful setting. always remember #65, feel liberated “Return lockdown” would assume lockdown. Lol grandparents thought Tylenol magical cure everything. lived well 90s... maybe? I'm big 2a guy, gotta tell twice haha USA! USA! Utter bullshit. Stimulus less months wages people extra unemployment ends June. sources basically say many variables course children get virus. caring parent isn’t going risk child exception rule won’t symptoms one greatly affected it. link mentions since children cocooned earlier isn’t much data support don’t many issues older people. Okay? what? Cult45 think *Resident speaks truthfully. Classic whataboutism, talking Herpes *and* Covid? Sign up! 4.5 % worlds population, consuming 25% worlds resources

Carter warned you. told fuck off.  I've seen, data support. poor largely used stimulus money pay debt bills. Almost like poor country little social support means already living bare necessities anyway.

Also, article posted long ago showed actually changes wealthier people's spending tanked economy lower income families' spending largely remained unchanged? uncertainty pandemic gone, every socioeconomic group going spend to, regardless whether economy declared open not. suck help people survive Except...
We 6,100 Texas  happens value stocks drops? Poof, money gone. American Patriots: “Yes, I’ll die, take others me.” subtract 5 Million recovered people? like measuring fever everyday counting degrees.

That's...a completely different set data. *NOT* what's happening. Everyone records total|active|closed cases.

The dumb people world can't subtract 5 10 see active cases, one min looking find active case numbers, would take glance day day numbers conclude danger over.

people fucking stupid. One name. James Comey. got last swing decided Clinton's defeat. I'm admin / staff even infuriating could least couple days home week zero impact productivity.  First, 125k isn’t “mega-bank”

Second, $1000/month isn’t shit. Lol, no. close people still get sick inside out. unpossible- daily tweets clearly state US leading world testing done rest world combined. probably 5% people can’t actually themselves.  That’s actually exactly happened. walked Walmart Target big items, video game consoles, TVs, luxury shit flying shelf. manufacturers couldn’t keep buying power general public had. home depot color match scrap paint, I'm pretty sure get Chinese kid make mask Trump orange matches fake tan... ones making bad decision direct line White House. I'd say start caring now? Oh...because could get sick. see. Jeg gaetter på, du ikke er den sjove dreng til fester. im going go see doctor Monday...and reason spent lockdown time drinking fear fuck virus now? Withdrawals high blood pressure weight gain god knows else.....and im even scared....so point im like hell it, lemme die. premise would require even distribution spread likely case based seen far. Oh please do, post sources. realize cuomo deblasio helped virus spread, right? heard Brazil while. Wonder “Shelter home” 

Not “lockdown”

Should be. Employers going legally required them. government deregulating, taking care workers. already disinfectant? inject that?  well 2 million now. According experts reddit. Main street needed help, fed handed checkbook Wall street. We'll watching documentaries years. Short answer: yes.

Long answer:

If friend hits someone car speeding, victim unlikely hit two people cars, go hit 4 people, hit 8 more, hit 16, thousands dead people scared go road economy collapses. could happen yea, I'd defriend speeding. I'd like see presidential helicopter pick White House drop prison. Bezos secretly going: longer pandemic, pandemic, never go away pandemic! Agreed. sucks get economy cant stayed closed forever people need make money, safety everyone come first. Unfortunately got governors like Abbott Texas, lose faith certain politicial parties. Coronials coronavirus US year now, anybody know even PLAN developed leaders time smooth lot issues faced first lockdown?? understand people lost jobs &amp; expected continue payments many things risk losing cars eventually evicted. think second lockdown tell us competence government leadership even local level mess. I'm Texas, btw. players keep getting sick COVID 19, able put team field? provide data source NYC number pls? doesnt seem like saying arent going continue indoors, sucks. issue people saying sucks Feeling like chest ""in vice grip"" one main symptoms Covid19! Better get tested. H1N1 pneumonia 2009 developed narcolepsy chronic kidney insufficiency :( curious, get yearly flu vaccine? also possibility give birth alone. 

***how figure that?*** 

hand mom towel say call need anything?

&amp;#x200B;

enough hysterics. One hope. One cannot find evidence it, however. particular, announcement made CDC almost middle NYC outbreak (a long time ago), making particularly egregious lie.

Apparently soviet union used that: make obvious lies people necessarily even mean anything, get used idea swallowing falsehood. shame country going path. 

Also, solid chance lower mortality (and chance keep rising time), likely cannot mitigation scenario healthcare system overwhelmed almost it. Houston run ICU beds less 1% population infected. get 30-70% herd immunity would take months years carefully cycling people hospitals, essentially impossible flat rate disease contagious. Americans becoming? complete utter fucking morons? shut fuck unintelligent dribble. going get 70% infected rate one way another.

Seems decided stupidest way possible.

We paid cost lockdown, we’re going overflow medical system. Also trend NE sector daily cases already gone visible peak. southern states TX NC blowing big time. Wow, I'm really sorry experiences. wonder particular location anything makes difference? (I'm Nova). work one told us go ahead file too. Gotcha. Thanks insightful responses taking time respond follow-up questions concern (sincerely). need make sounds like joke, America recovered patients

clearly winner competition, like liberate Berlin Auschwitz end WW2 plague rally for? :( Gee, wonder why. stumble. could marketed red MAGA masks..... Virus guys get memo? Everyone sick tired virus told go away relax let's celebrate. Nobody acting like victim, saying indoors days sucks. arent saying, indoors sucks therefore im going go cough apples walmart. 

People vent upset. Also lots us went outside lot lost jobs ya know. jobs never coming back though. gone. pandemic could tomorrow ill still unemployed Wait minute... bit shady area lab virus close happens developed first ""Working"" vaccine. Wow, people get drunk dance share beverages food grocery store? 

That’s different scene college town. Around time Boomers came age. SOMETHING! Even exponentially spread everyone could hear immunity reached, still wouldn’t take life driving time period.

And yes, accept calculated risks dying almost anything. Even ones risk people’s lives well own, like driving. wouldn’t consider sociopathic accept risk driving others. Yes! Texas though, let's wear masks! hate say don’t believe study, don’t believe study. us work home fine lockdown, lot people can’t. unemployment run eventually. Oh Toodles retail store also need allow store. no, understand, mean they'll die country long get bomb shit desert nation first.  Huffpost put together montage ""just joking"" Trump moments date. ""has done best repeal them"" tacitly said fine BS long giving money poor allow loan forgiveness students trouble people thousands medical debt. would say worst imaginable. total ignorance print money, bail tenants, bail millions people without jobs, bail small businesses printed money went big corpos. even finished first round Covid. Wait fall season. Look Europe covid. truly ready start easing restrictions. deep sh... him. Health Director powerless stop beach travel governor (I assume boss) allowing, even encouraging travel. 
 
Maybe want shame beachgoers, driving hiding make contact tracing efforts even harder.

Or maybe nice lady. mention grand scheme pandemics death rate low. thing higher death rate fools refusing wear masks would 500k dead already. Thank - email barber see do. it’s safe enough, sort like said, may go it. 

I one worry mask though. They’re likely going touch behind head move mask buzz around area. also around ears, they’ll also likely pull seconds. risky? mask isn’t....ideal. It’s actually neck gaiter. move things around little back head around ears access. otherwise it’s buzz Likewise.. funny thing, I've actually wilderness. get wrong, pretty awesome. Beautiful countryside, amazing fishing, moose, eagles clean air. actually planning coming sometime see city life bring family. interest leaving country blows whatever... unless really too, point would utter chaos ya know Hmm, guess people 46-54 aren’t part survey... “People dying like never died before”

What? brainer wanted us learn something, told us got virus front. totally wasted X minutes life without finding punch line. ARGH. Flu mild year social distancing mask wearing. county. Damn tourists gonna ruin rest us. Mom blogger. draw everything out. Gotta make sure minimum amount buzz words met. SeaWorld today kid front Manta line pulled mask sneeze parents didnt even scold him. I'm going back. hour. Disneyland cancelled reopening. Disney World won’t far behind. neighbor, yourself. Yeah Cooper walk tightrope here...I know sucks alternative November theocrat Lt. Governor literally telling Baptist pastors covid guidelines deliberate attempt shut churches permanently bring end times I’m willing give Cooper little bit leeway. problem continues people refusing wear masks without treated like disobedient toddlers. always way. Local newspapers read widely. Coronavirus first time I've given damn local news, google name state paper. thought already many many vaccines working underway. someone explain news. me, Italy shutting down, Pope Francis rumored COVID 19. Thank god, Pope ended testing negative. Depending live Houston, thats normal day.  Guess I'm lucky job changed since corona. Although kinda wish got work couple months. part specifically? post sources stats I’m referencing make look stupid. Good I've left house 20 times last 105 days. vaccine, treatment, surprise spike - seriously could expect? feel you.

Even though NRG one got closed earlier, evacuate supplies such. Wtf ignorant what?  Sad staff, hell dine-in restaurant enforce masks anyway? Sweden's numbers suggest 0.5-1% east west coasts knowledgeable, sensible peoples. Midwest people’s dumbfucks, eurotrash. straight White House making fun reporters wearing masks, telling people virus going away, political rallies thousands people, etc.

Not mention telling country, concept shame remorse, *actively reducing amount testing.* one method knowing bad things actually are, leader blocking path. 

***The President United States literally care whether American citizens live die.***

I'm horrified zero hyperbole statement. I'm going avoid getting political leave one statement.

""Good luck."" Seriously? Florida, California, Texas, Arizona:
[here's 

At point accept fact one who's going save you. doubt it. 

That number way low. Wow. I'm impressed parents. done special ed summer school 2 parents refuse bring kid back whereas 40 said kid would summer school person. 1% death rate unreasonable estimate. could easily end half county infected next year way things heading.

 could 1,500,000 dead. really hope next month go bad looking like control gained. Stay safe people. You’re looking things purely surface objectively perspective. Yes, right, larger issue flooding stress hospitals, doctors nurses. everyone get ideal treatment, statement goes window. 

The reason New York high percentage isn’t solely lack scientific knowledge month two ago, lot surge inability adapt November 3! matter? Never mind people attached lives. Kids lose parents vice versa. Friends. Etc. them? matter?

It’s damn competition. Many Covid deaths would preventable, even without even hit financials. people won’t takes heaven forbid asked inconvenience even tiny bit. 

Sorry. won’t win battle me. Remind me! 15 weeks limit number tourists eased restrictions. see mobile. Though generally speaking China's approach concentrate certain amount resources hot spots. Beijing last week, hospital send people outbreak areas. 

I tested Beijing last week got lucky 24 hour turn around. Waited line maybe hour. knew people tested later day 48 hours turnaround 2 hour wait. knew people booked later day day, week wait test. 

Two days ago tested Shanghai. 24 hours turn around. exactly one customer testing station, work sheet desk maybe 20 stickers workers clearly bored goofing around bit. 6,100 know [one person no-mask situation. therefore 2nd lockdown people would lead policy success? I've got bridge might interested in. Wow understand Estimates infection fatality rates inferred seroprevalence studies tend much lower **original *speculations* made early days pandemic.** ""

Here let break infection fatality rates **inferred from** seroprevalence **studies**

aka scientific data **speculations** made early days pandemic.

aka early speculation

Combine things conclusion study translates to, plain data shows actual fatality rates covid-19 much lower early speculations fatality rates

And genius, unconstitutional shutdowns order mitigate RISK uncontrolled spread 5% people NEED MEDICAL HELP can't get healthcare system flooded.

is worst thing [hospitals resorting order handle negative financial effects shutdowns Pretty much. there's lesson learned pandemic, going way treat people cruelly different concerned well-being. NJ same. family first outdoor meal since February past weekend, masks (until food served) disposable menus/utensils etc. Felt tremendously earned able get point months work (and still many go) 38,193 now. hell survey? way would many people support another lockdown.  poor council members. I’m sure ladies goto every meeting absolute psychos everything. Nice mural virus.  serious? 65% Americans middle class jobs afford stay home. ain't done yet day Depends ya live, Elon. Rioters wear masks. they’re rioting. Even proper safely guidelines, actually enforced. tell everyone wear mask, lucky get half wear unless way actually enforce it.  sharing drinks packed bar != going pool party, especially depending live Oh course is, also know get sick chances would better. infuriates amount people willing sacrifice old economy, hell even economy get haircut American, it’s frustrating see people wearing masks complaining wearing masks. know many people smart staying home wearing masks. It’s even difficult rest world calls US Americans idiots. lot us smart this, subject really shitty government. 

For someone like me, followed social distancing mask wearing, EU travel ban (even though agree it) disheartening many family members boyfriend Europe. It’s hard knowing I’ll able see again. boyfriend abruptly separated move back due virus.

So rest world, please know us US smart virus trying best educate neighbors peers. Ill damned I’m
Gonna voluntarily go work right lease up. 

God knows governors POTUS won’t fuck 65% Americans would also rather send positive cases nursing homes. can’t it, wanted know situation writing many theatrics drawn I'm unaware loss experienced bottom Disney food chain, whether vendors, operators, hourly employees, terrible.

I'm also unaware Disney's immense wealth, whether holdings, cash reserves, income generated services offered outside parks.

If Disney employee suffers financial hardship result lack work, Disney's fault. living political powder keg raging politicized virus exploding population.

I September pool anti-maskers start attacking people public tearing masks. us! think Trump single handedly responsible outbreak Cornoavirus planet Earth?

Do sources back up, crazy fun it? Yo seriously know post publically saw gentleman would attack. i'm good (jiu jitsu) Dot com punchable face. really. umbrella doesn’t holes it. mask does. 

For example. walked barbecue restaurant mask could immediately smell distinct aroma meat/smoke, despite wearing mask mask didn’t really much it. thing flu. Viral particles tiny pass right through, fibers. mention top sides masks.  Thus wearing masks probably false sense security. zero experimental evidence actually work. Beaches limited 50 people per 4-mile radius. person saying China cared people, told China didn’t treat people well. Good point  Happened? always like this. right face now, look it. 65% Americans idiots. They're afraid virus they've probably already even know it. stupidity. stupid. Regardless lie reckless

If they're looking infected people self-quarantine, masks protect getting infected others, lie.

The context change pre- a-symptomatic people spread, masks everyone become measure protect infected others, protect infecting others.

Circumstances change. People adapt. positions change mean previous positions lies. Get &amp; move on. sort shit get politicians change course becomes apparent original strategy clearly wrong, political cost seen flip flopper higher actually keeping wrong thing. make law, going enforce it?

Just curious? 

I know say want cops there.

Edit are!!! hate one, time! Nah use reeditisfun. grow Expect numbers increase today forward wonder 'hoax' people say staff starting catch it. must conflicted. Sigh. time sound like raving lunatic. I'm like...well...maybe *that* bad. Hopefully? correct places major protests spikes.

However common among places spiking like Florida, Texas Arizona overly aggressive re-opening schedules failure promote mask wearing. hope stay 45 likes cause fuckin 45's twitterverse gave info article breaks trajectories country throughout [Latin - Brazil expected exceed 166,000 deaths Mexico 88,000, according forecast University Washington’s Institute Health Metrics Evaluation Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Guatemala Peru forecast see 10,000 fatalities, 15 nations including Paraguay, Uruguay Belize seen fewer 1,000 deaths each. willing listen experts order serve citizens.

Umm...except [attacking fruit fly putting money health complaining it.

I think exactly implying. Especially since PUA kicker expired yet, making choice, complaining cant believe people making similar decisions risk public health personal satisfaction. One worst parts able loved one suffer. Think - unbearable pain unspeakable whole family. utter fuck wrong people?

How much time got ? No, home births aren’t covered insurance. I’ve already hospitalized pregnancy. good thing everyone hospital wears mask. feels like one safest places town. Time reverse reputation internet come.

Have axe! Idiot comment. guys breakdowns pros cons NBA understand hundreds thousands people died right? seems brain incapable finding space “it’s literal apocalypse” “it’s cold.” isn’t bad advice. There’s pandemic, stay home can. 

There’s really reason make unnecessary travel don’t to. meant travel advisory We’ve urging virus leave us alone since February hasn’t yet. I’m wondering “urging” even effective? Maybe action what’s required. many people think they/their families sick.

It's people sick. watch video? Seems like family member spoke attend, shamed ones did, putting family’s situation forth warning families considering get togethers. 

Maybe something good come public shaming. 

I’m sending relatives planning family reunion November. Maybe stop. 

(Probably not...) swap numbers, logic still applies.  Interesting! guess sample size one enough. ;) Thank info! first thought dropped mask requirement people color. saw mask requirement people color. Wtf  directly addressed everything said. places either fires tries organize shut whole workplace reopen somewhere else. Ahh, well reached monthly quota propaganda spreading yet? form personal attack suggest opponent happy, rather concerned, tragedy unfolding. Please stop. high risk people effectively isolating Damn. seem bit pissed Canada. don’t data back claim up. [It kills 20x people Needs study sure least surmise lifestyle changes might needed addition pharmaceutical advancements Well correct seen cases reinfection now? say experience nursing union takes lot money paychecks protects really bad nurses aught fired. I’ve seen actually help employee unjustly targeted administration. Every time protecting crotchety old mean nurses don’t want modernize practice. Right union defending nurses feel shouldn’t screened Covid enter hospital.  experience I’ve changed someone fully supported unions someone skeptical goals. Nope, wrong. I'm liberal living ethnically diverse liberal community.  Let ask this. Would rather live rest life die, would rather die tomorrow? Great point fuck face. Yes! exactly, neither used disprove clueless, one actually might see data comes in. referring specifically cloth surgical masks. studies showing 30-40% asymptomatic cases actually showing signs lung damage despite showing jo symptoms.

So no, ventilators referring right now. know track? three states going start tracking data movement every individual states list? 

And determine someone past 2 week part. I’m NC drive NYS people know haven’t already quarantining? long I’ve there? “But it’s interfering God’s breathing apparatus!” smh brother one who’s commenting situation, wife refused go party risk. nephew hosted it. I'm trademarking Buttfuckers. everyone agenda people things believe it’s right. fact jump right conclusion must agenda says lot usually assume things people based experiences personalities. think many workers anti union since people work company long, something that's easy organize lot enthusiasm for. Also get fired retaliated ""causing trouble."" smoking? trump ever listened expert? campaign staff Mitch McConnell probably told damaging re-election prospects. said let experts talk, threw fit cancelled briefings. Lol dumbass Lol what? hate Musk much anyone else think total PoS well, can't argue Tesla products innovative cutting-edge market 2020. distance I'm talking grocery shopping. That's wrote can't keep distance wear mask. I'm saying staying away people entirely obviously effective near mask. wrote, particularly true cloth masks. Surgical masks well. little protect wearer. misinformation. Sweden [number two world rolling 7 day average deaths per best way see current situation ground clear Sweden trouble metric basically whole world (only Brazil worse right now). 

Further, forecasts deaths trending upwards: wonder age excess deaths Italy countries - possible younger cases missed caused covid (and counted heart attack example)? Probably significant enough scale, right? What's point??? happily go back lockdown wear masks. knew 2nd wave would come. Americans even think covid-19 real husband’s family reunion Ohio week! People driving country! husband asked might good idea reschedule, mother acted like crazy. obviously aren’t going... I'm hesitant though. already antibiotic-resistant superbugs. want create UV resistant superbugs. message replied rightly pointed average time infection death delayed. average delay 18 days. 

Sadly, don’t see outcome yet. comes, happen two weeks. hope right, much afraid not. thing happened around world. 

Nobody happy I’m certainly not. poor rhetorical tool normalized way defend argument and, case, directly lead response we've seen anti-masking community. great example Dunning–Kruger effect. Fauci said days ago he’s still cautiously optimistic vaccine ready public end year January 2021. don’t recall hearing spring. It’ll probably take spring months get everyone vaccinated, don’t think spring it’ll start. Sure Israel thing Shin Bet tracking everyones phone. goes whole privacy thing Big Brother watching times. 

Also way tell you? contact 11 people past 7 days would relevant here. add cashier supermarket want. take subway. 

And want isolate japanese case. admit multiple theories seemed hit hard, countries listed countries swift lockdowns mean like, police unions? Hmm Bullshit Coronavirus numbers false !! Lead propaganda puppets interested numbers! Covid global preventable disaster - story governments worldwide failing listen experts, exceptions places, mostly failure listen informed scientific opinion. Barbosa, married doctor, said wife didn’t go party worried virus. Now, says speak mother father, 80s, phone.


Who wants bet two family members ridiculed behind backs party. live? cases people wearing masks social distancing? go back gym personally especially people wear masks. enclosed room AC running spread droplets people breath exhale heavily exercising .

Would love go back sometime soon! birthday celebration end May. friend birthdays two days apart. drove (about 100 miles). never entered house.

Instead drove --- separate cars --- favorite restaurant ordered takeout. Walked nearby park eat.

Then spent day driving -- still separate cars -- around town see outdoor art exhibits. stopped store likes street look around came home finished cooking dinner.

A couple friends came sat around outside socially distanced food talk. neighbor across street saw explained corona birthday. He's professional singer, serenaded Happy Birthday across street. brought piece cake slipped garage door.

Point entire birthday celebrated doors, breeze (thankfully already summer here) people socially distanced absolutely physical contact. 

And one got sick.

We indoors pressed taking photos. Probably hugged family shouldering health crisis never expected face

Because stupid. I've trying figure real, can't figure either sad day freedom /s see it’s time daily Sweden spam 🙄   course lmao fuck is..this spread texas 100 percent riots .Houston leading pack followed Dallas Austin. Wow stunning !!!!all 3 cities largest rallies. media dare bring labeled racist try paint problem wheel chair Man's fault. Mr wheel chair state opening 5 weeks insanely low numbers mob rule remodelers decide gather mass say fuck social distancing. I’m talking ""A North Texas family battling health crisis never expected ""

Yes.  could possibly seen coming? total shock. labor union party? Doorknobs useful though distance wins hands down...  

In theory, actual real-life situations.  

I go grocery shopping without mask try stay away people. That’s great idea someone coming around corner bumps me. employee walks me. maybe I’m walking 6ft behind person front happens Covid.  

Theoretically social distancing best. **Practically, however, mask wear may good better.** Well, yes. And, starting look asymptomatic individuals may never contagious, pre-symptomatic people may highly contagious, may linkes blood type factors...

The real lesson containment exactly pointed out. best way infect lot people get together indoors prolonged period time. best way slow spread virus follow physical distancing guidelines health organizations advising since early year, encourage widespread use masks people break isolation indoors others. 

Not arguing, amplifying. Stupid stupid Care like != personal attack interesting (and frightening) see reactions still calling covid hoax, states require masks public. many willfully ignorant people. Lol even email second wave hit Europe us wasn’t even able put first one  One time, found piece toast ear. That's always one calling sheep telling stop ""panicking"" and"" fearmongering.""

I'm like ""no I'm panicked wear mask social dis-""

""FAYKE NEWWS! SHEEEP!"" one wears mask properly anyway masks vents absolutely nothing. think produces electricity needed

Lots nuclear renewables mix.  antibody production triggered, means memory cells also produced help fight subsequent infections thus making harmless. antibodies, faster inject monoclonal antibodies? Ordered March, checked 2-3 weeks ago. told could expect wait months. stop diseased entourage state border. artist/author dead

But doesn’t work things like actors comedians. Like can’t separate Cosby Show, previously nostalgia-soaked treasure childhood, Bill Cosby rapist. show ruined now. watch anything Louie CK without imagining walking multiple women masturbating, kinda kills vibe. really, boyfriend wants go :/ places Europe, maybe. WWE essential business though apparently. know better Fauci yesterday. Wow! Maybe replace him! love pandemic proves natural selection, BLM protests like want virus win couldn’t go protests, made significant financial contributions bail funds. 

Also, that’s HIPPA works. five people test positive went protest given day, authorities say press release that: “five people attended X protest X day tested positive.”

HIPPA means authorities cannot release name, identifying information. local news publish articles say “X amount people got sick Applebee’s X date.”

You haven’t really made solid arguments here. even Texas? doesn’t sound like know what’s going all. Huh???? WTF? real life right now? Wear fucking mask in: 65% americans semblance common sense Different locations. control need watch leakages state borders. Australia impose state border restrictions, either stopping traffic impose quarantine. yeah. old fat guy (who despite losing 95 lbs recently still yet can’t anything age) , feel like might part problem... 

And virus sees everything opportunity. Virus virus. wants all. Underlying conditions don’t help course. yeah. you. ugly appears.  There's many cases people getting virus twice  number new cases rise since various States decided soften quarantine measures. likely result higher deaths coming weeks I’m afraid... Well,it isn’t proven get virus once, although viral relapses possible don’t know long immunity lasts. think hanging outside small groups bad risk take. People need social interaction keep stress levels inflammation levels down! Jokes you, us live CA still lockdown! I’m idiot totally misread comment initially, 100% agreement you. Disney World also take lead, there’s need put danger right Pritzker handled really well. attitude may indeed shorten time required. 35% Murican party ""freedoms"" month over. Agreed I’m completely stumped trying think possible reasons aren’t effected I’m high school people literally parties (indoor distancing) sharing drinks/joints. live area people pretty conscious taken pretty seriously recently South Carolina end peaked 3% tests coming back positive. 


This week, it’s 15% positive. 

In Arizona got 20% tests returning positive. 

You better believe wave deaths coming. Since stupidest timeline expect see President start fight Mickey Mouse twitter within next 24 hours. don’t understand. hasn’t happened all? Sounds racist discriminatory me. “ unenforceable, it’s constitutional rights, nobody make wear mask” It’s stupid fucking hill die better believe people going it. /r/conspiracy balls deep idea middle government conspiracy control us fake. Lol White House acts like WANT people get sick COVID. thing enough homes everyone. problem landlords corporations owning one home holding hostage profit. little late... Arizona doctor here

I got daily email 2 hours ago. biggest health care system (huge) 90% capacity that’s expanded capacity. ICU’s 90% also. 

Admits lag confirmed cases. expect thorough shit show 10-14 days imagine wanting learn coronaviruses dont know fuck surveying Wow, I'm surprised. guess realized reputation important couple months revenue one park. Good call. Looks like reopening going well! Well... there’s plenty edgelords there. It’s boomers. say religion causes harm...LOL want police harassing black people masks ""suspicious"" risk triggering protests. guarantee neighborhood racists lose shit calling police masked black guys going business. 

I understand they're coming from, think preventing spread corona worth inevitable fallout giving police blank check harass black people. Yes, forcing wear masks cause problems exempting cause even bigger problems them, everybody. point, would put trust Bert Ernie. seem act together. post removed cannot verify reliable source.

I never said problem 50 states rather three states working together.

Exactly point.  kind overarching Federal government something, surely could achieve this. Thank service, sir. can't make commercial thanking without actually anything you, pretend did. Exactly many states decided open mid may/june 1st, first thing thought 4th july, USA would deeper shit ever. wish right. ashamed may ""leaders"". entering darkest phase pandemic. Lol.

Texas resident, we’ve really gotta get handle shit. Folks getting sick unacceptable rate, it’s partially governments fault late shitty response well people’s fault refusing wear mask. 

If live Texas, wear fucking mask.  record? Damn, israel well control Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Yeah, lot problems Texas. Abbott start.

Be sure note: Abbott's reopened sort things including carnivals - except public tours Governor's Mansion. even states like Michigan really tried, got massive pushback weakened response. It’s ridiculous. assuming US president cares US citizens. far likely administration grant unknown dubious US company ""develop""( really import ) vaccines sell slight mark-up way US citizens pay upfront reality coming taxes anyway.  Pretty much everywhere, US included, seen lower rates projected (remember forecasts millions dead).

To me, sentence far meaningful statistically: 
""Countries widespread mask wearing saw mortality rates grow 8% week, average, versus 54% growth countries."" Smart move. Disney World reopen, either. Cases exploding states people grasp fact wear simple face covering.  Thank you. can't believe number people saying dramatic regret forever. Like, wedding haha. Although probably people refuse wear masks stores think COVID like flu. get COVID heart work harder oxygenate blood. People's resting BPM increases exercise levels mostly aware it. weak heart fail COVID. Restaurants Wisconsin packed staff wears mask customers don’t. Kenosha least practice 50% capacity. That's whining Conservatives. abuse, caught. better help later. Come people. need work. Sadly can’t survive America without making decent money. people risk quarantine anybody lives elderly etc.  personal opinion majority Americans using excuse work get nice unemployment check they’re spilling out. way downplaying severity Covid, make decisions keep America moving forward.

Perfectly reasonable give risk well. utterly unsurprising. people feel safe succesful moderate lockdown transitioning functional Test, Trace, Isolate strategy life starts going back relatively normal levels. record increases: Statistics Denmark, retail sales overall rose 9.4 percent month shopping malls reopened, hitting new record largest month-on-month increase since first started reporting retail statistics start year 2000.

You need supporting data make point. irony hypocrisy sub fucking unbelievable. makes assume support Trump Desantis (btw don't)? Next, ""cultist""? even realize irony statement? basically lap whatever narrative media feeds run without question. Sound like cult behavior chance?

All I'm saying things never black white. course, media going run hard story Hollywood-esque.

I'm saying greedy 35% time take half cover initial investment profits hand. sounds like white wealthy boomer Gov coverup, would thought Here’s link: need focus stop spread COVID-19 save many lives possible. It’s slightly disturbing people view COVID-19 opportunity. Good business decision slightly irresponsible. certainly look like are. fatter then? bank, grocery store, gas station  fair seen mandatory mask orders states either. whole we've failed see value masks, lot intentional misinformation CDC.

Crazy thing Utah Governor running re-election fall still acting like this. Saying things like requiring Salt Lake City (a hotspot) require masks done data backs request requiring masks cause ""divisive enforcement"" issues. madness! Part issue governors different states different rules announce things like ""Okay, gatherings 25 allowed!"" people gathering 25. see Facebook (and unfortunately kids see friends) seems like nobody social distancing area anymore.

The media inaccurately depicting happening.

I've linked several sources thread. First someone sitting bar...

But can’t believe bars even open right now.

So seems know blame this. KKKapitalism. Got it. lie message? Please point explain. gotten rogue package government yet? one script tell foreigners ask something country, cyanide capsule? Freedom mortal coil. neither! disregard anyone legendary. would buy one cars him. actually know there's line sand NFL would cross

Maybe death star player? rooting much shaking head people goober bars, etc.

600k very, possible. past 20% officially, unofficially likely past 25%, even fall yet. I'm Italy well, actually looking data be, time being, afraid let's say US. 200 cases per day nation ( 90% Lombardia), means situation control. think wearing masks safe go bars, shops&amp;co, numbers start rising again, will. Actually impressed well country dealt first wave, keeping also account first country europe get big spread out. Okay, 11.5 million apartment renters? Amazon employees live Bay Area?

Your argument “This 0.01% renting population proves 33% renting population 750+ credit scores work high paying jobs insulated economic hardship” serves illustrate fragile grip concept statistical significance. I've never considered Brazil developed country. pandemic writes itself. Denmark got much lower life expectancy nordic neighbours, despite basically real winter. simply live less healthy life style others. Im really surprised got hit harder nordic countries strategy happen get broadside bombarded “deadly dust storm” every year. Straight tip spear here. Surrounded old people dust storm sensational news. Fear Money! think pretty dumb too. fault somehow goddamn pandemic disease turned political. Like... how? Might well! don’t touch balls. options this:

Either virus terrifying small localized outbreak requires extreme significant containment measures.

Or China loves people US loves theirs.

Choose ever story want tell yourself. Saucy. comments symptomatic disorder causes premature reopenings failure wear masks. like everyone ADD. need mom blogger write like reporter AP able find useful information.

Listen idiots, point pieces like give chance putting shoes someone who's virus fucking family. think experience short 30-second news video? No, takes *forever* deal crap. slow miserable weird scary hell deeply it, first everything seems kind normal boring--that's point. 

Every single person quit reading paragraphs forced read every single word exercise mental discipline. Every single person rolled eyes quit reading mentioned menopause forced read entire piece five times learn empathy. People need stop impatient judgmental ignorance KILLS. true. Wearing masks essentially putting distance without actually distancing, basically thing. I'm boat, course soon respiratory pandemic started developed cough Well, Texas. hope I'm wrong...

Good news. data suggesting

All early data I've seen small studies worst case scenario populations. look real world population statistical significance, numbers far less alarming.  Wow, real rollercoaster. Think I’ve got whiplash. California two weeks ago same. 

Creating culture mask wearing takes time see problems everywhere. 

People going accept another lockdown way forward mask wearing. 

You need 100% either, reduction R0 even 50% mask use could keep things stable would prevent exponential growth. 

Keep lead example. Indeed Stop Shop told give quarters coin shortage need machine building. anyone idea could possibly get quarters?  stupid overstated analogy

It's called hyperbole.

I believe rhetorical purpose illustrate whole thread stupid argument. go sucking dick yet. Europe shit show too. Abstract
The coronavirus pandemic poses multiple challenges policing, including need continue responding calls public. Several contingency plans warned police expect large potentially overwhelming increase demand public pandemic, (to author’s knowledge) empirical work police demand major public health emergency. study used calls-for-service data 10 large cities USA analyse calls service changed early months 2020 COVID-19 outbreak, compared forecasts call volume based data previous years. Contrary previous warnings, overall number calls went early weeks pandemic. substantial reductions specific call types, traffic collisions, significant increases others, calls dead bodies. types calls, particularly relating crime order maintenance, continued largely before. Changes frequency different call types present challenges law enforcement agencies, particularly since many suffering reduced staffing due pandemic. Understanding changes calls detail allow police leaders put place evidence-based plans ensure continue serve public. That's true, Disney closed accord two weeks governor announced statewide shutdown order. Maybe they'll again, especially Florida's current caseload national outcry. mouse want bad publicity. Anybody traveling anything life death issues right making pandemic worse selfish reasons.

I hope everyone keeping track people lives call rub noses days things continue get worse. Still time protests pay off. Let’s see you’re chuckling two weeks! referring genetic heterogeneity include age population class? Stupid moronic family. preserved ""freedom""...

And S/O, like how? Round 2? “I’m going nothing post 10 threads day exclusively negative content, months end!

But insinuating enjoy negative content? DARE you!” Haha tried pin stock 420 Please recently seen spike surgeries well people putting first order. Since covid (and comorbidities) billed J12.89 (other viral pneumonia), J22 (unspecified acute lower respiratory infection), others, amount insurance willing pay case hospitals cost. So, many hospitals actually losing net profits patient treat. Elective surgeries also one highest net profit activities hospital. insurance billing codes change, could start see hospitals declaring bankruptcy/needing loans/bail continue providing services. onus employee’s safety, health, well clearly defined OHSA various federal regulatory commissions. 

In circumstance TESLA knowingly defied state county health orders, continues defy federal regulatory recommendations via cdc.

If none something worth considering it’s also often 3-5 times expensive train new employee retain existing employees; matter cut TESLA acting irresponsibly regards production targets, willfully ignorant modern conditions. let's yeet landlords conrad Surprise! accept HUUUUUGE stretch, heard ppl saying stuff freedom religion (I'm American might exact) Shame, wanted buy Tesla guess never now.

That’s started tweeting stupid shit pandemic sold. mean love idiots think know everything without knowing anything someone. Yeah hit nail head, also doinked you. since you’re smart, go ahead explain Tesla fraud. I’d love hear explanation proof accusations. I’ll waiting. Maybe people offered sort health insurance would less fearful go work. How’s counter point. told possible fun places besides Disney land? It’s global pandemic killed 483k people. going Disneyland tiny sacrifice. Live it.  surprise birthday party Funny bring Spanish Flu ignore economic studies afterwards. conclusively showed places stricter, longer lockdowns measures less overall economic damage places panicking economy opening soon. really doubt face masks work. example, ever smell fart 20 feet away? little burst stinky air travel pair butt cheeks, underwear, pair pants, yet still smell it!

Illinois declining since late April that’s even opening slightly. since flat last week that’s expected you’re consistent positivity rate 2%. virus still there, don’t expect get much lower that. Plus masks mandatory here. think helps lot. 

Also. Wisconsin really bad considering fully open stay home order lifted mid May. Everyone scared numbers would sky rocket, didn’t. It’s mostly flat. Indiana another state almost fully open fine. Plus lot people IL traveling there. 

I’d personally rather people IL go Wisconsin Indiana south right now. Pritzker followed science Illinois reopening that, truly think IL better long run. would even go far saying don’t think massive rise cases it. aren’t dying doesn’t mean carriers spreaders covid. 

You absolutely continue continue then.

[Here's one heavily upvoted comment claiming masks enough]( thread. People question evidence (which definitely masks policies, that's tried yet) get comments like science works.

Probably around 2 months ago, death count around 30-40k, listened interview one America's top epidemiologists (don't recall name; episode fivethirtyeight podcast pandemic modeling). time, 100k 200k thrown around rough death count projections. epidemiologist, said using rigorous up-to-date model, said 200k figure come nowhere even 100k likely overestimate. gave something like 65k 69k mean death toll simulations. Mind you, 95% confidence interval pretty wide, upper bound around 115-120k.

[Here](http://imgur.com/gallery/oCFwPrb) Florida's daily hospitalization numbers. 18% 29% 38% 39% 1 week, 2 week, 3 week, 4 week periods ending yesterday. based 7 day rolling average. Anybody thought Elon musk “good” billionaire, needs wake there’s good billionaires. don’t get position without ruthless hurting lot people. shame, seem like nice people. They've failed shambolic government levels. Wrong. I’m doctor, Fox News told wearing mask didn’t anything Fox News would never lie me!!!!!11122 goes Wholesome 100 elon musk! god I’m sorry loss. someone victim countrymen, feel people going downtown stuff? Wow, $90k year Cali. might able afford nice cardboard box overpass. west coast deal first. beach probably quite safe. Especially beach goers masked. 

It’s eating drinking crowded beach towns complicates things. company even close making good electric car

Um...good electric cars existed quite awhile.

Congratulations, type person susceptible marketing. frustrating self-isolated months assholes decide life threatning virus. continue self isolate much possible, man taxing mental health. Sadly everything nowadays, nuance lost debate, instead everything's black white. Like thread see alot Tesla evil company, Tesla friend hats them.

In reality, truth somewhere between. instance could looking simple case hanlons razor; attribute malice action easily attributed incompetence.

So case could met manager agreed go unpaid leave, took settled matter. HR never got memo, saw AWOL took disciplinary action. 

While unfortunate, could error rather than, evil company stomping little guy like lot posters suggest. Tbf NYC much higher population density anywhere texas. also took precautions didn’t ignore science plays sad interesting thing watch. 

What end worse, precautions high density area much public transportation, / precautions spread state. 

Of course places like Houston huge could easily spiral, it’s worth noting rural places, safer lower pop density, much lower capacity hospitals. 

I’m claiming know it’ll play out, suspect Texas, Florida particular going really rough time next months.  Welcome bad companies. Remember time thought companies people. don’t fire poor service people hire? Gradual increases indicators future rapid spikes like we've seen south though. small bumps road. mask-wearing situation look like PA right now? Np. It’s nice lil sanity every then. There’s lot entitlement youth. right lie though? glossed that, important. record idea whether lied not. surprised see protest Great Britain last week week before, saw article subreddit save it. make wild guess, I'd speculate right wing might behind it. you’re son billionaire everyone lining kiss ass. pretty open, man. Police unions fine, neither teachers unions. Public servants allowed unionize, undermines democratic process. everywhere, every job. think role model is? They'd rather step on, piss on, kick care you. even Musk says fired, dude. literally terminated position CEO - also board make phrase ""fired CEO"" invalid. school district employee!! GOOD EFFING LORD!! Imagine life microscope, whether liked not, mistakes reported public.

We would reddit comments like this, bashing personalities people we’ve never met before. 

No one perfect. Congrats, found he’s perfect human flaws  wearing cloth surgical mask protects you. helps keep breath in. 

Few people wearing N95s public defensively protect themselves. think Musk huge asshole. time need lie history. asshole-ish acts well known speak themselves.

Seriously! know paint grifter company actually delivering promise. He's Bernie Madoff Elizabeth Holmes.

I agree he's throwing tantrum creating unsafe workplace mean he's con-artist milking people money tony stark least actually dad kid [On graphic, according got reach tipping point know people hospitals overwhelmed? something tells wrong like dime dozen sub. bunch seagull mission commanders. thing billionaire gives fuck workers rights. Mazda teaming Toyota. Hopefully get phev Miatas CX-5 soon! Yeah, great state reopening, past weeks likely outcome governor: growing number infections. ones instigating people controlled, doubt scientists experts? forgotten... Ok? get stay home like wanted Narrator: shouldn’t surprise. Wanna go Starbucks? percentage reduction testing purely political reasons morally wrong. care .01% .00001%. actually willing support trump blatant corruption there's getting you. bad one warned them. “Company companies regular basis anyways”

Color shocked. Defund space! developed Type 1 diabetes 16, dropped 110 pounds (as 5'11 dude), fasting BG 800 sleeping nearly 18 hours day. scary hell! 

I think healthy respect dangers disease pose fare much better, agree average middle aged type 2 diabetic well controlled US. really worry hospital rates rural sputg exploding much higher incidence comorbidities. everyone will

No, meant everyone *can.* everyone developed whatever skill did, likely fucked Walmart. Elon's stepfather's daughter Whiplash product Howard Stark screwing Whiplash’s dad, Tony.

I’m also unclear Stark Hydra/SHIELD screwed Vulture. Totally idiots LA county amidst COVID-19 regulations. sources sources sources sources thought already, shit's like onion. none


that almost far generous considering we’ve yet see example decent human also billionaire get downvoted, lot, whenever bring up. Even went 6 -3 8. think lot Reddit young without lot work experience. it’s definitely fair say redditors haven’t owned business etc. 

But think general population anti-businesses feel deserve middle class life minimum wage job etc. Well apparently works construction. People oftentimes get slight throat infections breathe lots dust thought harmless. ya still dumb af way think pandemic complain less scientist, really golden age publishing studies confirm reconfirm common sense. almost that's experts ya fucking weirdo absolutly right, living Europe real burden, please stay are. Elon Musk promotes toxic, unhealthy workplace culture big tech. idea retains top talent BS like this.

I think Teslas cool cars, there's way best engineers working them, they're surely moving Google, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon instead. riskier gamble driving. Throwing resources adequate testing production masks every single citizen actually could make *huge* difference.

Plus massive campaign actually inform people wear mask, apparently teaching people wear mask time people think need scientist figure out. 

I think underestimate possibilities. virus transferred human waste. wouldn’t want friends using bathroom right now. parties you’re could totally spread this. happened people hear exactly want hear. I'm buying two users post history need know articles

Just honest... reason suppress critical information discussions Sweden.

There literally thousands posts hour reddit never even look at. Nothing bothers feel need try stop posted.

So, stop bullshit ""spam"" simply move another thread like discussion one. buddy box 10 left gave me.  

i 3 r95 mask original packages last summers painting job 

i bought 5 ebay 90 bucks. plenty fake mask buddy work state collecting mask warehouse. looked said real. 

plus ordered cambridge mask late august. ask send shit hospital, people want WAKE SHEEPLE
KILLARY STEALING MUNNIES MURICA. PIZZAGATE 5G WATUP YALL Woah, edgy! Crazy people might want “distraction” every peak intellectual rigor utility. Even without happening, google quality issues. They're delivering $60k cars misaligned panels chipped paints. Yikes! Good guy Tesla vaccination test could prove would kill SARS-CoV-2 virus inside body. Elon Musk good human. Reddit please stop idolizing him. workers provided evidence continuing correspondence managers. 

selective reading ey señor did. gripe headline representative content article, commenters obviously commenting headline, meat potatoes story newsworthy anyway. Alright fair point. testing done corresponding % positive tests also up. 

Does positive case determine outcome? No.
Would expect cases light people circulating again? Yes.

My point 5k cases isn’t indicator outcome... 4x many cases doesn’t mean you’ll 4x many hospitalizations deaths etc.

There’s lot consider, age persons, testing readily available symptoms hospitalized? 

I’m board saying issue isn’t getting better Florida, feel relying “cases” metric alarm flawed.

Hospitalizations, ICUs deaths focused measure severity outbreak. 

The 5k cases alarmed you? Well tested entire state would have?

20k? 50k? rely statistic know incomplete, it’s ALWAYS fraction reality. went COVID 19 ward admitted patient separating patients tents. doctor told whole place contaminated need get soon possible. tent? Outside hospital. return two weeks later, nurses proper equipment protect small paper thin suit. That’s took care patients Ebola much much worse. think adequate?

And question comes up, well go there? every hospital. I’ve worked every hospital. problems: enough staff, doubling acute patients, low pay, undervalued, CEOs making much money. giving profit give adequate equipment staff provide best patient care priority. is? stocks. guy felt like wearing mask onsite emasculating something? 

This exactly think. I'm woman worked metal fabricator years. first day, using grinder, stopped asked guy ear plugs goes ""hurr hurr what, loud ya?"" said ""uhh yes?"". stupid. Yeah concerned well, hotels bathroom/gas stops. guess I'll wear mask bathroom. Thank you! Yeah, data ""doesn't work"" ""not worth trying."" idea keep putting statements like this. April - july meant nothing U.S. 😞 wasted effort mostly flying half capacity less, competition take people flights. True Well issue labor provided experienced employee worth labor 2-3 new recruits. 

That isn’t Walmart evil it’s staying Walmart longer doesn’t increase output value unfortunately. That’s case lot retail jobs. dont understand everyone superiority complex florida. New york shit job handling well... still criticize florida. It’s literally impossible billionaires hoard money. think Elon 50 billion bed? can’t give single example hoarding money Cases decrease decrease testing though. virus need make big brain plays. That’s really sad Considering NY driven NYC's density mass transit system contributing spread, well huge number cases coming Europe since NYC gateway Europe, state deal challenges.

Moreover, states 3-4 months advance notice 2 months study NY response instead they're yoloing exponential rise. Croatia requires 14-day quarantine everyone coming country. countries world open tourists right now: Mexico, Serbia, Turkey, USA. commend Croatia trying figure safely operate economy new normal. Yet, difficult given infectious nature virus. one glad charge things. Unlike Elon though Stark actually invents things. Actually it’s scientifically proven vinegar catches flies honey... Funny seemingly every single person highly intelligent successful seems spectrum, quite severely too. guess ones tendency take risks chance becoming successful also get known crazy shit because, well, impulsiveness / risk taking. Americans still want practice distancing go much less, all. loud violent minority Short term- Yes

Long term- No

You wait point. Good idea thank you! pack animals, evolved follow social whims tribe, whatever tribe we've subscribed to. see people going bars, restaurants, family gatherings, wearing masks, etc. behavior normalized ""we"" follow suit. leaders saying ""we hope people right thing,"" trying shift blame lack direction leadership onto individuals committing sin, people never would behaved poorly leader simply job correctly. get hybrid? get 45+ average mpg, often 50, petrol car trips generally 3-4 miles. half mile trips good still, average last 600 miles 45 mpg either hybrid good try drive economically. kinda considering bullshit governor spewing live Korea we've 280 deaths far. us wear masks.  Put foot tell no.

Now I'm one perfectly (except maybe South Korea). gonna give politicians benefit doubt also extend Trump  Something effectively communicated public health authorities idea need handful seconds exposure get infected. Definitely true, though fair Teslas think get broken less typical luxury people know sentry mode.

Feel like fear spread.  work GE, I'd say \~205,000 employees counts large corporation, deal bullshit either. workplace culture thing small 2 employee store way largest corporations. allows counties require businesses require patrons wear masks. penalties involved requires businesses enforce law. half asses measure best.

I dead set buying Tesla years. 

Now I’m close able afford one, aaand nope. financially supporting guy.

Time look elsewhere eco-friendly vehicle alternatives. Hang new sign new dates Darn face masks. It’s 100% definitely going get 200k well 10/1 Texas reopened May 1st uptick happened end June. 

Arizona reopened May 8th

Florida reopened May 4th

California reopened May 20 

North Carolina May 8


Surprisingly Georgia exploded AstraZeneca licensing different manufacturers around world (as part CEPI) ramp production ensure equitable distribution. Remember reading least 8 manufacturers others added list. One NYC sustainable rush resources hot spot.

5-6 NYCs going time huge risk enough national reserves surge. mention head state gotten tired already plans rush PPE ventilators national stockpile could normally situation normal. I’d worry larger average number people admitted, hospitals abled respond. I’d say information helps us plan accordingly. That's point.. point whomever makes car probably history terrible shit employees, environment, etc. hope unc houston stays safe masks up. hear things getting nutty houston. smell like ass Wtf.... first thing Oregon re-started. “Elective” doesn’t mean nose jobs, means anything schedule. understand medical procedures prohibited initially due fear strain hospitals, cancellation/postponement cause excess morbidity/mortality mitigation efforts. Yet hair salons bars restaurants go-ahead? 

There’s reason hospitals medical providers shouldn’t able function full capacity social distancing slowed spread, PPE manufactured massively hospitals ready excess capacity actionable plans expand necessary. naw, let’s half ass preparations go dinner first!  “it’s shame lost Bill, damn hair look great...” I'm florida hospital dad works nearing capacity well. Unnerving times news, water wet. job straight told us could take extended furlough, would call us decide separation would permanent end it.

Everyone took fired, take pay cut come back work purely claim voluntary employees come back in. ""Sorry got sick say could stay home look us help lifelong medical bills saddled cashflow interrupted - hero t-shirt us, though!"" think that's important take consideration saying ""all billionaires bad"" Some, most. lot people (read assholes) see massive reflection wish could like defend defend themselves. ""Pro-life"" fuck pedo Gee, done serious lockdown one month tops assistance businesses citizens deal would come side little worse wear. takes ridiculous. conservative media downplayed severity Yep, pausing reopening bars restaurants already open community spread already going full force going accomplish anything. Sadly predictable. See constitution evidence Trump federal government. VW stop making ID.3 cars run room store wait OS written. VW stated multiple times far ahead Tesla's EV tech compared industry whole. good EVs come saying right thing said Bolt. car supposed ""Tesla killer"" instead got destroyed sales vs Model 3. Wait cars launch judge them. Actually places shutdown tightly saved economies. Places wasted shutdown crying protective equipment much pain go unless miracle cure found. didnt start new one. Even 2, still human beings happened could another reason involved. According article, appeared news conference June talked factory. next day received “failure return” notices. That's person replied considers trend, early yesterday. another graph talk then, I'm going interpretations. editorializing make fit agenda. part original Swedish quote. company basically said, everyone go work home, allowed office without explicit permission. least return calls. two employees terminated likely Tesla dicks employees following whatever procedure established unreachable correct. don’t feel less “manly” wearing mask.  month it'll ""we plenty coffins"" Goodwill worse. Goodwill pretends charity giving jobs special needs people actually keep fucking place going abused horribly. boss physically intimidated getting face ran bins. Also coworker severe skitzophrenia totally verbally emotionally abused. next day murdered mother step-father Thanksgiving eve. ""Dustin Dixon Thanksgiving Murder Georgia"" google it. Goodwill seriously disturbing experience. TSLA wackest stock. 

Elon tweets something, either rises falls. Yes, example right problem role models today’s society. proffered one not. detrimental people opposed inspiring. Actions celebrated word “celebrity” completely denigrated. Wait wait wait..... long death using leverage? genuinely grieving time?

It could either. without sin cast first stone. I'm holding judgement that. fake news like people false negative testing positive again. study showed antibodies decrease overtime (duh that's body works), disregards bodies ability create antibodies demand.

But buying ""long term health affects"" less 6 months pandemic might irrationally scared Gavin Newsome really fucked people California. sure wearing properly, washing hands, never touched face wipe sweat. perfect protester. one person spread covid protests. impossible. I'm kind getting sick seeing news articles. literally copy paste. Bunch people meet up. bunch get Corona, queue shocks surprises. Next come emotional story badly Corona impacted EVERYONE else really take seriously. one thing starts respond situation, good thing. quite people act accordingly. fed much misinformation suspect take long time comply, ever comply.  Perfect. outdoors make sure people come wearing masks, go ahead it. Set hand sanitizer near food drinks people use freely. Encourage sit least feet apart tables. risk outdoors diminished (the virus live long surfaces directly exposed sun anyways), take sensible precautions risk low. *not* ADA discrimination, that's argument.  Yeah, understand that's instant loss job. wore mask... much else do. could right ""asshole"" spreading go get gas, groceries, etc. Yet r/squaredcircle quick defend like he’s old man something.

He wrong people’s eyes, weird reason. Keep wearing kneepads Chicoms. certain go far life. health experts could warned us would happen.... time specific damn it! really good music see saying. NOTHING SIZE DROPLETS (MOISTURE) GET MASK. OXYGEN levels. guy blowing smoke cause confusion. People like menace. believe. One tenth is, facebook. [How could guess got early either asymptomatic mild case. would explain he's cavalier everything. no. he's billionaire getting $0.26 raise year. 

I'd rather get raise, that's straight insulting. Sure, maybe?

We know circumstances terminations.

Maybe chaos restarting operations two employees became 'rounding error'.

It sucks absolutely empathise seems disngenuous article's author utilize circumstances personally attack Elon Musk half it. Well makes tool. hard stay fuck home? mean holy hell. Except planes Autopilot thinks fly without pilot supervision. does, mob mentalities. 

If people see YouTube post like it, become one see posts automatically, know unless look another account. living Idiocracy. Correct when?

I never quoted article also half price ...and masks weren’t already mandatory. Yeah fix instead bankrupting landlords also hurts economy puts people homes well. understand great institutions learning, hell, attended one best world. point citizens US generally becoming less scientifically literate. metric declining time compared industrialized nations. Trump never president philanthropy scam? prove lol seeing articles every country except USA Sorry, right. reported topic, closer review clears topic bar. Thanks letting know. honest, able simulate two versions reality mind compare see whats actually concrete pros cons, good bad generalizations,  

Essentially intelligence thing imo Considering written articles, books, talk interviewer nasty I'd say really open, public person.

He's stayed mostly silent. Cuz people buy emotion brain. Tesla status symbol political statemet article title implies laid employees chose stay home. Nope, two report.

And two one already told HR could come back.

If there's news, let's hear it, bullshit like one trust anything without scrutinizing it.  Coronavirus taught one thing, pretty much awesome power media community isolation. anything I'm starting understand anti-media sentiment that's largely come right wing last decade. isolation media (including social media) becomes primary source information. problem sensational one-dimensional, almost always ""newsworthy"" piece event absolute worst element it- although truthful, usually small minority. Often elevates platform negative element equal footing opposition enjoys broad support generates appearance controversy there's really little none.

* Mask use broadly supported
* Shutting states stay home orders broadly supported would continue receive support
* people made extreme sacrifices past three months
* people believe police reform appropriate use deadly force problem
* people believe strive make country equitable safe
* people believe statues, schools, monuments confederate soldiers inappropriate
* importantly, people complex, three dimensional opinions feelings things. One stance individual issue lump automatically worst element movement party. example, there's correlation people anti-vaccine people climate change deniers. often lumped one single group- often ""deplorable"" viewpoints.

Ordinarily, would know things intuitively, live diverse community interact different kinds people every day. changed since I've sheltering home.

I really start think damaging media within relatively closed, isolated communities. We've talked lot online space echo chamber- towns, there's physical echo-chamber too. know nothing guy assume money paid smart engineers build nice car idea sense didnt ask build nice bicycle. complete utter incompetence United States government responding SARS-CoV-2 going go history one lowest points country. lost immense amount respect prestige globally mention pumping federal reserve may end destroying dollar worlds reserve currency. clusterfuck immense proportions. Thanks also note, astroturf brand fake plastic grass. Fuck Medicare All. Skip UBI

(I would love least get Medicare All) largest local district doing. expect 25-50% families choose online instead coming back person. honestly need many stay home order even chance social distancing. Two heads pressed together. literally can't get physically closer that. Exclusively going schools kids billionaires (and people worth ""only"" eight nine figures.)

Until gets late high school/college classmates start thinking networking funding start-ups, one schools going give shit he's son billionaire, they. cover picture people wearing masks? clearly aren’t wearing masks it’s skyrocketed People like insufferable 

""How could people like something find enjoyable?!"" Yeah thats mean, thats number Im looking hehe Yeah saw Fight Club too, ya dick (Laughs Midwest). No, definitely anywhere near 80% locked State mandated it. JFC... [Can't find anything marriage, baby 40-50 cases per day last month, variation weekends holidays, trend?  Duh engineer

What fuck even supposed mean? guy engineer apartheid? monster!

Oh, no, regular engineer happened live South Africa. Maybe guy genuinely awful man (Elon seems think so); calling ""apartheid engineer"" bit much think? US desperately needs form federal response. Unfortunately guy charge realize late... Polestar 2 looks promising me. gan volvos, android fan. dream Nope. Nothing see here. Move on. Gotta catch Brazil’s record. Can’t let n1. Based af  Oh man! Billionaires good people! reason chance move great society! They’re wealth doesn’t affect psyche all! worked hard money! GO BILLIONAIRES!

/s obvious. poster trying spin particular way. That’s said, sheltering protested days. didn’t grill felt like crappy thing do. Finally leadership...these guys consider running office enact ideas! Yup, shortest seems 2 days.

Thankfully wore mask hopefully mitigated damage might done spreading it. California needs another lockdown. might already late avoid hospital overload. based IMHE model predicting 100,000 October before. makes lots assumptions that, apparently people politicians abide by. certainly allow things like Disney World NFL open stadiums. Emergencies key word. Changing meter emergency. busted water pipe gas leak risks properties building emergency. faulty water meter going put anyone risk. wait. Well least Tx Gov woken suspended reopening 🙄 prefer kind tie (mine use shoelaces) behind head face shaped. elastic irritates ears. also make ones tie behind ears also ones pull clip things tighten it.  non-american, surprising - even bad? suggests policy blanket one, sort afterwards. assume relatives can't legally cash them? dunno, I'm bashing way things handled, seems natural result comprehensive approach? keep hearing story different places; Cali, Texas, Florida, etc. one remember clearly Pinal County Arizona sheriff refused enforce mask mandate got Covid campaigning re-election *Despite diagnosis, Pinal County sheriff says still plans wear mask public enforce future orders requiring one so.*  "" 🤦‍♂️

p.s. saw NC sheriff say thing  agree, today said tandverd subtitles supposed tandvård. Still source though. Official too. agree. like changing nervous system. mean try. You’re absolutely correct.

My response state leverage pay medical professionals salary attract hospitals. Private companies constrained don’t option raising taxes pick slack.

(This also means US’s attitude towards taxes would need change, know that’s tough sell. it’s would need order prepared pandemics.) How’s that? Bc according study mask pointless Luckily, I've moved away industry employed organized different field entirely. I'm part much, much larger organization (I.A.T.S.E.), one enough members negotiate effectively.

Thank though, need people know negotiate rights. say “NO”... u must proceed party, safest way everyone 20 ppl show test result conducted within past 5 days showing “negative” lie low attack. used maybe 1 2 right wing links because, time, ones hosting video 55 year old disabled woman inappropriately triaged left suffocate death. daughter wanted video distributed others would suffer way mother did, fringe sites hosted teh video. 

Otherwise links 99.99999999999% msm. mean there's certain 25% would distraught brought themselves. Unfortunately dont get congratulate safe zone- accountable failure. Like Trump unfortunately man charge country's response, share responsibility inaction. Reminds like cop said “hit me, get chest! give permission, snuck see happens...” bam! Assaulted back Arrested him. 

The guy known, also cop say permission... kinda trap ya ask me... Well played. thought well! Especially since last years harder flu seasons. flu tapered year Spring due lockdown.

But guess, wait see. big unknown schools! doing? school survey parents get idea mask wearing kids. hope cohorting. kids mask one class. kids without mask another one. thing is, even though we've using masks, people used correctly. Went yesterday many people masks chin, dangling ears, covering mouth nose. r/leopardsatemyface call. long distance would probably fine, large gathering still risk. Baltic nation flattening curve. feel ya, thank you. IBM something similar  It’s hard even make millions without taking advantage least people. That’s game lot people okay it. get great things terms R&amp;D damage consequences pretty sucky. think people wanting return McDonald's employees need paycheque. happens social safety net economy shuts down. 

The lack social safety net US means many people able afford basics done. Whether food, rent healthcare. 

Countries greater compliance also better government responses. Take Canada, government continues provide public healthcare, $2000.00 CAD month people whose income fell $1000.00 government provided wage subsidy employers, federal rental assistance small businesses. $50,000 loan small businesses, $10,000 forgiveable. Bank Canada bought provincial bonds allow provinces spend without worrying bankruptcy. 

By contrast US expanded UI, expand qualified. many business owners, contract employees gig employees got nothing. one time payment $1500.00 USD given everyone delayed print president's name. support given small businesses though paycheque protection program abused large businesses. Plus lack universal healthcare means many furloughed people lost healthcare, get covid can't afford treatment. Finally States getting support likelihood many States go bankrupt laying public sector employees little social safety net US provides also state level also collapses. 

So eventually everything breaks down. Even Fed Chairman begging Congress act fix economic conditions. Otherwise good luck getting compliance American public. Funny place work thing. Yeah it’s dumbest thing ever. They’re inside laundry/utility closet, connected pipes go hot water tank meter hot water only. claim mine 60 others don’t read properly they’re batch replacement. another fun fact: board approved without vote get pay ourselves! Getting hit assessment next month still undisclosed. far positive COVID cases linked protests fraction attending, stand said. hours later. Dude Elon's marketing good managed make Tesla worth Toyota fucking reason lol. gonna act like Toyota best electric car manufacturers business? fine speak truth. That's I'm encouraging do. agree protests may resulting cases Covid. important cause is, makes nervous.

But cases across country, people involved peaceful demonstrations ones looting. week so, looting tailed off, protests still going strong. demean cause calling riots. disingenuous best. absurd. Cases Bangladesh might get doubled 240,000 July. yet see quote Swedish official claiming Sweden herd immunity strategy.

I would really happy/unhappy could provide one.

And 6% seroprevalence insistance Swedes keep following restrictions rimes badly herd immunity strategy. Oh, interesting, found[ Employees working home continue so, production workers required come work starting Friday, according internal email human resources executive Valerie Workman obtained wrote employees worried exposing live virus could remain home end month without pay would need sign document confirming live person vulnerable virus.

But I'm probably beating dead horse point lol see Trump tweeting cases going due testing deaths going down: simple question, isn’t people don’t immediately die virus, course would expect commensurate spike deaths come weeks spike cases. 

Seems obvious, good argument deaths going stay down? want know best argument someone else make support Trump this, clear whether even hint legitimacy. thing think say testing capacity horrendously bad before, throw data completely pay mind compares data we’re getting now. 20%, that's extra demand clear back log things get done lock down. clear back log, even further. sound good all. think are. Home Depot well. common among large retailers Elon Musk pedophile. Anybody get haircut since things reopened? I'm thinking going couple weeks since cases high area, barber one person time, long he's wearing mask face shield think risk bad. hair annoying thought would be, I'm gonna see anybody I'm trying impress anytime soon, sure worth it. Yeah, even that's true, matter time spreads boomers big time. Yep however openings suspended. Let’s face Gov said everyone back quarintine would never fly people would plain refuse problem job, I'm sure illegal not, they'd always like ""come like hour"" make stay xyz clock till next hour started. basically get hour free, stupid, ever become common old gm left, gm hired long known (to good approximation) outdoor anything safer indoor anything.

The protests outside. safe, *much* safer than, example, indoor rally. missing point. Tesla never said jobs would forfeit come back. Even giving choice alludes fact wouldn't. company choice straight employee instead decided offer hope hopeless situation. I've seen countless local companies regardless company size really scummy way let someone go.

I also know would focus communication aspect case. literally weakest point case obviously used try fire people call, show Tesla need pay unemployment benefits. entirely scummy part this. hope Yeah. hear that. would walked Yogurtland child. Tesla save exponentially lives covid take whole.

Know else end covid? uninhabitable planet.

Your hurt feelings insignificant comparing mission Tesla. mean exactly every scientist said would follow hopes politicians? Wow shocking. Brilliant evil strategy. Force demographic back work public facing jobs protection, blame getting sick.

Edit: added evil. fucking picture says enough. nasty industry! Attempts reopen because, economy, jobs. happens people don’t care. Oh well, let’s postpone reopening, because, coronavirus. goes jobs economy. Pffft. social media feeds full photos people traveling partying across state together

Accurate Ohio, too. I'm sick seeing people bad selfies captions like ""finally!!"" ""so glad eating restaurants acceptable again!!"" ""what weird time, glad now!!""

You idiots, over. no, eating restaurant ""acceptable"" again, 0 self-control can't judge dining indoors public place surrounded strangers bad idea whether legal not. that's crux issue, that's article corresponding headline about. not. certainly hope that’s true, scares virus. comparison's sake, flu kills 10,000 100,000 people year US, depending upon good vaccine year. hit 100,000 deaths 3 months first death US. yeah, like bad flu. *really, really, really* bad flu vaccine for. genuinely want know full shit not. I'm advocating use mask. Corona virus hoax, would Gov this?

/s understand people US seems can't learn countries even US states. determined make mistaken themselves. 

""Those learn history doomed repeat it"" - kidding! he? extra special celebration holidays birthdays didn’t get over.

Imagine huge would be! amuzing separation power US separate. individualism becoming double edge sword. people use Tons people know wear mask wrong reason. think protects themselves, dont know really protect others. dont even tell them, id rather wearing one wrong reason all. Robert Evans king Elon Musk piece shit. cult members need find new hero. ""may"" ...no certainly have. expect would happen tell people deadly virus hoax? BS.He studied AIDS.AIDS way devastating long term. One news outlet downplayed Covid-19 Fox News. claiming leftist spamming? downplayed it, spread alternative facts see results. Good you! feel sorry work around people without masks don’t care anyone’s health. grocery delivery pay huge tips let delivery person know much appreciate valuable service. mom lives NC isn’t seeing backlash masks. Something’s wrong state. walmart haircuts versus elective surgeries hard choice make. Yeah, buying cars them. Yeah, usually get around using what's called bonuses. Unfortunately criteria qualify quarterly bonus strict rigged lower end workers get $50 - $200 every months, higher ups get well $3k bonuses, quarter.  don’t really care think feel shame stance. 

The countries implanted mandatory masks better statistics haven’t. Fuck off. exemption specifically “people color worried racial profiling harassment due wearing face coverings public.”

This give agency POC didn’t feel safe wearing mask due fear getting shot police cops called shopping. outside everyone wearing masks, protests proven 100 percent stops spread. fine /s Either lunch lady... touching food nasty stuff it..  protect well, less efficient protecting others. unhealthy workplace culture big Google, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon instead Scary thing people assuming immune get since beginning this. still unsure antibodies immunity recovering. feeling China Russia wanted whole time. Wayne Enterprises Whenever people say terrible 2020 is, seem forget average quality life 2020 still much, much higher 1920,1820 1720. You’re spot we’ve heard Elon treats employees, disagree companies “just marketing”.

Tesla’s vehicles regarded incredibly highly relative modern vehicles (most produced companies manufacturing cars 50+ years) top they’re entirely electric self-driving capabilities - vehicles changed perception expect cars. hardware software Tesla products much “just marketing” - it’s like vaporware.

Look SpaceX well. sent two astronauts ISS American soil first time almost decade. they’ve got plans much more.

Don’t know much SolarCity’s products relative industry, they’re vaporware.

To last point, seems lots people it’s Elon’s companies futurology. Many people work passionate engineering innovation - that’s accept horrible working conditions: sacrifice able work high-quality company working stuff they’re passionate about. use masks. 

They isolate quarantine.

You go bad self. find amusing trying claim country insane levels smoking healthier lung/heart virus. claim Asia built shoulders Adonis-like people, guess asking logic difficult. Oh yeah? hypothetical cars coming future already better ones already road constantly learning updating software half million cars providing real world data? Seems like something maybe *want* true solved little bit ethical, transparent organizational outreach money. Sounds like doesn’t know handle something off-script. “Yeah sorry I’m happy working doctor delivering babies.” “But don’t want something important life?!” Cuomo literally competent Governor there's even worse emergency society going survive?

That’s like immunodeficiency. still home locked much possible Nothing changed since February.  Think many millions he'd raise ~~himself~~ campaign too? guess stable genius could see potential though. Widely available testing still make lot easier live work NYC. 

But yeah, get OP initial quarantine period. still receive part mine. is...omfg. 500 beds several hundred pr day, sounds like 2.5 days me? insane. Don’t people parents grandparents? „Well know mom might like die everything really _need_ cosmo right now“. Luckily we've got top opthalmologists case oxy? Basically Southern states millions people joked COVID-19 NYC problem gonna get clapped.

We live father law. He’s 75, smokes, overweight.

She, last minute, tried join us family Lakehouse two weeks ago. told no, would let husband weekend 24 hours notice. Cue BLOW UP. “This bullshit, don’t it, I’m sick, know REALLY about, etc”.

Last weekend Father’s Day, old man calls asks politely stay 6 feet away since she’s teaching studio. BLOW UP. They’re coming. we’re “treated” like this, won’t there!

Get ready! Stand ground company also shit. Worse, intimidating people wear masks office times, social distance (despite covid19 protocols enforced office). intimidating people reprimanding ""be nice"" one person got called supervisors office told complaints saying hi people halls, told go home without pay day could nice. person one wearing mask area (probably whole floor, that's know). fucking brutal.

Honestly, feel like better route could've gone. Unfortunately labor US “at will” employer fire reason

""Fire reason"" different ""Fire something long illegal discrimination, expressly prohibited law.""

In specific instance we're discussing employees appear terminated inappropriately company taken unpaid leave -- leave might even protected current FLMA changes, enough detail given Washington Post story determine that. Further, company citing demonstrably false basis termination. 

Elon Musk apparently decided none people work rights, repeatedly admonished complaints made Fair Labor Standards Act. information provided here, company absolutely wrong. 

Then enter Musk fanboys like one responded apparently believe employees right discuss poor working conditions public media, absolutely do, complaining employer things violate state, federal, local statutes rules regarding work place safety -- guess what, illegal employer fire you.

It might difficult demonstrate that, Tesla fired multiple employees attempting exercise rights work place, including attempting organize union, apparently complaining unsafe working conditions. 

What Tesla done probably illegal -- personally ordered Musk directly, absolutely established organizational culture prides illegal dishonest conduct complete disregard rights others kind panache capable rich white South African guy.

Rulers dont follow rules assholes. White House? Gotcha. case suspending elective surgeries wise needs happen, also bad sign. British time term became ""off limits""

This article published backlash. analysis bunk.

First off, actually take Britain quotes context, becomes apparent they're talking unnecessarily hard lockdown, like Norwegian one. see anything strategy mentioned anywhere quotes. goes hand-in-hand said mean that's strategy, they're working towards current immumity whole world needs go - called ""vaccination"", believe.

So, wanna try find *single* quote herd immumity would strategy? Come Ron, follow suite. complete nonsense. Ten years ago doctors directors told masks don’t work? would hospitals continue spending millions dollars masks then? think hospital director would spend penny ineffective gear? Every study internet actually points not-so-limited effectiveness masks ‘situation’ late ""The workers provided evidence continuing correspondence managers. believe received notifications speaking their concerns with working conditions plant.""

And later article, mentions communication HR indicating could stay home

Since received notices last week, Gabriel Naro said received calls HR representatives. Naro told could come back, though prompted offer date return

A day June 15 news conference, however, Gabriel Naro received emails company’s human resources department titled “Failure Return Work.” company’s HR department informed would let go. also could dispute matter brought back — implication would return work.

Invariably, would need 'cede' others demonstrate people around knowledge, competency, ability (and never could) have. Which, authoritarian, threat legitimacy. 

Even one week vaguely 'took seriously' pressers deferring Fauci others, would contradict otherwise push messaging back soon got back mic soon became popular, visibility diminished, pressers stopped etc.

IGNORED warnings experts willfully ignorant yet confident af.

All perfect Dunning Kruger examples. perched proudly top ""Mount Stupid"" 

And fuck them. reason US behaving ""behave"" longer fuckwits prolonging process.

Fuck again. Eh good history responding rationally covid.  They've defied local ordinances (first time lost, second time governor got involved made agreement allow open early), threatened move Texas, multiple times Elon publicly claimed covid big deal.  least believable thing story Tesla saying people get back work feel comfortable. 6 according dashboard.... doesn’t seem correct. Tesla 48k employees. think two ones took company “if you’re uncomfortable coming don’t come in”? 

It’s safe say thousand employees same. didn’t get fired. two something get fired acceptions course people could easily taken good ol flu fuck. Figures, family usually first ones screw over.  Except not, covid relief fund, ask prove record previous employment. need social security number, questions asked. Irresponsible. U.S. ban travel Europe.


/s listened behind bastards podcast episode Elon well, he's worst I've already seen couple examples hospitals requiring operating capital. I'm also pretty sure Hospitals already received bailouts.

For whatever reason hand waved repeatedly people criticizing jealous nonsense. found multiple sources saying Tesla lost $862M '19 alone ($1B '18.) profits see quarterly, assume losing quarters cancel profitable ones. sources? still people acting like nothing us could done better. meaningful graph without also including number tests administered?

Well dad married step sister. apple fall far.  New contracts equal less hourly pay, vacation time, personal time previous contract(s).

Unions can't reshape economic universe. apply leverage have. complain worse contracts, without union contract all. pay would suffer commensurately. union defending gains made long ago, would wiped entirely, day, union gone. thought Elon dedicated working front lines plant. happened? Yeah, keep pointing people lot countries gotten virus less hundred new cases day, cases stopped completely. argue, 'well would never work USA many people much larger.' make sense, let get bad first place could definitely control now. Hulk hogan comes back vs Chinese giant

The American corona killer vs Stereotypical Chinese man would record breaking pay per views .

Donald trump guest referee Sounds like another big company starts letter W. lol nah, comment building suggestion to, ""Call county health already passed away surprise they'd prefer that. Essentially things required properly handle pandemic would require enacting things one side saying destroy country decades. top people get used things see sustainable better current system they'll want stay.

The silk cut significantly expensive sheet, bought discounter ralph lauren. going make dress. Ah well, lucky lying around :), whole family luxury fabric masks. symptom way country going divided years IMO.

Seriously. Trump would wear mask tell people wear mask would see almost everywhere. Yeah could already infected/killed vulnerable, mainly infecting younger people likely survive? could deadly. Yup. antibodies last, disease ultimate long game killer.

It degrade body many ways, many would place higher risk group subsequent infections. Fear.

The people refusing wear masks accuse wear masks afraid. nothing says shit-your-pants afraid quite like trying pretend deadly virus exist. lash masks visual reminder reality. They'd rather live la-la land deadly virus. Someone wondering Danes fail much nordic countries implemented tactic much topic. 

It takes 40 swedes live lives 41 danes time years. population Sweden lives extra life 255,000 danes. That´s alot lives lost swedes live danes huge difference neighbouring countries, don´t agree?

Great news turns valid. fucking hate Vegas fact entire city smells like disgusting overflowing ashtray big part why. smell always given pounding headache since small child. love going bellagio, seeing neat fountains architecture, step inside smells like sedentary octogenarian smoker’s tv recliner afraid protests effective might see bump crime.

That's precisely happened. likely happen again, number people experiencing economic pain shitstorm brings increases. ...18 relatives tested positive....holy shit. don’t know, big doubts ever see real life Yeah, think exactly way too. believe minority. 

I went elderly mother-in-law’s house pick piece equipment yard. We’d normally hug goodbye, told can’t hug *because* love her. genuinely confused. rest family hasn’t socially distanced hasn’t socially distanced herself. no, isn’t demented something. think thinks family worth risk. 

I don’t want accidentally killing wife’s mom conscience. Call looney... Perhaps, government going drastically increase protections without anyone asking. Strong unions large strikes good clubs lobbying bag. maybe black light posters make comeback... already trying to, lets real, current racial environment really want cops walking minority neighborhoods fining people wearing masks? much class problem political one point. educated understand risks, many not... assumed Tesla Space X profitable, PayPal? significant number supporters people don’t want anybody tell do. Especially benefit something mostly someone else, them. don’t want told buy fuel efficient vehicles. don’t want told vaccinate kids. don’t want told say racist stuff. don’t want told wear mask. can’t appeal group people saying stay home wear mask even really don’t want to. someone reaching end recommended child-bearing age (it would ""geriatric""pregnancy) wants another baby, whole situation frustrating me. 

I want another child want become pregnant, deliver pandemic.

What’s nuts dedicated amount folks come either purposefully spread misinformation troll folks really worried virus. Also seems like folks come rail lockdown get reaction folks. 

Like, probably wrong sub take anti mask conspiracy too, yet folks still post shit. 

It’s also nuts amount misinformation spread. Sorting controversial wild ride. People don’t think post. Gaaaawwwly, feel attacked! idiot zombie movies tried warn us about, trusting believe people stupid.  family members still organic bodies infected viruses, not? something magically tell virus ""this family member, infect"" lol He's got little Trump streak I'm afraid.  Real talk though, masks still somewhat hard come kind suck Thank additional information. Wow, quite infection rate. Maybe helpful instead shit? bunch union parties coalesce vanguard party? reminds funny (true) story. 

My grandaunt, age 93, passed driver’s test (over certain age take driving test recertify) promptly purchased new car. logic “well, it’s likely I’ll die pay off!”, didn’t, take another driving test age 97...which didn’t pass. 

She actually lived 104, stayed sharp tack end, couldn’t see shit. Fuck virus. That's say. everybody surprised society willing put price everything, health care, education, public safety, public infrastructure also willing put price human life order keep profit machine running? person brought virus gathering symptomatic, photo shows social distancing. really frustrating hear try claim followed rules, muddies waters safe. must hard public health officials judge precautions effective people dishonest ignorant following guidelines. honoring Tesla anyways Idk bud tend find life enjoyable I'm alive apposed existing all, even things shit right now, yes still wish bring child world. hard rn?

15th: bad news you.

He's ousted Chairman Board Tesla. replaced someone even worse: Rupert Murdoch's son, Lachlan. always wear two masks. ridicule mask REMOVE said mask reveal second mask underneath original one Ah, always shame leopards eat face whose faces presented them. Nah. Tesla meme stock doesn’t really make sense. It’s pretty much propped hype fanboys. loop whole country this. many states handling according best science available, states handling based completely made bullshit set rules. states surging right exception California one common denominator. I'm glad interviewed two people refused attend. see articles focused people went got Covid, annoying ""surprised"" got sick. least two showing people invited something dumb like party. People protesting wearing mask. No, go test drive one. They’re amazing ruin cars you.

Unless care luxury, buy Lexus something. GOES FREE. He's even traditional tech entrepreneur equally scummy. He's grifter family modern slave owners. incumbent one point sub-40 approval rating Election year.

And incumbent support two hostile foreign governments. Make sure registered vote, actually vote. Sure, could definitely make argument, point end day, aligned anyway, it’s like acquired company nothing core business prop up. remember correctly got vote shareholders order let happen not. People dumb want hate sake hating. want electric I'm going buy Tesla...ever accuse someone it, guy criticizing musk musk seemingly got defensive called name 'pedo guy'. used way people use cunt asshole. guy sued lost. Hey right you. Health insurance tied employer stopped going start creating business. Healthcare would also benefit society whole, except healthcare insurance industry would see jobs going away. issue idea address help. Good question. wondering thing. Bit late chief flattened curve lockdown extreme social distancing. Come on, Arizona. Texas it.... *a weeks* *a months*, huh? country public system built provide care pandemic? Also, cost keeping large ICU small percentage beds taken pandemic astronomical. sub awhile, one understand supply money, goods, services finite? yet living post-scarcity world. hospital front line workers get wearing head toe protection, get wearing cloth mask protesting thousands people tightly packed together shouting. mean can’t expect business owner want open ability to. Especially they’re getting free money govt pay payroll. much don’t agree open can’t blame owner wanting make money. alright every major corporations doing? Tesla company this. majority are. living conditions poorest. important measure country's economy. let anyone house, HOA not. HOA control appearance house yard. control access home. want replace meters inside home, wait pandemic. meter currently work fine till then.

Tell virus risk health outweighs desire change meters time allowing home time. lol. 100x lower translate concerning actual body count? many less total people died countries strictly wore mask population? Ok... Tbh job tried tell come back right I'd tell fuck off. already apply unemployment I've making work (I working last year states unemployment goes based amount made year prior) definitely feel pinch SO's income. heart hurts can't that. reasonable, see start spike two weeks so. Fourteen days upper end incubation time.

Not necessarily, first group people get infected small enough may show statistics. may reflected cycles exponential growth since we're still little testing. First comes tests, comes disparage... Last comes people death day carriage I’m sending good vibes dude. Hopefully get storm alright. think wave is? ask? 2 decided stay home? 

Or 2 people terminated they’re trying make Covid related?


Honestly asking, shit article bad job breaking actually happened.  US, would labeled traitors.  Yeah, March. Pope Francis even seen coughing sniffling Sunday Mass, COVID 19 rumors started. tests ended coming negative. either it, covered up, morale damaged, common cold. reason needs law. Even can't enforce immediately, *will* change minds people gradually others start see majority it. would thought guy born outrageous wealth family eccentric weirdos famously anti-union sentiment would treat workers disposable? trend rising well. bet could chart correlation. sheriff WA got megaphone told people sheep. Since police allowed inject politics? get court martial shit military. *we’re going streaking!!!* Wrong again. even read report? general index. subtitle theme year. Btw, 7 top 10 countries freedom-hating European/UK countries.

Your bullshit theory ""freedom"" U.S. evidenced ""innovation"" makes impossible handle outbreak well Europe. First, I'm sure seem think fact California bigger Switzerland somehow means rate innovation ""freedom"" innovate MUST higher California. That's plainly illogical; asserting remotely prove point. Rate quantity literally thing.

Then, listed states handling things well, relatively speaking, top. According argument, states innovative ""free"" handling things worst. disproven argument. Really idiotic point tried make federal government state governments treating opposite making seem like it’s serious. like everyone else lol, keep downvoting makes sleep better say Walmart? anyone truly believes Elon isn’t entitled prick, delusional. good marketer/business guy sure - clearly massive prick.  Fire bastards millionaire like *rich* rich. like upper end upper middle class. around thump

... twiddling thumbs? uh European hospitals? must even truer story pandemic: badly prepared scarily underfunded European countries mass disaster. I've done it.

And act like that. think read somewhere actually corrected actual person responsible kind things Tesla, actual holiday area, people think virus fake overblown ones wearing them. Waffle House, Chikfila, Mellow Mushroom, California Pizza Kitchen... American-restaurant chain - fast food, fast-casual, full service, otherwise. quibbling semantics;

No quibbling intentionally mistranslating Swedish English make support claim. Can't wait Trump tweet ""LIBERATE TEXAS!"" Macy's Unfortunately labor US “at will” employer fire reason. long say fired unsatisfactory performance don’t say fired illegal reason it’s almost impossible prove wrongful termination. Considering much time spend commenting Reddit posts, I'm going assume either unemployed graduated college/high school yet Yum! Brands will. (Pizza Hut/KFC/Taco Bell) can’t tell really thinks good idea kind petty retaliation big cities screaming danger. Waffle House, Chikfila, Mellow Mushroom, California Pizza Kitchen... American-restaurant chain - fast food, fast-casual, full service, otherwise. that's case Covid 19 exist everything told lie. ~~protest~~ riot spike. Wamazon Doubt it. everyone stayed home social distancing, shops especially bars/restaurants suffered really badly. Lots people lost jobs etc Ohio, too. Cases increasing weeks county, first time setting free testing sites require doctor's order. noticed recently, starting become new prius drivers. Hogs left lane drives 5 mph speed limit. see everyday. would be... I'm gonna defend Elon that. gonna sink level? fuck missing here?

That deflecting main point attacking guy making grammar mistake. Education grammar fuck make America smarter. However pointing circle jerking argument. Tbf MCU hero (arguably) considered completely good Captain America. rest either shady stuff past (or even present) even meant heroes first place. Florida's got map color code counties based many ICU rooms left, looks pretty ugly day. Unless get paid $7-10 hour US Fuck Elon Musk. Crap. Chinese totally don’t agree initiate war nuclear attack. guys persecutory delusion. living alternate universe Cuomo didn’t completely botch NY’s response? What's citation 25% number? indoor outdoor indoor? kinda proving point unsubstantiated circle jerk ""evil anti mask heretics"" (of Saint Dr. Fauci would included 4 months ago btw). wear mask pro mask strawman window down. dude won’t roll down. texted morning co worker diagnosed. “safety” meeting announce it, continuing enforce mask wearing. can’t even make crap point. NOOOOOOOOOO. Wtf Tesla. Elon ya doin man?!?! They're shaken? really stupid?  
I guess. way 2,000. [See results 40 California cases submitted CDC confirm COVID infection early December 2019 could support theory virus circulating widely among population long time first confirmed arrived U.S. Remember, January March, testing people recently traveled Wuhan China. testing people presenting flu-like symptoms, generally, like now. THANK YOU.

in middle deep-cleaning house needed something new interesting listen to, one sounds good  obviously never union. Layoffs start lowest seniority. Hertz Car Sales one them, actively discourage “union”-talk continued emails fliers place. everyone job sitting, sitting. highly populated areas majority think masks helpful...the fact people willing make death threats doesn’t mean much actually look numbers overall. growth slightly smaller population spread densed city country. days per doubling. still grow exponentially. I'm South Florida hospital dad works (he oncology) constantly increasing covid #s months. Really frustrating. nothing? dunno. feel little exhaust ports dont help others. wear basic blue surgical Check Target Workers United group, they're facebook. They've done great work standing workers rights! I'm Denmark North Europe :) 

Mountains Guatelama sounds cooler though. show this, let argue today’s front page. Tell far scroll see mention COVID. Also keep notes mention COVID cases rapidly climbing everywhere US. 70 automatically makes high risk. agree...but like...that sample size bit lacking. oh, course. Well Joe Rogan idiot anyway, mass appeal meat heads think hes ""woke"" really things. course, help lots smart employees. one defined mission, brought together, led accomplishments, losing almost entire fortune order get there.

I'm aware found Tesla, know details replaced original founders. Maybe nice person, matter. point is, led Tesla early on, become success today.

Listen you, calling 'Kool-Aid drinker' respect Elon's accomplishments. hivemind force today.

My point this: Elon may asshole egomanic (probably given tweets stories him), fine point out. ridiculous completely dismiss everything accomplished he's nice person. Yes, might ass, he's incredibly accomplished one, really amazing things future humanity. both. imagine benefit slightly longer wavelengths would deeper penetration ability disinfect viruses hiding protective droplets surfaces. Even perfect immediate disinfection shallow depth may optimal real world.  got antibodies test done days ago. results yet doctor said antibodies mean anything. said mean protected test tells us it. That’s bit hyperbolic. Several governors instituted research-based policies controlled spread virus states. Unfortunately governors whose obstinance partisan pandering real-world consequences residents states contributing mixed messaging, data suppression, rising infection rates areas. hope policies successful various states countries (such mandated mask wearing) become widely adopted next several months. Anyone ever doubted voting consequences hopefully learned much competence matters leader. Also, stuff usually good quality cheap. local Aldi, worth check out.  Also side point/question, anyone ever seen self checkout lanes actually cleaned? That's everyone paid attention results antibody testing thinking. ...Or die massive coronavirus surge read part. believe missing point.

My point whether two people terminated victims wrongful termination. one comment thread enough information make determination.

My point nothing article indicates significant event.

There probably 10,000 people country terminated recently feel done unjustly. going write news article one them?



**""Local Burger Jockey Gets Flip. Callous Manager Care.""**

*Washington Post, Financial Section*

When Eric Doe told call find report shift Wendy's Wednesday morning, thought everything fine.

""I thought everything fine,"" told interviewer.

Eric reportedly repeatedly called Wendy's, located Carswell Boulevard Tottenham county, FL. says received busy signal every time.

Eric's manager, Carlos Martin, denied ever hearing phone ring.

""I never heard phone ring, day"" said.

""We busy evening hoping Eric would call could tell report work. never did. 5th similar offense last couple months, let go.""

This kind behavior we'd expect Wendy's. Eric Doe reported half employees even wear hairnets sometimes management mean them.

""Sometimes, tell customers chili, even aren't.""

...

Boom. 20k upvotes everyone talking much asshole Dave Thomas is. ...dishonest compromised. 

Fixed you. never heard before, loved delivery Part 1of Elon Musk episode, I'll definitely check Universities world trouble right now. refund half semesters room board students. graduate programs losing tuition money students stuck abroad. taking MASSIVE cuts revenue without real way cut costs seeing journals this, went looking products install facilities....

The 222nm emitters available, yet, commercial products. (At least, spent time looking last weeks, found.) said, several components seem offered, could integrated new products quickly, manufacturer supply-chain starting ramp up... consumer products, yet.

As always lighting technology, expect see fakes real thing shelves. eventually buy stuff, try qualify vendor carefully, test actual product.  medical applications, take months (at least) FDA process. LOL NYT.  Good luck Texas. Hopefully states actually learn time, unlike New York New Jersey. Sad time American. think Florida could hit 10k/day avg pretty soon? half GA's population Atlanta metro. Atlanta start re-opening end May. also purely coincidence GA's numbers started reverse downward trend two weeks 'state' re-opened started spiking another two weeks Atlanta started re-opening. Purely coincidence. Jet blue southwest, etc? limited number airlines flying Myrtle Beach? I'm familiar area. Even 1% die, that's still lot people. nothingburger people take seriously deadly Smallpox Ebola. F website. hope one gives clicks... please. What's tragic medical staff infected. collect unemployment generous weekly bonus. Buying Tesla save world. protect cannot protect touch hot iron too, despite knowing it’s hot. masks then? mom insists come home wash hands wear mask around grandparents. says I'm silly. feel like internet tells otherwise. Thanks thoughtful informative reply. stated differently, right. expert topic, read book: *Deadliest Enemy: War Killer Germs* dr. Osterholm, that's got information. implying operating efficiently.

Osterholm strongly believe must major overhaul WHO, beginning governance financial support member nations, effective public health response twenty-first-century world infectious diseases. cannot accomplished, need start come new international organization agency job. hallmark agency would ability strategically tactically address Crisis Agenda (described book) we've laid out. US government must look carefully reprioritizing reorganizing public health programs make meaningful change prevent control infectious diseases.

Again, obviously know much topic do. Thanks clarifying. imagine 10% population (33 million USA) 83 IQ unfit even military service. increasing abstract computer focused world? “Weed isn’t addictive, spend income weed calms me.” Hold on, government supposed represent us.

It all. anyone see that? GOP leaders congressmen women way act interests people United States.  

They act make money, help businesses friends make money, hold power.  

It never obvious past 4 years GOP government absolutely corrupt working American people.  

However, watch Fox news listen conservative talk shows, probably can't see corrupt awful GOP leaders are. [Georgia surging though]  got call today start back July 6. furloughed March... [Here's video quite ""let's make prison"", recall, much limit egress points apartment complex everyone go single checkpoint make sure they're quarantining reason go building.

There also apartments doors bolted outside, mainly people keep quarantine. government would send social worker places daily food supplies wellness check. Yeah (54 COPD) dad wants compromised immune) mom come house first time July 4. Also, family members. 

Which weird, he's absolutely paranoid getting COVID till now. think he's tired social distancing and/or wants get get with. He's always type try get killed something stupid (though that's usually motor vehicle related)

We're state seen much reduced infections hospitalizations, though. still think bad idea. hoarding, mean circulating wealth back economy paying employees fair wages make company successful. Instead, hold onto wealth form holding companies, tax havens, offshore loopholes, investing.  

Why? get away it... They're ones influencing legislation. Speak words. Same, enjoyed 3 week vacation beginning april. got tested covid19 turns regular viral pneumonia . waited 14 days test result, job gave another week pneumonia. I'm still 100 percent healthy I'm grateful covid. sex? that? chalk losses 'collateral'. knew people high school worked McDonald’s, would go work shift, work hour manager would decide didn’t need many people send home. paying gas actually lost money working. well look way people outside window infecting everyone outside window....and eventually everyone walking might assumed infected.....thats would see Well can’t catch concussion one thing. can’t end slow pandemic people trying many people going normal lives. travel interaction (and subsequent interactions campus mingling students professors staff) perfect way perpetuate expand outbreak that’s last thing want right warning flag months ago.. currently living Texas need stay home. go work, go shopping, meet anyone, wear mask go shopping. think I'm selfish


Well got right sadly key nyc running ventilators expected cases then? rugby game refernced almost 3 weeks ago.Right evidence (or lack of) confident statement cases outside quarantine NZ cases community transmission. easy make claim without proof evidence say ""unknowns"" that's evidence. guilty downplaying coronavirus sounds like classic brain vs penis fight.  ""human"" problem American problem?

There's really great book called [Fantasyland: America Went \- really suggests way thinking uniquely American, basically foundation built country. Please actually vote someone besides Trump. know might first choice, cannot Trump another 4 years. Look man done 4 short years. country shambles. know nothing directly, way handled every disaster fucked. SARS-COV-1 officially contained July 15th, 2003 I’m WV high key annoyed people traveling. really weren’t hit hard coronavirus - hoping keep way lol it’s good one. I’m little embarrassed wear one, especially I’m going date. infections two weeks ago. 

Once cancel fall sports, schools call far in-person instruction classes go online. know colleges universities across country kind plan re-opening, believe big schools decision really came athletic programs bringing student-athletes campus. season canceled, student-athletes reason come campus smart move would redshirt year (if can) petition year count toward eligibility moving forward. get away losing year eligibility, attend classes?

The problem canceling season, closing schools, really impact smaller, lower division schools, who, without government aid, likely shutter entirely. there's guarantee herd immunity novel virus faaaair Fudging numbers reported/confirmed cases completely different thing asymptomatic cases confirmed/reported. average person encouraged vote. do. own. peds nurses running adult ventilators like NYC mean, CA less COVID deaths Michigan pretty surprising considering California almost 4x people. Exactly this. stop celebrating super centenarians survive this? It’s really giving virus-deniers ammunition ridiculous crusade science. 

Surviving immune response whether person’s underlying conditions cause death cytokine storm erupts. Neither things specifically age-dependent, advanced age generally yields underlying conditions. 

A 17 year old girl Ft Myers, blocks parents, died yesterday, deniers came Reddit ranting weight. 

We need quash voices oppose science, they’re literally opposing life-saving measures. Reddit great forum everyone speak, need listening epidemiologists right now. 

Nobody needs hear Karen, wants nails done without wearin’ mask, thinks. virus ""with 5-7% mortality rate equally infectious"" pretty much contradiction terms. bug kills many people would spread well. guess imagine nightmare scenario suddenly becomes deadly long latent -- also infectious -- period, that's unlikely. can't think evolution would favor virus.

SARS-CoV-2 tenth mortality rate part **BECAUSE** takes long time get going become dangerous. time allows immune system healthy people kick out, also easy spread. Conversely, SARS-1 MERS give body breathing room, result much deadly ... transmittable.  agree. I'll try remember refer on, widespread attaching name virus probably simplest way getting weak yet egotistical mind. Shocked... Wear mask. Elon Musk tremendous piece trash handling COVID prove everyone. Yup. know lots people plenty smart enough understand human beings causing climate change vote R admitting would feel like betraying tribe. People like think better education would help ignores complex fucked human psychology really is. hard read table I’m WV honestly started rough pandemic, mostly tests. testing improved lot. tested 8.7% population, higher US average surrounding states. Free testing also available throughout lot state. 

The past couple weeks numbers spiked some, still 3% positive test results. spike due people traveling Myrtle Beach. think people probably safe beach, everyone cramming shops restaurants probably spreading. 

I proud state handled pandemic, starting get annoyed people traveling. really necessary go vacation right now? mean really? really want break, travel around state - beautiful state parks people go relax. Ugh. 

With said... Governor Jim Justice absolute worst lol  Never put gambling analogies next public safety measures, might take challenge.  Quite spike, appear Ohio large increase testing. percent positive still 5%. done earlier... call protest one complain advised them? big Zoom call? Dr. Duke quadruple bypass grandfather late 80s. Duke legend. extra kind brother I.  states take bigger question. states say ""sorry need beds citizens"" - Remember, outbidding ventilators back... We're United things good. things get tough, we're Divided States America. I’m betting man, I’m thinking actual virus going curb visitors wearing mask will. violation company policy. *defunded ""4th highest"" still better ""the highest since beginning"".     
I know can't say same. True, case need implement travel restrictions, otherwise infections leak out. interesting part:

If trend continues, hospital system capacity become overwhelmed,"" TMC leaders warned Houstonians letter Wednesday.

On Thursday, four CEOs signed letter backed off, saying level alarm ""unwarranted.""

hmmmm Great, states hit early on, California, Washington, Ohio starting surge reopening. long NY New England start back again? Yes, much obvious point option left us, go work essential worker. sit ass home watch world crumble.  Another really large retail make company (won’t say rhymes Gamora) headed direction. protections workers? Go find another job market 25% unemployment rate? Ha! got us balls. Well one side suicidal. virus won: massive protests would boycott Tesla can’t afford first place.  Well everyone common sense did. bet governor knew would happen, like politicians, care long looks good. That’s cancer spreads ok Maybe arrested then. Send FBI national guard. coach sucks   understand hate doomsday person. mean fudging numbers [like rephrase myself... China Florida fudge numbers, one else.

EDIT: Oops, forgot [Virginia, Texas, Vermont still report though. using phone record video voice conversation appropriate. wearing masks means you’re decent person? come to? tell 'em free will!

Smh. Interesting, thanks reply find hard blame anybody. stuff wildly contagious it’s endemic. going keep springing up. matter originated, going nightmare. blame starts know it’s dangerous know things could mitigate continue nothing. LA county public transit?  Agreed I’m sorry pain thank laugh!  course true. true hospitals U.S., especially huge big city ones. certain ""free"" capacity regular ICU beds, used patients, that's typically low matter business practice. easily shift things around create capacity crisis. I'd say governor state nimcompoop mean doctors run Texas Medical (or facility) are. Ya wasn’t talking spreading cancer speaking lot viruses cause cancer like HPV... Good point, demands cause people act opposite way. There's literally nothing done that. way try communicate find middle ground convince wear mask. Anytime mention things people want think scary, prepared downvotes.
 
And record, agree you. understand half thing yet, everyone pretending best thing ignore go back living. Also losing medical staff virus. war I've heard losing medical professionals like losing general. friends Boston worked peak COVID getting nice freebies. deserve more!  China generally stable economic crisi due unique manufacturing industry I've seen two different fully credible studies lately. One showed 70% 65 asymptomatic. working age people 10% asymptomatic. believe difference two studies hard looked symptoms.

Also, study, 40/60 blood donors Castiglione D'Adda antibodies one point. 78 people died town 4600. 

There surveys elsewhere North Italy 50-60% range. They're Italian though. Yeah, too. It’s gives hope chicagoian seeing people wear masks outside. It’s least help I’m glad people much deaths US's count officaly ""explodes"" reckon ? nah. problem beyond personal choice, strong public health policy needed trust anyone like you. especially concerned two 60+ family members well. They'll house together around people besides person Covid. seems odds they'll okay wish would wait days least. last 10 years US had:

- Hard Rock Hotel collapse New Orleans 3 dead

- Florida International University Bridge collapse 6 dead

- New York apartment building collapsing 12 injured

- I-5 Skagit River Bridge collapse 3 injured

- 22nd Market Building Collapse Philly 6 dead

- Indiana State Fair stage collapse 7 dead

several injured/dead

given happens time wont problems finding incidents China 180,000 seems low based current course sure. trust investigators release findings broader scientific community independently verify work. It’s just... damn. used think CDC badass. I’m mindset inaction fumbles January February large part responsible hundreds thousands deaths we’ve had. coordinated federal response testing tracing agency early would given us much head start virus. hope go restructuring Orange One isn’t re-elected fall. Fuck guy. rusty, coronavirus covered spork. don’t judge high, literally high. Tuition gone every year due government backed loans. use money invest frivolous amenities, lead higher prices. 

I love you’re calling ass administrators gambled people’s livelihoods decades.

I hope crumble stronger sustainable system takes place. us first half... gonna lie maxed ""normal"" capacity according stats. additional surge capacity expect become ""unsustainable"" (whatever means) 12 days.

Teens that, believe never worked office-

Executives constantly say things aren’t true shape employee behavior consumer perception business (of course individual executives willing this, enough it’s common). Messages come top level reliable indicators actual situation. Extremely generous. can't tell number times I've seen heard people say, ""You guys use birth control condom/You still use condoms??"" yet, it’s matter time.

Normal capacity approached 100% 25% surge capacity provide hundreds ICU beds.

If fills near 50% surge, patients get crap care cuz personel overwhelmed death rates climb.

TX averaged 280 hospitalizations day 350 net gain today, it’s speeding up. Unless Texas enacts drastic measures hospitalizations gonna climb.

I think Texas still time prepare it’s already late change tide. guess stance Trumps tweets. 
'Just hyperboles'....I see Ha ha ha fuck Tesla may die, sacrifice I'm willing make. Yep. grandmother pushing 91 family members 60 want husband come offcial burial grandfather’s ashes July 6th. husband politely tell thank invite, attending. retired. working whole shelter place. go work home, going essentials. 

We really miss Friday nights Saturdays friends beers food. Gee, would thought consequence voting less government stubborn inaction might mean shit hitting fan emergency happens? Pretty sure called cognitive dissonance. moments pause Fox get nervous nauseous. don’t laugh all. Well seems lot shit going wrong make elective surgery reason ICU full. mom deleted step right direction. stopped using Instagram twitter month ago Yup, lots protests Houston medical center notes case load hospitals three times cases seven days ago.

They probably panicking know exponential growth is, realize hospitalizations lag reality 2-3 weeks. 3x case load previous week maybe 3 weeks leveling things shut today. math... mean covid 90% less problematic previously thought?? USA: tracks percentage tests coming back positive,  information trend graph, nice graph present national tests vs positive results. Shut pathetic simp really case. we're seeing right people showing hospital skewed younger (because they're one absorbed whole ""it's dangerous old people"" thing). Yeah, they're less likely die, we're seeing lower CFR, still deadly sick take bed hospital.

[Here's Dr. Eric Topol talking  Oh, Bill Gates' MOM helped him? what? Sway PTA? MOM helped build world's first computer??? Gates dropped HARVARD took risk.

Next going tell Jeff Bezos born literal Amazon, lol. parents helped quit job loaning 2 canoes start business. Thank sharing. wish you, family, survivors... sincere wishes peace,prosperity, vibrancy longevity.  Yes. interesting data coming slowly. implications little bit mind-boggling. Ok, lets cut half say 60,000 died covid America. still horrible. Unskew :p Seriously, bit weird. wonder what's data.  Shit goes wrong ? There's risk type surgery. Nah loves precious football money.  may reasonable take I've seen it. Thanks, analhacker 3000 game you? Jeff owns Washington post.
Nothing needs said Higher, due active cases. I'm dude, dude. Nice stealth-edit comment though. Classy. understand that. questioning benefits existing widely available technologies. could contact termination, ""failure return work"". Seems legit Actually, recent years we've growing number people, often young ones, paid hour. need work much can, get offer employer. Sometimes know wake morning gonna day work not. 

These working nursing homes home care. can't afford stay home ""a little cold"", meaning could easily spread virus. 3 kids decided accept risk seeing 4 people (all grandparents) pandemic. One set grandparents already virus, btw. people important family see knows long also sometimes depend child care. see anyone else.  go anywhere. even get groceries delivered. 

I find quite disturbing honestly worrisome people seem find difference inviting 4 family members visit us masked spread huge backyard, family story party 25 indoors, hugging masks. I'm sorry seeing two thing absolutely irrational.

If single person wants never leave home again, absolutely choice so. acting like anyone dares step foot outside, even they're following rules safety precautions, war criminal pretty unhealthy imo. FUCKING ARTICLE TROLL less requiring ICU

As percentage testing, maybe. terms raw numbers, unless I’m missing something, particular ICU today April.

Funny country decides enough un-fair trade deals it’s big bad boogie man. Wow, reach. Willful negligence wonder true, trying avoid panic, know hard many goverments pushing pandemic downplayed. even lies propaganda. even second, believe Dr. Fauci responsible anything protests unfortunate riots, beyond tangible fiction, much less taken reality, scream ""holy shit, serious"" disconnect reality many people, feel dangerous virus. really good point. likely took stress NYC. can't imagine excess death toll would turned city bare bones essential workers ghost town. ways analyzing data look whether rate accelerating not. playing word games avoid confronting reality. I'm sick tired conspiracy theorists reddit. seem focused Elon Musk 1. billionaire 2. threatening gas guzzlers. bring bs stories Errol Musks' blood emeralds every time read something Tesla.
Pretty sad ask me. better postpone back school order well. way true. sure information saying 11 days maximum person could still contagious *after* fully recovered? You’d talking closure many businesses good, unemployment rate rising even higher astronomical rate it’s currently at

At rate things going, exactly headed, shutdown not. 

This country enough resources get us this. problem would rather people die tax little more. stance healthcare coverage.

If so-called President actually taken seriously back told coming, facing need second shut down. let take political hit one, deserves it. Totally agree. EU total shitshow mid-march. become complacent. need realize sputnik moment need shape up. extremely mild cough presented minutes ago, went away, go get tested case? Coughing one symptoms, gone recently, times group friends, I? panicking? reason sub still enforcing rules political speech.

And still allows purely political articles happen Coronavirus. federal government spent much effort fighting coronavirus retaliating whistleblowers Dr Bright Firstly, agree 100%.

Secondly, love used word copacetic! science part article \_that\_ UV light short wavelength need shielded human cells, \_can\_be\_ installed occupied spaces.  Don’t forget put order refrigerated trucks. going need them. Most... research, wake sheeple!

-- guy work Well guess true American's pay dead. You’ve disproved multiple times. First deniers tried the, hospitalizations matter. tried infection rate matters. they're onto the, people covid ICU. 

The first 2 conditions met. third argues point. fact ICUs generally 70% capacity. Throw bunch covid patients mess. That's are. 

There large group people denial. negatively affecting everyone. pathetic every conceivable way. Fuck me. live Houston governor still anything stopping elective surgeries. Like fucking roll back reopening piece shit! mean, that's well known corporate loophole though. Show loss, build credits, pay taxes road That's almost 9%. many cases untested unknown? that's HUGE number deaths compared CDC's 0.26% realistic 1% we're seeing elsewhere world. conservative media downplays COVID-19 convinces viewers take public health measures seriously. Also, conservative media supports going back work shocked growing trend new cases leads pausing. missing something here?  every major news outlet. contact press? unheard Gates completely fucked education system e state Washington. lobbied change laws could keep Supreme Court ruled wife. already shared Reposts removed may right, lets see fall weather gets colder, flu season also starts, people return work. know thousands medical personnel gotten virus, even though wear better PPE general public access to. 100 years society laugh time weed taboo .. animals run president. meow. Italy 10% while.

It's true numbers low, sick enough people, still many people overwhelms hospitals.

Both Italy Spain overwhelmed periods, sick health system handle. 

And shifts disaster logic, doctors basically choose two patients gets treatment, one gets die. treat youngest one obviously.

It looks like real risk Houston.   told self-quarantine, get tested. would like see done? Another shutdown? highly doubt people roll like last time they've seen damage caused it. already shared Reposts removed tbh, I'm speaking someone pro-mask side, N95s better surgical masks entire civilian, non-medically trained population. ofc people fucking stupid, even pro-mask people wearing mask covers mouth nose, fact take sneeze... hell getting downvoted? logic line, please let know went wrong. I'm combining facts questions looking ideas answers. Depends location. state already announced it’s individual districts decide. lot work experience.

How much work experience someone order give zero fucks rights work place? Free speech mean absolutely say whatever want; make free consequences, thus people's responses comment. Nobody wearing masks, I’m often one. Village market post office totally fucked virus spreads community (we apparently 3 active cases Incline right change eventually). IVGID said beaches closed non-residents they’re accepting punch cards tourists often get part deal short term rentals (which stopped February never happened)... saw two AZ license plates parking lot yesterday course people laid beach masks distancing. 

But hey least 3 ICU beds entire area unless drive Sac Reno.... Elon musk piece shit don’t believe think filled role, one else would have? pays people think pretend visionary. Get real. ""pay more, good reason, make road safer others"" number states full people know that. Apparently. far off... ""paid people thing, collected profits privy to"" defining characteristic literally every billionaire. May people stop buying sh*t go restaurant, possible deadly virus there. Absolutely. think declaring NY ""won"" Florida ""lost"" premature. would make death rate .6% Worse news: anything today pull spread rate really change much unfold next 12 days. best, anything start slow spread would present hospitals ~10 days.

So pretty much already late prevent full surge capacity. 

Texas chosen learn hard way. NY pretty good. Colorado. fault states decided masks optional. Exactly. covid deaths many treatable illnesses people start dying from. Saw article thought much hope. Politicians really care violence even give penny ask dollars deserve. 

They listen whether email screaming face. listen stuff dollar bills underwear. aunt asked last week planning visiting 4th. family lives three hours away. like, “I would love see everyone, but, don’t think it’s safe right now.” totally got it. Plus, would feel beyond awful anyone got sick. We’ve isolating super careful months, family. still. takes one person screw November, hopefully we'll get actual leadership top. Washington Post owned CEO 3rd largest corporation America. company also announced, yesterday, green energy initiative compete Tesla. trust source? Major surgery quite stress organ systems operations usually followed stay ICU. It’s things going wrong, operations require post-op ICU CEO get involved day day processes low level employees, isn’t time. Anything read CEO stuff like PR. Yep, people read headlines make major judgements without actually knowing full story. whole article clickbait. Lack common sense going take out. Podunk ICUs equipped treat sickest COVID patients demographic data? area offers them, find easy one painful one, easy, go get one somehow smarter medical scientific community. 

Big Brain Time Narcissistic personality disorder Says douche used ""them goal posts"" stfu *""Mah body mah choice!""* /s dad mid-70s never wore protection construction career. lucky managed stay healthy whole time, many employees friends got really sick. He's one guys shrugs safety like unnecessary. day still doesn't. hearing shit never wore noise protection around loud machines. We've already sending adult patients children's hospital due this. Let's hope. vote! (As far understand) virus attacks blood cells destroy order replicate causing clots yes, molecules also attack blood cells get rid virus cause futher cell destruction. 

So all, infected individual suffers lot cell damage everywhere, blood clots lung tissue breaking down. die virus molecules results much dead tissue body. 

If prevent immunity molecules much damage, really help people lot.  
Excuse me, stated something. ready stand it. onus give source. Good call. Also, 90k year Bay Area like 50k “normal” places. decent salary, good may seem surface.  Glad Donald could take moment post topic, many UV lightwaves away Mother Twitter. think movies TV shows watched years CDC last hope stopping pandemic zombie apocalypse.

Now darkest hour, hundred year pandemic, CDC real life turning to.....Tiktok. RemindMe! 3 Months Well apologize, article posted lot information last focused differently think classified ""same information"" he? LOL you’re what’s wrong America look size nyc international airport...  X due respect completely disagree Fb def coming back mlb already announced returning well. good idea? Prob happening? likely true, employment huge problem. made harder people get unemployment, making people choose health able survive.

The actions state impact know need follow guidelines. get forced positions comfortable with. mean, he's maskless rallies current national hotspots filled even *own* loyal voters. literally *no one* cares about...even people. 

Quite literally, people rallies guaranteed votes November going die election direct result actions. direct self-sabotage would almost funny macabre. Maybe bleech deactivate protease?  build rockets space. never profitable history rockets going space. it? run Elon outside Tesla? answer obvious. loses way much money. Elon busy? many companies? pump Elons brand. Elon brand. allows raise money suckers continue raise shitloads money sell $1 $0.90 get paid $0.50 so. Look scam: people think SpaceX elon's hobby project. No, he's stealing peoples money every way knows how: Futurology + Celebrity. Elon's net worth keeps going despite unprofitable businesses. used call scams. call growth stocks. real product stock. reason get funding people want shares dump retailers IPO. Nobody honestly thinks ever make money going concern took lot grit. little thing called 14th Amendment.  person exempt law. 

Most states quarantine statutes say, people may self-quarantine, voluntarily quarantine, anyone refuses *shall be* arrested forced quarantine custody. 

I see anything law says, apply elected officials. We'll see days buddy. exactly ""reasoning"" boss gave me. stared stunned disbelief, unable respond callous idiocy. stupidity, burns! Cuomo murdered people nursing homes, go fuck himself. Pretty much everything said word salad nonsense, one thing particular stands IQ tests

You realize IQ tests haven’t administered like 30 years value determining intelligence? they’re extremely biased degree citing “IQ” measurement intelligence outdated phrenology. Oh...you probably believe phrenology too. Idk NRW State Premier, Armin Laschet used strong language recent press conference. said largest individual outbreak Germany since start pandemic outbreak potentially enormous pandemic risk due geographical location plant's international work force. less, locking region potential explosive. anything? got start taking 20k investment turning 10 million dollar company.

The man knows business technology, found niche developed software sold well. He’s self made. Businesses request ""short time work"" money gov, everyone retains least bearable amount money. really sick, health insurance takes full payment, 6 weeks. that, drop ""Krankengeld"", less bad some, get that. employer pay dime (apart expenses keep office whatever available). also cannot get fired influence holidays (maybe unless spans many weeks months, sure). Usually, call sick 1 2 days without see doc. 3 days on, need sick leave recipe doc.

To experience, notice getting sick use one two days, usually fine day 3. not, often results sick leave days. Responsible bosses also send home appear sick. 

If employees try exploit 2 days without recipe, ordered hand one even one day, must warranted strong evidence.

Oh, jobs come round 30 days holidays.

Overall, pretty fair, still try exploit workers. Preferably know rights. Btw everyone job Germany company registered rights (with exceptions) Yeah sure They're anti-union, they're PRO-ASSOCIATE. 🙄 family quick stop WV bathroom break traveling.  area (somewhat populated) masks food places saw (patrons employees) sign another business read ""Can agree that's enough masks public already"". would venture say WV's cases grossly understated.  mfs won’t wear mask, they’re definitely getting vaccine. speak Sweden's favor Norwegians consider Gotland unsafe travel to? 

... Opposite Day today? home tests public month. several options explained here: personally used Labcorps tests received negative results two days. ex-terminated 🙃 One three states that’s actually contained virus. Hardest hit early due population density. 

What think Florida’s response? employees need gaming rooms massages personal compliments order job. 

You understand labor market thing, right? sometimes employees bring table specialized skills, experience, expertise, right? 

And competitive job market -- might bad idea offer perks? stressful work environment, might bad idea provide things would help mental health otherwise stimulate productivity? people good working hard begin with. 

What kind work talking here? considered paying low wages attitude might make difficult attract desirable candidates? 100 people aren’t spoiled would job without fighting whole time. 

Sounds super scientific. So, basically, think it'd better fire anyone complained unsafe work conditions employees cool unnecessary risks? basically demonstrating reason don’t constantly fight life make harder themselves.

Didn't talk much sacrifice made? owes job. 

Okay, that's discussion about, it? 

You seem like real peach human being. catch corona morons charge. Getting whiff menthol-y purse takes right back childhood. what’s fucking annoying.

Elective surgeries aren’t things like breast implants facelifts. 

These serious surgeries, cancer removal, aren’t necessarily IMMEDIATELY life threatening.

These surgeries diseases aren’t preventable. 

**BUT COVID IS.**

When don’t wear mask, don’t socially distance. go bar restaurant party, aren’t increasing risk someone could die COVID.

 **You’re increasing odds someone could die non-preventable disease.**  One thing undeniable, FL lot time take right decision prepare. seems wasted... sure? Sweden perfect example fuck economy killing citizens neighbors. Sweden's ""success"" basis argument, terribly misinformed everything. horrifying. People make sure they’re basic health shit like wearing mask washing hands. entire family sees stories justifies gatherings saying, ""well we've always strong immune systems"" we're special happen us. people get infected weak. different rest, guy called coup? means ways stay holed long period time. burgers, groceries, gas station snaks delivered us.

lmao delivered us robots/drones? really mean say ""we""? 

The people unlucky enough they'll go broke without delivering uber eats neckbeard software developers ""we"" group addition, COVID-19 may triggering type 1 diabetes people healthy before. may stimulating immune response attacks beta cells pancreas. accurate, completely fucking wrong. I'm shocked! Said nobody common sense. tl;dr

Florida low IQ version China/Russia. Desantis low IQ version Putin/Xi. title makes sound like still bodies one collected. collected fire department. quote seems height pandemic.

Edit: article. It’s current issue.


“Between end March beginning April, Madrid region overwhelmed thousands coronavirus cases hundreds deaths day. bodies many elderly patients left abandoned. firefighters arrived.” Would make much difference? mean, worked finance department automobile company. guarantee lot secrets leak guys floor. They’re still rise now, mandatory mask thing new. enacted earlier week even though NC rise, they’re quite Florida/Texas/Arizona levels rise.

Hopefully helps stop getting there.  Meanwhile USA record breaking covid cases lockdown parameters put place us protect citizens. pathetic. thumbnail looked like pushing girl fence lol Whaboutism. love see it. Unless, course, die. BS keeps up.  seems like hospitals going full time. Wouldnt first choice obviously given circumstances... US’s way dealing pandemic der Befragung der Ischglerinnen und Ischgler gaben viele an, dass sie unter Geschmacks- und Geruchsverlust den Wochen vor den Testungen litten.

I understood part part diagnosed, might mistake. Thanks! lives mean nothing long Trump, (politician-level) political supporters, business / wealthy elite patrons safe. ""safe"" means ""our wealth remains intact increases"" wealth always translates ""we buy power"".

He care people voted him. care people vote him. little data points (SimCitizens) shitty version SimWhiteHaus he's playing. thing SimHotelz ""little"" people build shafted pay, SimMeatz, Sim(p)University, Sim(p)Charity.

None us really exist actual living beings -- narcissistic traits, also socioeconomic class even comprehend life like outside bubble. Pandemics bad worse happened happen better medical science deal ever past. much sucks, think definitely better nuclear Armageddon. mean seems like call show right? sounds like panic attack explain taste thing. still smell?  California's counties huge

Exactly. Cities like Riverside Palm Springs county, yet ""no reason, go collect shells daddy mommy let daddy drink beers"" Real men use safety equipment

Yep. absurd people would taunt someone taking reasonable safety precautions. seem understand safety equipment sometimes, rest time protect STRAY MORONS. 

Without PPE, I'd much less attractive and/or actually dead. bike accident worn helmet, would lost teeth, destroyed face, potentially brain damaged - still stitches cosmetic procedures, got walked away it. 
I would've killed t-bone collision using seat belt - t-boned kid ran red light old metal Blazer. I've never caused collision driver 20 years driving, I've 6 car accidents passenger.

The brother mentioned working fracking fields got home, saw people die lose limbs multiple times safety violations. Worrying seeming masculine seems pretty stupid coworkers know lost leg, arm, eyeball, severely disabled rest lives. 

If someone asks, SCARED? like, yeah, heavy machinery deadly pandemic viruses play chicken. China lock down. cities far away Wuhan, enter unless resident. also limitations many times person could leave home every week. limitation whole household.  far everyone actually votes. Dont assume stay home Researches look causes new cases rise 100 thousand deaths. often not, find leaders followed advice experts field lot deaths could avoided. get political blame politicians?

If leader nation encouraging people wear mask wearing one himself, downplaying virus, serious offense opinion puts peoples lives risk.  

I see reason discuss here. I'm sorry happening you. got certified teacher NYC hiring freeze, massive educational budget cuts, feeling comfortable 1,000+ building kids, get saying. mad people give two shits lives lost care they'll able watch tv. bwahahahaha. trying think something older around generation, absolutely correct. Felix rivalled Dali surrealism, criminally underrated.  scariest part needing bed. anything happens you’re fucked. Car accident? Stroke, heart attack? There’s room you. It’s full, don’t get hurt sick period. always excuse. ""Our medical system different"" ""they're way crowded us""  virus clearly going anywhere anytime soon. Alot US states bad April May like Texas picking There's reason Canada lower death rate US except Donald Trump. extra deaths head. Watch administration shift closing election sights covid, allowing absentee voting. Trump going try steal election Cite source please since completely wrong pray Oklahoma survives dumb Governor. Lol, fomites everywhere too.  Word. I'm still angry, though. Helplessly watching slow-motion trainwreck gets bit taxing psyche. would actually love see sort PSA living former presidents urging Americans work together defeat COVID wearing masks staying home much possible. election year, almost certainly yes. 

Biggest question they're going continue supporting businesses Payday Protection loans (they probably won't), new unemployment support 600/wk goes away end July (I'd bet yes, probably like 300/wk, they're going bail states (I'd bet yes, even though GOP really like this, think they'll screw economy badly four months election). New plan. Stay inside let natural selection play out. nearly every sense IN, OH, WI, IA, etc little mask usage. issues there. Hey, I’m taking sides, genuinely curious: way believe goal posts moved? Yeah, many Californians calling state shut down. imagine information got out.

The comment said “The US first [in] spades, next nothing two.”  35% Americans voted live Alabama. business would required make accommodations them, like curbside pick up, let in. Bergamo higher makes sense population older, average age 45

Yes. That's dealing with. 

They still receive money because, they're working essential job like grocery store worker medical staff, they're putting others risk there. Even they're working home, *still* get money. 

The economy suffering many businesses close down. put money hands people use put money back whatever businesses still open? circulate much money back economy can? appears foreigner country ""everyone wore masks"". *We didn’t start Rona* 

*it always burnin since world’s turnin* Sure lack behind, time seems lag never ends.

But is. NC numbers shit much better many SE states. we're going rag states, SC, Georgia, Florida, Alabama would much better start with. mean technically pull guy going 8 speed limit, god, folks going 20 over? ACTUALLY UNHEALTHY WEAR MASK. HUMANS CANT WEAR 

NO DONT THINK DOCTORS, NURSES, SCIENTISTS, CONSTRUCTION WORKERS, ELECTRICIANS, CARPET CLEANERS, PAINTERS, PEOPLE WORKING CHEMICALS LITERALLY EVERY ONE MAKING MASKS COUNTS court system screwed up, delay countermeasures indefinitely. checks balances.

Good luck! hope able make work! Masks make rebreathe virus terrorist constitution. wear mask fucking potato. I'm pretty sure read linked, scenario, number infections multiplies constant factor day, called exponential growth. used simplistic model infection could potentially spread population.

Most people can't (or won't) distinguish exponential geometric functions, influenced media (and document) discusses ""exponential"" growth respect disease transmission. Something doesn’t perfect order good. Nothing, even vaccine, would prevent 100% infections point. need minimize them. No, it’s Brandon Sanderson’s fantasy series Stormlight Archive. Cases always going surge reopening. Add protests equation course going cases. 

What really matters ICU #s deaths. far haven’t surged. median age infections way now. I’d really surprised California gets death surge.  old codger don’t understand that. assume phones: talk, text, FaceTime kinds social media communicate.  library card, access lots movies, books, audiobooks. Thanks! is. stay safe too. majority northeast cities canceling them. rest country....who knows continues blow mind resistant Governors masks. Mandating seems obvious solution. even short that, aggressively pushing normalizing (e.g. wearing one fucking press conferences) would probably impact. needs boycott. even wear mask?  Yeah kind want create panic. do, rest population destroy one another survive. could resolve another way. I'm wondering extending 2 weeks already know going end anytime soon. Okay. comment? hindsight, Australia NZ gone lockdown straightaway unlike northern hemisphere, flu seasons started back February crunch hospital beds. they're trying open flu season reaches traditional peak months July August. two valid paths towards herd immunity community spread vaccine. Otoh flu season mild borders still closed. typical flu season Australia sees 1500-3000 deaths flu 3000-4000 deaths pneumonia. far 100 CV deaths. Coumo strategy. Wtf - said kill them? give people tickets drive dangerously put lives risk. violating mask laws. repeated violations require jail time.

The fact jumped straight murder shows seriously unhinged. confuses people arrive beach, see crowd think ‘yep! wanna part that’. Even normal day never mind middle pandemic. might right maybe not. think another shutdown, people might wake fact wear masks anytime we're around people households (and maybe sometimes even then).

And many people, it’s nothing prevention didn’t even work. maybe prayed really really hard god would sent angel telling password. anyone asked tried that? increased testing, percentage positive tests would stay go down. Unfortunately, going up, would indicate actual increase cases. Deaths follow trajectory, there's data floating around median age cases skewing much younger second wave, death count may severe. there's big question mark next that, tests harder get, severe cases (and usually oldest people) got tests first. may seeing actual cross-section who's getting virus. would mean higher case counts, still *lot* deaths.  everyone let's get sick!

Let's catch rona get stuck 7 figure hospital bills! Plenty beds fill y'all!

What's point? aware masks disappeared shelves general public United States aware happening? work company regularly uses N95 masks back January everything suddenly disappeared shelves suppliers. us, seemed happen overnight. One day orders fulfilled employees could go Home Depot, Lowes, home improvement store purchase PPE like N95 masks goggles next thing know everything gone--Shelves empty local stores regular orders ultimately cancelled.

Wearing masks would easy masks available. shocked found Strategic National Stockpile masks.

We get screwed aware happened back early January get informed. basically even take much reach point overwhelming American healthcare system. already known that, sad fact is. do

I'm American, stop even sweden fuck like USA 

Keep coping Euro-tard. Sweden cases per capita good invention. cards make sure police write names tickets correctly. r/thathappened I'm nobody went back work last Monday Michigan. everything power protect exposure, everything power protect others misinformation lackadaisical attitude towards virus. I've bought pulse oximeters, thermometers, vitamin D, sanitizers emergency supplies everyone immediate circle. Beaten everyone head facts again. stressed prepare worst without hoarding things short supply.

I cut hair. I'm still eating food (rice, beans, vegetables, etc..) stocked March, sheltered place. rotate 5 medical masks also wear cloth masks those, safety glasses shield eyes. go anywhere unless I'm picking grocery order going work.

The outbreak bar Lansing led coworker's daughter get tested, told today. hope never meet either, want know I've never tried harder conduit positive influence others. 

Thank you! hurrr Smart, still think planning phase 3 July 6 NYC could little hasty since involved indoor dining. wait extra week two? That's scary hear hospital, exactly watched happen China, Italy New York. wish best hope make unscathed.
 
May ask state live in? basically yes, no, maybe.  I'll curious see excess deaths expected average looks like Texas months. average IQ US 98. yes, fully half country that. wondering state stacks up, [this Inc breaks down. California close bottom, 95.5; Massachusetts top 104.3.  pa friends still don’t wear masks. sure part pa live in, go (in center city phila) errands.... many social distance (even small children) wear masks. 

phila county phase yellow hopefully don’t go green come early july. stupid argument. I'm allowed opinion something buy, especially something effects macro economy.

Student loan bubble $1T+. affects everyone indirectly. university pricing absolute disgrace, leads situations like one described article.

Unless think pushing loans onto susceptible young people understand finance good idea.  Thx lead Yup still butt lol target Even shut today. Experience rest world shows gets worse peaks 2-3 weeks. Southern states tough time might remember, forecasting reach 100% next week, Monday. That’s fast moving. YEAH BUDDY.  knowing masks quarantines work minor misses embarrassment field epidemiology. Yeah, numbers keep growing, slowly surely. 

As America, without major shift attitude compliance, slow stop. Read headline. read actual exchange. Journalistic gymnastics. know else spell people. headed unchartered territory.

Italy. Every single new thing hear company walking/talking turd founded confirms fact said musky turd fact sentient shit stain underwear world. Heh, feel like electric cars another way produce tons chemical trash instead atmospheric CO2, completely useless surf current trend. solution reside reducing movements altogether great public transports everywhere, none companies want that, obivously. Choo, choo, motherfucker! *burp* Close what’s going without deeper understanding implications. younger folks spread virus far wide it’s going wildfire. Hello. someone please help brain injury ever since really hard time grokking visual information.  I'm sure everything means decipher information. 


I'm looking graphs Alameda County, California. questions are:
What various lines? mean? one line look at?  information need glean graphs, overall takeaway? 

Please make fun me, I'm admitting know asking help. know probably looks simple everyone may well spiderweb understand it.  something nice say, please say it. I'm troll. serious question. Thank insight. Yeah, I'm sure Specialties better others forget saying making bunch mistakes ventilator pressure end they're best circumstances, Shirley matter kind doctor would better figuring ventilator us people sub month ago calling us Doomers "" MEDIA SAID HOSPITALS WOULD FULL!

That's tempting fate best absolutely understanding purpose crisis mitigation. 


So stupid PROUD stupidity. Idiots. Target utilize union labor building remodeling stores though, unlike many others. don’t buy product, it’s simple. preemptive than? source?

Your second point argued common sense, insightful. Texas Children's Hospital 3000 beds. Try less 1000. Hugo Drax Every day science doctors learn virus treatment options. example 10 days drug proven reduce risk death significantly COVID-19 patients ventilation much 35% patients oxygen 20%, reducing total 28-day mortality rate 17%."" No. influenza recently enough could make things worse. They're respiratory infections damage lungs. one worried sports right now. Stay home much possible. they’ve warned about. shouldn’t come surprise, extremely sad think people lose lives it. comment nailed it. Esta cabron I've played video game Plague Inc., usually pretty hard start transmission airplane unless specifically evolve virus make transmittable airplanes.

I feel like video game experience puts level Reddit epidemiologists might comment this. report comments like? Fox Business know this.

McConnell said approve relief without immunity big business Pelosi's House decided go recess. Senate go Recess July. Also KHOU: Cincinnati literally northern edge Ohio River. southern edge Kentucky. They're close pedestrian-only bridge take ballparks Cincinnati mall KY.

Lots people live KY commute Cincy work. Yeah it’s full normally still week surge capacity like facts here. get close smell rose, shit stinks mile away. article may missing point. people know wearing masks much anti-science pro-freedom. is, deny science claim virus hoax. beef government telling do. feel like government's job give accurate information, give orders people information.

I agree them, think they're foolish. important realistic understanding people think do. Otherwise hard find common ground make progress. face public every day. Trust me, they’re there. *still* hear Plandemic talking points.

How lie like say permanent damage people looking kidneys right now?

Additionally, edit lying about? Big enough lie, big enough defend lie? Without randomized sample mass test, extrapolation self-selected volunteers population large suspect. think almost makes worth it. plan along? Wtf on, jeez fair, hard remember rules. social distancing staying 6 feet apart, 6 millimeters?

Should stay home I'm symptomatic go party?

Don't get started masks. confusing. possible buy one pregnancy-type antibody rapid tests online?

(These little pieces plastic prick finger put blood test.) Like miracle, go away. less way see it. would rather hold prices leave units empty rather lowering standards here. company/companies also owns large amounts unit count multiple states, letting spread risk rentals. 

I means think ""anyone rents single building landlord poor"" happens? Like couple days ago predicting would take weeks, right? Holy shit No, go hospital. take care you. resources stretched thin, nurses doctors fatigued. still get care risk medical errors infection go significantly. Wait people sounded alarm called alarm unwarranted??

Who called bullied trying claw back visibly prudent warning?? fuck? second wave coming directly first going far damage economy locking entire country 30 days right beginning would have. blame specific party courting ignorance current predicament. preventable politicians indulge others ignorance instead lead necessary get go. NY 33 cases per million rolling 7 day now. Top 7 country.

NY open epidemic like Florida, Texas Arizona. great *Hermain Cain* would yo self Guys, side effect using UV light (not sure one used experiment) ducts production Ozone fucken toxic. careful this. effective UV light intensity eliminate viruses duct requires 10x power usually advertised . MERV 13 filter combined higher outdoor air % job. wear mask move on. really isn’t big deal. work hospital wearing masks everyday since mid March. easy thing keep everyone safe. 

If don’t like wearing mask, hate ventilator even more. hope never return tell truth! may sound crazy, anyone willingly volunteer get infected antibodies donate plasma save others? someone perfectly healthy good chance beat it, would possible? Army Corps Engineers scouted designed 100s hotel hospital conversions take two three days build. literally waiting Governors say “build it”. hope there, know governors reluctant pull trigger kind spending.

February one guaranteed paycheck. Californian here. They're actually pretty effective used correctly—the operative word ""correctly."" Lots people wearing masks all, soooo... ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ wish US would system like NHS American health care huge business thats going away without fight advice lobby health care reform like people lobbying protesting police reform Found troll. that’s mean. Take Zip2 example; didn’t take idea make better succeed it, meeting inventor technology guise applying job, ghosted dude, sprang later exact idea. There’s business, there’s piece shit. Musk hasn’t earned single thing he’s ever ‘achieved,’ start daddies emerald money Tesla SpaceX, he’s hack. could said whatever assertions might make direction. country theme parks open? Houston we've got problem! Source? going happen US. Unlike Asian country different mentality. Put politics situation half country stand head government says stand feet. perpetuates problem. Maybe CNN shouldnt promoting younger generation go protest. happen narrative give already  Maybe CRNA. nurse anesthetist.  American, think I'll international travel anytime soon. can't spell slaughter without laughter. Again, imho truly awful disturbing folks sub posters clearly work hard minimize dismiss pandemic. create general straw men, calling rightfully worried free fall, ""doomers""

But you. truly find disturbed alarmed folks, power you. Perhaps people rude idk would even mention choice host small family gathering :') died cause wear mask 🤷🏽‍♀️ anyone wants source information. xD Global trade contract 11.9% year.

Jesus Christ. 

And contrast much people made this. Yep, overtook Cook County, IL Chicago is. live starting trend upwards again, 500, 600, 650, 700, 750 today 900 cases. things keep opening people keep taking less seriously, presume upward trend continue.  isolating would deadly then? 2020 go longest year record go hand hand choosing lockdown directly impacts healthy economy not. think mean opposite said. However disagree, definitely relation economy choosing lockdown. hospital system work runs beds fairly regularly. However able hold patients ED ED gets full knows. want get rid public schools, army, police, fire departments, roads, government agencies, border patrol, sea rescue on? willing pay demand those, ever need them, instead paying taxes?

By way: pay less health care Germany American average earn German average. Knowing still Mom got cancer throat without crushing existence debts treatment, 4 times dad broke disk spine works like horse 45 years, I'm happy everyone gets treated without receiving individual bill.

Also: remembered pay maximum amount public healthcare insurance, limited earn around 4700€/months. opinion, 100% convinced. believe case Europe too. November slated month biiiig shit whole world monster cycles back Northern hemisphere outbreaks taking advantage complacency ended lockdowns. No. 

Outdoors PPE relatively safe. indoors social gatherings risky.

Bars, churches, birthday parties. risky. Outdoors mask rally low risk. We’re 1/7th way!!! Open er up!!! Yeah, I'm hoping states close enough trigger recount. do, tipping point ones matter wow thats fucked up... ""But can't get away it.""

-People last 4 years. tldr: thing did, okay we're right they're wrong.

the way justifying downplaying thousand people packed together pandemic protest police violence demand equality, justified downplayed going back work avoid bankruptcy feed families. Nope, gotta go make someone else money company ""blessed"" able pandemic. Hazard pay? Nah. Got sweet disposable mask though. Shoot me. tried forcing work cash register exposing everyone

Given track record US general US companies particular, worry know answer already, ask: cashiers protected getting virus way US? Like enclosed plexiglass cabin around register small openings pay retrieve goods? least pexiglass face shields, get cabin? common practice Germany, well obligation customers wear masks inside stores. way less cases you, safety measssures still effect nonetheless. messaging going work. many young people know -- think know -- otherwise. correct messaging ""you might get sick,"" ""be good person get people REALLY sick"". Tesla never go bankrupt they've running investor money almost entire life. also marketing like others mouth-to-mouth. ever drove one want one. Yes actually per capita tested anybody. link shows this! 

Anything jerk anti-american sentiment though right, even even able interpret statistics. Anything jerk america paying ICU nurses 10,000$ week travel too. cut contracts second didn’t need them. nurses won’t stupid go back second round good pay 2 weeks joblessness  Count that! Where’s haircut Karen at? Within cells interlinked.  Haven’t even Hannity McConnell also urged mask wearing recent past well?

Is Fox News whole still telling people wear masks days? Obv Prez governors still urging people wear masks, going take people listen wear damn masks?

If Trump starts wearing mask asking people even going listen him? though circle jerk. think decrease avg age due testing available.

Last time around severe symptoms get tested, would skew avg age higher. get testing freely, avg age decreases accurately reflects reality. Younger people typically come contact ppl older surprising get infected There's notable progress last days. Several muncipalities require masks public private businesses now. seems people kinda sorta starting get picture. ain't much, step last week. think would get staying home etc? How? Considering state even started take preventative measures, see way another 2-3 weeks explosive increases. CDC completely hemmed in. used one best world controlled every turn people understanding science.

This honestly devastating career scientists CDC watch this. Many career positions pretty apolitical overall (have go multiple administrations). worse that. [state health integral keeping Ohio's infected numbers low resigned due lots idiots closings. wonder people states informed increases cases news sources?  gives shit. fat man magic time running out. Why? media make data choose release it. coming months, find new virus, good. Waffle House index new millennium? Soo... lockdown V2? way get lawmakers would that. literally go Yelling Fire Crowded Theater ruling. Ruby Princess quarantined 14 days hotel could finally leave ship, showed symptoms tested positive days leaving hotel.

There couple people flown back overseas (last month?) quarantined 14 days flying, test positive days later here.

There lots cases like around world. Scientists found people take 23 days start showing symptoms.

Google it, see cases. also aren’t guaranteed get COVID would like sticking hand bowl maybe grabbing one eat. fucking joke.
Everything open full capacity point. . . .and Florida backwards.

On monitor. edgy stuff, kid reference: See Great Haircut Protests WAY back year April 2020. getting fired better unpaid leave? collect unemployment. hesitate join /r/COVID19positive/ We're many folks sharing experience nasty bug. Good recovery you. think it’s still two weeks (ish) run surge capacity. You’re left wing lunatic. Learn self reliance realistic. Great response. Hello all! I’m going baby shower food Illinois tomorrow day illinois switches phase 4. precautions implement best protect guests? Masks also make sure virus can't spread.

Once go contact tracing, means already late, mitigation, rather prevention mode. That’s positive cases recent means 8-10X number detected cases. 170K positive test numbers means 1.5M positive cases total - untested. Since first day. It’s beyond stupid governor never anything it. basically everyone acted like didn’t exist anymore Wamazon? literally Facebook groups created fake government cards granting permission enter private businesses without mask, even mandated it, due “medical reasons” course OSHA(yes, said OSHA) disclose condition. people made mission purposely go without mask make political statement even going far cough people denied service. I’d say it’s safe say actions intensified conservative news misinformation gas lighting. translated section article

""**Mexico City entity highest number Covid-19 positives country 44,243 infected** , although ability transmit one day next decreased since last week, contrast **the number deaths doubled 24 hours, 282 new** deaths, leaving total **5,938 accumulated** ."" live Joliet currently probably right. They’re using word peak mean highest point (that we’ve far), necessarily highest point period.  favorite part, **two** employees. quick Google search says 50K employees work Tesla. employees communicate managers, managers probably communicate HR - middle pandemic - miscommunications all? worry - Texas governor announced pause reopening process - meaning, everything got us stays same, make even worse. man absolutely sociopathic idiot. followed science instead sucking Trump’s fat, veiny dick, wouldn’t position. Fucking cuck. mean function reducing liability company That's funny clever way weed dumb employees. weirdest fucking policy.

Although killed submission Texas official suggesting sacrifice grandma save economy. *That* removed political.

¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ Ohio lot better Florida regards mask. went last week 99% people wearing masks there's social distancing. drove clearwater beach see like took 45 minutes get bridge less 2 mile drive. best irony. Screaming yelling excellent way transmit. feels like we’re completely stuck, everything makes worse Definitely keeping good employer practice. Hope don’t continue going Yeah, driving 4 hours urgent care barely feasible. Yeah, given pretty hard time extending stay-at-home order end May budging even push-back idiotic protests, far looking, uh, terrible. uptick numbers last couple days early tell statistical noise something concerned about. even super fast javitz center took couple weeks set up. Yes. Big yes. firing ppl asking job. first read '80% Australian ski resorts...', quite sound accurate. hospitals data clearly trusted 3 different numbers Economic recovery tied virus. long virus here, economic hardship continue. government may act like it, people understand would rather live healthy go jobs eat. Funny huh? Activate National Disaster Medical System (NDMS) surprised cancel/postpone back school order. staff shortages. teachers ever tell wiki isnt good source?

If understand scholarly references authoritative sources function, there's reason use wikipedia. 

It stringent requirements editing pages many sites. Hahahaha.... hate here. interesting thing pandemic. u wanna know place real virus problem u need track Apple closing stores. Worst gift ever follow forecast yours.

The week May 7-13 64 time post, said 75 well. 65. 

The week that, commented 51 deaths/day still 51 averaged.

And week writing also supposed back 75 45. Result fucking US, prioritizing economy pandemic.

Fucking political IDIOTS, can't economy infected dead people.

MORONS™ seems like coupla years ago, last year bloom gone weird shit getting bad press left right idea. ""if feeling short breath, go Buc-ee's 288""

- would joke bygone era...now almost reality Somebody said two weeks, somebody said 4 days... defending approach?

You're basically wrong.

They told us buy wear masks, facial covering matter, people died.

Those facts Jack. really depends state even local area. Health Departments might post statistics like age groups, others not. Many areas aren’t even much contact tracing. gets thousands infections day area it’s pretty close impossible without huge staff. sure state type staff right now. projections: Holy shit, moron. 'Merica fuc yea, kiss ass suck ventilator! Economists said shutting would lead worse economic damage. One letter whole new meaning! protesting voter fraud, domestic terrorism, totalitarianism. guess I’m utter failure pack animal then. It’s like went checklist made sure hit boxes. Incorrect. day Yeah, they'll wearing masks. freedom. *smdh* Cleveland great lake north, Columbus dead center capital, Cincinnati south chilling Kentucky. Reads like need keep reinforcing they're right thing level, know they're not. lash try silence cognitive dissonance. lol “chances re-election” 

If don’t realize Trump going pull every voter suppression play book steal election, naive. San Antonio resident here, whole time thought escaping horror... Tbh Gen Z woke af, feel like would care least bit went post link. need get chest. America, tired taking care you. can’t handle resurgence, neither lot us. understaffed, fewer resources normally do. make sense anyone? happily make sacrifices patients, passion ability handle tragedy. *exhausting*. long visitor restrictions, working double time take care loved ones’ medical *and* emotional needs. asked us? hospitals’ government funding still withheld? PPE government seized us months ago? coworkers still furloughed home? isn’t okay. That’s education important. Especially health sciences social/cultural studies... help us expand worldview teach critical thinking skills. first thing hospitals cancel elective surgeries. free lot beds. hospital work gained 300-400 beds. 860 believe. Second hospitals inundated transfer patients ones less impacted. NYC health system tragedy horrible nursing ratios normal times.  COVID-19 make allergies/other illnesses go away, cough thousand non-covid related reasons. dentist &amp; hygienist wore face sheild, n95 surgical mask that... plus gown. wore pair goggles provided. Lots potential aerosolization going dentist office. Trans people: knew hasn’t army Corp engineers called help? higher case load two months ago peak. typically lag month two case peak peak deaths. God speed Houston. Trump told sky blue would make sure double-check. man dishonest fault. Warning: technically posted article different title headline. surprised one gets taken down. Michigan one 3 states actually track control outbreak. Remember Michigan? state heavily armed right-wing nutjobs trying force way capitol building?

Turns Governor right Lord, give Curly. Try piss 62 sounds good median strokes learn 3/4 strokes happen people 65, stroke risk doubles every decade, meaning half strokes happen 72.

62 median (the middle number set) strokes means huge increase incidence strokes among younger people set. part making America great again.

/s Cool , great evening 🙂 lost. worth discussion. believe social nets fine billions$ bailouts big companies served right trump name social help affected covid. willing sacrifice wrote including thousands lives see much safety net less fortunate. Start thinking. go swing yourself. Chip dale co-secretary state new virus learned states like New York California 🤷 Oh, geez. easy, millionaires national debt zero? Schools reopen fall looking less less likely everyday. Nah writes 5000 words something substance 300 really becomes exercise expositional writing already spike, happening months.  First money went big business primarily came form bond buying. 
 Federal Government gets money back. gifts. goal March economic activity depression able come it. real depression. help would credit crisis, leading liquidation many years economic damage. would today real depression. really come surprise? weeks back, US reopening barely locking down. Everyone Americans could see reopening utterly foolhardy, yet chose anyway. Greatest bunch idiots planet Earth. needed laugh- thanks! heard something 7k new cases today, absolutely insane! would’ve thought could’ve avoided NY pt.2 :/ Swab testing wait results. telecommute man go NY??? lot protesters wearing masks, helped made difficult police identify looters. seems south hit hardest! agreed Rubio said orange sphincter small hands...at least someone actually stood him, even odd work. Um fuck endless responsibilities employees idea about. 

You sound like typical disgruntled employee. gay thing. Lol Well, wear mask correctly, always washing sanitizing hands, stay far away customers possible, clean station time. lump everyone correct crowd. employer come safety plan, almost works, union. union would bare minimum protections. can't quit implemented said safety plan.   Firewall blocked. Pluto VP.  fun one. completely endorse this. many deaths soon follow, unfortunately Return? never left... can't Trump say that? Maybe followers listen him.... quit job service industry SC. last day last week 4 people tell “Coronavirus wasn’t real” another 10+ say, “won’t wearing mask much longer...” 

I’d rather unemployed deal people around here. I’m NJ I’ve ultrasound appointments. spouse can’t attend wear mask I’m definitely seeing doctor. I’m betting US bails landlords direct cash somewhere first second step. They're gonna set road bloackades man, need stop zombiee apocalypse  no... COVID-19 tracing pandemic issues. Yeah, statement makes piece shit. way bring someone marry them.

I'd willing consider financial arrangement I'm fucking broke. also don’t require restaurants close disclose employees test positive. Whole staffs getting it. we’re industry known working sick. virus care general public's opinion. mean, certainly *possible*, wearing masks outdoors maintained certain amount distance risk rather low. 

If took masks, talked close proximity stupid stuff uh... risk transmission obviously increases. Imagine thinking literally nobody (in America) wearing mask? Let's summarise today's statistics US according worldometer:

39 103 new cases, record (previous 39 072)

32 506 7-day rolling average new cases, record (previous 32 425). Rolling average increased yesterday 1839, number getting larger larger day.

15th consecutive day rising cases.

3rd consecutive day drop 7 day rolling average deaths. never going away bro get used it, like way air travel changed forever 911. “It would never happen here.”

This awful phrase continue battle cry every denier, even hits country, state, county, metro area.

It’s amazing. Haha see here. left /s wasn’t nothing. would undoubtably worse took less seriously early on. Except almost none true sensationalized media (un)Happiest Place Earth. look Japan 

Don't. US never anything like Japanese. true! Would Like Know More? Ya Trump pushing funding states, balanced budget. states job?? mean mass protests looting didn’t help. I’ve seen plenty business enforcing regulations Covid. I’ve also seen many people mass gatherings masks missing place. states nursing home data, shows drastic difference, instance county NJ nursing homes deaths 70% county deaths, CFR 7.7% overall...in nursing homes 26.9%, without nursing homes 2.8%. talking CFR still see drastic effect. think issue. flu. like Tuberculosis coronavirus. causes damage lungs scar tissue kidney issues, blood clots....and sure things. need get flu head isn’t hyped flu. 124,000 place Carolina coast restricted travelers.  Victoria. Thankfully state borders closed. Annastacia Palaszczuk well succumbing NSW Vic. new cases week 2 active cases state.  Depends are. country trending since mid April started gradually opening up, still continues open North start heading outside enjoy good weather. south moves super hot indoor season, probably take extra precautions. No, masks mandated suggested. According worldometers make 39,000.  #WearaMaskDUMBASS!! think something like UK, ""universal credit."" tl;dr went poorly, UBI removed safety net bad idea plus side lower risk dying thanks steroids already systems.

Heyooo.  I’m Wilmington area government launched lifeboat rowing away fast possible. much love SpaceX, contributions made private space industry, unfortunate Elon Musk awful individual. Yeah real fun watch first job. second saw one thought, ""yeah no, ain't career"" Texas. We're several states away, local school system somehow thinking already overcrowded school (by 600 students) maintain social distancing.

What truly afraid paying teachers telework. Admins can't stand concept. South Africa? Sure. told allowed system doesnt work home id essentially work thus pay. propose that? fine people right hearing maybe even trial. Many police department already announced become mask police icu beds full, surge capacity 877 more. Fellow 666, stay strong. Stay safe there! Lol loser dude   officially sanctioned events (parades whatnot) canceled, yeah, people throwing parties. city known particularly strong affinity celebrating 4th, particularly downtown area live, want anywhere near it. File one ""Great Shockers"" yes recall, reported issue (of protest corona) people, right, pointing out. said, matter science, airflow, protesting outside nearly dangerous inside particular bar (people packed together, shitty airflow people screaming talk music whatever)

That said, pervasive violence police, particular POC, least worthy protest. tried quietly right, particular Trump, got bent shape ""sanctity"" Star Spangled Banner. Note people (poor/POC) much likely (and right protests) suffer effects coronavirus jobs worked remotely many healthcare. also due right. So, yeah, rightfully pissed went protest. blame.

Meanwhile Trump incited protest outrage CDCs recommendations, particular isolation resulting feedback loop him, right wing base, media, GOP governors people protesting for.....a haircut resulting mindless lifting restrictions....like bars. city LA might 4M meaningless number count entire connected urban area (there actually enclave separate cities inside city LA borders...it's weird). LA odd case unlike parts country core urban construction thins out, urbanized LA keeps going city county lines, driving through, looks like city hours.

The actual population connected urban area Los Angeles around 18.7 million: Yup bars neighborhood windows opened back that's exciting. couple restaurants even correct amount distancing tables   Or, know. *Not* live it. Totally, keeping postive attitude though. think take either. Though agree general idea keep real let doomerism unrealistic optimistism either.

I say build community that's doing, helping best can. One many ""questionable"" terminations/reassignments happened state federal level professional scientists, Health professionals, date reporters... follow ""party line"".

After all, experts going tell /s 240 million Americans vote him. think got north 60 million votes, less votes Hillary.

What system! Elon Musk shorted stock ago, anyone really suprised he'd this? actually know this

¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ least respectful don’t resort personal attacks like some. Stay FOX News comments. stuff dont fly real world. Yeah maybe right. Right like bandaid ripped off, uncomfortable painful maybe neccessary healing long run.

PS &lt;3 username 

Have nice day!   Notice going states people go INSIDE lot summer? virus like that, we'd already dead. It’s also bottles/caps impossible find. hoping community immunity, someplace 60 70 percent population needs COVID-19. population 328 million US, least 200 million would need COVID-19. 

The current number suspected cases US 25 million. least 175 million needed contract disease community immunity. It’s even close . Captain Tripp’s almost 100% contagious 100% fatal . neither . book society collapsed . stayed inside ordered take . worry guys, totally worth reopening state pretending virus exist. /s 3) always want us dispel notion Barack Obama know he's doing. worry rights! Masks dumb! like sheep research! mean got covid-19? get something fake? 


(Joke) Freedom tastes like! Meanwhile today, [Japanese student returning Taiwan tests positive Can't tell serious. 

Wait, serious? GODS PLAN Yeah, think availability tests huge issue. Basically one really knows reached every state many infections were. Ended locking everything down. leaders four months ago??  Honestly Trump it? seems like lot people close contact him. Natural selection finest. Darwin's theory, hey anti-maskers prescribe science worries. stated another way, forty-one 9/11s. remember big deal Covid-19 killed many people 9/11? I'm 90 years old 99.9999999999995% chance perfectly fine right? mean health authorities said March go scream everybody trying warn me? Funny everyone shits boomers look demographic wants stay open moody? Believe me, everyone 3rd world country like Philippines AC. AC not, hot humid winter, doesn’t matter.   would collective responsibility, wouldn’t it?

If someone stupid enough book holiday Florida anywhere matter, think cancel last minute feel unwell stepping plane?

Nope ""I've already paid it"", ""My family disappointed"", ""I can't get anymore time work"" , ""its cold"". close borders think spinning ball earth/ space theories indoctrinated bunch ridiculous bullshit. left job boss’s boss wouldn’t let wear mask back March would give customers bad impression. mandatory work per company policy. guy complete idiot.

EVERYONES GETTING PAID UNEMPLOYMENT NOTHING EASY MONEY Sounds right. I’ve despised governor long time pushes edge. should, honestly cant see happening. become touchpoint issue somehow. f'd Yeah doesn’t make sense. lot people need “younger” kids school day work, after-care cheaper day care. It’s safe, people work...it’s nightmare. Dam it. I'm IN.! They're tired, even try. Absolutely weak bloodlines dishonorable families. agree enough public Florida. People still support desantis trump Whataboutism, also known whataboutery, variant tu quoque logical fallacy attempts discredit opponent's position charging hypocrisy without directly refuting disproving argument. Whataboutism particularly associated Soviet Russian propaganda. Wikipedia

Logic: Logical fallacy

Tactic: Propaganda technique

Active period: Cold War–present loved Him, actively conspired murder Marco 'stopped clock' Rubio. Protesters? use Facebook? Twitter? Google? guess what...they already track location Yes...


I hope wrong, would horrible... &lt;3 like maybe 5 days full shut part 2? truly think comprehension things like extremely low. totally stealing that...  think Joplin think big ass tornado lord won’t buy Mercedes Benz add covid19 list reopened soon. help local law enforcements enforce anything, neither lot stores now. mention lot people packing literally public place ""quarantine finally over!!"" make even 200k? people can't math hurts much. Good news Mayor said masks required handing door. people ticked they're country think made anyway. Hooray good sense. take health CaN't tAkE fReEdUmB bad year. wonder mean many people got it? I'm sure, dont know numbers infected past season daily number new COVID-19 cases highest since height pandemic two months ago, reaching 34,700 Tuesday.

Well really height then, it? severe cases, mild cases. That's paper claimed, acting like lied it. common problem democracy (not I'm democracy), government often wittingly ignorant average voter. Considering 2-party system US, state government often ignorant average incumbent party voter. 

Many policies enforced voters board. is, shit happens reality settles in. Lol well guess God disagreed talking shit Homies mean, agree general sentiment support state-wide mask orders. also support carve legitimate concerns here. doesn’t say shouldn’t wear mask... says aren’t penalties choose fear (and it’s legitimate fear) wearing mask put danger. country half size one cities.... cool childfree\*

&amp;#x200B;

\*I know automatically cool saying this.

Seriously though, definitely glad time childfree sterilized (i.e. concerned access birth control/abortion needed). Especially got listen neighbours dealing kids lock day day (and even would call 'good kids' incredibly patient people).

&amp;#x200B;

I read article day difficulties women seeking abortion having, feel them. also women also difficulty exercising choices right now. highest today probably bad Trump, would try hardest be. Good , sister died may shithole state Same. Except productivity way due office antics. Sure makes sense send back home. paper claimed severe cases benefited, like hid that. paper even showed milder cases showed need extremely cautious initial studies, especially vaccines.

We already that. worlds brightest minds still taking every precaution necessary vaccine. like we're gonna blindly inject without sure safe possibly minimal severe side Oh need extra cautious perform studies.

Speaking scientist, that's one best parts science. replicate studies verification lot, that's especially medicine. That's happens FDA verifies drugs work, replicate study done researchers verify results. no, wear mask follow natural selection. y'all government bribe taking, money lobbying, greedy potatoes anyways. wear mask sake rest us die already. many racist grandpa's government. yet learned nothing. preparation. ppe. economy rest world going disconnect from. I'm sorry loss suffered, wish best luck coming months. believe (general you) infect someone else due wearing mask indoor place end dying, sent prison. concern perceived threatening could see taking like 20-30% sentence, don’t believe let it. number of coronavirus cases surges Florida, 7,000 people signed online petition urging Disney and government officials reconsider the opening Disney World next month. much disagree first guy preparing downvoted, historian made laugh pretty hard. best numbers mostly crematoriums 😳40k new cases last 24hrs USA damn,since april early june fluctuated 25-28k since till BLM protests dropped 18k-21k daily cases. worrying Yes, although realistically less since there's immunity already disease. seems like not-hard-hit places around 5% mark\*, harder hit places higher that. subtract numbers whatever needed herd immunity... although course, increase immunity going slow spread, amount help little bit.

\*haven't checked numbers feel free correct recent info... Can't spike test anybody Heck yeah, another state r/Masks4All great questions. feel like it’s smoke mirrors really. Everyone I’ve talked adamantly self quarantine anyway. country responsible covid sticking around longer needs to.  agents didn’t sign needlessly put harms way simple precautions could used. guess see, chart, 35 crowd won’t voting November... Jfc  Yea, experience it’s mostly bc care less, also poorer weren’t able afford good masks live denser areas. boyfriend hispanic family would rather DIE family gathering like every week lmao.  countries great. amazingly well. completely fuck response like US did, that's sure. Washington? Apparently...i dunno really random opportunities never usually present likely coupled cost travel decking well... normal anything. taken two solo friends vacations like five ten years ago... know really... advocate it, means tell anyone live life... especially never know tomorrow might bring it. Can't scared either... gotta feed economy. Crazy times. Fall gonna bad. fuck asking lol

I havent met single person wants lockdown fuck sOUtHeAsT sEaTtle Fun statistic. breathe CO2 wearing prevent sounds freedom. /s Mickey Morgue Marco Rubio idiot who’s saying something logical  Trump Administration nothing except tell us going away... point intentional neglect President lives American citizens sworn protect become crime humanity? That’s crock shit sure cannot find information soon coming contact Covid positive individual would become contagious yourself? find soon show symptoms contagious others. makes medical system inaccessible unless absolutely necessary - traps essential (expendable) jobs… data using? covidracking still showing dropping. wrote short sci fi story manufactured virus gets ""peeled"" new infection. layered get reproduces like viruses except comes back form 2 take another crack immune system. next form recognizes work last form. learns.

This cool sounding hook made story based theory suddenly evolutionary changes caused viruses. virus already battle tested organism. cases inserts DNA stays acts like new gene.

I always like use analogy car old carbuerator intake manifold. virus comes along something body tries use gene. could something simple like switching 2 barrel 4 barrel complex like carbuerated fuel injection. animal world lungs instead gills flippers strong enough walk on.

This virus may edit feature means could go quiet come back vengeance. Yeah protests going week bible photo op. Also BLM approval rating nearly 80% positive compared prediction grim realities lol onus you, me. side claims scientific. *quickly grabs drinks bottle water*  need still wear mask one? Seems like could still spread others vaccine.  True. could always point XXXX say came much better them. 

It's election year I'm current government done good job far. Nearly 50 thousand cases 30 deaths. Considering 90% cases foreign workers, locals seem bothered. govt pretty much shoved money whoever needs it. course, we're scheduled vote 2 weeks time. Wonder who's gonna win round.... I’m sure would keep getting free money, 60% US population median income. ambition, drive. bunch welfare hags!  I’m sure fucking up. think may playing smart game. Ohio’s numbers getting worse last 3 days.

He built lot credibility. couldn’t keep things shut well.

But think ability shut things needed.

Hell still contact trace Ohio. named zip codes increase happened.

Abbott Santa’s jus shitting pants. put another way, 80% population become infected, 0 died, true IFR would 0.28%, higher 0.26%. Or, again, 0.58% Bergamo. know explain clearly.  Lol people actually poll? average working class Americans bills pay. Exactly. ever moment ""Stamp name"" huckstering, would masks. Instead get worst timeline. People understand basic germ theory germs work, make food serve drinks go out. parents. Etc etc etc. truth that. seems hypocrisy many people claim adamant social distancing stopping coronavirus protesting supporting protests. Sure, fight racism, discourage public protests could potentially spread virus much quicker especially higher risk minorities like black people. People make sense sometimes. Along lines barely winning state 4 years ago(and how/why, area flipping part that), even D, still R state...so dealing large amount people think put wearing masks fact job year, lead delay mask orders. God, please, send asteroid much rest world already beaten this. longer global pandemic. It’s American pandemic, bolstered incapable leaders country full people don’t care. Something needs change get this. What’s long term effect covid ? Good job protesters. 100k protesters bunched together pandemic. could go Except part people working, majority people still working even reduced hours. still many places need be. Restaurants, electronics stores, clothing stores, working offices work home, theme parks x etc Visitors banned since mid-March. spread happening reasons: staff, transfers prisons, normal intake/releases. Exactly, states like Texas, Arizona, (probably) Florida seem point return. Good you! true definition person knows means make America great! idea improving country instead ruining like people want do. support cause, tactics. hope safe taking precautions prevent spread. I’m going MB month, slightly unnerving live Texas, city people pretty good masks, 90% people see masks on, However, many people still going gathering really be, recently drove beaches witnessed groups hundreds people set tents close quarters partying single person hundreds mask on, city masks rarity would estimate less 5% people wearing masks areas drove by, lot people gathering be, even city. seems like lot people forgotten it. balanced society requires economic stability, strong social fabric, well healthy rumoring health. seems big imbalance overemphasizing physical health virus mental health, social fabric society, economy.

A good example nation that's everything think necessary Brazil. Right situation nothing short dystopian. SWEAR STOP HEART grossly sickening fact people early across nation, would 120k dead economy shambles. much winning, please mr president, we're tired winning  think 5500 cases day gonna end up? lot people got pregnant 9 months too. Hello Orange County. I’m sorry live sometimes. post deliberately targeting demographic site majority demographic So, obviously someone wear mask out. that? really want understand reason. bed ICU bed.

It's not. Anyone buys tech nazi piece shit disowned. aren’t leaders, poor managers.
They idea takes actually lead.
Only manage others, albeit poorly. No, need get point somebody go. That's everyone-for-themselves mindset. kinds precautions, health care stimulus packages ensure citizens die economy. Politicians looking citizens, stock portfolios. Bezos parents invested 250k company. missed point entirely. air conditioned spaces, existing cooler air recycled small amount 'new air'. means area essentially ventilated all. Mate, eat cake.for breakfast Wow 90k/yr would definitely go since there's like 34k/yr jobs here. agree general, life saving is, definition essential, elective. generally hospital /surgeon decides elective.

So grandma going wait little longer hip replacement. grandpa still get pacemaker replaced... now. Bye, Oklahoma. example made. Enforce mandate one. Yes, making tough decisions cowardly pathetic.   posting show talk colleague saying. felt point lost original post...

you're absolutely correct articles scientifically substantiated.

it's difficult lot people understand what's going minute. world leaders undermining science political gain. disinformation media online. 

unless lucky enough good education science fully understand peoples questioning whats going on... especially 24hr news/internet era live.  death rates going climb hard. gonna pretty absolutely want refuse wear mask use alternative shopping instacart etc. also suspect large population refuses wear mask, stores try enforce rules afraid losing customers second wave? Nah, it/s Obama's fault. Buck Stops  bar amounts generally well pin threshold?

In US likely _never_ use PIN, credit cards generally use one here. (even chip cards chip sign..)

Debit cards _can_ use them, people run charge instead debit done signature. exception ATM want cash back, usually.

But sign anything like $20, 2-5 drinks depending are, generally provided pen sign name.  /r/CultureShipNames I'm sure things opening nothing this. wrong say that, don’t fault getting pregnant. Pregnancy easy time think. Fertility challenges real trying, happens happens. many factors influence couple begin trying, waiting till end thing may option.  Hahaha definitely feel you. news broke idea meant. doc came laid thought 'Fuckin' sounds like solid, robust number' understand could’ve avoided. TMC leaders part problem shouldn’t throwing stones. work one TMC healthcare organization weeks President sided governor stating plenty supplies beds available. says would increase patients manageable. 
Since last week l, change tone says take precautions one could predicted this. stupid know what’s going happen reopen businesses? doesn’t want admit participation mess. Whatever is, still sides governor won’t reduce spread fear losing revenue. Multiple countries reduced overall risk population transportation 1/5 1/10 US. Congratulations picking yet another example shows American’s incompetence keeping rest developed world socially. Yeah, beginning young people straight got turned away testing ""at risk"". physical health? makes assume made up? can't speak others here, I've definitely conversations mirrored last three months, feel like lot people too. hardly r/thathappened material. little evidence outdoor spread, I'm sure makes sense. I'm sure. `TMC leaders` `CEOs`? What's ""we"" stuff? also stupid understand hyperbole means? Houston less 161 ICU beds available, 1266 Ventilators..

 think problem staff manage them...

Edit: Read case somebody's hose came lose died, nobody noticed stretched thin staff monitor.

DoubleEdit: I've NICU times.. CONSTANT alarms heart beat oxygen low, etc... can't imaging trying monitor alarms full ward Covid patients ventilators. Phoenix here. Stay safe friend. understand that, stupid. twins supposed start kindergarten month half. wife work full time 3 year old well. Things already insane August going impossible. Sigh  Who’s gonna enforce? police? Don’t enough plate? would public feel cops paid OT generate revenue states / country people? social distancing mask wearing look like last year? Nothing even close 2020.

There zero social distancing 2019 flu season zero use masks. There's question slow flu spread winter. Featuring special guest Darwin Lol like matters. boss calling back work. showing number tests performed per every confirmed case.

New Zealand U.S. actually rank close number tests performed per capita, New Zealand astronomically lower infection death rate.

It’s testing. get non cnn link fox morons Yep. bad people couldn’t dragging even longer...  It’s main liturgical service Catholic Church. know able sensor victims' families, doctors, nurses. going fact bad, we'll get idea whistle-blowers. Why? I've four testing facilities South Florida seen two people time. Trump said one person 18 died schools open back up. dont think understands infect older people. least take comfort knowing John Cena safe even Coronavirus can’t see him. temporary hospitals set April never got used, cases low shut things down. Hopefully bring back say, “you want vaccination, get vaccination “. Lol person enforce this? That’s meaningful question. seems effective way enforce mask mandates hold businesses accountable customer refuses. customer let in, thrown refusing. idea would work dine-in restaurants. Public buildings need human (security/staff/secretary/whatever) directly asking people keep masks whenever possible. Signs overhead announcements clearly working. 

This isn’t ideal. Ideally, told right thing, want it. Botched messaging lack federal leadership doomed beginning. That's good hear. Lol, main reasons want go:
 - Worried stupid thing pandemic
 - want make drive
 - really value space want live suitcase week  Last time checked, estimates page included data month March. absolutely undercounting cases deaths time. wouldn’t say reopening bad done properly, not. emphasizing importance masks, starting Phase 1 weeks early, rushing Phase 2 2 weeks mistakes ton states, especially South made. Imo, Texas, Arizona, others waited Memorial Day, proper testing, tracing, mask infrastructure place, would far better. Good advice. hadn’t supported leadership without common sense. it, though? Like, really insane? People die time, much greater numbers. happens, always will. goal never stop people getting sick dying, goal stop happening once. idea many people Texas it, little idea many died. mountains there. Won’t wear masks, they‘re cool silly hats.  think knows he’s going lose, he’s trying kill many us it’s him. mean, definitely sounds like Oregon Yes blatant lying isn’t gunna fool me. agree. Nobodies laid off. Texas here. wife one curbside ultrasound (really) one real ultrasound, saw tech OB called us later get results. allowed inside either. Sorry know meant ICU beds. word correctly. another note realize normal conditions ICU beds 70% occupancy. Younger people wear masks get old immunocompromised people sick. Looks like researching...if researched little bit more, would know asymptomatic people spread virus too. respect fellow Americans, would wear masks. Justaflutards sweating profusely corner.  I’m American I’m still interested know... why? least tried provide explanation funds allocated instead? CrossFit! Metcon Amrap Box Thrusters Burpies CrossFit!  don’t stomach now, push overwhelmed hospital territory, economy gonna crash. REALLY worst worlds. really don’t think it’s matter whether people want shut not. saw China Italy, it’s inevitable. Anything else magical thinking. seem ignoring breakdown costs indicating lack luxury salary coasts. seem determined believe preconceived notions regarding constitutes luxurious standard living assume amount money buys things regardless location. urge educate issue instead insulting repeating points. Source?  Cool! make hospital safe good idea right now. 3 weeks ago spiking running ICU beds. allowed elective surgery, go wild. Take risk want, say more? That's good, stop acting like know better. Nope surprised I’m essential healthcare worker treats 30 cancer patients day immunocompromised. I’m given disposable paper mask make last two days time. come home newborn hotspot Houston. Y’all idea anxiety feel everyday ): sounds like good news. I’m curious flu different every year vaccines always effective. guess flu broad covers strains? *Mark Rubio banned /r/conservative* Wow 66% approval rating, think ever see United States again.  I'm guessing tested everyone number would 3-5 times high memorial day, protest spikes start week. Yeah shit, paid lot CC debt, ... it’s gonna go back again, cuz full-time career probably 2022-2023. test anyone, 0 cases.

NZ currently following logic trump used, oh symptons, sweet lets test way see coming LMAO, Wait meteor 2027 ..

When start electing leaders degrees math science day humanity changes grandmothers grandfathers people spread going die agony got worst possible way.

People crowded bar least responsible get virus pass elder relatives/friends. Let’s see. Life-critical services like food emergencies. So, let’s simplify say that’s grocery stores/pharmacies hospitals. 

When places run things (like, say, everyone goes batshit insane panic-hoarding hypothetical 4-6 weeks stores stripped hours), groceries supplies come from? delivers them? supplies fuel trucks? operates stocks warehouses? runs factories produce food, brings raw materials them? runs power plants city water systems sewer departments keep going? services utilities facilities critical piece equipment breaks needs repair replacement keep lights water running?

This notion so-called “hard” lockdown 4-6 weeks fantasy. There’s many moving parts society attempt it. even government foolhardy attempt impossible task, resulting riots would put whatever we’ve seen last two months distant shame. It’s realistic. Well, I've contracted then, I'll see them. thing that's simultaneously hysterical infuriating people draw line. Masks? fucking serious? piece cloth mouth. Grow fuck part slow spread. I! look up. actually good way reach age 65!!! So, actually they're good nearly 50 years! Though, need send new photo every 12 years. Amazing! I’m boat. Got pregnant December, due beginning September, time fall weather perhaps make things worse! 

The number patients hospital OB appointments pull mask nose staggering. 

The amount cases area depends two things. 1) dense population 2) dense population is. I’ve lost faith community. 

I hope hang there! it, Reddit! Enlighten me. Prove wrong. feel you, initial reaction re-reading one gets me. breathing bacteria breathed gets sick, means already sick, know yet. This^ saw Canada two beef packing plants severe outbreaks resulting deaths closures. two plants supply 80% beef. MacDonalds Wendy's source us beef prices/selection effected flu leave people damaged life cases? ask I’ve never heard flu causing lung vascular damage. I’ve heard COVID though. media played profit margins. like last election.  truly care power, long drives clicks. Even extreme pessimist doesnt expect happen doubt caught night before. probably contagious went spread around. car dealership today. Two buildings. One entry level car brand luxury brand. entry level building, everyone wearing masks. Receptionist, sales people, customers, everyone.

I went luxury brand building one wearing masks. Except finance manager, single person wearing mask. Three piece suits hottest day year? Sure. mask much.

It like visiting two different planets. city government voted 5-4 mandating masks. disappointed surprised. FREEEEEEDDUUUMMBBBB! seriously think covid deadly AIDS b/c that's insanely stupid. Ah yes, reliable community online. Aye got vote 🥴   missing IQ points, that's sure. people think 10 Million next 7 days HIGH estimate lol. would make great representative state United States Congress Relax... extended. They'd rather country break anarchy.. atleast think so.. honestly seems like everyone wanted go away. think everyone far path Trump, believe charge want cause fuss hoped bare minimum would disappear. Well surprise surprise, going anywhere. stupid. Regardless *lie* *reckless*  afraid protests effective might see bump crime. (as people imagine police afraid enforce right now, encourage take advantage.) 

Never wildest dream expect crime trotting around public without mask. Trying Conceive Heres TMC (Houston Medical Center) ICU bed count/graph 6/24,  So, 180,000 people definitely die October first saying.  need installer, basically installing router inside trailer wireless radio outside trailler connecting piece ethernet cable. mind numbingly simple work half way complete idiot. 

if something handle figure paperwork, I'll sign dotted line even give room stay months get situated. get sick every time get flu shot. Still better lying bed semi-conscious two days real flu. Thank you. Sorry rough time. Good luck new job safe. Things better vaccine gets here, fingers crossed. Whenever see someone say ""this reminder vote"" want shake lapels scream faces. reminder hold national strike block roads government takes deadly pandemic seriously, wait January 2021 People town LAUGH react Emergency Committee’s posts fb daily new cases. high 21 Monday (small town) someone commented, “Stop Fear mongering!!” 🤦🏻‍♀️ start? Wear masks. Wash/sanitize hands. Social distance.  Unfortunately need think bit deeper that. hospitalized mean ""mild"" infection. means accepted hospital, sat home pneumonia systemic infection. people would hospitalized ten times normal situation.

Data disease severity STILL based data China January, completely misleading incorrect. need update that. 97% Capacity opening everything... holy shit America bumpy ass 6 months stay home wear damn mask.... NY? would also know caught recovered. would treat like superpower. like says “allowed” people work. Forced. force people work fire them. I’m pretty sure weren’t begging come fucking corona virus. “Allowed” ass. system sucks. make statements extent aymptomatic/presymptomatic transmission known? Context important. Studies suggest is. It’s blood disease well may never leave body go boo.  Prickly pear nectar sweet - makes good agave substitute margaritas. Take note that, cactus fruits season soon. Pretty sure bad... although protesters young mostly masked.. trump rallies old fat people masks.. bad equally so. seem spread virus activities happen millions every day. outlier case tho. Teenagers even comorbidities much less risk virus broken clock right twice day. sources. Indoor worse hell lot people outside protesting rally Wait - people 45-55?? Herbert Mountain Dew Comacho president y'all. Hoax Chyna! Everyone,

Thank you, FatAndGayRetard Extend shit im actually making progress student loans Ask Big Horn Jesus Salvation follow single law driving isn’t lmao. take longer COVID hit developing countries, like Brazil? SOb trying blame China everything damn time. It’s easy forget we’re getting started. takes somewhere around 70% infected reach herd immunity one long ride. know talk vaccine, faith it’s gonna come quick. Even make enough go around. point doubt US find first. seem barely functional. Wear masks. Wash hands 20 seconds. Tell everyone know wear masks. this. It’s hard. know give permission, press MUST cover bodies leaving hospital bodies stacking morgue. may morbid, doubters need concrete proof. press government must take juggernaut staunch doubters see themselves. 

Because somehow idiots understand care 100K dead Americans responsibility others American. like take civilian Germans Nazi Death Camps get thick skulls horror happened watch. horror upon us idiots wear MASK wash hands fight it. jaw-dropping. 

 
There needs daily instruction speaking causes spray droplets fly air infect another person wearing mask. 

Wearing mask helps me. I'm high risk group due multiple autoimmune diseases. offer hearty thank comply. 

Wear Mask 

&amp; 

Carry On. less re-opening failure follow LA County health guidelines mask use social distancing. 

I disappointed things closed people following guidelines lesson - although punishes businesses compliance out. 

It also seems like biggest issue opening, people deciding socialize. biggest spreader events birthday parties...because people wearing masks distancing! people seem realize Disney World closed doors first time state shut down. DW beck call Florida Orlando; feel need close, they'll likely point. Although, Necessary. 

Some people need broken others! Put problem perspective, promote calm balanced conversations actual threat level facing. Florida underwater figure one out. *the know* 🌈🌈 39,103

Fucking *hell*. wasted everything. Swing voters base. you’re *still* undecided, you’re exactly he’s trying appeal Polio terrible, spread like this. yellow fever pandemic 1793. Pretty sure one still alive. said ""pandemic serious"". Spanish Flu. thought cases would really start going last month, wrong. Yes. That’s goes. might concern trolling TwO wEeKs-ing, that’s went New York. Nothing changed. Oh great. set then. Go party BTW, Amazon Prime 24 episodes ""The Great Courses"" series Black Death. Free 6/30 Sounds like good choice move R N C Florida. people supposed indulge ChiChis goodness sake?! don’t think it’s anything. don’t claim know is. think it’s something...a spinning ball magically holding water level motionless flies wildly space. believe whole fascinating. us brain heads never left. Yep, could drop dead aneurysm right now. understand think clever pointing everyone takes calculated risk dying simply act alive, none taking measures stop preventable, contagious, exponential growing virus. Saying hundreds thousands people dying preventable disease big deal ""everything calculated risk dying"" sociopathic. Fortunately live country whose citizens care, death toll low comparison. know website called Google? know search articles / studies Google? so, that. find many scientists, scientific evidence, masks help reduce spread. already common sense you, guess people common sense. Yes, America remembered sole winner COVID war. USA, USA, US.. cough cough won’t be. governor California shut Disneyland down. DeSantis would NEVER. thought summer going happier time, much guess. I’ll research real quick H1N1.

Is true bc keeps mutating? feeling we’ll never even know catch it. questions I'll getting around kids, followed askers acting offended say I'm interested, stopped least! Yep, could’ve sold loser participation trophy masks (or confederate battle flag) MAGA masks. wouldn’t thrilled seeing everywhere go public, beats seeing people wearing mask all. actually used often think. know fact hospitals right Harvey due amount people died. Granted number nothing compared COVID, felt like saying hospitals used point. Damn. country 100k people NY 1% positives days. Yep. place. go beyond. I'm super serious it. almost nobody else is.

When brought back work, 2 different meetings training session telling us changes new protocols rules covid defence. Telling us serious it.

Well big joke nobody right. none managers HR cares. “The thing drives bad information good information!”

So work. know what's next. Censorship? I've become completely nocturnal go walking/jogging night. pretty nice calm quiet everything late hours. 😜 It’s personal narrative, news story piece scientific research. don’t want read it, don’t, y’all ones melodramatic here. Personally enjoy getting details people’s experiences navigating shitty US healthcare system find informative. can't find original models time assume correct I'm mis-remembering reports saw can't prove otherwise. I've following since January heavily since early February remember huge discrepancy models limited information. 

My point say we're well (the fact we're worse last month's IHME worst case scenario pointed shows that), say greater statistical significance compare countries directly performance rather models, particularly given see provided article models judged know large variance numbers. wasn’t Disney’s doing, California forced hand refusing discuss approving reopening. lot people comments giving Disney credit, opened hotels Disney World still full steam ahead opening Florida. Disneyland opening State California unions, Disney wanted delay I'm grateful live Canada I've unable work 3 month (laid daycare means can't go back work), still get minimum wage (or that) paid government every week. hit paywall one. anybody paste text? Make covid great again! Hey now, Brazil broke 40k cases today. America get solid #1 position letting foreign countries like that! /s Oddly past tense sure want PoC expose others marginalized communities COVID-19 pandemic rapidly spiraling control- don’t think you’re right side this.  go back time 1955 fix this?  Well so... one could foreseen this! type stupidity I'm referring to

Can English? effect children's psyche

I've already seen happen. mask, adults acting, plus media. I've seen three kids nervous breakdowns directly related mask wearing. I've Japan 25 years, I've seen evolution mask wearing foreigner society. I'll break you. animals, get 30% information like animals mask hides. Put one every animal interact expect animals problems. That's all. something even eventually understand. Mental illness manifests fun ways, like becoming hikikomori, bullying, hoarding, consumption, drug addiction, calling people stupid. Every person attended rally, given quarantine order exited facility.  Including, federal agents officials. 35% Americans idiots lack empathy. isn’t putting people mood spend money, live, fear paranoia disease far disproportionate threat compared threats face accept daily

what going do, force people spend money? oops, sorry, see China number title, muscle memory makes reply like immediately.

don't ask read whole title, I'm dumb anyone read article missing something?? seem closing sites funding testing established mechanism effort expand testing. Unless I’m reading completely wrong, story misleading Giroir, assistant HHS secretary health, said statement: “The federal government ending funding support COVID-19 testing sites. contrary, expanded original 41 sites 600 48 states District Columbia federal bundled payment program pharmacies, enabled 1400 additional pharmacy sites regulatory flexibility empowering pharmacists facilitating billing reimbursement."" Tell Shell station went Harris Teeter that. one enforcing this! fuck gonna go Florida now? Absolute numbers deaths case fatality rate death rate hospital admissions or...?

Like there's lots ways measure things tell story. Like absolute number deaths might lag diagnosis death. case fatality rate go testing people mild/no symptoms previously might tested people serious symptoms known exposures whatever. death rate hospital admissions affected also admitted, again, lots free beds, hospitals likely accept marginal cases. beds, hospitals get choosy accept.

Naturally, might also improved treatment methods. Probably something like ICU admission death rate could shed light that.

What know cases get point overwhelms health system see spike death rate people could treated able treated can't treated well otherwise might. also get extremes, healthcare worker infections compounds problem delivering healthcare.

No one number going tell whole story. Yes, Martians War Worlds. bet 65% respondents unemployment making extra $600 week. IMO 180k September 1st. sooner. I'm boat little bit scary. loving spending time 6 month old, anxiety producing knowing job market shake out. know email comes from.
For part Texas Medical Center prepping months us work get emails almost daily keep us date. They've done pretty good job informative severity fear mongering. usa spends money european military need us threat enemies. usa would stop funding european armies would drop free health care would drop great portion army interseted war usa.  going get interesting see happens states make masks mandatory see much lower rates versus states lassie faire masks wearing. already see New York trying impose quarantines people coining state CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT USE CURBSIDE PICKUP Ada County cases, though rolled backwards stage 3 today, bars close again. know Fox hates reporting this. 🤣 give racists much credit. 2 weeks huh 🤔 Yeah back normal Repeat me: mask ventilator.  Yeah, like black plague... RIP US citizens I'd say numbers likely accurate anymore. Early pandemic, doctors idea treat this. lot people still dying, likely new treatments drop death rate further, no?  Yeah, maybe single word represent that. word possibly use? Serfs? S.....ervants! people technically choice...hmmnn. follow CDC telling him. Easy. Couldn’t follow through. Lol that’s joke. It’s whatever think is, how’s that? Two things. 

One, one good idea IFR pandemic run course. Best estimates anywhere 0.5% 1.5%.

Aren’t churches hundreds regularly referred super spreading events? What’s make idiocy? Super ~~MAGA~~ Mega Super Spreading Event? Thank friend pancake sheet cake fry top butter syrup... trying say baking would make less healthy? go Indiana. fact want. looked IMHE site- could someone explain predicting huge rise Florida cases thru end August, plunge cases Septembe Florida gets crowded again, schools reopen? Seems bizarre. rest country show that. Could projecting things get bad go back total idea many people facebook list unfriended posting covid news march going ""it's flu"" ""we stop"" ""i eat chinese restaurants show you"" know posting messages like ""i've always told you! wear mask! stay safe"".  

once there's one call people pretend never deniers. So, supposed information doesn’t involve I’m already prevent getting COVID-19? last question interview, CNN lady seemed figure issue Jones totally grasp question failed answer it. Seems like non-issue far. We'll see gets worse. least protests now.. med student would never making independent decisions, glorified information collectors (source: went med school).

[Or something something Texas Medical Center one hospital one giant groups different locations? Could backlog old deaths. Quite countries done time time Rich guys throw away people time every day. 2m additional deaths. Though fair, awful people drivers may well offset deaths some. Covid Saves! That’s I’m saying, it’s people like add literally nothing conversations like this. didn’t get protests. Read above. Super shitty headline. “It’s easier beg forgiveness ask permission” may work case. 60% time, works every time Disney copyright breaking? There’s litany “magical” websites selling “flying state Georgia” “Spooky large house” scented candles. Uncle Sam opened fire tanks peaceful protesters June 4th, 1989, killing least several hundreds. Uncle Sam currently rounding practicing Muslims putting special camps break culture. /s Wrong again. literally intro:

""Among patients discharged died (n = 2634), 14.2% treated intensive care unit, 12.2% received invasive mechanical ventilation, 3.2% treated kidney replacement therapy, 21% died""

Among resolved cases, 21% died. much trouble understanding something basic? Lost there, buddy. somehow went criminal last fucked comment. really need help.
