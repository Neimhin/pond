Thee AZ vaccine's reputation already zero. 
If true two people got serious, even deadly, side effects batch, game over. skepticism longer effectiveness, health risks. Merkel disaster Germany, full stope Good question. don’t know I’m commenting remember check back later!  Stupid lockdown lights place enforcement?  point that, least Germany, vaccinations happening snails pace.

We need digital passports yet. UK.

40% drop deaths coinciding 41% adults vaccinated perfectly frank - think anti-vaxxers don’t deserve vaccine shouldn’t get it. efficacy high enough don’t NEED everyone get vaccinated. know it’s implementable. sayin rubs wrong way morons, actively preventing world dealing virus, end get benefits living modern civilization. don’t really belong. actively harm it. don’t deserve fruits. felt same, heard got PPP money. \*willfully ignorant

&amp;#x200B;

:( meant money going foreign businesses Agreed. That's need open all. complete crap immune comprimised can't get shot yet. But, encourage try. really going deny shot there? Hell no. Based information article, simply don’t understand justification continued restaurant restrictions. We’ve destroyed restaurant industry almost gain all. Free- dumb never lies, historians historical fact every pandemic 20th Century ended people stop scared it.

Absolute gems comments, thank you. Temper tantrum having, wishing-to-kill-others-with-their-actions babies. (Or, least, not-giving-a-fuck-if-they-kill-others-with-their-actions babies.)  


Every single one them. government(s) mostly focused cheap, yet effective, passive measures: Lockdowns, shutdowns, closures, financial aid. Active measures like testing, tracing, vaccinating abysmal. 

So truth points view. Germany far failure, loses lot ground active measures available. Serious question I’m snarking...why senior living facilities need covid relief? Brazil set create vaccine-resistant variant virus (slow vaccination, poor use masks social distancing). home work still ZERO new cases since first round vaccines beginning January. residents staff doses. Fingers crossed keeps up!! past year - pandemic?

And worse new York California. Sorry, crossed wires talking AZ Pfizer manufacturing earlier year. EMA pressing ahead assessment Sputnik, grumbling EC. Yeah seem like many people get airborne viruses spread?  continues surprise UK could mess initial response locking prevention much island nation initial vaccine rollout going way WAY faster could predicted, France Germany, loudest critics absolutely ballsed probably important step.

It matter way look it, France Germany dropped ball spectacular fashion. People sorts jobs tend live long Where's data effectiveness seems zero correlation rate infection lockdown measures 

Why can't people rational covid like Trump trump highjacks everyone's critical thinking skills 

Why california better Florida?? Nobody answers Click bait number infections, hospitalizations deaths stabilized. That’s take. good 2,000 deaths day US. Since early January seen steady declines, minus one small bump easily explained snow north east &amp; mid Atlantic, severe cold weather Texas.

No one really thought would see rate declines saw almost two months, would zero cases right case. Look way much known flu virus long traditional flu shots around vs mRNA vaccines SARS Cov 2? good point think it, hate shit feel awkward putting back on. Wish anti-maskers would show that. see ton comments low-quality information allowed posted, ok. Sure. Bulgaria

Did even buy Pfizer? question new vaccines wondering somebody knew answer to. vaccines, cells produce spike protein bodies, cells used destroyed cleaned immune system, similar normally infected cell? moderna. First dose pretty much side effects sore arm (which don’t really even count side effect) felt little cold night might cold haha.

Second dose woke 14 hours moderate headache. 16 hour mark felt like worked first time long time day topped moderate hangover. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.

WTH?!

Bidens promise win georgia get people 2000 dollar checks, 1400 dollar checks, stop shilling democrats man. Ok people.. you’re republicans vote this.. vote out.. people.. think problem word “finds”. course makes sense course already knew, study gather hard data verify hypothesis. 

That’s science works. still months see effect vaccination. Time soon(tm) tell right. I'll let know things went, ma'am. promise that. highlight many times subreddit AZ worse Pfizer I'd rather Pfizer agree ""all vaccines equally great"" ""all care hospitalizations deaths"" propaganda. think vaccines work, work others, data AZ worse mRNA vaccines. still hold roughly opinion today (although positive data AZ coming lately, think difference large thought beginning).

This mean agree Macron's ""quasi ineffective"" statement. never defended statement, based real data clearly blunder. average rent Manhattan $3,475 ...in 2019 ppl arguing public schools US funded research know they’re full shit?

/s I'll put wish list. 

Fingers cross. 85% presumably frontline workers still wearing masks. wearing masks, relative effectiveness combined treatments would likely significantly lower. (I.e. masks reduce risks 50%, vaccine+no mask might give 60% reduced chance catching virus vs 85% vaccine+mask. Aside strains months...what’s rationale this? Rate change slowed trend appears turning again. print card online... That's American mindset right there, existed well covid times wrong you? think hid dead bodies, Florida large controversy data reporting. 

So impossible pressure report deaths pneumonia alone, I'd curious significant spike causes excess deaths per capita. did, I'd leary data.

But even spent next week showing Florida California comparison bad whatever reason, found valid shows Florida's response amazing, matter. People change mind often, especially year pandemic.

Wtf, get line soon I’m last year? fair, pretty terrible deal, huge amount fat added. implying since indoor dining open AZ surprising passed law. point make sense indoor dining open every state Good. around 47k cases reported today, based last week quickly cases seem going down. Lets hope less 47k Went birthday party niece's 10th birthday last night. Everyone except 1 person vaccinated, weirdly normal experience. Ended staying sister's house till 10 pm, *way* later usual family event goes, think excited socialize.

1 year day 9th birthday party, bit awkward Coronavirus news isolated 6' away everyone else work NYC hospital (but masks otherwise social distancing except partner I) CDC researchers looked U.S. counties placed state-issued mask mandates counties allowed restaurant dining — indoors tables outside. study looked data March December last year. reductions growth rates varied half percentage point nearly 2 percentage points. may sound small, **large number people involved means impact grows time, experts said.**

Can someone explain math hypothetical number people? sounds really small given massive economic impact world works first world countries using third world countries guinea pigs vaccine putting last line everything works fine. mean NJ one strict states mostly back hybrid system back full time fall. top feds pushing even strict states get back school voice reason. Went get Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine last night NYC. Got screening ultimately said CDC put new guidance (must've around midnight EST) anyone history anaphylaxis anything (not medicine vaccine ingredients) allowed get shot unless administered hospital.

I food allergies turned away without getting shot. Anyone hear anything similar this? Pretty disappointed. Imagine isolated risk instead shutting everything else down. hugely misleading. reason deaths reported today delay caused technical issues.

The actual death figures released later today hopefully getting closer double figures, nowhere near 0 yet. alone feeling: understood that, trying dumb way explain, know saturation point variants lower COVID-19 OG. know conditions ripe variants disseminate become public health crisis. tell growth rate, going take reach overtake even current COVID-levels already low.

This brings point. takes variant one month reach sub COVID OG, would take another month two get crisis level, there's much worried, vaccination surges ahead millions millions people. broth thin. You’re right. thought didn’t qualify anything. mistake even scandal Britain

It still keeps getting brought British idiot. area working home rotating come offices. One time came cubicles ones working. Later day called everyone saying exposed someone covid need get checked. Wish could say happened her. She’s like COVID doesn’t exist. uk, Sunday numbers always lower system. something take account. Man, high horse calling others critical reader, sure buy reporter’s view Covid let inform world view 😂 in-line outcomes vaccine orders include many orders CureVac (German/Dutch) also yet delivered

I think argument French ""allowed"" *more* German/American vaccines would disproportionally favor Germany/disfavor France, i.e. ok ordering many German French vaccines.

But say infamous ""anonymous sources"" anyways. OK youre telling cool vaccine questionable efficacy data corrupt despicable family country, fled Spain amid gnarly scandals, qualify getting vaccine yet still got ""offered"" got vaccinated Abu Dhabi? bungled start compare us East Asia. 
We always excuse orange julius bojo even worse job. excuse gone people see trapped months sheer arrogance leaders. Misleading. UK government's [official Covid summary processing issues deaths England, numbers deaths throughout UK updated later. meantime, number newly reported deaths 7 March 2021 may incorrectly show zero.

There deaths report today, due technical issue published later today. Yeah, also used guinea pigs. Thousents brazilian volunteered vaccine testing, got back? Last place line.

Yes, also president fault, fuck? Missouri still mess. People st. Louis getting offers schedule appointments hours away. 40% state population lives vaccine desert. 3% small effect least 80% population isn’t dining restaurants? went grocery store visited parents. Walked door said jokingly, “You guys don’t weird flu going around, ya?” really thought would blow weeks. dad said, “Not yet. Probably won’t gone get vaccine.” thought nuts. Pops right yet again. I’m sure it’s easy see word “Austin” knee jerk liberal. CBS Austin owned Sinclair broadcasting. conservative leaning organization. Yeah shows lot cares church son, imo. Especially lot cases churches dont need money, get tons support places dont pay taxes. mention people running church likely get stimulus themselves, doubt going care put towards church. all, spend money plenty blind followers pay checks you? Lmaoooooo you’re conceding CNN fact fearmonger, that’s main point article, it’s fine?

Sounds good. We’re done I’m expert maybe I’m wrong beleive mRNA recycled nucleotides cells repurposed body. Similarly body normal mRNA. I’m really sure mechanism happens. Probably enzyme proteins combination this. interaction many staff worked later symptoms, never caught it. one tested positive December 30th possibly get staff member close proximity 30 minutes so; however, spread others. Fortunately, light case medications keep heavy symptoms bay. patients much contact staff congregate care facility. use telemedicine much possible, chemo patients left chemo treatments, etc. can't, got it. I'm sorry, simply wrong. another A+ appearance Scott Gottlieb Face Nation. 

Always look forward Sunday interviews. health departments issue mask mandates. law strangles says regulations non-binding. law like important future blue areas refuse lift mask mandates. I’m sure right though.... want to. do. will. Everyone else stay home quake fear. since beginning. 50-60% still working vaccine Wow - log Clubhouse now! can't wait! :) CA, inmates without pre-existing conditions top list confined space. isn’t news. lies crux problem!!

phase 3 vaccines safe offered one pandemic really really extremely awesome. arguing this. all. sound like poorly educated doctors area. must population wide thing. dont know fix education system America really need clamp travel ban. logarithmic growth would look something like

Today = Yesterday\^(R) \[cases\]

Solving R

R = log(today) - log(Yesterday) \[log cases\] 
R% = log(today) - log(Yesterday) times 100 \[%\] According Smithsonian, CDC, sources, EVIDENCE vaccine produces mucosal immunity thus still infectious people standing around ""vaccinated"" individual. matter enough time figure out. already done first year study.

Furthermore, matter time like alluded to, make feel better. Simply put, like telling someone, ""take vaccine. 'think' 'may' prevent transmission virus others need time figure out. solid data, go ahead take it.""

Which sense happened vaccine general. Yes, went safety protocol however, enough time yet determine EXACTLY safe dangerous may yet be. IDEA 5 years road say, people start developing strange cancer something. possible. trust big pharma companies far throw them. all.. convicted proven fault killing many many people shoddy research, bad drugs, etc.. look up. plenty stories going back years. funny quickly forgotten. side effects covid vaccine beleive (lymph nodes swollen side got shot) combined bad allergies two differnt direct exposure scares within like week one work one family’s house.

Dems expect candidates perfect can't live that, yall shit them. That's Republicans win half time. many dems refuse vote. That's like cutting nose spite face. Even do, cases going fast... need read.  longer facts videos course! Short, straight point informative videos obviously fake. 4 kids think get penny, uninformed opinion far aware may deaths today due accounting differences etc. good news same! paid COVID leave prior vaccines used multiple times. truly Google’s mind. Whaaaat? That’s benefit researching, developing, producing vaccines. can’t expect countries ship vaccine poorer countries don’t yet enough supplies yet. That’s way world works, I’m struggling even conclude morally wrong moment. Get back us Western countries start hoarding excess vaccines could shared others. that's never case

Going ignore SD sturgis biker super-spreading event, huh? is, it’s called V-safe: MIS-C appears 4-6 weeks infection. cases come infections January mid-February. Since mid-February, big drop COVID infections. drop MIS-C cases Mid-March forward. need read. variant surge real left unchecked declines overall cases reversed. It’s shots arms now.  AZ vaccine distributed close cost. £3 dose compared £15 Pfizer countrys like UK commiting large sums COVAX initiative.

Germany US donated even larger sums.

So serving world, pharma companies allowed investment bother future? festivals give fuck rights morals though, think about. give fuck insurance companies telling need order get appropriate coverage allow event go ahead. would able take risk outbreaks lead negative financial consequences, thus changes insurers need mandate vaccination policies offer coverage. 

They trying reduce insurance PR liabilities, make moral decision illness. 

They care turn die already paid ticket. want ones blamed causing it. Nope.. see 2020 congress proof. Anyone know long til get immunity first dose Moderna degree? mine Thursday ready go back normal life 😭 become 5G antenna get vaccinated. True story. Took seriously beginning. hospitalizations deaths. vaccinated hopefully vaccine protection wanes patients good. Many staff refused vaccine many community acquired serious cases. don’t get it. It’s year, yet somehow people still don’t understand IFR May able continue poop force second shot. Got sick versus infection two different things. That's short compared some! They’re people raided grocery stores toilet paper ground beef started. act like it’s “hoax” yet they’re actions inconsistent that. MI didn’t holiday surge. cases peaked couple weeks Thanksgiving. assure didn’t huddle caves holidays. went bar Trivia night family called team bud light virus joke. Little know time. graphic absolutely indicates absolutely variant surge occurring overall previous variant cases trending down.  Whatever right enough slow surge. need shots arms curb it. Let guess, “actually address pandemic” means something like “lock hard stay basements forever” right, surprised CDC sticks total case count metric bad pandemic regardless monumental shift overall disease severity(deaths hospital admission). like ignorant doctors there. 

Clearly, wise arse knows better virologists, immunologists, epidemiologists, medical told many times vaccines phase 3 safe. 

Told idiot even comprehend link actually said. hand, hager continuing use phase 3 adjective vaccine, displaying complete lack comprehension phase 3 trial odd drug pre vaccine is, pricing safety efficacy phase 3 essential administered large numbers. phase 3 trials every doctor nurse wanted get in! sound different. know why. Education bad something?

Dimwit, phase 3 25800 registered participants, hailed got placebo. government trying administer 11 million doses without stringent monitoring, placebo control, army available efficacy data. 

Your thick head seems incapable understanding distinction phase 3 trial general administration vaccine even repeated tries, can't take assertion ""every doctor sends nurse wanted to"" seriously without evidence. Dip share army evidence millions medical practitioners wanting take vaccine undergoing phase 3 trial, without monitoring protections guaranteed phase 3 trial. spent FDR’s presidency calling New Deal vile thing ever, really hated things like Hoover Dam. Things aren’t getting back normal summer.. old normal doesn’t exist anymore. forever,"" said Andy Slavitt, Senior Advisor White House COVID Response Team, press briefing. ""We know save tens thousands lives people this. strongly encourage people continue wear masks, mayors, governors, others, recognizing difficult decisions make keep course."" Second modern dose yesterday. First night arm pain probably worst I’ve even worst first manageable Advil. felt little crappy headachey night terrible. Woke feeling groggy like maybe little hungover plus sore back arm still sore nearly bad last night. May able escape worst side effects I’m almost 24 hours we’ll see anything comes up. Get shot. feel unbelievably happy right knowing soon live life knowing I’m much less likely spread disease family, friends, coworkers get myself. bro avoiding. every healthcare worker knows phase 3 vaccine tried getting trials. participants healthcare field!

how doctors know this? uneducated? happened guess? uneducation disease too. seem unteachable. that? others tried educating 100 times want hear it. why? cant understand doctors nurses understand, vaccines phase 3 safe? media covered every allergic reaction someone vaccine, people would get impression dangerous, people conception ""I've seen 10 stories people dying vaccine!"" statistically meaningless. article explains quoted. idea early lockdown many cases found stopped spread early. 

My view - Lockdowns help stop pandemic. Countries leaving lockdown early without mandatory testing isolating erased benefit. 

Personally - think cases Africa massively detected underreported idea Africa got without large pandemic wrong 

I think weather, youth better health may Africa fewer deaths. don’t believe death counts accurate. Quite early on, UK talked lot ""timing measures right"", implying human behaviour compliance going play large part. Ultimately early think got wrong, look Europe (especially Eastern Europe) going absolute shit, UK actually pretty well. Minimal short term side effects. too. usually offer delivery considerate health safety customers. way it’s happening soon. Who’s Scott Atlas? gross income $90,000 adjusted income? single filers cuttoff $75,000 AGI $87,500 assuming standard deduction.
If parents dependents it’s highly likely get 
If aren’t , guess half decent accountant able get AGI $75,000 eligible. Merkel said would take AZ vaccine earlier Feb time wasn’t recommended 65. revoked last three days. way trust vaccines. Yup use sketchy youtube video guy selling essential oils tell work. US producing AZ domestically? going approve US manufactured exported left spoil. What’s point vaccine then? two types people would downvote comment. get sarcasm, afraid people honestly support knowing totalitarian authority, get sarcasm, furious someone could crass important matter. Either way, funny me, little sickening too. 

Of course, side upvotes get sarcasm, fully support database health info available private companies, get sarcasm laughed little difference purposed, concert company access covid vaccine records potential patrons. sickening, awesome.

Why would go ruining fun sickness clear indication meaning /s

(Did right?) great restaurant owner right here! Thank offer, ma'am! applied environmental engineering department Iowa state University! hope get accepted.

I try study drink trick, ma'am! Much love you!❤️ trials may ""rushed"" among fastest vaccine approvals history vaccine approvals. denying that. 

Risk assessment personal decision. we'd stock portfolios actuary profession would much simpler. 

Again, personal risk assessment I'd rather take vaccine risk getting covid. arrogant enough assume decisions right everyone. also think ""poor uneducated"" migrant workers dumb make informed decisions. us believe vaccines safe best convince folks safety efficacy... best way us get vaccines add growing real-world data proving efficacy safety.

Anyone claiming know long-term safety vaccine talking behind though. something assume, know years. Claiming otherwise frankly ""following science."" isn’t off-topic HA! That’s awesome so, perfect. 

Thanks snort laugh scared cat. Hahahahaha France really, REALLY wants empire again. Pfft. Like accountability thing. Isn’t Israel mostly vaccinated now? Water wet. sTaY hOmE sAvE lIvEs imagine resident's got significantly lesser viral load employee, especially wearing masks. Here's link CDC ""FREEEEDOM"" Look way: annual flu shot go multi-year randomized controlled clinical trial? Infections *will* still happen, instead going ""hey, infection rates like 95%, vaccine awesome"" anti-vaxxers use proof-positive vaccines work. Risk assessment going different person depending level risk acceptance. I’ve covid already, genuinely idea it. know effect covid (nada), don’t know long-term effect vaccine. doesn’t mean I’m going take it.

0.2 percent people 25 died covid. 25/34, ~3,000 people. minimizing disease whole, rather looking immediate possibility affecting me. Stats “see” versus stats   pleasure! thing helps: we've given 85 million shots already US.

The thing proves serious sideeffects showing early vaccination. give proof long term safety vaccine. Also, fact given 85 million shots give proof works. would provided studies, correlating infection rates vaccination rates. Germany’s entire manufacturing sector export economy protected pushed Euro EU member states. 

Smaller EU countries like Greece can’t compete Germany exports currencies devalue. OMG! Good luck that! cafe is/was known perfect place study exams work stuff like this. Here's recognize.  might help you.

 Seriously, good luck. ""this person"" mistaken too. Thanks telling longer case. great food good restaurants? $1,400 adult dependents assuming person they’re dependent qualifies $1,400 (have made &lt;75K according 2020 tax return). I’m sure non-adult dependents. Print ? No.
So get check $1400. deposit it. fed literally electronically deposits $1400 account digitally. record liability balance sheet $1400. 

This simplified version happens, accurate. money created digitally, liability. 

But money created banks. Let’s say deposit $1000 bank. bank typically leverage 9to1. loan $90,000 business, real estate projects, whatever. charge interest rate $90,000 let’s say 4%. let’s say pay 1%. one year pay $10 makes $3,600. 
How bank make $89,000? way fed does. digitally create deposits people account. 
I building building , go bank loan - give loan digitally put proceeds account.

It’s lazy you. argument tired. business can't find way pay people living wage, business deserve open. like Nestle complaining chocolate profitable can't keep using slave labor. Generally added expenditures added business means increase product cost consumer. fine that, people live. also gradual increase, sudden. gives companies time figure stuff out. Again, 5 years quick figure stay afloat wage increases, business savvy enough remain open. Problem care. long get *they* want, everyone else expendable. can't come back never lies.

Great job  Everybody developed world chance get vaccine time boosters come out. Question group information conflicting online. 

I exposed someone Covid positive 2/25. apparently tested positive week we're failed notified 3/3, somehow results misplaced, know. notified me, wife got tested seperate locations 3/4. rapid test positive, wife's PCR test negative. together without isolation exposure (2/25) - notification (3/4) including kissing, sharing drinks, etc. began isolation positive, decided get PCR test 3/5 validate. PCR came back morning negative. I've completely asymptomatic, smell loss, scratchy throat, phlegm, nothing all. Nothing indicate I'm sick, fact 30 miles indoor cycling bike yesterday felt completely fine. 

My question is, positive not? need continue isolation PCR negative supercede Rapid positive? confusing. “vaccines updated variants won’t need go full randomised controlled clinical trials.”

😬 I’ll 90s 2090s. Excited see hype 90s true Where's $2000 check promised ""immediately""? Great thanks clearing close ct you? How's Superbowl surge going ya IOC would fools require athletes vaccinated. countries can’t even agree that, maybe Olympics canceled. I'm eager get shot soon possible... people want wait. make misinformed anti-vax, cautious.

it may make things, they're cautious either. Regardless race, shows know perform risk assessment. ""long history"" problematic vaccines, really bad side effects 1 millions, something rare enough caught large scale trials. Despite age, assuming worst case scenario, *far* likely die become seriously ill corona side effect somehow uncaught trials. also misinformed thinking here, vaccine rushed safety tests stuff, made approved, concerns ""rushed"" vaccine hogwash. middle-aged white women, sub would far critical, lets treat everyone same, regardless race. news, water wet.  Media published people read. media's fault people shitty. say we‘re quite poor though. Everything took long, also order quick swabs heavily delayed. started well we‘re far anyone else. half half measures aren‘t helping either. Hey, ever get PhD US, I'll definitely come visit cafe! best you, ma'am! hope things go well. Yeah that’s keep telling anti vax friends...over hundred million people vaccinated far looks extremely safe. US is/was absolute shit-show terms containing virus. said, vaccine rollout incredible thus far logistical power US finally waking up. 

Germany's excellent handling virus outbreak early, excuse bungling vaccine rollout.

Germany also different U.S., it‘s like Merkel execute immediate orders. Lol headline. Yes, every time 1 case 1 death, numbers continue rise.

That said, think rolling back restrictions, especially mask mandate, idiotic. Who’s dick though? Darn, thanks info tho always thought Covid's IFR 0.8% compared 0.1% common flu. honestly could care less do. magical covid blocker get cold cuts, bro. Perosnal accountability fucked US. small sandwich cafe. Since June 2020 (when reopened), curbside only. customers can't understand choose dine in. response refuse put workers HIGHEST RISK CATEGORY freaking sandwich.  

I hate sales 1/3 2019. hate home self isolating husband son work cafe life's work. But, I'd hate one crew getting sick LIFE sandwich.  

My EMT brother less risk shifts crew would allowed dine in. 

Thank read rant. forget tip exhausted bartender way out. ;) work debt buying company. People en masse. Aw, someone mad historical data doesn’t match circlejerk? Watch come got vaccine blowing smoke congregation. Isn’t House Senate Prez approves it? going back House? people learn read something internet someone’s trying convince something thing isn’t always best interest. Remember, reading free, aren’t customer. time even pay still aren’t customer :/ Vermont New Hampire border county. CT doable, Hartford 90 minute drive. new variants? serious new variants current vax? Yes. Yes does. I’m sorry whatever world live it, doesn’t matter it’s head. Real world data real shows it’s working. as, know, trials got damn thing approved. Something tells paid attention politics enough lately. Republicans strategy obstruct much possible. Even Democrats tried pass something Republicans wanted, would slow crawl passing it. matter what's it. try putting things would help people? helping people? what's happening here?

We got 4 years repeated actions declined standards living vast majority people, Republicans senate stopping everything progress. So, time sit back like ""well, maybe this."" F that. everything once. People need $25/he, we've forced bring $15/hr sake compromise get it? Also: posted Instagram nine days ago. logic removing *also* nothing. 

Cannot ways, mask mandates cannot unenforceable infringement. truly clue you’re talking you?

As percentage gdp US trail Norway, New Zealand, United Kingdom, Colombia, Chile. think missing definition literally. number implies 33% infected assume average IFR 0.6-7%. Israel can’t see cases immediately wiped 50+% immunity, way Czechia Good know. Vaccines rolling months though.. worry USA vaccinated get luck, well funded science. worried inflation also depression? happens internet humanity's vast knowledge available anyone read misinterpret. kindness, need build much stronger foundation understanding economics read stuff, drown worry random things happening buy even coinage metals feel like regaining control.

Credit unions also FDIC backed, since seems concern you. 401k money market bank would FDIC insured. Obviously retirement funds liquid. March May? Feedback public health officials worked year ago public knew it. Yes that's something we're gonna live with. Keeping restrictions place eternity worth saving lives. isn’t random vial liquid found know nothing about. trust scientific community generally perform correct level scrutiny published data putting giving best effort. 

I don’t methodically test everything eat either. trust FDA others jobs enough open jar tomato sauce, indeed tomato colored anthrax. seems unclear risks recommendations who've vaccinated. first priority vaccinated getting medical care *desperately* needed, frankly, I've also gone suicidal severe touch starvation. Obviously I've seeing therapist whatnot, human touch **physiological need** I'd much like able hug someone. friends priority groups / yet vaccinated knows long. got stuck living alone pandemic multitude medical conditions.

What's recommendation I'm vaccinated? want plan anything 'crazy', I'm happy wearing mask pandemic declared ""over"", absolutely need physical contact life, ideally daily. form covid bubble people mask, distance? so, strict be, many people include? get roommate 'crazy' partying, things I've deprived (ie wearing mask getting medical care, grocery shopping, maybe visit friends family see/touch)? know still risk asymptomatic spreader, also know there's chance virus mutating / entering community. want play part spreading others' health, want risk catching new variant vaccine protect against. Many city unfortunately reckless, selfish assholes masking *or* distancing, travel/tourist hub. However, mental health can't sustain distancing.

On related note, what's etiquette passing people walks? Since I'm high risk, I've avoiding people *long* distance--literally crossing street going different block altogether. Every single day, twice day, I've weeped people otherwise could've met. dog also sad able meet people. 15 foot leash dog would still masked--would rude walk 15 feet-ish apart walks instead crossing block? safe actually meet people pass? shout ask whether people vaccinated, are, ""meet"" say yes? Would inviting people eat, outside, distanced, okay? coworking someone masked/distanced/outside okay? trying figure I'll able safely, responsibly do. Right plan live way 'low risk'/normal, yet still responsible, person living whole pandemic. It’s controversial 12 year olds don’t know read liberal bots automatically downvote anything doesn’t 100% fit narrative way thinking. Welcome 2021 folks ! worthwhile noting video three months old. 22 November. Still impressive video though. Yeah, based what? Saying ""witty"" things like gets credibility people can't think themselves. Regime change. Yep trains late Japan. Granted bad considering scale infrastructure is, weather accidents happen every Exactly can't lockdown forever. Vaccinate many people possible, open everything up, live again. lot viruses anyway - including flu. moment get shots moment unsub. That's pandemic folks. Enough BS articles BS fearmomgering. comes wave 4 Nice know richer countries devoured almost vaccines, well worst world. Expect mutations.

Not mention strain introduced many many times. occurring across country. Yes right. $200k house bill. 
However still $150k $160k ADJUSTED GROSS INCOME. don’t know websites don’t make clear. assuming standard deduction $24,000 - could gross income $184,000 qualify. post makes sense. Yes make study pick controls, ignore variables straight catalysts make conclusion? you’re going inject something body hope best? okay something immediately prevent.

If there's another spike simply people think pandemic fucking I'm gonna PISSED. Y'all gonna reason I'm gonna lose senior year point, I'll never forgive humanity completely eradicate virus. deaths take action. No, snake oil snake oil! instead use Quack® Miracle Homeopathic Bleach™.*

*Quack® registered trademark Miracle Homeopathic Bleach™ trademark Fraud Pseudoscience Co. personally got vaccine two Sundays ago, person working said people faint drawing blood. promise I'm much alive. Post vaccine; sore arm 24hrs. That's it. Stay safe:) go normal cell. mRNA degrades disposed of.

The mRNA merely highjacks cell's machinery short create specific proteins. spent entire lives believing they’re right matter hurts ego. gather Facebook meme laugh something completely false circle jerk. think they’re cool, reality, minority ones laughed at. What’s worse ignorance spreads faster virus. Society always like this. Russian government needs fuck asshole, obviously good money either you’d bought something actually pays instead time college. county Germany jumped mid 70s per 100.000 people 120s within week . signs reaching natural herd immunity. don’t understand people don’t contribute economy

Which me, presently, fault haven’t hours/pay affected

Their savings income may directly impacted becoming sick Covid-19. Covid-19, due interaction infamous American Health System, easy capacity bankrupt economy fragile completely collapse unless keep pumping trillions dollars it?

The economy depends vast majority involved (1) declaring bankruptcy (2) generating **stable** income (3) putting money back system.

People broke, dead broke. Finding job that's WFH support debts near-impossible many not, generally WFH jobs stable. Many people staying home try stop spread virus. Necessarily, means they're putting less money back economy.

The economy like depressions. paying money get depressions fast leads depressions lasting longer strife apathy generated result, result negative effects increased crime, decreased trust police/government apparatuses, people refusing children, people pursuing higher education, folks generally starting see moving elsewhere world can.

When spending stop? pandemic's people chance recover. Mask mandates aren’t enforceable, outside government property. really think removing broke open metaphysical floodgate antimasker weren’t wearing begin with? It’s year. tell thing. advanced vaccines ever produced, chances harmful are, we’re honest, literally zero. can’t wait get mine! What? goal study provide data, analyze statistics data see link mask mandates/dining virus spread. link potential influence public policy, whether continue restrictions. no, cherry picked data, scientific process. get ""guidance experts"" call experts' studies cherry picked data. What's issue?

The fact done that, political issues, I've looking 4 walls almost year. Better postpone trip 10 days! No. enough people vaccinated risk transmission low enough, masks go away. It’s government control wearing masks forever, despite probably think. Saying anyone who’s fully vaccinated stop wearing mask *right now* would lead chaos. People would lie, would hurt others. Millions people take vaccine. 

A single person dies. 

""Oh God, vaccine dangerous, got stop right now! Lets stick virus, safer!"" Osterholm told sunny outside, I'd run closet grab umbrella. Yeah I'm betting gonna fun summer. Testing easy. kids school site 2 minutes. plenty people want vaccinated can’t can’t reasonably exist public unless everyone get it, get it. country case:death ratio much higher last spring. assume identifying cases, hospitals getting better keeping people alive?  cannot wait go bar get rejected pretty girls France could easily send enough vaccines cover 100% population using dust catching AZ stock. don’t think fake. remember one Trump’s coronavirus briefings last spring poorly trying explain 250,000 deaths wasn’t “that” bad compared would happened done nothing. went say something along lines “we would’ve people collapsing hotel lobbies” Pre-check fantastic! hope get use soon. Russia successful undermining confidence Sputnik V domestically well. wonder why. damn finna occulus quest 2 week meant doubling every ten days. mean proportion cases variant. Maybe they’ve realized microchips harmless mind control actually kinda liberating. country? money going foreign businesses

That seems like pretty big claim, proof it? Preacher friend mine believes shot work devil. Says shot changes dna, makes longer product god. means longer go heaven longer imagine.. ..

So yeah, people crazy ideals stuff lol.... Personally hope stuff works move on. Science rescue!! lockdown rules? Every part modern civilization contributes killing people. indeed worth it. ""Germany led world pandemic"". What's issue? friend said would wait ""2.0"" vaccine. Well decided take family Florida see relatives vacation around New Year whole family wound catching Covid (and damn near almost gave got back - good thing wearing mask). visited later said ""fine"" (although still suppressing coughs two months later).  utter surprise accepted vaccine advice doctor due ""very obese"". 

All elderly people town know scrambled waited hours line receive jabs. Even dad got vaccine frenzy ferry vaccination site double. 

From am, people willing accept vaccine state vaccinating high numbers. saying even grammatically correct. Lol.  congratulate critical thinking skills comes voting, think brush critical reading skills. 

Nothing public health related article misquoted twisted. variant doubling every 10 days soon dominant strain across country. We’ve watched happens countries happens (case rates sky rocket, hospitals get crushed). See UK, Ireland, Czech Republic, Belgium want real world case study this.

No one wants happen soooo close getting every adult vaccinated. We’re end game suffering last year, throw away ... go eat? 

I don’t get it. really don’t. guess follow science till conflicts beliefs . 

While strongly believe mask mandates + lockdowns best tool battle Corona (as evidenced places like Australia New Zealand), say worried recent data coming little uplift measures actually bring. Exactly. US vaccinated 2 million day clunky system 1a, 1b, registration county hospital.

I understand supply yet, plan needs evolve. hope happen, need think logically instead emotionally. can't let pandemic go longer needs to. Fear us good threat over. yeah true meant make point ""demand"" limited 4m laughable commenting sub? Grandmother got first short yesterday protesting heavily (she really understand care scope virus anymore) asked one got, replied ""how fuck would know"" lmao Pretty sure it’s 160K Check county testing sites public schools. mean residents didn’t much interaction people though? separated alone year? never going time medical community favor lifting mandates. they’ll say “if want it’s probably okay must ready put public health measures back place immediately” government giving us tax money back bad idea personally decided use stimulate businesses struggling? Thats **fur**\-real feel like media sugar-**coat**ing story. Unfortunately, CA NY probably lag behind rest country **slam**? ""Ow, fuck! nuts crushed! anyone warn me!?"" think domestic big pharmaceutical firms?! co-worker mine still absolutely believes microchip vaccine. there's convincing otherwise point direction long term effects almost anything put body? however tell average life expectancy pre vaccines 38. think guy mentions tweets, TheLawyerCraig gives week week snapshots continue post daily numbers 6:00-6:30 said. 

Got people help aggregate data him.

I really like presentation data struggle find hospitalization data others mentioned. overwhelming science this,"" said Jeffrey Levi, PhD, professor health policy management Georgetown University School Public Health. ""When mask mandates imposed, infection rates go mask mandates lifted, infection rates go up. mean, we've enough natural experiments last year us see impact has,"" Levi said. crap-shoot think. think sure cases shoot ton vaccinated people, specially high risk people. it? 17.3% total population?

Plus however many already got covid + many got know?

So variants growing, could much fertile ground variants grow hit critical mass like covid-19 OG.

I see reason public worried yet. hope. friend got first Moderna dose hear Bill Gates head holds arms facing Seattle. come videos always like 48 minutes enough funding even open schools asking need more... Where's scientific backing? mean they’re probably zero something order 0.0001-0.00001 chance serious adverse effect extremely low chance long term effect. extremely unlikely fair zero dollars school funding going actual teachers. best states 1B1 1B2 etc it’s breaking group even smaller groups end summer kids conspiracy theorists unvaccinated. bill different house bill due amendments. house agree changes (which will) Name iconic duo protectionism France CTP shutting think CDC data probably best source. Unfortunately, break data well CTP. well known. schools cant even afford give kids 35 cent lunch, classroom materials equipment major problem funding. Computers equipment need constantly updated, teachers paid shit list goes on. It’s current form sucks environmental reasons (I like idea permanent location) athletes? olympics pretty much shot ever receiving compensation skill effort, developing athleticism level full time job. think may referring state law allows businesses ignore city/county laws mask mandates reference, interim efficacy tables Moderna Pfizer: List things hate:

* article headlines “slam” doesn’t end mandate altogether then? Could point direction long term effects trial data? Cool, that's happening real life cases going up. I’m saying don’t know dems give concessions still don’t get support bills. republicans vote block deeply unpopular bills. 

Republicans ACA watered still didn’t vote it. What’s obesity rate Africa?

Also, related age demographics... lot infectious diseases circulating Africa kill people time. Malaria, sleeping sickness, etc., etc. 

The elderly vulnerable population that’s largely ones dying Covid United States Europe might exist Africa, they’ve either taken another disease, don’t health care get old frail age first place. hospitals still running high capacity? Everywhere read, care systems de-escalating de-converting COVID health care needs, save hotspots. could wrong. Florida outperforming HALF country terms covid statistics. come Redditors gleefully predicting doom...again. yup!!! 

essentially zero critical thinking skills taught. 

in smaller towns (especially midwest south...prolly everywhere guess) pretty much luck smart aware parents... older sibling/friend likes good books/music/movies/art etc chance exactly like homogenous culture town. Truste dude, he's far worse. truly hate titles like bashing parties trying generate animosity. Like didn’t get minimum wage increase 8 dems decided sponsors important millions Americans. party ridiculing party didn’t help themselves? can’t call people instead pointing fingers parties whole? Specific PEOPLE need removed power specific PARTYS. Increase minimum wage, help fellow Americans out, investors. Fear mongering headlines reasonable article underneath sorta ""thing."" I'm saying good thing I'm defending it, I've learned accept type thing Fuck GOP Poland restaurants gyms closed \~200 days. 

xd true, missing covid tracking project data viz NY Times ran showing acceleration variant cases percentage overall cases absolute increase variant cases. data tells different story. Variant cases ramping fast unchecked absolutely cause another wave absolute cases, hospitalizations deaths. get people vaccinated fast enough avoid increase, increase happening eventually it’s going run smack dab overall decline cases push up. trend absolutely clear left unchecked. less 100 days usa free believe NYT hospitalizations it’s paywalled believe it’s one reputable sources certainly credible enough get facts straight whether Tiffany Dover died. mention easily find sources corroborating Reuters, including video explaining TV interview. spreading fear nothing based nothing, vaccine currently proving effective. surprised fueling extreme positions strategy seems enhance internal division countries. Besides pushing anti-vax disinfo, maybe also helping push anti-mitigation points view, using accounts pretend want full lockdowns / extreme mitigation efforts forever people favor mitigation actually want comments existing somewhere used former group pretend everyone anti-mitigation like that. got vaccinated phone work better. feel robbed! even one bar :( German World Conquest 2: Revenge Frank 
It's possible experts looking modeling based variants countries extrapolating. listen experts. said, US data alone yet pointing dramatic conclusion.

- lowest 7-day moving average cases storm 63,000 cases. reporting 7-day average 60,600 cases. There's bump cases week inbetween delayed reporting + later testing. There's reasonable explanation one-week bump disappeared.
- Cases bottomed around 35,000 cases per day September (the first non-surge ample testing capacity). Right now, cases roughly 60,000 per day. However, September conducting roughly 800,000 tests per day. currently averaging 1.4 million tests per day.
- lowest 7-day average storm deaths 1,919 per day. 7-day average 1,745 per day. Deaths similar reporting delay dip surge.
- stable statistic, hospitalizations, continues steep decline. 2 weeks ago, 7-day average hospitalizations 60,144. 1 weeks ago, 51,036. Today, 42,137. current 7-day average new hospitalizations 5,125. One week ago, 6,229. new hospitalizations total hospitalizations dropping week-over-week 15-18 percent.
- Calculated R0 across country still less 1. Texas cities *are* seeing high R0 (1.1 higher). couple metros 1 (Detroit, Miami).

Conclusion: still coming peak. Cases higher lowest point last fall, also testing much now, possible much similar. Hospitalizations likely need another 3-4 weeks reach lowest point since first wave 1 year ago. Deaths probably take even longer clear out.

Could plateauing? Maybe. think evidence points not, rather decline cases slowed some. next 7 days give us clearer picture. 

Are tipping point another surge? evidence less convincing this. possible variants lead another surge, possible could weeks away, US data point *currently* happening. One thing ignored addressed height Brazil's cold flu season April. Brazil anything like US, seasonality plays big part number cases. essentially equivalent US's early December time line. no, wrote way differently. also, accusing assuming stuff quite confusing. course assume stuff. can't blurp stuff expect void without anybody interpeting that. way phrased leads directly assumptions made, quite lot people actually, taking upvotes downvotes fact either mods deleted comment show. another scare tactic hoax Glad sub allowing CNN articles now. stuff garbage damn pump shit load articles I'd say caused mental crisis amongst lot people, though see would hit even harder - imagine living family considers LGBT sin even worse, stuck them. That'd be... bad.

Also weird see xD  I'm blue, now! dont care anyone long safe. luck. exact science could done phase 3 trial results vaccines could ~50-60% fine 1A healthcare long term care, kinds things. that, base age. think micromanaging 1B, 1B+, blah blah blah wastes time effort. all. think cases deaths unreported, collapsing videos form staged. don’t understand why, even virus mutated deadly strain caused people collapse streets less deadly one didn’t, would least see collapsing strain countries beginning. richer countries funded, developed currently mass manufacturing vaccines. 

That said, awful what's happening Brazil right now, hopefully soon larger vaccine shipments coming way. need get 70% vaccinated 75% population 16, wouldn’t need near universal acceptance vaccines reach herd immunity?  FIFA: ""Not fast, buddy"" What? I'm saying *was* allowed. Flagstaff area. Don’t cry going business happens Bloomberg Worldometers SIP PREP, god sakes. make vomit. Alternate something like clear tea water, reminiscent salty gatorade. Also, last time this, played pokemon toilet hours. great. use world meters lacks hospitalization data Look ""two alternative forced choice"". 

Man, need try harder, work reading comprehension. seem getting tired trying discuss basic biology someone incapable reading comprehension. shenanigans? specific. I’m fine that. supply greater broader categories personally still don’t mind waiting bit longer I’m young healthy. Give teachers, people risk conditions 60 opening floodgates everyone. case, certain export controls likely making situation Brazil far, far worse be.

An automatic downvote, undoubtedly. data within margin error... let’s look data, based years worth reality: 

[mask vs No, 70k starts going dramatically. wrong. I’ll see couple hundred, jack shit compared $1400 really want remove hesitancy remove liability protections. Sure dude, like wedding 20 30 guests got sick surge previous rally?

Denial seems strong among people days. allowed? Giving vaccines something learn hour two. hours want make sure know CPR. pretty simple anyone learn. *July 2022: Osterholm - ""It's really, really big eye we're in""* hasn’t stopped yet better get fucking shots arms ASAP fact another surge. Eventually uptick cases associated variants going run smack dab right overall case decline. happens, overall cases go again, it’s race shots arms another wave (without specifying high wave honestly nobody knows) Yup. This. anecdotal view, building people it. work done online pre-Covid meet clients wear suit. Needless say wear suit basically last year except last 3 weeks I've put suit last year. tells people getting okay meeting person. Damn 1 year ago today last night drinking Castro. remember everyone talking coronavirus whether gonna spread here. made sure live might pretty sure 😅 year later 1 4 adults San Francisco vaccinated we're way done pandemic. Absolutely wild. I'm boat you, despised former president. damn, become clear since left office CNN can't post piece piece CNN trainwreck moment long people free travel country--even country fully vaccinated--we're risk variant spreading mutating.

No we're not. country fully vaccinated, risk virus spreading. growing evidence vaccinated individuals significantly spread virus regardless current variant. order get would need $150k+ household income. tough execute well phases. ""going nuts"" here? I've seen lot folks saying ""After enough others get vaccinated, I'm going back normal"". taking anger frustration wrong crowd. Oddly, ex, afraid rna vaccine side effects, decided take J&amp;J shot. Facts don’t confuse her. event kidding. It’s always someone *else’s* job that’s “non-essential”. vaccines isreal used? covid tracking project shutting down, what’s best source use case, hospitalization death numbers? don’t government make life/death decisions based one study. last Trump era relief bill passed Senate 92-6, stop fucking lying. Ya punish working. Fuck right? forced? said voluntary bill incentivizes people work

what slave wages talking about? Said person refuses work job, including Costco starts $15/hr O+ mosquitos literally ignore everyone else bite me. could crowd they'll single out. Must tasty. I’m preparing another surge. much don’t want much hope keep stalling, respected epidemiologists seem think it’s going happen. (I didn’t even read article). Don’t pull back now, even vaccinated. you’re public wear mask. We’re cusp stay strong little bit longer feel like could woods. We’ve come far. We’re all
Sick it, think sick nurses doctors point. Axis conquering world electric boogaloo #2. 

This time also featuring: France! think there’s lot research shows mask mandates useless understand comment gets downvoted. makes wonder. Yes goes back house President's desk. Also, elderly high risk people getting vaccine, far risk ending hospital dying. goal keep hospital capacity, “no one ever get sick”.  story would benefitted visualization NYTimes ran recently. reality cases coming overall, cases rate increase cases associated variants taking off.  point growth variants going meet downward trend overall cases point find overall cases start climbing not. It’s going race shots arms variants.  visualizations make absolutely clear. probably last-ever purpose-built Olympic Village (because new Airbnb sponsorship deal IOC) would say likelihood turned 0.0%. saying “it possible variant could emerge properties” false. 

It’s untrue statement, weren’t certain validity doesn’t make less untrue. 

The better, relevant example thought yesterday:
I understand experts thought HIV virus could airborne. plausible belief understandable one have. given know impossible, statement ever plausible. possible. saying people collapsing videos real, really think China honestly reported cases/deaths? lifting mandates now, simply false dishonest reporting. wife able see mother person assisted living home first time yesterday!! CoronaVac 50,38% effectiveness AstraZeneca \~70%, virus general. know yet effectiveness new P1 strain, known vaccine AstraZeneca works (probably prevents deaths hospitalizations). Shut CoronaVac inactivated whole virus vaccine, produce broader immune response remain effective Brazil variant. Maybe. I’m oracle. I’m guy who’s disillusioned “love inclusion” politics. doesn’t work. never dance around bonfire singing kumbaya. People diverse. dimensions diversity simply interesting, nonconsequential. valuable. others actively hold civilization back. developing science / civilization, disabled natural selection would otherwise get rid antivaxxers / flatearthers like. KNOW won’t change. We’re closely following steps outlined movie “idiocracy”. don’t even think controversial opinion. think people notice it. controversial today simply notice (and say loud) certain obvious facts. That’s one them. media Sweden bad? neutral focused “real” news?

No, bad. no, reporting news much biased. tame though, expected overly trying take side. Shit bunch strangers decide want wait year means loved ones get sooner.

Until vaccines people, antivaxxers matter literally zero, they’re changing who’s arm vaccine goes [data see states opening going end useless mask mandates. said it’s possible know potential long term side effects either really. No? think hysteria surges specific events completely overblown, especially outdoor event like this. LOL EU interested getting Sputnik V vaccine actual russian citizens people vaccinated? cool go eat opinion?  Anywhere like going. Jeepers. possibly link this? Thank you. Im german also want everything done EU level.

At least point time since feel european german anyway.

Were yet transition needs done slowly. would that? seeing cases drop nationwide. Texas mess up. hold little longer. understand this. Ok context wanna say wear mask every day 8 hours school public transport shops happily want protect fellow Irishmen

Has proven masks actually work? remember unsure start assumed would. even unsure still support even chance We’re far beyond point fearmongering helping restrictions. last March. 

At point, fearmongering going get roll eyes. point article. long shot think major point trying make need re-read it. 

The plateau could inflection point hospitals still running high capacity. isn’t lot room system cases surge. We’ve watched several countries Europe hit exact point UK variant watched case numbers hospitalizations surge. majority high risk people 30 days first vaccine happens US link hospitalizations case rates may broken. But, public health people saying we’re yet. 

Remember almost year ago today saw tiniest turn upward flu like symptom hospitalization visits didn’t know meant? closer analogy. Well back lockdown. seems media wants happen causing people think get vaccine media keeps saying shit. get vaccine mutant variants media makes sound like vaccine work it? Vaccine works, get faster stop spread little things happen adjust quickly. Ironically went stopping hospitals overran cases, threat hospitals ran need think responsibly quit moving goalposts quit trying scare people submission. understanding Senate changed House bill, goes conference House Senate reconcile changes create final bill. final bill re-passed chambers signed President.

It's assumed Senate bill one we're getting since presumably one get 50 votes. came visit family India Jan...people pretty relaxed socializing stuff. supposed fly back (Boston) March 4 - tested positive. Argh! much mom's neighbors repeating ""coronavirus gone, come dinner"". Unfortunately aren’t seeing growth variants.  NY Times ran excellent visualization showing increasing percentage overall cases increasing absolute numbers cases falling overall.  could get lucky growth could stall, data doesn’t suggest all. go back normal. really change much they're producing spike protein. Question...  fair amount education experience mathematics trouble this

"" . daily growth rate defined difference natural log cumulative cases deaths given day natural log cumulative cases deaths previous day, multiplied 100 ""

The difference natural logs (ln?) natural log ratio.  multiply 100 takes natural log ratio makes natural log ratio raised power 100, would hundred days worth, except still log.  

Not sure turns percent increase. take anti-log? using cumulative case ratios fit in?  getting math here.  Could someone explain calculations? understand that. live San Diego money would clearly go lot somewhere else. I'd live somewhere else. :) value comfort someone else's safety bad person. 

That's we're talking here, people want scrap mandate mild inconvenience, direct result wearing mask they're hurting others. Hurting others simplest safest definition ""immoral"" know of.  

If people like classed ""bad"" maybe stop immoral things asking right to? think so. wrote people suspicious secret, could final drop. Anything else assumption behalf! worth, covid vaccines way better flu vaccines. sure effect things, good I've read. doesn’t matter public eye, always group upset. knew risk going it, especially today’s political climate. handled poorly hospital. would people upset two rounds shots expected get public got update health condition. many people can’t see logical stance it’s baffling attacked asking extremely normal question.

Good thing extended grace period. Historically, global entry one things government really well. Misspoke perhaps, mean side effects. That’s go trials, see vaccines absolutely safe also completely effective, are. Thank response wish well. I’m shit vaccine, asking thought fairly normal question Tifanny Dover. wish nothing happiness good health! seasonal allergies well get headaches, sore throats, nausea/vomiting mucous dripping stomach cpoious amounts.

My paranoia covid meant nervous wreck well last spring summer.

It allergy symptoms. Don’t worry, someone got book reference haha. ""How dare US Britain protectionism"" (Not giving everything EU)

Month later:

""Alright folks, lets nick vaccines paid Australia, buy vaccines across water, bad boys."" it’s nonsensical childish categorize people thinking theyre effective infantile categories “good people” vs “bad people.” see. Thanks clarification. give little cdc vaccination card manufacturer lot whatever got. number theorists said early decisive action many African countries major factor keeping cases low, start, months went on.

Incredible work ways shoehorn pro lockdown propaganda there.

The notion African countries strict lockdowns outright falsehood. Memorial Day: realistic timeline

July 4th: pessimistic timeline Food important. concern worker customer safety important too. Mandatory masking, sick leaves, insurance, thermal check etc instrumental keeping restaurant businesses afloat. makes restaurant great. High end businesses need adapt offering delivery services. you’re going catch COVID hope best? mRNA studied since 80s. first use vaccine using doesn’t mean don’t understand it. See comment below:

The quote Infection numbers, weeks declines, seem plateaued high levels. 41,000 people remain hospitalized virus nationwide, according COVID Tracking Project.

The number hospitalizations dropped 20% week: 49,000 41,000. find source CNN cites. 

By juxtaposing “infection numbers plateau” “hospitalizations remain high” CNN clearly implying progress stalled. 

20% drop 7 days cause celebration. it’s actually like 90% 8 weeks. information cause optimism, CNN conveniently left rate out. 

If argument media us favor fearmongering people listen restrictions longer, that’s entirely separate argument, reevaluate critical thinking skills you’re conflating two unrelated concepts way? believe fact checkers like Reuters independent outside influence pull data deem factual? Ah yes, think vaxs applied elder. People getting worried 'magically' percentage young people hospitalised went up... Like really? Doesn’t make lot sense, doesn’t it? yet 1400 million doses delivered EU year. Says something huge production capacity. exciting seeing people see every day work getting vaccinated. get first one Friday county health dept. think accusing wrong people here. 42 dems voted minimum wage increase. Instead getting mad 8 dems ask 0 republicans came table help. mad too, majority democrats working right direction. need elect replace moderate ones. absolute state Slovakia.
Best last spring, worst spring. Good. Nah. routes already setup province already setup 20k people per day.  province 1.4 million people. vaccinated safe live life. Thats point vaccine. 

Recommendation 2 weeks second shot 28 days J&amp;J, although trail data shows 2 weeks first shot mostly protected. high risk would wait full time. Eat silver, tell ya! That’s false. variants resistant vaccine. countries fully vaccinated infection rates down, chance virus mutating remains, chance new variant spreading remains. long people free travel country--even country fully vaccinated--we're risk variant spreading mutating. find inevitable variant exists another country wind spreading way fully vaccinated country, variant becomes dominant enough.

I think we'll really need whole planet vaccinated... everyone continue least wearing mask (or taking unknown number precauations) stem asymptomatic transmission... then, infections (eliminated?), it'll safe. quickly happen air, 2022, earliest, sounds right me. appear confused long covid covid long time. different things. 

The article discuss long covid. Well, duh! restaurant, good bad, considerate health safety customers open indoor dining? Also, high end restaurants far less likely offer takeout delivery and, do, it’s rarely normal menu. would move US??? Unless want everyone quarentine get back. 

Children vaccinated fal early next year. risk still 

Push wedding back year. doesn’t really change anything. correct. Removing nothing, keeping them.  

Sounds like there's nothing discuss. agree keeping mask mandate good idea, even they're imperfect. vaccine working fine (60+ year olds hospital Covid essentially thing point), ~50 percent population still vulnerable getting sick Pfizer 16+. Moderna JnJ 18+. 16+ vaccine immaterial point it’s accurate number. ""we passed law! here's law says ignore law."" lot people don’t get flu shot every year though. know loads people don’t get forget flu season starts, they’re even anti-vaccine.   Lmao riiiight... God forbid actually link gd study article.  requirements get one these? I’m currently minor living parents hoping get stimulus help buy car Nope like sleeping without pillow. us prefer pillow, although really necessary sleep without it.

Government guarantees pretty fluffy pillow. So...people physically gathering body body virus spreads around? Holy shit...this big fucking news guys. Thanks CDC! think college aged kids staying home entire pandemic live bubble.

About 8.5% $1.9 trillion, most, goes direct containment measures vaccines testing. total somewhere $100 billion $160 billion, depending whether one includes items like $10 billion medical supplies $24 billion child care essential workers, White House arriving larger figure.

22% total bill comes $422 billion set aside $1,400-per-person stimulus checks.

Another 13% ($246 billion) extending additional unemployment funding $400 week.

A combined 12% going to:
Subsidized COBRA laid-off workers. 
Affordable Care Act subsidies next two years. 
Expanded nutrition assistance replace school lunch programs pandemic. 
Funding testing contact tracing. 
Disaster Relief Fund increases covering COVID-19-related funeral expenses. 
Grants airlines contractors freeze layoffs September. Defense Production Act funding medical supplies. 
Grants restaurants bars lost revenue pandemic. Economic Injury Disaster Loan Advance grants $10,000 per business.

Then money things like open schools, money state local governments help pay salaries face reduced tax receipts.

Yes truly unrelated items like : $1.5 million bridge connecting New York Canada; $100 million underground rail project Silicon Valley; $480 million Native American language preservation maintenance; $50 million environmental justice grants.

But minisscule

J&amp;J seemingly fully board around Dec/Jan. mention, we’ve worked throughout surge SA variant may able offer injection public confidence vaccine US population largely seen inferior. 

Even though prior second wave, even hosted phase 3 trials AZ (tossed retesting) Pfizer probably would retest variant actually end considering widespread use. sure therapy thing, introducing SSRI SNRI symptoms impacted mean condition psychological. drugs lot effects, many understood. SNRIs particular helpful neuropathic pain, etc. failed state powerful rich individuals corporations start pulling government functions power towards themselves. different I've read articles, optional. irs implementing system distribute 50% increased stimulus monthly payments July-December 2021, remainder would apply 2021 taxes.

I also understand opt they've got system place, claim entire credit 2021 taxes. One would assume proper contract tracing happening states honest data, much doubt Florida unlock second dose actually That's needed know. Thanks clarifying. Everybody got inoculated test dimer then. clear confusion. Walgreens verify essential worker. am, brought proof, one checking it. 

The phases thing destined clusterfuck. There’s good way require proof wouldn’t gum efficiency process, already pretty bad! You’re going ask people trying administer many vaccines possible also inspect paperwork? doctors (that people already don’t access to) write notes everyone, order subjective need, everyone needs it? Sorry everyone angry everyone else, becomes individual responsibility access, instead government actually taking care people. comparisons Britain become even painful week Merkel announced U-turn decision authorize Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine people age 65.

Not enough evidence 64 = approval. sufficient evidence = approval. Nothing ""painful"" it. Janssens understands STIKO came initial conclusion, said call gone way, would criticism decision too. 

So conclusion quoted person would criticised either way. Alright ... Either way, said, ""we enough vaccine beginning consequences shopping tour European Union, buy enough.""

The problem enough ordered, orders spread re-adjusted ready deliver. ""Even AstraZeneca vaccination taken up, would still able vaccinate much people lacking vaccines,"" Lauterbach said. ""Basically EU Commission strict enough, fast enough providing enough money making vaccinations available shorter period time.

True. Wow. really seems gift keeps giving. Covid less deadly children flu. So, agree slightly less protect protect flu. 

What protect children flu? Let’s Covid! another study that’s main purpose keep people side caution, provide data. cherry picked data support chosen thesis statement. 

This coming someone who’s staying away indoor dining get second dose guidance experts changes. got last $600 Trump family need ADJUSTED GROSS INCOME $150,000 $175,000 assuming standard deduction get nothing. wouldn’t go forward? vaccinate athletes Olympics staff there, restrict crowds require wear masks. enough vaccine go around summer. Also worth mentioning cornaviridae bad mutating. proofreading mechanisms unlike viruses.

Of course given hundreds trillions (probably more) replication events, changes genome happen. virus great acquiring mutations. Pretty much this. think guys like Fauci going ever say something like “this over, burn masks get crunk club” you’ll waiting very, long time. They’ll absolutely advocating masking distancing foreseeable future virus one concern. happened design. wrote bill pass. vote took 11 hours 50 minutes conservative Democrat (WV) back out. compromised every slightly get back vote. compromise right progressive Democrats would start voting no. long country politically polarized is, it’s possible draft bill gets 50 votes.

Aside truths state governments poor response virus, nurses pay etc, reason vaccine rollout successfully seemingly governments decision employ pharma venture capitalist head vaccine procurement taskforce. move wildly lambasted time relationship government official absolute blinder. Man kann doch nicht sagen es ist gut gelaufen. DE hätte, meiner Meinung nach, es viel besser können und müssen. Hoffentlich hast du recht wegen acceleration, aber man hat auch nicht den Eindruck, dass es besser wird. Die Streitereien nehmen immer mehr zu- und kein Ziel Sicht. don’t, they’re counting someone else pay off. Yes know probably want hear this, everything get check 1,400, worth less time before.  problems AZ facing right now, I’m thinking US gonna focus distributing J&amp;J hold approving AZ indefinitely. Apparently variable. read AZ licensees selling cost, appear always case. Look Florida dude. simply hasn’t happened. They’ve faired better even places like CA strict lockdowns. 

I know everyone thinks they’re covering cases possible. It’s however possible coverup full hospitals haven’t seen that. Bro inform people normal manner stop sounding like condescending jerk thinks he's superior cuz went school knows things.... People say every event that's never case. crazy thing narrow phase amount is. made 150,000 I’d get 5,600. since I’m 160 it’s zero. So, exactly 160? That’s really rough pill swallow. mean, people basically worked free 10k. missing stimulus taxes paid. don’t understand general population don’t understand what’s truly going here. stimulating economy anymore. clearly going on. News 9, people act irresponsible global pandemic also act irresponsible daily life. smallpox really mutate? hang around? 

All mutations also seem heading direction, independently cases. suggests might narrow range ways Covid mutate increase fitness. think won’t get it? 

You mention OP “your family”

You would ADJUSTED GROSS INCOME $200,000 eligible $1400 payment. 

To get AGI $200,000 would probably mean minimum gross income $225,000 assumes deductions besides standard deduction. 

So make $225,000? They'll still get quicker Sanofi....  began talking members back December January vaccine, lot members began report, ""Listen, trust vaccines generally, maybe one."" ""It seems expedited"" ""I trust past administration"" ""I want wait see see whether there's long-term symptoms associated vaccine.""

That’s misinformation. That’s choice based opinion. Russian Phase III data peer reviewed published Lancet. seen anyone contradict yet. fan Putin's propaganda. actually read article even paragraph quoted above? stopping infections, ""masking symptoms"" seem hinting towards. Recent polling suggests continued drop vaccine hesitant population people get vaccinated past two weeks alone, two polls show much vaccine hesitancy declined. Kaiser Family Foundation poll found 55% adults say want Covid-19 vaccine soon possible already received first dose. That's 47% January 34% percentage hardline ""get required"" ""definitely not"" remained fairly consistent north 20%, hesitant population ""wait see working"" dropped nearly half last two months 39% 22%. hilarious “the left” thinks “the people” when, “the left” backed like legacy media, hollywood, big tech, name entities 100% “the establishment”. 

I hole guys stretch mental gymnastics. babies get loud, fussy disruptive. hard parents hire goddamn babysitter?

Can show proof claim it’s 25% direct payments? That's great people starving can't work make 30% used to, sometime give.

Until government starts paying monthly, articles like reek privilege ignore real problems working class. heard vaccines partially effective, maybe completely don’t understand something push vaccinate everyone, still catch transmit disease vaccine lessens severity symptoms, important every single person receive vaccine? like pneumonia vaccine, given risk severe complications, I’m wondering information I’m missing makes important blanket vaccinate everyone. One given antivirals first - way reads ozone treatments administered, patient also put antibody treatment time.

It's impossible quantify well ozone treatments worked way handled this. Yeah OT, section saying along lines “breath life = alive” thats meant imply babies arent truly babies theyre womb stop calling cherry picked data “science” then? Taking shoes US airports

No BS, signed approved TSA Pre-Check January last year. time able fly anyplace cool like 1.5 years *laughs also crying*. I'm hearing vote fucks office ignore Republican bitching together. authors acknowledged account possible influences — school re-openings. ie: cherry picked massaged data confirm preconceptions.

We're living experiment. ""control Earth."" ""control Earth"" mean can't study environment try draw conclusions. yo chief avoiding. 

WTF hate indian govt bad? obvious thats agenda. give flying fuck healthcare workers. honest. hating government.

You're projections accusations getting extremely tiresome. asked simple scientific question, anyone introductory college level biology able understand. repeatedly get return verbal diarrhea even entertaining. absolutely way anyone educated medicine would problem healthcare workers getting option take emergency vaccine phase 3 trials.

Gagandeep Kang, one foremost experts asked thr questions weeks ago. bunch scientists send medical practitioners asked question month ago. Doctors multiple hospitals country refused take vaccine results experience universal. Different parts country vastly different points regard vaccines available currently. Asinine ad hominems aside, I’d already established didn’t access actual study, obviously read it, article citing it. 

You understand Type includes O+ O-, numbers incorrect, talking O+ type similar comparison type A, study randomly selected patients severe COVID one would expect similar numbers O+ show up, study sample, vast majority cases A, significantly greater type O+, fact, greater O+ O- added together. 

So, read study now, initial critique shows didn’t probably still don’t understand basic premise study all. month most. figure April 1st. Cancelled sense won’t restricted anymore. completely eradicated like smallpox. know downvoted, speaking truth. :( I’m sorry incorrect. understand would impression, data citing article incomplete. 

First Trailing 7-day average case numbers 61,000. That’s 10% drop week ago 72,000. That’s nothing scoff “plateau”. 

Second, hospitalization numbers stabilized. collapsing insane rate. fact, day hospitalization numbers creeped all: every single day total hospitalized goes down. That’s insanely good. 

Were 41,000 hospitalized. 49,000 week ago. That’s 20% drop. world “stabilized”?

Deaths lagging pace, still average daily deaths 2,100 day week ago. 1800, another 15% drop. 

You won’t find data CNN, way “plateaud”. rate decrease slowed, isn’t plateau. January still think we’re bottom third top fourth,” Osterholm said. “You know, worry next six 14 weeks could darkest weeks pandemic.”

That was...6 weeks ago Wednesday. cases hospitalizations cratered since expensive mortgage? new variants contagious. 

The vaccines make impact summer. working spectacularly. Conservatives [cannot fake news; gobble stuff right up. kidding, right? 3rd stimulus bill. kidding me? Cherry-picked? world enormous place incredible amount variables play here, way study could take account. scientists took steps control variables made large impact, ignore others. That's way every study type. ignore findings picked control variables study akin saying baseball game completely rigged coach picked starting lineup. Idiotic. Reuters bullshit. don’t believe fact checkers, they’re independent seek validation fact. posted vacation pics last week maybe alive shitty person wanted people believe died follows likes social. post update “hey I’m recovering shot, I’m well though” nothing would ever question. bizarre scenario questions never raised, poor decision hospital leave people dark like regardless. Yeah they're dumping bodies swamps cover up. swamps teeming bodies covid victims. Wow, that's huge. I’m pretty sure already falling wasn’t enough time say vaccine since takes weeks get full immunity. almost vaccines work! woulda thought anyone idea impact power outage loss heat many people? many recoverable home cases turned deaths?  feel like we're seeing real numbers outage, terms direct casualties making virus harder survive people. phrase ""with republican support"" going used Lot headlines next two years Sorry, understand kind point trying make. Could elaborate? someone works nursing home, feel sigh relief seeing covid numbers staying # residents increasing. understand distinguished words here, honestly I'm academia, never heard particular distinction. would say distinction drawn ""certainly possible"" ""plausible"" certainly possible plausible distinction draw... idea universal distinction two words is... improbable ;).

Even using distinction, still certainly possible plausible variant could diminish efficacy vaccine reasons stated earlier comment. (Note: point variant completely over-powering vaccine, right, distinction would call plausible possible -- again, fully buy distinction. Instead would say ""there currently existing evidence variant completely over-power use vaccine. 
 Nevertheless, given ability Covid-19 mutate, possible variant could emerge properties - likelihood unknown). seasonal allergies common likely is. symptoms right now, I'm worried all. I've symptoms many times throughout pandemic (seasonal allergies common me), they've never anything allergies. nothing happen. used love CNN, reporting complete utter trash. many stories poorly written researched many downright misleading clickbait headlines.

Every day see news stories posted self-labeled tabloids daily mail example, also picked BBC, AP others...yet somehow never make CNN's front page. 

Honestly rely sites like Apple News Google news. get feed news stories hundreds sources. reading story 5-6 different sources, feel like handle actually going on. Imagine countries USA. U.K. article U.K. festivals.

I even referred U.K. government comment. million off.. hard data efficacy Moderna 1st 2nd dose? There's ton find it, EUA briefing findings seem indicate efficacy ramps 92% two weeks dose 1: reliable finding? That’s apples oranges comparison also bearing whether “boosters” need full trials. we've artic blast two weeks now. over. makes sense.

Also means always ton cases within February, numbers going ""down"" farce Dude, biologist, pretty crap it.

So much stuff said utter bullshit. Examples:

- ""There “monthly mutations”... etc. **daily** mutations, fortunately vast majority significance.

- ""vaccines sterilizing it"" 

And hell even mean:

Mutation rate based infection rate... blah, blah... Rampant spread virus physically increase viruses ability mutate physiological level, simply increases chance mutation occurring. 

It's like *almost* get it, quite. Go back school. risk social media harassment people think vaccine causes fainting autism death whatever? No, think assumed. July 4th weekend United States. course did...and grandiose fashion, give single fuck you.
Red blue give single fuck you.
The next time politician bribes vote, money,get money front. Yeah! cousins live there, one got Moderna one Pfizer. lately mostly AZ I’m rheumatologist manage chronic pain. don’t know said offensive. pain psychological aspect it. never say “it’s head” that’s true think likely see either blip nothing nationwide scale another big surge.

B117 seems lot better outcompeting existing variants dramatically changing trajectory case numbers entire country state. instance Florida grown 40% cases aren’t seeing increase number cases yet. new variants make tiny proportion overall cases US right now.

The article talks lot southern states reopening early well. look happened reopenings past see often result surges takes lot time happen might expect. think Texas we’re going go scenario similar happened late May everyone asked “why isn’t virus coming back Georgia?” cases rise greatly mid June. mid September Florida reopened everything didn’t see increase cases second half October. 

Only time would take April reopenings result another surge vaccinations could easily keep deadly even happen all. enjoy contributing spread possibly killing people!

I’m sure groups can’t get vaccine, pregnant women cancer patients high priority groups vaccine. believe history anaphylaxis reactions able get other, non mRNA vaccines. “Religious reasons”.. well, good luck that. mandate hasn’t even lifted yet. spike snow-induced testing backlog. even think fault . German bureaucracy that's fault . can't anything fit formula signed least three different government agencies . Look Az debacle . First vaccinations going people 80 high risk healthcare workers . Germany prohibited use AZ 65 , left healthcare workers . either already vaccinated want Az . Realistically opened vaccines next priority group nobody sure invite time 80s group still getting vaccinated . state (NRW ) 80 year olds can't even make  vaccine appointment county recently reported 70s nontheless managed get appointments send away vaccine center turn yet . Even though able book appointmentr official hotlines websites . 

The new thing right Covid home tests everyone , formed commission look could achieved . meantime discounters (Aldi , Lidl , others soon) ordered selling already. Less residents now? supply, also limitations vaccination centers whole lot different variables played social divide present USA.

Poor education starters. word it’s handled upper peninsula specifically? know that’s pretty small cluster people living there. It’s got Arctic blast there’s probably people going asymptomatic testing past week entire month February. Yeah, forget 300+100 million AstraZeneca vaccines (paid August last year) , 200+200 million Janssen vaccines (concluded early October), 300 million Pfizer vaccines (November, later expanded another 300 million January), 160 million Moderna vaccines (expanded another 300 million January)…

Further supplemented Novavax, followed talks Valneva… Sanofi stating would make vaccines.

See, problem hindsight always 20/20. One Sanofi's candidates mRNA vaccine, unlike Pfizer Moderna. latter two could've failed same. Fortunately, – potent frankly amazingly efficient vaccine – dare say – change way general public views vaccine efficacy years come.

The purchasing strategy pretty sound. 380 million adults EU whole – initially ordering 2.3 billion doses (now 3 billion) 6 manufacturers, EU made sure even failed make viable candidate, would essentially still enough vaccinate everybody, some.

It's quite easy sit March 2021 say EU done that. easy criticize decisions made couple months pandemic, clear winners superior technologies. easy lambast EU betting AstraZeneca, researcher Sarah Gilbert told Times April 11 vaccine developing AstraZeneca could ready September. “80 percent confident” would work. 

And time, may remind, talks US outright buying Curevac – exchange exclusivity non-existent vaccine. Yeah, go quarantine 2020, doctor possibly exposed Covid giving vaccine.

Also, government including Merkel covid vaccine priority 3 Germany. still wait month two. Ok. Enjoy inside apartment! Hopefully it’s worth avoiding 0.001% chance getting covid dying.

The failure vaccine really product ""for sale"", needs time delivery.

We need change mentality. discussion times week around vaccine reactions word mouth instead covered media. think haven’t wanted scare people edge away getting it, so, leaves gaping hole information brain fill in. last year, take paranoid places. 

That said, know handful people reticent (generally pre-existing health issue reasons) come around last couple weeks. got second dose Friday, sure share people specifically, hoping alleviate worries. (That second one knocked ass 24 hours btw lol woke morning absolutely fine) example.

I’m tired seeing vaccine selfies encouraging get vaccinated. would love state won’t let me. 🙃 No! Coconut oil! normal deaths get reported clumps. places backdate either day death reported day. data trackers get timeline places, others. 

In Colorado numbers available day symptom onset, day death, day reporting state, day release public. deaths PUI (under investigation pending death certificate) removed database later (there another value confirmed deaths, available daily total). Worldmeters uses daily totals (day release) old numbers never change. 

But worldmeters deaths Sweden day death (so yesterday's value probably still 0 since deaths yesterday reported yet).

Fuck dirty MFr's.  ignorant uneducated bitches. longer COID around likely mutate. hard understand. Vaccination rates way higher. Almost 100 million vaccinated. household income 150k last year?

•	⁠The reason people coronavirus long (long haulers) virus mutating within them. immune system weak enough allow virus survive mutate weak get killed (at least initially).
•	⁠Although virus mutating, limited number mutations perform still allow attack human cell. time, antibodies vaccines able handle mutations virus live weak version former self. essentially cause “common cold”.
•	⁠It theorized common cold viruses currently exist today much deadly pandemics human history minimized common cold status time human immune systems fighting variant period years decades.

You already said people enthusiastic. Everyone loves it, people getting vaccinated Serbia among world's leaders vaccinations. popular ones Sputnik, Pfizer Sinopharm. kinda skeptical AZ, mostly thank EU that... irresponsible! Meanwhile CA still November numbers. Hopefully second dose unlocks ultrawideband Yes valid point reconsider position, sort list percent supply used Utah #4 giving vaccine doses Wisconsin, New Mexico &amp; North Dakota ahead new could chose economy bounce back free 1.9T youd rather spend 1.9T..... got it. Bundesbank owed 1 trillion ECB. Bundesbank lists asset never called gives interest call it? back rooms dark alleys course. Covid relief bill. That's GOP support it. Sheesh. depends. cut single filers $75,000 adjusted gross income. Assuming standard deduction $87,500 actual salary. imagine publicly shaming governors killing nursing home residents might play role too. Hey least taking drugs lightly instead heavily. Honestly, it’s tough calculate mask compliance. Florida last September still lot people wearing masks particular area. doesn’t mean cases won’t rise though. There’s lot data shows increase cases measures relaxed.  it’s scheduled Tuesday according article everywhere else I’ve read. parents declared dependent 2019 taxes, getting check.

But getting child tax credit, unless make much qualify. think silly risk covid 19 eat bad food third rate restaurants. know people engage behavior. $1400 meant top $600 received couple months ago. Making $2000. Yes minimum wage republican supporter. 

For single filers cut adjusted gross income $75,000 $87,000 gross income assuming standard deduction

For couples it’s $150,000 $175,000 gross income. 

About 9 million less people eligible $1400 checks, employed single person making $87,000- need it?
Or couple making $175,000? always mixed feelings quote, insult compliment?  Progressives wield power Joe Manchin wields drive legislation towards conservatism, correct.

The 'just us Democrats' roll pass even though stripped minimum wage increase workers desperately need, particularly time crisis record-breaking profiteering. Pandemic over, though. history scholar tell pandemics don’t end government says so, pandemics end populace says so. give money people spend it, hell think rich got way? Bezos get rich Bill Gates Musk buying Amazon... think initial conspiracies came from. locked modern world wanna collapse street. China open zero restrictions. stupid? bait, bait. 

We're baiting together comrade. supposed magically disappear? think there's disease virus goes Poof sudden. expected. forever, lift restrictions get people back working can't sustain life style government hand outs answer.

I'm ready go vote hell. Same. I'm sick people trying demonize want stop wearing masks mandates acting like we're evil human beings decided we're going continue wearing masks next 10 years lives virus completely eradicated world like small pox. 

I live state that's certainly going remove mask mandate safe vulnerable population vaccinated, already vaccinated. mandates over, I'm fucking wearing it. make bad person I'm going wear mask next years life COVID akin basic flu now. employee who’s quarantine 5 times already. Seems doesn’t care. tell miss customers?! :)

Yes, comes quite clearly. kind place would love patronize. suppose Kansas City area? Spain pretty badly effected virus. never understand people put masks going restaurant bar. They're allowed sit outside people walking last masks wonder spread bad is.

Also none essential businesses shut six. dumb law means everyone exactly time, usually hanging around maskless street corners. Get many vaccines people possible regardless used anti vax. I’ve got kid since it’s approved 18 safe relies many adults getting vaccinated possible. might number Americans 16+ harder number find number adults. Sounds like ignorant doctors there. told many times vaccines phase 3 safe. phase 3 trials every doctor burse wanted get in! sound different. know why. Education bad something?  household limit 160K, spouse make 160K? wanted there, indicative bloated garbage fought for.

Minimum wage increases aren’t finite expenses, entire stimulus package supposed be. Dude, scam.

Buy Snake Oil. Czechia oficially 1 dead per 500 mRNA unstable breaks fairly quickly cells finished using instructions  could definitely manufacturing problem. EU may made AZ rush vaccines quickly. Like unemployment extension, child tax credit child poverty half, state funding vaccine rollout, etc? Sorry putting money hand isn’t thing needed. reason estimates % vaccinated 18+ instead 16+? thought Pfizer approved 16+. think vaccinations teenagers 16-17 year old start June? wish shared optimism. someone repeatedly told paranoid thinking would still fight normal vaccines, I’m seeing writing wall. told young friends completely rational refusing even step foot grocery store. “not taking seriously enough”. worried mental health told vaccinated, obviously would well. Half vaccinated friends 20s still refuse anything indoors public. say don’t want make plans June feel much anxiety thinking crowd. really wish could believe you’re right. ## Every 60 seconds Africa, minute passes. I’m concerned variants “been months” kinda misleading. isolated cases different predominant variant. think people want pandemic really want things go back normal see many people getting vaccinated way out. probably feel like getting keeping us pandemic thus label antivaxx frustration. lot people would much rather take chances anything could happen vaccine keep living like this. Dang, facility sound like good handle infection control measures. rolling 7 day averages bullshit right snow power outages state. Nobody could leave houses get tests read post. I'm talking perception public, AZ's case already problematic, put mildly. see cluster? then? complete nonsense way get people board love exclusion hate. 

The fact they're coming around good sign may open say. go Rutgers positivity rate skyrocketed here. People dont understand pandemic isnt really wish I’d boss like waiting tables. You’re rare gem &lt;3 mondays schedule already made... Got first shot 3/3, issues little arm pain. Go back second 3/31 can’t wait.  led world handling pandemic

Utter nonsense... Based what? one successful countries? It’s budget bill COVID relief it. frustrates (and much touch on) going forgotten government did, even say begrudgingly, phenomenally well vaccine procurement roll-out.

It negate cronyism. negate unnecessary deaths. negate much know, country going remember one bright spot shower shit conservatism. Logistically easy vaccinate athletes....but question ethical would vaccinating. country vaccinates athletes, many countries behind vaccinations would think would pr problem. Japan, going even pr problem. Well good thing isn’t happening then. don’t want increased wages drive cost living vast majority folks making minimum wage. B117 variant doubling every 10 days. going stop? Still possible house say change something Russia shit, maybe sanctions etc - nothing major.  Nothing major attacked us 16

&amp;#x200B;

I would also say campaign working, based many people want it/are suspicious it.  Would also bet quite bit redditt Lmao, use? Ask doctor bandaid solution right you? product may cause bleeding intestines. 2019 made $230k together like prophecy, stashed big chunk savings find months staying home due pandemic. Yes. I'll freely give credit UK government procurement, although bungling EU made us look better comparison. also rocket science conclude vaccines way pandemics, case historically since vaccines first created. fairness though, quick act advantage advanced research SARS vaccine candidates original SARS(1) virus outbreak gave us head start.

Nevertheless credit operational rollout delivery vaccines millions people per week belongs NHS SAGE. Internally, UK government cabinet next expertise field.

I think also important remember PPE debacle pandemic first erupted UK: date 2nd rate equipment, shortages medical supplies course thousands unnecessary deaths care homes. generally effective dominant strain Brazil? CBS Austin forget numbers 2 weeks ago artificially deflated due nobody able leave houses? Nice! Hadn’t seen one. got second dose Pfizer days ago, I’ll happily part data U.S. really really bad post. Cases back New Jersey. Yes, rise them.

You know why? people acting like end pandemic. We're close actually ending via vaccine people acting stupid. want hope best, disappointing Wtf?? Common fucking sense news think mean ""unvaccinated"" populations. number people agree truly 0 relevance whether I’m correct not. AMC started 9$ straddle. Rolled 9 put 7 almost even trade lol. 

PLTR needs SPY green week. It’s ready rocket. Wow actually pulled through... time revealed broken two-party system is. say blocking I? EC would directly block production fallout. 
There whispering campaign Russian vaccine initiated various pharma. 
I take don’t work industry? combination robust vaccination program coupled natural immunity really bad infection waves past.  What's consensus may feel shitty vaccine, covid?

First shot fine? Second shot shitty? Right like 12 hours later?
