I'm guessing kids robust successful responses deep lung tissues defeat viral challenges initial infection occurs attempted, compared adults, robustness innate immune response particular tissue region wanes age, relying adaptive immune responses, increased viral load new variants enough overwhelm even younger robust innate immune response deep lung tissue, leading disease seen original strains. hypothesis. Except vaccine never gave immunity like vaccines do. point CDC officially changed definition vaccine this. 

And herd immunity? Fauci threw window months ago. 90% vaccination herd immunity? That’s herd immunity that’s full vaccination. 

We cases since vaccine rollouts deaths vaccine. What’s going on? 

Btw im fully vaccinated, people need stop kidding start looking numbers. hear “immunocompromised children” argument time. It’s OVERWHELMING minority population. comes point time need return normal ? wrong wearing masks? hating Singapore reason, lied ""hit hard"". Lol. hate neighbor Lou Gehrig pretty fit. Arthur Ash insanely fit. Rocky Squirrel I'm assuming fit. slippery slope. happens, it’ll smokers getting transplants, obese people getting treatment whatever else people charge decide. article Singapore. US. case pointing Singapore free vaccinations relevant saying US does. fuck even talking about? I’m pro-vaccine 3 covid shots. said multiple times.  allowed increase people's risk. 

just like drunk driving example... saw something similar shirt. ""Can't cure stupid, keep quiet (picture duct tape)."" didn’t see anyone outside household last Thanksgiving. yet, mandate vaccines time, can't go public school without them, know why? vulnerable children, teachers, staff family members risk.

what really afraid of, probably already several vaccinations life, scary? one cares pandemic made realize average intelligence is. always thought super average, B+ student, genius, form coherent sentences. HO LEE SHIT majority people stupid degree never imagined.

These people watched Back Future thought ""Hey Biff guy would make good president.""   worrying possible complications years COVID-19 kill near future. Btw chance dying COVID-19 vaxxed extremely tiny. I’m *here* this! average IQ Texas gone wish could upvote Funny, matched dosage horse version vaccine.    slightest tinge consistency world-view, reject two new pills insufficiently tested potentially nasty longterm side effects. Seems fair vaccinated bird flu? everyone got vaccinated, like messengers, mumps, rubella, polio, etc etc etc

we would enough herd immunity reduce risk overall people risk.

in addition, vaccination rates low, mutation ongoing early result new variation none us protected like that, POOF! one vulnerable.

don't understand point vaccination?

why difficult? 

it's vaccine, hell afraid of?  Absolutely totally agree !!! wasnt .. realize MRNA vaccines widely available free charge states? Anyone regardless race get it. actually racist black people prevented taking life-saving medicine? Sore arm it. amazing! felt absolutely awful mine. thankful wasn’t case her. think thats fair Didn’t already this? husband got booster last week Capitalism Depends  Yeah that's I'm doing. Saying live high risk living situation. true, live elderly parents take care 8 month old nephew often. Fingers crossed article says a, social media darling. prospect long Covid scares especially young ones. worry. may less cautious youngest get vax pretending things normal priority, long-term health is. Besides pretending things normal make things normal.   fat contagious? know is? COVID-19. many people don’t immune systems? According study done 2.5% country. That’s… roughly 9 million people? Across entire country. truly immunocompromised worries COVID, likely take measures things life. many children died COVID-19? According CDC less 700 since start pandemic. Less 700. 

Like I’m sorry comes point time “but children ill” argument needs reassessed. That’s true. 

Kids shitty immune systems don’t usually go hospital Covid. 

The problem “inflammaging”. 

Hospitalization Covid usually result enthusiastic immune reaction, called cytokine release syndrome, people become increasingly likely age. 

Kids don’t world’s strongest immune systems long immune system reasonably functional fight covid. 

Unlike Dad great uncle Joe whose systems experienced. 

Basically, body calls cavalry come pouring start stabbing everything sight. It’s ineffective it’s kind charge light brigade harm good. 

Hence “complications related covid” - aka “their body tried hard kill covid killed mistake” 

Kids young peoples’ immune systems aren’t powerful enough less likely end hospital. 

But. 

If use vaccine train powerful immune systems properly, give blueprints covid, show body works let strategize, teach recognize covid fight properly, many people would died cytokine syndrome instead mount good immune response.

These people need vaccine - there’s real for-sure way know whether body going cytokine thing get covid, that’s end r/HermanCainawards


THEN people crappy immune systems. give vaccine body can’t anything it. Can’t fight without army. 

 vaccine doesn’t help end hospital anyway. 

(Which masking social distancing around granny still needs thing)

They probably would died anyway - much old disordered immune system. nasty flu pneumonia would done thing perhaps. 

The people vaccine really save ones could fight flu cold problem, fight death get covid. pinned top. Masks help stop spread covid...but anyone seen group 3 year olds try wear masks doubts efficacy. Also IV might take hour administer hospital vs vaccine takes minute setting

why're people talking like drug vaccines mutually exclusive? still breakthrough vaccine; therefore, lean drug get through.  thing lose lung capacity never get back

that's they're saying, want able get treatment asap reduce chance something like happening. already are. control group.

It's working well control group.   Ah Wish family would read this. thought Singapore culture wearing masks too. wear mask even though I’m vaccinated. like masks much made profile pic. Number 1 mask man. like, ""How much would insurance company pay bucket lower middle classes pouring money into?""

Medical charges like used car prices. Heavily inflated, negotiable, always wait eons approval lower anything towards actual cost.  sucks Perfect enemy good enough. Deal COVID now, shit later. Extreme sports car accidents aren’t filling ICUs.  got mine yesterday sore arm minor muscle aches, I'm totally fine. super weird vivid dreams last night, though.

It’s like that. dismiss concerns, actually feed them.

They're right long term studies. Francis Collins said Lex Friedman's podcast recently. also said even though chances long term adverse effects **not zero**, long term adverse effects similar vaccines, there's reason believe different. given benefits, worth outside risk.

Their echo chambers filled anecdotal stories adverse effects. serious. fake, I've seen quite credible. mean vaccines safe compared Covid, even they're less safe medicine, without actual data, dismissing concerns convince there's cover up.

There recent study mice (or rats. Can't remember hand) showed intravenous injection concentrated vaccine caused Myo/pericarditis blood clotting. way guarantee intramuscular injection inadvertently hit blood vessel aspirate syringe injection. may explain blood clotting heart inflammation common young men vaccination. Bigger, developed deltoid muscles = blood vessels = chance hitting one. well studied, seems worth looking into. however policy many national health services *not* aspirate injection. Denmark fact recently changed policy, many others followed suit.

These concerns I've come across arguing anti-vax, conspiracy theorist friends. I've actually convinced get vaccinated. listening researching presenting reasoned responses. fair, took lot patience time would liked. convince all, better none, right? got mine 4 shots, 2 arm. remain facility 1 hr administered.  seems fair. question related article third booster last friday, get flu shot week must wait time different vaccine? mocked avoided like ark flood.  serious, even click link see that's fox13now.com worded headline?  Personally, I'd probably instead.

I clean crime scenes seen situation dozens times. frank think anti vaxxers really acting bad faith. Many fearful, paranoid apathetic (in Asian societies, would refer old people don’t want change status quo even it’s get vaccine). 

The fearful paranoid part prevalent outside US isn’t massive culture war vaccines. Every mainstream media outlet political party Asia pro-vaccine. culture wars associated it. far understand, risk severe allergy ingredients. believe immunocompromised get much protection vaccines, since using live strains virus, risk taking them. Take grain salt, I've able understand it. 48%? way high. Americans pay least something health insurance. worse part get hospitalized serious medical bills shit deductible. healthcare.

I wish would allocate taxes towards healthcare, education things benefit people. need half budget spent military BS. Like fuck sake, budget barely even takes care veterans. country joke sometimes (referring US)

People terrified ""socialism"" system bullshitted badly thinking viable option live.  can't even spell guinea pig. act like qualified scientists.

Pity ilk didn’t learn earlier   Okay, fox13now.com purposely worded headline way politicizes life-saving vaccine, OP compliant spread misinformation repeating exact wording. 

Anything else? country, state y'all. Thank much detailed info hilarious anecdotes well. Hope everyone family kiddos still well, thanks sharing experience   good news?  far know, came joke three months ago, gotten ""overplayed"" enough see people make it. upvotes tell people think funny.  surprised. tried tell mother discussing subject. Cremation toss nearest dumpster, care. apparently, that's illegal. Like reddit anything that, hah.

Who would talk like party, real?

You'd talking one real quick... Good, worldwide solution.  Think PEP works HIV: know exposed possibly were, go get course drug. sibling got *both* shots knowing fairly certain would cause severe reaction. did, times, received immediate help, told ahead time, life goes on, says zero regrets. wont risk covid know that's obviously way worse.

Some want survive smart even bad situations, surviving, double idiocy die....wild times. Thats interesting. wouldnt need prescription doctor positive test? might give people close contacts infected person? first two sentences made nervous. I’m glad hear uncle better. here's thing. people get stuck medical bill (in us) million dollars. street jail, rest us foot bill. id rather focus energy pre-emptive strike retro punishment. Thank confirming definitely fun parties haha  also werid way think feels safer planned world altering shit happen control overplayed used joke though, that's broken kind ruins it, definitely got it, clever, fit corona pig connotation, funny. Brainwashed right word. 

They've conditioned see ""The World"" (which different context biblically Ev circles) place controlled Satan wants destroy Christians, secret plots set motion destroy church. 

It's brainwashing, they've conditioned conspiratorial thinking general. republicans states closely related moderate democrats compared republicans southern states? hospitals must keep money humans policy. WELP. Crazy got vaccine. That's good them, hopefully keeping safer Covid.

I'm American familiar political faces states, quick glance political make-up (outside Governor positions) looks quite mixed R-dominated impression statement would imply. Originally, mostly addressing Texan ones mind course transfer totally across board. might entirely different reasons play here, like media slant social stereotypes, i'm going make air-tight analysis based observation youtubers. would like thank highlighting anomaly introducing nuance though, makes interesting. ""I calculations, boy bad math."" People’s foolishness punished though, whole point universal health care system provide social care, everyone, matter dumb were. speeding crashed, would still get free healthcare, treat didn’t get vaccine way think call doctors office explain situation shedule appointment vaccination sites, also personally talk doc. feel like want get rid call another general practitioner, dont feel discoraged first one turns down. run trouble also call local health authorities, countries also covid/vaccination hotlines call free charge. Generally speaking booster shouldnt problem take, might experience mild side-effects. So, would try re-try. really hard tie exactly one thing.

The Netherlanfs example removed masks early summer. Kids returned summer holidays late Aug. Restaurants relaxation seating late Sep addition vaccine test enter (loosely enforcered), cases started rising weeks that. 

Denmark however took 2 months lifted restrictions masks/entry, cases really start going up.

I think ita similar difference US states cases go one region fall rise elsewhere. weather, actual regulation changes, might cyclical patterns understand.  Per Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) used collect reports adverse events vaccination general public. primarily used identify potential topics investigate regards vaccine reactions. However, event data VAERS often verified often self-reported, assumed adverse events VAERS actually associated cause vaccines, possible estimate frequency adverse events data.

There's another issue tying-up resources. wife works local hospital intensive care running 100% capacity almost constantly since pandemic began. times 200% capacity. problem cost: hospital create new ITU beds expanding areas including operating theatres (which did), can't magic-up additional staff. result, they've taking nurses completely unrelated specialisms telling ""You're intensive care nurse now"". People died cared properly - that's criticism staff who've best can, inevitable circumstances.

At time, they've cancelling surgery capacity care patients afterwards, cases operating theatres (and staff) seconded intensive care. Again, people died receive timely treatment.

Finally, people would normally receive bed intensive care getting one limited capacity. unvaccinated Covid patient lying ITU bed 18 days blocking resource patients need it. look parents friends getting older, imagine I'd feel told get bed heart attack ITU us full unvaccinated younger patients Covid.

I HATE idea refusing treatment people - goes entirely values beliefs. However, even starting feel people actively refuse free vaccination rest country desperately persuading take perhaps expect free treatment predictable consequences refusal. communists' fault, lack trust comes shock therapy 1990s.   Religiously, believe covered. 
Medically , yes medically ineligible, bills paid full covid treatment long could take approval? optimistic thinking could end pandemic ""Cheap"".. least $5 packet covid pills.. wtf.   I'll agree this, also take Biden's statement signal intend extend deadlines court case pending expects favorable ruling mandate. He's effectively telling businesses get caught pants courts halted temporarily. someone Singapore, quite interesting development. one hand, step right direction unvaccinated make disproportionate number people hospital/ICU/morgue, they're contributing strain (rather understaffed) healthcare system, _the_ big concern moment. people support lot we're still heavy social restrictions healthcare strain despite 85% total population vaccinated, like getting back unvaccinated getting us situation, even though number pretty small now. others also support dislike tax money funnelled treat people refuse vaccinate. obviously free Covid treatment gonna last forever, end point.

On hand, Singapore comparatively low elderly vaccination rate, presumably unlike countries elderly see compatriots dying en masse healthcare overload, much push factor get jabbed. Despite government's efforts get vaccinated, quite significant number still refuse to, whether stubborn fear side effects due various health issues, distrust Western medicine attitude ""I'm ok dying I'm old"". Unfortunately makes convenient scapegoats especially younger generation feel like they're held back stubborn boomers (and older). elderly needing pay treatment, might decide forgo testing/treatment altogether, might see beginning die home, never looks good matter want get jabbed.

Anti-vax Republicans playing Russian Roulette base they're taking bullet gun turn. people claim love Jesus much, really know big man frowns upon putting people danger political gain. Also looks Croatia barely 10 thousand tests day Greece 200 thousand average day. baffling much Croatia undertesting.  Also apparently vaccinations effective mixed (There seems studies/data moderna, Astra Zeneca Biontech) Idiots research. That's reason. 

And politicians balls enforce stuff could help. vaccinated want travel Singapore also need prove health insurance covers S$30000 Covid related treatments there. Daily deaths 1211. health officials noted **latest curbs helped stabilize spread** Covid-19, ending pandemic possible reaching **herd immunity through** vaccinations **recent recovery virus**. 


Less 35% fully vaccinated, reaching herd immunity recovery means let Covid run population. 


I cannot imaging another semi-lockdown. hard months ahead. Show them/read them/give link.

That's do.

you lead horse water can't make drink. This... put smile face.

Edit: r/MadeMeSmile allow crossposts :( You...you realize booster trials started people already 2 shots right??  simple tools everyone possess allow 'think freely'. Critical thinking, basic numeracy scientific knowledge. antivaxx propaganda I've seen falls cursory examination. fact people still believe sheer laziness. totally U.K. would save NHS money free beds! Boris listening! really wonder brains anti-vaxxers anti-mandate people work. Especially ones acknowledge vaccine would immunize them, get vaccinated someone's telling to. This, me, sounds like young children playground going ""Na Na!"" they, five? particularly high risk, front line workers, brothers sisters blue dying, still resist. pray one changes public policy take away pandemic formal, proactive embrace science deciding factor, i.e. situation science discovered fact situation people's lives jeopardy, longer left individual choose whether adhere facts, contrast irrelevant opinions beliefs. advent advanced science, slight modification customary endorsement personal liberty enforced, i.e. facts situation known, facts make clear jeopardizing people's safety ignore facts, longer freedom ignore facts. gap COVID19 death toll red &amp; blue America grown faster past month previous point: 25 every 100,000 residents heavily Trump counties died Covid, 3Xs higher rate heavily Biden chose path, got walk too.   VT Republican Governors, yet highest vaccination rates US. Fully agree.  don’t believe natural selection true.  made snort. one also consider situation emergency care: People younger average previous waves also means tend stay longer ICU, leading pressure ICUs similar incidence numbers previous waves. 

Especially first second wave, many elderly people even made ICU. given palliative care. ended ICUs minor number somewhat younger people, smaller part number people dying. 

So, ICUs capacity quickly, result chances survival people need them, great anyways, go down.

This dumb. kidding. Especially grandparents won’t even get vaccinated grandchildren’s sake. son finally chance get vaccinated last week right number one risk exposure family refuse get vaccinated. standard everywhere. Singaporean here. get healthcare rejected Singapore, even unvaxxed.

You still apply government standard health subsidies (if applicable). free Covid, could go debt (your choice).

However, posters mentioned, government autocratic feel necessary. issue good bad sides.

Context: government tried kinds things target anti-vax crowd. Campaigns plead get vax. Restrictions dining out, congregation services, attending weddings.

Mandates vaccinated work offices buildings Jan next year (else work home only, pay testing). Travel restrictions outside Singapore.

And STILL anti-vax folks spreading fears disinformation. SG public (on reddit least) reasonably favour this, onerous mask, social distancing restrictions lower death rates, people fed up. sad horrible.

So, anyway... alone America, everywhere, Europe (and everywhere else too). That's neat thing propaganda. feel like propaganda. feels like ""I done research, toob dot com""  fully vaccinated, chance dying COVID, vs. *prior* chance dying Flu? 
 
**Long Version:** Let's say 2019 got flu vaccine. lived life normally, right? Presumably thought chances dying flu low even think it. Even someone Flu sneezed face, would probably live, what's big deal. \[unless specific medical conditions, etc.\] 
 
So 2021. got 3 Moderna shots. chances dying COVID-19? Even unmasked/infected person sneezes unmasked face? \[I know depends potential co-morbidities age, low-risk group AFAIK.\] 
 
See mean? go back living like 2019?  *not* living normal life *not* following science?

Saying politicians one things save lives may leave hated is... entirely forgetting saga ACA passing, even though Democrats knew would get slaughtered next election. made difference. Here's one anecdote (""walking plank"" section): good politicians there... people often vote they'd rather get short term gains feelings coddled.  thousands idiots occupy ICU units, proper tax payer may find spot ICU another terminal disease. accept this. Idiots pay decisions. Votes. OSHA requires businesses follow safety rules *all time*.

For instance, limits much weight office worker carry without asking help and/or using lift belt proper training.

Exact heights safety railings defines fall risk.

Thankfully seems govt somewhat prepping case ever happens. I'm glad Tokyo's bit back way go bit now.

Useless amount people *actually* can’t vaccinated absolutely microscopic percentage.   guess Japan isn’t “sick control measures.” MANY prime medically vaccinated.

THAT'S trying protect.

geez, read history vaccination get back us. rocket science. Maybe mean sterile “clean” 😂 whole hesitancy past months overblown really. anti-vax rather hesitancy. initially hesitant co-workers got moment us office got vaccinated. asked why, said lot vaccinated gave confidence take one too. Nobody wanted get Covid.

It also helped govt local testing vaccine used build public trust vaccines.   booster, breakthroughs even minuscule. ✌🏼

Life pathogens. Life risk. always always will. wear mask stay home rest life, enjoy.   they're called breakthrough infections they're transmissible.

that's. why. masks.

ugh way. vaccinated still go hospital still die, high rate. know someone fully vaxed died weeks ago short time hospital. last heard, vaccinated still make 20% hospitalizations.  lot community transmission, beneficial community (and individuals) start getting benefit second shot three weeks rather 8-10 weeks even ultimate immunity level higher. Well one: one: 

Either meet basic outline describing; constant surveillance system tracking collecting data citizens would tolerated countries generated huge backlash Singapore.

But neither article thinking of. Looks like system ish though. Here's fix shit. curious Japan long history vaccine hesitancy

It that, hesitancy. confidence safety almost 0 opposition taking one. fact huge demand supply issues early on. happened office Tokyo, ones waited bit taking one already took vaccine moment us office got one. asked one co-worker it, said wanted verify first safe fact us got one already gave confidence take one well. Lol rate queensland wont even open domestic border.   know someone job. Ever. Again.

i reading replies ins ripoff .. YES sure .. sorts ways deny  claims   prescription horrible 

now referring USA companies   

IF DONT LIKE VOTE POLITICIANS  ... get rid government approved vaccines, people less hesitant get vaccinated

Yep attest this. hesitant co-workers took vaccine moment majority us office got one. Confidence numbers bit silent peer pressure made really good indicator others also take it.   public. trials booster shots like initial vaccine.  Others made covid political, therefore unreasonable expect answer that's political.  don’t know expected.  Should’ve faked birth come dont yoou think emp little biased  ... research It’s holding responsible choices. fair, that's literally insurance is.  don’t know mustard one. Reducing stopping. Please learn words saying contributing disinformation campaigns, thank you. mandates still important don’t want high numbers cases circulation virus. Also pills aren’t perfect, make huge difference it’s 100%.

Edit add: also need time using vaccine seeing work real hospital settings. science completely supports wear masks third dose. may exceptions - they're required course, transmission levels unsustainably high, around *very* vulnerable people. thing lose lung capacity never get back. young might big deal, get older really going wish still it. imagine mom ,rabid cavewoman 😐   went bar birthday party weekend West LA. strict us.

The guy door… “y’all vaccinated?”

Everyone - “yes”


Door guy - “ok enter. wear mask buy drink don’t care do.”


Everyone - “ok thanks” impact policy decisions? Surely, vaccines drug, risk COVID breakthrough deaths low enough need burn time political capital vaccine mandates.  Good! time! cover bills people infect too!!  Wasting concern mustard? Well, Ted “I’ll take vacation Cancun instead literally anything help state disaster” Cruz criticized it, I’m making mandatory.

Though, generally also make pretty easy opt one. article titled, ""Life Covid-Zero China."" That's pretty darn misleading. I'd almost call lie.

The fact Ruili repeated lockdowns known long time. secret means. getting attention plea mayor, secret came light.

This norm China, NY Times misleading readership thinking is. says booster shot, could speculation. Perhaps booster tends cause stronger immune response due already memory gets triggered antigen. Mr. Snuffleupagus gonna take Ivermectin even things out.  Good. general industry 100 employees? It’ tough year cartoons fictional characters. last part music ears every person born last 20 years haha know horrible wish would bring states. U.S. looks every way screw people medical bills anyhow, might well capacity may get people get vaccinated reduce surges hospitals. people still don’t want get vaccinated it’s “free county.” Cool. get consequences actions others don’t pay actions well. know I’m simplifying still. well. Basically reaction either dose. couple migraines first dose sore arm. Almost nothing second dose sore arm. Cant get booster till May next year. right stop transmission completely... help. Saying ""the vaccine stop transmission"" correct. reduces significantly, definitely get it. say “high risk field”. work paid 5000 get mine. already cool thing happened. Remember Singaporeans get sick control measures wearing masks. Singapore govt declares covid endemic. it. agenda behind questions? Also, hilarious think Singapore ""hit hard"". seen global news? Thats surprise, course business taking $$$$ denying every claim can. lying start pandemic

There's evidence this, read report yourself:

* 29th December - 4 identified cases unknown disease Wuhan, old SARS

* 31st December - 2 days later, China tells new disease.

* 1st January 2020 - next day, China shuts Wuhan seafood market, 

* 7th January - China identifies Covid-19 (sequencing), nobody knows exactly spreads. 

* 11th January - FIRST death, comorbidities. 20th January - China confirms human transmission 

* 23rd January - China takes unprecedented step locking entire city (Wuhan). cases grow, China expands lockdown multiple provinces. 

* 26th January - cases grow 100s appear across country, China completes unprecedented step locking rest country 1.4 Billion Chinese. literally shut entire economy 2 months stop pandemic transparent shared information had, able obtain confirm it.

Let's also cover fat people health complications manage weight? regularly exercise guess deserve medical coverage.

Why refuse coverage anyone smokes drinks vapes? 

Oh injured motorcycle? discovered slightly speeding car accident occurred? Sorry risky activities covered. 

Its beyond moronic anyone thinks good idea needs give head shake. Feels like none countries ever recover Communists fully century. living state high risk living situation. may true. However, many things needed better besides encouraging vaccination. That's one big problems significant may conservatives, pro-death plaguers. feathers, scales.

COVID comet.  definition irony Darwinism, also believe in. 

I'll bet believe Karma either -- Bible. still get medical help covid related pay normal already subsidied government rates people already paying pre covid. longer get free coverage government anymore covid. Anything else pay normal rates.

There’s initial inflammatory stage, often fever difficulty breathing part presentation. people get better this, like respiratory viruses. people end scarring lungs (fibrosis) consequence inflammation get superimposed bacterial pneumonia. Either cause worse oxygenation. Plus, best treatment severe COVID dexamethasone, steroid, acts anti inflammatory suppress fevers. 

So it’s uncommon us see initial spike illness (with fever) followed prolonged respiratory process, characterized decreased oxygenation. patients get better second phase, although it’s prolonged recovery (and don’t really know many people truly, fully recover). Others linger ventilator, unable weaned extubation due persistent hypoxia, eventually another organ fails another overwhelming bacterial fungal infection sets in, die.  several dedicated local groups people reporting kids fared helping find vaccines.

Tribalistic wanting tribe survive. It’s propaganda it’s much true two doses 6 months apart. IIUC current dosing optimized lowest time effective level protection (6 weeks), still considering safety, etc. pandemic raging, docs optimize fewer doses highest level protection.

They also save money dying earlier (since state pay pensions).

In US someone get tested, wait, get results, decide whether sick enough, get doctors appointment, get prescription, get approved insurer, get prescription filled.

Likely gets used infrequently far later should. much deaths earlier pandemic. Therefore deaths showing now. 

The elderly, need vaccination most, ironically obstinate.

What getting at?  oh no

anyway must lot fun parties. actually know someone 60’s got Covid booster, flu shot shingles shot day. tired two days fine now.   anti-vaxx calling essential medicine human horsedewormer?  Nah, work, influenza virus.   12 weeks AZ doses got Moderna booster last week one way ticket aware fact WHOs list essential medicins humans? nonsense!?

Sad see state (Minnesota) bad. keeps getting worse worse! :( still treat them, free. Jacobson v. Massachusetts would like word you. law, simply incorrect. secret? Everyone knows businesses asked cover desire get everyone vaccinated. Safe Harbor that. Good them. Seems like random people handle COVID.

There's obvious risk factors increase hospitalization mortality, beyond that, still seems like roll-of-the-dice.

Best luck in-laws. terrible disease I've watched second-hand -- wife worked ICU nurse whole thing.

We unvaccinated family recently. get monoclonal antibody treatment ASAP positive test, seems useful getting positive outcome, seems far less useful hospitalization. 

Obviously, vaccination still, far, best preventative basically everyone... 🤷‍♂️ OSHA lot safety rules comply with. regulate ladders use (and do), can't regulate this? look source report, mostly emphasizes conclusions data Sept. 4-Oct 1, although toward end throws analysis back Jan 15 (which useless comparison, mention). stupid news outlets -- Axios included -- pick eye popping result. Sep 4 - Oct 1 data interesting Delta variant circulating, around time 50% Texas population fully vaccinated, including much 50% risk elderly people. still seeing 13x unvaccinated deaths stark difference. They're vaccinated. Antivax rubes ruling class. Doubt it. vocal right champion left demonize thinks politics joke. dosent care either side. Prove Ted Cruz muppet, dare ONE antibody titter.

He'll probably run office eventually. Maybe misunderstanding you, really making Texas look bad look good (in fact deaths similar California: see effect vaccine has, January much unvaccinated people there's today.

The infection rate though would also affected taking taking vaccine, also people around vaccinating, wearing masks etc. guess that's Texas 13, California 6.8. lot pills, far widely consulted moron medical issues - opinion vital  frustrating havent fixed yet, expect fix Nah, they'll find reason bad horse dewormer good state pass CA deaths soon Vaccine doses finely calibrated - generally need be.  takes large study judge efficacy single dose level generally aim highest tolerable dose.  good-sized trial 50mcg Moderna booster dose produced good immunity.  

Moderna announced studying lower dose levels could well ask drop dose primary shots 50mcg (same booster) even lower.

There also studies lower dosage Pfizer (15 mcg instead 30). Nice try. attempt “gotcha” doesn’t make sense second sentence false. fifth sentence also false attempt.

Well, think heart disease cancer much dangerous. Police irregular working hours. Poor diet sleep contribute heavily, higher levels stress potentially. logic number cops killed every year gun fire like .005%. guess stop caring like want us stop caring Covid killing cops.

You correct, major issue significant amount resources dedicated it. Assuming % quoted accurate. guess stop caring like want us stop caring Covid killing cops.

Correct. don’t want get vaccine wear mask. refuse both.

(Assuming businesses enforce number sound like theyre not) may workforce doesnt solve change fact still get infected spread others. even people miraculously grew brain everyone get fully vaxxed end year, still wont enough. 30% Vermont's population (150k) unvaccinated causing surge. even 99% country fully vaxxed may enough. Well... could useful, COVID seem spread much via surfaces. Plus, already lot simple effective ways clean surfaces. 

The ability kill aerosol viruses interesting, require light intense enough distract blind.

It's interesting paper, really useful method yet. Moderna 100 mcg, Moderna booster 50 mcg, Pfizer 30 mcg, Pfizer (5-11) 10 mcg.

If male 30 high side effects earlier doses probably get smallest possible dose. ~60 surely opposite. 50,000 people quarantine sounds like lot small country, negligible number 1.4 BILLION people, completely reasonable remaining 1.4 Billion people free go lives without heavy restrictions. 

Because counts low, China able deep tracing identify test contacts, get isolation become dangerously infectious. 

And yeah, cases coming asymptomatic people quarantine becoming symptomatic. China really good job preventing broad infection. people print cards? seems much difficult. Yes don’t understand article I’m tired might why. capitalism..... Nuf said \~March 2020, China better reporting country earth, basically ZERO domestic transmission, ZERO infection, ZERO hospitalization, ZERO deaths. maintained hard border mandatory 14-day isolation quarantine, caught asymptomatic cases entered ZERO Covid general population. 

When something break through, brought massive (PCR) testing tracing bear, rapidly identify isolate infected individuals major outbreak occurred. 89 cases ""large"" daily number China. 

With Delta, harder transmission rate high. spreads faster, takes testing (10s Millions tests) time (~1 month). Nevertheless, China contained least dozen Delta outbreaks far. 

Because China successful experience stopping outbreaks spread widely, continue so. 

In mean time, rational basis claim otherwise. fact China largely free cases evidence enough numbers good. India showed, simply possible hide Delta outbreak. vaccinated death rate standard illness like flu, strep etc. isn’t much left done. People aren’t gonna lock wear masks didn’t before. They’re also likely unsympathetic simply won’t get them. kids taken care of, happening now, isn’t much left do. 

I mean packed football games mostly vaccinated folks hardly anyone getting sick. Rogan possess anything past GED? look controlled immunity previous infection unvaccinated group.

I'm *clearly* recommending people skip second dose. I'm stating looks like least protection days first dose second dose. They’re going really pissed find C-3PO R2-D2 pro vaccine too. Singapore getting hit hard delta variant? wonder Japan isn’t getting hit delta variant like Singapore is? ""Strong male alpha lion takes beating Covid, realizes he's stupid delusional"" vaccinated individual whose kids go vaccine required school. Half dose Moderna still regular dose Pfizer. Yet ethics penalizing people wrong choice concerning forgone conclusion That's what's dangerous it. get vaccine, reverses causality retroactively kills descendants. Earth used 31 billion people, people taking vaccine, we're 8 billion. NYC past weekend vax proof required every indoor dining place Broadway show. There's digital version app super easy quickly flash go in.

The word strict dumb, either mandate not. mean one spewing hate people aren’t vaccinated, thought would fun join hate you. infant son (9 months) tested two times daycare COVID outbreak. took doctors office 4 weeks confirm positive COVID. legal action take given put lot people risk? said first time failed follow-up test results, I’m frustrated lost. giving nebulizer system seeing lungs wheezing 5 weeks refused treatment didn’t COVID…. That's default ... everything.

I honestly can't wrap mind around this. f*** ever politicize vaccines? global pandemic? stop, you’re blatantly dishonest putting words mouth. problem can't eradicate stupidity especially can't eradicate people making stupid choices, even looking back see wrong. civilization reduced interactions strictly mutual benefit would end it. Healthcare human right, yet many patients suffering ailments denied healthcare thanks covidiots hogging ICUs cause stupid listen doctors first place.

Maybe rethink REAL oppressed party spout rights, hmm? Well, know born shithole, becomes *your* shithole.

Do really want abandon shithole? Well, ok, yes do, abusive relationship shithole.

Honestly combination fact is, all, home, people can't leave anyway. could barely afford it, maybe, I'm middle class *and* recent European heritage use get citizenship.

Link source please, thank quotes article: ‘ “Now CDC [Centers Disease Control Prevention United States] ordered vaccinated people die result COVID recorded unvaccinated,"" ‘

I wonder long take American anti-Vaxers start claiming this. said ""most people hospitals vaccinated"" true country. arguing random nonsense, shifting goalposts.

Also less 1% people get hospitalized covid, even amongst nonvaccinated. tourists right now, don’t think know people feel Japan starts opening again. article states Singapore. think NYTimes presenting town someone got desperate enough speak publicly. also present primarily border town problem. Also IV might take hour administer hospital vs vaccine takes minute setting. Dose production also limited compared vaccines. Weird, weird conclusion. Good luck you. No, fact, people breakthrough infections two Pfizers gotten this, pushed hard enough. Long covid resulted. way underused. People already go hospital covid unless shitty immune systems. saying anything. thanks, know three shared think people stopped paying attention IMHE model long time ago. almost impressive many times wrong. otherside wishes everyone suffer die? Right, right, got you. Noted. agree election last week signal warning current government thatCOVID fatigue real people tired it’s time way out.  To;dr? make big thing pandemic well managing great threat America, we'd still suffering misrule. ""There tide affairs men...."" doesn’t change anything said. know people haven’t paid medical debt, credit score went down. house car still. Got treatment still. go on, What? covid bills I'm healthy person. PA looking end school mask mandates January. Hoping NJ follows suit. Tired masking preschooler. I’m Georgia Rt lowest ever remained way. We’ll see winter brings, right now, good news. Oh yes. Let's that!

America needs universal healthcare. Corporate America gives bills pay. 
Cheerleading nuts cheering bills unvaccinated. Like idk, unvaccinated evil reincarnated. 

Once again, universal health care thing, maybe 200k people alive without vaccines. 

Phatetic! true however ethics second come question  500 deaths. population 5.7million. Yes, vaccination induced antibodies waning, thats need boosters. covid deaths unvaccinated 14x higher. spikes observed world due Delta variant. asked, explained. need that. /s  words anti-vaxxers ant-maskers, afford COVID? willing lose house, car, prove point? Singapore. point impact US...once insurers turn back unvaccinated health risk. Tbh, Trump office, think propagation virus would bad globally. Getting rid CDC staff China, weakening US's position UN &amp; certainly lot China able deny initial spread first place, got play along. Also trashing pandemic play book another blunder committed past administration. Things could played much differently. Attn: Ontario?

I like idea this. Good Singapore. evidence Chinese government supporting them? 

In actuality, Chinese government provides support lockdowns, ensure people get food, medicine, etc. China actually good this, afford lockdowns limited scope.  project Western abandonment people onto China. 

What complaining lockdown itself, wanting basic support, 99.98% China back normal, accident geography makes impossible Myanmar (Burma) fully-vaccinated. That's odd. reducing voter base. like 25% parents wanted get kids shots immediately, us one them. It’ll definitely cool within month.

Also, like you’re saying there’s lot initial delivery woes leading people running around booking multiple backup appts making crazier seems.  Right, good arguments too, Delta outbreak 246 people (31% unvaccinated children, age &lt;12) emanated 2 children (solid red squares, G1)

What really mean I'm fence narrow issue. strongly support vaccines, strongly support vaccine mandates, strongly support childhood vaccine mandates generally, strongly advocate 5+ year old get vaccinated COVID, trial showed good results.

I'm complaining see COVID childhood vaccine mandates right either. 

I understand perspective someone cautious jumping directly trial mandate. Thanks EUA, data millions doses age group pretty soon.

Honestly ""immediate"" impractical right anyway. pharmacies area appointments 5-11 right now, I've checked. able get appointment hospital. Ah. You’re American

i'm mean rest world government pays healthcare.

there ""one"" system rest world uses Even would still bullshit. end Rome wasn’t world war. collapse major world power. 

If something similar happened now, US federal government would essentially collapse various states would left devices. US would pull military various countries around world, destabilizing regions. That's fascinating, state would actually better everybody smoked despite objectively bad people. makes wonder they're even pushing vaccine since covid disproportionally kills pension earners heavy healthcare users. we’re end times? Everyone knew breakthrough COVID asymptomatic sinus congestion felt could worked  85% crazy? Pretty sure we're around Canada too. least among eligible population. mean (in that's what's happening. Businesses wanted government bad guy first. know bunch federal contractors work, dirty little secret companies willingly agreed modify contracts almost instantly federal workforce mandate include vaccinations. Even mandate overturned now, contracts legally binding. mechanism federal government able force company modify contract- need companies' support that.

Most companies sick dealing covid. vaccinations turn down, even bit, they're it. Got booster two days ago. high risk. Got Walgreens. don’t ask questions majority people refusing vaccine. Businesses lots workers work indoors home seems pretty much criteria covid spread. Hardly arbitrary. forced outdoor workers WFH people tested vaccinated well, argument. excluded. disagree, happened VA democratic candidate pretty average. NJ, voter turn abysmal, Trump's loss lot republicans came vote. Based NJ's 40 year history, NJ supposed turn red again, larger % lead seen VA.

My understanding PA end year, we'll see 80% total PA population fully vaccinated, currently 1-dose 79.8% (12+ population whopping 92.2% 1-dose). Given covers large chuck country's impacted age groups, preempting lifting masks bad thing, like can't roll back lifting mandates another surge occurs.  Many police think rules dont apply them. goes lot shitty things do. Also, people dive head first concrete likely die try land feet. Texas dont care. Watch couple live streamers there. mask social distancing large gatherings throughout pandemic. One coughing sneezing months, Obviously sick. Still mask.  Especially Delta, covid spreads far easier flu.  Ah. You’re American. don’t mean America this. Americans already pay way much health care. mean rest world government pays healthcare. one graphic looks misleading bit. 3% cases among fully vaccinated, 8% among deaths. Graphics like often intentionally misinterpreted antivaxxers. extra explanations. what? Trolling? think OK :)

I honestly think hate masks greatly exaggerated, though.  heavily populated areas, points contact much people &amp; higher concentrations rural areas… dipping slightly last month, seven-day rolling average positivity rate 8.5%. state reporting 47.4 daily new cases per 100,000 residents. number also declined last month trending upward Health officials reported 4,253 new cases COVID-19 Monday 34 deaths, one Isanti resident 20s. Got mean, that's major issue journalism science, delicate wire walk trying make statement related actual lives impacting meaning intent study. case scientific wordy would much better, simply explaining data collected recently Delta far prevalent. might valid point picked misogyny instead transphobia.  parents would let get vaccinated covid... :( "" contagious Delta variant surged across Texas.""

Was specifically referring axios claim chose period Delta surging despite opposite happening period. Agreed that's unlikely researchers cared catching surge wanted data Delta. okay it.   I’ve got several friends ended pretty Anti Covid vax really right leaning. pointed status saying “if really support police, help make sure get go home”

And grand total 0 “Blue Lives Matter” people interacted it.

Next day curiosity, put status favor businesses travel requiring vaccination got utterly flamed them. 

That told don’t really care people themselves. Great decision, meanwhile Romania f#%ked antivaxxers..  definition word ""Duh"" Delta still prevalent strain, study meant analyze deaths infection surge, meant get updated vaccination/non-vaccination risk factors Delta strain covid-19 region, gathering data end surge issue all. comment repost bot? seem quite often enough trigger reply-guy-bot.. can't wait see mental gymnastics justify taking new ""barely tested"" (/s) covid pill instead vaccine anti vaxxers.

EZRA KLEIN: is, ways, big question, think falls really says lot we’re targeting policy. **If vaccinated, fully vaccinated, get Delta, outcomes compare getting seasonal flu?** 
 
CELINE GOUNDER: lot people compared Covid flu. clear, Covid flu. **through vaccination, could turn Covid something like flu, yeah, might get bit sick, might feel well enough go work school, might feel sort achy nauseous, bit fever, sniffles, don’t end hospital**. vaccination, could turn Covid something like flu. 
 
EZRA KLEIN: there’s leaked CDC document Washington Post got. document behind change masking guidance. got out. it’s terrifying lot ways. page three, set charts, they’re comparing, based data have, outcomes infection, hospitalization, death among unvaccinated vaccinated. point charts you’re eightfold less likely get virus you’re vaccinated. you’re 25-fold less likely hospitalized die. 
**So you’re getting fatality levels beneath flu.** seasonal flu 0.1% terms many people kills. number holds, recognize change, means vaccinated, coronavirus risk level, seems, comparable things simply live with, like flu. 
CELINE GOUNDER: **If anything, risk death, vaccinated person gets Covid, much lower somebody gets flu**, who’s one people doesn’t get yearly flu shot..................  No. COVID isn’t anything like common cold. Sure, there's difference ""you lie one care"" ""it's everyone"". Especially since many people qualify likely assuming read qualifications carefully, hear FDA/CDC think need booster, go way get one.  son getting first covid vaccine today I'm delighted. Thanks, science! 

Thanks everyone posted updates pediatric vaccines year. really helped. wrong. Everyone doesn’t need get COVID. would think is? We’ve seen beginning COVID systemic disease taken seriously. can't focus field

That’s point here. Yes please make $20 pill cost $2000. Someone thread kindly gave link information know government/taxes paying uninsured folks covid care. afraid hospitals taking hit financially many probably insurance. Still time that, least unvaccinated, start paying.  Dose dose weaker, yes. still valuable resource worldwide since account roughly half dose production. Countries used lots them, especially mixed vaccines, generally good outcomes (Uruguay may best example, many 2 inactivated + 1 mRNA). bluetooth though right?

To honest kind trust google facebook etc harvesting data government, facebook etc treat valuable want others steal ahahaha ""If going crime may well organised"".

However government app debacles woeful.  Exactly this. matter balancing tradeoffs. get high immediately effectiveness raging pandemic giving two shots quickly might balance worth even need quicker booster. Coronials? Good!  Thats horrible Im sorry. Contact lawyer. possible lawyer know sure. Many injury lawyers consult free.  cause* Yep. That's great analogy. 

Goodness. Vaccinated paying anyways? difference. Pre-Delta, fully vaxxed dropped cloth masks stopped wearing KN95s them. Delta picked switched [Dr. Puri found they're comfortable cloth masks, wear one without cloth mask (I mostly wore cloth ones liked prints lol). Dr. Puri masks really soft compared KN95s KF94s tried.

Thank info. administrative standpoint, accept prior infections gonna run two groups people:

Not NYT. West hoping China suffers mass outbreaks death like America. ghoulish nakedly evil. 

If China let virus run free, result would like India. Excess mortality suggests India suffered something like 5 Million covid deaths. repeatedly containing covid outbreaks, that's something China willing accept.  See reply 2 articles wired magazine.  It’s subsidised taxes think. Exactly. virus difficult kill surfaces either, seem primary source infections. guess point seem likely add much arsenal virus thanks info.

Man, still depressing though. absurd comment!! also lived Tokyo, thankfully never got covid several friends YES went hospital high fever days, weren’t tested, sent back home. 
And again.

To experiences. imagine big deal tell businesses 'change 3 lightbulbs LCD-123x stop cleaning surfaces every 5 minutes' :) even bigger deal kills virus air, and, say, reduces transmissions even 10%.

Definitely. possibilities effect works integrated normal lighting low cost anti-viral measures. study surfaces, neither body air ... preliminary. Right now, would quackery, but, hopefully, studies quantify effects multiple conditions (if/when).

I imagine big deal tell businesses 'change 3 lightbulbs LCD-123x stop cleaning surfaces every 5 minutes' :) even bigger deal kills virus air, and, say, reduces transmissions even 10%.

Of course, also imagine working, still half stores saying use :) Stating West incompetent propaganda, absolute fact. MILLIONS Western people died unnecessarily West refused manage covid-19 properly. richest country earth still 750,000+ confirmed deaths, that's complete systematic failure due incompetence. 

As claim failed Wuhan, that's completely false. China locked Wuhan rest China within week confirming human transmission, stayed locked months, outbreak ended. That's successful pandemic response got Zero Covid.

What's truly pathetic Europe America months prepare, nothing despite seeing lengths China going stop disease. dying :-) immunocompromised got vaccinated stayed safe could, still got somewhere.  Yes do. makes happy, go it. “news” bubble feeds supporting misinformation. Link broken hope US moves uninsured unvaccinated covid patients paying least care. There’s reason America country made Breaking Bad.

We get healthcare free Australia (which lot charged US) we've already paid *with taxes*.

Yes numerical rates bit higher much less likely spend several times net/gross/total we've ever earned ever get sick future treatment. Nope, system, like guy said.

I think two leaders, necessary people knowing good power. necessary better outcome future may look good short term people, many hate them, would anyway probably well aware would hurt view. However, power like Trump make look good short term advance themselves. while, caring long term outcomes actions.

A leader locked country hard save lives would hated upon many, yet people may lost lives otherwise. long term outcome also giant economic burden survived can't work need disability. much cost country? Many revere Trump economy none thinking future problems created. problems blamed later presidents too. good leader believe would rather hated know saved lives loved live blood hands. 

Our political system flawed people care advance party instead thinking long term advancement people. infastructure country failing according many engineers, ex Levees.

it quite stark. 12x risk death unvaccinated. watch ""news "" channels vaccinated hosts tell thr vaccine dangerous. whole thing cultish.  Actually IQ smart Texans gone down. Average IQ 100 definition. Pretty sure that's want - sacrifice alter Trump Die free, die early die dumb Except we're refusing treatment, stopping completely free. still get treated, still get beds, still standard subsidized public healthcare rates pay reason might need go hospital.

If go regular family clinic, still going $10 consult+meds+test. Except positive, go care facility hospital severe enough. pay per normal. selfishness causing people suffer. Glad sibling okay. Bad reactions vaccine real, reason wait 15 minutes leaving vaccine site. 

Before get let say 100% PRO VACCINE. got booster, actually.

A former co-worker mine known health issues, unexpected severe reaction vaccine week getting passed away. [Her case made world know odds happening infinitesimally small terrifying something rare happens someone know. Everyone everything right nothing else could done. favor getting everyone vaccinated am, know would say family ""it time.""

I even like telling story, anti-vaxers quick jump it. someone knows anaphylaxis clotting issues, really need take extra precautions.  Things even relatively quickly. Approving new age group creates bump demand. One thing also found curious NYC two anti-vaxxers know took kids shots immediately, mostly they're ""muh immune system"" sorts think kids risk adults (they're... know... wrong whatever gets kids jab).

Of course city giving 100 bucks everyone including kids gets shot, month Christmas, probably nothing sneeze either. One two specifically posted FB she'd lose nerve anyone mentions 100 3 children lol. like us, still profit. can't pay 100% medical bill it. Someone still crippled financially something medical. CDC's list bullshit. Boosters open all.

A lot people getting boosters know should. 

The FDA/CDC left lot confusion general public. theory could people anti body treatment vaccine?

A need time waiting window treatment, eventually able become fully vaccinated.

I’ve also heard people certain allergies found way get vaccinated premeditated medical intervention careful oversight doctors. sounds awful lot like brainwashing. systematic process pressuring someone believe Radically different context world... That’s added 3rd full dose immunocompromised August. lot data showing 2 doses weren’t providing enough protection, immunocompromised must 3 doses considered “fully vaccinated.” Apparently COVID cure it, cause guy least admitted wrong apologized happened state zero COVID months total 9 deaths COVID Flanders (Dutch speaking part Belgium) 93% vaccinated French speaking parts Brussels bit lower, cases deaths managable. Portugal 98% flatlining cases deaths since March. 

Hard compare 1 1 might give reference terrible someone telling something protect them.   Joe Rogan needs stick bald MMA. fact every celebrity stick noses respective fields avoid giving """"""medical"""""" advice. huge echo chamber.
Should choice, simple.
All people discourage people getting vaccine 🤦 say whatever want. CVS, Walgreens, checking anything write form fill out. ah, see. yes - them.

They're also going lose minds learn federal seatbelt laws.   Oh no! Anyway.. cares case rate california? highly vaccinated areas. Yeah... long-term gains hard get people see. good example covid seems like hard mostly lock mask 1-2 years get vaccinated. social circle know anyone died covid. hear places entire social group family basically slaughtered that. even seem like much long-term thinking planning, since pandemic immediate danger imo.

Yeah, agree vaccine mandates. get political already have, think also infrastructure bill bit since necessary expensive long-term. Whereas certain presidents mailed checks name them, actually helpful necessary time hardly something that's going help people one year ten years now.  Insane. Surely people recognise isnt logical? intentionally infected cows COVID found they're pretty resistant it. 

Same pigs chickens course though, minks transmit well Ahah yeah stuck born countries sucks... curiosity, Donald Trump one?

I'm surprised covered government.... US Health system lol. shoes, happy either. Well, want so, could count Australia island nation. China? US occupies smaller Island....

And, countries shut travel. Taiwan NZ example simply introduced mandatory quarantine, measure less severe US did, blocked arriving foreign travel longer time. people thread commenting good, get deserve want remind everyone spreading people who's bodies can't fight off. dinner buddy night tears. mom vaccinated wore masks still intubated ICU cancer last year spleen removed. body literally fight COVID condition, even though got vaccinated everything right. unvaxxed dying, yes, also taking vulnerable them. available? Texan getting booster next week - I'll relieved get upcoming holidays. Since family get together last year, everybody pushing make happen year. me? mean them? reply much informative. Bingo, 100% certain booster would need longer time (some vaccines don't). certain people dying incredible rate needed vaccine ASAP. made right move 3-4 weeks doses clear might come expense long term protection. awful one go this.

Truth.

This heartbreaking hear every time happens. really good interesting point, respiratory viruses presumably transmitted across groups animals long humans began living indoors... big difference Florida cases turn hospitalization deaths. people saying outdoor transmission increased Delta wear mask crowded spot? trust numbers coming Florida covid take Tylenol now. Blaming vaccine side effects don’t take simple step mitigate bit unfair.    them. infect people make vaccination decisions children. terrifying precedence set.
Next - fat people diseases caused overweight, car crashes driver fault, drink spiked cause partying hard notice. I’ve clinical work primary school (K-2) one students announced yesterday got first dose shot Sunday. It’s happening, everyone! I'm eugenicist. science behind that, historically, decisions whole groups people die turned well.

Do scientific evidence people done anything useful lives? “Demand booster shots fallen expectation California. infected Californian increasingly spreading coronavirus people; Saturday, computer models estimated every infected Californian spreading virus average 0.96 people; number rises 1, set stage growth pandemic.” Good question, short answer:

The virus multiple parts, need stay don't. target parts need stay same. changing parts allow virus faster/better infect humans, thus delta dangerous.

(Please downvote question; answers need visible. ¢¢) Florida's 35% cases per capita. report - Honestly, Florida following fairly cyclic pattern covid past year. 2 months low cases followed 2 months high cases. that's happening still debate, several areas around world experiencing similar pattern

Learning history OSHA Act, department labor, exciting journey you.     no, thank yours! mandates. I'll give somewhat pass island nations shut travel (totally unrealistic western world). said, COVID going run thru countries point. There's covid zero pretending created boat load issues. So. do?  inline. live small town Massachusetts seen multiple anti-mask, anti-vaccine, anti-mandate demonstrations center town. people everywhere get kids vaccinated fast enough. virus never going away. Never. reality. need wait December. Look Arizona right now. Up, up, away go numbers. medical staff screwed rest waves (Delta holiday one). Everyone unsure works, since farm animals appear spread it, might deer receptors spike protein works quite well, possible receptors/cells even prone infection, innate immune response upper respiratory tissues much worse fighting infection even low viral loads, combination two, compared humans. appear humans sufficiently low enough viral dose lungs upper respiratory tissues mitigated cleared innate immune responses, even without developing long term memory based immune responses. possible humans slightly better defending low concentrations, quite good particular threshold, thresholds met concentrations allowed larger, like indoors poor circulation, long term face face conversation.  I'm sure right, new vaccinations primarily going kids boosters. Especially Merck Pfizer pills coming, vaccine resistant going even less scared COVID already are. Hope good access healthcare though cuz get pills quickly. young, issues \*your\* risk tiny (roughly equivalent flu), \*you\* could go living like 2019 (I'm sure different, I'm pretty much same, except masking public indoor spaces, mandated area, abundance caution). BTW, would rational, 2019, wear mask, try avoid multitudes flu outbreak zone.

This mean \*everybody\* go back 2019; lot mandates designed protect everybody, society everybody (and, sure, many staying due inertia, may needed many areas). 

So, abide local mandates (don't a-hole), otherwise, \*you\* live 2019. Friend mine’s son leukemia. survived COVID thanks compassionate use auth monoclonals. He’s 7, can’t get vaccinated immune numbers come enough mount reaction, he’s delayed it-hopefully weeks, thread effects chemotherapy treatments. horrible, shop that, like many those, one hot crazy girl at?  terms considered eligible, experience CVS: person administering boosters asked blue needed one said at-risk group severe illness (which true). didn’t ask anything beyond able get booster. spouse got CVS without asked eligibility weeks later.

CVS another pharmacy might better option level anonymity don’t physician. IMO they’re less likely hem haw eligibility. referring indoor deer. really guessing, since read literature 

But imagine almost every virus existence able sustain outdoor transmission-- viruses existed concept indoors created, right? 

For humans today, ""outdoor transmission"" usually like ""If spend 3 hours people outside, risk?""   
But animals early humans probably meant something like ""If spend entire life outside people, risk?"" 

I'm guessing duration exposure matters lot. Spending time infected individual means getting larger dose viral particles, right? That's breakthrough went. Nasty flu-like symptoms week plus days feeling like hot garbage. I'm grateful could work home comp time accrued, otherwise I'd screwed. Correct, everyone eligible yet. remain vigilant holiday season stay safe. booster I’m still going practice safety guidelines worked family. safe !  Let's go Big Bird! assume everything illegal places legal US. people charge seem sense respect human life. Indeed tough compare, even European countries among difficult compare different approaches, peaks, strategies, etc. look proof concept. European countries 20-30% higher vaccination rates Southern US states, also different approaches, still seeing new peaks. Immunity via infection not, that's still millions people ""fuel"" virus. Without doubt Southern US see another peak. Haha, ok recognize comment\^\^ maybe deer frequently making   Sucks nurse Texas. Aside that, keep dying! probably important note effective date January 17th, least we'll two whole weeks clear holidays. get require vaccinations school, I’ve never seen requirements one social event. 

In addition others said, we're transition period, vaccines likely requiring childhood vaccination COVID sometime future. vaccine requirements measles right now, almost everyone vaccinated measles. Sometime later, hopefully, particularly strict COVID vaccination requirements going movie, almost everyone vaccinated.  trust numbers Florida though?  One days employee sue employer mandate (failure provide safe work space) employer face two competing suits   willful.

Agreed think goes past aggressive ignorance. sort weird flex, like ""oh ignorance triggers you, oh okay **snowflake**"". Honestly, may next time. got booster I'll traveling around holidays otherwise would've probably skipped it. want go again. reaction severe J&amp;J lasting much longer sure. I'm 48 hrs still feel like crap.  'everyone Florida dead'   Oh man, I've exchanges anti vax morons link papers say *exact opposite* point trying make. clear either bothered read paper yelling read, thick pigshit, actively propagating disinformation know 99% tools little bubble also bother read papers  way avoid something like this...   well florida, 16,000 residents already dead covid. probably good time boast successes, might residents already died, you... seen fully anti-vax thing, anti-this-particular-vax. Think they're silly, really one I've talked fine rest.

Not sure that's better worse guess. Thanks. actually issues COVID related well potential Christmas plans involve much fewer people nearly 30 last Thanksgiving house, easier. I’ve never seen requirements one social event

Many cities started requiring proof covid-19 vaccination things like indoor dining, bars, etc. would consider one-off events.

I think perfectly okay extenuating requirements extenuating circumstances, like virus spreads easily indoors severe potential health also timeframe that? Shouldn’t requirement recent vaccination many age groups? prove already antibodies, really need vaccine? Someone prior infection good vaccine development could easily better protection older vaccinated person doesn’t develop protection well.

Slippery slope fallacy. Practical limit vs theoretical best; things done within practical limit achieving theoretical best invalidate worth practical limit. Nothing mentioned incorrect, practical best verifying vaccination status now. information shows overwhelming reduction risk vaccinated. zero never going zero nothing measure addition guarantee zero balance diminishing returns.

And things already evolved re. full FDA authorization initial vaccination passage vaccine mandates, things change boosters go transition. already request period boosters existing vaccines diseases, reason can't true covid-19 prove already antibodies, really need vaccine

Having active antibodies indicate strength immune system response upon exposure, demonstrated many months effectiveness vaccine upon exposure virus trigger adequate immune response high, even 6 also think arbitrariness broadness rules makes ridiculous times.

Requiring people engage various activities known elevated risk spreading virus show status something known reduce risk spreading arbitrary. think missed competent literacy (which fair, plagues lot America). show morons articles/studies even abstract explain antivaxx bs wrong fairly normal language adult. they're *so god damn inept* reading anything social media garbage bottom barrel ""news"" words abstract make zero sense them. saying uncle contracted CWD eating deer meat? aware possible. 140,000 kids lost caregiver covid: part infuriates every time pull ""99.xx% survivable"". Yeah, I'm sure statistic extremely comforting kids. ""Good news kids. Yes, know dad died, gonna leave crushing hole heart rest life, mom's gonna take second job see much, able afford nice summer vacations, summer camps, probably able afford good college education (or do, saddled crushing debt next couple decades), fact probably wont even able afford current house gonna move away school friends, whole host issues. good news is, gonna survive fine covid (aside potential lung damage, brain fog, lifelong guilt think killed dad)"" Meanwhile Alabama, took 9 year old Saturday CVS. appointment noon. first pediatric dose gave store. one else waiting appointment. (None local pediatricians giving Covid vaccine storage capabilities. thought rush first days least... wrong.) covid pill pfizer working quite encouraging. 

it's pretty clear going get thing personal responsibility alone. know already people actually get sick suddenly trust medical care. they'll take pill. something could prevent this...

Have tried prayer? I’m happy keep insinuating people idiots doctors prescribe also idiots. know point zero efficacy it’s scam it’s related politics.  vaccinated, worried about? You’re right three. (Un)vaxxxed. Boom chicka waw waw. godson older sister got weekend. local school system setup vaccine drive weekend get many kids vaccinated possible. guy stayed Holiday Inn last night. Thanks doc Moderna started much higher dosage level Pfizer. variety reasons chose route takeaway likely Moderna higher rate adverse reactions time Moderna's efficacy infection lasted bit longer (they started higher point). 

Cutting half brings closer Pfizer's dosage level (though still bit higher) means terms antibodies generated fully known time. data boosters showed full Moderna dose producing significantly antibodies Pfizer's full dose, seen data half-dose yet. Much like others said, case rate doesn’t tell us much though. I’m sure pro is. 

Just case rate higher doesn’t say whether people getting severe disease mild disease.

California almost double population Florida. (39.6 mil vs 21.6 mil) things equal, almost makes sense California double amount cases.

You pointed excess deaths Florida vs California. (60,418 vs 72,811). Again, things equal, deaths double despite cases double. shows California Californians done better job protecting California worse outcomes. 

At moment I’m worried next wave. certainly prepared last winter, Europe next surge makes think aren’t far behind. Got booster week ago, two slots booked addition mine maybe 20 whole day, across days looked at. people went also getting boosters. Anecdotal evidence doesn’t seem rush get vaccinated like first released public, I’m guessing everyone made minds point they’ve eligible long time. Unvaxxed causes real problems communities around them, situation good case point. work locksmith go people’s houses regular basis. vaccinated take precautions keep germs myself, mainly immune system suppressed. customer early last week front someone sick unvaccinated home time working testing positive despite vaccinated taking precautions. 

Because immune system suppressed, cannot build kind immunity normal people much get sick something I’ve vaccinated against, it’s usually severe. I’m 100% certain would ventilator right hadn’t mitigated risk beforehand. great feeling. youngest got vaccinated Friday. bunch shot clinics week school district shutting Friday teachers get boosters students get vaccinated. We're finally light end tunnel phase things. Hey, I’m staying optimistic!

Those rural counties small populations, compared urban suburban areas. you’ll notice, urban/suburban areas often go blue. believe point next ten/fifteen years, Texas may turn blue. immigration tech industry booming, could happen. Don’t give us! 

We haven’t drank Kool-Aid, still need reasonable people vote blue. classic predator/prey cyclic relationship. predator voluntary covid interventions prey sars-cov-2. prey, sars-cov-2, dies stops feeding fear media coverage predator, voluntary covid interventions. voluntary covid interventions fall prey flourishes again, leading new supply media coverage fear feed voluntary covid interventions.    not?

The fact BD specific species animal particular cells virus infects blessing curse virus. blessing enables virus become EXTREMELY efficient infecting particular type cell. curse provides structural limits much ""shape"" BD change dramatically impacts ability infect target cells. such, virus can't wildly evolve take shape wants still cause infection, play within chemical/physical realm receptor BD targets. that, protein structure relatively easy cells make. hypothesizes one ways Delta evolved produces higher viral loads one mutations makes protein easier cells synthesize, increasing number virus particles cell make. 

Now get question. virus operate within constraints, evolution occur BD remain structurally similar previous versions. means, cases, antibodies still going bind pretty well BD. Furthermore, immune system always monitoring see improve antibodies target. slight mismatch, immune system detect refine antibodies producing target mutated form. far, encountered variant sufficient enough mutations significantly escape antibodies produced vaccine. 


Now answered question, add little bit information immune response generated. Along antibody response, also cellular immune response. cellular immune response includes number different immunological pathways enable one maintain long-term immunity also provide ""already trained"" immune cells ramp moments notice respond future exposures virus. latter set ""already trained"" immune cells often determines ""how sick"" get breakthrough infection occurs. Basically, infection gets foothold cells ramp wipe wide spread damage. case current vaccines, even though evidence antibody response waning, little sign cellular immune response waning (around 10% mostly elderly).


In long run, years wear exposed multiple times (with without infection), immune picture likely evolve combination aggressive cellular immune response coupled high levels localized antibody production mucous membranes. much analogous number viruses exposed childhood and/or vaccinated childhood. time adults, immune response mirrors description described. drew blood, would see antibodies blood stream high number mucous membranes. horse dewormer

Last April, Deborah Birx, MD, coordinator White House Coronavirus Task Force, said asked people COVID-19 die preexisting conditions: “If someone dies COVID-19, counting COVID-19 death.”

. statement, combined state health officials saying follow policy, sparked charges COVID-19 totals inflated deaths diseases *even auto accidents* victims happened COVID-19. Federal state governments gradually altered policies spring summer say order death counted COVID-19 death, disease played role.

Seems like exact definition changed bit since beginning pandemic. Uh vaccine wears off. probably soon right ?(got mine like late spring) whole thing ? Millions people set appointment get vaccinated we’re going around unvaccinated waiting get next round vaccines ? workplace safety? seven states State-level OSHA agencies take precedence ove

State OSHA strict Federal guidelines. States typically right police things stringently. 

The issue federal mandate overreaching constitutionally reasons raised above. Since public health enumerated power, states set rules, Federal restrictions relating public health pass much higher level scrutiny.

The problems using OSHA mandate are: 

\- OSHA typically workplace sphere influence, catch COVID anywhere. catch work too, like dangerous chemicals would deal work OSHA traditionally deals with. kind clunky argument say risk COVID work.

\- People returned back work year states mandate coming OSHA indicates ""urgent."" One could argue Biden new president, he's also office months ""urgent"" enough put place January took office cases much higher.

\- Another issue people work remotely office required jobs. one areas rule could narrowly tailored. 

\- practical issue using OSHA courts struck OSHA rules recent past. 5 last 6 struck down. Biden administration knew this, bit head scratcher decided use OSHA rather method this. hard pressed make question least 5% would say believe something silly. work differently it’s complicated. basically PCR test tells you’re *infected* antigen test tells you’re *infectious*.

The PCR test positive antigen test. 

It typically takes days infection antigen test positive virus accumulate system become infectious. antigen test later negative enough virus cleared system. point PCS test, looks different things, still pick traces virus positive. Even accept proposition people shouldn’t required get vaccinated “freedom” something like that, kind fool thinks it’s bad children’s show encourage children make good choices including getting vaccinated serious disease. reason oppose you’re mad makes “freedom” posturing look stupid. bad.  surprisingly, professional researchers tend aware stuff appears first chapter experimental design textbook, ""gotcha!"" replies top internet discussion thread study ever tend wrong.   First, gonna need source 1,600% figure. 

Second, excess deaths can't explained people tested positive died. We're still undercounting. describing happening. However, classify ""exaggeration."" Exaggeration implies intent mislead. reality, errors, they're exaggerations. law  unnecessary thing mention article breakthrough infection. think author shoe-horned project image cultured date current social trends.

Weird stuff.  important important question whether breakthrough infections serious enough require hospitalization. cases much less common, 400 confirmed COVID-19 breakthroughs went develop severe illness. And, again, data show similar pattern waning immunity. rate severe COVID-19 among adults 60 years age older fully vaccinated January 0.34 cases per 1,000 persons. rate severe illness dropped 0.26 cases per 1,000 among vaccinated February 0.15 cases per 1,000 vaccinated March. researchers report number severe COVID-19 cases among younger fully vaccinated groups small draw conclusions

So vaccines work, confer sterilizing immunity, protect serious disease. designed. Glad see continual data supporting safe, effective method fatality prevention, humble intelligent enough use it. clarification. State level rules take precedence Federal rules. supremacy clause constitution forbids that. However, exception state level rules may *more stringent*. States cannot go federal requirements, there’s nothing stopping going beyond. [citation needed]

[Basic understand contributory causes death work needed] There's probably also support big number unvaccinated either medical issues prevent it, idiots get killed. home antigen tests show false negative results. PCR says positive Covid. home tests less reliable. take qurantine serious dont come contact others. Get well soon. Yes, side, Kim Kardashian keeps putting places called at, like demanded stop execution man killed two innocent people 1999. would tell her: ""b\*tch keep useless mouth shut, father managed get killer streets roam free go suck Kanye's schlong"". trials Valneva vaccine carried 4,000 patients aged 18 years older

That seems awfully small considering trials mainstay vaccines currently carried patient groups around 30,000. Yep, that's another good one. Really, switching rhetoric *anything* mundane non-controversial really showcases insane people sound bad arguments are. Better data not. Yeah I'm sure that.

Maybe I'm grumpy old man good lord guys writing style insufferable.

That's hell lot words tell us breakthrough infection. factors go %. 50% adults vaccinated, would less 95% protection, based data alone.

Still good idea get vaccinated, course. Here’s I’m statement: it’s really sketchy best. I’m fully vaccinated, got booster too. whole family vaccinated, kids getting next week. don’t believe second CEO medical company best interests population mind. It’s profits. agree message misinformation vaccines major problem repercussions, guy particular isn’t person saying 100% agree. ""hey, guy lining pockets money refers oppose criminals"". 

This easily fuel anti vax movement. Seatbelts airbags  part TN, CWD testing deer mandatory. process deer processed results come back, hunters know wait results cooking eating.  thought, least last year, free got hospitalized. dream this? yeah, kinda scary someone gets who’s 20-30s (i’m assuming). hope best, make case still get vaxxed extra protected. I’m there. hospital system pre-COVID, don’t want get flu shot? Fine. gotta wear mask. falls apart though people anti-vax anti-mask, I’d say 95% time they’re one same. case, political cost high death numbers would outweigh economic benefit. country that's developed enough state pensions universal healthcare, government let virus burn population would inevitably lose next vote. 
 
Trump arguably lost 2020 virus did, deaths US (IIRC, around 400k time election) fraction would virus allowed spread completely unrestrained. Dude Jim Carrey favorite actor, he's antivaxxer loon.

Also, Letitia Wright stay away talking vaccines keep nose making Marvel capeshit films.  least know *tried* get vaccinated (his wife two adult kids vaccinated, many arguments), actually came around. really hope late. coming guy eliminated department company studying cure Parkinson's. we're crystal clear. talk 7% actually believe microchip vaccine.

That's... pretty high probably silliest claim list. don’t fully disagree you. specified further. patients tell story, went social gathering close family, refuse vaccinated. They’re going concerts, weddings, raw dogging masks public areas. hermit family/public rest lives absolutely sure they’re safe, sure, yes. reality won’t happen. It’s almost 2 years COVID, people tired, lives, bills pay. It’s almost unrealistic immunocompromised perfectly safe point time. 

In context common anti-vax talking point, “if you’re vaccinated vaccine works, worried me?”, scenario depicts people get vaccinated. real risk causing harm someone else. 

If someone gets hit drunk driver dies, blame victim road? No, blame POS decided get plastered, drive behind wheel car, kill someone. IMO, antivax different. They’re walking public health risks don’t care hurt sake narcissistic ignorant beliefs. laws prevent releasing patient identity medical setting. HIPAA sure maybe others? Hefty fines exposing patient doctor recorded sound ER.. basically bunch alarms patients going critical near death.  do??? Agreed. 

I care much people’s actions know know better. It’s like smoker day age lot aware unhealthy choice smoker 1920s. 

This last brutal FL surge number ways calculated handled way deliberately reckless. going “look rate”. Yeah let kick shit gross level backdating deaths every moment looked like end massive spike even ramping exponentially. here, I'm Missouri. We're known smart. ahhh damn thats unfortunate wait someone big right denounce new drugs people reject treatment that. *laughs already got booster* No, wife made appointment Saturday, get first shot *today*. went tested positive yesterday. Probably something antivaxxers getting consequences actions Oh dear...

But curious, say someone ate meat animal coronavirus, infection spread way?  nowadays celebrities often ""field"". People used follow actors, musicians, artists, presenters, DJs etc.

Exactly, mean, like overused word ""**influencer**"" used describe anybody whatever shit internet without specific field, ranging people scream like idiots FDAF hogs mukbangs Kim Kardashian-wannabes whose skill show butts net.

Everybody ""influencer"" nowadays, type willingfully spread nonsense need go f-themselves. anyone heard info vaccine 2-5? Pfizer supposed submit data late October? I've scouring internet can't find update. might also give pass sure simply care stay date vaccinated.

Like husband told literally Googled “Which booster get?” LOL Can’t help notice certain people telling shut play football way players speak certain issues. 2020 fucking wild It’s misinformation, it’s statistics. People don’t die covid counted covid death, that’s going leave mark death count. map workplace safety? seven states State-level OSHA agencies take precedence Federal OSHA rules specific area publish rules. serious challenge occupational workplace safety 43 states. He's CEO Pfizer. course says this. CEO pharmaceutical makes ivermectin would probably make equal opposite statement spread truth drug. one seems understand virus doesn’t care. doesn’t. Bad bot. totally relevant. ""reasons"" seemed largely anger Biden announced booster plan FDA review -- issue FDA scientists Marion Gruber Philip Krause quit. last act positions deny booster general population retribution Biden. Krause's letter Lancet outlining reasoning boils to, ""Gee, others need vaccines us? protection death good enough, protecting symptomatic illness (which rough ride even lead Long Covid) -- meh, really cares, taste smell able climb steps without getting winded, overrated. mention Marion 65 therefore making eligible boosters? Peace out, USA."" (Paraphrasing bit here) Rogan prime example. Incredibly boring. can't believe I'm saying this, even Kardashians seem put little effort stupid crap drama. Rogan shows rambles. LOL @ drug company CEO calling someone else criminal southerner, wondered folks immunocompromised do. nurse health made impossible me, honestly, bad been, probabaly would went back work durring early pandemic today. watched horror people disregarded fellow humans lives, causualy disdain. suprised seen last, oh, maybe 5 years (you know I'm talking about). 

Being nurse before, see people worst, also best times, hoped pandemic would bring us together. (Ha!) Anyway, year half watching nurse's eyes, knowing effects would various groups medically vulnerable, averaging least months finally catches attention general population media, finally seems like everyone getting around wondering nurses. done point. 

I quite medical problems rare. I've putting surgery since May last year, first fear catching virus, know even best times conditions require extra attention anymore. tired beyond sick b.s. 

They watching, waiting people step start right thing, take care vulnerable. Watching people take precautions, themselves, others, turn around scream able save loved one, ""lying"" diagnosis made virus. lauded heros maybe 5 months forgot them. knew plenty left nursing well virus hit, honestly financially profitable hire least amount nurses legally possible work like continuously. thought things bad before, give years. 

So, back saying went tangent, thing think immunocompromised living South likely move north. People going change, going get vaccinated, going start caring them, get hospitalized, nurses going able give specialized care need. Unfortunately, state American healthcare, people kinds conditions going financially able move. sit around, waiting open eyes death. Oh agree this. vaxxed? least wear mask, wear properly. completely unreasonable anti-vax crowd expect immunocompromised stay home, work never go public. still work run errands, like easy find solitary job. That's ""poorly"" relative term. Sure nowhere near dangerous cramped indoor space, mean can't spread outside like people seem think (or least act). Deer highly communal seen spread outdoor settings among humans engage similar close proximity behaviors outdoors. They're also including ""not sure of."" woman partner plans get pregnant pregnant, sane simply know anything whether pregnant people vaccinated care. couple others, *might* also give pass sure simply care stay date vaccinated.  article interesting. almost felt like author really wanted share ""awful"" Covid story fit people actually terrible time Covid. basically cold thanks vaccine. Luckily get kids sick. feels kind preachy like he's telling us ""we're wrong"" reality many us even eaten inside restaurant kids vaccinated yet. (Well vaccinated. son got days ago, we're pretty excited it.)

I issue vaccinated people whatever want do. put much effort, job protect anti-vaxxers. guy regrets putting kids danger hope learns it, end day pretty much non story. scheduled vax appointment testing positive..?  good, deserve get stupid, selfish assholes ethics consideration people awesome! said, there's line cut guidelines who's eligible almost staggeringly broad. go get it. :) Biologically close it. also pointed 20,000 Florida's 60,000 deaths occurred since June 1st *this year.*  Correct, J&amp;J mRNA vaccine. plan crawling woods never seen I’m near dead. medical care family, too. good friend mine joined wife could treated cancer without bankrupting them. AFAIK, American turns booster principle, shot put plane go person developing country deserves more. get thrown garbage. American simply ends wasting resources rather misusing them. Progress imply final destination. lived another day today, ""total"" age intending reach? live day immortal?

Every death disease prevented win, hope continue winning COVID (and diseases) indefinitely. Ah, makes sense. 

I'm still waiting getting booster (it's scheduled week, thank God), I'm getting nervous due rapid spread. friend mine (who fully vaccinated JJ, including booster) recently exposed unvaccinated person work, wrecking plans meet week in-person, cousin mine (who get vaccinated) nearly died weeks ago got infected. I'm assuming that, effectiveness vaccines waning, vaccines still highly effective illnesses result hospitalizations deaths? Stockholm syndrome. here. point guidance isn’t helping best family. fair headline clearly curated incite panic. ""Why vaccinated before? always felt strong, among people COVID nothing ever happened me. idiot, taken good beating.""

Well least knows. compound works preventing/reducing replication mechanism virus, it'll useful immunocompromised.

Per late stage, better early infection exists, there's still benefit halting replication heading ICU stabilization higher success rate. It’s likely true given garbage source. Yet times CDC rated Rona airborne (versus 6ft droplet radius), revoked statement less 24 hours. kind garbage source this? Never Montana? Lol   issue vaccinated people whatever want do.

I do.  certainly could before, responsible vaccinated unvaccinated sure.  also can't pretend over.  self-isolate like 2020, going unmasked indoor crowd situation still really irresponsible. endemic levels yet, may months we're there.

Anyone isn’t able vaccinated take precautions. translates behave? don’t know. Isolating much would make insane, everyone tolerance level. 

However, roommate nothing wrong. She’s vaccinated moving life.

Examples given include going mall Costco hang group friends different households. concerned may unknowingly bring home would pass one clients. context, friends fully vaccinated too.

Is risk concerned worrisome since vaccinated continue mask? ""This in: Texans unprepared [insert emergency here]""

Literally headline ever need Texas. third vaccine dose game changer. Already got appointment. States low vaccination rates catching immunity right infections. Vaccines children coming.

By end winter left last significant covid wave behind us good. 

Until then, brace yourselves, healthcare workers. feel sorry gave go due unvaccinated people. stop carrying life. Lucky American guess  Even could totally suppress good (I doubt it), largely think cost wouldn’t worth it. It’ll endemic thing think within year US live-virus nasal mist? every one claims independent, profound thinker.

Ask know.  understand, costs something like $30000+ treat unvaccinated patients end ER Ontario, Canada.

What means 80% us *did* get vaccinated, wasting tax dollars ignorants don’t “believe” science used keep dying- instead people need treatment serious diseases unrelated Covid (and immunocompromised *literally* can’t vaccinated). addition every one cases puts healthcare workers everyone around risk.

I think actual justice, opting getting vaccine mean opting universal healthcare system (or countries’ equivalent). People can’t ways, it’s absolutely absurd. might thing going Big Bird going far. already went Mr. Rogers. people shame. People willing die cause remarkable testament human gullibility willingness political party kill power. read comments somewhere Reddit several people said finally able conceive vaccinated.

More 180 rural hospitals closed since 2005, people living rural areas 20% greater death rate pandemic. Hospitals medical centers short-staffed begin with, burnout – temptation higher pay cities – led exodus experienced health workers. Smaller hospitals often don’t budget hire expensive travel nurses. 
 
The remaining hospitals often far away don’t offer higher levels care like intensive care units, many larger hospitals full can’t accept transfers. it’s hard rural residents seek early treatments like monoclonal antibodies, typically offered specialized infusion centers. types health access also worsened pandemic, rural residents lacking access high-speed internet telehealth visits vaccine appointments. 
 
There also disparities within urban-rural divide. Across US, people color likely get sick die virus white people. disparities even pronounced rural areas, according recent study. Living rural area person color “double whammy”, said Kwadwo Boakye, co-author study. 
 
At start pandemic US, coronavirus often seen issue facing cities. first four months, major metropolitan centers like New York Los Angeles called refrigerated trucks handle overwhelming crush deaths, virus mainly spread close quarters metropolitan areas.

The first US broad public vaccine mandate enacted United States 1809 smallpox. Supreme Court 1905 famous case called Jacobson v. Massachusetts upheld government mandate required smallpox vaccination.

The thing isn’t mentioned much cops people likely wear mask. Cops interact many different people day. don’t want get vaccine wear mask. refuse both. 

Finally, cops get paid extremely well. Many deserve pay. family’s get big payout cop killed line duty. really hope don’t get payout die Covid contracted job. would like paying family cop killed refusing wear bulletproof vest. Indeed, huge advantage Pfizer something like billion? doses given already. fact Pfizer vaccine proven work well adults critical getting pediatric trials first place!

But mean medical treatment children simply small adult treatment. Literally medicine studied separately pediatrics good reason.

And even among adults, already know demographics matter Pfizer vaccine alone.

For example, possible trial could captured risk myocarditis males aged 18-29, rare side effect. That's say get vaccine (they **absolutely** should, risk myocarditis **much** higher COVID alone, nevermind COVID risks avoided vaccine).

But statement ""We learn nothing trial rollout particular demographic"" true.

Note: said, again: getting 5 year old vaccinated... evidence right very, good. Vaccination rates still aren’t great  probably right Conservatives:

Healthcare 😴

Climate change 😪

Infraestructure 😒

Dr. Seuss 😡

Big Bird 🤬 Vaccine allergy 1 400,000 chance. considering mRNA vaccines JnJ vaccine share ingredients (outside sodium chloride, I'm pretty sure nobody allergic to), chance allergic *both* mRNA *and* JnJ vaccines 1 160 billion. 

No, that's hyperbole, that's real number. since 8 billion us Earth right now, actually extremely *likely* single person alive allergic flavors vaccine.  lot places deer eat hand. Factory farm conditions much higher risk animal human transmission among wild animals. think culling going solve anything here. LA Times article today. Blue California hospitalization rate 7. Red California rate 20. state average 8/100k. LA Bays infection plateau last weeks, interior is, again, rising.

It everything vaccination rates. mention exciting part - buried mass graves soil sandy contain bloating bodies started coming ground like massive decaying vengeful mink zombies. Wtf sounds nice, capable that, maybe would weather protected power equipment 2011 incident instead nothing end suffering another outage due weather. looks it, people charge already forgot still putting things place prevent incident future. folks come pat backs Infront 🤣 Prediction: They'll wait O2 drops, mostly late get benefits. they'll beg pill. given them, keep almost none hospital save dying.

Then we'll articles there's life saving drug covid one taking it.


We thing monoclonals. Still really it. We're actually using (a year later), frequently administered much later course disease be. think fault tends fall patients slash public health system slash health system. think doctors probably screaming ""why, why, tell got positive test I'd ordered monoclonals?!"" days tested positive coronavirus, went buddy’s house human-tolerant deer neighborhood. That’s started cough. went back inside deer passed area coughed at. Serious topic can't help laughing question 😂 Deer sleep top warmth every guy, right? also sniff others noses constantly.  chose pic girl almost kissing deer article? fired. 

Got Heebie Jeebies looking pic. 

\*shudder\* pill treatment much stop spread, it? assume take pill diagnosed COVID, spreading virus days? way.   wonder realize constitution gives supreme court authority decide constitution says, determining something constitution requires looking decisions (and courts keep saying things like OSHA fine). need research. easy 1,2,3. Yes, poor kids grandkids lose unvaccinated family members Covid? Texas surge peak cases early-September peak deaths late-September. Sept. 4 Oct. 1 perfect period capture disparities death related surge.     first read asthmatic lions. test positivity rate? California tests way Florida bet.

A Delta wave killed everyone Florida helps too.  *Ice-T shambles* article aside, Singapore definitely Central East Asia. many experts weighing this. Good show experts. I'm surprised even reporting data. Can't cases e reports. seems that, decades, Sesame Street trying indoctrinate children living healthier lives, caring others, becoming better people overall.  


How DARE they?!? 60,000+ (minks) slaughtered en mass, 2020 due human-to-mink back human transmissions.

I hope see among deer. would transmit easily humans humans habitually sniffed other's noses close. free-dumb people get.

Vaccination, lack there-of national security issue.

When country like China force population vaccination, much powerful position. Troops vaccinated? Navy vaccinated? makes weak. Whole ships infected time. Standing armies force. Private supply lines choked sick workers, forcing inflation costs. 

A powerful country position would stupid take advantage make move others.  places much insular cultures. China also fine authoritarian leadership ways west never would. places still COVID, endemic everywhere. 

Nobody thinks west perfect, everything vaccinations holding vaccinations. available, endgame (+ improved testing ways improve treatment). people take it, that's shame. vaccinated, spread going happen feared. Jacobson case state govt issuing mandate, federal govt. Public health matters traditionally local/state govt issue. It’s different sphere analysis it’s federal govt imposing restrictions. founding fathers feared powerful central govt resembled king leaving. Whether federal mandate Covid vaccine good irrelevant considering constitutionality mandate. 

If California requiring mandate employers would likely fine. Congress passed law requiring employers mandate, would probably fine too. executive branch issuing runs afoul number constitutionality issues. Triple vaxxed, still masked always indoors crowds. 

It's end game kids eligible.

Dark Darwinism, are... Yes, though can't blame people here, blame a-holes refuse wear mask get vaccinated.  fuck coughed deer??  curiosity, Donald Trump one?

I'm bit confused here. mean? trying jerk.  honest though, ones stupid, actually quite erudite. think explain everything stupid/smart scale cases, speculate really plays biggest part primacy effect spectrum information exposed to. EXACTLY !!!  quite hard hitting campaign UK last January's lockdown. also billboards people PM yet running around hospital photo ops without mask Covid forgotten, still here. Well feel bad Josh. Absolutely fault. took risk gambled lost much ego pride, way stopped caused damage others harmful mindset.

Another similar case happened Flippo Pozzato, Italian former road racing cyclist. recently got COVID he's serious condition, regrets gotten vaccine earlier. hardcore irony he's junkie trusted performance-enhancing drugs (doping) trust vaccine.

Let's hope cases serve warning idiots purposedly want take vaccine. Could claim damages “libel” take idiots court stupid unsubstantiated claims?  Found Inuit. Yeah they’ll start say “why trying scare us this” Yeah believe NE rifle season, verbally report harvested deer archery. game check anterless archery district.... Oh ok. guess we’re pretty much good now. get booster need hope everything dies hope another strain doesn’t come . Right ?  Boostering important immunocomprimised, like elderly cancer patients etc. young, healthy people boostering medium-term strategy reduce community spread. vaccines werent created delta, therefore thrid dose might relevant population. long term strategy would vaccinate unvaccinated, otherwise several hundred thousands die, additional economic losses aswell. countries like Spain, high vaccination rate biggest problems might gone next spring, others, much. Apart die hard Covid deniers / anti Covid measures folks far right assholes co-opted Covid thing part. listen reason all. want angry feel repressed blame anyone miserable life. 
 
Meanwhile, 85% people 12 fully vaccinated Netherlands, 87,5% 18 group. minneapolis originally quite good, CDC told vaxxed people stop masking, dropped fast (we least good vaccination rate then). see decent number people masking plenty places almost none. Whenever I've done pickup food places seem full unmasked people dining, think point even people vaccinated, delta, gonna contribute spread.   Couldnt least wait start next year give parents time get it? vaccine hasnt even approved 5-11 year olds week now. sure bud cuz conditions I'm one catch COVID-19 family. mom got it, grandma got it, grandpa got it, 2 baby brothers 5 &amp; 2 got cousin's got it. I'm fine. close contact recently living deer contracted it, i.e. gutting store, curious? I'll pop lunds need sometimes, point trust kn95 shots significant masking. way like em  ""Due hesitancy get vaccinated, countries withdrawn health benefits unvaccinated (by choice, medical reasons)""

Wouldn't wonderful thing bring here? MN, cases much spiking slow enduring climb months. think Southeast speed run basically delta blew much population quickly lax attitudes earlier school start dates.  logical fallacy argument. person judging two sciences qualified Please add BREAKING headline


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* want say done clinical trials. can’t say 75 lower 95 therefore worst b. Clinical trials different endpoints methods, way run comparison metanalisis. Metanalisis vaccine hard variety reasons. need studies like antibody levels cell response time like surrogate points efficacy infection. papers inactivated vaccines don’t hold well ARNm viral vector. Antibody levels drop faster lower high cell response way lower. worrisome 50yo. 
Im saying place used, nothing else like many countries use like stop gag measure. Even better ARNm vaccine supply lot countries giving ARNm booster three months second inactivated virus dose. Maybe place children, data needed trials comparing ARNm inactivated virus age group would welcome. think antivaxxer? I'm confused Covid transmit poorly humans outdoor conditions seem transmit well wild deer, presume spend time outdoors. differences physiology? seen Adam Curtis' documentary relevant here. deals Putin turned disinformation art form Russian politics kind grotesque theater, playing sides (like, people would set anti-Putin rallies etc.). aim confuse people much know believe more, believe nothing. guy middle power money extremely helpful hard opposition crystallize around one subject. 
 
Anyway, talking old friend oter day. know couple guys went deep end various conspiracies. Luckily came side, credit confront they'd misled couple years hard do. said, people proud - immersed echo chamber far easier go along shouting. critical thinking skills so, important, ability admit wrong. I'm lucky used research scientist Im used wrong 90% time :-)
 
And yes, utterly tragic COVID swept disinformation. Although first rodeo - Ive lived Fauci demonised AIDS deniers back early mid 90s.  Agreed. comment. wrote thought, “do really want make crazy girlfriend joke? world need that?” 

But thought, “fuck it”.  Rapid tests really fill gaps plans. CVS still website $12 piece (sold packs 2). No, doesn't. per capita.

[Per county per capita county per capita circles rural areas. They're substantially smaller, fact they're often bigger.  almost like cops care public safety.

How this? stop murdering people get vaccinated also vaccinated chances someone die, would (witch terrible minor well)

If vaccinated 12 older, convince them, probably aware side effects vaccines already measured pros cons came conclusion would worth it.  Thank excellent explanation. Fibrosis, bacterial infection, hypoxia, fungal infection, organ failure... yikes! I'm still baffled anyone would want leave chance get vaccinated made decision refused get vaccinated. Also don't? least anymore? Literally unpaid medical bills touched credit. set payment plan miss payments, never set payment first place get relentless emails letters... I'm actively going now, know works. Except ones unvaxxed. longer live Texas.  answer wolves. honestly won’t surprised insurance providers start requiring vaccine fork Covid care.

that something allowed many countries do! Advocating for.... What, exactly? I'm advocating single thing comment, simply informing responsible someone else's completely preventable medical bill. Get vaccinated, get deadly sick, simple.

If anything grand theft medical system done debt already carry. sucks, awful, I'd wish one. could prevent 1 2 little FREE jabs, fuck you? point refused vaccine KNOW burden carry something happen. Ew, *not* cleaning one’s house?

Is real? comply… 😳😱 liked story."
