I following Doctor Mama Jones years now. think presented data really well. little welfare actually provides compared pretty much full time job. People get fired asking like insensitive jerk time.    ""suspect"" it. state fact.

I suspect too. Again, claiming fact. Weekly testing BS. could infectious days next test. see many mosquitos heart disease kill day.  sure pretty weathly antivax fools think Biden actually cares, he's figurehead, opposed Trump was. He's obedient one corporate interests want weaponize supporters Twatter. 
But yeah definitely rite thing do.  San Francisco unaffordable sadly. pandemic really exposed lot idiots Yep agree feel concerning upcoming date year. Oops arrogance showing :) I’m happy you’re caring patients deserve much better whatever stupid question.
[Coronavirus infect cats — dogs,     Obviously people going freak this. see happening. works helps deal covid, talking points people asking sooner, purposefully delayed help Democrats politically. probably spin it. wanted along try blame Biden taking action sooner. one options spin negatively. try pin American deaths illness him. Still black, Michael. moves lie. That’s comparable though.

Unlike covid, there’s magical vaccine avoid obesity. Someone who’s obese can’t go pharmacy right pick vaccine cure obesity end hospital. takes months effort, absolute minimum, get healthy weight. severely obese, usually takes years. obese person might everything right try fix weight end hospital- it’s single/two part shot decrease chance severe illness.

Obesity major problem need address, decades upon decades teaching young Americans eat healthily take care themselves.

There’s also larger fact- obesity isn’t contagious. Someone who’s eaten themself needing bypass doesn’t affect health. don’t worry they’re going breathe near immunocompromised grandma kill her. They’re spreading obesity via aerosols everyone around them, pushing hospitals capacity. They’re affecting themselves.

It’s literally nothing alike. think need push better programs get Americans healthy, including subsidizing healthy food need be. Gym memberships even. still problem someone obese getting health care.

I problem anti-vaxxers spreading virus rampantly, taking hospital beds people need it. Why? get shot. free one. That’s it. wouldn’t hospital all. answer? irony mind blowing. 
Glad see point well. Yeah, good thing humble educated every thing sun. totally figured out, everyone else Earth too. everyone's victim, victimizing? I'll stand longer then, since going solve everyone's problems time wisdom compassion yours.  please ban unvaccinated travelers America too? might actually get plane. People worst qualify. Stop insinuating people you’ve never met, you’ve never deep conversation with, never seen truly vulnerable state malicious fact victims vicious system.  Unemployment payments form welfare indeed socialism. meet criteria socialism/welfare, must meet following:

* source mandatory public funding (e.g., taxes)
* source public distribution based proof hardship need
* Funding distribution methodology defined law
* government implements said methodology

Note clear difference unemployment insurance personal savings. problem cheese tits.  kind ""healthcare provider"" going doctors' recommendations provided proof claims vaccines help? Health professionals day vaccinated people GET TRANSMIT covid MUCH LOWER RATE unvaccinated people. top that, hospitalization rates lower saves lives around. somebody ended business exec board management private hospital? 

Another commenter provided [clear I'll link comment I’m curious deciding thing made age 12. 9 old loads taller heavier developed general 12 almost 13y old cousins. Curious it’s hormone thing. understanding people get B type C type rare. I'm expert haha know one given rare type meningitis usually required vaccine killed someone campus best interest it. You’ll never get majority people board federal control private business. 

I say never. Maybe 20-30 years. words France: Freedom Fries. Thanks sweetheart must endemicity promised! Great, we've gotten point call basement dweller. know first thing me, kind work do, often go outside, ""happy"" am, talk to. Maybe get high horse stop insulting reason.  time. “Right safe leaning environment…” mean, surprise? Especially considering majority anti vaxxers wear masks, they're regularly celebrating 'freedums' fools.

This rocket science. tested medical procedure.

So go son college student SF right say there’s city U.S. I’d rather going school. somebody else said, SF don’t play around. require vaccinations go certain buildings city, parents, we’re even allowed visit son campus dorm. whole school fully vaccinated students only, visitors. It’s amazing see seriously take COVID compared parts country. arrogance blinds ignorance. Truly terrible combination. It’s affliction die hard fringe extremist antivaxers suffer from, ironically enough. know you’ve never done med school training would humbled you. You’re still thinking problems exist individualistic systemic ignorant uninformed perspective. I’ll bet think systemic racism exists (it absolutely does, fuck racism isn’t clear don’t also accuse racist) you’re blind fact systemic miseducation lack education exists people vilify fact victims way. know every new variant get it’s 15 minutes fame. right now, nobody beating Delta. listen Osterholm Update TWiV epidemiologists virologists aren’t particularly concerned these, I’m either. Taliban also courts. Donald planned all... COVID hitting black people, massive funding vaccine research, testing, distribution did. doubt would slowed economy lockdowns. Sick burn bro.  never asked that.

Did lock due expectation 3% fatality rate?

I'm fight you.  Seems like want open smallpox anthrax vaults, they’re consistent. So, billions dead. live Texas feel like surrounded morons

But still love Texas

Just vote dumbass governor Absolutely false. Natural immunity significantly superior vaccine immunity. solution masks vaccinated people know heads ass want act hoiler thou refuse wear them. need stop acting like vaccines alone solution. Vaccines arent available huge part population everyone wear mask. want us rampant smallpox anthrax measles polio? 

Or prejudiced favor novel diseases?

Or psychopath? Last week less 10 cases day.

Low population makes cases /population seem bad? CDC slow update website?  3 7 year old. wonder would get side effects shot got? Kinda worried that. I'll absolutely get jabbed curious that. company retroactively gave cash awards. exactly question. read vaccinations zoo animals maybe that’s possible canines? whole sub absolutely gross. vaccine based least couple decades research, like someone brewed vaccine basement whim. 

I say anti-vax. many smart phones injected deltoid?

is anti-vax nonsense. a) people understand everything put bodies, b) things injected bodies harm us. anti-vaxx, maybe try argue silly points. fault don’t understand central dogma biology is

Is not? could choose learn things, like others have, refuse even consider idea might something yet understand, could learn something people actually know subject. said, making excuses them. could use internet educate themselves, use spread stupid hateful nonsense instead. could use libraries online courses, don't.

It definitely fault pretend know vaccines scientists doctors dedicated lives science medicine. fault people longer get hospital bed half society suddenly convinced doctors part giant conspiracy get them. literally fault families dying, they're taking rest us them. 

I know can't force anyone right thing. mean pretend what's happening good normal. owe people compassion. acting like I'm bad guy helpful. It’s cute thinks it’s easy go welfare. Currently monoclonal antibodies best treatment, need administered early symptom onset stage. administration en Masse outpatient setting people unlikely quarantine virus cleared could recipe rendering treatment useless resistance.

Fluvaxamine certain corticosteroids shown efficacy controlled trials. Ivermectin shown efficacy retrospectives, insignificant meta-analysis large study shown fraudulent.

There currently additional controlled trials ivermectin going around world including University Minnesota Oxford University. don’t lot optimism drug requires 50x levels achieved plasma neutralize 50% virus vivo experiments. also think people writing extremely safe drug “horse dewormer” going cause massive problems ridiculous. 25-fold increase weekly prescriptions means many doctors believe least can’t hurt.  bizarre thing pro-vaccine folks - reason, can’t wrap minds around fact people likely understand fact it’s free. don’t want reasons, shaming them/making poorer going help anything. know honestly wish people would stop ridiculing guys. tiger deterring rock sales gangbusters every time one wakes cuts bottom line. first drug multiple uses.  Like Europe then. Lol conspiracy theorists managed back situation everything conspires them. Bwahahahaha!  stupid question I'm probably going regret asking big risk dogs catching COVID? remember early hearing dogs catching think couple died? nothing else I'm curious.  It’s like $9 online script. Maybe another evolutionary split. Natural selection taking care hillbilly Neanderthal speak.  Yeah, every headache, minor cold, bad allergies kids means kid 4-5 days school. wife still one. wants vax really doesnt want carrying baby. Thankfully job kept lower risk situations, changing workstation times goes work, vaxed asap help keep risk low. doesnt want yet shes given birth, afterwards. dont want push I'm wishy washy doctor causing stress good baby either:( Lol, okay. I’ll get help, please work reading comprehension skills maybe next interaction bit better. I'm pretty sure people sick days, vacation days, days off.

My boss sent email today subject ""Remembering 9/11"". deleted without reading. 
 
I really want ""Remember 9/11"" anymore. day traumatic me, failed wars embarrassment, people eager ""Never forget"" give crap way, way Covid deaths.
 
I would OK never ""remembering 9/11"" again. studied. probably attention many potential solution populist push it.  vast majority people normal folks. fringe extremists might psych pathology large they’re scared human beings. Get outside talk people community more, you’ll find lot common ground even people happily vilify. Highest case rate Europe puzzled even health officials, likely underlying societal factors multi-generational living, larger families lower level previous infection. I’m going indoor 4 day convention NYC. Vaccine mandatory eligible bring negative test. Mandatory mask everyone.

Should upgrading masks event? Right go [Cotopaxi Teca Cotton face go KN95? matter? Comorbidity vaccine. Anyone without vaccine gets Covid hospitalized. Covid narrative now.  daughter lasted 3 days kindergarten getting email Sunday someone tested positive day class. masked, guarantee always 3 feet apart went 10 day quarantine. 

No kids positive back school now. Almost like masks might work. Jobs started mandating least month ago… scared concerned unvaccinated vaccinated? 
 
If risk infection/reinfection double jabbed 1 10000 per day high vaxxed areas. 
 
Or, approach 1% chance reinfection 3 months high vaxxed areas. 
 
When alternative everyone vaxxed makes 1 5000 risk infection twice likely non vaxxed. 
 
But really goes (3.84% vs 7.23%)."" Chance infection contact covid. 
 
So 1 5000, approach 2% 3 months. 
 
So care much double chance in/reinfection small number? care double size number, number big first place? likely get bigger new variants virus. 
 
As talking contraction efficacy vaccine relation severity infection. I'd find another OB, tbh, least book next appointment different OB practice, possible, get opinion. There's tons stuff happens pregnant women rarely protect from. Calling pregnant woman low risk crazy, even true good reason skip vaccine protect fetus. scared concerned unvaccinated vaccinated?  risk infection/reinfection double jabbed 1 10000 per day high vaxxed areas.  approach 1% chance reinfection 3 months high vaxxed areas.  alternative everyone vaxxed makes 1 5000 risk infection twice likely non vaxxed.  really goes (3.84% vs 7.23%).""

That's gets mad - ""it's flu"" people. flu years back pregnant youngest child. 5 year old brought home school husband 3 year old child caught it. flu delivering son worst experience life. husband bad lungs sick collapsed floor transferred bigger hospital ambulance. husband ended pneumonia next 2 years caught colds easily would cough blood. Laying next even healthy like sleeping next bowl rice krispies. terrible. 

We never got flu shot get every year now, without fail. learn hard way never want go again. would never forgive caused someone else become sick want something simple getting vaccinated.  

...and ""just flu"". weather sucks year. live Texas well hate Abbott, man menece public healthy safety. months ago, five COVID-19 patients, Saint Alphonsus Regional Medical Center Boise, Idaho. Thursday, patients vaccinated, reflection ""the amount misinformation that's absorbed, taken truth community people convinced want vaccinated, end here,"" Dr. Meghan McInerney, intensive care unit's medical director, told ABC even ""vaccinated"" still get covid Thank you! OK awesome!! Make sure take one hopefully body endure it. nature body usually take much challenge I'm sure fine invincible. miss including future covid boosters new vaccines come enforced without efficacy long term trials even though imminent threat allowed precedent covid. Way go. Open floodgates medical control tyranny worry bills either government pay tax hell medical bills bankrupt make sure compliant. slippery slope stay focused tell you. people said smoking safe thalomide wonderful. ❤ best luck future. Trust science. Thanks!  Says American pretending Irish. Brit, get Yanks live like this. Wow amazing whst happen y'all queda us factor. Cheers ancestoral homeland Yea, thought talking Ireland too. Brit, understand Yanks manage live like this.  OK, sub compilers point either explain find things look weird, everything usually expected. (Also first time I've seen OK listed ""deep south"" I'll take numbers going lmao) lot that. trust can't wrap heads around progression medicine technology. people used vaccines take 10+ years ability pump matter months. get initial safety trials plus emergency authorization includes many people within week amount data would get non-pandemic vaccine length entire regular trial. 

As species two problems, science literacy way low science communication sucks. need way better job educating people sciences also create fund scientists explain high level science common person. average person even 10% smarter sciences, would easily pick apart bullshit media stories morons keep sharing social media. 

It saddens watching Dad's generation fully believing conspiracy theories. base level knowledge would give critical thinking ability properly sort bullshit. sure matters. difficult larger country vaccinate smaller country assume right! 
And make important point two week period second dose. Honestly might early say, feel that's covid going look like ultimately highly vaxxed society. flareups (so far) nothing huge. It’s “children vs economy”. Vaccines masking eligible protects children economy.

It’s sacrificing children economy part craven sociopathic political strategy. See think lots people remember people fence….those may “other” them. Like happens countries people don’t believe it’s bad etc. Maybe took fridge mad hahahahaha. Can’t see others succeed fail miserably. Isn’t interesting how, flip side anti vax crowd don’t trust doctors, us afraid covid don’t trust doctors? bought masks late February 2020 got boosters late July year. don’t trust CDC protect me. turns I’ve correct. included countries reasonably confident data. check world data look data yourself. I've heard bands using [bell brass instruments. (You still take mask play though.) Jesus, okay.  /s sure showed me! Proportion matters Vaccines free, testing necessarily free.  mean, shortage tests huge increase tests used. supply shortages Really wish testing somehow started week schools opened. ""we ending restrictions 29 September""- Sucks live country. Europe never required masks kids. single kid age 12 died COVID Denmark far. This. belief people, part, low-education, successful don’t much reason feel good themselves. cling idea “smarter than” contra mainstream society makes feel believe better others. It’s thing Trump preyed get elected groups like KKK exist. Poor, uneducated white people need reason feel “better than” have. people realize obesity co-morbitiy, basically puts half US population list...some people dense... one interesting facet pandemic. likely years require extensive research census data even come margin error +/- tens hundreds thousands understand many excess mortalities experiencing. never going exact number estimates usually go dust settles. 4.5 million worldwide deaths likely undercount. We’re mandate probably never implemented. Yes, said *consists* poor countries. Yes charged test. untreated mental issues. else could explain break reality? problem underfunding. problem small percentage federal dollars actually gets classroom. [Much sucked administrative bloat]. 7th lowest spending per pupil nation. spend insane amount budget administrative costs. School districts loaded assistant superintendents deputy superintendents followed assistant deputy superintendents. Every single county superintendent. I'm treating like flu I'm vaccinated, since that's likely bad would get contracted now. no, I'm afraid unvaxed people vaccinated people. know handful people genuinely cannot get it, annoyed scared since country reached herd numbers yet. 

I wearing mask inside places business right cases high area risk infection, even severe, lot higher be. think I'd flu got bad too, though. comment automatically removed linked source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

Nobody claimed people said that, requiring vaccine passport gain entry pubs essentially thing. said many words, mean big reason many get vaccinated. friend group (25-35 year olds) ones hesitant vaccines got two main reasons - either go holiday go pub. didn’t lol \o/. Really nice still freedom lower deaths per capita guys. opposed happy get it. currently following doctors recommendations. like I’m getting voted like I’m ignorant Good news them. indeed never vaccinated. needing ride within 3 hours Loveland CO, let know. I’m already vaccinated video still wrecked serious PTSD scar years ""I hear get work. hear I'm driving. hear I'm showering. hear I'm laying go sleep,"" Rice said telemetry alarm. Last month, replaced coffee maker reminded alarm's sound. Lol no, unions practically nonexistent apart specific jobs Mississippi. Even parents, college professors, don’t union. I've heard immune system maturity less weight. that's heard Reddit... First people pay unemployment, r fired, yes able get paid find different job. people hateful others, asking extra money anyone. see people commenting rude, calling names. 

If u cannot get vaccine based religion, cannot get one medical reasons, ur fired, 100% wrong. receive unemployment. 

But put blanket statements saying r hypocrites, leeches collecting unemployment, u r wrong. u pay u receive. people upset paid unemployment passed put in, top collecting pandemic relief money. refusing work able collect year make would working.

I’m actually pleased see many forced pay back, lied job interviews applications, yes u held accountable. Many never went weekly interviews even called ask businesses hiring. Yes u may make u did, work industry u used too, job job, making money vs collecting ur supposed doing, looking work still. 

Heck saw asking ebt accepted countries taking vacation island. 🤦‍♀️ upsets people. Ur collecting unemployment survive save possible pay bills, like said abused it.

The problem everyone abused situation, many collected legitimate reasons. refusing return work reasons like fear, getting twice much made, caused many get upset rightfully so. 

We’ve understaffed year, since unemployment ended, people randomly coming asking hiring, almost daily. sad reality many businesses.

But wow, everyone hateful, calling people hypocrites, looking sides situation refusing believe r perspectives own, kinda sad. 

I swear people never cease amaze me, many assume know people saying. judge group based actions few. 🤦‍♀️ exhausting, every Republican same, every Democrat same, politics yet somehow, turns it. disheartening see many people immediately say anti-vaxxers causing that, want handouts. anti-vaxxers political sides, know lot dems many reasons.

I friends medical field medically cannot get vax, could lose jobs. anti-vaxxers, able collect unemployment. even worked thru pandemic covid wards, well vaccine. 

Anyone making immediate assumptions saying people shouldn’t collect aren’t vaxxed, speaks volumes. 

You judging others, sad. I’m judging saying have, simply showing u u perceived others, maybe ask kinder one another put blanket statements one group.  I’m guessing almost large companies going go vaccination only.

Most rest probably use rapid tests/saliva testing model used lot college campuses last year. mega campuses 40,000+ students make work, companies issue. zero evidence helps. need push false narrative. Yeah, I'm kinda surprised requiring masks schools under-12s. reason I'm done hearing 9/11 every year.

It's tiresome. Oh right, makes sense lol CDC always said unvaccinated people need wear masks indoors. Vaccinated people mask safe. Imagine petty. bonkers. fully welcome new information *because* want wrong. Far many people welcome new information they'll admit wrong. Ego arrogance get way.  Israel that? Irishman, feel way Brits moment. Boris Johnson, PM, REALLY? South, also South Dakota.  Traffic jams constant non-covid times public transport varies depending live. Health insurance expensive Europe well, single payer like countries partly paid employer. generally expensive country Europe things, like car insurance. Also weather similair Seattle, lots rain wind.

From cultural point view people friendly, work making friends, like joining club something. humour sarcastic, lots joking around, Americans find hard adapt to. people getting care now. beds taken unvaccinated. pandemic vaccine. It’s like car crashes 1000s people involved every frickin day.  people talking this.

Microsoft already allows permanent remote. announcement affects people want office. sucks. I've gotten accused wanting live fear, need it. 

Say what? one afraid take vaccine 96% doctors taken. one afraid wear mask want ""breathe garbage,"" whatever fuck means. 

You're one scared illuminati whoever trying control us... what? Making us stay houses produce consume? somehow benefits them? 

You're one afraid pharmaceutical corruption anti-covid drugs take comes smuggled Mexico (hydroxychloroquine) sold animal feed store? 

And I'm one living irrational fear? Thanks 🤗 I'm glad video positive effect. dramatic sticks you.

I really think people need see stuff--more actual footage/audio covid wards. easy keep telling ""it's flu."" compare current numbers US. hospitalizations would equal 20,000 hospitalizations US. 3900 people ICU. 90,000 cases per day. Though recently still around 132,000 cases per day. That's Ireland would population US, compare numbers easily. beginning people fine sacrificing elderly too. Something magic called *v c c n e* I'm unsure real life we're witnessing branching realities. shit wild. sad way. lot people go hospital need life saving elective surgery losing bed selfish person needed get vaccinated feels quite like misfortune. kinda hard explain world trying do.

But look many people test.. 6 million people used 13M tests.

Currently: good weather, scandinavian culture helps lot (young people living etc..).

We around 100 Cases/1M pop, maybe 1-3 death daily whole population.

We try open up. far havn't masks ages, kids back school month. Lets see goes. true. Though, everyone tipping point, U.S. exist first place. big Murdoch media presence.  never anything good like 401k surprise places like Brazil point natural herd immunity already. True, useless COVID. doses high enough work would essentially kill you. People taking horse paste COVID reasons brightest.

But doctors really prescribe something know work? really think so. like giving antibiotics people ill virus, except drug particular really joke actually kill you. cases blindness.... That's mean dangerous. human doses, dangerous still really good on. horse doses.... know.


The things suggested work vaccination antibody therapy. know enough talk them, there's plenty studies people know support it. given tiny Lenovo computer work almost fit pocket, specs aren’t great, like mentioned runs great. know coworkers never issues either you’re one first people I’ve seen that’s problem 11 year old got month could get vax. past now, barring long term issues. Logistically, would like school remove them? Send campus police dorm rooms escort campus? arrested trespassing? Deactivate IDs lock out? solution might best option based end goal - get everyone vaccinated. Died lived. Kinks say it? Yes tests go $200 There's ""off road"" except national parks allowed there. place checkerboard countryside farms roading businesses tracks.

Well, given seeing many fucking idiots wear mask noses here... Genuine question: *not* get it? earth getting vaccine “only chance protecting season”? never going end. Time move treat like normal endemic virus. That's joke ಠ_ಠ Full vaccinated 53.6%. well! flu joke! I've getting flu vaccine since 9 years old. I'm 33 now.

Been way long alive,and nobody ever complained.  hear nurses scrambling panic alarms go off. simply walk best save you. Remember, there's much really vaccinated. COVID brought highly visible symptoms like skin blistering face like chickenpox, everyone would rush get vaccine asap. one paradoxes pandemic: it’s mostly invisible. don’t see people sick it, either isolating inside homes hospitals. Worth noting although ton infections since schools went back, hospitalisations 2x lower January peak, deaths 7x.  US passed 75% adults 1 dose (I believe full vaccination ~64%). San Francisco high rates vaccination. somewhere around 90% kids 12-19 vaccinated. Schools cautiously open masks indoors covid shit show seeing places. Probably high rates vaccination plus people wearing masks public allowing that. We're getting refrigerator trucks Florida, funeral homes crematoriums overwhelmed. Hospitals built overflow tents. county one several issued official notice call 911 unless life death emergency. 

Yet judge ordered schools can't require kids wear masks (for now, ongoing legal battle). dangerous Pandora’s box ripe abuse.

Originally said denied COVERAGE. Coverage anything. kind insurance. That's awful. 

Triage exists reason, overtaxed resources places, yeah. never business denying anyone insurance coverage. mean, embarrassment too. (ROI) children approved vaccination, agree Unvaccinated children extremely low risk. Even vaccination, vulnerable still risk.

Thankfully seems (from articles I've read) lot districts mask mandates FL said they're going ignore appeals court ruling time (said ruling Desantis' policy mask mandates stands).

Of nurses I've spoken hospital getting vaccinated state political (their body, choice), concerned potential health problems associated (which crazy considering risks getting covid), vaccine work anyway, concerned affecting fertility. 

Some concerns voiced vaccine released us December. like said preciously, overwhelming majority nurses vaccinated. know natural infection generates significantly robust memory

No, necessarily immunocompromised people. That’s vaccines/boosters exist. 

And re-infection won’t “strengthen” shit I’m unvaxxed vent.  wish videos crazy hospitals are, 1.5 years ago, spilling hallways parking lots. enough beds. get even basic things like food time. poor hospital workers way past limit. survive job, would've quit.

They're humans spreading families lives thin save others especially including ones refuse vaccine. selfishness refusing vaccine pushed people critical conditions overpop.

Edit: sometimes people think elderly and/or obese risk. prevent transmission not?

Vaccines prevent around 90% transmissions, seatbelts prevent around X% accident fatalities. mixed messaging around seatbelts speed limits also infuriate indoor settings safer fully vaccinated

Outdoor settings still safer even fully vaccinated.  Americans tend believe defiance sign maturity independence.  since GDP grew last year despite pubs closed good chunk year.

I actually theory reason San Francisco hit way New York first COVID cases came people travelled China - Chinese community knew minimize spread, it. Meanwhile, New York COVID cases people travelled Europe, seen pandemic 100 years.

Going school requires vaccines. one thought authoritarian. low effort posting. No, also passed law saying social media companies can't ban people viewpoints.   got Lambdas Mus town. like Revenge Nerds here. 4 police murdered someone front crowd US fine that. regular school shootings regulations speak of.

That’s I’m thinking.

There recent [/r/science showed efficacy rate amongst 32k vaccinated people J&amp;J vaccine shocking low 60%, closely matches preliminary efficacy rates reported earlier clinical trials (66%)

Furthermore, there's barely news coverage press regarding existence booster shots. see stuff saying ""soon"" meanwhile Pfizer Moderna booster shots rolling around people getting secured setup.

I got symptoms possibly cold, symptoms overlap COVID, I'm worried going bad, even though vaccinated late March J&amp;J. Restrictions authoritarian. US never enforced restrictions kind point pandemic. contact tracing, mask enforcement, real enforced quarantines. like authroitarian place like Sweden?  discussion need. Thank advance!

So, let’s say per model, 100% US vaccinated, masked, sheltered place month. would control spread **in US**? 7.6 billion people, 328 million here. 

An unfortunate reality Americans helping spread covid due lack complicity freedom travel. We’re highest number covid cases deaths world, we’re going tour!
If take baby step clean act, make difference abroad home.

What breeding grounds aren’t covered enough? new vaccine mandate hopeful many addressed. Schools, hospitals, federal buildings, workplace 100 workers: hotspots stand me.

Getting rid covid entirely seem hopeless point, controlling spread limiting ability mutate seems like best shot have. Imagine get numbers similar level flu! Even pre covid flu mortality rates (~22k-34k last two seasons) preferable recent covid mortality rates (~375k 2020).

Vaccine vaccine transmission happen, lethality less. Complications less. 
It’s easy instead point people complying accuse them. selfish; they’re choosing neighbors.

What doctor? one emergency room saw four years ago allergic reaction?  ER doctor saw ten years ago animal bite? doctor? Preventative care doesn’t happen lot people here, even insurance many don’t regular primary care doctor coverage changes happen quickly. 

I mean, we’d still antivaxx nut jobs. England France show that. think would less medical distrust whole everyone access regular preventative care here, opportunity actually build relationship trust physician. *any* physician. ""Karra Harwood murdered 4 year old daughter"" 
  
That's real headline here. lol, seem confused, i'm libertarian, i'm pro-mask vaccine mandate.

no one going get unemployment flat refusing comply company policy. basically enough people got sick enough either placebo ivermectin group draw conclusions original planned study whether prevented worse outcomes (although actually fewer worse outcomes ivermectin group). changed focus study effect symptom duration, 10 days ivermectin group 12 placebo, said statistically insignificant. 

It sound like best run trial (they mention label mix ups gave everyone ivermectin one point 17 days discounted people kept data sensitivity analysis—don't know means).

There's loads scary footage around world...

Sincerely,

John Pfizer saying mom got kidney hospital covid now?    take every Friday get tested? Sounds great, I've got lots sick time... Strange, thought following coffee grounds. Good know. thought due FDA asking Pfizer Moderna enroll children trials rule rare side effects. Initially people worried would mean results would delayed beyond fall 2021, enrollment apparently happened faster July: ""The changes ongoing pediatric trials run Moderna Pfizer German partner, BioNTech, could delay availability vaccines children 5 11 beyond hoped-for timeline early fall, although unclear much. country faces surge fueled largely cases unvaccinated people school year approaches, pediatricians families impatiently awaited shots protection.""  Nope different level trust medical community

I grant one anti-vaxxer actually stays home suffer/die own, get Covid. go hospital things get bad enough, even use kind medication ever, get use excuse. clearly trust ""medical community"" enough things get dire. care enough (about anyone themselves) help keep things getting dire first place.   I’m pumped tell people “well don’t work, stay home &amp; scared vaccine us vaccinated people enjoy life. Nobody making get it”  Ban unvaccinated air travel. work. **Findings:** randomized clinical trial included 476 patients, duration symptoms significantly different patients received 5-day course ivermectin compared placebo (median time resolution symptoms, 10 vs 12 days; hazard ratio resolution symptoms, 1.07).

**Meaning:** findings support use ivermectin treatment mild COVID-19, although larger trials may needed understand effects clinically relevant outcomes. unemployment is. study also showed surgical masks work old people, young. would raise sane person wonder be. spoiler: cant... study bullshit

reference: 63, table A15

intervention significant impact 50 year old people, trash, study, anything, shows mask effects cannot shown methodology. Exempt really. example access NYC one work healthcare NYC. think even register licensed ny. *not* one new York state.  reason compromise someone can't take five minutes take shot.

*Shrugs* Insurance expensive enough without adding fluff it. think banned public areas (like what's happening now) perfectly acceptable consequence getting Vaxed. got me, guess really care. tf wants go anyway mean brian worms affecting you. Look Alabama last time checked negative ICU beds available. attributed non-vaxed population. 100% covid infected taking ICU beds non-vaxed people US. Vaxed people although spread one's dying it. sad brainwashed anti vaxxers are. Look dude keep tinfoil hat head I'm sure Alex Jones podcast need listen to. FDA tells people take ivermectin covid, absolutely pushing it.

But specific thing impotence supported. work. People vaccine still getting sick. point? One vaccinated person still give virus another vaccinated person. What's point ? Tell me. addition fine automatically nominated HCA award. Uh oh. come leopards faces would say happened know insurance premiums would go weight nothing else would ever happen.

No reason give anything people take. Same, also fortunate work home. many random viruses going around year top worry Covid-19. Going long fall/winter. pretty simple.

9/11 brown people funny accents. Covid invisible.

If covid hitting black people, white america would problem forced vaccinations. staring face drugstores. mean, could tell parts materials fridge made might make eyes cross, still know need fridge life. Nobody possibly understand everything sun, mean can't take advantage cool shit people invented us benefit from. know, like satellites logistics vaccines. zero chance people understand smart phones work, yet use them. somehow buck stops comes vaccines?

They’ll straight bully college kids call irresponsible behaviour *among peers* call us nerds virgins, despite ostensibly grown adults well past school days. it’s messed anything reinforces anti-maskers thinking right.

Well, reading study, reading present non-results understanding horrible methodology failed miserably...

can blame them? study destroyed evidence based reviews (if even gets far). study retracted put away damages scientific method. That's daughter too. ""Mommy I'm next group right? When's turn?"" took elementary kids days ago annual flu shots. Fair enough. Sometimes four different walls priceless.  still heart ❤️ Living user name. see Roberts Barrett affirming precedent. always fun watching people realize ""choice"" means picking one two things, getting them.  Three doses like 90%+ effective preventing infection. think data much prevents transmission breakthrough cases, know even 2 doses greatly reducing total cumulative viral load shortening infection time significant. lot prevent mutation fewer infections, fewer viruses rare breakthrough cases, likely lower transmissibility thanks lower viral loads (even little bit). 

Masking still important addition vaccination. three doses effective fitted n95 2 doses still better surgical mask. vs thing. both. social distance possible regular testing, tracing, isolating. Layers great. Got third (J&amp;J plus two shots Pfizer), waiting booster this, exactly reason.

There’s also evidence people received doses vaccine different types (ie. AstraZeneca Moderna) better antibodies received two identical doses.

Idk make far pandemic take seriously  is, almost word-for-word, unvaccinated friend told couple weeks back. drives truck cross-country he's goddamned idiot covid. [Just look daily cases chart well wasnt responding OP's question - responding question decline cases linked data deep south.

we're also seeing slight decline overall US cases since beginning month - [US Covid uncle who, *every* time hears “someone got covid” ask “But sick? symptoms? It’s good people getting sick, way get immune, nobody actually danger anymore, it’s flu.”

The problem none authorities calling idiots. misinformation, fallen it. like them, conflating social media posts media personalities agreeing authorities authorities themselves, random Reddit poster MSNBC anchor spokesman CDC something.

I buy claim giving information anything. quote Mark Twain trite, probably true: can't reason someone something reasoned first place. government already spends hundreds millions dollars COVID outreach, fact checking, etc. CDC generated reports showing tactics appear working vaccination rates stagnated, especially ""Republican areas"" (for lack better phrase). We've tried exact approach suggesting year really helped anything. Even March way early. takes 3-4 weeks get two shots another 2 weeks considered fully vaccinated. another week two infection incubate develop required hospitalization.

Its confirmation bias. pick argument leads solution want. think Canada's outlook better couple reasons. understanding generally vaccines, longer gap doses leads better immunity. Widening time doses recommended US also, listened to. There's another benefit though - quickly vaccinated willing population means waning generally happen within similar timeframe. spread vaccination period, waning vaccines impact smaller portion population time. 
 
This conjecture think could take period linear growth first doses rolling window waning immunity.

Even don’t take certificate… every single teacher job app asks you’ve broken contract before, may well “throw application garbage” button. They’re going want talk former supervisor, principal going tear new hole get contacted. 

You could come back “Who cares? teach?”, would sigh, shake head, pretend I’ve never questioned sanity genuinely loving profession.

Anyway, us human beings families bills basic needs. Teachers underpaid typically sitting huge savings accounts. us can’t afford walk away. Hence hoax horse paste. live area didn’t mask mandate schools, covid exploded, mask mandate effect, cases dropped dramatically. I’d say work quite well. 

I however don’t want rush, whatever need make safe possible I’d prefer. unite country 9/11. Everyone got really angry wanted revenge.

Good luck, son. didn’t see post can’t comment specifically comment said tweet. it’s fairly misleading several reasons.

1) Reduced risk infection reduced risk hospitalization/death aren’t really separate, independent events. fact vaccines good significantly reduced people’s likelihood even infected pretty critical vaccine’s success. tweet doesn’t include context reduction infection makes seem like anyone get infected. look numbers CDC study, high delta period fully vaccinated people getting infected almost 80% LESS often non fully vaxxed. That’s huge reduction! anything happens “after infection” take account infection much, much lower first place. saving lives right start.

2) whole 1.5x likely go hospital 2x likely die also downplay numbers don’t take account first point. period mentioned before, 30% fewer infected vaccinated people hospitalized non fully vaxxed. That’s big reduction, importantly comes top 80% FEWER people infected first place! numbers start compound, end number vaccinated people hospitalized dying close zero percent.

3) study lumped partially vaccinated people unvaccinated, likely led lower gap two groups partially vaccinated people likely cell response reduces chance hospitalized dying even risk infection reduced much. study’s authors mention complicating factor analysis. See, that's difference Hungary ..here people say ..""You live life consequences "", live unhealthy life expect others feel bad reasonably certain safety possible. ramifications letting something slip would catastrophic. Put health risks aside, never get single parent vaccinate child Covid maybe ever. I'm hugely pro-vax discovered unforeseen reaction halted vaccines kiddos, would bring back 6 months later ""fix it?""

You read links sometime. Bush v. Gore c'mon man Technically logistic curve, uses e^t anyway comment still valid. Sadly likely see top half well. really needed kids' trials finished couple weeks earlier.

Although perhaps Pfizer repeatedly saying they'll data end September quiet part saying ""after kids exposed school starts"" Israel well vaccinating older population, take look age ranges population, they've got 25% 14 under. Combined enough anti-vaxxers, they're still hovering around 66% vaccinated. majority, high enough hit herd immunity.

Masks probably around sometime everyone get vaccinated. kids much lower chance complications, lot parents want risk kids exceptions. matter 'when' seen. first pandemic gather data close real time ease first rapidly developed vaccines, period. We're writing playbook first time.

I hear wanting know exactly when. date would awesome. there's many variables, enough vaccinated, potential even infectious variants (heaven forbid) invalidate guesses could come right now. mean... sure. statistically less severe young people, many young people taking seriously. large part what's contributing case surge shortages ICU beds across many regions. Young people also dying (including colleague's friend refused get vaccine died 20's). 

If larger ICU capacity better treatments, big deal, that's are. course ridiculous. way grown adults behaving last 18 months ridiculous, I'd say extremely plausible scenario.

If someone told years ago people would saying things they're saying now, never believe it.  mother kids developed ME/CFS prolonged viral illness five years ago (two years divorced). went successful lawyer practically bedridden less two years permanent disability. heartbreaking watch decline, still keeps children least two days week rests in-between. depressing think ""long COVID"" finally helping ME/CFS get attention (and, importantly, research funding), I'm glad happening.

Delta however gathering steam. surge next months. Would voted yes separate elections recall replacement, case we'd actually get legit candidates running. 

When Newsom went back word reduce vaccination exemptions (in 2018 2019 -- covid), knew piece shit. impossible, highly unlikely. CDC guidelines assume three months post-illness immunity need isolate test period even re-exposed. course, even happened, would way prove it; intermittently test positive weeks illness.   getting downvoted?

And talk Ivermectin straight face.  Public Texas hospitals stuck state government *banning* vaccine mandates, federal government *requiring* vaccine mandates.

Let shit show begin.  Last 7 days average per capita cases Ireland 36th 207 countries World. People probably take safe, effective free vaccine heart disease instead politicizing it… oh wait, COVID, heart disease. anti-vaxxers dig heels. Murderous traitors.  need vaccinated get pub.

I hope she’s great now. require positive cases reported contact tracing whatsoever. close schools count zero cases *taps forehead* That’s fair. guess said positivity rate LEAST 4.25%. thing. would come make something like up? would interesting see granular data antivax workers.

A breakdown kind staffers talking would somewhat useful. 

How many nurses? type nurse? big difference LPN RN. 

Then medical technicians pharmacy.

How many support staff? Cleaning crew? workers? Food workers? We're talking 2021 last year. migrant crisis 2015 told every day people suffering drowning Mediterranean talk.

I guess people act similarly Covid news. gets real point (you see video, relative dies it). Yes, it’s stupid irrational. human weakness. already directly smokers indirectly health issues.

Many plans raised rates gave discounts smoker, getting physical, documented gym time, etc. still didn’t get vaccinated? doctor telling it’s Russian roulette? That’s crazy. meant say slightest. English first language maybe missed nuance language used guess? honestly understand post downvoted (doesn't bother though since karma important me).

In mind genuinely thanking poster sharing opinion. phrase ""Not going try argue anything wrote since would repeating myself"" simply meant already written arguments previous posts thread. new better argumentation bring forth wrote. meant rude (edit: actually trying keep good tone).

I mean moment read Obama hitlers son developed covid conjunction China weaken country invasion.......

I gave entire section planet. health system basically non existent, police completely useless public transport joke. Oh finally take somewhere rent take 70% salary. Hardly functional Problem get sick covid first without vaccine get antibody test afterwards confirm 1) actually got covid cold 2) body actually built antibodies it. Immune response varies greatly individuals. studies including Israeli study show immune people got infected vaccinated. unfortunate get real deal infection vaccine available fortunate enough get vaccinated after. 

People gamble wanting natural infection route. mention unvaccinated collapsing health care systems communities low vax rates. socialism purely description country's welfare policies. better yet, move out. Amazing ain't left 12 age vaccine gets approved.  Leopards eating faces  mean? wish would! I’m guessing maybe feel comfortable taking small steps rather going once. 

I mean can’t even get NYPD get vaccinated without threat withholding pay. (Which sad &amp; embarrassing IMHO). Apparently, whole force afraid needles. 🤷 incredible see NY school kids get shots less resistance setting good example. Covid #1 killer cops NY still won’t even mask get shot. 

My point think expect resistance lunatic fringe vocal minority extremist there. pandemic gutted faith humanity.  HPV vaccine recommended starting age 11 remember friends talking cool got (a series 3 doses, too) made feel better getting it. Heck, even know was, health protect me. can't imagine i'd feel adults around telling would make grow horns, whatever hell anti vaxxers spew days. Kudos today's kids. dad thinks trump right hydroxychloroquine, somehow conspiracy suppressed use kept accepted effective treatment COVID. sound like trump given drug hospital, either, dad thinks ""they"" let it, LOL.  Based someone share full text article, I’m getting paywall Finally got mobile!
Thanks mods SF even show vaccination card enter eat restaurant. Props taking seriously.  know easily forged? say, signatures people giving shots database, fake signature would detected pretty easily.  hope so. registered nurse working Cigna, according TikTok saw Thursday. IHas reviewed great Facebook moms gun toting Patriots!    submitted mine company agency contracted process them. got email next day saying verified assume use kind software. Maybe vaccinator’s signatures uploaded database? already use Teams. kids younger 5? baby 6 months old I'm tired worrying every step take outside house rowhtout 

Ah well, I'll wait out. Get vaxxed people Alpha, Beta, Gamma, B.1.617.2, Epsilon, Zeta, Eta, Theta...  Good riddance. Smart country intelligent policies. USA country respected intelligence especially found nearly 30% entire country comprised anti-vaxxing conspiracy theorist faux Constitutionalists.  learned free individual, provider bill insurance company Also COVID cases like 300 million Americans vaccinated opposed vaccine available? It’s ok ask questions… sayin hell seeing 3 deaths reported? sounds like problem tracker using Florida. report weekly. Well, read it. listened :( Ok thanks. bill insurance company. insurance, subsidized. personally pay nothing either way. like yearly physical. Boop. God, fucking 5 year old get need vaccines, fuck can’t adults it?!? 

Just mind boggling we’re still state science gave world LIFE SAVING vaccine incredible time.   take take effect. does, employers refuse comply, someone gets virus site, they're facing big liability lawsuit. miscarriage start pandemic, required surgery fall clear fertility issues, became pregnant January year. 

I think if, year now, I’m facing second pregnancy normal world, I’m gonna faintest clue haha. Thank sympathy. responding absolutist statement think many vaccinated people internalized incorrectly. less deaths per day vaccine. speculate whys people know gave wearing masks vaccinated. That's big change I'm aware of. Yes, much like Cold War. completely cold, definitely hot war. Hey, that's insulting Neanderthals!  Shitty humans mocked him. wouldn’t consider adults. Maybe due governor protecting baby mask mandates waaaaaa dickscriminatio people know freedom responsibility entails. They're patriots, they're cowards fools. Uh, completely cold. One side using kamikaze tactics biological weapons. also sporadic bombing attempts. let's forget failed insurrection earlier year follow-up next week.  can't wait. I'll first line get 12s vaccinated. Different tests totally different scales. reason others, FDA recommend using antibody test gauge immunity levels. understand NYC implement vaccine mandate 12+ school crowd. part momentum! Encourage urban areas adopt similar policies. bullshit. CDC published numbers still show cases. Anyone unvaccinated taking valuable hospital space. played stupid games, reason punish intelligent it. Regions Canada hesitant, through. Alberta Saskatchewan rather low vaccination rates. grins make blood boil disagreeing thread all. thing they’re two completely different things. Comparing misses mark somewhat. Yes Covid huge tragedy human cost gets lost it’s prolonged nebulous. think it’s important honor 9/11 victims Covid deaths opioids, gun violence, hate crimes, drunk driving, war - sadly list goes on.

I remember 9/11 came together country. first time life (I 24) experienced love camaraderie neighborly connection everyone came contact with. People honking horn‘s traffic, weren’t impatient, angry other, everywhere went people human together. Alas wasn’t case lot anti-Muslim rage actions still unacceptable makes sad day. 

Unfortunately, today Covid, there’s much division. that’s difference is. 650,000 dead people tragedy words can’t describe. Add divided nation people literally hating, fighting killing efforts safe lives. would like people fighting firefighters rushing buildings. hate severity situation gets lost drama political bullshit. hope unite nation like then. that’s honestly way humans respond tragedy  article: ""The schools chronically underfunded decades, I'm concerned soap bathroom,"" Newell told Insider. ....Last month, eighth-grader Mississippi middle school died COVID-19 days Republican Gov. Tate Reeves held press conference claiming virus causes ""sniffles"" children 18.” That's hasnt really issue forecasters confident weathered storm. backed article, even 1 45 it, 1 45 hospital it.

At point figures anyone care hospitalisations. Perfect. Today run walk get boosters EVERYTHING meningitis, pneumonia, flu, covid, tentanus, hell mean MMR would need boost natural body make lifetime immunty anymore science, whooping cough, HPV? wait next week may able coffee Starbucks job without all.   rarely get sick… in part wash hands, wear mask (during COVID), get COVID flu shots.

They're tools help us reduce risk illness. Omg that'd amazing! Fingers crossed! son turns 5 Feb. mean chill? Like don’t know calm make worse? agree still curfew 23h30 :(  This. Denmark Ireland heavily vaxxed. Hopefully numbers going forward proof world way go. Start charging people negligence.  pointing vaccine safe everyone - even people GBS.

I think people missing different type vaccine. People bad reactions flu vaccine vaccines guaranteed bad reaction COVID vaccine new technology. Prior vaccines produced eggs contained inactivated viruses. COVID vaccine egg based synthesized contain whole virus, one exposed coat proteins. Therefore egg allergy issues everyone feel safe getting vaccinated.

I wanted spread good news.    unvaccinated turned away deprioritized. give lung transplant chronic smoker, give last ICU bed anti-vaxxer. 

He died heat disease. Thank you! hope too. guess testament masks took 3 weeks one kids catch something. usually happens first week, ha.  think lot deaths coming misinformation intentional disinformation. want know whether foreign nation responsible initially kicking wave disinfo, so, one.  Former regulator/auditor:
Yes, generally. Work home makes office space extension office (workers comp applies situations injured job duties). gets complicated home away home exemptions like hotel travel work also applies, lines blurred. 
A company may exempt remote work, run risk OSHA WC rules hitting injured - therefore making remote workspace actual workspace. 

I’m vaccine honestly mandates they’re taking shape definitely see future civil lawsuits arise various aspects this. Right seems make sense - perhaps - don’t think we’ve vetted far enough along. boosters going mandatory all? next year? 2023? 2026? allowed go overdue? long? allowed mix vaccines? Etc. me, solution requiring people participating lie (ie cannot mix lie cvs person) undercuts entire ethical stance mandate. Taking steps fight rampant stupidity hard job worthy one.

The mean grins faces feeding problem truly ugly look. say believe it’s mental problems. People unhappy depressed, get caught cult mentality makes feel special important, get radicalized reject rational thinking.

If you’ve read cults, know difficult get people mentality, becomes part personality are, gives (twisted) sense lives. feel, maybe first time lives, part something important. It’s tragic. Oxygen important It’s almost coordinated campaign certain billionaires defund education propagate misinformation results society easily exploited certain billionaires. Since it’s politicized, it’s also sign many people disagree political viewpoint.

They’ve used cv. place gonna flip studies show ivermectin actually help taken early on.

I think one main problems patient bad enough go hospital, virus done much damage anti-virals really help.  That's lot kids testing positive one month. Sorry wasn’t implying anything safe fetus? lots drugs aren’t safe pregnant. I’m pro treating Covid ivermectin also think it’s ridiculous amount media coverage getting. It’s honestly huge waste energy arguing. 

But hell world gone crazy Yeah unlike Americans go medicentre free. Sure wait hour two, main barrier us time, money. Uh .. ok .. I'll look best information vaccines rolled out. people wonder younger generations cynical disillusioned. also took back March 2020 NYC. 
Ambulances FDR day, empty streets, early fear. seeing doctor $100

Did miss replying someone Canada? I've heard similar stories. Ivermectin super safe normal dosages, taken early signs 1st symptoms, look like help significantly. Thankfully, grandma finally pulled head one. step-gpa still trumps lapdog least grandma starting realize duped. There’s hope them, least ones became disillusioned lost election lead insurrection. Double single dose kids? amount hard science nursing degree kind scary low.. used teach lab courses - watered bullshit. makes sense, work highly interactive tactile role minor emphasis critical thinking serious de novo problem solving. feel much opposite, really bad December one vaccinated really felt them. point it’s job can’t get worked idiots, there’s lot work now, don’t time it. exceptions, wouldn’t job differently regardless emotion different. I’m resident physician spent fair share time icu. Nursing much science process. They're learning things, going near deep biomechanical processes like doctors pharmacists do. Seems top transfer list unvaccinated (by choice) covid patients unvaccinated ICU occupiers survive held legally responsible every death cause.  high levels education  hard time believing took antivax person one ICUs, wouldn’t change mind. Sure, folks would stubborn. seeing close real life would shock them.  right answer. went back mid august school taking kinds precautions (masks, air filtration, pods, distancing, etc) we’ve ended colds anyway. covid, thankfully, little kids still managing germ factories. Seems like viruses field day year isolation many us.

Good luck, hope tests negative symptoms usual back school cold.   77 cases per 1 million vaccinated males 12-17. vaccine makes less likely get less likely pass onto them. addition spreading less Covid around make overall situation better, thus lowering chances getting freeing hospital resources case *do* get it.

Unfortunately 100 % guarantees, every little bit helps. impression still dying disproportionate percentage, due factors mentioned (higher representation “essential” customer facing service), combined large degree vaccine hesitancy (from previous government programs Tuskegee), large number pre-existing conditions (due existing wealth inequality).  Yea, flimsy piece cloth haphazardly placed face, taking people understand better, foolproof protection surrounded 22 people several hours. 

Mask efficacy (N-95 aside) helpful proven lab studies, labs aren’t real life. one wearing correctly. went get coffee yesterday customer ahead pulled mask ordered. What’s fucking point? Masks general measure lauded seen miracle prevention one bothered even tell people wear them. hell people pass nursing degree? Dude, same. Nightmares sleepless nights here. wife vaccinated, 20 month old can't be. happened son I'd never recover. die grief, I'd explode rage anti vaxers who've allowed spread. ICU rotations hear days, everyone beeping constantly, it’s Covid, Covid it’s almost always oxygen monitor. roll desat, cough hard desat, brain fog pull oxygen desat. crazy thing don’t feel it. managed catch highly vaccinated mask compliant state. I've vaccinated since January.

I told urgent care they're barely contact tracing beyond close associates. nurse told everywhere. send thoughts prayers to? gotta take trip post office.  Well, fair, band, take mask play, droplets fly really far wind/brass instruments... Imagine trombone... hard get vaccine early I'm fully vaccinated friends family. worry elderly parents getting infected unvaccinated kids, honestly risk worth them. feel way back parties without masks - vaccines chance serious illness within acceptable risk envelope.

You OC may confusing immunized vaccinated. good point things make small kids really sick. Kids weak immune systems cooped last 18 months too. There's always ye chance catch Covid something else ""routine"" time catching childhood illnesses along year. anti-vaxxers complained unemployment benefits government extended trouble COVID. worm turned. long unvaccinated, pose threat health everyone come contact. sympathy.

Yep trouble breathing high triage list. failure logical reasoning called [slippery bullshit argument.

GATFO. wonder also didn’t vaccinations well.

Dg pneumonia, got admitted. transported covid hospital even 3-4 steps take bed gurney almost much. could walk ER ok 5-6 hours later could barely walk 2 meters. would one ""excess deaths"" happened pandemic.  want ants? that's get ants. decline COVID cases recent days. think spells beginning end pandemic? people get infected build natural immunity, people get vaccines get immunity vaccines. people would built kind immunity point, right?  3/5 comments far don’t seem get this, let try explain. 

The humans Nobel people prize 2015 Ivermectin great Malaria, virus. Covid virus. evidence far ivermectin effective Covid. 

Human ivermectin humans. Livestock ivermectin livestock. Livestock ivermectin livestock stuff that’s humans. you’re human, don’t take livestock stuff. like don’t give dog human chocolate. 

Refugees treated human ivermectin treat parasitic worms, exactly it’s for. horse ivermectin. virus. Covid. Well, that’s understandable. Cases declined US 8 past 9 days compared day week earlier 7 day moving average 12 percent peak September 1 (using NYT data). Hospitalizations declining well. Impossible know goes seems one of, the, positive developments past two months. confirm almost died way baby. 47 year old sister still gets emotional tells story ice bath put in. long story short, daughter gets HIGH fevers sick take seriously, every single time. There’s lot grandmas the-conspiracy-that-cannot-be-named-here. might working better combined mandate tbh. mandate might getting unvaccinated people actually take vaccinations seriously, staying unvaccinated might lose jobs mandate causing pay attention current situation.

Counter-intuitively, mandate might kind open people persuasion. getting vaccinated path least resistance. suspect there's bunch people want see chaos and/or less people around trying spread misinformation means necessary. Let's get done please  factor Vietnam America. people saw casket arrivals, etc changed minds. Iraq War bit way. Seeing fallout visually really impactful. US nations outside Russia? share misinformation Canada too.

I think also ingrained sense individual rights vs group responsibility. least outsider US seems theme among resistance lot changes US gun control, healthcare, etc. know Jacinda Ardern uses Reddit. shows done! - IIRC Iceland higher uptake within EU/EEA (18+) 

The good news (2) EU reached 70% fully vaccinated along population (all ages) - US moved much, still around 52% :-(   I'm sure rest Africa, South Africa high rate HIV general population, compared countries 

It thought immunocompromised individuals, variants better chance evolving, virus sort hangs around longer time evolves, weakly battled someone weakened immune system. stats linked imply 20% population HIV, 92% aware, 75% treated, 92% virally suppressed, still leaves 7% entire population unchecked HIV (if reading orange purple chart page correctly), far larger rates countries, potentially allowing variants evolve way described.

It *super important* get population vaccinated. China authoritarian, soon started cutting things boarding people apartments knew shit fucked with.

It still baffles much people need deeply personal connection order understand threat covid is. That's pretty heavy man. Dang  Ah... Another rule mostly hurt already downtrodden. can't roll buttfluck North County school district first? Oh course, LE enforce rules teachers afraid Karyn.

I'm getting everyone vaccinated fair all. problem “letting naturally weaken out” killing people overwhelming hospitals. people emergencies can’t get care hospitals ICUs full covid patients. people drunk much Koolaid think they're best thing family getting it. delusional MIL claims people hospital COVID vaccinated vaccine killing many thousands people. people think that, follow they're afraid vaccine would harm children. awful, ridiculous thing people brainwashed every possible argument piece evidence give them, they'll interpretation explanation counter it, sometimes even personal experience change that. MIL husband recently recovered COVID. sick enough hospitalized, sick enough pneumonia feel miserable weeks. They're still getting vaccinated mind, get pneumonia COVID, *happened* test positive got *an unrelated bout pneumonia*. Thank God live 1000 miles away them. Exactly. also used take hour make baked potato. computers *pockets.* tens thousands labs involved didn’t start empty handed. already understand immunology viruses transmission vaccine development “variolation” began early 1700s! Africa primarily consists poor countries.

It’s way be, planet together. money talks, Africa doesn’t much countries.

It’s almost centuries colonial rule didn’t result good outcome. Wal-Mart sells Binax test kits $14 new Federal subsidies.. late sadly.   Covid floating visible thing (my brain picturing Koffing) randomly attacking people, we'd probably now. People would see visible, tangible threat react protect themselves....can't go party, look Covid stabbing people there.

It's similar send kids school sick go work sick can't tangibly see spread illness. previous years office, almost certainly flu serious cold work way 300 person building inconsideration.

9/11 tangible threat, still remember day vividly 20 years later. Covid pandemic worse basically every tangible metric people still arguing big deal, blows mind. Got vaccinated February flu shot yesterday. problems, even sore arm
with flu shot. I’ve years flu shot really sore arm, years not. really doubt long gone covid vaccine anything with. grandma ""an insane social media presence"" is...just so...wrong. know why, sentence scared me. like bo Burnham sing...there is, funny feeling.  Sadly lots people Florida care child. While, 7 coming positive might lead believe vaccines prevent infection, situation anecdotal. already much data point show fully vaccinated infected many times less (up 10+ times less) unvaccinated. So, less likely infect loved ones / kid. Secondly, end hospital mean might get strongly sick long term COVID symptoms (which less likely vaccine). 

So overall benefits vaccine decreased risk, outweigh temporary negatives vaccine.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* hope little girls sake, mother got tubes tied never contribute another senseless death due anti vaxx.  Yup! I’m American pro-vax come. stumble Facebook memes people speaking dangers vaccine/side effects, sparks fear me! start second-guessing vaccine safe! Even though *I know is* I’m already vaccinated. Yes, every person world opportunities, chance education, access healthcare, outcomes healthcare. don’t expect fully understand people’s lived experiences expect little empathy make attempt understanding people entirely different experience do. I’ve said another comment, interacting ignorant know all’s like reminds much interacting miseducated antivaxers. It’s passed trials standards MMR measles vaccines first approved. haven’t cut corners, there’s less time gaps studies.  saw stories coming China beginning pandemic, suspected would get bad, sent team remote work early/mid March.

But us developed countries inundated videos disaster around globe, famine, tsunamis, war, disease. There’s always cause give to, people help. time, develops sense things going far away.

When rip away people’s long developed sense specialness, lot go deep denial even lash out. takes time energy tease it. part goes “fuck them, let die”, that’s really what’s going happen. Instead, survive, hospitals get overwhelmed, create generation broken deeply scarred health care workers decades probably living streets much like veterans past wars, bulk lasted crisis riding wave denial even entrenched beliefs, willing vote people support false narrative.

So, think behooves us work set record straight, convince can, try make things better. It’s frustrating hell, convince even small handful people get vaxxed, maybe that’s one less patient icu team deal with, maybe that’ll save life innocent patient got stroke wrong time, child whose parents refused let get vaxxed, bit sanity struggling nurse doctor.

I want contribute solution. add problem. It’s easy feels good vent, put deniers box call “depl********”, dont think that’s entirety solution. Unfortunately could abused way drug dogs are. think places made J&amp;J recipients eligible mRNA booster could wrong

The city San Francisco rolled out, think US. doctor NC hard-line stance current CDC recommendation mix match vaccine types approved J&amp;J booster yet, sorry good luck. agree though, J&amp;J shot still good vaccine highly effective severe illness. gave toxic ""Facebook snake oil"" treatment kind accelerated death, could imagine they're keeping low avoid CPS investigation (which would FULLY justified). conservative states try make exception? Cause succeed, they’re gonna move south totally respect that. That's interesting get financial incentive, must outside states one ass-backward states least. believe non-southern states offered $100 per recommendation federal government (still chump change, imo). employer also offer financial reward, also vaccine clinic offered way back March got soon could. Again, respect position, perhaps financial incentives look likely since ""stick"" part carrot stick anology. I'm done answering misleading inane questions since clearly want star show. Everything asked nothing current events situation hand. Trying point fingers misleading study mistakes one country's government two years ago absolutely nothing what's happening world. clearly want discussion since refused answer questions, despite pushing answer yours. Would better videos people dying mass, bodies piled due Covid. aired TV start get idiots understand. Humans stupid nature, clearly need stick vs carrot approach. Comparing events side: targeted attack country vs COVID flu.

When someone attacks country take personal offense. someone gets sick weak. take much pride mindset.  Where's joke? Germany 67 approved vendors at-home rapid-tests, US 2. also found 1/4 price. bureaucratic nonsense detrimental public health.

Classification tests medical devices means subject FDA authorization. classified public health good overseen CDC/NIH. Maybe true some, cant imagine majority. people know Covid related public health measures genuinely dont care virus. Also keep mind still people even smoking cigarettes drinking large amounts alcohol, though even likely lead death getting vaccinated Covid. really apathy towards virus surprised us. anyone flu shot season post vaccine? got vaccine February, way long ago. Yesterday went flu shot (I work school administer pretty early) got shot arm vaccine. arm hurts horribly like got vaccine. know timeline far apart, I’ve never reaction flu shot like life. feels like arm fallen asleep aches aches. curious anyone else like both. Yes,and main point none new. find best information going forward look immunologists said vaccines rolled out. still wear n95 masks every time go still try go that's position consistently. say things solution well mean meant absolute way. said ""part of"", time limited comment terse. 

I think new variant spreading something current wave. lot places problems places never really shutdown wore masks anyways, except Walmart made them. said, know people think safe started going wearing mask. uncle (I actually multiple uncle's, think necessary mention comment) intubated right probably (assuming he's still alive) he's one people. problem safety features often: wear helmet drivers pass closely, example. vaccinated would avoided this. Four kids. makes zero sense me. Selfishness become new American Patriots. One, get tested, possible cold way know.

Two, yes, fellow J&amp;J recipient lack info real world efficacy, boosters, etc extremely frustrating. However limited data come reassuring. wish third party analysis J&amp;Js work though.

To specific, [J&amp;J induced antibodies seem stick around least 6-9 [retains antibody activity Delta, including 85% efficacy severe/critical 60% efficacy actually [similar mRNA effectiveness Delta six months 

From point view lack publicly available follow-up info J&amp;J terrible, sooner get actual clear guidance boosters better, still good vaccine well prevent bad outcomes. think worth panicking about, ever authorize boosters I'll getting one soon able. submission linking businessinsider.com automatically removed source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* We’ll see works mention whether vaccinated, likely not. 4 children ages 14, 13, 7 6.
 
And there's Go Fund Me. 

I'm seeing more, I'm growing peeved live first world country people denying expert medical care others wish for. 

And putting load hospitals, care systems, finances. dealing covid orphans.

How many people would cringe taxes families need help various reasons due fault own, taking huge amounts resources, infecting/killing people refuse vaccine? Dogs, gift keeps giving asks food belly rubs. Well must work healthcare, least hope don’t judgmental comment was. It’s really weird believe people actually take it! remember Dad heaps body builders buying testosterone farm supplies job. can’t get some. find strange hear Bobby Kennedy banned platforms reaction is, see must reason want silenced! Crazy worrying. sister refusing let kids vaccinated I’m scared stiff get it.   Studies Europe show vaccine refusal fairly even across political scale, except extreme nationalist right several times higher vaccine refusal.

The nationalist right make 14% vote, make majority anti vaxers Wow, even local water park need mandate vaccines! Crazy think many places would apply to. Hope works. would take virus REALLY long time rid world blue eyes situation. 

Blue eyes results two recessive genes, virus would able remove ""single"" blue gene, paired eye color gene. gene would remain population expressed paired another blue gene later generation.

If chosen brown ( dominant) eyes example would better. I'm surprised; people understand genetics natural selection anti vaxxer general. every parent know whether long-term effects level COVID-19 infection unvaccinated child might cause child, months years infection, develop lifetime learning disabilities cognitive impairments, heart problems, lung problems, kidney problems, organ problems, infertility, birth defects child's offspring, serious health outcomes, loving, caring, realistic parents decide medically eligible child fully vaccinated.  Survivorship bias playing huge role sure.

They tend bend knee right late machine takes last breath though. Neanderthals creative, empathetic, excellent hunter-gatherers. people none above. saying quite bit last two years folks “doing best skills resources God gave them” understanding many, that’s lot. Always assume ignorance malice. Goof vaxed open it. might scum he's stupid. Live block away 2000+ student high school SF. told wife shocked masked high schoolers are. expected rip masks second school. so! Bravo! Exactly people yelling reason. around decades third week school ended today 6 year old sitting next couch stuffed coughing.  🤦 school also mask mandate send N95s eat outside. 

BinaxNOW rapid test negative. Got booked PCR tomorrow CVS, fingers crossed.    Quitting = resignation note.

Suggesting quit = forgery/fraud. going that. That's stupid even suggest commiting crime.

Employers options fire layoff here. Would travel away 6 elk he’s sitting on? blame ya. Non-voters 3rd party voters get blamed every election go way Republicrats want, prepared demonized ;) Covid actually looks like family members, coworkers, neighbors, ultimately ourselves. people can't handle. vaccinated never get covid thank God Evidence employee unwilling comply regulations = quitting = unemployment. even want it. want leech society, right? Ooh weee. Reality gonna slap one hard. Yeah cause fuck freedom. turned FoxNews earlier week prime time hour see going about. doctor explaining vaccines causing variants people old skip go natural immunity way end pandemic.

I swear, 99% experts believe one thing Fox find 1% believes opposite promote them. Welcome employment building session 7 days sent numerous kids home symptoms two teachers positive today. Elementary school, mask mandate shitty air flow filtration. Getting vaccine undo immunity virus. speak pediatrician, getting vaccinated helps protect family others.  good idea immune systems work. Research always performed mechanisms disease labs around United States rest world. goes even years there’s pandemic. Get many vaccines want. You’ll fine. He's mandating vaccines, that's great me. Anti vaxxers ”gubmint bad” idiots, surely ask unemployment. Cuz, know…gubmint bad 🙄 Dogs get covid though... ""Wait, mean step outside air trying murder me???"" get wrong. I've since gotten needed vaccines (including covid) mom convinced safe. Enjoy 98% survival rate. That's nice, safe number. 2% chance. 1 50 chance die.

Don't think chance severe complications. permanent damage lungs, brain, heart. unknown chance depends many factors, ultimately roll dice.

Don't think chance hospitalization kill you. Ventilators save life, maybe, comfortable.

Don't think chance spreading COVID others also roll dice.

If thought things, might worried chances COVID. don't. Keep saying there's 98% survival rate. simple, easy, removes complications consideration. actual cubicles 5 foot walls least 10 years company I've worked for. long tables 4 people side. walls people except monitors center table.

I think going work well covid far, office optional changed return office date later several times.    put kit people already looking potential treatment. origin used covid that. Dont know, talking idea purchasing lot them, much making like...drip videos...out many. heh   Vaccinate dogs please.  It’a constructive dismissal.

Which essentially means government rules layoff.

Companies used avoid paying severance unemployment. block government contracts (you’re normally able bid you’ve laid anyone past year two). Doesn’t really work anymore.

You generally fire layoff someone. Otherwise unemployment office make determination you. Lack evidence proper firing = layoff = unemployment. me! I’ve knocked ass week. Fatigued, cold sweats, waking puddles sweat, much appetite. Covid test came back negative, urgent care told there’s lot different viruses going around. seemed get better, I’m young, fit dude. fever symptoms finally reduced week, last 2 days I’ve stomach pains shortness breath guess. Idk it’s related sweating, I’ve also itchy af?

Probably going back Urgent Care tomorrow, shit crazy, never really get sick either. Haven’t able work workout. Doesn’t help live FL everything’s shitshow girl talk elementary school teacher, new Covid cases students neighboring classes popping multiple per day. Heart breaking. COVID clotting issue, respiratory issue, makes sense stillbirths happen. Clotting placenta=no oxygen baby. Nah, know it’s last years traveled country doctor made sure got it. Yeah, I’ve TB test internship hospital.  One Betta spend shifts sniffing face coverings employees passing checkpoint detect presence virus sweat, breath scents due metabolic changes virus causes human body. dog signals odor virus person, individual asked take rapid coronavirus test, airport said. 
        
The preceding paragraph poorly written. think might accurate read, ""If dog signals odor metabolic changes — sweat, breath scents resulted virus infection — individual asked take rapid coronavirus test, airport said.""  Can't get someone like Nick Saban PSAs vaccine? He's anti-vax, he? Alabama people love sportsball coaches? Florida right work state. Yeah, employers fire need reason!! Hope did! lot first go round/last school year. kid 2 within first week school.  people opposed vaccine actually opposed social reasons. belong family, social groups opposed vaccines associated mandates politics it.

Almost none people shred interest medicine. teens Quebec. 15th comply want sports. 

(My teen kids fully vaccinated since July, waiting green light youngest) every ivermectin story, come concern trolls. used COVID outside well designed controlled clinical trials. science fully understood yet still hypothesis. also important remember vaccines developed designed quickly distributed possible administered prevent hospitalization only. think flaw study assumes groups takes preventative measures far masks social distancing goes .

I mean probably directionally true , know anti vaxxers mask lot less vaccinated. Also JNJ given lot poorer groups , especially homeless.

Its ok study , feeling effetiveness slightly less stated difference vaccines also slightly less  Oh lord, please submit soon! 3rd day daughters kindergarten class little besties went home Covid symptoms. guess see well eating lunch outside 3 feet apart kn94 masks actually work. hope Canada follows fast. want child vaccinated! sniffing mask? great idea, given dogs get infected... That's actually quite responsible teenagers... especially vaccinated well. Don’t know specifically, one local hospitals posts daily deaths 9ish Tuesday today 9ish 13. Don’t know people hospital takes people surrounding counties. Last week 20.

Edit….there 70 august. Yes theory, pediatrician groups specifically, strongly advised that. I'm sure doctors DL, vast majority advising wait EUA. likely legal risks many willing face.  I've read, Florida reporting deaths certificates processed filed. seem purposely slow-walking process. 200 people die given day, they'll report handful certificates processed day. 

The numbers September 10 accurate two weeks one looking Sept 10 anymore. They're necessarily lying, they're certainly obfuscating truth way procedural BS.  I’m moving uk couple weeks we’re getting rigs picked Paris get transported. I’ve worried they’d ban Americans. janky ass paper card system, would hard blame anyone trusting Americans’ vaccination statuses. Vaccines can't sold else drug companies profiting sickness citizens. allowed earth :( probably bullshit get temporary federal contract company friends started 3 months ago. Knock, Knock. der? Deez. Deez who? DEEZ NUTZ!!! GOT IHHHHH!!!!   hand data comes similar conclusion. particular, data South Africa recently J&amp;J 71% hospitalization. bad, still significantly worse vaccines. health systems collapse, deaths shrink ventilators bad? State Texas give shot, provider does. one cross-checking vaccinating. maybe true doesn’t make original statement made natural immunity vs vaccine immunity, replied, true. We'll get herd immunity, without them. Delta Delta? Who? responsible? vaccinated 15 years ago? Cuz that's long normally take much hating people welfare ""socialism"" yet hands second's notice handouts socialized medicine everyone else foot bill for. Poop blocks article wild we're seeing evolution play super speed. [It started go bad Yeah, see problem here. start GoFundMe. I'm sure they'll fine. We've hearing canine Covid detection since literally start pandemic. things never seem make beyond pilot/trial programs Given I’m 100%sure company watching closely, sweet, kick road. ever see cubicle ptsd flare damn bad…   Wish school district could get one! Sniffs covid spreads good cheer. much fun nasal swabs saliva tests! make poor stupid choices. one people never want go back office working 20 years corporate America, embraced working home since Covid started. love time meetings, concentrate work without disruptions, grab food eat, go sit deck 15 minutes get sunshine think. better employee productive. 

I conversation today co-worker thinks things back ""normal"" corporate America 3 years, saying believes working back office again. said, way, job done remote believe hybrid work environment embraced post-covid world widely accepted working home 3 years now. 

I curious others think. corporate America us working back office 3 years? hybrid work model stay?

Also, generation play part this? baby boomer cusp genX millenial. Well, band camp wild perhaps instead .. like go school physically  Seriously, adults parents age older seriously toxic. kids listening science find actual sources information better ""adults""... lowest IQ take vaccine I've seen. saw gallery grandmother's anti-mask/anti-vac conspiracy nonsense elsewhere reddit couple days ago. spouting absolute nonsense, followed self-centered announcement granddaughter's death.

I think grandmother claimed little girl asthma something. probably correct.

Either way heartbreaking tragic. parents least extended family really let kid flaunting common sense precautions. dead needlessly.

It's also terrifying slipped away quickly. Pretty sure saw neighbour throw excrement son 2 days ago, yard also can’t easily prevented single, safe, effective treatment.


They're lot easily preventable: smoke text drive.

According CDC smoking leading preventable cause death US.  2 group though. course Americans would use 9/11 unit measure. Kentucky Derby. I'm worm free.  welcome defect North Korea jeering grandmother's passing. connected someone wearing mask, respect voice kid.

It get straightforward than, ""hey guys, serious issue let's take seriously. see impact close network i'm telling happening neighborhood. family torn this.""

Selfish people realize what's irresponsible affects them. bad can't shunt non-maskers one school maskers another. Really depends per source look percentage total population percentage people eligible vaccinated. good see number still growing.. It’s like unibrowed cousin delta that’s going anywhere  Tell electrolytes plants crave. way. break jaw Battle Big Beaver?   bit late sound like Florida Man all.

Would nice know Moderna ever going plan FDA approval coast EUA till pandemic ends? Song Everyone's DNA different could neither vaccinated. Also. Everyone health issues lack of. statement means nothing.  guarantee another pandemic hits close one ends America vaccine hesitant.

I doubt it. could polio spanish flu happen time today still people denial number deaths right now, 18 months pandemic infecting people will. Nah. Fuck that. big part problem doctors don’t educate patients safety classification drugs pregnant women. reality drugs specifically studied pregnant women prove safety. addition challenge recruiting participants smaller population, also serious ethical concerns running controlled trials among pregnant women.

Most drugs proved safe pregnant women. Class b c drugs describe known ill effects humans, meaning “among pregnant women need drug, adverse effects observed.” felt concern taking class b c drug clear health benefit. drugs include common drugs like amoxicillin.

The problem people don’t understand choices class drugs. things put bodies aren’t guaranteed safe pregnant women. Absent evidence they’re harmful, doctors clear compelling benefit avoiding Covid far outweighs teensy bit uncertainty.

TLDR; there’s basically drug doctor say proved safe women, context part evaluating risk. Actually Israel pretty much fully vaxed cases skyrocketing.  Same. really depressing. changed me. hardass union like do. 

Organized labour many benefits, able fire bad employees huge PITA.

Which bad point really need pretty serious purging ranks want restore trust. Weird happens politicize medical science.. case yes feel like sick already scared preventive mask+ Look, agree majority saying, wholeheartedly. think acknowledge fact major terror attack US soil since. think flat say effective. quickly forget attacks thwarted. Now, whether worth it, that's different story. Again, sure correct answer is, think confidently say impoverishing people *not* answer. People agency. certain point, need feel secure fact you’re vaccinated worry much aren’t. population can’t get vaccinated, still face transmission risks amongst vaxxed. It’s unfortunate, pandemic, reality people might vulnerable others wait till darling 4yo scalds boiling water hospital ER overwhelmed unvaccinated covid cases.

Will still chortling then? Please show parents thread, would extremely interesting hearing thoughts. work acute care? Like EM / Crit care? You’re young realize don’t know yet. You’ve never talk loved ones. Empathy understanding people brainwashed despite fact they’re calling liar face still best best exceed standard care (whatever point). corticosteroids, mabs present within appropriate time frame, pressors start decompensate, airway protection (pretty aggressive intubation path they’re hypo hypoxic, gotta careful blockade choice though, especially they’re stuporous yet) unit take care ECMO time comes rule age/ risk factors prognosis. don’t know don’t know kid. live? practice pediatric ER California seen flu yet. I'm trying time kids' flu shot correctly. probably even worse hospitalized.

Thats started tilting again.

Nope. Cases started going exponentially last week September (there lag week two time infection time people get tested start showing data, several days lag seen 7-day trailing average). thankfully stared low baseline, took 6–8 weeks numbers start reach alarming level. Uh, no. matters spread others. Positive test = get groceries delivered. stop trolling. username says all. gift keeps giving  got first southern state second midwestern state zero issues Yes. matter know approved drugs treat Covid anyways.

Let's attack grieving mother here. I'm suggesting empower make difference! always done stringent protocols like n95s gowns iso zones sit around listen pumps beep and

How ignorant say this? wrong you? know many doctors paramedics died trying urge asshole dimwits infact frolicking outside without mask? Lol they've always done? Yes always die droves they? pumps beep click orders EMR delay inevitable? Don’t lecture toll takes watch another human succumb illness.

I clearly fking idea worst thing people like even fking REALISE stupid advocacy room temp iq behaviour is. haven’t even taken MCAT, GRE. idea.

Thank you, know can't actually say anything relevant topic without seeming like fool decided read post history. literally know nothing me, parents high profile doctors lost numerous colleagues idiots think entire circumstance sort charade. Ironical still know nothing say know exactly kind person are. 

It's also even funnier think know empathy even though entire Last reply un-empathetic shit u could write. 

The human race victim nonsensical stupid people virus much covid. Stop vectors disease. bet they're people think quit job choose live unemployment, that's reason shitty jobs struggling hire people.

Which also people scream cashiers things control over, laugh people able survive poverty wages CEO building penis rockets, say, ""If want better treatment get better job!"" mean, give people high enough doses people *of COVID*.

They'll die organ failure issues caused invermectin overdose. COVID.

Maybe thats 100% effectiveness mean.  two illnesses eradicated. would surprising vaccines end it. Maybe San Francisco allow people build like crazy move San Francisco. Fully fifth Americans fucking stupid. lot social pressure cases like ... know *public* health works pretty well ICQ gang checking 5 year old also can’t wait vaccine! knows waiting “the doctors say it’s ok”. infecting children virus trying learn live host longer, course kill it’s host. Anyone still masks children? can't believe middle pandemic governor crew choosing waste effort on. still nightmares last job, 10 years since quit. enemy enemy friend. Thats vaccination cards. usually got influenza booster every year, pneumoccocus booster every 5, tetanus booster every 10, etc. take together needed would mind adding yearly. Also, would awesome able vaccinate ebola AIDS.  people. Americans. many Japanese Koreans see exhibiting behavior? Perhaps comes COVID using metaphor oxygen deprivation? Penicillin really good antibiotic, whose discoverer Nobel Prize. mean works viruses. almost like different medicines different uses, trying use unproven treatment buying veterinary medicine doctor prescribe incredibly stupid. 2 weeks Poor thing, I'm glad got better. virus still scares shit me... primarily gotten yet.  Hopefully everyone make good threats quit.  yup another comment section full non-COVID related Police hatred wonderful website... glad Twitter/Reddit reflective actual US public believe get furious people say children wear masks better adults. children same. young child obey, adults say ""because told so"". son recently hospital major metro area, several hospitals area room him. took almost 12 hours find room people waiting outside get ER. Similar Israel, good them. GoFundMe time! Exactly. opposed countries. cute think i'm mad all. 

you really can't read people all.. I'm suprised since can't even comprehend prized primary sources support outlook. thing happened. can’t find anything answer question. It’s good question though. Similar stories 18 months. convinced yet, doubt one make difference, matter heartbreaking. 


Your heart broken one... anti-American trolls upvoting every town idiot. first comment listen primary source. changed. need grow anything say lol. definitely learned mad reddit thread lol. bro covid hitting black people bother making rushing vaccine  saw buy one get one chain vitamin store. source that? proof need deadly virus  wonderful thing deeply held religious belief take vaccine whatever happens, God provide even means significant personal sacrifice, part God's plan.   knows got reported.

But instead accepting blame whatever said, lying swearing fact original ""primary source"" shared support say, blame someone else.

Accept wrong grow it.  Err, partner's mother. shitty thing even political, mean lacking many political opinions. nurse Florida though, threatening work restaurant fire her. 

Honestly, idea anti-vax bs came from, getting shingles vax next month. Now, try engage partner talks mother stuff, seems like lot doctors specific hospital anti-vax too. really get it.  Bro talking comment got removed. Damn, really taking like life death situation huh.  think ""relatively fine"" means invincible?

Sure, everything's relatively fine not. Hmm, maybe clot got her.  swear words. Looks like can't take heat snitching. Ooof

Screenshot swearing deny again.

[The CDC considers county high risk 100 cases per 100,000 per **week**. average 25 per 100K per day would 175 per 100K per week. CDC's standards, safe zip indicates mRNA vaccines approximately 90% effective severe outcomes COVID-19 including hospitalization, ICU admission, death. 

From username I'm assuming almost 40. risk may well still higher unvaccinated children. vaccine reduces risk factor 10, risk originally 10x risk children face, could still higher absolute risk.  Yes, that's TV2 vaccination page, using groups vaccinated, includes combinations ages (e.g., 20-24 + 40-49 years) couple without age (e.g. healthcare workers, therefore included age groups), make direct comparisons difficult. official vaccination page SSI that, pure age groups, spanning 10 years. thing worth noting lowest use 10-19 years, meaning substract 135K 10-11 year olds currently can't vaccinated. 1905 case ruled vaccine mandate violate 1st Amendment.

Also, state hospitalized covid general. get car wreck go hospital, another tally vaccinated line? Good Lmaoooo Lets see popular cruise ports REALLY see significant shift among anti-vaxxer turds. summary takeaway points.

Moderna trialing vaccine booster shot called mRNA-1273.351 targeted toward Beta South African variant, contains mutation E484K, able avoid lot antibodies produced vaccines/natural immunity Wuhan strain.

Since started developing shot, Delta variant outcompeted variants mutation, might make variants seem like old news. recently version Delta includes similar E484Q mutation discovered. could give variant booster shot new relevance.

Here takeaways vaccines elicited strong neutralizing responses spike variants, though mRNA-1273.351 produced two-fold higher geometric mean titer (GMT) Beta [South African] variant, four-fold lower D614G variant. neutralizing activity Delta variant reduced four- five-fold vaccines higher dose, ten-fold lower dose.

So: booster better Beta variant E484K mutation designed target, apparently better ""D614G variant"" [sic?]. D614G mutation, variant, actually Beta variant holds mutation too, I'm sure they're talking about. Alpha variant holds D614G mutation, (usually) E484 mutation, perhaps that's could refer activity seen strong immunized mice higher dose, lower mRNA-1273.351 D614G D614G/N501Y strains [Alpha, compared unmodified vaccine. converse true viruses E484K mutations. equally active Delta strain, though titers lower compared observed variants.

So again, ""equally good"" Delta (read: better original vaccine it), better variants E484K mutation, good Alpha.

What take away turning game wack-a-mole. New variant-specific boosters could useful specific variant designed target, could perhaps even less effective new variants relative original vaccine. That's discouraging. hope variant-specific boosters immune systems exposed to, better bodies would get tackling variants general class viruses. far as?

It never started 100%. I've literally never seen claim.

With large vaccinated population, especially one that's still increasing, would also expect breakthrough infections increase proportionally, albeit would still minority infections.

Or, look UK's data despite reopened weeks already:

[Data Public Health England suggest double vaccinated reduces risk hospital admission now-dominant delta variant around 96%.

Step 2: Go get vaccinated return said job traveler multiple times previous wage

It however considered likely temporary effect would last first couple months completing vaccination, hopefully expected booster doses create something least moderately durable.  beyond true. recently got discussion one presented facts showing wrong reply ""don't link articles, I'm linking any, nothing say change mind""

True vaccinated along taking precautions would significantly reduced possibility catching COVID subsequently passing onto daughter. 

While can’t say certain due limited amount information article; guess family mindset COVID overblown kids don’t get sick case devastating consequences. 

So vaccine precautions like mask wearing offer 100% protection significantly reduced likelihood catching COVID. case someone young vaccinated known respiratory issues family vaccinated; resulted mother catching COVID likely passing onto daughter resulted daughters death. something mother along rest family live rest lives honestly bear burden death. sons head always hot af? back head radiates heat temp always normal.

more link wow Israel's vaccination percentage Canada's almost same. hear lot people Canada saying happening Israel happen here, never good explanation think relevant differences are.

One difference aware amount time doses two countries (Canada took longer). Another recency last dose (Israel earlier) waning protection. latter would mean matter time though Canada experiences surge cases. amount time doses enough warrant predicting entirely different outcome?

Vaccines highly effective serious illness even get big wave deadly previous ones. anyone give rationale predicting Canada experience Israel experiencing, I'd interested hear it. still baffles much people need deeply personal connection order understand threat covid is.

A severe lack imagination arms-length empathy dangerous thing. comment replied deleted can't see responding to. context I'd assume asking 'fully vaccinated' means? so, US tools (like CDC) count individually fully vaccinated receiving full complement doses + time delay efficacy. example pfizer, would count person fully vaccinated doses plus two weeks. I'm calling stupidity man. 0 idea talking about. can't imagine like living fairy tale. making random shit calling someone out, think.... Could useful. eat shit. 🤷 Literally boss said zoom call he’s gonna sell fake vaccine cards fellow employees team went quiet. got hit - Covid PCR test day symptoms showed 5-year old came back negative.  previous posters - nasty upper respiratory virus. think good chunk class got sick it. Vaccinated parents also getting sick. We're assuming Covid, everyone's testing negative.   disparaging aunt particular, but…

“I’m going live fear.”

Then many guns? Oh right, “home defense” “personal protection”…. you’re afraid, riiiight?!!! There's crapload anti-vax videos German Youtube contribute this. girlfriend's parents also trapped negative spiral constantly send nonsense videos family app swear them. Contrary this, younger people know Germany vaccinated. 

As Dutch person always wondered Germany higher death ratio per inhabitant (since way less people infected) guess anti-vaxx sentiment among boomers old people way stronger don’t think addressed here. study simply demonstrates safe people who’ve GBS past get mRNA vaccine.

""***they*** keep repeating statements made authorities calling people idiots believing them"" (here, ***they*** clearly refer authorities)

 
Let clarify: never said authorities calling idiots. I'm referring pro-vax people social media/friends/family members, etc. vax-hesitant people trust authorities reasons XYZ, nothing authorities say matter trust reestablished. done pro-vax people authorities, instead addressing source mistrust, repeat authorities say shut form open discussion. 

Yes, government tried inform people, objectively, messaging terrible. tried approach (but definitely approach I'm suggesting) tell people believe keep repeating things allow little room people raise concerns/genuine questions.

Checked recent numbers Sweden 5 kids bracket 0-9 years old died Covid. 4 kids 10-19 years old group. total number died positive Covid diagnosis Sweden 14703 talking comparatively tiny number. Drowning common cause death kids Covid example.

Others may think differently personally see reason vaccinate kids statstics mind. guess primary argument would would lower transmission, protect groups, science seems unclear (I'm vaccinating protecting risk groups elderly vaccines, want point out). even offered yes way. know many people could ""on fence"" anymore numbers probably much higher. send kids home symptoms don’t know parents keep home 10 days 24 hours symptoms end without providing negative test.

Can imagine? are, still. bet ass got vaccinated soon could. Yank, get either. mean weren’t Delta variant, we’d likely already situation considering positive things looking back April-May. everything read nothing dangerously rushed, expedited prioritized.  

Honestly, don’t particularly care FDA green lights vaccine. scientific community whole opportunity evaluate data consensus it’s deemed safe effective, I’d get shot today.  Well here’s thing.

Secondly, ""make sure take once"", ""don't miss boosters"" etc? Sorry I'm taking medical advice anonymous strangers neither you. 

Thirdly, agree slippery slope taxation going handle healthcare costs. I'm satisfied current situation there's certainly chance going bankrupt medical bills unless live somewhere like India USA! That's extreme think societies far far removed from.

And agree, trust science. randomers. take refused PUP too? offense, son actually covid 3 times one year, vaccine would likely done absolutely nothing him, obviously seroconverting It’s people sick covid effected. boyfriend’s father unbeknownst us developed heart condition contracting asymptomatic covid. 

He found heart condition passing driving flipping car six times. He’s ICU broken neck new pacemaker. blessed live area high vaccine rates ICU okay. it’s clear ICU staff worked burnt out. 

Because covid one person allowed see one hour time. terrible deal non-pandemic times. quality care ability help severely stifled due pandemic it’s fucking terrible. Countless negatives guess that's true everywhere. 

Let's see - vicious neoliberalism throughout 1990s 2000s led de-regulation Irish banking sector (oversight etc); nepotism cronyism every level politics; terrible public transportation European standards; weather usually wet windy; insanely high rent housing prices; high costs living; high cost car insurance (If get quote right would like €2000/yr); generally conservative-minded people put Catholic Church scandals demand anything them.

I'm sure there's many more, love Irish living here, sometimes... damn like... can't riot once? dead cats thrown apartment buildings people afraid could spread COVID... *oldest* Gen-Xers 50s, youngest Baby Boomers, yes, know use computers, lol. slow-loading/intermittent internet like me, might take long time show since video near bottom page. boat showed five minutes. Makes difference me. wear face masks properly social-distance properly whether lockdown.

Practically nobody else workplace does, even lockdown. carry usual, even staff social gatherings - completely breach rules.

We're deemed ""essential"", stay open regardless. Nobody allowed work home. Life Denmark almost completely normal since around May restrictions. Mask mandates lifted beginning June, schools full capacity since may, full football stadiums since start august, nightclubs open two weeks, kids back school month without restrictions social distancing……and cases steady past 6 months actually dropping now. Latest reproduction rate 0.7. 

We definitely expecting cases rise autumn, removing restrictions would profound effect, would seen long time ago. Im irish fully vaccinated, lets gooo 311 whole country? That's wild.

FYI, blue area outside DC already high vaccination rates. non story area.

Which coronavirus outbreaks? use ivermectin SARS MERS. think making new hospital less week huge thing. even “hit” U.S. hit everything came along like China. surreal seeing homeland Denmark people also less fat, bet must help also Today tough day.

Back home hospital beds, anything happens family, get seen quickly. seen terrible stuff, worrying family right keeping trauma experienced. I’ve covid, I’m fully vaccinated (both doses), **and** I’m getting booster I’m immunocompromised. 

That’s actually folks like get **any** protection. 

So saying vaccines would nothing ol’ dude wild presumption. also contradicts link, current data CDC/WHO guidelines. 

We don’t know sh-t guy’s ability inability seroconvert. vaccine immunity complicated simple seroconversion. supermarket, sure, restaurants bars packed maskless here. use passports (which admittedly aren’t enforced places).  What’s studied two injections, smaller doses adult doses.  difference is, science hide people adverse reactions vaccines. people *always* adverse reactions vaccines. stay vaccination location time receiving one. matter COVID vaccine, flu vaccine, tetanus shot, anything else. So, anti-vaxxers celebrating adverse reactions celebrating water wet... drink water.

Whereas trying dissuade people using veterinary medicines treat illness *because work* celebrated. means less people hospitalized, less people die. wonder many Americans understand ""exponentially"" mean. Damn. sympathies.  Yeah watching made break down, maybe I'm home ""walls"" up. never ""feel"" anything listening work, guess suppress fuck it. Maybe Mississippi teachers vote feet, move different state. know anti-vaxx teachers, nurses, doctors, etc.. let anti-vaxx people replace Mississippi, pro-vaxx teachers, nurses, doctors, etc., move somewhere else. take realistically move Europe? $100,000? Nova Scotia, Canada, here. follow suit. Fingers crossed!  best mask one picture Chris Whitty saying ""Next slide please!"" much cost go off-roading? No. government considering another lockdown. 

There ~30 people oxygen, 7 ICU. 500 cases days, almost asymptomatic. 

It’s incredibly frustrating. Man, work ER ICU experience long haul you, video made spontaneously ugly cry. cried last 18 months something one triggered something me. hear alarms I'm home, I'm trying go sleep, shower, I'm somewhere ambient noise often feel like almost hear red alarms vent alarm. doubt lot us PTSD this, think really *know* can't think reason I'd strong reaction. Oh yeah. Poorly phrased. sick sure would. isnt super fucked means, higher education system unimpressive. kids one day go university may want make plans advance study nearby country like England, Germany Sweden. That's fairly standard style guide thing. Numbers 10 (or sometimes 12) rendered words, numbers higher numerals. finally stop taking shoes airport, least? 20 years! Irish person here. suffer bullshit easily. people see right it.  unvaccinated go public, putting children mortal risk, even though I'm vaccinated never leave house. like getting drunk driving car living room, illegal. worse that, deny covid even last breaths *is* true young people. vast majority young people absolutely fine get it. problem become reservoir disease spread older people. argument harder sell people, reason. 

I desperately want people get vaccinated, sometimes people overplay deadliness young people. get worried exaggerated arguments counterproductive. suggest exaggerating, people video targeted young people. That’s ridiculous.

If genuinely believe that, there’s nothing I’m going say change opinion.  Right corona detector!  plan target opening everything planned? Proper education would preserved reasonable alternative party. Fact is, desegregation, intentional corruption republicans warped whole philosophy. came race issues 90s (Rodney King, etc) went deep end. 

I calculus professor Ukraine late 90s. school Alabama. worked hard get US found fundamental corruption education system. confided, one one, thought conspiracy dumb American students. specific reasoning predictions. time, nodded ""uh huh""d him. Looking back, absolutely right, everything predicted happened.

edit: bot said Ukraine, Ukraine. Apologies mistake. hard find friends apparently. look good.  citizens didn’t choose old, denied care. seems grossly unfair compare two different treatments.

I made comment treatment elderly pandemic Sweden.

I make one though, goes: consider well enough read subject clear opinion.

My impression worth could protected elderly much better pandemic first hit Sweden. let Covid ravage carehome facilities( sure English name are). pandemic could handled lot better sure.

About denied care, know. read that. problem Singapore 81% vaccination rates. Yep. short supply time. shots came used pretty much instantly. bunch great lads Ireland. mean?

You keep trying new experts find one agrees opinion. /s We'll never know inherently, even masks schools poorly ventilated folks dont wear N95s and/or take mask sometimes, leakages fairly common. person schooling isnt safe covid rates high really want move Ireland emigrating US, especially poor, damned hard.  OMG social media rescue. problem would without covidiots social media first place. experts universally say pregnant women get vaccinated.

two options: 

1) can't seroconvert

2) never happened citizens didn’t choose old, denied care. seems grossly unfair compare two different treatments. 

We don’t want *prioritize* people chose trust science protect others. Y’all didn’t even let elderly hospital, much less keep ventilators weeks. 

**America isn’t leaving unvaccinated untreated. We’re angry them** hurting us, healthcare workers need. 

And understand many see American life support/heroic measures cruel. I’ve heard ICU doctors nurses. I’m condemning Sweden’s decision, going point out: we’re made people *made continuous ongoing choice would take fifteen minutes rectify*. alcoholic overnight person smoker gang member need months years community support change attributes.

ETA: many still unvaccinated patients abusive staff, claiming doctors killing aren’t sick Covid, spitting nurses, suing hospitals trying care them. Luck Irish. brains healthcare all. big cities bad, large rural population low rates heavily weighting statewide average down. Austin San Antonio pretty high, almost 90%. Rollout boosters slow transmission rates among crowd.  woman seen laughing nurse apparently spoken pandemic related meetings. read yesterday identified, well employer, terminated job. happened “trust experts”? I'd fine people dying think politics team sport except making pandemic worse Lol Yep. even we’re still acting like risks Florida. 

It’s… something. 

(I’ll still gladly stay Bay though.) There’s anti vax/anti mask “it’s flu” family elementary school class. got fed mask mandates two weeks removed kids homeschool. parents (and faculty deal constant grievances) happy dance “we research don’t need precautions masks” lifestyle pretty likely bring illness class. mean half class already missed school due various back school illness. One less risky vector community. Glad they’re gone. kept uneducated purpose keep voting republican. modicum education critical thinking skills would voting them. 

Not saying education pushes anyone arms dems, they'd think twice casting vote party particular. years ago read article antivaxxers (back good old days MMR vaccines), one experts interviewed said something really stuck me: can’t allow vaccine debate become political, does, we’re fucked. Well guess what? It’s become political. Thanks reply. going try argue anything wrote since would repeating myself.  Whoosh talking ""Baby Boomers,"" boomer anyone old af get slang, like you. son minor, would call cps really giving horse pills. wish kid. allow kid even remotely near school right Kenya, health ministry testing around random thousand people every week. 40% general population around Nairobi testing positive back January. less 10% though. can't find website it, constantly reporting TV. comparison, around still twice likely die malaria Covid.  knew world full assholes holy Covid think they're lurking everywhere 😕 Got it. growing stories state (Ohio), recently saw one saying numbers increasing state (but still less 1% cases sequenced far). didn’t. I’m getting really tired sentiment got vaccine nation alcoholics. like drink rationale people right thing country likely best health decision us personally. educated nation also inherent part Irish people call bullshit there’s huge focus “sound”, vaguely translated fair, kind full oneself. It’s cultural sure way Irish stereotype would believe. can't gaslight virus  knowingly lying would agree you, politicians talking heads see easy way score points base, think large part people kind stuff mislead/brainwashed, easy see opposition stuff monsters enemy, fucked way think theyre helping, yes excuse ignorance day age much like religion, area everyone around including family hold certain set beliefs, chances go pretty low

without insane amounts misinformation bad actors, believe much population would strongly opposed masks/vaccines/social distancing hope reaching people need entirely write off, like live them

its fucked up, tragic, infuriating, get it, really do, painting easily influenced mislead light push beliefs Holy crap get vaccinated already. What? Nah :) lot people awfully psychopath-ish. Imo course. Sounds fun Mu borderline non-story point. fact becoming less less prevalent throughout world passing week, prevalent begin with. significant presence one country, Chile. Boomers born 1960s.. Shows accept know anything spend time actually reading learning things instead skimming the, 

I know might blow mind, people access expensive computers young.  know. took poster responded wrong way too. Oh well, goes online. Lots misinterpretation. interacting wild spreading disease everyone worse. Worked guy wouldnt believe COVID real thing. Even lockdowns stores closing, thought scam. asked would take actually consider real problem. answer: ""If saw people dying streets, maybe I'd believe then.""

I told sick head rather wear flimsy piece fabric, wanted people actually die hundreds convinced so. told him, way, less delusional terrorists serial killers. Like wont actively kill, wont actively help stop people dying. Maybe wrong way phrase it, still believe people morally psychologically dense. Sometimes thing change mind cold hard truths people dying everyday needlessly. Thank painting picture. need know. need able, point, honor experiences, sacrifices.  online classes suck. 

Source: I’m teacher. Hospitals New England fine, masks still required vaccinated kids. 

It’s idiotic point.  Delta infects 4 people every person gets it. Lambda infects 2. time, Delta got 1024 cases (4\*4\*4\*4\*4) Lambda got 32 time (2\*2\*2\*2\*2). would vaccination card expiration date it? knowledge, none vaccine cards family members thing there. boosters really big subject back Spring I'm sure person administered even made comment. 

Nevertheless, still ok go Mid-west. want to, wear N-95 mask extra precautions little fear unless immunocompromised. Drowning significantly common cause death covid America well. Yeah, look Japan S. Korea. Skinniest countries covid control That's boomer far everyone concerned lol mean matter reject anyway they're already death beds? late. states that, federal government. 10th amendment exists reason. Seriously that's terrible. What's harm letting someone vaccinated room. Care body. mind important too. Maybe nurse could hand iPad something? sure downvoted. Obesity one biggest indicators one hospitalized. 

Denmark exceptionally fit. Mississippi not.  Yup.. might considered gen x millenial depending end/start dates. 

But yah, friends playing nintendos, friends playing computers advanced careers - Infastructure / Cybersecurity / Application Developement / Database admins.

Again.. show know anything confident completely wrong. Fierce mild Spring?

And course vaccines.  10th amendment exists reason. Read Constitution. agree 100%! people really need reality shoved faces they'll accept it! People dying trolleys outside emergency departments Poland got Rule #1: Cardio mean ""ending pandemic""?

Pandemics end, one way another, one end point millions deaths. someone thinking possible eradicate virus vaccines alone, bloody hell check heads full hubris.

Eradication possible anymore March 2020. governments health authorities (including WHO) thank that.

Now need manage endemicity. Hopefully vaccines protect us worst countries expect see life expectancy reduced. back vaccine mandate get SNAP benefits unemployment checks? (I say sarcastically everyone knows dems would never dare soemthing would ACTUALLY improve public safety) understand consequences part freedoms.

Just like Libertarians, want complain government ""overreach"" still partaking benefits. Even worse live Federal funds mooching state. what's deal Mu variant? social media tends pessimistic orientation, I'm trying learn actual known risks variant without also falling catastrophizing it. I've seen Delta out-competed Mu far, reason think 'vaccine resistant' news coverage stating? so, what's stop surging alongside Delta? (I'm assuming, maybe wrongly, variant able bypass vaccine, would also able bypass natural immunity too.) That's total population. clearly specified comment percentage adults, parent commenter almost certainly talking adults well, since comparing Sweden Ireland's 90% adults number. It’s little different willfully reject free antidote poison you’re asking cared for. Also little different middle pandemic we’re faced hospital bed shortage.

Oh wait.  Coronavirus titles misleading. #1 can't get vaccinated laying deathbed. #2 ""Although number patients express regret received sought vaccination, even apologizing it""
I didnt see anywhere article claiming title says. Several,and takes minutes. 1200 hours sick time I'm going lose retire soon, might well take whole day off. “If pause service focus recruiting nurses vaccinated, able reengage delivering babies Lewis County,” Cayer told reporters.

Dumb question, thought fairly universally, ALREADY seeing nursing shortages across country. going recruit nurses from? 100% vaccinations, especially healthcare setting, purely economical perspective supply demand, seems may major problem.  vaccinated nurses command monetary premium? next months, going see interesting results whether companies actually stick guns don’t back policies. It’ll interesting can’t “focus recruiting” simply isn’t anyone recruit. stop delivering babies hospital perpetuity can’t fill demand? “Thanks reply. Go fuck self” Meh, American, think UK us beat music quality since 60’s.   parallels course, covid respiratory disease all. flu kill quite lot people every year (the last exception). think covid severe version flu. attacks entire body.

That’s extreme fear fight-flight response. cannot cope deny, anyone doesn’t agree threat.  that's huge increase. barely blip compared we've done past   Right?! like buy tests CVS Walgreens. 

Err... hold on. I'm told actually case. would wasting tests? that's 400k per day increase 1/3 easily handled since we've 2-4x current daily amounts recent memory fine Social media, Facebook regulations?

Not true. done safely. school district Chicagoland area person since January 2021 outbreaks school. Every identified case COVID student traced external source (family party, vacation, etc.)

It's understanding school districts mask mandates protocols fine. that's what, 4 million peak? something like way beat virus know much information possible, includes testing animals don’t think that’s why. think it’s it’s “time move on” children vaccinated. “Stupid humans”

probably every primate proven false much data straight fraudulent zero sympathy maternity nurses won’t get vaccinated protect vulnerable mothers babies. I’m sure quitting purpose believe irreplaceable show everyone.

Instead look like selfish people are. shouldn’t near newborn babies unvaccinated nurses. Stay away hospital eat horse paste. flu gave five month chest infection. Turns asthma trigger things. immune system bad, exact opposite. It’s high attacks back. flu kill people. he's advocating stoicism lol Likely, vaccinated better I’m talking one dose, since that’s indicative willing get vaccinated (the majority people get first dose also get second dose). got fucking annihilated almost entirety 2021 previous infection protective effective least short term.

My country's National Health Institute recently said according studies estimate 89% people could antibodies point.

We're seeing 1/10th deaths seeing daily months. probably downvoted people think lying. Ivermectin prescribed reputable doctors treatment covid anywhere world. prescribed things, like certain parasites river blindness, covid. We’ll probably get Linear B syllabary. variant “ja” “da” variant? every student Mississippi school system tested COVID last month? No?

So cited positivity rate flawed meaningless. Remember people represents you. guilty association. voted group Texas Taliban. Vote. isn’t space expiration date. think you’re confused something. ""Have it"" said.

It supposed happen like this, healthcare workers supposed quit continuously treat unvaccinated patients. Ok, so... source cite, none references Ivermectin, except one says ""not recommend except clinical trials."" None sources mention HIV, Dengue, West Nile, influenza... none coronoaviruses, whereas drug use forms coronavirus outbreaks past varied success.

Now, permit me:

Ivermectin used treat HIV-related scabies. Scabies parasites. Ivermectin used inhibitor DENV-2 Aedes albopictus, mosquito carries dengue. used treat bother looking two, assume wrong first two, wrong two well.

TL;DR - wrong. SUBMITTING life science Sorry, babies. entry world yet. honestly stay womb, endless storm shit here.  work companies 100+, don’t need get vaccinated. option get tested. employee would also violating OSHA. sure state’s unemployment policies doesn’t right employee collect unemployment intentionally violating OSHA requirements.  every student Mississippi school system tested COVID last month? No?

So cited positivity rate flawed meaningless. Yes, vaccinated safe, unvaccinated people source virus. Even get (1 10,000), likely mild illness. whole point vaccine proven among billions people effective. don’t get opening schools. One case shuts whole thing down. remaining 24% includes kids. Denmark counts vaccination percentage relation total population. someone unvaccinated point, many months get vaccinated, get covid go hospital, trouble lot sympathy them. made choice suffered consequences.  title makes seem like death bed COVID still get vaccinated. children. ""a people"" common sense. there's vaccine mandated way think Irish sub majority readers post goi g Americans already skewed view Ireland Irish-ness. 

On another note I’m delighted move successful. grew 80s Ireland much one flavour shadow England hand Catholic Church. Since I’ve seen society become increasingly diverse liberal I’m really happy far we’ve come even. thing cultural similarities Ireland Eastern European countries. don’t know is, maybe post-colonial thing either way, hope continue evolve society fair inclusive. last point wanted call vaccines pints thing don’t think it’s fair, even said jokingly. care work, bot going kill anyone take it.

Symptoms started Wednesday tickle throat slight cough. Thursday cough terrible rest kicked in. sure lot comments uneducated close minded. drug use forms coronavirus outbreaks past varied success.


as far drugs currently entering trial, *treatment* covd-19... two following similar paths currently available drugs (basically modified versions ivermectin).


everyone needs stop repeating ""facts"" social media ... learn recent history. least look data, realize possibility drugs make drug companies rich, might actually help actually good data fertility original trials.

""TL;DR: **Yes people phase 3 trial got pregnant vaccination. difference rates pregnancy vaccine placebo groups.** one vaccine group trouble pregnancy course study. also tested female rats find problems, either fertility pregnancy.

The Pfizer vaccine FDA report give nice summary like this, report 23 people became pregnant trial. report 2 adverse events related pregnancy, placebo group.

Both companies say continue monitor pregnant people. general, know reason vaccine would affect fertility. believe ever before. mRNA technology new-ish, radically different would reason believe fertility would affected. hand, growing evidence covid-19 affect fertility.""

And resources/ go fund spreading concern anti vaxxers suck resources. Yes vaccine. paywall hit  know healthy, young people go hospital get oxygen. may admitted ICU, still taking bed. want person takes bed someone everything right, got vaccinated, got car accident/had heart attack/etc there’s room treatment? Vaccines reduce risk hospitalized even greater young healthy idea body react virus, especially delta variant. Help community everything make sure don’t take bed someone else. It’s human decency. It’s never catching Covid, it’s burden healthcare system. even angrier unnecessary. need heroic people would get vaccinated.    Anti vaxx violence spreading throughout world. Perhaps grow educated, grow likely suffer Dunning-Kruger. 

It's frightening. I'm denying vaccine could superior naturally-acquired immunity; there's conflicting studies ongoing studies well, right unknown. sake argument, assume vaccines superior. question I'm asking is, **how much better natural immunity? difference justify vaccine mandate people?** important vaccine mandates consequences, need balance pros/cons. 


On related note, people fully vaccinated 1-2 months better protection vaxxed 7-8 months ago. latter forced get booster right away? not, justify this? know sure people waning vax protection better protection w/ natural immunity? 


(These thoughts, demanding give answer, related sources, I'd happy take look.) 


Stepping back looking bigger picture, measurable goal desired outcome mandate? achieve fully vaxxed rate X%? Depending X is, mandate might effective method achieving goal. key stop treating unvaxxed people homogenous group. mentioned previously, there's good portion unvaxxed people would get shot given opportunity honest conversations, X 70-80, seems establishing trust hesitant (not anti) population would safer move sweeping mandates.  


It always fascinated people turn conspiracy theories, truth is, (if all) longer trust authorities. Unfortunately, many pro-vax camp realize this, instead trying find reasons mistrust (some political case, see little hope; others, however, much poor messaging incompetent communication) addressing those, keep repeating statements made authorities calling people idiots believing them. Especially 16s vaccinated. Except vulnerable kids still expected go school unvaccinated, masks little ventilation. see decline cases? US two pandemics - one vaccinated one unvaccinated. unvaccinated still going strong.  Surprisingly live Washington State, governor taken virus seriously (we first documented case death regards virus). high vaccination rate, perhaps see need carrots entice people getting vaccine. however hold cash lottery, consider lottery financial incentive though, like say, lotteries taxes people understand statistics. would rather paid $10 getting shot chance winning $200,000.

Anyhow, see happens new mandate. like clause ensures paid time go get shot, think work favor since work graveyard. Dangerous fetus pregnant, though. something women taking without knowing sure pregnant. Exactly, there's many problems US simply propaganda Boston best example, I'll agree. Jan 6 caused leadership still know motivations Vegas shooter. 

Again, I'm saying worth freedom we've given up, I'm saying look whole picture. Check list never seen  disgusting NSW government country. hasn’t updated believe - remember around 400 even delta popped up.

States aren’t submitting Covid death /case data nearly much anymore. Certain states even so, many aren’t even really collecting ffs. won’t know many kids died delta this.

But know pediatric ICU’s never packed, delta certainly lower risk death kids, therefore stands children dying now, makes sense number moved 4 months.

TERRIBLE. got covid son. Hes teenager telling came from, believe came someone school. get annoyed people say vaccinated protected virus, choice mean you? Well yes protected virus. many things there. lose medical care unvaccinated people taking others time matters unvaccinated. Brett Weinstein said yesterday Rogan’s show wife pregnant joining train soon. it’s consolation it’s irrational response scared currently rare outcome. We’ve learned accept certain risks life (including flu itself, joke kids) lose sleep it. Obviously say shouldn’t take COVID seriously, absolutely must people getting vaccinated assholes. helps put things perspective stress levels. actually approaching 9/11 times 1000. it. Bad headache, sore throat low grade fever, fatigue, full body chills. sense taste gone, definitely diminished.

Can't say long last, though. Hey neighbor, I’ll bring beer camp spots! Also, breakthroughs office doesn’t mean doesn’t prevent spread looking macro level. look tiny population like office, can’t see it. need look large scale studies. I'm vaccinated covid. I'm sicker 15 years. Headache, full body chills, fatigue. I'm miserable still get cook care animals.

My son (17) got early case Covid. fever almost 105. completely delirious 48 hours. coughed weeks worst part, 18 months later still suffers dizziness palpitations. I'm sure ever fully recover.

The point: vaccine make completely immune. probably get covid point. Getting vaccine means likely mild case passes relatively quickly. boyfriend caught late last spring, could get vaccinated. stayed bed three full weeks. pulmonary fibrosis (meds cost $$$) crushing, relentless fatigue. really want risk that? Three weeks elephant chest, coughing lung, tossing fever. favor get shot. It’s choice refuse vaccine drastically lower chances getting covid Man happened Reddit Time root terrorists causing this. Also, Cantonese diaspora SARS burned memory since affected HK southern China. action plans ready go (my MIL stashed masks house didn’t even know there) imagine many people hospitalized drunk drivers people suffering emergencies, heart attack, can’t get care hospitals full. accent probably offers protection - good them. like give date. Would rather date say March vaccine widely available. dont care long hospitals willing give bed  No, know it. obviously understand evolution immunity work.  Let’s hope becomes abundantly clear fully-vaxxed countries back normal we’re suffering seventh wave zeta variant do, crazy guy overpass does. Vaccines make likelihood various effects (infection, symptoms, severe symptoms, hospitalization, death) less likely.

On micro level, chances severely impacted low take risk? vaccine free, even chance death low could lower. rolling dice literally dying, want best odds possible. 

On macro level, even small impacts individual massive impact society. Sure, one every 100 healthy adults end hospital, still lot people hospital. hospitals fill up, impacts heart attack victims, people car accidents, etc. Excess deaths rise significantly, even zero covid deaths. Further, transmission exponential. Dropping transmission rate 20% cut total number cases half couple weeks. protect children, elderly, people vaccinated breakthrough cases. Natural selection take course vaccinated still reduces personal risk death hospitalization, protects child infection, significantly less likely become infected able reduce viral load quickly thus, you’re contagious long unvaccinated.

We public health crisis, everyone part important part get vaccinated basically eliminate chance putting stain healthcare system that’s already crossed disaster.

Do part, beg you. child us unvaccinated children. It’s you. also young healthy, worried odds dying Covid, however quite worried risks hospitalization. According , odds hospitalization infected 2%, much higher previously thought - expecting something closer 0.5%. ran math estimate Covid likely put hospital everything else combined. According recent estimate, vaccination reduce odds hospitalization 80%-95% quite happy that. way see it, always going roll dice, might well roll better dice. both. Calm FDA willing accept vaccine protects 50% severe disease. got much better every metric. could 0% effective preventing infection still gotten approved.

They well aware hospitalizations would decrease dramatically vaccinated population. “Funny joke irish people drunks laugh” And, yet, “socialism denouncing” arses always first line “the handouts!”

The hypocrisy brain numbing astounding. What? lots american tourists non-coastal cities well. Paris, Vienna, Prague,..... places like Munich October Alps Winter. there's covid outbreak among tourists, there's also outbreak places tourists came (see even non-tourist areas issue. Despite vaccinations 60 percent whole population, already Covid patients Austrian ICUs time last year. France even ICU patients. need unvaccinated tourists countries even higher infection rates here. many reasons grieving families wouldn’t mention Covid positive obituary.

NPR [an interesting day. dunno. propaganda misinformation seems really easy look time. Possibly something 91% adults Scotland least one vaccine shot, knows. Maybe coincidence 🙄 Polio pandemic, one, polio still endemic places, two. covid vaccines are, point, effective preventing hospitalization death, latest studies showing eleven fold increase death risk unvaccinated. fact I'm even wondering mean ""efficiency"" considering I've never seen term used rating pharmaceutical before. Maybe meant efficacy, describes effective intervention is, case data speaks itself, since see vaccinated generally stay hospital vs unvaccinated pressing hospitals past capacity. You, friend, one spreading misinformation little clue research. People much educated experienced us say vaccine extremely effective preventing worst consequences COVID-19, far data showing correct current point time. human grade animal grade versions. animal grade often sold bulk farm supply stores people buying version since cannot get prescription (without paying $100 shoddy doctor outside health network zoom appointment). People take doses actual ""Horse Dewormer"" branded medicine without stepping dosage human body weight. taking roughly 5x dose amount leads overdosing poison control calls. similar pill ""Extra Strength"" Tylonol 500mg Acetaminophen recommends taking 6 pills/day. imagine 5x amount (15,000mg) would overdose starts roughly 10,000mg.

The issue proof actually works ""IN VITRO"" study said reduces Covid petri dish cells. dosage needed may kill cells may damage liver may actually interact properly spread around body enough make useful. Again, medicine applied directly cells vs orally taking dose. lot people clinging idea inside secret everyone know yet instead getting shot (as long immunocompromised) reduce severity Covid enough bad Delta case send hospital. people believe vaccinated shedding spike proteins affecting women’s periods. 

Those people critical thinkers. They’ll make shit worse truly believe first grader last week, Covid. lot viruses circulating right now, like every start school year. Chances different virus, Covid. smart considerate getting PCR test. Fingers crossed you! suspect covid denial horrible, horrible defense mechanism. Sometimes seems scarier image, stronger denial gets. Sometimes wonder it’s type mass hysteria?

I HATE people resorting ivermectin, time I’m like “well wouldn’t weren’t scared, maybe least outright denying covid’s existence?” obituary, DeMonia’s family urged people get vaccinated COVID-19. 

While hope convinces least local people get vaccinated keep mind he’s Cullman, Alabama; town Trump got booed recommending supporters get vaccine couple weeks ago. they’re Americans want “freedom” spread disease die.  amazing stark differences me. live BC Canada. half population Ohio. Friday, announced 820 new cases 9 deaths. shocked 9 deaths that's highest since February. Honestly, vaccine reduce risk getting infected transmitting 6 month old. reasons 1-10 get it. Ditto flu shot year well. videos actually work? Hundreds stories like failed convince people past. That’s people taking horse/livestock version drug. Many drugs used animals humans, taking animal dosage deserves mocked. Especially won’t take FDA approved vaccine. I'd imagine people fired political beliefs (however idiotic may may be) denied unemployment may little resentful. problem becomes problem leads political instability.

Whether happen remains seen. current political climate already fractious, I'd think twice adding logs fire. Literally everything said applies every developed nation. yet vaccine hesistency much lower outside US Well, Delta *helping* us reach herd immunity, hard way though. That's clear article. Covid affects heart cause heart attacks even symptoms mild. many reasons grieving families mention Covid positive obituary. bunch government officials health authorities lot answer let bloody SARS spread around World. forget point malice incompetence cannot distinguished.   Hey thank you. understand coming from. think difficult one. Vaccines good virus designed treat. Covid damn thing mutates therefore potential vaccines become ineffective. Additionally get Covid whether vaccinated tough choice honest. 

I must admit, struggle mask wearing, especially public transport find can’t breathe consistently. Let’s hope cure imminent. Yeah, increase hospital admissions staggeringly low considering number cases. know there’s lag two, it’s encouraging same.  Since vaccine came emergency authorization, fence getting vaccine. wanted wait finally approved, happened Pfizer vaccine. However, something happened made question getting it. 

To start, I'm 31 years old, healthy, exercise regularly, underlying health problems (no disease illness runs family either, I'm fortunate say family live well past 85-90 years old). 

I'm vaccination. fact, 6 month old got 3rd round vaccines. get tetanus boosters, TDAP, MMR vaccines, etc know get vaccinations protect against. get flu shot again, I'm healthy, like idea getting vaccine chance protecting season. 

Where work, 5 individuals fully vaccinated (mixture Moderna Pfizer) exposed COVID19 two employees also fully vaccinated went town conference diagnosed COVID. 

All 7 began showing symptoms 7 tested positive. roughly trace exposed when, conclude two employees day period transmitted vaccinated employees. 

So, honest question (in would appreciate honest answers)...what's point getting vaccine me? know there's argument ""well get it, chances going hospital COVID reduced"". But, chances going hospital covid reduced already given health status age. argument ""if get it, protect others"" seems null several vaccinated people spread vaccinated people work.

I still wear mask, I'm genuinely curious personally get vaccine. Thank advance serious responses. interesting. one logically extend that, people refuse get vaccinated get monoclonal antibody treatments (...) could responsible extending pandemic.

I think reasonable call person group persons responsible ""extending pandemic"". pandemic still raging around world, millions infected everyday sorts genetic make-ups, health conditions co-infected viruses. Taking sorts medicines, living unsanitary conditions close sorts animals. could appear next ""killing variant"". 

We still need monoclonal treatments, specially immunocompromised actually need equitable vaccine distribution. moral failure may cost us dearly. really easy understand point view. hard time parsing ""deserving care"" see anti-mask/vax crowd special needs. helps cope society hold position. RSV running rampant year too. majority unvaccinated probably never even left county much less travel abroad. would argue die covid.

I always use Katrina example prove point. Katrina kill thousands people itself. breakdown systems hurricane effected did. list casualty Katrina.

Covid broken systems like Katrina tho grander scheme. he's casualty covid. countries far generous labor laws US, police forbidden unionising, much military personnel, presents exceptional security risk. TL;DR: current vaccines still extremely effective (more 95 percent efficiency) hospitalization due Delta variant xase full vaccination. improve boosters certain groups tweaked vaccines. Drunk driving choice. One choose get Covid. equating diminish infectious rates freedom? Ridiculous. people mean say getting vaccine killing people That's true. Fevers deadly young children bodies chill compensate passed point return without signs.   would livid father beds taken anti-vax / anti-mask idiot got covid.

But covid, done world, much greater concern events 20 years ago. Americans put France list enemies invade anyway. Lol, bot. you’ve read things probably know doctor comes treating patients covid.

Honestly, wasn’t aware negative stigma around recently confused it’s become divisive.

Im taking hardline stance either miracle cure treatment; sharing experience.

Open reading studies share exactly get approach 70% vaccinated 80% vaccine efficacy infection. thought experiment yourself. Assume 100 people 75% vaccinated population 100 people 25% vaccinated population. exposed Covid. find 75% vaccinated population 25% infections among fully vaccinated. However group 1/2 total infections 25% group. 

Assume entire population vaccinated somehow exposed Covid. You’d 20 breakthrough infections 100% infections would among fully vaccinated. 25% vax group 5 breakthroughs 80 total infections.

If and/or injunction place, rule held months works way courts.

What Biden hoping courts grant injunction, which, since requirements effectively one time effort, would mean matter happens courts later on. However (at least personal opinion) courts tend favor status quo deciding injunction put place. ""normal"" position federal government mandate vaccines likely various courts allow move forward.

I get J&amp;J shot, sympathetic. Here's quote expert Michael Osterholm, [the Osterholm update, episode J&amp;J recipients, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. think really unfortunate data country support whether need booster dose. think point likely will. challenge getting information done based science opposed somebody like saying, think so. stay tuned. There's come. Nothing urgently needed anyone right now. think that's important message.

Essentially Janssen (J&amp;J) vaccine approved later, given smaller portion population. much data shots. margins error real-world studies efficiency bigger shots there's barely news coverage press regarding existence booster shots.

There [little needs foreign terrorists attack U.S. fellow citizens like these....

Disgusting. no.

its 3,000 day

thats one 9/11 per day

this 20th aniversary

\+...

back dec.

it almost 2 9/11s per day Police unions aren’t organized labor, they’re basically criminal organizations. Cops aren’t laborers, they’ve historically used repress actual laborers behalf employers. police unions ensure taxpayer dollars get pissed away keep bloodthirsty psychopaths free streets also armed. Well, literally speaking shitty friends. Anyway, data back up. 98% doctors vaccinated know vaccines work. Yet significant amount vaccine hesitancy among ""healthcare professionals"" (Nurses). It’s new anymore, it’s long past point it’s proven beyond shadow doubt. Try keep up. One Biontech founders said expect data 6 month - 5 year olds end year. probably coming sadly take bit longer. I’ve lots stuff injected, nearly everyone. It’s obvious it’s going hugely beneficial unless you’re complete moron blinded hate. nice guy worked 5 years died Rona. First close encounter anybody, knows anybody, knows anybody caught circle. Make pay health insurance. hospitals full go hospital Covid, send tent parking lot treated Ivermectin, thoughts prayers. Man, French lucky. wish country would that, them.  Well must surrounded hillbillies Bible thumpers. need approve vaccinations. don’t slightly-less-than-ideal risk-to-benefit ratio, go apeshit.   Again, think that’s pretty simplistic view things, especially knowing leadership time. don’t think sub conversation. Featuring extra pants-shitting time around. prevents getting sick. Preventions 100% effective 90% less likely get sick incredible. maybe reality animal version used often (against Covid) humans days USA. seems sold lot places. Easier get animal version?
The main question however be: help concerning (diminishing effects of) Covid not? seem case.
And yeah less mocking good. *Larger trials may needed something found conforms pre-existing views got Facebook. Well least problem fix time. husband's company following Microsoft's lead. 

He sad today. misses coworkers lunches.  deserve dogs. keep calling people ""know nothings"" spewing baseless information shows one knows nothing. vaccine ever fully mandated ever private lives areas. Yes go GOVERNMENT school need vaccines full mandate. attend schools get vaccines. government never stepped forced people get vaccine completely everyone matter so. WWII, antivax antimask people ones hanging Christmas lights Battle Britain Yeah. Yeah.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  Grandma still shitposting memes calling covid hoax posts much misses little girl. I've seen plenty low floor people unbelievable. Yes Wall Street vested interest commercial real estate industry ....and every Subreddit ever fully vaxxed. thought went without saying, comment future, present.  doubt that. seen many articles going start pandemic since vaccine.  petpeave. wife reading end January Reddit seeing numbers climb steadily china freaked us out.

This terrified me, point sleep night: 2 week incubation period asymptomatic infections.

That means days maybe weeks people get sick, ever get sick, spreading around.

We panic moment weeks ahead Americans. finally shut NYC, working home couple weeks asked boss citing virus boss. already stocked pantry bought deep freezer went living room point.

When lockdown happened, weeks later, palpable reaction neighbors (we live apartment building). around 6 o'clock getting packages downstairs everyone coming home city edge obviously freaked out. One lady came rushing elevator on, wide eyed, sweaty panicking. Nope. got elevator. looked oddly doors closed. idea deal nothing good ever comes hanging around people state. Besides, maybe fever?

One valuable lessons learned 9/11 unless experienced real threat emergency life, far less likely trust instincts take action immediately. People want cause scene, they're worried people think they're weird stand around moments, trying decide do. problem anymore. I'm ready turn around dime run even one else is. I’m millennial 30’s agree points benefits WfH

My older boomer colleagues also believe company forced back phone office 3 days/week long term. think jaded years seeing broken promises management careers That's part drives rabid denial... scared deep want be, see rest us clearly taking seriously makes damned hard stick heads sand. 


Instead rallying us help defeat Covid resent us making face fear. underlying study, linked article, data new cases hospitalizations week week.

tl;dr: vaccines good. edgy course see pattern, he's nitpicking Israels situation fit argument rather looking really easy say wrong vaccinated even vaccinated, would probably brought home anyway. reason count perpetrators. Interesting!! knew Chinatowns SF/Oakland largely Cantonese speakers, really think think distrust Chinese government made proactive early days pandemic. Republicans care facts man, egos also means e.g. weddings celebrations need stop time, pity imo. I'm slurring words Wow contradiction moms statements insane. still won’t get vaccine says, “More needs done people aren’t taking serious.” Like, what? tell you. go outside talk handyman late last week. asked wear mask property usually outside work, wearing mine.

 stores around require masks, lot people mask inside even required. Around here, maskless people get looks.

Crazy thing is, went Boston Monday (getting kiddo settled college). likely infected here, there, incubation period around 4-5 days. also means e.g. weddings celebrations need stop time, pity imo. It’s interesting anti androgens didn’t work, though one claims to, anti androgens market basically bring testosterone 0… isn’t wiggle room provide benefit. Unless off-target benefit? 

But knowing clinical trials, sounds completely unlikely.  vaccinated eligible populations. 25% Israel 12. That’s Delta got foothold. immediately reopened cast safety measures. reopened soon. See pattern? normally close much layer that? went Ireland 15 years ago surprised start closing 11PM. There’s lot cognitive dissonance that’s making crazy. one hand say you’re irresponsible plague spreader getting vaccinated. say vaccinated people spread disease much unvaccinated wear mask. Tres Modernas, totally understand people deeply skeptical messaging public health officials. can't find :( blows mind careless yet still hasn’t gotten it. Miami places get. They're refusing vaccine even every country administering them, easy see help really dangerous (specially compared covid itself). yet, taking fcking horse dewormers. Smfh. can't see logic there.  household fully vaccinated, visitors indoors one unvaccinated household.  fully vaccinated, meet indoors people one unvaccinated household risk severe illness 3 households there.  vaccinated people visit together indoors limit numbers.** also applies people positive COVID-19 test past 9 months. called vaccine bonus.

Biggest motivation right sounds like lame hell dreaming. New Zealand Australia part pandemic handled long time due quarantines, masks, etc etc etc...that 0 influence antimaskers/hoaxers/etc dose 5-11 fraction adult dose dose younger group fraction that. 

I heard numbers (on podcast think? Maybe “In Bubble,” Andy Slavitt)? Look numbers &amp; might give pause!! Please sure!

Like you, I’m also opposed “fudging” things makes common sense (I commented underage redditor find sympathetic adult help get vaccinated bc parents refused). though, wouldn’t willing take wild bet high dose 3 yr old.

This admittedly 100% anecdotal, acquaintance worried (5 &amp; 3 yo) falling ill bc younger sibling born heart defect &amp; spent much early life hospital, feeding tubes, etc. recently got infection period &amp; mildly symptomatic &amp; passed easily them. know worry long term consequences, etc, let’s hope kids fine.

Big hugs you! child still waiting &amp; it’s tough. I’m tired &amp; frustrated every damn day. isn't. pubs close 23:30. That's all. me, possible Mu could go vaccinated since Delta ravaging unvaccinated? reassurance, colds respiratory things going around too. son whole friend group missed school several days due symptoms, came back negative. cold virus hardier surfaces covid, hard catch school half heartedly wipe tables day. think need punishment losing child? Also prove parent passed beyond reasonable doubt?  dislike Leo Martin huge chunk government view politics change views science. Would willing screen cancer past scandals? barricading! still hoped would stay there. Israel ~63% fully vaccinated. pretty small majority, still tons unvaccinated. agree headlines suck. don’t disagree word that. think we’re seeing mask mandates classrooms offer protection outbreaks. Yesterday article PBS stating unvaxxed 11 times likely die covid. Someone shared [this commenting ""because they're less likely get first place."" ""doesn't really ton get though."" going say large portion 11 times likely ""s fact significantly less likely infected first place"" unvaxxed people 1.5 times likely go hospital 2 times likely die. 

This person heavily downvoted explanation downvoted rebuttal explain wrong/misinformed/misrepresenting data etc. 

I would like know downvoted much. wrong? misrepresenting data? misinformed? Yes. things reduced capacity, everything runs usual basically. 

Here’s reopening Education, propaganda. Although fair anti-vax movement people smarter groups people I’m question co-morbidities people succumbed Covid, especially they’re young, like somehow you’ve diabetic entire life die Covid 20s it’s perfectly fine. Yeah US lot work do.   Yes. However enforcement varies restaurant restaurant depending busy are.   story broke me. kids even hearing child suffering gets me. 

fuck ppl prolonging damn pandemic. limit propaganda? USA needs learn Thanks sharing, hope feel better soon.

That sounds lot like experience. Exactly, don’t think people realize getting flu really is. may get wicked sick truly flu sick. hope someday we’ll get point vax &amp; meds covid manageable regular flu, gotta careful.  Hear hear great period. 

However, day learned there’s like 5M people Ireland. It’s early math talk numbers, I’ll comment what’s mentioned here. Hospital utilization. Unvaxxed people clogging hospital system making folks need care able access needing wait much longer access resulting poorer outcomes. virus spread weaker, vaccinated. kid get like 10 billion viral particles, would get much less. everything dose level. Google good y'all may live virus, full garbage belong human body. I'm curious since want get annual flu shot already couple years. risk trigger GBS? apply also subunit protein based ones Novavax (I know others exist)? Social media ability rewire people think emotionally respond situations. large part we're mess begin with. person probably convinced going happen them, did, *that* bad.

One window opportunity break mindset show real consequences virus, usually something close home. work everyone, some. Portugal Ireland compared lot great job. someone else's responsibility protect things.  don’t want read article:

They reported 5 local cases today, family. student possibly spreading covid around days. Heading direction, restrictions vaccinated end October. Me! Fully vaccinated since early May pretty much living life normal since then. 

It started scratchy throat cough. chalked long LDW realized getting worse. Woke third day boyfriend urgent care test couldn’t taste breakfast. time got back, declined bit experiencing body aches chills. 

Third night far worst. Couldn’t sleep 30 minutes time, fever, coughing, etc. Woke fourth day kind feeling better quickly went hill. Experienced minor loss taste smell honestly think it’s related congestion creepy Covid anosmia. 

It’s fifth day decent nights rest longer feverish achy. Still congestion coughing much better before, would say it’s comparable standard cold. 

Sorry novel— oddly cathartic. Like men would miss chance indoor pints, Summer rain horizon. 
Outside dining drinking isn’t fun gale force winds annihilating tables patrons. miss ;) Kinda hard track public restrictions lockdowns varying countries Ireland relaxing lockdowns restrictions come end October. Even Ireland's hospital admissions ICU numbers continuing drop lowest across Europe. type this: 311 hospital (down 17) 59 ICU (down 1). Cases also falling current trend past week.  


Source: RTÉ News double standard.

That fact I've watched government steal lie entire lifetime. everyone suffering, especially financially, gave pay bonuses nothing.

If want trying force something, I'm asking getting it. Varadkar vacinated. excuse **is** vacinated. fuck kind nonsense logic operating on.

Frankly seems like desperate reason it. top that, really young, chance get vaxxed months now, controversy happened week ago.    No, recent studies show vaccinated people around 1% chance getting infected covid *over 3 months*. exception healthcare workers, exposed virus significantly higher rates higher incidence breakthroughs compared demographics (yet it’s still rare healthcare workers.) unvaccinated people far likely spread Israel’s rates high comparatively. pretty much need 100% vax rate prevent hospitals run. think rabid trump supporting antivaxxers, literally nothing convince them. They’re beyond saving. people fence? POC understandable distrust medical trials, etc? Seeing hearing may sway them. life mostly back normal what?

thanks think it’s … well won’t happen kind thing . Like people social safety net minds can’t imagine ever needing . It’s thing cope possibly , convincing special one bad stuff could never happen ….  hearing ambulances street ny shut home made break crying begging god mercy healthcare workers jobs. 

it angers see ppl drag pandemic. It’s definitely useful killing intestinal roundworms. 

And completely useless killing covid, similar cow urine particular purpose.

In mind, ridiculous thing would celebrate crap worked.

But doesn’t.

And neither cow urine.

To fair… cow urine probably safer consume unregulated doses. hell would Leo influence decision get vaccinated? Yea man.  People dumb things ivermectin nonsense needs go away.  sick death hearing 24/7. It’s overblown nonsense 

The world gone nuts left right point it’s disgusting  mom ““I one people anti, it,” said. “Now, wish never was.”

The kid paid price parents self-centeredness. Let ignorant ICU live streams.  Jup, right. edited top post :) 


But course always nicer post causes people research bit get know things sources, time (in case) learning emerald isle.  Next time anti vax ralley play loud possible.  need approve vaccines children soon might 2020 again. without using short cuts. hope people smart enough know difference

All write ""pub/event curfew"". matter smart person is, know anything situation Ireland going suddenly figure actually I'm quoting Irish media

You weren't. article linked said ""pub curfew"". specify first. don’t admit unvaccinated (by choice) hospitals. 

While we’re it, maybe insurance companies drop too, premiums don’t go stupidity (an American problem US). least wedding attended last week completely stopped 11:30, would've loved continue dancing even without bar, measures quoted reason stopping party entirely. Let's hope good news topic allows also last measures go soon. randomly get middle night take temperature otherwise healthy child?

Because sure don’t unless know they’re sick already. 

Which suspect happened here. Mom trying cover ass seeking medical care late. Humans paying drug bought livestock level dosages instead getting free vaccine funny. father law sent Tik tok West Virginia governor saying %25 percent cases vaccinated. keeps trying tell vaccinated ones getting everyone sick unvaxxed ones protected 17 years immunity. That’s son Covid 3rd time year. Shame. they’re giving horse pills. Even bigger shame.  It’s difficult figure dose honesty, taking Tylenol, ibuprofen plenty supplements people take plenty freaking dangerous.  It’s dumb political issue I’m sick reading Reddit daily. 

Should people get vaccinated instead taking ivermectin, yes.  100 percent. like taking zinc vitamin c won’t stop Covid.  Either it. Completely agree. 9/11 basically one-off lucky criminal event. massive one, indeed, ""war."" embarrassing response gave power deserved. treated like crime; find responsible bring justice. first responders anti vaccines. I’ve advocate vaccine department although even close 100% ..many gotten vaccine. Meanwhile, South Carolina, kids’ high school 52 positives 840ish since August 17. suck Governor Foghorn Leghorn. read book years ago autobiography woman lived flu pandemic 1918, point book one historical events happened lifetime.

Anyways, couple children point, oldest daughter around 9-10 years old think? one house sick, everything totally normal. daughter didn’t come breakfast morning like usually did. Mom raced stairs found little girl dead bed, already cold. always stuck I’ve terrified one kids randomly dying flu ever since. youngest daughter turned 10 fucking relieved get vaccine. first bucko. extra medical bills help purse peace mind. think it’s good thing already-vulnerable population going legitimate reason think government get them? 🤔  claim willing members control group. Dying give world data important get vaccinated.  Yes I'm speed limits. able drive 120 school zone naked public GOD GIVEN RIGHT GOVERNMENT CAN'T FORCE Oh that's relief sure! add this, random jumps Ireland's data especially seen deaths mostly like due inconsistent data cyber attack HSE (Health Executive Ireland) giving derps precious hospital beds? 04:30? Maybe 03:30 time everyone gets out, dancing usually finished 3.  think point. Flu joke don’t live fear it. get vaccinated protect kids, don’t lie awake night worrying kids dying flu (or us don’t anyway). Kids likely die car crash, don’t generally avoid taking places. today, people won’t wear mask, proven save lives, they’ve embraced first attitude.

I think less different think. People group tribes, work hard help people tribe well show affinity tribe. Sometimes mean firefighters marching endless stairs rescue people. Sometimes means utterly illogical adherence symbols belonging tribe refusing masks, vaccines, etc. feel saying people selfish obscures mask refusal made shibboleth tribe. people selfish - would gladly help others - scientists public health officials made enemies tribe. Again, that’s fine that’s think right choice, least honest acknowledge fact pretty ugly consequences. US?  expensive live (outside rent) major world cities. 

Public transport alright. great anywhere outside Dublin. 

Other that, pretty damn great. Pls pay ppl mind. Everyone Ireland hates seems premature agree. many aren’t. percentage adults, goes Portugal, France, Ireland Iceland. Profit always prevails   first. literally broke five million couple days ago. Expecting add another next twenty years.  comes OSHA mechanisms. Potentially fired would put pressure get vaccinated, may even effective Push jab!!! Ohhh, 4 year olds can’t get jab! let’s blame mother….😂😂😂😂 breastfeeding? so, getting antibodies. know fifty people got it. Five - zero. 50. Many long covid, couple passed away. perception disease insignificant invalidate experience, raw data globally? That’s lot Good news !

Meanwhile Portugal almost 80% total population fully vaccinated, almost 87% least one shot.

That's like 98% eligible population ( 12 yo) wife nurse ICU says people get talking. Time regret long ago. Hey that's I'm from! Well UK achieved pretty comparable rate.  bhriste honrstly seems risky giving vaccination prevent infection

Not saying total lockdown tenable long-term, also hot girl summer x Delta bad move I'd say common sense education. gotten middle night brain finally processed odd behavior kid day potentially coming something.

Twice nothing, hot enough took temp ear, woke take accurately administer motrin.

But kiddo got sick much, going bad, behavior would start change hours showed symptoms. proportionally resources throw TIL people use emotions risk assessment opposed also using rationality  yet Sweden simply didn’t take elderly hospital. Pre-triage. Haha 😂 Seems smart..... /s ""It's old sick people"" said 70yo cousin MS. spent 3mos ICU summer catching Covid. hospital let wife daughters visit get vaccine.  Yeah, American ICUs wouldn’t nearly overloaded took Sweden’s approach heroic measures.    Maybe one breaks through. That’s viral content really works restrained jubilation people promising therapeutic may work gross emblematic junk-food politics poisoned public health responses Covid. Go high-five eachother somewhere else. Powerful video. Glad made it. nurses turned hospice care workers unvaccinated. sound give us PTSD. cleaning dead body, saying sorry patients families, zipping body up. Oftentimes, even time process wtf going break right shift ends tired pass out, begin think saw hits once. vaccine leaky spread mutate. need zoom Google places breakthrough cases. Yay die that's benefit. dying effect vaxed still get long covid get hospitalized happening vaccine rates go left kids unvaxxed denied rights anything go anywhere science catches up? people legit can't get vaccine? supposed punished weak? know unvaxxed get virus survive get immunity too? know get long covid symptoms vax? know long term effects boosters even Vax itself? know protect vaccine resistant strains since everyone gonna vaxxed yet vaccine giving sterilizing immunity. know never one successfu sterilizing treatment vaccine coronavirus mutated natural state? know drinking decreases immunity even Vax? I'm sure questions could ever answer hey let's lazy non thinking comes greatest threat health yet human rights grab history. Time tell story. Let's hope u booster 22 tell story. think found text trip destination  God damn. Gotta love Irish fun fact: South, teachers aren’t allowed unionize, strike lose pension and/or teaching credentials! America extreme individualism people live insulated isolated lives. majority people commute cars go home single family homes. don’t public squares citizens mingle socialize like countries, everywhere private property. Add advertising, branding marketing that’s faces decades susceptible open disinformation campaigns. Also long history us v them, ‘rebels’, tribalism. America pretty unique among developed countries. Science form responsible identifying best ways prevent spread (masks, vaccine delta due present antibodies) minimize health damage infected (vaccine, various strategies hospitals (especially ICU, etc)) delivered; *physical medical science* done job (and continue basically *more* share job hence overwhelmed hospitals, burning doctors nurses, oxygen shortages, etc etc).

Political science social science (specifically psychology) gains need made. Resistance masks, social distancing, vaccines, suggestions physical sciences, fact driven policy, etc etc quite literally killing people. significant disconnect population sane choices medical context, *someone institution something* going make gains people going continue die. Stop taking Israel’s situation context lazy actually write arguments. Israel lot people eligible age get vaccinated- 78% eligible fully vaccinated, it’s 58% total population. well reopened Delta variant reached spread quickly. Vaccinations helped people catch covid milder case. seriously ill vaccination mostly 60 years old underlying health conditions. Vaccinations help. Even get covid after, you’re less likely hospitalized even less likely die. 

Look rates hospitalized dying USA right now- it’s unvaccinated people, huge margin; they’re likely catch it, 10 times likely hospitalized, 11 15 times likely die. 

Vaccinated people help stop slow spread. Slowing stopping spread means hospitals don’t get overwhelmed people don’t die waiting ICU beds unrelated treatable illnesses. everyone else spreading little ‘why when’ arguments helping continue pandemic. 

Sources: Biden said vax mandate weekly testing affect 80 million workers right?

Let’s say 4% refuse get vaccinated opt testing (which conservative estimate). That’s 3.2 million tests week. Fair enough. 

 simply think role hospital save people matter what. sort argumentation beforehand, worthy saving, seems wrong me. 

 Regarding consequences course I'm that. be. However comes medical treatment. Many countries seems share view. 

 real life example top head would american doctors Afghanistan giving medical treatment wounded enemy soldiers. Goes Geneva Convention believe. Interesting. everybody wear masks still? think reached herd immunity (via natural infection vaccination)? Portuguese, great bunch lads! I’m grandma, age wise could easily be, first job programmer. Pfizer. day third shot rough, lasted day. much better getting Covid!  They're counting least one dose, two. mRNA vaccines even one dose pretty good preventing death severe disease. everyone got least one dose would happy. operative word _precious_ hospital beds. health care systems designed accommodate certain rate mishaps shenanigans. Intentionally disregarding safety measures pathogen spreads exponentially fall category.

As Canadian, I've slowly come advocate maybe universal health care right, social contract. opt choose social interests. insurance thing easy done iirc. 1st one much easier considering ER, treat emergency typically; people wait several hours broken toe. person covid o2 sat unstable without o2 therapy, likely get bed put high flow nasal cannula, nonrebreather, bipap, eventually keep remaining unstable get worse, intubated.

People try make sound like intubate every covid patient ends killing anti vaxers think something wrong blindly following protocol. Intubation covid patients try keep dying patient alive little longer  Also, pictures screen like Hollywood drama. It’s like difference watching car accident news movie vs first responder. Obviously isn’t argument would make people. fun dumb high horse. ""Exaggeration facts""  entire problem COVID start. actually entire problem media people worship tit. 

So, turns, agree something. fair, much America doesn’t think virus exists. they’re sure Denmark real thing, either. can't control actions moment. know grateful liver recipient go rabbit hole alcoholism, medicine blind. Fix people first judge second 200 9/11's still counting 1 every 2 days. Congratulations antimask, antivax patriots. sure you’re spitball-diagnosing guy’s immunoresponse link clearly states recovered + vaccinated actually offers strongest protection reinfection. 

The dude climbed gate leopard exhibit refused follow simple CDC/WHO guidelines.

From researchers also found people SARS-CoV-2 previously received one dose Pfizer-BioNTech messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine highly protected reinfection virus still unvaccinated. say Holy Bible vaccines Acellular pertussis, Diphtheria, Haemophilus influenzae, Hepatitus A, Hepatitis B, Human papillomavirus, Influenza, Measles, Meningococcus B, Mumps, Pneumococcus, Poliovirus, Rotavirus, Rubella, Tetanus without sin? That’s pretty powerful. one old enough vaccinated (and wasnt) literally one week away getting vaccine 12th birthday. Nope.. boomer. 

You can't get win here. Irish please hate country Thanks positive comment, rare see people talk Portugal... let alone positive way!

I wrote earlier comment following Portuguese tradition shitting Portugal maybe slightly excessively - got removed stepping fourth rule bit much (oops!).

We fair share problems, we've done (surprisingly, told Portuguese people's reactions elsewhere here) well this. 🙂 country also obviously great tourists, important country... kind hides issues them, goes bit everywhere, really.

Wherever are, hope stuff gets better country, we've got this! 💪😤💪  guess gets question, immune escape. actually able get around vaccine / antibodies, really competing Delta, right? presumably could infect many people already Delta and/or vaccine. outcompeted Delta, must least somewhat susceptible antibodies. right? Scroll up, they’ve already judged. I’m upvoted you’re downvoted. think scrolling agree everyone agrees me? Take delusion elsewhere. Jesus first vaccine. died may live. vaccinated us hell. accept body, like vaccine. Yes, get ""disenrolled"", allowed class, dining halls, anywhere campus swipe, etc. period time leave dorms etc. someone absolutely refused leave might call cops whatever guess. Stop taking away icu beds real. They'll gladly room doesnt really understand technology able use own. I'm guessing theres many unvaccinated people around lie entrance screening letting people in. rural hospital extra careful since dont tons excess rooms Covid cases skyrocketing.

Theres huge wedding town tonight everyone family going maybe good thing we're allowed hospital bit case wedding ends superspreader. I'm going either case though. idiots don’t understand things. Pure curiosity speculation likely since whole world fully vaccinated within year Covid mutations likely cause breakthrough cases creating never ending cycle?  Hospitals already triage patients. limited resources. limited beds limited healthcare workers chances survival antivax covid patient much lower vaxxed person serious infection pick? think it’s first come first serve? You’re idiot. 

Healthcare human right. money, insurance, resources, healthcare. people money get better healthcare then? It’s right isn’t it? don’t access doctors? It’s right isn’t it. You’re naive. ambulance run pro-covid crowds over. ems shit do, people save. dont time shit Yes think happening. I'm DC metro area pretty much restrictions removed Memorial Day never really problem. surge cases recently probably schools, lot illness hospitalization death. Vaccination levels high suburban area people easily isolate work home. parts country similar similar reasons. mean basically us months, nervously watching current wave already subsiding.

The media course never report good news like keep looking find areas problem report that. lot areas fine. do. standardized test scores low kids online classes. think person gonna make scores better. Something funding test scores.  Start clinic unemployed healthcare workers help fellow freedom seekers. Absolutely horrifying. med staff delivering babies won’t get vaccine? ... dense ... lol  good study see someone illness similar Guillain-Barre. doctor considers contraindicated study like done Transverse Myelitis without MS present. Really hoping see one done soon. mean flu give pnumonia dose totaly fuck lungs up, flu dose lots symptoms, covid basicaly flu, except every symptom worse, dose dammage, far likely kill you.

a lot works flu spreading, works covid. works covid helps prevent flu viruses spreading. Since social distancing havent colds, havent flu, really even got sick long time single j&amp;j? haven’t allowed second, yet.  word funny also taken mean ""interesting"", obviously context OP using. one lacks comprehension skills you. Yep, saw someone post wish America could united like 9/11. person anti mask, anti vaxx, etc. person chance united failed. Sorry thing, covid vaccines ""expire"". noted:

According [Mississippi Department State Mississippi total 2020-2021 student population 442,627. Taking 18,825 number students tested positive month (provided calculate case-positivity rate 4.25% \[= 18,825/442,627\].

This would considered according CNN Medical Analyst Dr. Leana Wen discussing CDC's system measuring community transmission COVID-19.

*Note: attempted find data student testing Mississippi, could find anything. anyone find information, happy update calculation case-positivity. said, would accurate data.* pandemic ends Delta becomes endemic pandemic over. nonsensical statement, least response headline. head at. entire age group acting reservoir, coupled mildness majority cases, I’m sure getting shot dampen transmission everyone quite bit. 

Not mention, tried getting close 12’s? Mine started kindergarten I’m realizing futile keeping away 3 year old brother is. symptoms could easily asymptomatic. play together lot constantly others faces, drinking others cups, spitting bath water others faces matter much try stop them. thought Trinity College highly regarded?

The media, social media, loves idea new variant deadly also resistant vaccines plays doomsday armageddon fantasies. make real. Finally LatAm catches break (thanks high vaccine uptake)! figure why. /s 

Science math important.  school district testing, require test, contact tracing... great. voluntary basis... great job. Irishman here. Stop speaking us. US federal government can't really everyone. States could theoretically require citizens course would (i.e. Florida). State local governments make decisions, school districts companies. simple someone simply deciding federal level. true masks also patchwork. vaccinated big cats zoos. vaccinate dogs? We've got many shots laying around. Truth stranger fiction.  N.Y. — upstate New York hospital said pause delivery babies two weeks spate resignations maternity unit workers objecting COVID-19 vaccination County General Hospital, Lowville, temporarily stop delivering babies Sept. 24, WWNY reported. news conference Friday afternoon, Lewis County Health System CEO Gerald Cayer said seven 30 hospital workers resigned hospital’s maternity ward. added another seven maternity unit staffers undecided getting vaccine, television station workers objecting Sept. 27 deadline receive first dose COVID-19 vaccine, Watertown Daily Times reported.

Would love hear countries like Portugal vaccinations high. Want see light end tunnel. US? seriously doubt it.

First, would dubious legality, second, probably needed. current mandates probably get us another 10% vaccination among adults, vaccine approval kids another 50-60% kids vaccinated.

It's probably somebody wants create fear current mandates :) Ivermectin

I notice ""flu"" catch-all term general contagious illness some. Like mom calls cold stomach bug flu ""stomach flu."" think desensitizing. realized I've never actually influenza, colds 24-hour viruses. care? feel kids, adults. I'm saying thing you: many young people taking seriously. I'm worried get people make exaggerated arguments. Saying COVID poses risk one, individual young person probably get general (though always), true. truth indirect (young people serve reservoirs infection mutation lead deaths primarily older people, though younger people too). 

I've heard people go far implying COVID deadly young people holes argument, people use cover hesitancy. completely agree except didn’t hear messaging first anti-vaxxers. CDC NIAID directors hyped concept anyone else! believe exaggerated cherry picked talking points studies order get vaccinated people start masking order peer pressure unvaccinated people too. little manipulation backfired horribly threw gasoline anti-vax fire. That’s conspiracy theory…but medical experts like Monica Gandhi saying essentially too, it’s crazy theory: Canada currently 78% eligible fully vaccinated 68% population vaccinated. 

While good, higher. Come Canada!!! Get vaccinated [NYT days ago.

These stats reinforced numbers released CDC, Israel, certain states Oklahoma Virginia, etc. track breakthrough infections. Here's  gonna become like flu. Eventually everyones gonna get infected get covid shot every year. American, guidelines seem awfully familiar...  That's said early pandemic people could barely get test wasting tests lions tigers crap even people's pets that's wrong levels.   found older article business insider.

I'm still looking it, supposedly variant could needs emphasized more.  

With masking, weekly testing, high rate vaccinations teachers (required) eligible student body (required athletics clubs) we’ve seen spread local high school despite cases brought outside. summer day camp similar results lot fewer kids eligible vaccinations. 

It’s still early going, we’re feeling hopeful while. guy do? Spit bananas? smh.

No way transmitted way (: wasting tests gorillas? what's US State Department's travel advisory?  

 trip tentatively booked October, F knows what's what? hope planet ceases exist.  Ok suggestion? reason trial’s etc use randomized samples double blind testing. portion population difficult area get to? young people there? area already hammered first wave, etc. way conduct experiment right controls otherwise it’s pretty close worthless. Congratulations, many countries probably never get includingy country :( ruining even achievement.  people would rather die admit they’re wrong. issue limited resources hospital beds. addiction avoiding vaccines. health condition makes anti-vaccine. People foregoing simple solution significant damage people seeking emergency healthcare reasons significant damage health care system general. Yes, work healthcare yes, know many people left field entirely due immense stress pandemic caused. Many anti-vaxxers incredibly rude even violent families act even loved one dying quarantine. something doesn’t give, we’ll likely staffing shortages hospitals years even decades come. means longer waits seen emergency rooms, longer waits seen specialists turn, significant extensive recovery programs potentially larger number people dying waiting seen. Ideally, one would ever suffer needlessly. that. suffer suffering cannot avoided? innocent one whose lackadaisical decision consequence warned about?  young generally attitude. healthy really never worried getting sick virus. also worry serious side effects vaccine.

But inadvertently get virus pass someone else enough reason get vaccine. plenty people at-risk population life, in-laws, co-workers, neighbors, etc. 

Also chance virus become deadly I'd rather additional protection case. already 10-12 vaccinations another?

And emerging job legal reasons get it, may required employer, want able vaccine card certain events, international travel, etc. mom took took social security earliest opportunity, even though cost income long run.

Again, think know don’t. something makes sense doesn’t mean everybody world thinks like do, every American since want get arbitrary.

Sept. 11th tributes feel hollow

I watched bit remembrance ceremonies news, turn off. couldn’t stand watching it. I’m seeing posts social media, can’t stomach it. 

I’m saying 3,000 lives lost weren’t important shouldn’t remember (we remember…they important), many people dying *every 2 fkn days* US covid — 99% deaths preventable— one seems care. Huge swaths American society basic public health care measures would SAVE AMERICAN LIVES. 

Are American lives lost valuable taken evil foreign enemy gruesome televised terror attack, less dying quietly thousands hospitals? Today, seems like that, I’m *disgusted* Adult..... lol, like dear leader, snow flake man child. I'm jealous. best analogy considering know (and know) current vaccines. think making statements little irresponsible without accounting things like waning efficacy time, compromised efficacy vs delta, similar viral load among vaxed unvaxed, probability experiencing adverse effects, discrepancies availability among populations, potential mutation emergence new strains etc.

Imo better analogy would driving old car vs driving new model whose safety profile deteriorates within months purchase. wear seatbelt (mask), practice mindful driving (social distance) regularly service vehicle (boosters), still putting others risk.  news? makes feel better, keeping close eye stats related underage covid deaths, exceedingly rare, even delta. Last checked couple weeks ago around 400 deaths 17 younger 6.8 million covid cases. anyone seen article study suggesting myocarditis greater risk teen males vaccination hospitalization COVID? 

I read article yesterday said study peer reviewed yet, cannot find article. thought Reddit. Im afraid people ask Monday. also suspect hell - almost certainly symptoms days sad. 

My kid seizures fever age, fucking scary. important treat fever immediately keep medicine stopped. covid back then, fevers children serious. Perhaps much little body. sure explanation. Exposure provides least immunity, much debatable. every time wave sweeps area leaves behind illness immunity. Combine vaccinations almost surely point end road widespread outbreaks waves. read article ""the atlantic"" title ""coronavirus forever""

Even technically true hate media using headlines like sow panic gain views this.

Also see medical experts pushing idea ""we never back normal again"" stuff like this. Maybe like centre attention. Yes, true Covid present way suspect chest pain cardiac issues.We many patients come medical problems incidentally test positive Covid.Some asymptomatic Covid course, must isolate them. “Dude don’t understand. never get sick.” one close friends tells me.  means two doses Pfizer Moderna, one dose J&amp;J.  
Have asleep while?

Covid contagious chicken pox, would dumb assume illness Covid. terms infectiousness, nothing else circulation even comes close. might want check Kant's definition freedom ability govern one's actions basis reason, desire.


""Reason"" operative word, words ""think act"".


Edit: realised might clear: opposition ""freedom"" ie ""I whatever want"". spoke two nurses yesterday anti vaccine total cultists. sure vaccine deadlier virus, rely dewormer, doctors pretending vaccine working government threatened taking licenses, almost people dying covid vaccinated.

 I'm terrified democracy. True - slur. comment makes absolutely sense. hitting black people; white America would even greater problem forced vaccinations mind would reason vaccinate.  Really granny???? would assume mother knows better. Yea recently given ivermectin Thailand two different parasites.  Ivermectin also given Africa prevent river blindness another parasite.  Ivermectin isn’t dangerous drug like drugs side effects documented use cases.  

Like wouldn’t take aspirin acid reflux.  Anyways think shit blown proportion people fight. people want eat horse medicine hey that’s body deal consequences.  evidence antibodies passed mom baby utero via breastfeeding sonata least protects available newborns either / or. 

I article links hand, unfortunately, logically follows given practice getting TDaP vaccine 3rd trimester protect kiddo pertussis. thoughts exactly. like you’re both! 

I’m talking Americans didn’t suggest things, made factual statement based available data. guess make know-it-all. wear badge pride!   EU reached 70% fully vaccinated along population (all ages)

Not correct, EU whole 70% people 18+ 60% total population. anyone ELI5 one would ""crowd out"" other? I'm assuming can't time. that? God that's fucking sad. saying appreciate lucky orviliaged here, also mean can't critical countries short comings well though. I'm really happy easy access vaccinations decent percentages vaccinations states, still can't stand big anti vax movement getting all. Definitely could worse, would also much better. There's also straight shortage primary care doctors. one, husband doesn't. looked, many already many patients can. remembers certain people said COVID affects older people, COVID “totally“ control would gone Easter 2020. remembers good old days? Negligent Homicide. Meningococcal take child like unheard disease progress quickly. us saw empty city streets heard almost nothing ambulance sirens weeks. 

Thing lot people never saw that. read conflicting info Facebook friends end thinking it’s hoax. handouts people color. ""welfare babies"" people color. unemployment white people it. Population 12+ Probably made reservation immediately drove 3 hours expecting wait 1 hour shot able vaccinate person got since almost one there. not? pretty good don’t think avoiding disclosure prevent investigation involving child dying home. You’re familiar DNRs right? People already right refuse medical treatment. They’re refusing vaccine preventive measure. cases it’s grandad heart attack, Jim refused vaccine one treated immediately choose? never said would automatically never treated, said “could refused”. willfully put danger, lower priority. That’s I’m saying.  sure! happen find repulsive people cheer marginalization already marginalized folks Even better seatbelt affects you. bullshit arguments applied that. however completely different.    1/3 pop accounting 2/3 cases almost 3/4 hospitalizations. Still effective. thought trend improving first realized dates go backwards text goes Wow it’s sad. really need go sources misinformation like it’s capital offense seem abnormally high. still means 72% hospital unvaccinated. Let's real here.   ICUs get overrun choice lock down.

I agree! current hospitalization rates among vaccinated population small overrun ICUs. currently talks another Ontario thing gov super pro lockdown.

Not really. Ontario, moreso jurisdictions, incredibly slow resistant implementing lockdowns. hesitancy necessitated longer lockdowns they've tendency letting things get control anything it. accurate wouldn’t let us either. ones refuse vaccinate probably won’t good representation us brain cells already looked like idiots now.    when? Fauci saying might see approval October.  yeah think probably best argument prevent people freaking this. force kids hoe hypocritical would ourselves. wonder vaccines 27.7% received. Anywhere find data? called getting laid people would consider fired. Look don’t want rude forgive I’m way base I’ve become sensitive bot bullshit bio textbook. two year old account 2 comments posted 281 days ago sudden series comments ivermectin. research pretty overwhelming nothing placebo. would even question physician prescribing point. words, I’m calling bullshit, heavily.  yeah pay (which agree with) really equivalent option. liberals things typically greatwr good precedent would allow someone nefarious reasonings take advantage. Disgusting.

Vaccines widely available well 3 months now. vulnerable children home. god ""needed another angel"" would kept instead sending shit parents would die painfully needlessly young life. literally need bunch different vaccines public schools first place That’s actually decline previous week; 75% districts reporting week. guess that’s silver lining.  Meanwhile, Lafayette:

ಠ_ಠ  sister got first vaccine expecting go France. delta, went smoke, getting second. 3.2% people breakthrough cases *and test positive* end hospital, according CDC report August. Yeah, breakthrough cases happen. see population higher vaccination rates. fully vaccinated people suffer symptoms mild symptoms.

Where see severe hospitalizations ICU fully-vaccinated tends much older persons, significant comorbidities. watched interview day physician working COVID ICU basically said fully vaccinated patients ones really lack ability fight \*anything\* anymore (very old, etc). That's places third doses going nursing homes, immunocompromised people, etc.

Of course, would discoverable looking around little instead making sure put clickbait formatting title. someone industry (mostly research use), yeah, biotech growing even pre-pandemic. Oh jeez no, not. Attempting turn back caused bunch rogue programs break standard operating procedures. appear base code running wild making fun programs they're supposed meant threat, gun. 

However, watch happens take away peoples livelihoods. people jabyden shitting ones guns.  

I think hold up, going pretty may actually ""Darwin reset"" talking about, way think. Strap people, headed towards repeat history. 

Yay! Ignorance wins again! barf  Yeah I'm surprised add marching ants gif border along flashing letters  Whether ongsr unvaccinated population matter. ICUs get overrun choice lock down.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  hope concerns addressed pull rug feet like July. Lol taking vaccine possibly couldn’t studied long term affects bc it’s existed matter months real garbage. Couldn’t different pages tried. enjoy long term health affects tho bud 👍🏻 Tacos socialism them, wanted Thanksgiving US I’m assuming? ‘They didn’t send best.’ Maybe fitting social circle? seems lot people actually believe vaccine conspiracies, want kicked social groups getting vaccine. argument analogy good faith, sarcasm obtuse?

The reality pharmaceutical drug epidemic killing millions people every year caused largely pharmaceutical companies marketers push products. predatory industry takes advantage weakest members society personal profit shown time time lie whenever necessary increase margins. 

The opioid crisis natural human health crisis rather product engineered addictive made pharmaceutical companies billions dollars. fact everyone look past never happened happily usher world become entirely dependent companies remain alive honestly quite horrifying me. real. Keeps saying next month couple weeks, every couple weeks! metric pandemic worsened 10 times one year.

If can't see that's intellectually dishonest characterization, there's point continuing conversation. honestly can't believe spelled way proudly, really got there, actually demonstrated basic kind deceptive numerical trickery. death rate drops factor ten another 70 million people get vaccinated see waste time is. Right people dying things like strokes hospitals full. Get shot get way. resign true, that's stats discussed here. Outside cases hospitalized ailment testing asymptomatically. realm possible, probably statistically significant.

This hospitalization rate reported CT state health authority. hospitalized ICU patient numbers. got another vaccine ""researcher"". fb chance get vaccinated. still debate . Vaccination new. fence deciding whether happened fast. kill child fucking idiot. dare even say something like that. world God needed another angel. lmao One taken it.


The not.

Better study. Still flawed. Good luck convincing people, used also call 'global thermonuclear war' GTW argument, negative side effect could eventually cause end world. Someone create bot explaining fallacy, guess. I'm sure there's argument make undermines quickly.  course. profession life

The reason stupid phrase exists people Black Lives Matter stupid. mean, people going fight based idiotic partisan politics misinformation spread around.

Make people pay health insurance premium refuse get vaccinated, like nicotine users obese. force insurance companies pay Covid-related expenses vaccinated.

This adults, though, leave kids it. rule 6 feet though?  Sep 9, 2021 daily deaths 7 day average: 131

Sep 11, 2020 daily deaths 7 day average: 11

I understand numbers fine. metric pandemic worsened 10 times one year.

Covid seasonal. winter 2021 wave predicted scientists 9 months happened. ruling establishes States right mandate vaccinations, case rules federal government? many breakthrough cases severe? understanding NACI ""set"" rules here, provides recommendations. provinces really provinces. Alberta's eligible immunocompromised qualifications are:

* transplant recipients, including solid organ hematopoietic stem cell transplants 

* chronic kidney disease receiving regular dialysis 

* receiving active cancer treatment (chemotherapy, immunotherapy targeted therapies), excluding receiving hormonal therapy, radiation therapy surgery 

* taking certain medications autoimmune diseases including rituximab, ocrelizumab ofatumumab

Alberta also, said above, allows:

* Travellers jurisdictions recognize Covishield/AstraZeneca mixed series doses get additional dose(s) vaccine.

I even need show proof eligibility went third shot today. Pharmacist even ask. thing immunization sheet write ""3rd"" box tick. Delta plus 125 million unvaccinated Americans. might help decide.  Im sure super rich different set rules usually do. CDC,
Overall, 2,380,402 people 66.77% Connecticut's population fully vaccinated.

(Note , I'm sure counts 12y.o.'s not)

Still, breakthrough case numbers like really interesting points, herd immunity preventing transmission longer topic discussion. 

The Connecticut College student population going 2 110+ cases first week class even 98%+ vaccination rate student body also going something watch. Also. Testing positive mean sickness. could asymptomatic.  That’s certainly better early 2022 speculated. Cope  love title writes “Fully Vaccinated” caps. Typical anti-vaxx propaganda J&amp;J there’s booster info questions one dose. However started later others, also tested variants clinical trials lot efficacy drop off.

South Africa used 400k front line workers data suggests it’s fine. Anecdotal reports Reddit suggest Pfizer gets breakthroughs, least symptomatic ones. Uh, okay /u/iranisculpable, definitely able find send quick follow-up two months. ^this. 

This seems one main ‘logical’ reason people anti-vax smell violent uprising. Consider guns....  long accessible others. fine. Asking states federal pooled vaccine registry like asking pig fly. Dan Hardy longer company. Bisping, Felder, DC, Cruz color guys left besides Rogan, believe. CA, state (Vermont), non-consecutive, 15-minutes 24 hours close contact rule quarantine.
Cutting lunch time change fact many kids still wearing masks noses, they're still eating snacks, using bathrooms likely mask break so, sanitizing washing blowing noses, pulling masks cough sneeze, taking mask speech therapy ... Etc etc

 Further, noticed school reported since cutting kids' lunch time they've reduced /quarantine/ rates, I'm curious(worried) positivity rate following practice. fewer folks maybe /should/ quarantining aren't, seems reasonable assume there's higher chance infection spreading.


It's hard believe thing past anytime soon.  military ones weirdest think - literally sent line getting jab jab including stuff given public, unique situation? ridiculous obsessed people this. cars legal, alcohol legal? Maybe police everything people stop anyone dying?

If stopping kids going school thing stopping increase cases, keep home forever cos situation 5 years worse better.

Having kids school essential gets, parents. Ah see, don’t start worrying absolute, definitive proof bad you’re describing, even though late anything it. /s

This going yet another case underestimating virus, despite knowing past history underestimating virus. I'll quote Dr. William Haseltine, August 11th Article:

[Busting 12 Covid-19 Myths Could version previous archive.is link underestimated force SARS-CoV-2 impact global society since beginning. miscalculation everything virus spreads much adapt change led loss millions lives worldwide, infections deaths still rise day. think would learned lesson now—and yet face increasingly dangerous variants, rhetoric relentless optimism undergirded complacency inaction continues cloud better judgment.  year, neither first appearance virus Wuhan late 2019 the dire situation that capsized Italy March April 2020 constituted wake call. first waves Covid-19 cases hit Europe United States hard either population begin take pandemic seriously. year, again, the catastrophic outbreaks that slammed India past spring didn’t seem sufficient warning worse come. Instead many countries, US among them, began systematically dismantle web protective measures spent better part last year building. now.

We'll tools drastically reduce transmission, rather resign live Covid forever, next generation anti-Covid weapons arrive:

* Covid anti-viral drugs, Biden administration already committed 3 billion dollars.
* Pancoronavirus vaccines, designed produce broadly neutralizing antibodies thus resilient face new variants [New Hope Covid-19 Vaccine Protects evidence vaccine capable immunizing coronaviruses broadly—not SARS-CoV-2 new variants—could horizon. pancoronavirus vaccine come fruition, revising existing Covid-19 vaccines year year wouldn’t necessary.

[Intranasal COVID-19 Vaccine Reduces Disease Severity Blocks train cells line respiratory system virus, better equipped tackle virus starts infection,"" Munir explained. **The intranasal vaccine essentially ""nips SARS-CoV-2 bud"": virus cleared infection established, therefore reducing transmission virus others.** It’s absolute fact hospitalization death rate among vaccinated people (that contract all) staggering amount lower among unvaccinated. know that? Remember it’s second Delta may give hospital bills , it’s “B.1.617.2”. 

I think Delta executives refuse call strain it’s common name, Lol Try /r/COVID19_support /r/covidpositive, also use search bars (""nose bleed"").  hate discriminated ""blue"" quit job.

The people strongly believe anti-vax stuff tough choice.  Zut Alors! reminds me, need check boosters. Fuck me, another Greek letter. We’re going learn whole Greek alphabet guess.  ~25% staff going walk this.

To where? lol.   you’re thinking extortion blackmail.

Negotiation requires consent parties. think tiny minority risk job. couple good friends strongly anti Covidvax. kind want check see they’re coping this, think I’ll wait couple weeks they’ve gotten shock.  clear effectiveness, theory average adult 10% chance hospitalized Covid without vaccinated, Pfizer vaccine would make 2% chance hospitalized. (And reality, it’s probably even lower that. 10% number made example). Can't argue that. little confidence happen again.
Edit: first point.... Yes vaccinated ending hospital. unvaccinated are. Ah yes. Let's go back 1905 live lives policies. 

Sorry, ladies minorities. /u/PhoenixReborn cite; laws 116 years ago - must abide. TBD Gen X. many peers can't create GIFs memes.

Glad hear fairly tolerable! There’s always excuses something makes life easier.

Yes would incredibly difficult overcome challenges trying save lives not?

Ive make vast amount sacrifices pandemic, parents send kids school increase community spread feel less stressed.

Why keep making sacrifices someone kids undue I’ve sacrificed for?  solution vaccines...

The solution drive infection numbers way reduce opportunities mutation.

Vaccines non-neutralizing -- still get infected post-vaccination infections still produce massive quantities virus, chance mutation. vaccines outcome much, much better vaccinated person.

The means preventing infection remain same:

* masking
* social distancing
* testing, tracing, isolating infectious persons  Dont worry, doesnt get vaccine get covid sooner later, live die, survive good protection. I’m sure. think people slow OSHA issues mandates short term employee loss. 

As Amazon think it’ll tricky especially since classify delivery drivers contractors. 

Only time tell.

Edit - issue mandate mean say release policy. probably least several weeks point. may testing people countries? They're positive rate around 5%, that's lower US. *Oh, you…* prescient was. sadly prescient."
